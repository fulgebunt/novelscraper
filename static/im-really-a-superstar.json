Tomorrow, he had an interview at a radio station.

As he yawned, he switched on the television, so that he could watch the news. Suddenly, he realized that there was an additional silver ring on his left pinky. It was clearly not something that belonged to him. He tried as hard as he could to take it off, but it was to no avail. Not only that, but when he rubbed the surface of the ring, a touchable virtual screen suddenly appeared. It was written in the same font as the messages in his dream. It said, \u201cGame Ring initialized. New player incentive package, \u2018Randomly changing existing world background\u2019 is in preparation for augmentation.\u201dCounting down\u2026Three seconds\u2026Two seconds\u2026One second\u2026Incentive package augmentation initialization!Following that, Zhang Ye saw an alarming scene.The HTC phone that he had thrown on the bed began twisting and strangely changed shape. Even the brand changed and \u2018TCC\u2019 was engraved on it instead. One of the two pirated Xu Zhimo\u2019s poem collection placed by the window sill suddenly disappeared, while the other became Chen Tianmo\u2019s poem collection.He could not notice all the changes, as many things within his house were undergoing changes!What alarmed Zhang Ye the most were the changes on the television. The Changhong-branded television turned into a Feitian brand, which he had never heard of. And the main thing was the content being broadcast on the television!\u201cMango TV\u2019s new variety show, \u2018Glittering Radiance\u2019 breaks 1% viewership.\u201d\u201cWu Bang\u2019s latest movie, \u2018White Maiden\u2019 breaks 500 million in the box office.\u201d\u201cHeavenly Queen Zhang Yuanqi\u2019s new song failed once again. She will focus on the film industry from now on.\u201d\u201cYesterday, the work of world-famous artist Dake, \u201cBlue Sky\u201d, was auctioned off in America.\u201d\u201cMany people in the entertainment circle dedicated songs to the most influential Heavenly King of film of the 20th century, Chen Weishi\u2019s, 10th anniversary memorial concert. Heavenly King Sun Yu teared up on the spot while singing.\u201dZhang Ye looked at all of this for ten minutes in a state of shock. He still did not understand what had just happened. How did the television and cellphone change brands?Heavenly Queen Zhang Yuanqi?When was there a Heavenly Queen named Zhang Yuanqi?And the 10th anniversary memorial concert?Where did this Chen Weishi come out from?How could he not have heard of him? Zhang Yuanqi?Could it be that\u00a0Zhang Ziyi\u00a0had changed her stage name?Was \u2018Chen Weishi\u2019\u00a0Eason Chen\u2018s new name?That can\u2019t be right. Eason Chen is still alive!What sort of movie was \u201cWhite Maiden\u201d?Was it a film\u00a0Bai Yansong\u00a0f***ing starred in?When the f*** did he start filming movies?Zhang Ye rushed off the bed, in a panic to open the curtains. He saw everything outside changing. The two old trees by the road had disappeared. Replacing them was a flower bed. A high-rise building far in the distance had turned into a shorter building, with only six floors left. And not only had a few buildings that were originally gray in color subtly changed position, even the color of the stairs had changed to a brownish-white!Ding!Incentives augmentation has been completed!Note: The real world\u2019s background has been changed into a theoretical balance.Zhang Ye\u2019s face went pale. He picked up that unknown brand phone and examined\u00a0it. The date and time were right. Today was the day two months after he had graduated from college. After flipping through a few pages of his contacts, he purposely called a few people. His close friends were still the same, but how could the changes in the surroundings be explained? Also, what was this game ring on his hand? Had the game ring really altered reality?Zhang Ye could not believe it, as he switched on his computer to check the Internet. The more he browsed, the more frightened he became.It had changed!Everything had changed!There was no one in the show hosting industry named \u201cHe Jiong\u201d or \u201cXie Na\u201d.The music industry no longer had people like Eason Chen or\u00a0Jacky Cheung.The film industry no longer had people like\u00a0Feng Xiaogang,\u00a0Sun Honglei, etc.In China and in foreign countries, people like\u00a0Qi Baishi\u00a0or Pablo Picasso no longer existed in the world of calligraphy or painting.The divine song, \u201cPerturbed\u201c?Mo Yan\u2018s novels?Beethoven\u2019s piano pieces?The movie, \u201cTransformers\u201d?The variety show, \u201cThe Voice of China\u201c?The famous painting, \u201cMona Lisa\u201d?They were all gone!Seeing all of these things being randomly changed by the unknown game, he wondered if these were the game rewards he had obtained as the sole player. However, how did reality become a game?And what sort of game was this?\u201cContra\u201d, or \u201cSuper Mario\u201d?Should he use his head to smash at a wall, causing a small magical mushroom to burst out, which could make him bigger?Of course, there were things that did not change. Some important historical figures, world patterns and social environments had not changed. The\u00a0Master Kong\u00a0instant noodles on the table were still the same. LV was still a world-famous brand. A lot of things had not been modified. Was this the so-called \u201crandomness\u201d?Something supernatural had happened!What the heck had happened?At this moment, thumps were heard. Someone outside was knocking on his door. The knocks were quite loud and were definitely done by hammering the door with a lot of strength!Zhang Ye guessed who it was and pretended not to hear it.After the person knocked a few more times, the clinking of keys could be heard and the door was suddenly opened!Zhang Ye looked at the person who came in. He was thinking that even though the world had changed, the landlady was still the same landlady.A woman in her thirties walked over. She looked very beautiful. Sometimes, the two words \u201cvery beautiful\u201d were very hard to use in describing her. For example, she had clearly just washed her hair. Her head was still wrapped in a white towel, but her beauty, which could overthrow states and cities, could not be concealed. Her figure was exceptionally good. Her skin\u2019s elasticity was clearly revealed and it appeared very sharp.However, one could only understand this beautiful woman\u2019s mean side through being in close contact with her for a few days. She could be as venomous with her words as you wanted. If not, how could she still be unmarried at this age? Just that mouth of hers made many unable to tolerate her!Seeing that Zhang Ye was at home, Rao Aimin cleared her throat and laughed without a smile, \u201cKid, are you trying to play hide and seek with me? Why did you not respond when I was knocking all day? Are you playing dead?\u201dZhang Ye turned slightly awkward, \u201cLandlady, you came?\u201dRao Aimin conveniently sat down in the living room. With a smashing sound, she slammed a calculator onto the table. Zhang Ye had seen her calculator numerous times in the past. Previously, it was a Casio brand, but now it had changed into a new brand that he had never heard of before. It started with a \u201cK\u201d. It even looked like the calculator businesses had been altered. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me what I\u2019m here for? I\u2019m here to collect rent!\u201d Her fingers hammered on the calculator in a very well-versed fashion. \u201cYou haven\u2019t handed over this month\u2019s rent. Adding up last month\u2019s utilities, I have already calculated them for you. The total becomes 2,582. I have already reminded you several times. Not one cent less is allowed! I tell you, Little Zhang.. I allowed you to pay rent monthly, only because you were from Beijing. Go ask around; which place would not first require you to put up a three-month rental deposit? How much special treatment have I given you?\u201dZhang Ye smiled wryly, \u201cPlease give me another few more days. I really don\u2019t have any money on hand right now. Once I find a job, I\u2019ll give it to you.\u201dRao Aimin elegantly swept her fingers, \u201cIf you don\u2019t have any money, get lost now!\u201dZhang Ye pleaded, \u201cYou know my situation.The rent I previously gave you was all money from my elders. I only have that much money. If you were to chase me away, I can only return to stay with my parents. I had already told them I would move out and be independent once I graduated. How can I just go back with my face still intact? Auntie, look at our floor. The entire row\u2019s commercial and residential apartments are all yours. Your wealth doesn\u2019t lack just this bit of money. About this, I have an interview at the Beijing Broadcasting Television Station this afternoon. If I really become a host, I will make up for the rent once I get my salary.\u201dRao Aimin glanced at him and, with contempt, said, \u201cYou? Become a host? Cut it out. With your looks and height, who would pay attention to you in a crowd of people? You only dream all day of becoming a star. You think it\u2019s that easy to become a celebrity? If you can become a host, then this old aunt will dare to appear in the Spring Festival Ceremony tomorrow!\u201dZhang Ye said, \u201cAnyways, just give me a few more days. I\u2026\u201dRao Aimin ignored it, \u201cNo way!\u201dZhang Ye said, \u201cDon\u2019t you see that I haven\u2019t even eaten breakfast at all for the past few days? I really don\u2019t have enough money.\u201d\u201cWhat do I have to do with you not eating? Eh?\u201d Rao Aimin said with an inhumane expression.After fussing for a long time, he managed to get the landlady to leave. After about ten minutes, Rao Aimin, who was in pajamas, came back. She did not knock on the door and immediately used her key to open the door.Zhang Ye thought Big Sister Rao was here to reclaim her money, so he carefully said, \u201cLandlady auntie, you\u2026\u201dRao Aimin threw a breakfast set onto the table and coldly grunted, \u201cI couldn\u2019t eat it alone. Kid, you lucked out. Let me tell you. Even though jobs are not easy to get these days, you are still a graduate from the Media College; how can you not get a job to make ends meet? Stop clinging to a single tree \u2018til you hang yourself on it!\u201dZhang Ye was surprised and quickly said, \u201cThank you. I got it.\u201dRao Aimin, with her cold, beautiful face, left by slamming the door.Zhang Ye felt his heart go warm. Looking at the breakfast on the table, it was still hot. Clearly, it was not leftovers from this older sister Rao. It was definitely something that she had especially went down to buy after she heard Zhang Ye say that he had not eaten breakfast for a few days. Zhang Ye knew older that sister Rao was someone who was warm on the inside, but cold on the outside. She may have a venomous tongue, but she still cared about him. Actually, he also understood what older sister Rao meant. However, Zhang Ye had always had dreams of making it big since he was young. He wanted to stand on a stage, facing the public. As such, he had never considered doing jobs that involved being behind the scenes.Zhang Ye went out by taking the elevator downstairs.On the street, Zhang Ye looked all around. He realized that the road was familiar, yet strange. The billboard commercials were all of celebrities that he did not know. Some business shops were playing the hottest popular music that Zhang Ye had never heard before. As he walked through this familiar, yet strange, street, he found it hard to adapt. He felt like he did not match with this altered world. Many things had changed. Or, it could be said that this was no longer the world from Zhang Ye\u2019s past.It was August. The air was still hot and disturbing.It was not scientific!Really unscientific!Zhang Ye was, after all, a graduate from a prestigious university. Of course, he could not easily accept this reality. What day and age was this? It was no longer an ancient society where superstitions, such as demons and ghosts, existed. Being superstitious only brought harm. This was something even elementary school kids knew. Everything boiled down to science. One had to firmly believe in the power of science. As such, Zhang Ye\u2019s eyes turned solemn. He pulled out a one-Yuan coin from his pocket respectfully and he threw it up in the air earnestly. \u201cIf it\u2019s heads, then this explains that this world\u2019s background has really been changed by the game. If it\u2019s tails, then it says that everything is fake.\u201dDing Ling Ling.The coin landed on the ground. Heads!Zhang Ye\u2019s vision went black. It wasn\u2019t fake. Everything was real!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The air was still hot and disturbing.That\u2019s not right. This description of the environment had already been written.It was August. The air was still\u2026 disturbingly hot. Right, that hasn\u2019t been used yet.This world\u2019s Beijing Radio Station had merged with the Beijing Television Station a few years ago. Although they\u00a0had merged, their offices were separate. Under the radio broadcasting building, Zhang Ye adjusted his western suit. He looked like a dog\u2026 a respectful person, before walking in. All the official employees had already started work early in the day. Now, a large portion of the people who entered were interview candidates, like Zhang Ye.There was still some time; let\u2019s examine the ring.Zhang Ye lowered his head as he fiddled with the mysterious game ring on his left hand. The eye-catching screen could only be seen by him. The people surrounding him did not notice the screen. Zhang Ye felt a chill run down his back. It was too sinister. Could something have gone wrong with his brain? So as to result in such serious illusions? There was a second when he had thought that he would have to eat the brain supplement, Brain White Gold, for life.The virtual screen had a few options.[Reputation]: 199,983.[Items]: None.[Merchant Shop]: Not unlocked.[Lottery]: Obtain a treasure chest prize.(Note: The increment of Reputation is related to the player's fame, exposure, achievement, trust, reputation and other related factors. The items in the Merchant Shop and Lottery can be bought using Reputation points. Reputation is total Reputation gained since the player's birth until today.)190,000+ Reputation points?Zhang Ye wondered for a while. He had obtained a few awards when he was in elementary school for writing composition. He also did alright in his studies during middle and high school. He was frequently praised by his teachers. Right, he even had the experience of going on TV. He and his dormitory mates in college were interviewed by a CCTV reporter on the streets in Xidan. Before the reporter could hand over a microphone to him, Zhang Ye had answered immediately, \u201cI\u2019m very happy.\u201d Back then, the CCTV reporter was rendered speechless and said, \u201cWe aren\u2019t asking that, we are asking if you feel\u2026\u201d And before he finished speaking, Zhang Ye, who seemed to be deep in thought, suddenly said loudly, \u201cSocialism is good.\u201d Well, it was unknown if it had been\u00a0broadcast, in the end.Were all these Reputation points obtained from that? To earn 190,000+ Reputation over 23 years? It seemed pretty good? However, Zhang Ye quickly did not think so anymore. When he opened the virtual screen\u2019s options to see what he could buy with his Reputation points, he was rendered speechless for a long time.The Merchant Shop had not been unlocked, so he could only click on the Lottery choice.[Lottery]: Requires 100,000 Reputation points. Upon purchasing, the game will randomly choose a treasure chest.Heavens. After all that he had done in his like, he had gathered enough Reputation points just to draw once in the Lottery? Just short of drawing twice? With the mindset of trying his luck with the Lottery, he touched the screen with his hand. It had a solid feeling. After confirming his selection on the prompted display, 100,000 points were spent and his Reputation immediately became 99,983. The Lottery interface flashed and a virtual wheel appeared. There was a needle and a button. On the wheel were the words, \u201cConsumption Category\u201d, \u201cStats Category\u201d, \u201cSkills Category\u201d and \u201cSpecial Category\u201d. Each category had a respective color and its own region. The four regions were different in size. The Consumption Category took up a large portion of the wheel \u2013 nearly half of it. Next up were the Stats and Skills Categories. Together, they took up nearly the other half of the wheel. The smallest region was the Special Category. It only took up a tiny region and was nearly invisible.A game screen introduction appeared!Category Explanation:[Consumption Category]: One-time use disposable consumable item.[Stats Category]: Permanently increasing a stat.[Skills Category]: Skill's experience item.[Special Category]: Adds the purchasing privilege of buying a certain Merchant item.Note: The treasure chest from the item category where the pointer stably stops will be the item that will be obtained.Zhang Ye was confused. He could only try by pressing the button to begin the lottery. Ba Da! The Lottery began. The needle on the wheel kept moving as the wheel rotated clockwise extremely fast. After a few seconds, the needle slowed down and finally landed on the biggest area on the wheel, the Consumption Category.The Lottery was completed!A tiny golden treasure chest appeared. The prize was automatically stored in his inventory. And within his inventory appeared an icon of a \u201csmall golden treasure chest\u201d! How do you use it? Zhang Ye tried stretching his hand into the inventory. His hand actually entered as if there was a space within it. As he touched the floating Treasure Chest (Small), he grabbed it and opened the treasure chest that no one else could see, while still on the street. With a flash of golden light, the treasure chest opened!It was a tiny crystal!Displayed Item: [Save].Item Description: One-time use disposable consumable item. Saves a record. This save file can only be stored for half an hour.Save? This was extremely familiar to Zhang Ye. Anyone who had played games knew that saves were used just before closing the game, or to redo a certain event later on. It could only be stored for 30 minutes? Did that mean that it could not be used 30 minutes after it had been used? The save would be invalidated? As for the\u00a0Lottery and the treasure chests, they\u00a0were not foreign to him. Many games had a Lottery. Treasure chests of different grades resulted in different grades of items. The probability was also different. Zhang Ye took the Save crystal out. The golden treasure chest immediately disappeared into points of light. Zhang Ye tinkered around with it. Pa! Accidentally, he had crushed the crystal.Saving...Saving completed!At that moment, time seemed to stop for a second. Everything stood still!When everything was restored, the ring\u2019s interface had one more option. \u201cLoad Save\u201d was displayed.The record was saved just like this? Zhang Ye touched his nose, still confused. Newbie incentive? Background change? Treasure chest Lottery? Items? Save? Was he really playing a game?\u201cThe interview is at 10 A.M. Let\u2019s hurry.\u201d\u201cBrother Sun, what\u2019s the hurry? You will definitely be accepted.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not necessarily true. They will only be hiring two people for the radio host position. I heard that there were more than 20 people that applied for the written interview. The competition is fierce.\u201d\u201cIndeed. The position for hosts are the most popular. Old Zhou and I have comparatively less pressure. I applied to be an editor, while Old Zhou applied to be an operator. There is less competition, since fewer people applied for it.\u201dSome people said this as they walked in.Zhang Ye looked at the time. He ignored researching the game ring and hurried upstairs. The interview today was too important for him. He had thought through his development path properly. With his qualities and image, should he be a television host? A singer? A movie star? He did not even qualify to be a villain in a movie. He wasn\u2019t outstanding and would never become popular. Thinking it through, it was best that he start off as a radio host. The requirement of having good looks were lower by a tiny bit. The listeners would only have contact with his voice, so it was the best position for him to begin in. It was also the springboard for his future development. He could not fail at this!Second floor.Radio host interview venue.There were over 20 people in the corridor. Everyone was a competing against each other, so the atmosphere was peppered with silence.Zhang Ye glanced around and suddenly felt a chill.All of the 20+ people were handsome and beautiful\u2026 except him.All of the 20+ people were aged between 25 and 30 and had experience\u2026 except him.Zhang Ye\u2019s only advantage was that he was trained specially for the job. He was a graduate from the Media College\u2019s broadcasting department. Besides that, he didn\u2019t have a single advantage. After graduation, Zhang Ye had also interviewed at a few broadcasting media companies, but he was eliminated at the interview phase. Zhang Ye knew that it was because he lacked the looks and experience.\u201cSun Hongwei.\u201d\u201cHere.\u201d\u201cCome on in.\u201dThe first person was brought into the room. The interview was over in five minutes. When the next person was called inside, the people beside him quickly asked about the interview. However, after a few times, no one asked anymore. This was because everyone\u2019s interview was different. Some were asked to interact on the spot with a difficult audience. Some were asked to debate on a topic. These differences were here to understand the candidate\u2019s overall quality.\u201cFifth person, Zhang Ye.\u201d a female assistant called out with a list in her hand.Zhang Ye took a deep breath and stood up. He would be lying if he said he wasn\u2019t nervous.Within the room were eight\u00a0interviewers. There were both men and women and they looked serious.Seeing Zhang Ye, at least two of them frowned. It was unknown what they found unsatisfactory.Zhang Ye gently bowed. He handed over the required recordings of his information and speech to the interviewer before returning to his seat. He began introducing himself, \u201cDear Teachers*, how are you? My name is Zhang Ye. I\u2019m 23 years old this year and I graduated from the Media College\u2019s broadcasting major. I\u2026\u201dA middle-aged man impolitely interrupted, \u201cWe have your resume, so you don\u2019t have to repeat it.\u201d He looked down at the information in his hands, \u201cOh, your written test results barely made the cut.\u201dThe middle-aged woman beside him exchanged looks with him and took out a manuscript. She laid it on the table and said coldly, \u201cThere are only two questions for the interview. The first is for you to use your fastest speed to finish reading the manuscript and then read it off script.\u201dOff script?It was that simple?Zhang Ye was overjoyed. Although going off script was not his best trait, it was not too difficult for him. He had undergone systematic training on this, back in college. It was considered part of the basics. As such, he walked up and picked up the manuscript and looked at it. There were about a thousand words. It was very long.\u00a0But just as Zhang Ye was feeling confident that he could memorize all these words, the middle-aged woman stretched out her hands and took the manuscript from Zhang Ye\u2019s hands after ten seconds.\u201cOh? I haven\u2019t finished reading it.\u201d Zhang Ye said in surprise.\u201cThat\u2019s it. Read it.\u201d The middle-aged woman said indifferently.The other interviewers did not have any reaction. It appeared very normal.However, Zhang Ye was in a daze, \u201cTeacher, it was just ten seconds and there were a thousand words\u2026\u201dThe middle-aged man said unhappily, \u201cIf you need a day\u2019s time to memorize it, then I can just grab anyone on the street to do it. Why would we need an interview? Since we asked you to recite it, recite it! Why are you saying so much nonsense!?\u201dZhang Ye was a bit angry, \u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cSay as much off script as you can.\u201d The middle-aged woman said impatiently, \u201cHurry up! There are still more than ten people after you!\u201dZhang Ye swallowed his anger and began reciting, \u201cA notary organization, which ensures judicial activities and the stability of social order in our country, is a special lawful cause. Notarization is a notary organization that depends on natural persons, lawful persons, or\u2026or\u2026\u201d After ten seconds, that was all that he had read.A few of the interviewers scribbled something on their books.Following that, the middle-aged man waved his hand, \u201cThat\u2019s it. There\u2019s no need to ask the second question. Next.\u201dZhang Ye knew that he had failed at his interview once again. He was disgruntled. Weren\u2019t these people being too unreasonable? You didn\u2019t even tell me how much time I had and asked me to go off script. In the end, you wanted me to begin just after ten seconds? Not to mention\u00a0reciting it, I want to see you try reading a thousand words in ten seconds! If you can really finish it from beginning to end, then I\u2019ll eat the\u00a0Chang\u2019e 3! Eh, forget it. The country would not let me eat that.At the last moment before he walked out of the interview room, he heard the faint voice of an interviewer behind him, \u201cIn the future, people with such looks do not need to go through the interview. It\u2019s a waste of our time!\u201dZhang Ye heard this. Only then did he realize that the moment he entered, he had been given a death sentence. They had purposely given him an interview question that no one could answer, even under the threat of death!Maddening!I\u2019m wasting your time?You didn\u2019t even give me a chance to answer! I don\u2019t believe it!Zhang Ye, who was in the corridor, felt like his heart had been wrenched out. He recalled the save record. The time that had passed since he had saved was still under 30 minutes and it was still within the save record\u2019s effective time range. He decided to use it as a last resort as he opened up the ring\u2019s game interface. Looking at the \u201cLoad Save\u201d option, he gritted his teeth as he pressed down on it. He did not know if it would work!Reading Save...Reading completed!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was August. The air was still hot and disturbing. Eh, why does Zhang Ye like to use this to describe his environment?It isn\u2019t that his vocabulary is lacking, nor is it because he is lacking in literary knowledge, resulting in him knowing only those few descriptive phrases. It really isn\u2019t. Seriously, it really isn\u2019t. It\u2019s because\u2026because\u2026nevermind. You will never understand, no matter how much I explain our artists\u2019 world!\u201cThe interview is at 10 A.M. Let\u2019s hurry.\u201d\u201cBrother Sun, what\u2019s the hurry? You will definitely be accepted.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not necessarily true. They will only be hiring two people for the radio host position. I heard that there were more than 20 people that applied for the written interview. The competition is fierce.\u201dAs the changes caught him off-guard, Zhang Ye did not catch his footing and stumbled to the ground. As he helped himself up, he looked around. This was no longer the corridor from before. He was now standing in front of the radio broadcasting station\u2019s entrance again. This was where he had previously saved. Even the dialogue of the candidates that had been heard after saving was exactly the same. Looking at the time on his cell phone, he had really returned to a time that was half an hour ago!God! This\u2026Let\u2019s not think too much. There are important matters to do!Zhang Ye thought through it once and came around. Now was not the time to research on what had happened. He absolutely needed to get the job of being a host. Saving had given him a chance to redo it again. Even if he didn\u2019t understand what had happened, he still had to take advantage of the opportunity. He didn\u2019t go up the building. Instead, he searched the internet on his cellphone. As he remembered the first line of the interview, it was very easy to find it. Zhang Ye quickly found the article. It was a research thesis of some unknown student in a university in the South. He guessed that the interviewers had randomly found it on the internet. He only had about 25 minutes or so left. Without saying another word, he immediately started memorizing and reciting it! The 1000-word manuscript was very long. Thankfully, it wasn\u2019t some ancient text or classic. As the entire thesis wasn\u2019t full of abstruse words, and with every word related to the next and being in accordance with common sense and general knowledge, it wasn\u2019t that difficult to memorize it. Besides, Zhang Ye had some knowledge of the law, so he knew some of those words.He needed to memorize it. Success or failure rested on this!\u2026\u2026In the broadcasting building, at the interview venue.A female assistant opened the door and looked at her list, \u201cZhang Ye.\u201d After calling once, with no one responding, she repeated, \u201cIs Zhang Ye here? It\u2019s your turn!\u201dAt the end of the corridor, Zhang Ye briskly walked over with his mouth seemingly chanting, \u201cI\u2019m here. I\u2019m here!\u201dThe female assistant looked at him with suspicion. Having seen hundreds of interviewees this year, this was the first time that she had seen\u00a0someone chanting. Were monks and priests prepared to join the workforce?In the room.During the idle time between interviews, the eight people were drinking tea and exchanging their views.A 40+-year-old Li Honglian said disappointedly, \u201cThis batch of interviewees is too average.\u201dAn older Zhao Guozhou also said, \u201cYeah.\u00a0It\u2019s\u00a0much worse than the interviews from half a year ago. What use is having a good written score? They lack in ability!\u201dA youth behind him said, \u201cLeaders, there are still quite a few people still to be interviewed. There should be someone good.\u201d\u201cHopefully.\u00a0But I think it\u2019s hopeless.\u201d Zhao Guozhou smacked his lips, \u201cPreviously, that Little Xu* was alright. If there\u2019s no other choice, our channel will want him.\u201dLi Honglian leered, \u201cI think Little Xu isn\u2019t bad, too.\u201dNow, the door was opened after a knock. The next interviewee, Zhang Ye, entered.The people stopped their idle chatter and glanced at him, sizing him up.\u201cDear teachers, how are you?\u201d Knowing that they would interrupt his self-introduction, Zhang Ye simply changed his introduction and felt free. To put it bluntly, he was still disgruntled and angry. This fellow\u2019s temper was usually bad. If people gave him an inch of respect, he would return a foot of respect. \u201cMy real name is Zhang Ye.\u201dZhao Guozhou burst into laughter, \u201cYou still have a stage name?\u201dZhang Ye simply replied, \u201cI have two stage names, one is \u201cZhang Tenglan\u201d* and the other is \u201cZhang Jingkong\u201d*.\u201dThis world no longer had these two \u201cgreat people\u201d. The interviewers did not understand that they had been unknowingly ridiculed by Zhang Ye.Li Honglian was ignoring Zhang Ye, as she had her head lowered to read his resume.The result was the same. The same scene and the same expressions. This time, Zhang Ye could sensitively detect two interviewers slightly frowning. This was their dissatisfaction with Zhang Ye\u2019s appearance. It was weird. Even in an industry where the audience could not see the face of the broadcaster, the broadcasting host was still expected to have good looks. What did it mean to be good? It meant that one needed to look better than the vast majority of people. It had always been like this for broadcasting hosts.Zhao Guozhou and Li Honglian, who was sitting beside Zhao Guozhou, sat in the middle and were the main judges. As the two radio hosts that would be hired were to be directly under their supervision respectively, they were very serious with their selection. No one wanted trouble for themselves, so when they saw Zhang Ye with his average looks, they had already crossed him out mentally. Furthermore, Zhang Ye had zero working experience listed on his resume. He still needed some training before he could take over the job, so they did not even consider him for the position. It was not bad being in a specialized major, but there were many that graduated from the broadcasting specialization major. And how many of them had become a host? Only a handful of people who were extremely outstanding had managed to do so.Zhao Guozhou and Li Honglian exchanged glances and understood the thoughts of each other. This person was definitely not suitable. They would randomly give him a question and shoo him away \u2013 to prevent wasting time!Li Honglian took out a manuscript in the same posture as before and glanced at Zhang Ye, \u201cThere are only two questions for the interview. The first is for you to use your fastest speed to finish reading the manuscript and then read it off script.\u201dZhang Ye, who came back from a save record, knew their attitude and wish to make it difficult for him, so he stood up and took it without any expression.As expected, in just ten seconds, Li Honglian had meanly taken away the manuscript. \u201cThat\u2019s it. Read it.\u201dThe other interviewers also knew in their hearts. Ten seconds? Even if it was an experienced person who had decades in the industry, that person would not be able to memorize more than a hundred words in ten seconds, let alone a mere graduate. Eh, it should be said that ten seconds was only enough for them to read 200 words. And even so, they would only get about 40-50% of those 200 words right while reciting. And why would that not even pass? That\u2019s because this manuscript had more than 900 words. It was only about a fifth! If one could memorize and recite 300 words in ten seconds, only then was that a perfect score. But everyone knew it was impossible.They were purposely making it difficult for Zhang Ye and it was to the point where they were just disguising their intentions of telling Zhang Ye that he lacked the qualities and abilities. But what made them feel strange was that Zhang Ye did not have any questioning reaction with the ten seconds of memorizing time. He remained extremely calm and returned slowly to his seat.Li Honglian fell into a daze as she tried to find anger and surprise on Zhang Ye\u2019s face, but she could not find anything.The other interviewers found it bizarre, too. Was this kid really stupid, really stupid, or really stupid? We\u2019d made it difficult for him, yet he did not have a single reaction? It seemed like they had done right. This silly kid would be useless, even if he was recruited. He was so stupid and not sharp-minded. He would not amount to much.Zhao Guozhou urged, \u201cBegin! Hurry up! There are many people behind you, who are waiting!\u201dLi Honglian and the other interviewers immediately gave Zhang Ye a score on his interview results. They did not bother listening before scoring. One wrote 20 points, while another wrote 15 points. They were all very low scores. Following that, they flipped to the next interviewee\u2019s resume.Zhang Ye was not in a hurry, even with their urging. He looked at them calmly and recited in a rhythmic fashion, \u201cA notary organization, which ensures judicial activities and the stability of social order in our country, is a special lawful cause. Notarization is done by a notary organization that depends on natural persons, lawful persons or the other applications of other groups. Under the legal procedures set up by the courts, matters that deal with the law or documents that are needed to certify the activity require the procedures of a notary activity to be done in accordance with the law\u2026\u201dWhen Zhang Ye went off script for a hundred words, Zhao Guozhou raised his head.When he went off script for 200 words, Li Honglian gasped and looked at him with surprise.When he went off script for 300 words, all the interviewers placed the things in their hands down and looked at Zhang Ye in surprise!Zhang Ye was not affected by anyone and kept going on. \u201cBecause if the relevant parties provide false materials or fail to go through notarized procedures to obtain legal certifications, then there is a negative effect on the reputation of the publicly recognized bodies. Hence, faith is the most basic requirement in the notary industry\u2026\u201dIn Zhao Guozhou and Li Honglian\u2019s eyes, anyone who could memorize 300 words was a miracle and was something impossible, but Zhang Ye was still reciting!\u201cThis\u2026\u201d300 words!500 words!800 words!The interviewers\u2019 faces turned aghast!When the last paragraph was recited, Zhang Ye remained at his constant pace, \u201cAs an embodiment of integrity, a system that builds on the society\u2019s trust, a notary allows people to accept and adopt means to acquire trust.\u201d With a pause, he cleared his throat, \u201cThank you, Teachers. I\u2019ve finished reciting!\u201dA female interviewer\u2019s pen dropped from her hand. \u201cLu Lu\u201d, it rolled down to the floor!Zhao Guozhou was in shock and turned his head sideways, \u201cOld Li*? This\u2026 Was it memorized correctly?\u201dLi Honglian looked at the manuscript in her hand and gasped, \u201c\u2026920 words, recited verbatim!\u201dThe leftmost interviewer nearly fell from his chair as he said in surprise, \u201cHow did you do it? Ten seconds? You memorized it all?\u201dZhang Ye smiled, \u201cI read things a bit faster than others and have a relatively good memory. A glance would be sufficient.\u201dTen seconds was just enough to sweep through over 900 words. This wasn\u2019t just fast, this was f***ing too fast! The person even wanted to ask if Zhang Ye had previously memorized the thesis, but he knew it was impossible. This thesis was unknown and was randomly found on the internet. Besides, there was no way it could have been disclosed beforehand. Li Honglian also randomly grabbed a topic, so how could that person know in advance!?F***! Are you even human?Zhang Ye\u2019s act had shocked them all!A few interviewers were greatly surprised, as if they had seen a ghost!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They planned to brush Zhang Ye off with the first, but now under these circumstances, the eight interviewers looked at each other without knowing how to give a score. According to the on-the-spot performance, giving this young man a hundred points was necessary. No, it wasn\u2019t too much to give 200!He had read it in ten seconds? Recited more than 900 words off script?What sort of godly person could do this?Previously, the interviewers thought Zhang Ye was an idiot for not having any expression. However, apparently it was because he was extremely confident. He had never found the thousand words a problem. Correspondingly, it was them, as interviewers, who were idiots!However, if they were to give Zhang Ye a perfect score, then it was equivalent to hiring him. This young man\u2019s written test results may have passed, but it was not outstanding amongst the more than 20 people. The differences between the candidates weren\u2019t huge, so the interview was the best way to differentiate them. 80 points was a very high score, so giving a perfect score meant that he would definitely be ranked in the top two amongst the more than 20 people. Unfortunately, Zhang Ye\u2019s qualifications were not acceptable to them. His looks were too average and even a radio host who usually does not need to show his face would still need to show his face occasionally. For example, there would be activities or public appearances. If his looks did not make the cut, it would affect the listeners after they saw him. Hence, good looks and a tall height were essential.Li Honglian was in a dilemma, \u201cOld Zhao?\u201dZhao Guozhou sighed and said earnestly to Zhang Ye, \u201cLittle Zhang, we can tell from the written interview that you are a rare talent. Furthermore, you are a specialized course graduate. We should greatly welcome you, and indeed that is the case. However, you\u2026chose the wrong profession. I do not need to talk about your looks. I guess your college\u2019s teachers have given you advice on that matter. The radio profession is like that. How about this? I\u2019ll give you a backdoor and we don\u2019t need to have the second interview question. There are many positions in our radio station. As long as it\u2019s a behind-the-scenes position and not a host, you can choose any of them. I will pass you immediately. Bring your things tomorrow and report for work. If you want to go down the road of being a host, then it is really not easy. Think through my words.\u201dWithout a second thought, Zhang Ye said, \u201cTeacher, thank you for your kindness. I know my qualifications make my path arduous. However, I only want to apply to be a broadcasting host.\u201d This was his insistence on his dreams. If he were willing to switch to another job, Zhang Ye would have done so long ago. He would not have remained jobless to this day.Zhao Guozhou waved his hand. This kid sure didn\u2019t listen to advice.Li Honglian also smacked her lips, \u201cAre you sure? Let me give you a warning. The second interview question is not easier than the first. It\u2019s almost impossible for you to pass. Young lad, it\u2019s not that we are purposely making it difficult for you. Interviews are like that. We give a question of appropriate difficulty according to the candidate\u2019s qualifications. Your qualifications really can\u2019t pass the threshold needed for a broadcasting host. That\u2019s why our questions are correspondingly harder. As such, you need to have far more outstanding talent in order to mask the qualifications you lack. I advise you to think over Director Zhao\u2019s words.\u201dWasn\u2019t this making it difficult?You are intentionally making it difficult!Zhang Ye was a very stubborn man, and insisted, \u201cThere is no need to think about it further. Please give your second question.\u201dLi Honglian was exasperated at his failure to make good. She shook her head and was also angry. \u201cAlright, I am in charge of the foreign language channel. There are many English-speaking talents in the station, but we are lacking a person with talent in Russian. This recruiter was originally hoping to get someone who had a basic foundation in Russian. If you can compose a modern poem in Russian that makes us satisfied, then I\u2019ll give you full marks for the interview!\u201dRussian?He still needed to compose a poem in Russian?Zhao Guozhou looked sideways at Li Honglian and did not make a sound. It was a tacit consent.The other interviewers had different expressions on their faces. Zhang Ye had showcased something that had left them speechless. They knew Zhang Ye was someone with ability, but not having good looks in the broadcasting host profession was a lethal deathblow. Except for a very few people with extremely outstanding talent, very few people could break through this situation. Hence, it could be seen from the second question that Li Honglian was not giving Zhang Ye an inkling of a chance. Russian? Zhang Ye\u2019s resume was right in front of them. The foreign language listed there was only English. That was the only foreign language taught in the university. He wasn\u2019t in a foreign language major and, even if he was in a specialized class, a teacher would not be so free as to teach Russian! Without knowing this language, there was no reason to even mention composing poems. If you couldn\u2019t even speak it, how could you compose it?Zhang Ye had already expected that the second question would not be easy, but he never expected it to be of such difficulty. Not a single chance was given to him. And it was in Russian? Zhang Ye wasn\u2019t even good at English. He had barely passed the basic eligibility test for graduation, so how could he know some bullsh*t Russian!? Damn it, I have a harder path ahead, just because I\u2019m not good looking? And I need to suffer such unfair treatment and torture? What are you basing it on? What are you basing your decision on that makes you think I can\u2019t make the cut? Why would no one give me a chance? I want fairness! Is that so hard?Li Honglian\u2019s nails were tinkling on her tea cup. \u201cThe poem needs to be an original work of yours. Do not read the famous works of the famous Chen Tianmo or Wells. I\u2019m looking at your language skills and also your literature knowledge. These are all related. Begin.\u201d\u2018And it had to be an original poem? A interviewer behind even thought in his mind, \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of carrying on? Just get the next person. Even a person who professionally does Russian would not be able to use Russian to compose a poem, much less a person who doesn\u2019t know Russian!Chen Tianmo?Wells?Who are they? Why does it sound familiar?Zhang Ye suddenly recalled. Chen Tianmo was someone he caught a glimpse of when he searched the internet. He was now one of the most famous poets in the country. In the altered world, Zhang Ye\u2019s Xu Zhimo poem collection by the window sill had changed into Chen Tianmo\u2019s! He had nearly forgotten that this world no longer had Xu Zhimo or Pushkin. Replacing them were this world\u2019s poets and works he had never seen before. Zhang Ye finally refocused and had a brilliant flash in his mind. If he had never seen the poems in this world, then this world would definitely not have seen the famous poems of his world!Zhao Guozhou was slightly sympathetic and added on, \u201cLittle Zhang, it\u2019s not too late to regret now. My offer still stands. You don\u2019t have to take the second question\u2019s test. I will arrange for a behind-the-scenes position for you.\u201dDon\u2019t take the test?Why should I not take the test?Zhang Ye was already fed up. They had made it difficult for him so many times. Were they even done? You want an original poem in Russian? Sure! I\u2019ll create a poem today just for you! I don\u2019t know Russian? So what! Zhang Ye had never learned Russian, but that did not mean he didn\u2019t know Russian poems! Were these two sentences in conflict? It was completely not in conflict. Back in his college days, the broadcasting major teachers would create all sorts of difficult problems to train them. For example, Zhang Ye clearly remembered one from the second semester of his third year. Their vocal teacher had brought a Russian pronunciation recording of a famous Russian prose to force Zhang Ye and company to memorize it. Zhang Ye and his classmates found it torturous and took a month before they memorized it. Those days were like a nightmare. But only after memorizing it did Zhang Ye understand his teacher\u2019s intentions. His speaking ability and memory had greatly increased. This way of memorizing something and not through understanding the meaning behind the words was very taxing. It was likely that all those who came from the specialized class had such a training experience.\u201cIf you can\u2019t do it, let\u2019s get the next person.\u201d Li Honglian began to chase him away as she flipped to the next resume.Zhang Ye recalled his Year 3\u2019s basic skills and said, \u201cIs prose okay?\u201d\u201cProse?\u201d Li Honglian was dumbfounded. You still want to do prose? This was even harder than normal modern poems. Furthermore, it was a foreign language\u2019s prose. To Li Honglian, this was on a completely different level of difficulty. She was the only person present who knew Russian. But when she encountered prose, Li Honglian would find it extremely difficult to read it, let alone compose a poem. This Little Zhang sure was good at raising the stakes. \u201cIf you want to choose to do the harder prose, I will not stop you. As long as it\u2019s an original Russian poem, any theme would do.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d After he said that, Zhang Ye closed his eyes and stayed silent. He was adjusting his mood.\u201cAre you done?\u201d\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you beginning?\u201d\u201cForget it. You haven\u2019t even learned Russian. Come again next time for an interview.\u201d\u201cCan you stop wasting our time? There are still others waiting behind you. Go back. Your qualifications are really lacking for a broadcasting host!\u201dAfter not getting a response for a long time, the interviewers became more impatient. They began nagging. None of them believed he could speak Russian. Wasn\u2019t this a joke!?As they spoke with doubt and sarcasm, Zhang Ye sounded out from his diaphragm as his eyes opened. The first sentence he said left all the interviewers present gaping!\u201c\u041f\u0435\u0441\u043d\u044f-\u043e-\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0435\uff0c\u041d\u0430\u0434-\u0441\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0439-\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0439-\u043c\u043e\u0440\u044f-\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440-\u0442\u0443\u0447\u0438-\u0441\u043e\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0430\u0435\u0442\uff0c\u041c\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0443-\u0442\u0443\u0447\u0430\u043c\u0438-\u0438-\u043c\u043e\u0440\u0435\u043c-\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0434\u043e-\u0440\u0435\u0435\u0442-\u0411\u0443\u0440\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a\uff0c\u0447\u0435\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0439-\u043c\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0438\u0438-\u043f\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0431\u043d\u044b\u0439.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d\u201cHe really could speak it?\u201d\u201cWhat language was that?\u201dZhao Guozhou\u2019s eyes glazed over as he looked back at Li Honglian, \u201cOld Li? This is?\u201dThe other interviewers stared back at Director Li. They, too, knew that Director Li knew Russian.But as they looked over, they saw Li Honglian\u2019s eyes staring larger than them. Without a word, everyone knew instantly!What the f**k!You can even speak Russian!?Zhang Ye began speaking faster and faster. In his voice, it was mixed with pride and apathetic emotion. This was because this poem needed to be recited with such emotions!Gorky\u2019s \u201cThe Song of the Stormy Petrel\u201c!This was a Russian poem that everyone in his world knew. It was even in middle school textbooks. This poem was also precisely expressing the emotions Zhang Ye was feeling at the moment. He recited it with glee. The last sentence was especially nearly shouted out by him!\u201c\u041f\u0443\u0441\u0442\u044c-\u0441\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0435\u0435-\u0433\u0440\u044f\u043d\u0435\u0442-\u0431\u0443\u0440\u044f!\u201dThe poem was done!Everyone turned silly!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

How\u2019s the poem?\u201dLi Honglian cleared her throat with a cough, \u201cThat, I\u2026I, too, did not understand it too well. *cough* I only understood a small portion.\u201dAh? Even you, as a person who studied Russian, did not understand it? A few of the interviewers nearly fell off their chairs!\u201cProse poems are like that. Russian is also a bit harder to understand. Besides, Little Zhang said it pretty fast\u2026\u201d Li Honglian came up with an excuse.Zhang Ye immediately said, \u201cThen I\u2019ll translate it into Chinese and recite it once again.\u201dEven after seeing Director Li being taken aback, a young interviewer was still unwilling to give up. He wanted to gain back some reputation for his leader. As Chinese phrases were rich and contained all sorts of variations, it was different from Russian. Chinese was the only way to test a person\u2019s ability. I can\u2019t understand Russian? Then I can definitely make a fuss about the Chinese translation! I won\u2019t let it rest if you misuse a single word! I will fail you! This person still remembered the secret intentions behind his leader\u2019s words. So what if you know Russian? The poem needs to be good, too! You think that you can foolishly pass the test by saying some random Russian phrases? How can it be that easy!?Everyone had different thoughts as they focused fully on the Chinese version of Zhang Ye\u2019s recitation!Zhang Ye could read some of their minds just by looking at their eyes. He knew that they still thought lowly of him. With a sneer, his emotions were perfectly aligned with his recitation. \u201cUp above the sea\u2019s grey flatland, wind is gathering the clouds. In between the sea and clouds proudly soars the Petrel, reminiscent of black lightning. Glancing a wave with his wingtip, like an arrow dashing cloudward, he cries out and the clouds hear his joy in the bird\u2019s cry of courage. In this cry\u2013thirst for the tempest! Wrathful power, flame of passion, certainty of being victorious the clouds hear in that bird\u2019s cry. Seagulls groan before the tempest, \u2013 groan, and race above the sea, and on its bottom they are ready to hide their fear of the storm\u2026\u201dIt was still calm in the beginning!However as the poem reached its climax, Zhang Ye\u2019s tone became more pressing. His volume increased, \u201cThe wind howls . . . the thunder rolls . . . Like a blue flame, flocks of clouds blaze up above the sea\u2019s abyss. The sea catches bolts of lightning drowning them beneath its waters. Just like serpents made of fire, they weave in the water, fading, the reflections of this lightning\u2013Tempest! Soon will strike the tempest! That is the courageous Petrel proudly soaring in the lightning over the sea\u2019s roar of fury; cries of victory the prophet\u2026\u201dWhy do difficulties always befall me?Why is the world always this unfair?But! So what if that was the case! So what if my body was shattered! This is the road I chose! I will not retreat! I have no fear!Zhang Ye took a final breath and said loudly, \u201c\u2013Let the tempest come strike harder!\u201dThe final stanza of the poem was engraved in the hearts of many in Zhang Ye\u2019s previous world. It boiled one\u2019s blood and, now throwing it into this world, it similarly injected itself into one\u2019s blood!Zhao Guozhou turned dumbfounded hearing this!Li Honglian also felt goosebumps!The young interviewer who was thinking of finding fault with Zhang Ye\u2019s poem was now speechless. He did not even dare to breathe!Silence!Seeing everyone stunned by his poem, Zhang Ye felt discharged of his anger. His emotions escaped from the poem, allowing him to recover his calm. This society judged people by their looks and, over time, he had grown accustomed to it. As such, he did not have any scruples as long as he was selected, \u201cTeachers, I have finished answering the second interview question!\u201d\u201cAh\u2026Okay.\u201d Li Honglian\u2019s soul finally returned to her body. Previously, her thoughts had flown into the tempest together with that Petrel.Zhao Guozhou said with a hoarse voice, \u201cWhat\u2019s the name of this poem?\u201dZhang Ye answered, \u201cThis poem\u2019s name is \u2018The Song of the Stormy Petrel\u2019. In Russian, it also has the meaning of a person predicting the storm.\u201d\u201cWhat a good Petrel!\u201d Zhao Guozhou may not understand Russian, but he could understand the Chinese perfectly. \u201cA flying Petrel, a proud Petrel, a fearless Petrel. That is describing you, right? The power of poems is sometimes very miraculous. Young lad, you have given all of us a lesson today!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t dare to take that compliment.\u201d Zhang Ye said.Everyone looked at Zhang Ye in a different light. Previously, reciting a thousand words off-script had shocked them greatly. Now, a casual recitation of a Russian prose poem that was at the level of a grandmaster had completely conquered the hearts of all the people present! His performance had also slapped all the interviewers in the face! Li Honglian had given this question to prevent Zhang Ye from passing the interview. It was clear that she was leading him into a trap, but she never expected him to give a perfect answer. And the answer even included Zhang Ye\u2019s anger and his unwillingness to accept the situation. It made them, as interviewers, ashamed!From which stone did this sort of amazing person jump out from?Li Honglian said with an expression that was hard to read, \u201cThat will be all for today. Go back and wait for the news.\u201dWas he accepted or not? Zhang Ye was not sure either. He only said, \u201cAlright. Thank you, Teachers.\u201dHe walked away and closed the door. Zhao Guozhou, who was all picky with Zhang Ye previously, immediately slammed the table, \u201cMy Literature Channel\u2019s broadcast department wants this person!\u201dLi Honglian disapproved, \u201cOld Zhao, didn\u2019t you say you were eyeing that little Xu?\u201dZhao Guozhou turned indignant, \u201cLittle Xu can be given to anyone, but this person definitely cannot!\u201d\u201cAre you even being reasonable?\u201d Li Honglian began vying for Zhang Ye, \u201cI\u2019m having first dibs on Zhang Ye!\u201d\u201cI was the one who had first dibs! Your foreign channel is not well-matched with him. With his literary prowess, he should definitely come to our Literature Channel. Say no more, Old Li. It\u2019s settled. Whatever good seedlings we have later will all be given to you. I will not vie with you!\u201d Zhao Guozhou said without relenting.\u201cI only want him, not anyone else!\u201d Li Honglian said with a cold face.Zhao Guozhou said, \u201cLast year, I had given up a good seedling to your foreign channel. This year, I\u2019m definitely not giving up. Stop fighting me over this. Later, I\u2019ll give you a treat and, at most, I\u2019ll owe you one!\u201d\u2026\u2026Afternoon.Jiaomen East.After returning from his interview, Zhang Ye did not go to his parents\u2019 place. He still returned to his rental apartment. The small apartment was about 30-40 square meters, but he still liked it here. After all, this was his first time leading an independent life after graduation. He could not rely on parents over every tiny thing. He planned to return home only after he had accomplished something.Lunch was sumptuous. It was fresh prawns and noodles. Of course, it was the Master Kong branded instant noodles.Without money, Zhang Ye could only make ends meet by eating instant noodles. He did not find it tough while working hard towards his ideal goals and, instead, he found joy in it.Suddenly, without any premonition, a person opened the door with the use of a key.Rao Aimin, who was dressed in an autumn dress, entered the apartment, \u201cHow was the interview?\u201dZhang Ye, who was topless, was at a loss about whether to laugh or to cry as he wore a vest. \u201cLandlady auntie, can you please knock first? I have my privacy, too.\u201dRao Aimin sat down with her legs crossed and snapped, \u201cWhat sort of privacy does a little kid like you have? You did not pass the broadcasting host interview, right? I\u2019ve already told you umpteenth times. Just make an honest living by working behind the scenes. With your looks, who would hire you to be in the spotlight? That is, unless they were blind!\u201dIt was quite a coincidence when the phone rang.Zhang Ye picked it up and it was the voice of a youth. \u201cHello, are you Zhang Ye?\u201d\u201cI am, who is this?\u201d Zhang Ye had a hunch, but he still could not believe it.The youth said, \u201cI\u2019m calling from the Beijing Radio Station. You have been accepted and the higher-ups want to inform you to come to the literature channel the day after tomorrow to complete the necessary paperwork. Congratulations.\u201d\u201cYes, Thank you! Thank you!\u201d Putting down his cellphone, Zhang Ye slapped his thigh. Great! He got it!The telephone call\u2019s volume wasn\u2019t soft, so Rao Aimin also heard it. She said surprisingly, \u201cAiyah. Hey? It can\u2019t be? You actually managed to get hired? Every dog has his day. Even a rotten egg can be lucky one day!\u201d Her tongue was indeed very venomous as she said, \u201cEven you can be a host? Hehe, people have said that there are endless possibilities in the future for humans, but I never believed in miracles. However, after seeing you today, I finally believe what the miracle of life means!\u201dMiracle of life, your sister*!Can you not be so disparaging?Zhang Ye was in a good mood, so he did not retort. He immediately picked up the phone and phoned his parents. He informed them of the good news that he was no longer a jobless person. He was to become a broadcasting host!Becoming famous and being a celebrity was what he had always dreamed of. Today, he had finally taken his life\u2019s first step. Although it was a tiny position and he did not have the looks or the height, but now, because of the game ring\u2019s help, his dreams might actually be fulfilled. He remembered the notice displayed in his dream while the game was being installed. This game was to aid him in fulfilling his dreams, to become the greatest superstar in the world. Now, the results were striking. The saving ability he had obtained from the lottery had helped him reverse the situation. The newbie incentive reward that changed the literary background of the world had also played a miraculous role. Today, he could use the imbalanced knowledge of literature to build his fame. By accruing Reputation, he could draw at the lottery, obtaining treasure items to help him fulfill his dreams of being a celebrity!I\u2019m thriving!This bro is going to thrive!Immediately, Zhang Ye felt that even the Earth could not stop him!Becoming famous? House?Girlfriend? That was really a problem!Bungalow? Have you even seen the world!? Can you live in that kind of broken down place? Does it suit the status of a world-famous person? If one wanted to stay, one had to stay in a large mansion! Several tens of thousands of square feet in size!As for a girlfriend? It has to be at least a super beauty like Rao Aimin! A girlfriend? Finding a girlfriend with my qualities? Are you cursing me!? How can I not go out with three to five beauties at once? Wouldn\u2019t it be a loss of face? I need to find at least five! That is just the beginning number!Rolls Royce car? Can you not be so humorous!? Can you really not be so humorous!? If I don\u2019t sit in an armored car when I go out, what happens if I get assassinated? Ah? What to do?Anyways, he would move up to the peak of the entertainment world, step by step. People would remember him. The world would also remember his bright and mighty name, Zhang Jingkong!Eh, that\u2019s not right. You got it wrong!It\u2019s Zhang Ye!*In this novel, you will see a lot of \u2018your sister\u2019, \u2018your granny\u2019, \u2018your grandpa\u2019, etc. \u201cYour abc\u201d was originally a euphemism for \u201cyour mother\u201d or other variations, which is a pretty vulgar curse word in Chinese that\u2019s usually translated as the F word.\u2018Your sister\u2019 is a common phrase used online. It is a derogatory term; but when used against people, it has a humorous take to it. Most people use it without any malice. It is also usually used in conversations as a harmless retort (similar to \u2018screw you\u2019 when used in a joking fashion), and can also magically reduce awkwardness in a conversation. The other variations for different relatives also have similar connotations.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 7": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I\u2019m Really a SuperstarCH 6Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 6: Laundry Day!Sunday.Morning, 7+A.M.Zhang Ye could not sleep from the excitement. He kept tossing and turning in bed, imagining a better future. However, he heard a knock at the door. Only he and the landlady had his rental apartment\u2019s keys. Even his parents did not have it. Without question, it was definitely the landlady inviting herself in.The small room did not have a hall. The bed could be seen the moment that the door was opened.He heard Rao Aimin\u2019s mature voice floating over, \u201cKid, are you sleeping?\u201dZhang Ye touched his nose and rolled over, \u201cI\u2019m awake. Are you looking for me?\u201dRao Aimin sat by the bedside and smiled, \u201cYou have been accepted by the Radio Station and are reporting to work tomorrow. Shouldn\u2019t you be returning the rent you owe to this big sister?\u201d Saying that, she seemed to conjure a magic trick by pulling out a calculator and smacked on it a few times, \u201cThis month\u2019s internet fee is also due. You need to add another 80.\u201dZhang Ye yawned, \u201cWhat are you saying?\u201dRao Aimin repeated, \u201cYou didn\u2019t catch that? I\u2019m telling you that your rent is now a total of 2,662.\u201dZhang Ye, \u201cNo, what was the first line you said?\u201dRao Aimin blinked her eyes, \u201cFirst line? Kid, are you sleeping?\u201dZhang Ye immediately covered his head with a blanket, \u201cI\u2019m sleeping!\u201d\u201cHeh, you damn rascal!\u201d Rao Aimin finally got around and smacked on Zhang Ye\u2019s thigh according to the contours of the blanket, \u201cDo you want a beating? Get up! Stop playing dead in front of me! Wake up quickly! If you can\u2019t pay the rent, then do some housework, like cleaning the place! Return it bit by bit!\u201dZhang Ye shamelessly said, \u201cI\u2019m still sleeping.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll give you half an hour! I\u2019ll be waiting at home at eight!\u201d Rao Aimin said with her face darkened.Encountering a landlady who valued money as if it was her life made Zhang Ye suffer in silence. However, he really did not have any money this month. As such, he could only struggle to crawl out of bed to brush his teeth and wash up.Right, let\u2019s see what the game ring is like now. This was the greatest thing he could rely on in his future bid to become a superstar.When he tapped it open, he realized that his Reputation had increased. Yesterday he had spent 100,000 points for the lottery, leaving behind 99,983 Reputation points. However, it had now increased to 99,999. He did not need to think to know that this was related to his interview. He had been so outstanding and he had even used Gorky\u2019s most famous \u201cThe Song of the Stormy Petrel\u201d. It was no surprise to have his Reputation points increased. Now he was just one Reputation point short of having another attempt at the draw.Reputation is commonly a very general concept. From a game\u2019s perspective, it was a very vague word.Right, now that he had figured out how Reputation points were obtained, he needed to do some household chores for the landlady. He wanted to see if he could add a Reputation point by doing this!Suddenly, a loud voice erupted from the corridor, \u201cLittle Zhang!\u201dZhang Ye realized that it was eight as he quickly wore his slippers and went to the landlady\u2019s house.Commercial and residential apartment buildings had long corridors. This corridor was almost all Rao Aimin\u2019s property. It was quite obvious what having 20+ apartments in Beijing, with extremely expensive property prices, meant. Rao Aimin could be considered a rich woman. But it was strange that despite staying here for so long, along with the other renters, he had never heard of Sister Rao having any relatives or friends. She was not married and was also childless. They had also never seen Sister Rao work at a job, so everyone found this beautiful landlady mysterious. No one knew how she was so rich.Rao Aimin\u2019s house was on the same level. It was the biggest loft apartment on this floor. It was the kind where the upper and lower floors added up to more than a hundred square meters in area.The door opened and Zhang Ye walked straight in. \u201cLandlady, I\u2019m here.\u201dRao Aimin sarcastically quipped, \u201cWas your Chinese Zodiac sign a pig in your previous life?Why are you so slow getting out of bed!?\u201dZhang Ye explained, \u201cI was too happy last night and didn\u2019t sleep all night. I\u2019m still tired now.\u201d\u201cYou just got hired to be a radio host; do you need to make it such a big deal?\u201d Rao Aimin hit him at where it hurt the most, \u201cNow, the radio profession is no longer like what it was 20 years ago. There is the television and there is the internet. How many people still listen to radio?\u201dZhang Ye also knew that the radio profession was a thing of the past as he said sadly, \u201cHai, if only my mom gave birth to me 50 years earlier, then I might be able to grab an opportune time.\u201dRao Aimin sarcastically said, \u201cYour mom is just 50 years old; how is she to give birth to you 50 years early? Do you think your mom is a snake spirit!?\u201dZhang Ye, \u201c\u2026\u201dSee how venomous her mouth is!?Rao Aimin ordered, \u201cCut the crap and get to work!\u201dZhang Ye rolled up his sleeves, \u201cAlright, tell me where to clean. I\u2019ll do all your house chores today.\u201d\u201cWipe the glass, sweep the floor, wash the sheets and I\u2019ll pass my clothes to you.\u201d Rao Aimin poured a cup of tea for herself and sat comfortably on the sofa. Her legs were crossed, making her look like a lord of the land.She was wearing a shirt and long skirt that was not considered stylish. Her feet wore black flats. Although her dressing sense was old, beautiful people looked beautiful no matter what they wore.Hai, time to get working.Zhang Ye began busying himself sweeping and mopping the floor.Rao Aimin was a person whose mouth could not rest. Whenever she was free, she would trample on Zhang Ye by nagging, \u201cWhat kind of wiping are you doing? I\u2019m telling you not to do it haphazardly!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not doing it haphazardly.\u201d\u201cFine, fine. Go wash the clothes!\u201dEntering the bathroom, Zhang Ye sighed as he sat down on a stool. He had thrown everything that could be washed into the washing machine. However, there were some clothes that could bleed their color or were not suitable to be washed with the washing machine, so he had to hand-wash them by soaking them and scrubbing. Piece after piece of clothes, Zhang Ye did not idle one bit for the entire morning.He had no way out. He had lost his human rights by being in debt.Afternoon.Zhang Ye finished his task as he felt extreme pain in his lower back.\u201cAre you done washing?\u201d Rao Aimin glanced at the clothes hanging out in the balcony to dry. It was rare for her to not wag her venomous tongue as she said with satisfaction, \u201cAlright, not bad. That will do. You can stay behind for lunch.\u201d Putting down the ancient book \u201cClassic of Mountains and Seas\u201d, she went into the kitchen to cook.The existence of the \u201cClassic of Mountains and Seas\u201d had been modified by the game. There were things that changed and things that did not change in this world. Zhang Ye could only slowly learn and get used to the details.Zhang Ye was very happy. He had been eating instant noodles for too many days and now he could finally eat a proper hot meal.He sat on a chair to rest. After taking a few breaths, he opened the game ring\u2019s interface. He realized that his Reputation score had increased by one. It was now 100,000 points!This additional point was given to him by the landlady?It looks like his assumptions were correct!The game ring\u2019s explanation of Reputation was, \u201cThe increment of Reputation is related to the player\u2019s fame, exposure, achievement, trust, reputation and other related factors.\u201dThat is to say, if a person were to trust him, admire him or agree with what he did, then his Reputation would increase by one. The Reputation obtained from others could be stacked repeatedly. How did he figure this out?He figured it out from the interview from the previous day. There was a total of eight interviewers, yet Zhang Ye\u2019s Reputation had gone from 99,983 to 99,999. He had 16 Reputation points added. This meant that when Zhang Ye recited the thousand words off script, the eight interviewers had given him a total of eight Reputation points. Later, when Zhang Ye recited the \u201cThe Song of the Stormy Petrel\u201d, they had given him an additional eight Reputation points. The numbers matched up perfectly!After figuring out how Reputation was computed, what was left was drawing at the lottery. He wanted to see what he could get this time!Zhang Ye looked forward to an item that could allow him to turn into Superman. He would be so happy if he could be worshiped by the entire world.However, that was unrealistic upon further thought. Some people could become Spiderman from the toxins injected into their body from a spider\u2019s bite, while there were others who had pieces of iron placed within their body to become Iron Man. Some people became Batman by spending many years with bats.Well, if that had any scientific basis, Zhang Ye felt that\u2026 the chance of him becoming an Instant Noodles Hero was more likely!He drew at the lottery, spending 100,000 Reputation. His remainder was zero!The lottery interface appeared as Zhang Ye deliberately blew at his palms. With a rub of his hands, he pressed on the button that began spinning the wheel!It began!The needle was moving very quickly on the spinning wheel!\u201cSpecial Category! Give me a Special Category!\u201d Zhang Ye muttered to himself. However, from the wheel\u2019s setup, even a fool would know that the Special Category was extremely rare. Although he did not know what it meant by the introduction text, \u201cAdds the purchasing privilege of buying a certain Merchant item\u201d, it was definitely not wrong to hope for a rare item, as that increased its value.However, that one to two percent chance of good luck did not befall Zhang Ye. The needle stopped and it was still pointing towards the largest Consumption Category.Treasure Chest (Small) dropped!As he opened the chest, light blinded him!Inside was something that looked like a stick of chewing gum![Unlucky Sticker]: Effective once it's stuck on. Bad luck will surround the person. Lasts for 5 minutes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He wore a western suit and a tie. He came, once again, to the Beijing Radio Station respectfully and found the Literature Channel department upstairs.The radio station\u2019s coverage was the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area. Some small cities in the northeastern regions could also receive the signal. Although it could not be compared to the Central Radio Station, its coverage and listeners were much greater than other local radio stations that were similarly ranked.The Leader\u2019s office.Zhang Ye knocked on the door gently. After hearing a \u201ccome in\u201d from inside the room, he pushed open the door and entered. Sitting behind the office desk was a person Zhang Ye had met during the interview. He was Zhao Guozhou, who was in his 40s. He was the person in charge of the Literature Channel. Be it the radio station or the television station, this position in Beijing and several areas was called Director. Of course, there were exceptions; for example, Southern and Northern Hunan would call this position Master.\u201cLeader.\u201d\u201cHello, Little Zhang. Sit down. Have you brought all the documents?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve brought them all.\u201d\u201cGreat. Someone from HR will do the hiring procedures for you, but there\u2019s no rush with that. Drink some water and, after that, I\u2019ll first bring you to the office in order to introduce you to everyone.\u201d\u201cOkay, thank you for the trouble.\u201dZhang Ye was very mindful of his speech, even during this simple exchange.After a while, Zhao Guozhou led Zhang Ye with a smile to the Literature Channel department\u2019s office on the same floor. It was a large area and there were about 30-40 desks. As today\u2019s programs might have already been pre-recorded, everyone did not look too busy. Some were playing games, while others chatting.Only when they saw their leader come did they stop playing and chatting.\u201cLeader.\u201d\u201cGood morning, Leader.\u201dEveryone greeted.Zhao Guozhou nodded and slapped Zhang Ye on the shoulder. \u201cEveryone, stop what you are doing. I\u2019m introducing a new comrade. Zhang Ye is a broadcasting major graduate from the Broadcasting College. He will be one of us, from today onwards. Please welcome him.\u201d Although the Media College was its current name, it was previously known as the Beijing Broadcasting College. Its name was changed only in the past few years, so many people still called it by its previous incarnation out of habit. \u201c\u2026There might be some schoolmates of Little Zhang here. You are his senior brothers and senior sisters. Everyone, please take care of this rookie.\u201dThe welcoming applause was sparse. Some people gave an obvious questioning look.Zhang Ye grabbed the opportunity to say hello and gave a brief self-introduction.Following that, Zhao Guozhou called over a youth. He looked to be about the same age as Zhang Ye and could not be much older than Zhang Ye. However, there was no need to compare their looks. He was much more handsome. \u201cTian Bin. Ah, you are radio host. Bring Little Zhang around these days to get him familiar with the business.\u201dTian Bin offered to shake Zhang Ye\u2019s hand, \u201cHello, Little Zhang. You can ask me anything if you have any doubts.\u201dZhang Ye immediately used two hands to receive the handshake, \u201cBrother Tian, I\u2019ll be troubling you in the future.\u201dZhao Guozhou said to Zhang Ye, \u201cLittle Tian is the radio host of our channel\u2019s \u2018Late Night Ghost Stories\u2019. Learning from him would be helpful to you.\u201d Previously, the Literature Channel had ghost stories on the late night channel, but the program name was different. It was probably changed by the game ring.After all the necessary procedures were done, Zhang Ye went to do the paperwork formalities for his hire. After he was done, it was already 10.30 A.M. Only then did he return to his office desk in the corner.A corner desk is usually popular amongst people, as the leader will not be able to see it, allowing one to skive. However, this corner was different. Firstly, it was not far from the entrance and secondly, there was a water fountain here. People came to and fro, which made it a busy spot.As a rookie, Zhang Ye could not do anything. Although his position as a radio host gave him wages higher than the office secretary or editors in the office, he was, after all, a rookie. No special seat would be left for him to choose.Tian Bin was sitting across from him with a board separating them.Zhang Ye looked around, as he had nothing to do. No one had given him any work, so he stood up and asked, \u201cBrother Tian, what do you think I should do or learn?\u201dTian Bin glanced at him, but his expression was clearly no longer the same as the one he had in front of the Leader. He did not care about him and said, \u201cFamiliarize yourself first.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Zhang Ye was not able to ask anything more.At noon in the station\u2019s cafeteria, Zhang Ye took the opportunity to greet his colleagues in the same office, \u201cHello, Sister Wang. I\u2019m new, so please take care of me.\u201dWang Xiaomei\u2019s gaze swept across his face and gave an unfeeling \u201cUh\u201d, before turning away.Zhang Ye had wanted to shake her hand, but now he got himself into an awkward position.Previously, he had gathered from everyone\u2019s conversations that Wang Xiaomei, who was about 30 years old, was one of the starlets of the office. She was the top girl in the Literature Channel. The \u201cTalk About the World\u201d she hosted was the celebrity program that had the highest ratings of their channel. It was a humanities and history program, where the past and present were discussed. Wang Xiaomei was good at hosting and her looks were good.Although she was not as ridiculously beautiful as Rao Aimin, everyone who saw her would evaluate her as a beauty.Only Zhang Ye was not smitten by her, because although Wang Xiaomei looked pretty, she had no characteristics to her beauty. She was lacking in temperament, which made her pale in comparison to his landlady.For an entire day, Zhang Ye tried to build personal ties with people, but it was to no avail. It was as if everyone was not friendly with him. He seemed dispensable.Tian Bin was as such.Wang Xiaomei was as such, too.Only when it was time to knock off did Zhang Ye realize it when he happened to chance upon a conversation between the Literature Channel\u2019s phone editor, Tian Bin, and another beautiful woman.The beautiful woman was most likely Tian Bin\u2019s wife, as the two of them were holding hands. She had probably came to meet her husband after their work hours had ended.\u201cBrother Tian, how did Zhang Ye get hired?\u201d the phone editor asked.Tian Bin curled his mouth and shook his head, \u201cWho knows? Just his looks makes him fail.\u201dThe phone editor sighed, \u201cThat\u2019s right. How can a person with such looks become a radio host? I seriously have no idea what the channel was thinking. I think I could do a better job than him.\u201dTian Bin asserted, \u201cZhang Ye will definitely not be famous.\u201dThe phone editor echoed, \u201cLet\u2019s not even talk about being famous. He might not even be able to get a program. All of our programs in the Literature Channel have permanent hosts. He can, at most, be a replacement host or a guest host to take over for someone who\u2019s sick. Do you think he can have his own program? I don\u2019t even think that will happen next year. Let him endure through it. Heh, if not for the previous replacement host being transferred to the News channel, would he have been hired with his looks? It would not even be his turn to enter the Literature Channel as a host.\u201dTian Bin\u2019s wife laughed, \u201cEven such a person was hired? What a joke.\u201dTian Bin said, \u201cThe leader even got me to lead him around. I don\u2019t have that time.\u201dHis wife said, \u201cThen just ignore him. If he doesn\u2019t have a program, the channel will probably transfer him to another department.\u201dThe three of them walked as they chatted. They were unaware that Zhang Ye, who was by the company entrance, had heard them. Speaking ill of me behind my back?Still want to transfer me away?What sort of people are they!?Clearly, the editor was jealous of Zhang Ye\u2019s good luck. The other radio hosts also did not think Zhang Ye would accomplish much. To them, Zhang Ye a replacement host, who was no different from any ordinary article. As a result, this scene unfolded. No one in the Literature Channel valued him.Who told you I won\u2019t be famous?Who told you that I can\u2019t go on programs?Wait and see. I\u2019ll let you open your eyes!People chased after fame and fortune in their lives. Zhang Ye was not greedy, as he only wanted fame and not money. He would put all of his effort and energy into becoming famous, heading towards his final goal that was set by the game ring\u2019s settings, which was to \u201cbecome the greatest superstar in the world\u201d!Hard work would always pay off. By abandoning all desires and to only strive for fame, he did not believe that he could not make it big!As for other things, like money?Well, what is money? How can it be compared to being famous?He had always treated it like dirt. He really did not care about other worldly things, such as money. He really did not care\u2026Eh, wait!Zhang Ye suddenly stopped at the Western entrance of the station. He had used his foot to step on to something. Seeing that no one was looking at him, he bent down and picked up a dime that someone had dropped on the floor. He surreptitiously stuffed it into his pockets, before he carried on walking.Right, where was I?Oh, right!Who told you that I can\u2019t go on programs?Eh?Who told you that?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 9": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I\u2019m Really a SuperstarCH 8Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 8: Trying the \u201cUnlucky Sticker\u201d!A week passed.That afternoon, Zhang Ye was sitting in his office, eating by himself.His lunch was a bun, a bun and a bun. Finishing three buns was enough to fill his stomach.After a few days of exploration, he was now familiar with his job, the equipment and the interpersonal relations in his department. Zhang Ye learned quite a lot. But of course, all of that was self-learned. Tian Bin, who had been assigned by the Leader to bring him around, had ignored him completely. After getting used to the work environment, Zhang Ye finished whatever was in hands, as he waited for an opportunity. He had not done a single program over the past week. It would even be good if he could be a stand-in host, but all of the eight radio hosts were each healthier than the last. No one got into a car accident or got struck by lightning. Hai.\u201cLittle Zhang.\u201d a person beside him called out.Zhang Ye glanced over and said in a lukewarm fashion, \u201cWhat is the matter?\u201d He still remembered the feelings he had, when he had seen this person for the first time. It was of great shock. There was a moment that Zhang Ye\u2019s mind unconditionally sprouted out a phrase\u4e00aliens have finally invaded Earth!Right, go ahead and think what he looks like!This person\u2019s name was Li Si. It was a very native name. It was ranked alongside Zhang San and Xiaoming as the three most widespread names in the country. The reason why Zhang Ye gave him such an attitude was because the person who had been speaking behind his back with the Tian Bin couple was this phone editor. He had even criticized Zhang Ye for his ugly looks. Just thinking of it made Zhang Ye want to laugh. Shouldn\u2019t you look at yourself in the mirror first? No matter how I look, I am at most average. What about you? No matter what, you can only be described with a poem!You are like the clouds in the sky.You are like the thick haze.You are like the bright moon.You are like the dust in the wind.\u2015Uh, well you just aren\u2019t like a person.Li Si put down a bunch of A4 paper. \u201cBrother Tian will be beginning a new novel on the program tonight. The last novel, \u2018Ghosts at the Zero Point\u2019 has finished recording and broadcasting yesterday. Today, we will begin with \u201cRecalling Spirits\u201d, and we have gotten the copyright for the story last week. The plan is to prepare for 50 episodes. This is the script for the first two episodes.\u201d The phone editor\u2019s job was generally to vet the listeners who call in during a live broadcast. However, nowadays, as it was mostly pre-recorded broadcasts, the phone editor\u2019s job was to do some text editing for some programs. Tian Bin\u2019s \u201cLate-night Ghost Stories\u201d had always been arranged, annotated and audited by Li Si.Zhang Ye said, \u201cWhy are you giving me this?\u201dLi Si looked at him and said, \u201cHelp Brother Tian to edit a few paragraphs. These paragraphs are a little political and the standards for broadcasting and publishing are different, so we need to edit it. Oh, I still need to mark up some words and other jobs. The program tonight will be broadcast live, so there isn\u2019t enough time.\u201dZhang Ye had been assigned by the leader to be led by Tian Bin. Since he could not say no to this task, he took it and edited it.In the afternoon, just before getting off work.Zhang Ye had finished the editing and had also read the first few chapters of the novel. He found it average and very clich\u00e9. According to his understanding, \u201cRecalling Spirits\u201d was a very popular supernatural novel these days. The simplified Chinese edition had been selling like hotcakes; however, when Zhang Ye compared it to the supernatural Tomb Robbers novel in his mind, the difference was great. This world\u2019s supernatural novels were weaker in entertainment value and continuous suspense to the Tomb Robbers novel. When Zhang Ye checked the web to gain some understanding, he realized that this world did not have anything similar to Tomb Robbers. No one had written it and the state of the novel industry was in its beginning stages and was lacking in richness.Suddenly, Tian Bin arrived for work. It was common for those who had night programs. Usually the host who had caught up to the live broadcasts would only come to work in the afternoon or at night.Zhang Ye handed him the prepared scripts, \u201cIt has been edited.\u201d He no longer called him \u201cBrother Tian\u201d, as this fellow was a very vengeful person.\u201cLi Si gave the task to you?\u201d Tian Bin read it once and said, \u201cOh, that will do. These modifications will do.\u201d He did not say any niceties.Li Si arrived at this moment and discussed the script with Tian Bin.Just as Zhang Ye stood up to get off work, the work that he had been eagerly looking forward to for a week came.An assistant from the editor team came looking for Zhang Ye. After seeing him, the middle-aged man quickly stopped him, \u201cLittle Zhang, are you getting off work?\u201dZhang Ye responded, \u201cYeah.\u201dThe deputy said, \u201cHold on a while. I have something here.\u201d\u201cNo worries. Tell me where you need me.\u201d As a rookie, he had to be more hardworking. Zhang Ye knew this deep down.The assistant looked at the documents in his hand, \u201cAt night, besides the broadcast of the first episode of \u201cLate-night Ghost Stories\u201d, there will be another broadcast. It\u2019s the golden time period\u2019s interview program. We have invited a guest, so there is a need for an additional host to help attune the mood. The Literature Channel only has you as a stand-in host. Uh, I\u2019m just not sure if you are up to the task. After all, you have just been here for a week and you might be lacking in experience. It would have been fine if it was a pre-recorded program, which we can fix by re-recording and editing the material. However, we can\u2019t do so for a live broadcast. If any problem happens, it\u2019s an on-air accident, so I need to make sure.\u201dZhang Ye immediately promised, \u201cI have no problems with it. I am already familiar with my work. You can rest assured!\u201d He had been waiting for this!The assistant from the editing team gave a faint \u201coh\u201d and asked Tian Bin beside him, \u201cTeacher Tian, Little Zhang is led by you? Do you think he is up to the task? If you don\u2019t think there will be any problems, then I\u2019ll let him try it out. The people for the program have been rushing me and the broadcast will happen soon, so we are in a hurry to prepare it.\u201dZhang Ye looked at Tian Bin.Zhang Ye was hired to be a broadcast host, so he had to go on a show one day. Now, he had the opportunity and, typically, people would not hinder his future prospects and would say some niceties.However, Tian Bin\u2019s reaction was far from expected. After staying silent for a few seconds, he frowned, \u201cHe has just come and isn\u2019t familiar with the business. Forget it.\u201dForget it?The assistant from the editing team was stunned and acknowledged it tersely.When Zhang Ye heard it, he turned annoyed, \u201cI\u2019m a broadcasting major, and have had practical lessons, so I\u2019m already very familiar. I know how to use all the equipment, too\u2026\u201dTian Bin interjected in a manner as if he was very experienced, \u201cLittle Zhang, I know you are from a specialized major and have good foundations. However, a live broadcast is different. It tests one\u2019s spontaneity. You are still far from that and I\u2019m saying this because I\u2019m responsible for you. You should first slowly gain experience in broadcasting.\u201d With a simple sentence, he had destroyed the chance for Zhang Ye to go on a program. As for the reason, Tian Bin had obviously noticed that Zhang Ye\u2019s attitude towards him had changed. He didn\u2019t even call him \u201cBrother Tian\u201d. Tian Bin sneered in his heart and naturally took the opportunity to suppress him.The assistant from the editor team had no other alternative but to keep the program layout and say, \u201cAlright, then our channel\u2019s Teacher Chen doesn\u2019t have a program today, right? I\u2019ll get Teacher Chen to make the appearance.\u201dWith the opportunity lost, Zhang Ye immediately turned hostile, \u201cTeacher Tian, I have not offended you, right? You did not give me any help on my job to give me experience. You never answered my doubts. Now, you don\u2019t even know what my abilities are and you say I won\u2019t do? You even took away the chance for me to a be a last-minute assistant host? And you spoke behind my back to scheme against me? Did I kill your father or your mother? Is there a need to be this ruthless?\u201dTian Bin did not expect Zhang Ye to dare to speak to him in such a manner and angrily said, \u201cYou repeat that again!\u201dLi Si also rushed forward and said, \u201cAs a rookie, how can you speak to Brother Tian like that? Are you rebelling?\u201dEveryone in the office turned their gazes towards them to watch the commotion. Everyone\u2019s eyes were staring, with no one coming forward to stop them.Tian Bin pointed at Zhang Ye, \u201cThis kid can\u2019t even appreciate my kindness! I\u2019m protecting you by not letting you go on air! It\u2019s to let you build up your experience! And you actually yelled at me? And still said that I schemed against you behind your back? Are you maligning me?\u201dZhang Ye said coldly, \u201cYou know what you said back then with Li Si!\u201dThe two began to quarrel and no one wanted to be in the weaker position. Finally, a few colleagues in the office came forward to stop them. Actually, everyone knew that Tian Bin had the bad habit of speaking behind people\u2019s backs, so they knew that Zhang Ye would not have said this without reason. Furthermore, Zhang Ye was being asked to be a substitute host. Not only did Tian Bin not care bringing the rookie around, he had even made him do all his dirty work. And when the rookie finished the dirty work, you still didn\u2019t let him go on a program? This was indeed quite unreasonable. No matter who it was, they would definitely not be happy about this!Tian Bin and Li Si walked out angrily.Zhang Ye stared at their backs as he scoffed. He knew that people had to tuck one\u2019s tail between one\u2019s legs and behave himself at times; however, when people bullied him, he would not be courteous to them. Tian Bin had pushed it too far! Beat him? Then wait to get fired. Scold him? It was likely that would have the same end result. This was a job Zhang Ye had a hard time getting. He definitely could not lose it. He still needed to use the radio station as the first step to becoming famous!Wait!That Unlucky Sticker!Zhang Ye suddenly thought of the new item he had won at the lottery last week. He did not know how effective the item was and had never planned on using it. Whatever, since we\u2019re in this state, let\u2019s try using it on you! The game ring was what he would rely upon in the future. He had to understand how the items within were used and how effective they were. With his livelihood at risk, how could he not experiment? He really did not know how bad the bad luck would be!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What happened?\u201d\u201cThe rookie nearly fought with Tian Bin.\u201d\u201cAh? Seriously? What happened?\u201dMany people in the office began speaking in whispers. Everyone loved a commotion.Zhang Ye did not go home either. He rubbed the game ring to open his inventory and took out the chewing gum-like object he had previously taken out from a treasure chest. He opened the package. And at this moment, Tian Bin had come back in from outside. As the two of them sat across from each other, their seats were in close proximity to one another. If Tian Bin wanted to get to his seat, he had to pass by Zhang Ye.Zhang Ye quietly stuck the Unlucky Sticker onto Tian Bin\u2019s trousers with a finger. This thing could not be seen by anyone other than Zhang Ye!Pa!Tian Bin had the feeling that Zhang Ye had touched him when he walked past. However, when he looked down, he could see nothing, so he coldly glanced back at Zhang Ye.The game ring made an announcement!The Unlucky Sticker has been used. Effective for 5 minutes. Countdown begins. 4:59, 4:58...Although Zhang Ye\u2019s antics got on Tian Bin\u2019s nerves, his mood today was still good, overall. \u201cRecalling Spirits\u201d was currently the most upward-trending ghost story and he had spent a lot of effort securing the audio &amp; broadcast rights to the novel. A few other provinces\u2019 radio stations had launched a bidding war to secure the rights, but in the end, Tian Bin had won the rights. He had actually resorted to under-the-table methods and had went directly to the publisher, instead of the author, who was a rookie. He negotiated with the publisher\u2019s management and promised a higher price for the rights. As to how the publisher would negotiate the payout with the author, it was none of Tian Bin\u2019s business. He had only promised the publisher that the bid price would not be revealed to the author and that the station and the publisher would be the only ones gaining from this deal.Tian Bin saved no effort, as he wanted to make use of this novel to help boost the listenership of his \u201cLate-night Ghost Stories\u201d segment, attract more sponsorship and gain a name for himself.Beep, beep. Another short message came.Tian Bin looked at his mobile phone. It was a message from the publisher\u2019s vice-president, wishing success to Tian Bin\u2019s radio segment, as well as a reminder to not divulge the fees agreed upon for the novel\u2019s audio &amp; broadcasting rights.Tian Bin smiled and, as he replied while he walked, something happened on the office desk to his left!A female colleague was thinking of taking her lunchbox and getting off work, but when she stretched out her arm, she did not pay attention, causing the lunchbox\u2019s lid to crash to the ground with a \u201cding dang\u201d sound.Tian Bin just happened to step on it and slip to the ground. With a slam, he crashed to the ground!\u201cAiyah!\u201d\u201cAh, Teacher Tian!\u201d\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cSorry, are you alright?\u201dTian Bin was in pain. But as he stood up, he waved his hand, \u201cForget it, forget it.\u201dHe picked up the phone and saw that the message interface was gone, so he created a new message and typed, \u201cPresident Li, please rest assured that we would not be asking about how you split the profits with the author. We will not be revealing our end of the deal with Li Gen either. This is not our first time working together, so you can trust me.\u201d After writing this, Tian Bin scrolled to President Li\u2019s contact to send out the message, but at this moment, the colleague opposite was preparing to knock off from work. When she was passing Tian Bin, she accidentally knocked into him. The silk fan she was holding fell and landed, spread out on the floor.Tian Bin lost his balance, stepped on the fan at the same time and then came crashing onto the ground once again.\u201cBrother Tian!\u201d\u201cI am so sorry!\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u2026 Aiyoo, my back. What\u2019s going on!\u201dThis time, people in the office paid more attention. Two falls in the space of a few seconds?How unlucky could it get?Tian Bin stumbled onto his feet, so angry that he wanted to give a good scolding. He took a look at his phone and realised that while he was falling just now, he had scrolled to the wrong contact, which just so happened to be the author, Li Gen. President Li and him both had the surname of Li. Therefore, their contacts were just beside each other.Tian Bin felt really angry and planned on choosing the correct contact again.But all of a sudden, Li Si walked up from behind at a fast pace, \u201cBrother Tian!\u201dTian Bin turned his head around, \u201cPeng!!\u201dThe fluorescent light above his head exploded without a warning!The light tube\u2019s pieces came falling towards them and gave Li Si a scare. His reflexes caused him to place his hand forward to protect himself, but instead hit Tian Bin on his chin.Tian Bin screamed out, \u201cPutong!\u201dAs he fell backwards onto the ground, his hands tightened and, at the same time, the message was sent!Li Si rushed to help him up, \u201cBrother Tian! Sorry! This\u2026\u201dTian Bin was nearly in tears, \u201cWhat are you doing!? Do you not have eyes!?\u201dLi Si scratched his head and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Brother Tian. I wasn\u2019t aware. Who would have thought that the light would explode?\u201dBut when he picked up the phone to take a look at the screen, Tian Bin\u2019s face changed. Damn it! How did it get sent!?He wanted to save the situation, but it was already too late!This scene played out in front of Zhang Ye. He saw clearly with his eyes how Tian Bin fell and was knocked into. Their colleagues were laughing, thinking, \u201cWhat bad luck Tian Bin has today!\u201dThree times!He had fallen down three times!Didn\u2019t you check the almanac before leaving the house?But this was not the end. Just as the effects of the Unlucky Sticker was ending, the Literature Channel\u2019s person in charge rushed in!\u201cTian Bin.\u201d Zhao Guozhou called loudly.Tian Bin acknowledged, knowing that something was wrong, \u201cLeader.\u201dEveryone looked over, without knowing what had happened.Zhao Guozhou screamed, \u201cWhat the hell are you doing!\u201d\u201cEh?\u201d\u201cThe author of \u201cRecalling Spirits\u201d, Li Gen, just called and demanded that the contract be voided and for us to stop the broadcast of his novel!\u201d\u201cAnd if we infringed upon his copyright, he will send us his lawyer\u2019s letter!\u201d\u201cWasn\u2019t this matter supposed to be handled by you?\u201d\u201cWhy has it become my problem now?\u201dTian Bin didn\u2019t dare to say a word and just looked down.The rights for the novel \u201cRecalling Spirits\u201d were all with the author and the same went for the audio rights. It was down to trust that the author allowed the publisher to negotiate on his behalf. Therefore, strictly speaking, without the author\u2019s written permission, any agreements were not legal. This was how it was for \u201cRecalling Spirits\u201d and Tian Bin had only signed a contract with the publisher. If the author had taken his part of the payment, then the contract would have been in effect. But even so, if the author wanted to, he could have the contract voided!Zhao Guozhou chided him for a full ten minutes.Finally, the Literature Channel\u2019s several managers arrived and everyone was discussing the issue at hand. Only then did Zhang Ye and the others understand what had just happened. It was now known that Tian Bin had an agreement with the publishers of \u201cRecalling Spirits\u201d for the novel\u2019s audio rights. He would keep the agreed price a secret from the author and let the publisher keep a part of the profits. Actually, this was very common in the industry. Even if Tian Bin did not purposefully hide the details, as long as the publisher did not mention it, the author would not have known. But somehow, Tian Bin\u2019s message with all the details of the deal was sent wrongly to the author!Isn\u2019t this a nail in the coffin?Isn\u2019t this disgusting?Cancelling the rights wasn\u2019t too much. If it were any other author who saw that message, the outcome would have been much worse!Tian Bin explained, \u201cLeader, this time it was my mistake, but I feel that we can continue with the broadcast. The contract has already been signed with the publisher, actually\u2026..\u201dWang Xiaomei, who had not knocked off yet, replied with displeasure, \u201cAre you going to fight the court case?\u201dA head of the editorial team also chipped in, \u201cIt definitely cannot be broadcasted!\u201d \u201cWho will be responsible when problems arise?\u201dThey were a public institution and profits were not the main problem; responsibility was.Everyone was discussing back and forth, but finally Zhao Guozhou slammed his hand on the board, \u201cChange the novel. All departments who have suitable ghost story resources, help out. Tonight\u2019s broadcast cannot be cancelled. Use the shortest time and settle the new novel\u2019s copyrights!\u201d Zhao Guozhou pointed at Tian Bin\u2019s nose and said, \u201cIt\u2019s all on you! Wait for your punishment!\u201dIn contrast, Tian Bin looked like his father had just died!While Zhang Ye\u2019s anger simmered, he realized the Unlucky Sticker had only been in effect for five minutes. Just a short five minutes had passed and Tian Bin\u2019s luck became like this? This item is too miraculous! It looks like, in the future, besides the nickname \u201cZhang Jingkong\u201d, another nickname is necessary. Yes, how does \u201cFamous Detective Kogoro Mori\u201d sound!?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Look at what time it is!\u201d\u201cYes. Then, then I\u2019ll try again. I will do my best!\u201dMany people in the office worked overtime. More than ten people hurried about, trying to save the situation. If an idiom was used to describe the situation, it would be \u201call hell broke loose\u201d!\u201cLeader.\u201d Tian Bin asked carefully.Zhao Guozhou waved his hand, \u201cGo to the broadcasting studio and wait there first!\u201dLi Si ran inside the office and said, \u201cThere\u2019s still no way. I have inquired about more than ten supernatural novels. Their audio rights have been sold to other websites or radio stations. I have also contacted the Beihe province\u2019s radio station regarding some of their novels, hoping to broadcast them in a cooperative manner, but they refused. Also, there are some more common horror novels, but due to the tight time schedule, there is no way of contacting them. Some of them don\u2019t even have a way of contacting them.\u201dZhao Guozhou slammed the table, \u201cThere\u2019s not a single book?\u201dLi Si said bitterly, \u201cSupernatural novels are now in short supply. The market is still in its nascent stages and there are only just slightly more than ten books that are mature works. Radio stations from everywhere are snatching them up, too.\u201dAn editor said, \u201cThe worst situation is for us to delay one to two episodes. We can then buy the copyright for them over these two days. Following that, we can resume broadcasting when we have the contract signed.\u201dZhao Guozhou said fiercely, \u201cThis program has been ongoing for five years without a break. If it goes off the air, who will take up the responsibility? Besides, we have advertised the program over the past few days. Three of our channels have been continuously promoting the new novel for today\u2019s \u201cLate-night Ghost Stories\u201d. Who doesn\u2019t know that the most important day of a novel is its first day? Although people do not know what book is to be broadcast, with such widespread publicity, there would at least be four to five times the usual listenership waiting for the broadcast today. Halt the broadcast? Are you going to say it? Today\u2019s program has to be broadcast, regardless of anything. Hurry and try to make contact! I don\u2019t believe that we can\u2019t sign a single supernatural novel!\u201dAs \u201cRecalling Spirits\u201d was the hottest supernatural story today, the station had struck the iron while it was hot by promoting it. They had never expected that this large-scale promotional campaign had turned into a noose around their own necks!Tian Bin said softly, \u201cIf we really can\u2019t make it in time, then\u2026\u201dZhao Guozhou shouted, \u201cEven if you can\u2019t make it in time, you still have to make it! Since this trouble was caused by you, wipe your own ass!\u201dTian Bin did not dare to make a sound as his forehead sweated profusely. He felt oppressed, but he could not release his anger. Who knew that such coincidences would happen? If he had not slipped due to that lunchbox lid, he would not have closed the message window with President Li and he would not have sent the message to the wrong person. If he had not fallen because of a colleague that brushed past him, he would not have chosen the wrong name. If the fluorescent light did not explode and cause Li Si to hit him, he would not have wrongly pressed the send button. Tian Bin had never bungled up so badly in his entire life. However, with all these coincidences happening at the same time, Tian Bin found it very odd! Now with the program on the brink of a major incident, Tian Bin might even be faced with disciplinary action. He did not know how he had offended the Heavens. Why was he being toyed with? Tian Bin looked at Zhang Ye, as if he had seen a ghost. Ever since he had an argument with Zhang Ye, he had been unlucky!\u2026\u2026Midnight.Number five live broadcast studio.This was the Literature Channel\u2019s dedicated broadcast studio that was very well-equipped.Zhang Ye and another staff member entered to test the devices. The staff member checked the headset, while Zhang Ye tested the microphone. There were still ten minutes to go, before the live broadcast entered countdown. Without the novel\u2019s copyrights, there was no way to proceed with the live broadcast. What was there to say? This was not some talk show, where one could talk anything under the sun. This was a ghost story program. People switched on their radios late at night just to listen to this. Without any material, there was no way of going through with it.Across the studio was a transparent glass with a soundproof room on the other side. Typically, that was where the phone editor sat. After finishing his job, Zhang Ye went over. Zhao Guozhou, Tian Bin and company began to enter, one after the other.A female assistant alerted them, \u201cThere are still three minutes remaining.\u201dZhao Guozhou said to Tian Bin, \u201cGo on up!\u201dTian Bin\u2019s intestines had turned green, \u201cLeader. How, how can I go on up? I can\u2019t say anything without a story!\u201dZhao Guozhou, who was also experiencing tremendous amounts of pressure right now, bellowed, \u201cDo you think that I don\u2019t know you can\u2019t say anything without a story!? But what can we do now? Eh! You tell me what I can do!\u201d Pointing towards the studio, he said, \u201cQuickly go in there! The program will be for an hour! I don\u2019t care how you are going to hoodwink it, but just do it!\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no way to hoodwink for an hour.\u201d Tian Bin refused to go on up.His other colleagues looked at each other. Up until now, there was not a single solution!The female assistant looked at the time, \u201cThere\u2019s still another minute. 59 seconds\u202658 seconds\u2026\u201dWang Xiaomei, who was the Literature Channel\u2019s top star and one of the backbones of the channel, had also stayed behind. Seeing that Tian Bin had not moved from his seat, she reprimanded him, \u201cQuickly! If you don\u2019t even go on air for your program, then it will be a broadcasting incident! Think carefully!\u201dA lesser leader of the Literature Channel also said, \u201cGo on up first, before saying anything!\u201dTian Bin still remained motionless. His expression was miserable!The female assistant reported the time quickly, \u201cThere\u2019s still ten seconds\u2026nine seconds\u2026\u201dAt this moment, Zhang Ye suddenly clenched his teeth and made a decision. You can\u2019t do it? You may not be able to do it, but I can! Wasn\u2019t he still gloomy about not being able to have a program? Wasn\u2019t this an opportunity for himself!? No novel\u2019s copyright had been given to them? Zhang Ye still remembered a few tomb raiding stories from his world! Although he did not know if that world\u2019s novels would work in this world, he had to at least try! Taking in a long, deep breath, he primed his expression. His entire aura changed. As the female assistant was counting down the time, Zhang Ye took three steps first and then two steps into the studio. With his ass on the seat, he pushed the button that controlled the audio volume as he wore the headset.Everyone was stunned, with their mouths agape!\u201cLittle Zhang!\u201d\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cWhy did you go on up?\u201dEverybody did not understand what Zhang Ye was doing. Without a single word of a novel\u2019s script, how was he to do a program? Are you going to have a live broadcast just like this? Are you trying to pull something from thin air?Only Tian Bin heaved a sigh of relief and felt lucky.Three seconds. Two seconds. One second. The live broadcast began!With it done, no one could pull Zhang Ye out. The hearts of Zhao Guozhou and many others were now in their throats. How was Zhang Ye, who was a rookie that had just started work a few days ago, going to resolve this situation that had such a huge mishap? Who knows if it would turn out even worse!?Leaving it up to fate, Zhao Guozhou and company gave up!On the other hand, Zhang Ye appeared calm and, in fact, seemed slightly excited. He calmly said, \u201cHello, everyone. This is the \u201cLate-night Ghost Stories\u201d program. I will be your DJ today, Zhang Ye. With the last novel that was highly appreciated coming to an end, we will usher in a new work today, \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019!\u201dGhost Blows Out the Light?What was that?Zhao Guozhou and company were stunned!Zhang Ye adjusted his tone and said with a low, deep voice. \u201cIntroduction. Grave robbing is not like touring, composing poetry, or creating art; we can\u2019t be that elegant, leisurely, adoring or respectful. Grave robbing is a technical skill, a skill for breaking\u2026\u201d Zhang Ye said it neither quickly, nor slowly as he narrated, \u201cAll of these stories began with an incomplete book my father left me. That book is the \u2018Mystic Secret of Feng-Shui, Yin and Yang in Sixteen Characters\u2019. However, no one knows what happened to the last part of the book; the only thing left is the first part. What\u2019s in the book is mainly about the secrets of how to read geomancy and the structure of tombs.\u201d The words and the tone used were very steady.Zhang Ye had chosen this book firstly because \u201cGhost Blows Out the Light\u201d did not exist in this world. Secondly, this book had been really popular. Be it in its sales and or its resounding response, it was number one in Zhang Ye\u2019s world at the time it was published. Ignoring the comparison with other supernatural novels, it had led far ahead, when compared against the most mainstream romantic novels back then. Thirdly, it was because back when he was practicing how to go off script and recite, he had used this book. Thus, he could still faithfully recite the content at the beginning of the novel. Even if there were mistakes or errors in his memory, it would not matter too much, as it did not affect the plot.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was at least much faster than Tian Bin\u2019s speed. This was like how the personalities of people differed. Narrating a chapter also depended upon one\u2019s character. Most of the time, Zhang Ye described the story at a fast to very fast pace. Of course, at important parts of the story, he would slow down when it was required.\u201cFirst chapter. The Funeral Doll. My grandfather is called Hu Guohua and his ancestors were large landowners known far and wide. During their most glorious period, they purchased in the city three alleys that linked together forty houses. They were also involved in some politics and trade, donating provisions and assisting in transportation.\u201dOutside.Everyone did not know what was going on. No one had expected Zhang Ye to take over the job of narrating a ghost story and they were worried. From listening to the first few paragraphs, no one had much anticipation for the story\u2019s content. Was this a supernatural novel? It was too plain. Was this an autobiography? After describing for so long, it was all matters regarding the main character\u2019s grandfather? And grave robbing was mentioned earlier on? Was robbing graves considered supernatural? There had never been such a novel of this type before. To them, only works that had been accepted by the market and had experienced the trial by fire of readers were considered good. However, Zhang Ye\u2019s grave robbing novel was something they had never heard of. As such, they immediately labeled it as something that \u201cwas not up to mark\u201d.However, this view only lasted for ten minutes.When Zhang Ye described how the funeral paper doll made by the craftsman came to life and asked to marry Hu Guohua, Wang Xiaomei felt a shudder. Zhao Guozhou\u2019s gaze turned serious as the entire atmosphere of the studio chilled down!The funeral paper doll had let Hu Guohua dig up her grave for riches. Eventually, when Hu Guohua could not resist the temptation, his liver was eaten by the paper doll. When the plot reached this intense point, everyone\u2019s breathing had also tensed up!Tian Bin was stunned when he heard this. As this was a midnight program, many people working for the channel did not listen to it. Most people would have slept by that time; hence, they would not know much about ghost stories. However, Tian Bin was a DJ who narrated such stories. He dabbled with all these ghostly stories on a daily basis, so he had the ability to distinguish things. Initially, he had deemed it impossible for this grave robbing novel to have any market, as it had never appeared before. But as he listened, Tian Bin felt his pores contract. It was as if Zhang Ye\u2019s mouth emitted a chill. The story had captured Tian Bin immediately!Was this an original work of his?How could this be possible!? He could write such stories?Tian Bin did not believe. Neither could Wang Xiaomei and company believe!Only Zhao Guozhou had a vague idea of the situation. Thinking back to how Zhang Ye composed the poem, \u201cThe Song of the Stormy Petrel\u201d during the interview, Zhang Ye had managed to surprise all of the interviewers. This was a very talented person. Else how could he be granted special permission to be hired with his looks? Zhao Guozhou had grabbed Zhang Ye from Li Honglian\u2019s hands forcefully into his Literature Channel. Now, it seemed like he was prescient.One o\u2019clock in the morning.An hour passed by very quickly.The number of people outside were the same as before. No one, including Zhao Guozhou, had left early. They were all listening to the story.The female assistant gestured to Zhang Ye.Zhang Ye nodded to signal that he got the message and he stopped his story at a suitable spot, \u201cDear listeners. That will be all for today\u2019s broadcast. I welcome you to carry on listening in for the story tomorrow. Thank you, everyone. This is your DJ, Zhang Ye.\u201d Pushing a button to broadcast music, Zhang Ye took off his headset and heaved a sigh of relief. It would have been a lie if he said he was not nervous. He had made some mistakes during the process and nearly embarrassed himself. Thankfully, he had the basic foundations, hence Zhang Ye was still pretty satisfied with his first broadcast. There was still some room for a few flaws.A staff member walked in quickly. What followed was a replay of prime-time programs, so he had to adjust the equipment.Zhang Ye walked towards the room that Zhao Guozhou and company were in. After pushing the door open, he first apologized, \u201cLeader, sorry. I took the initiative to take over the broadcast without discussing with everyone. Mainly it was because there was no time. I did not want the program to have any broadcast incidents and go off-air, too, so I suddenly thought of a plot and idea I previously had. I followed my thoughts and narrated the story. Since it\u2019s my original work, then it would not cause any problems with copyright. I also thought pretty simply, uh, anyways, sorry to everyone. If the higher-ups want to pursue the matter, I will take full responsibility for it!\u201dNo one had any response as they were silent.Zhang Ye blinked his eyes, \u201cLeader, I\u2026\u201dSuddenly, Zhao Guozhou raised his hands and slowly clapped!A middle-aged man in the editing team also raised his hand and clapped vigorously!Following that, a round of applause sounded. It caused quite a commotion in the radio station\u2019s building late at night.Zhao Guozhou grabbed Zhang Ye\u2019s shoulders and smiled, \u201cAre you still apologizing? You have saved this situation at such an opportune time! Without you going on up, we don\u2019t even know what would have happened to the program. Besides, your \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019 was written so well. There\u2019s nothing to say about the quality and neither can I pick on your language. I find it much better than the supernatural novels that our station has to pay top dollar for. Great, I knew I did not make a mistake choosing you!\u201dZhang Ye immediately said, \u201cThank you. I\u2019m flattered.\u201dThe female assistant also grinned, revealing her canines, as she secretly gave Zhang Ye a thumbs-up.Li Si\u2019s eyebrows were knitted tightly. Tian Bin was also not in a good mood as he stared coldly at Zhang Ye.Zhao Guozhou clapped his hands to attract everyone\u2019s attention. \u201cAlright, everyone has been busy all night. You have all worked hard today, so go home and take a rest.\u201d Again, he spoke to Zhang Ye, \u201cLittle Zhang, do you still have a follow-up to this story? Tomorrow you can just carry on narrating it. \u2018Late-night Ghost Stories\u2019 will temporarily be hosted by you!\u201dMe?This program was temporarily mine?There was no need to mention Zhang Ye\u2019s pleasant surprise. He was, of course, overjoyed. He had just started work for a week and was a rookie amongst rookies. Without any experience, he was given a program that he could call his own? He had seized the opportunity at the most opportune time as he immediately said, \u201cThank you for the Leader\u2019s trust. I will definitely do well!\u201dTian Bin could not accept hearing this, \u201cLeader, letting him host? Then, what about me\u2026\u201dZhao Guozhou said impatiently, \u201cWhat about you! You didn\u2019t even dare to sit on the seat during the last few seconds! If not for Little Zhang rescuing the situation, we would have a live broadcast incident! You shall be a stand-in host for now! And take some time to reflect!\u201d After covering his mouth to yawn a few times, he walked out tiredly.\u201cLeader!\u201d Tian Bin shouted.Zhao Guozhou went home without even looking back.Wang Xiaomei stared deeply at Zhang Ye, before returning.Zhang Ye glanced and said to Tian Bin, \u201cTeacher Tian, I\u2019m sorry. I will consult you if there is anything I do not know in the future.\u201d He did not kick Tian Bin while he was down and did not turn arrogant upon being successful. He calmly said some pleasantries. Zhang Ye was pretty impressed with his own bearing. Look at me being so refined!Tian Bin was so angry that his eyebrows were tightly knitted!Earlier that day, Tian Bin had been all-powerful and had repressed the rookie, Zhang Ye, due to his qualifications. In a few hours, his program had been taken over by Zhang Ye! With winners crowned and losers vilified, it could be said that nothing could be taken for granted in this world! Tian Bin bit his molars as he believed that it was still to be determined as to who had the last laugh. The most important thing was to see the listenership ratings when they were released tomorrow. If the first day\u2019s rating was still at the bottom, even after all the promotions, then Zhang Ye might be kicked away even if he did not make a mistake. After facing disciplinary action, the program would still be Tian Bin\u2019s!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He heard two men, who had just got on the train, speaking nearby. The topic of conversation made Zhang Ye\u2019s ears perk up.\u201cOld Zhao, did you listen to \u2018Late-night Ghost Stories\u2019 last night?\u201d\u201cOf course, I did. I listen to that program every night without fail. Eh, I thought you didn\u2019t listen to the radio?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t listen to it, but my wife does. Yesterday, she forcefully made me accompany her and had me listen to the program. You should know my wife, right? She has so much courage. If she sees a gangster late at night on the street, just her voice will scare the gangster away. She listens to ghost stories just so she can sleep. She had never felt so afraid before. And strangely, yesterday, they had broadcast a new \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019, which scared her so much that she woke me up. I told her not to listen to it if it\u2019s so scary and just switch it off, but she refused and was adamant about tuning in.\u201d\u201cHaha, yesterday\u2019s \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019 was awesome. Although I was not fear-stricken, I did find it creepy deep down inside and could not sleep well. It was very good.\u201d\u201cI also accompanied my wife and listened till 1 A.M. It was indeed good.\u201d\u201cI will carry on tuning in today. I really want to know what happens in the tomb later.\u201d\u201cThat host is a rookie, right? His name is Zhang Ye? I find his narration very good. His speed was very appropriate, as the host from before spoke too slowly.As the two people continued to chat, they did not know that the Zhang Ye they were discussing was just a few meters away from them.Zhang Ye felt good hearing that. This feeling was so good. Opening his game screen to look at his Reputation, it was now at 10,677.Having bought the second \u2018lottery\u2019 ticket yesterday, his Reputation had been depleted all the way down to zero. His Reputation had grown by more than 10,000 in a night. One had to know that ever since Zhang Ye was born, he had only managed to gain 200,000 Reputation in his more than 20 years of living. Now, with just a night\u2019s time, he had nearly matched what he had previously gained in a year. This speed was indeed very fast. There was indeed no mistake in choosing a radio station as his first step towards becoming famous. Besides, his Reputation would slowly increase. It would increase by one or two sporadically. It was the standard practice that every episode of \u201cLate-night Ghost Stories\u201d would be edited by specialized staff before they placed the recording on the radio station\u2019s website. Clearly, the gradual increase in Reputation was from people who did not listen to the live broadcast the previous night and were instead from people who listened to the sound bite on the website and gave Reputation points to Zhang Ye if they found it good.Getting off the subway and onto the platform.Zhang Ye first went to a roadside store to buy cigarettes. His addiction was not too bad, as he would smoke two sticks whenever he encountered a good situation.\u201cWhat cigarettes do you want?\u201d the boss asked.Still Red River? This was the cigarette brand that Zhang Ye usually smoked. However, realizing that he was now at least a celebrity, smoking a 6 CNY cigarette did not match his status as a successful radio host and a would-be famous world celebrity. Smoking a 6 CNY cigarette would be too embarrassing. A celebrity had to appear like a celebrity. They had to display their financial ability and their social image at every moment.As such, Zhang Ye waved his hand, \u201cGive me a pack of Double Red Joy!\u201d\u2026Alright, this pack is 6.50 CNY.\u2026\u2026Reaching the office.There were many colleagues who had dark circles under their eyes, as they had worked overtime until very late yesterday.Zhang Ye entered and was already accustomed to being ignored by everyone. He was preparing to take his seat to begin working. Now that he had his own program, it could be considered a promotion, so he naturally had a lot more things to do.\u201cLittle Zhang, you\u2019ve come?\u201d\u201cGood morning, Teacher Zhang.\u201d\u201cI heard the program. It was awesome.\u201d\u201cRight, I could not come back yesterday, as I had something going on. I also listened back at home. I heard that it is an original work of yours? And without a script? Speaking whatever you thought on the spot? Amazing!\u201d\u201cNo ordinary person can go on a live broadcast without a script.\u201d\u201cTeacher Zhang is from a specialized major, so this is nothing.\u201dA few colleagues smiled and greeted Zhang Ye. Their attitude was very friendly.Zhang Ye did not make a timely reaction. Teacher Zhang? What Teacher Zhang? Are they\u2026calling me that? Realizing this, Zhang Ye quickly turned humble, \u201cTeacher Qian, Teacher Wu, Brother Wu, please don\u2019t call me teacher. I\u2019m still new and am just a student. I still need to learn a lot from all you seniors. Just calling me Little Zhang would do.\u201d As a person working in the media industry and someone facing the public, \u201cTeacher\u201d was a form of \u201csalutation\u201d. It was not too much, but Zhang Ye knew his boundaries. With his present qualifications, other people may respect him by calling him teacher, but he could not accept it.By exchanging pleasantries, this was the first time Zhang Ye actually had a deep exchange with his colleagues.The reason was clear. Previously, people ignored Zhang Ye because he was just a stand-in DJ. He did not have the looks, so no one thought he could make it big; hence, no one bothered to build a relationship with him. But now, things were different. Tian Bin had made a mistake and Zhang Ye had saved the situation at the last minute, preventing a broadcast incident. His story was also very good and he was temporarily made the host of the program. He had went from being a substitute to a main host, so the attitude of his colleagues naturally had a subtle change.Was this how the world worked?The way humans reacted was normal, so Zhang Ye did not make a fuss about it.Of course, there were still many in the office who pretended Zhang Ye did not exist. This was in the character of some of them, while there were others whose work had nothing to do with Zhang Ye. Although everyone shared an office, they all had different responsibilities. A portion of them even had good relations with Tian Bin.Behind him, a female clerk walked over with a cardboard box in her hands. Inside, there were stacks of bound letters. After passing some letters to a few program hosts, she came by to the corner and was about to put the letters on Tian Bin\u2019s table through habit, but after thinking it over and seeing that Tian Bin was not around, she glanced at Zhang Ye and passed them to him. \u201cTeacher Zhang, these are letters from the listeners of \u2018Late-night Ghost Stories\u2019. Some of the letters are for Teacher Tian. As the postal service was slow, some of them were received only today. Some of them are yours. They were mailed out by the listeners early this morning.\u201dZhang Ye said, \u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d The female clerk walked away.Zhang Ye breathed in as he opened the letters. It was like the experience of a newly-wedded bride.The first letter was written by a child. His words were crooked and very innocent, \u201cHello, Teacher Zhang. The story you narrated is so good. My mother had wanted me to go to sleep early and even beat me up, but I still did not switch off the radio and listened to it secretly under the blanket. I will listen to \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019 from now on, daily!\u201dZhang Ye smiled and, with some thought, he picked a pen and wrote, \u201cI am Zhang Ye. Thank you for your letter. You should sleep early and listen to your mother. Don\u2019t stay up late at night. \u2018Late-night Ghost Stories\u2019 is uploaded on the Literature Channel\u2019s website, so you can listen to the broadcast online.\u201d After he finished writing, he found the female clerk and received her help in sending his response to the young listener, according to the sender\u2019s address. After returning to his seat, he carried on reading his letters.Second letter: \u201cToday\u2019s story is better than all the trash ghost stories from before by 10,000 times. This is the supernatural novel that resides in my heart!\u201dThird letter: \u201cI am a taxi driver who works the night shift. \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019 is an awesome story. I will continue supporting it!\u201dFourth letter: \u201cThis is the best supernatural novel I have ever heard! I just want to say thank you to the program team! Thank you, Teacher Zhang! I finally do not find the nights boring!\u201dThere were more than ten letters and Zhang Ye read each and every one of them. He picked out three letters to respond to.He then switched on his computer, so that he could read the letters in his e-mail inbox. Ever since taking over \u201cLate-night Ghost Stories\u201d, someone had given him the password to the program\u2019s inbox. After logging in, he realized that there were more than 80 unread e-mails. This mail was not written as formally as the hand-written letters he had received. There was more online slang.Liuliu59: \u201c\u2019Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019 is too cool!\u201dEdhska115: \u201cGreat, Great, Great, Great!\u201dQqqry: \u201cTeacher Zhang, say a bit more each day. I strongly request for the program to be extended. I have already recommended \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019 to many of my classmates and friends. I will be calling all of them up at night to ask them to tune in. Hehe, I\u2019ll give you a \u2018like\u2019 and be your fan in the future!\u201dSo many good comments?Zhang Ye found it to be extremely beautiful!Look at this. Look at this. This is the voice of the people!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But in an institution like this, the rules were more lax than in the private sector.After Tian Bin arrived, the atmosphere became a little awkward.Everyone\u2019s attention was focused on both Tian Bin and Zhang Ye.As victors were always more gentlemanly, Zhang Ye made his greeting, as if nothing had happened, \u201cTeacher Tian, good morning.\u201d It was as though they had not quarreled the day before.Tian Bin ignored him, thinking begrudgingly, \u201cThat Zhang! Don\u2019t get too cocky. That \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019 might not get you anywhere. Grave robbing? This was something illegal. These two words are already not positive and you are finished if the listeners do not accept it. When the ratings reach a new low, it will be time to get off your high horse. You won\u2019t be jumping around for much longer. The listenership ratings will be announced soon. Wait and see!\u201dTian Bin was waiting for the listenership ratings.Zhang Ye was waiting for them, too. He, too, didn\u2019t really know how accepting the listeners were. Although he had received a lot of letters of praise, there were still some critics, some of which were quite harsh. Although this was just a small sample of the audience, what the actual results were still depended upon the whole listener base.The door outside opened and Zhao Guozhou walked in with his pot belly as he came for his inspection. He passed on some instructions to his old comrades and spoke with an editor, before setting his eyes on Zhang Ye with a little laugh, \u201cLittle Zhang. Uh, yesterday\u2019s performance wasn\u2019t too bad. Whether the rating is\u00a0good or bad, your story was just too timely.\u201d Speaking of this, he spoke to someone, \u201cOh, right. Are the ratings for yesterday out? Why didn\u2019t anyone give it to me?\u201dWang Xiaomei raised her head, \u201cI just came from upstairs. They are still at it, but it should be ready soon.\u201dSuddenly, the female assistant, Xiaofang, who helped Zhang Ye the night before, briskly walked in with a form. The moment she stepped in, she took a quick look at Zhang Ye and handed the form to Zhao Guozhou, \u201cLeader, the ratings have been released. These are\u00a0the overall statistics for yesterday!\u201dZhao Guozhou acknowledged it and took a look, but he couldn\u2019t help but be taken aback, \u201cDid you take the correct one?\u201dXiaofang, with a wry smile, said, \u201cOf course, I did. The statistics department directly handed it to me.\u201d While saying that, her eyes drifted over to Zhang Ye\u2019s direction again.The leader\u2019s comment could not help but stir up everyone\u2019s curiosity. Well? Was there anything wrong with the ratings?\u201cEveryone, stop your work for a bit. I will be announcing the rankings.\u201d This was a daily affair of the Literature Channel. Zhao Guozhou would, almost without fail, announce daily the rankings for the previous day, so as to apply pressure on everyone. The top-ranked star segments with high listenership had high advertising fees and high bonuses. Segments that ranked at the bottom faced the risk of being cut, like Tian Bin\u2019s hosted segment \u201cLate-night Ghost Stories\u201d\u2019 previous novel, \u201cGhosts of Midnight\u201d. There were many parts in the middle which had been edited out and the ending was directly broadcasted. All in all, a total of over 10 episodes were removed due to the lack of listeners.There was no choice.The station always replayed the day\u2019s programs after 1 A.M., meaning that \u201cLate-night Ghost Stories\u201d was the last program of the day. Listener numbers were already limited due to this reason. How many people would want to listen to the radio this late at night? Segments that appeared very late at night, like this one, would never have a chance to be compared with the segments that were broadcasted between the golden hours of 7 and 8 P.M. The amount of people listening in could even reach a result that had a difference of ten times. Including the weekend, the Literature Channel had slightly over 20 segments in total. \u201cLate-night Ghost Stories\u201d was always ranked at around 20th place, which meant it was either first or second if you were to count from the back. Even a lightning strike wouldn\u2019t be able to move it. It was not that the segment was bad. They had the most loyal listeners amongst all of the Literature Channel\u2019s segments. It all boiled down to the extremely limited audience base and late night timing, so how could it ever fight for a place among the top spots? It would definitely be an international joke!Zhang Ye eagerly looked on with hope, but without any ambition. As long as it was not in last place, he would be fine with the result.Zhao Guozhou announced, \u201cFirst place, \u201cTalk About the World.\u201dThis was Wang Xiaomei\u2019s segment. She and her team were not surprised. Several years had passed with Wang Xiaomei\u2019s segment always being ranked at the top, without losing its place even once. Not only at their own station\u2019s Literature Channel, the amount of ratings received was one of the highest amongst the Beijing Radio Station\u2019s radio channels. It had a prime-time slot and a pretty female host, so other than the traffic and news channels, her segment had always outdone all the other segments.\u201cSecond place.\u201d Zhao Guozhou read from the list, \u201cEntertainment Daily.\u201dThe Literature Channel, which included the entertainment circle\u2019s news, could not be compared with the News channel in terms of its audience base. But they had their own fixed audience base, as well. This segment was also a standard fixture for second place.It was time to reveal the third place.But Zhao Guozhou held back for a long while, like he was reading off the ratings graph.\u201cOld Zhao?\u201d one of the managers who was close to him said suspiciously.Zhao Guozhou remained in his paused state for a short moment before announcing, \u201cThird place\u2026\u2026.\u201d Stretching his tone, he finally said, \u201cThe third place goes to\u2026.. \u2018Late-night Ghost Stories\u2019!\u201dWhat?\u201cLate-night Ghost Stories\u201d placed third?Upon hearing this, Tian Bin freaked out from the inside! He was still wondering if Zhang Ye could carry on the tradition of being in the last place, but somehow the results were as such! Were the statistics compiled incorrectly? That must be it: a compilation error! He knew his segment the best of anyone here. Tian Bin was wondering, \u201cHow could this unpopular program , which was on its deathbed, achieve such a high listenership?\u201dLi Si was staring out of his gaping wide eyes!Zhang Ye did not expect such a result either and was shocked by it!Not to mention anyone else, the whole office was temporarily in shock. No one could believe their own ears!\u201cLate-night Ghost Stories\u201d placed third? This is not a joke, right? This segment was always ranked last or the second to last in the Literature Channel! Alright, as this was the first broadcast for a new story and the promotions were more than ever before, logically, the listenership would increase a lot. This was because listeners would always be curious and a new story would always attract them to find out what story would be broadcast. If it was any good, they would continue listening in; otherwise, they wouldn\u2019t. Thereafter, the listeners would dwindle in number before settling on a steady number. But even if a new story could increase the ratings, this was too much of an exaggeration!Straight to third place?Even doing better than the 5 P.M. and 9 P.M. segments?Doesn\u2019t this mean that all the listeners pulled in by the promotions never turned off or changed channels once they heard the beginning of \u201cLate-night Ghost Stories\u201d? Almost all of them were retained by this story? That reason allowed the ratings\u2019 average to be pulled up by so much?Even Wang Xiaomei, who was the host with the best ratings, reacted to this. Even her segment could not retain all of its listeners. Who doesn\u2019t switch channels if they found the program boring? That\u2019s why, even when the listenership rating was high at the beginning of the segment, it would slowly decrease towards the last half hour of the segment and, as such, the average rating would go down by at least half!But what\u2019s with \u201cLate-night Ghost Stories\u201d?The average listenership was too scary!Instantaneously, everyone looked at Zhang Ye differently. A rookie who had just arrived, a novel \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019 that no one had ever heard of \u2013 these led to the late night segment securing third place in the ratings? Holy ****! You must be on drugs!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He praised, \u201cI would like to now commend the team for \u2018Late-night Ghost Stories\u2019, especially Little Zhang. For a late night segment to achieve a placing in the top three for its first broadcast, it is unprecedented and should be entered into the record books. I\u2019ve seen the listenership ratings graph and there isn\u2019t much of a difference between the upper and lower ratings throughout the program. Starting from midnight, it was always on a high and this shows the affirmation the listeners have about the plot. And because of the explosion of \u2018Late-night Ghost Stories\u2019, this channel\u2019s overall\u00a0rating also rose. Let\u2019s have a round of applause for Little Zhang and wish that he would keep working harder!\u201dBba Bba Bba.Everyone reacted with applause.But Tian Bin did not move; he couldn\u2019t accept the truth!Zhang Ye clasped his hands in appreciation, \u201cIt\u2019s all thanks to the Leader\u2019s help and everyone\u2019s support; it wasn\u2019t down to me alone.\u201d\u201cTalk About the World\u201d listenership 3.17%.\u201cEntertainment Daily\u201d listenership 2.29%.\u201cLate-night Ghost Stories\u201d listenership 0.98%.\u201cLaughter Daily\u201d listenership 0.92%.\u201cPeople\u2019s Broadcast Station News Highlights (Affiliate Broadcast)\u201d listenership 0.89%.Sixth place.\u2026Seventh place\u2026\u2026the ratings had very little difference.This time, the segment in last place was \u201cOld and Young Story Club\u201d, taking over the last place position of \u201cLate-night Ghost Stories\u201d, with a listenership of 0.27%.After Zhao Guozhou finished announcing, he summarised the previous day\u2019s results before letting everyone return to their work.Zhang Ye sat back down and got himself busy. On the surface, he was calm. But inside, he was bursting with excitement. If no one was around, he would have smiled until his mouth went crooked. Only after it sunk in did he calm down and analyze the reasons for the program\u2019s popularity. The most important reason should have been because of market and environmental factors. The ghost stories and supernatural novels of this world was still in their infancy stages, so not many good works have appeared, yet. The ones that could be considered good numbered around 4 or 5 novels. In Zhang Ye\u2019s view, these top novels would only be considered to be so-so; therefore, the market still hungered for more. Now, Zhang Ye had brought to them a story full of novelty about grave robbing, a story that was already tested and well-received in his world. The key was that this story was being first released on radio. It was an original story that was not available anywhere else in the market and so it was not in anyone\u2019s imagination that it would achieve such great results.That afternoon, the recording schedule was confirmed.The female assistant, Xiaofang, came looking for Zhang Ye while holding a slip, smiling sweetly, \u201cTeacher Zhang, it\u2019s time to do the recording for tonight\u2019s program. You have Room 7 from 10 A.M. to 11:30 A.M. Don\u2019t go any later than 11:40 A.M., because there is another recording after that. Well, in the afternoon, Room 8 has a lot of free slots. If you are up for it, I will book the timings for you? We can book three hours at the most.\u201dZhang Ye considered this, \u201cOkay, then thanks for the trouble. Book it for however long it is available for. I will try to record three broadcasts by today.\u201d Of course, it would be good to prepare a few broadcasts in advance while in good health and spirits, rather than to rush at a later time. Besides, in this line of work, having one\u2019s voice in a good condition was imperative. If he caught a cold, it would definitely affect the quality of the broadcast, so it was better to be prepared.\u201cSure.\u201d Xiaofang blinked, \u201cThen, should I help to prepare your manuscripts?\u201dZhang Ye waved his hands, saying, \u201cNo need for that. I don\u2019t have any manuscripts. Let\u2019s go straight to recording.\u201dNo manuscripts? Xiaofang couldn\u2019t help but look at him admiringly. Even the colleagues around who heard that were impressed. Ignoring the composition skills of the newly-arrived Teacher Zhang, just his off script reading skill was one of a kind in the Beijing Radio Station. Even for programs that demanded spontaneity like interviews, the host would still require a script of some sort for a guide, not to mention a program like story-telling!Tian Bin watched with envious fury. Look how everyone is behaving. It\u2019s just a good result for the first broadcast and that\u2019s to be expected. I don\u2019t believe that the next few broadcasts will bring such high ratings. The station had been promoting it so strongly, so, of course, the first broadcast would be highly-rated. Tian Bin also had a broadcast for a novel last year and on the first day of the broadcast, he had received ninth place. But the next few broadcasts\u2019 ratings dropped exponentially by the day. In the end, it became last place as usual. Such is the law of programs in the late night segment and no one has ever managed to escape the claws of this curse!Wait and see what happens tomorrow and the day after! I will watch you cry when that happens!Tian Bin was already confident of his judgement!Other Literature Channel colleagues, even Zhao Guozhou, had similar thoughts. Luck probably played a part for its first broadcast rating. No matter what, this was a late night segment: a midnight segment, in fact. This timing had the lowest audience numbers, so the ability to take third place would be lost for sure. It would even be normal for it to slip to around the tenth place.However, the way the situation progressed caught everyone by surprise!There was a slight dip in the listenership for the second episode of \u201cGhost Blows Out the Light\u201d. After all, even the best things would not be well-liked by everyone. If there were people who liked it, there would be people who disliked it. It could not be forced. After listeners who contributed to the first episode\u2019s listenership rating left, the results dropped to the segment to sixth place for the entire channel. However, immediately following the third episode of \u201cGhost Blows Out the Light\u201d, it ushered in another explosive breakthrough. It returned, once again, back to the third spot in the entire channel. Very clearly, although a small fraction of listeners had left, a large group of listeners gradually came in to replace them!Zhang Ye\u2019s deep voice flowed from the radio, \u201cThousands of pieces of timber were used to build up a pyramidal tower that stood above-ground. There were red sparkling stars above the tower and, using the weak light to see, the foundation of the wooden tower was about two hundred meters wide, made of cement. Thousand-year-old cedar wood was used to build the tower\u2019s body and it had a total of nine floors. Each floor was filled with dried skeletons, wearing all sorts of strange ancient costumes. There were people of all ages and genders. Each piece of wood was engraved with Tibetan runes. Is this a tomb? Who could have built a tomb of this size underground?\u201dMany listeners in the city of Beijing felt an eerie chill while listening nearby their radios!Zhang Ye was listening to his own program at home, too, while checking the internet for messages and comments, enjoying it thoroughly.\u201cI\u2019m finished! I won\u2019t be able to sleep, again, tonight!\u201d\u201cMe, too. This part is too exciting!\u201d\u201cCan you not leave us with a cliffhanger? Why did it end here today?\u201d\u201cStrongly requesting for a bit more! I will not be able to sleep at ease!\u201dThe listeners\u2019 feedback was very positive. The posters included the old, the young, both males and females. It covered almost all ages!About ten minutes after the program ended, Zhang Ye noticed on his Weibo a bigwig account\u2019s comment. The verified account belonged to a famous Central TV producer, Hu Fei, who had a following of over 600,000 fans. He posted, \u201cYesterday, a director from the station recommended to me a late-night radio program called \u2018Late-night Ghost Stories\u2019, telling me that the novel being read was really awesome. At first, I didn\u2019t quite believe it and, with a skeptical attitude, I listened to five episode broadcasts. But in the end, I was really impressed. I felt pleased, as I have read many supernatural novels, but none of those had amazed me this much. The country needs more of such great works.\u201dBelow the post, many fans rushed to re-publish it.\u201c\u2018Late-night Ghost Stories\u2019? Never heard of it. Is it that good?\u201d\u201cIf Teacher Hu says he is impressed, then it must be pretty good!\u201d\u201cHaha, even Teacher Hu is recommending it? Looks like everyone\u2019s aesthetic style is the same. I began listening to \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019 from the first episode and cannot help myself!\u201dSeeing this, Zhang Ye felt good. This was the greatest affirmation he could receive!\u2026The next day.\u201cLate-night Ghost Stories\u201d\u2019s ratings for the past few days had been released!First episode: 0.98%Second episode: 0.69%Third episode: 1.01%Fourth episode: 1.14%Fifth episode: 1.27%After nearly a week of broadcasts, even though Zhang Ye\u2019s program was still in the top three, it was still a far cry from the second-placed \u201cEntertainment Daily\u201d. It was not likely to take second place any time soon, but it had already firmly rooted itself at third place, since it was comfortably above the fourth placing. Moreover, the rating was increasing ever so slightly by the day, meaning that there was still a lot of potential for improvement!Upon the release of the rating results, many skeptics were shut down, including Tian Bin.A miracle had been created! The success of \u201cLate-night Ghost Stories\u201d made it unbearable for many to lay their sights on it!Colleagues expressed wonder and admiration. As an unexpected competitor, the rise of this late-night segment was too sudden!Even the traffic, music and news channels knew of Zhang Ye! That\u2019s how it was in the station; what secret could remain a secret?\u201cHey, Ah Li.\u201d\u201cOld Meng? What\u2019s up?\u201d\u201cI heard an awesome person came to your Literature Channel? He pushed the late-night program\u2019s listenership rating to third place? It is catching up with the ratings of prime-time programs? Is that true?\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s true.\u201d\u201cAwesome, too awesome.\u201d\u201cYou have not heard \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019, yet, right? If you listen to it, you will not be surprised. It\u2019s a really good piece of work. And it has opened up the tomb robbing genre for supernatural novels. It is the founder! You may not know this, but for the past few days, the amount of letters sent in by listeners everyday is just crazy. There would be at least a hundred letters a day!\u201d\u201cReally? Then I must really give it a listen!\u201dZhang Ye was passing by, when he heard the discussion between the two. With a slight tinge of happiness, he understood now that he has firmed up his standing in the station. \u201cLate-night Ghost Stories\u201d had become a star program of the Literature Channel and by continuing to contribute to the listenership, Zhang Ye\u2019s place as a radio host will rise, too!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Since the Saturday and Sunday segments were pre-recorded already and left to the female assistant, Xiaofang, to broadcast, Zhang Ye could afford to stay home and be lazy. He woke up past 10 A.M. and stretched his body, before getting out of bed. The first thing he did was to bring up the virtual game screen to check on his achievements for these past five days. His Reputation points were at 110,000. Other than the first broadcast, which grew his Reputation slightly by just over 10,000, and the second broadcast, which added slightly less points, the remaining broadcasts, in total, added over 20,000 Reputation points a day. Seeing his Reputation grow so rapidly, Zhang Ye couldn\u2019t be more pleased.There were enough points to draw at the lottery once again.Without any hesitation, Zhang Ye spent 100,000 Reputation points to open up the lottery, \u201cThis time, I\u2019m not wishing for a Special Category. Giving me a Skills or Stats Category would do. I\u2019ve already played it twice, but have still not seen what is in the other categories!\u201dTapping on it!The needle began moving!Stats Category\u2026Special Category\u2026Skills Category\u2026The needle slowed down and constantly moved past many other regions. Just as it was about to stop on the Skills Category, a slight jerk made it move forward. It did not hold!Missed by just a bit!Fine, it\u2019s still a Consumption Category!Zhang Ye accepted it as he opened the lid of the Treasure Chest (Small). Inside the chest was a clear bottle with a small wood stopper!\"Invisibility Potion\": Stealth mode activates after drinking it. Lasts 5 minutes.Seeing the game ring\u2019s introduction to the item, Zhang Ye kept the potion bottle into his ring, as if it was something that did not matter. The inventory was like a spatial storage bag. As for the item he had drawn, he was clearly not very pleased. What\u2019s the use for this? To peep in the ladies\u2019 room? Don\u2019t be ridiculous. Zhang Ye had always been a gentleman. He would not do such nasty things. He had never even thought about it. Besides, the time limit was just a short five minutes. It was not enough to see a thing!Outside, sounds from a commotion could be heard.After washing up, Zhang Ye opened the door to take a look. A bunch of tenants were crowding around in the hallway.\u201cLandlady auntie, the rooms are already expensive, yet you want to raise the rental?\u201d a university student said angrily.\u201cYeah, you are killing us. This is exploitation!\u201d a white-collared female shouted.Standing in the middle, Rao Aimin had a face which didn\u2019t care for emotional pleas. She squinted her eyes and confronted all of them, \u201cHouses are so expensive right now. Everyone else is increasing their prices. Do you think I am a charitable organization? If you don\u2019t want to stay, there are others who want to. Hmph, to think you dare to argue with me. You, Little Zhao, when you owed people money and they came looking for you, who lent you the money to pay it off? And you, Little Xue, when you didn\u2019t have enough for your school fees, who helped you?\u201dThe university student\u2019s temper suddenly subsided. Speaking softly, he said, \u201cDidn\u2019t I return it all back to you already?\u201dRao Aimin staring with her beautiful eyes, \u201cPaid back and that\u2019s it? Have you all forgotten the good I\u2019ve done for you? Eh? You ingrates! If you aren\u2019t staying, scram!\u201dMany of them stopped speaking, slowly moving back to their rooms.The others, who had not benefitted from Rao Aimin\u2019s help, continued to protest the increase, but were scolded back into their rooms. Her mouth was vicious; any ordinary person would never be able to win an argument against her!After everyone dispersed, Rao Aimin spotted Zhang Ye, \u201cHey, Little Zhang. Get over here!\u201dZhang Ye wanted to hide, but it was too late. Begrudgingly, he followed her to her place.After the door closed, Rao Aimin dragged her slippers-wearing feet to the coffee table, where a low-distribution cultural newspaper laid. She flipped it open to a page, \u201cI accidentally saw this in the papers I bought this morning. Not bad, kid. You were mentioned in the papers.\u201d She shook the papers and spoke in a strange manner, \u201cRecently, Beijing Radio Station\u2019s Literature channel\u2019s \u2018Late-night Ghost Stories\u2019 broadcasted a story called \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019. It attracted some good attention and even created history in the ratings of a late-night segment, gaining big success. It has even subtly broken the situation of physical and web publications for supernatural novels. According to this reporter, this story is an original work of the segment\u2019s DJ, Zhang Ye. Hence, the success of this program cannot be replicated.\u201dIt was also the first time Zhang Ye realized he was in the papers as he rushed forward, \u201cLet me see that.\u201d\u201cAlthough the distribution of this newspaper isn\u2019t very wide and is a bit biased, it\u2019s still not bad. You had such results just after entering the radio station?\u201d After attacking him once, Rao Aimin sat with her legs crossed and quickly changed the subject, \u201cWhen are you paying the rent? If you can\u2019t pay, then clear the debt by doing house chores. It\u2019s about time to clean the house again!\u201dHer attitude flipped faster than flipping a book!Zhang Ye smacked his lips, \u201cLandlady auntie, see, I\u2019m already now in the papers and am a person with status and fans. Can I\u2026\u201dRao Aimin did not wait for him to finish, \u201cWhat status do you have? Your only status now is a debtor!\u201dZhang Ye bargained, \u201cI can do house chores for you, but you need need to provide me lunch and dinner.\u201d He was almost unable to afford instant noodles.Rao Aimin leered at him, \u201cYou even gave a condition?\u201dZhang Ye grumbled, \u201cI have not even eaten lunch. I can\u2019t work, if I don\u2019t eat.\u201dRao Aimin clearly was reluctant as she curled her mouth before entering the kitchen. Afterwards, she threw a plastic bag with buns inside, \u201cThere\u2019s only this! I bought it in the morning!\u201dZhang Ye did not stand on ceremony. He wolfed them down right there and then without even heating it up.Rao Aimin said disdainfully, \u201cYou only know how to eat. Did you not eat in your previous life? However, let me tell you that eating buns can kill!\u201dZhang Ye had finished eating two buns in a blink of an eye as he nearly choked, \u201cEating buns can kill?\u201d\u201cWhy would I lie to you. There was a resident here who died last year because of eating buns. Who doesn\u2019t know that!\u201d Rao Aimin recalled.There was indeed a person who had died last year. Although Zhang Ye was not here back then, he had heard about it after moving in. He was immediately scared out of his wits. In his previous world, he had heard of Sudan Red G, gutter oil and melamine which were big problems for food hygiene. Zhang Ye was already frightened. And now hearing that someone near him had died eating buns, his face turned white, as he cherished his life greatly. He tried to vomit out the buns that he had just eaten, but failed in doing so. Just as he felt like he could not tolerate it any further, he quickly asked, \u201cHow did that person die? Was it terrible?\u201dRao Aimin swept the dust off her legs and sighed, \u201cIt was terrible, so terrible. That day, after he went out to buy buns, he got hit by a large truck, killing him!\u201d\u201cHe died from a collision?\u201d Zhang Ye nearly fainted. \u201cThen, what has that got to do with eating buns?\u201d\u201cI did not say there was any connection.\u201d Rao Aimin was in stitches, clearly having teased Zhang Ye.Zhang Ye, \u201c\u2026\u201dRao Aimin was feeling good as she smacked Zhang Ye in the head, \u201cAlright, kid. Quickly tidy up the place after eating. Also, fill up the bathtub for me. I want to take a bath.\u201dHer smiles were like flowers and her expressions were sultry!Although Rao Aimin teased Zhang Ye often and she had a bad temper, was older, had frequent mood swings, was cold to others, loved money like it was her life and was very venomous with her words, still.. she was very pretty!In Zhang Ye\u2019s dreams, he also wished to marry and have such a beautiful woman as his wife!Hai. But upon further thought, it was quite useless. So what if you had a beautiful wife? After seeing her for so long and getting used to her, it would all be the same. It did not matter if she looked pretty or not. What? You don\u2019t believe that? Let\u2019s give an example. Who wouldn\u2019t find his wife beautiful before marriage to the point of dying for love? But after being married for seven years, if you were to look into the eyes of your wife for more than a minute a day, then you can be considered to have been stung by your conscience and have rekindled your feelings!Oh, of course, if you are outraged and say things like, \u201cBullsh*t, even after another 50 years, or even 500 years, I will still find my wife to be as pretty as a flower, one that can topple countries and is the world\u2019s number one beauty.\u201d Well, then I don\u2019t even have to ask. Your wife must be beside you reading this book!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I need to go out and will only come back in the afternoon!\u201d\u201cAh? What are you doing?\u201d Zhang Ye asked.\u201cWhat I do is none of your business!\u201d Big Sis Rao\u2019s voice was never friendly. \u201cI\u2019ll leave the house for you to tidy up. Clean it well. Especially those windows on the South side. I\u2019m leaving. Remember to close the door after you leave and don\u2019t touch my items!\u201dWith a slam, the door on the first floor closed.There was only Zhang Ye in the house. After he grumbled and complained a few times, he did not sit idle and began working hard. He knew Big Sis Rao was tough on the outside, but soft on the inside. Many of the tenants may complain about her venomous tongue, but many of them had received help from her. Zhang Ye was one of them. Every time he hadn\u2019t eaten, wasn\u2019t it Big Sis Rao who settled his meals? Hence, he knew to be grateful. Since he had agreed to clean up her house, he naturally did so properly. After working hard all day, Zhang Ye was done and was covered in sweat. It was already noon, so he finished the remaining two vegetable-stuffed buns.As the ancient saying goes, when the belly is full, the mind is among the maids\u2026Er, that\u2019s not right.As the ancient saying goes, one should have an afternoon nap after having one\u2019s meal and get a well-deserved weekend.Zhang Ye did not plan on going against the ancient sayings. However, he could not rest with his body sweaty. He eyed the bathtub in Rao\u2019s house with evil intentions. All Zhang Ye had in his bathroom was a shower tap. It wasn\u2019t thrilling enough, while Big Sis Rao\u2019s bathtub was a big bathtub. Zhang Ye had never enjoyed the sensation of bathing in a bathtub. Furthermore, he had filled it with hot water before, so it would be a waste not to use it. So although Rao Aimin had warned Zhang Ye not to touch her things, Zhang Ye did not heed the warning. After all, she would only return in the afternoon.Her house had two bathrooms and the bathroom in question was in Rao Aimin\u2019s bedroom, upstairs.The bathroom was large and the bathtub was very wide. Touching the water, Zhang Ye found that it was still warm.Zhang Ye closed the door and began taking off his clothes. He threw his underwear and T-shirt into a clothes basket that was beside the washing machine and laid down in the bathtub. After he pulled the white curtain, he comfortably heaved a sigh of relief. Soon, he closed his eyes involuntarily as it was an extreme enjoyment.Half an hour\u2026One hour\u2026Unknowingly, he had fallen asleep.When Zhang Ye opened his eyes again, he was awoken by the slamming of a door nearby. He realized the water\u2019s temperature was no longer hot.\u201cPhew, this damn sun is really burning me up!\u201d The voice of a woman speaking to herself came from beyond the curtain!Who was talking?The landlady was back!Zhang Ye immediately reacted. His face was green. Sh*t, why is she back so early? Didn\u2019t she say\u2026Heh, what do you mean early? He had slept so soundly. Zhang Ye was in a panic. He felt like he had been caught red-handed and felt extremely embarrassed. But no matter what he did now, it was useless. Zhang Ye tilted his head and looked through the gap of the curtain, thinking of admitting his mistake.However, just this peek made it worse!Zhang Ye felt his nose turn warm. He nearly couldn\u2019t control it!About two meters away, Rao Aimin had taken off her top and threw it into the washing machine. She did not wear much, it being Summer. Her back was facing Zhang Ye and she was currently bending her arms to unhook her bra. And soon, the nude-colored embroidered bra was taken off and thrown to the side. Her hands moved down as she cursed at the weather, while she began taking off the gray skirt she was wearing. With an unbuckle, the dress fell to the bathroom floor. After taking a step forward, Rao Aimin used her toes to fling the skirt into the washing machine.The landlady was always a person whose actions and words were swift like lightning!How swift was it? It reached the point\u2026where just as Zhang Ye was about to shout out to her, the landlady had taken off her bra and skirt at a speed which you can call as swift as lightning! Now she was bending over to take take off the pantyhose that covered those perfectly elastic legs of hers.Zhang Ye quickly held back the voice that he almost released. He remembered the scene of him coming to this place while looking for a place to stay, back in his previous world. The 30-square-meter room he was currently renting was originally rented by a jobless young hooligan. He had drank too much with a friend one day and, together with his friend, insulted Rao Aimin sexually. With his own eyes, Zhang Ye saw Rao Aimin, a female, beat the two hooligans from upstairs all the way to downstairs, with them not even being able to hit back. They ran away with their faces bruised. With the room empty, it was rented to Zhang Ye. As such, Zhang Ye knew how powerful the landlady was and was always in awe.She had almost stripped off everything!He had also almost seen enough!It was already too late to say, \u201cSorry, I\u2019m here!\u201dZhang Ye did not want to end up being beaten up like those two hooligans. Although the world background was different now, there had not been any fundamental changes in his interpersonal relations. The landlady was still that woman who had the ability to fight against two young males single-handedly. What would be his outcome if she kicked him with all she got? Furthermore, Zhang Ye was just taking his first steps in becoming a well-known radio host. If he was caught peeking, then wouldn\u2019t it be embarrassing? He definitely could not let the landlady discover him. With a flash of inspiration in his mind, he quickly made a decision. He did not dare to make any big actions, as he was afraid the sound of the water splashing would reveal his presence. He could only quickly and gently open the game ring\u2019s interface and take out the invisibility potion that he had drawn in the afternoon. Quickly, he opened and drank down the transparent liquid!In a second, Zhang Ye could see his body turn transparent and it seemed to merge with the water. He had magically disappeared!The game virtual screen began counting down!4:59, 4:58...Coincidentally, after taking off the nude-colored stocking, Rao Aimin turned around and pulled open the bathtub\u2019s curtain and looked inside.Zhang Ye did not have the mental facilities to consider the miracle of being invisible as his body tensed up. He did not even dare to breathe. Under these circumstances, it was very difficult to hold his breath. He endured it so much that even his eyebrows stood up. The fragrance of a mature woman impacted his nostrils!That skin\u2026That body\u2026As for Rao Aimin, she really did not see Zhang Ye, who had disappeared because of the invisibility potion. She muttered to herself, \u201cThat kid Zhang Ye did not release the water, even after knowing I was going out. Was he waiting for me to use it to water the plants? To think that he became a host with such slow thinking. This is the first time I heard of radio stations being charity organizations. They will take in anybody!\u201dZhang Ye was wondering how much she hated him for her to scold him even when he wasn\u2019t around.Some people may have a spiked tongue on the surface, but what was said was usually done in a joking fashion. However, Rao Aimin\u2019s spiked tongue came from her bones. She loved to scold, taunt and put down people. Wasn\u2019t this so? Even with Zhang Ye not being around, Rao Aimin had no intentions of being light with her biting remarks, even in private.\u201cHai, let\u2019s see if the water has cooled down!\u201d Suddenly, Rao Aimin reached out her hand towards the water without any warning!Zhang Ye\u2019s soul nearly flew out due to his fright. Seeing the landlady\u2019s hand move towards his thigh, sh*t! He was about to be discovered!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His invisibility was just an illusion; it was a trick. He could still feel his body physically exist and the landlady could naturally be able to touch him, too. It wasn\u2019t as if he had completely disappeared. If he was touched, not only would Zhang Ye have to endure Rao Aimin\u2019s fury, but his greatest secret would be exposed, too. The game ring \u2013 no one could ever know of its existence. Not everyone could accept something so illogical and out of this world. And so Zhang Ye\u2019s reaction was abnormally fast and agile!A split second!A second split!At this moment of danger, he\u2026. He did nothing!Well, luckily Rao Aimin\u2019s hand did not dip herself into the water. It was only deep enough to test the water temperature with half of her palm.\u201cIt\u2019s still warm.\u201d Rao Aimin said to herself. She bent over and released the bathtub\u2019s water. At the same time, she turned on the hot water faucet to fill up the tub.Invisibility time duration was still valid for four and a half minutes!Zhang Ye was glad that he had not washed his hair, nor had he applied shower foam and that his body was rather clean. Otherwise, any floating things on the water\u2019s surface would have given him away. There\u2019s only one plan left \u2013 RUN!Over there, Rao Aimin was already unable to withstand the hot weather and could not wait for the water. She took a step forward with her tight and beautiful legs and, with a tip-toe, she stepped towards Zhang Ye! At this moment, Zhang Ye could not remain motionless. Noticing that the landlady\u2019s gaze was not on the bathtub, he took advantage of the hot water splashing down to conceal his moves. He bent his waist and carefully avoided those white legs of hers and stood up from the bathtub immediately following that! At the same time, Rao Aimin\u2019s other leg had made the stride as she stood in the bathtub, too!\u201cOh?\u201d Maybe it was due to the turbulation Zhang Ye had caused while standing up, but Rao Aimin felt as if something was amiss as her face turned vexed.Twenty centimeters!The two people were separated by such a tiny distance!Zhang Ye held his breath and did not make a sound. He didn\u2019t even dare to blink!After observing the surroundings, Rao Aimin seemed to brush away her suspicions. With a splash, she sat down in the bathtub and let out a comfortable sigh of relief.There were still three minutes left of invisibility!Rao Aimin\u2019s hip was nearly about to touch Zhang Ye\u2019s legs, which were still in the bathtub!Zhang Ye knew that he could not wait any longer. Seeing the landlady cross her legs in midair as she reached out to take the shower gel from the counter, he took the opportunity to quickly pull a leg out of the bathtub, which was quickly followed by the second leg. Although the sound of him coming out was drowned by the rushing water, it still seemed abnormal. Rao Aimin, who was lathering the shower gel, frowned and focused once again. Her senses were very keen.She was met with silence again!Two more minutes left! Another 1:59!During the periods when he could not move, Zhang Ye could not help but check the landlady\u2019s body out. His throat was dry, but he did not dare to swallow. It was extremely uncomfortable!Slender!Well-proportioned!This was the body evaluation Zhang Ye gave to the landlady. Although he had never dated because of his looks and height, with the advanced information age, he was no stranger to females. Even if he had not seen it in person, how could he have not seen it in pictures? However, Rao Aimin\u2019s body lines were something Zhang Ye had seen for the first time. It was too well-proportioned and was perfect in all the right places. Even at her age, she did not have the slightest flab anywhere. There was not even a tiny amount of fat on her belly!Beautiful and a nice figure!Look at her and then look back at himself?Hai, sometimes the Heavens were unfair. Some people had things that he would not be able to obtain, even if he worked hard all his life. If he had such excellent looks like Rao Aimin by being handsome and tall\u2026 The thought about becoming a celebrity? To ability to develop his career? It could at least reduce the hard work he needed to do by a decade!It would be great if this world did not judge people by their looks. This was something that Zhang Ye had always felt helpless against. Look at the television programs from his world. What sort of rotten programs were \u201cThe Voice of China\u201d and \u201cSuper Boy\u201d!?Why weren\u2019t there competitions like \u201cThe Leg Hair of China\u201d?Why weren\u2019t there pageants like \u201cSuper Leg Hair 2014\u201d?If the artistic realm did not discriminate and had ranks in the artistic world, then if he could make leg hair become popular, then Zhang Ye would not have such a low starting point. He would not have needed to endure the criticisms and difficulty in becoming an unseen radio host.Forget it. There was no time to think about this!Zhang Ye walked sideways as he slowly moved around the bathtub\u2019s curtain. After spending thirty seconds, he managed to reach the outermost part of the curtain. The opening to the curtain was also where Rao Aimin\u2019s head was. Rao Aimin was enjoying her bath and had already lathered up a lot of foam with her hands. Zhang Ye took a final reluctant look at her fully-foamed body, before squeezing out of the curtain. He had also accidentally touched a strand of the landlady\u2019s hair, but thankfully she did not notice it.The hair tickled him when it brushed past Zhang Ye\u2019s thigh.There was less than 20 seconds left to his invisibility!Zhang Ye did not have time to reminiscence, as he gently grabbed his clothes from the washing basket beside the washing machine. He silently took a few deep breaths. Thankfully, the landlady threw her clothes onto the washing machine and not into the clothes basket, or else she would have felt that something was amiss after seeing Zhang Ye\u2019s clothes.Next, he needed to leave the bathroom. There was no way to hide the sound of opening the door, but Zhang Ye could not care less. Waiting any further would expose him, hence he carefully held the door handle!Ka!The door made a sound!Before he could rush out, the voice of the landlady came in a killing fashion, \u201c\u2026Who?\u201dThe curtain was sewn, but it was not impossible to look out. Zhang Ye knew this, so he did not even wait before rushing out the bathroom. Only then did he pretend to open a door from the outside and say in a cold sweat, \u201cUh, Landlady auntie, it\u2019s me. Are you back?\u201dRao Aimin\u2019s voice came from inside, \u201cOh, it\u2019s you. Heh, why are you still in my house? Why didn\u2019t I see you when I returned home?\u201dZhang Ye immediately answered, \u201cOh, I was outside helping you wipe the windows.\u201d\u201cReally? You sure are quite dedicated. Alright. I\u2019m still bathing. Since you did well, you can come here for dinner tonight!\u201d Rao Aimin said.Zhang Ye said, \u201cAlright, then I\u2019ll go back first.\u201dRao Aimin said, \u201cAlright, scram.\u201dZhang Ye heaved a sigh of relief as the duration of the invisibility potion expired. Seeing his body slowly turning visible, he wore his clothes and dried the wet stains he had left behind with a cloth to remove the evidence of his crime\u2026 After cleaning up the scene, he left Rao Aimin\u2019s house.Today, his heart nearly failed!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The main director, Zhao Guozhou, said with glee, \u201cI have a piece of good news to tell everyone. Our Literature Channel\u2019s overall average listenership has exceeded the music channel for two consecutive days for the weekend. We have once again taken over the top three spots in the station. There is no way to separate this result from everyone\u2019s hard work. I suggest that everyone give a round of applause for yourself.\u201dBba Bba Bba!Everyone clapped and cheered!As the news channel and the traffic channel were special, there was no way to compete for the top two spots in the Beijing Radio Station. It was the same for television programs. How could a variety show or drama show compete with the Central News broadcast? No one would compete, except for certain heaven-defying programs or events, as there was no point and no meaning. However, third place was something to compete for. The third place was always something the music and literature frequency channels competed for. The competition had always been fierce over the past couple of years. Everyone heaved a sigh of relief after regaining third place from the music channel, having been suppressed by the music channel for months.\u201cNext, I will announce the listenership for the weekend.\u201d Zhao Guozhou picked up the document.\u201cTalk About the World\u201d listenership 3.19%, 3.27%.\u201cEntertainment Daily\u201d listenership 2.13%, 2.22%\u201cLate-night Ghost Stories\u201d listenership 1.39%, 1.42%.\u201cLaughter Daily\u201d listenership 0.92%, 0.93%The two numbers were respectively for Saturday and Sunday.Zhao Guozhou announced from first place, \u201cTalk About the World\u201d, to last place, \u201cOld and Young Story Club\u201d, and finally summarized his speech while looking at everyone, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to talk about Xiaomei. \u2018Talk About the World\u2019 has always been number one in our channel and its listenership has always been very stable. Right, I need to specially praise Zhang Ye this time. For us to finally exceed the music channel, we cannot ignore the contributions \u201cLate-night Ghost Stories\u201d has made. It managed to go from last place all the way to a segment with great listenership and that was all thanks to Zhang Ye. And maybe it was because it was the weekend with people sleeping later, which\u00a0made \u201cLate-night Ghost Stories\u201d have another jump in its ratings. Very good, Little Zhang. Keep it up!\u201dZhang Ye humbly said, \u201cDirector Zhao: yes, I will.\u201dTian Bin gritted his teeth as he glanced at him with a complex look.The number one girl, Wang Xiaomei, the other hosts and the staff looked at Zhang Ye. They all had different thoughts about seeing this rookie host who had such outstanding results.Zhao Guozhou nodded, \u201cNext, let\u2019s discuss about the week\u2019s tasks.\u201dZhang Ye did not like meetings, as they would make him sleepy. It was the same during college. He always could not help but sleep after reaching a certain point. But surprisingly, he did not sleep today. As the talks droned on, Zhao Guozhou suddenly jumped up on the meeting table and danced the Rumba. Zhang Ye was instantly interested as he watched with worry at those old legs dancing and relished the sight. And then\u2026well, Zhang Ye woke up. He noticed the host of \u201cOld and Young Story Club\u201d beside him. Fifty-plus-year-old Teacher Feng was pulling at his arms to wake him up. Zhang Ye immediately gave Teacher Feng a grateful glance. Hai, but he slept again.Zhao Guozhou was still droning on as he said to Wang Xiaomei, \u201cXiaomei, for tonight\u2019s \u201cTalk About the World\u201d live broadcast at 8 P.M., it would be the rare topic on emotions. You will need to have intensive interactions with the listeners, so are you well-prepared?\u201d \u201cTalk About the World\u201d was a more open segment. It would talk about almost anything under the sun, including about society and emotions,Wang Xiaomei said in a relaxed fashion, \u201cLeader, be rest assured. Although most of the shows were pre-recorded over the years, I have done several live broadcasts, too. There shouldn\u2019t be a problem.\u201d\u201cThen, that\u2019s good.\u201d Zhao Guozhou smiled, \u201cI\u2019m at ease with you hosting it.\u201dWang Xiaomei asked, \u201cI\u2019m now lacking a guest. The counselor, Teacher Jiang, we invited the last time can\u2019t come, as he\u2019s out of town. We were informed only this morning, but if there\u2019s really no one, I can do it alone.\u201dZhao Guozhou gave some thought before saying, \u201cIt\u2019s better if there\u2019s a guest.\u201dA small director suggested, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we get one of our channel\u2019s hosts to make a guest appearance?\u201dZhao Guozhou\u2019s gaze suddenly landed on Zhang Ye and, with a blink, he seemed to have an idea, \u201cLittle Zhang, why don\u2019t you go? You are about the same age as Xiaomei and you are both young, so your values and emotional aspects should be similar and work well together. You can also use this opportunity to promote our channel\u2019s late-night program. What say you?\u201dZhang Ye was stunned, \u201cI\u2019ll follow the Leader\u2019s instructions.\u201dZhao Guozhou made his decision, \u201cAlright, then let\u2019s have it that way.\u201dThis was naturally a good thing for Zhang Ye. Although his ratings had improved by leaps and bounds, breaking records, it was still a great distance away, when compared to the station\u2019s top program, \u201cTalk About the World\u201d. They were completely not on the same level. If he could take advantage of her show to benefit his, it would be the best outcome. Besides, Zhang Ye never gave up the opportunity for him to have an appearance. His goal was to be famous, so every opportunity to make an appearance was an opportunity for him to raise his Reputation points. Zhang Ye was dying for such an opportunity!However, it was clear that Wang Xiaomei was reluctant to accept this as she said unhappily, \u201cDirector Zhao, shouldn\u2019t you find a teacher with more experience?\u201dZhao Guozhou said, \u201cLittle Zhang goes without a script, be it a live or pre-recorded broadcast, and you are doubting his ability to speak? I don\u2019t think there is a problem.\u201dThe meeting ended.People shuffled out from the conference room.Zhang Ye definitely had to talk to Wang Xiaomei about the live broadcast. As he ran to catch up with Wang Xiaomei, \u201cTeacher Wang.\u201dWang Xiaomei stopped, \u201cLittle Zhang, what\u2019s the matter?\u201dZhang Ye thought in his mind that wasn\u2019t it clear what he was doing, as he said, \u201cAbout the live broadcast, shouldn\u2019t we\u2026\u201dWang Xiaomei cut him off, \u201cThis episode\u2019s live broadcast does not have a script. We will just listen to the connected listener\u2019s questions and give solutions. You do not need to speak much during the broadcast. You also should not speak, unless I allow you to do so. I have my rhythm, so you should just follow mine. Do not express too many of your personal opinions and recommendations in matters of the heart. I don\u2019t think you have ever dated, so leave all the technical questions to me. If you were to say something wrong or give a wrong suggestion, you will influence my program\u2019s listenership and the listeners\u2019 trust!\u201dZhang Ye, \u201c\u2026\u201dAfter Wang Xiaomei dropped those words, she left.Zhang Ye thought, \u201cDid I provoke you? Why do you need to do that? I didn\u2019t do anything to you, yet you had already attacked me repeatedly. Don\u2019t you trust your colleagues? And what was that attitude? I\u2019m, after all, our channel\u2019s host with listenership rates that place third; can\u2019t you give me the most basic amount of respect? And to not let me express my personal opinion. just because I have never dated? You sure are funny. Thinking about the times back in school when so many young girls chased after me, but I never bothered paying any attention to them. This bro\u2019s relationship experience is completely\u2026completely\u2026*cough*, forget it. Let\u2019s not brag anymore.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Wang Xiaomei was already here, head bowed and busy with her preparations. She did not bother to look at Zhang Ye. Her phone call editor was also in the room, a youth whose face had many moles. Compared to Wang Xiaomei, he was much nicer.\u201cTeacher Zhang, you have come? Please, take a seat here.\u201d\u201cOkay. This is my earpiece?\u201d\u201cYes, please put it on and test it. I will adjust it for you.\u201d\u201cYes, it sounds just nice; the mic is fine, too.\u201d\u201cThen, the live broadcast is nine minutes away. I will go to the other side.\u201dThe phone call editor went into the soundproof room. With every minute that passed, he gave a gesture to signal.In the last thirty seconds, Wang Xiaomei suddenly said, \u201cI\u2019ll repeat it; do not speak without thought and follow my views and rhythm.\u201dZhang Ye replied indifferently, \u201cAlright.\u201d She was, after all, more experienced than him. Regardless of results or experience, Zhang Ye could not compete. Moreover, he was here with hopes of promoting his program. Therefore, he did not take her attitude to heart.Three, two, one. The broadcast began!Wang Xiaomei fiddled with her equipment. She said, smilingly, \u201cI hope everyone is well. Welcome to \u2018Talk About the World\u2019. I am your DJ, Wang Xiaomei. Some of you might know that today\u2019s live broadcast topic is about the matters of the heart. We are fortunate to have a guest with us today. He\u2019s our very own channel\u2019s \u201cLate-night Ghost Stories\u201d host, also known as the author of \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019, Teacher Zhang Ye. Please say a few words to our listeners.\u201dZhang Ye immediately spoke into his attached mic, \u201cHello, listeners and friends. I am Zhang Ye. I\u2019m very honoured to be here today with Teacher Wang to listen and try to solve everyone\u2019s matters of the heart.\u201dWang Xiaomei followed up, \u201cThe hotlines are already open. If you have met with any love issues, please feel free to call in.\u201dOn the broadcast platform, there was a computer shown, which displayed the listeners\u2019 and website\u2019s real time comments. Just as expected of the Literature Channel\u2019s top program, the discussion atmosphere was very strong.User3577: Love topic program? Haha, this is great. Let\u2019s see Teacher Wang take on love issues!User1041: Teacher Zhang Ye is here, too? My wife and I are listening to \u201cGhost Blows Out the Light\u201d every night these days!User5502: \u201cGhost Blows Out the Light\u201d? It\u2019s a ghost story, right? There aren\u2019t any good ghost stories these days. I\u2019ve been let down by supernatural novels long ago!User2890: Friend above, that\u2019s where you are wrong, I guarantee you that \u201cGhost Blows Out the Light\u201d is different from any supernatural novels you have listened to before; it\u2019s a classic amongst classics!User5502: Is that so? Then, I will go give it a listen tonight.User0019: Just the title alone sounds good. I will listen to it tonight, too.A star program\u2019s promotional effect is really good. Zhang Ye knew that tonight\u2019s broadcast rating should be able to go up a little more.On the other side, the phone call editor signalled; the call screening was done. Of course, such calls have to be screened. After all, it was a live broadcast and there would be troublemakers. As such, a professional phone call editor had to judge and pick, filtering for the correct topics and the reliable callers.Wang Xiaomei nodded, \u201cOkay, our first caller has connected.\u201d\u201cHello? Is it me?\u201d It was a female listener, excited, \u201cIs it really me?\u201dWang Xiaomei said softly, \u201cHaha, yes. How can I help you?\u201dThe female listener quickly answered, \u201cTeacher Wang, Teacher Wang, you are my idol. My boyfriend and I both like you very much\u2026.\u201d Upon saying that, her tone became a sigh, \u201cBut my boyfriend has been ignoring me recently. In the past, he wouldn\u2019t get angry with me and now, he\u2019s been throwing his temper at me every day. He even goes to the internet to chat with other girls and flirts with them. I peeked at his messages and they all say \u201cAre you awake?\u201d, \u201cHave you slept?\u201d, \u201cGood night.\u201d, and \u201cRemember to eat on time.\u201d He has never been this concerned towards me before! Teacher. please tell me\u2026 What should I do?\u201dWang Xiaomei frowned, \u201cLady, towards these kind of men who don\u2019t care about you, my suggestion has always been to break up. Such kinds of messages of concern might not seem like a big deal. It could be concern for ordinary friends. But let me tell you, this is actually a big issue. If it goes on, it could get dangerous. It also shows that his heart is not with you. If you mention an intention to break up, you are also sending him a message of where your limits are. If you bear with it, he will only be more encouraged and get further and further away from you. If that is so, why not just break up now? See if he is willing to change; if he does, you can consider being with him. If not, then it goes to show that he really does not care about you. It\u2019s better to end it early in that case.\u201dThe female listener replied, \u201cIs that really so?\u201dWang Xiaomei looked at Zhang Ye, \u201cWhat do you think, Teacher Zhang?\u201dZhang Ye blinked, \u201cI feel it\u2019s better to communicate first. A relationship is basically between two people. It might be because you have him too tight on a leash, leading him to feel like running away.\u201d Noticing Wang Xiaomei\u2019s stern eyes, Zhang Ye added, \u201cIf communicating doesn\u2019t work, Teacher Wang\u2019s suggestion could be a way out, too.\u201dOn the computer display, the listeners had big reactions.\u201cTeacher Zhang Ye is a troublemaker!\u201d\u201cYou should just break up with this kind of guy. Teacher Wang is right!\u201d\u201cCorrect. If it were me, I would have given that guy a good scolding! Whatever does he mean by a problem between the two!?\u201d\u201cHaha, I like listening to Teacher Wang\u2019s talking down about people; it\u2019s so forthright. Teacher Zhang Ye, don\u2019t make trouble!\u201dOne phone call\u2026\u2026Three phone calls\u2026\u2026Five phone calls\u2026\u2026Wang Xiaomei was talking down to all of them! She advised them all to break up!Wang Xiaomei obviously thought that Zhang Ye spoke too much and did not follow her directions, so for the next few calls, she did not even ask for Zhang Ye\u2019s views. Zhang Ye sat in his seat for a good half hour without saying anything. Zhang Ye wasn\u2019t too happy either; he was here as a guest to express his views. Oh, but you are good, forcing me to express views that are yours? Based on what!\u201cOur program is coming to an end soon. Let\u2019s go for a commercial break and we will be back to answer the last call.\u201d Wang Xiaomei signalled with a finger to her phone call editor.Zhang Ye simply switched off his mic since he was prepared to not speak anymore.During the commercial break, Wang Xiaomei stared coldly at Zhang Ye, \u201cWhat did I tell you earlier?\u201dZhang Ye retorted: \u201cWe were just giving our own opinions; what\u2019s the problem with it? I feel that matters of the heart should be given advice; as to whether they will break up or not should be left to themselves. We are only giving a point of view and our thoughts to them, not encouraging them to break up. This encouragement is well-liked by the listeners, but they just want to see the world burn. Who doesn\u2019t like some excitement? But what about the couple? What about their feelings?\u201dWang Xiaomei was on fire, \u201cDo I need you to teach me?\u201dZhang Ye threw back his arms, \u201cSo I will not say a thing anymore; you talk.\u201dThe two of them were very unhappy. Zhang Ye did not care about respecting seniors anymore; anything can be solved amicably, but not something concerning principles.After the commercial break, the live broadcast continued.Wang Xiaomei suppressed her anger, \u201cLet us answer the last call.\u201d\u201cHello?\u201d A voice of a very quiet female, young and likely not over twenty five years of age, spoke.\u201cHow are you? What issues did you encounter? You can tell it to us.\u201d Wang Xiaomei said.But it was this last call that had a big problem. The girl said \u201cMy name is Xiao Li and I am twenty-three years old. I am a third year university student and my boyfriend graduated this year. But, his family arranged for him to further his studies overseas and he will only be back after five years.\u201dWang Xiaomei questioned, \u201cWhere will he be going?\u201dThe university student said, \u201cNew York. I know that if he leaves, our relationship will end. So I am trying my best to make him stay, but he refuses. He even made me promise to wait for him, saying that he will marry me when he is back after five years. But, I don\u2019t believe it.\u201dWang Xiaomei, seemingly unaffected by Zhang Ye\u2019s words earlier, instead became more persistent in her way of handling these matters, \u201cLady, if your boyfriend really loves you, I think he would choose to stay behind. But it seems that he puts his career and development over your love. Such a guy doesn\u2019t deserve to be kept. If you really wait for him for five years, then you are really silly. I don\u2019t believe in long-distance relationships; even if the love is strong, it will fade, eventually. End it sooner than later; you should think about it.\u201dThe university student replied weakly, \u201cI\u2019ve already thought it through.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d Wang Xiaomei pleasingly said, \u201cThat is all we can help you with.\u201dThe university student laughed lightly, \u201cThank you, Teacher. I know what to do now. This phone call will serve as the last message from me. I hope my boyfriend can hear this.\u201dOh no! There was something unusual with the call.Wang Xiaomei sensing something was wrong, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dThe university student replied lightly \u201cHolding my boyfriend\u2019s razorblade. Without him, there is nothing for me to live for anymore. Goodbye!\u201dZhang Ye shivered in fear!Wang Xiaomei suddenly felt anxious!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Boatloads of messages began flooding in!\u201cIs that true?\u201d\u201cTeacher Wang, quickly say something! Don\u2019t let her commit suicide!\u201d\u201cQuickly persuade her! She\u2019s just a twenty-two-year-old child!\u201d\u201cWhy is she taking things so hard? Miss, you must not die! How can you do this to your parents?\u201dHowever, the messages left by the netizens obviously could not be seen by the young lady!Wang Xiaomei gasped as she quickly said to the female university student, \u201cSister! Sister! You must not commit suicide! Listen to what this elder sister has to say!\u201dThe female university student replied, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to say anything more, Teacher Wang. I\u2019ve already decided that I can\u2019t live on in a world without him. The distance between Beijing and New York is the world\u2019s greatest distance. By leaving today, I hope that I can be closer to him. I believe we can be together in Heaven, forever.\u201dWang Xiaomei shouted, \u201cWhy are you so silly!\u201dThe female university student said, \u201cI\u2019m not silly; it\u2019s because I love him.\u201d\u201cPut down the razorblade first!\u201d Wang Xiaomei hastily said, \u201cThis is you being irresponsible to yourself! It is also being irresponsible to your family! How can you just die like that after your parents painstakingly brought you up? You are too selfish! Have you thought about what others feel? Have you thought about how sad your parents and friends will be after you leave?\u201dWith a life on the line, Zhang Ye could not be bothered to argue with Wang Xiaomei. He signaled to Wang Xiaomei to stabilize the girl as he ran out of the broadcasting room into the telephone editor\u2019s room. He closed the door and shouted, \u201cWhat are you dazing around for! Quickly, call the police!\u201dThe telephone editor panicked, \u201cCall the police? Right! Call the police!\u201dZhang Ye directed, \u201cHurry! Hurry! Hurry! Give her telephone number to the police! Find out her address and quickly go to her rescue! If not, it will be too late!\u201dThe telephone editor immediately followed his instructions, \u201cHello, is this 110?\u201dSuddenly, the door leading out was pushed open as seven people rushed in!The group was led by Zhao Guozhou. He angrily shouted, \u201cWhat the heck? Ah?\u201dThe telephone editor pretended he was busy on the phone with the police and did not dare to respond to Director Zhao\u2019s question.Zhao Guozhou had a bad temper and immediately slammed the table, \u201cHow did you screen the telephone? Eh? How can you let just any telephone call through? What were you doing!?\u201d If the call was not chosen, then the female university student would not have listened to Wang Xiaomei\u2019s extremist advice and might not have decided on committing suicide. Taking 10,000 steps back, even if the girl eventually chose to take her life, at least it wouldn\u2019t have been during their Literature Channel\u2019s live broadcast and would have had nothing to do with their radio station. However, now with the telephone call having been connected, to the listeners, it was clear that the girl had decided to end her life due to Wang Xiaomei\u2019s words and their program. With the negative news, it was obvious that their radio station would be pushed to the tip of the plank. \u201cTalk About the World\u201d? The Literature Channel\u2019s number one listenership program? Those were all jokes! From the pressure of public opinion, their program would definitely face being taken off the air! There would be no way to recover from this!The Literature Channel\u2019s deputy was also extremely anxious, \u201cHow is it, now?\u201dThe telephone editor put down the phone and said, guiltily, \u201cThe police have said that they will need at least an hour to find her address and her house. They asked us to delay as long as possible!\u201dThe \u201cTalk About the World\u201d program editing team turned pale, \u201cAn hour? There is no way we can do it!\u201dZhao Guozhou shouted, \u201cYou have to do it, even if you can\u2019t! Hold on to her! Definitely do not allow her to commit suicide! Or our Literature Channel is doomed! All the programs will suffer a devastating blow!\u201d They were working in the media, so they definitely knew the power of public opinion and the media!The back door opened once again!The radio station\u2019s leader also rushed in, \u201cOld Zhao!\u201dZhao Guozhou came forward, \u201cStation Head Jia! Why are you here?\u201dThis was an old man, who was also the Beijing Radio Station\u2019s Deputy Station Head, \u201cYou\u2019re asking why I\u2019m here? I\u2019m here to see the trouble your program has caused! Immediately settle it for me!\u201dZhao Guozhou said, \u201cWe will definitely do our best!\u201d He said to Zhang Ye, \u201cLittle Zhang! Go back and persuade her! You must hold her for at least an hour! You can ignore the programs after this! Everything will be delayed!\u201dZhang Ye responded and ran back into the broadcasting room.In here, it was soundproof, so there was no noise, only Wang Xiaomei\u2019s continuous persuasion.\u201cSister, you are still young. This elder sister is experienced, so you must hear what I say.\u201d Wang Xiaomei said earnestly, \u201cJust now, what I said was a bit extremist. Actually, if the both of you still have feelings for each other, it is not impossible. I have handled several such cases where the men are in a distant land for many years, but the relationship between the two when he returns is still as good as ever. In the end, they got married and had kids, leading a blissful life. Why can\u2019t you?\u201dThe female university student laughed, \u201cThe distant land you say is at most in the south and north of China. Taking a plane or a train will allow them to quickly meet. But it\u2019s different between me and my boyfriend. Beijing and New York are on opposite sides of the world and is the world\u2019s greatest distance. Also, due to the financial limitations and the issue with passports, we will probably never meet in the entire five years. I know this more than anyone else. Thank you, Teacher Wang. Thank you for your consolation. I have already made my decision. Let me say sorry to my parents and friends here. I\u2019m really sorry.\u201dBa La!The sound of the blade sounded again!At this second, Deputy Station Head Jia, Zhao Guozhou and all the members of the management outside covered their mouths and turned silent!Wang Xiaomei shouted, \u201cNo!\u201dThe female university student felt liberated as she said, \u201cGoodbye.\u201dZhao Guozhou\u2019s lips turned pale. It\u2019s over! We can\u2019t hold on anymore!The other female staff members of the Literature Channel all screamed as they covered their ears. They could not bear to see this scene!Wang Xiaomei still wanted to persuade her, but she was already at a loss for words. The female university student was clearly a youth in the literature and arts department. She was artistic and very sensitive. She was immersed in her world and nothing could penetrate into it. This sort of person was the most terrifying, as there was no way of persuading such a person! Wang Xiaomei had already tried her best, but at this moment, she, as the person who always helped solve the emotional problems others, had claimed to speak for women, but felt powerless and weak for the first time in her life!She was just 22 years old!She was still a university student!She was ending her life, just because of a relationship?Zhang Ye\u2019s face sank as he angrily turned on his microphone and rebuked, \u201cLady, do you know what sort of person I hate the most in my entire life? It\u2019s self-righteous artistic youths, like you!\u201dWang Xiaomei was shocked, \u201cWhat are you saying!?\u201dZhao Guozhou and the telephone editor outside were stunned!At this moment, on the brink of disaster, why are you provoking her? Do you really want her to commit suicide?\u201cWhy?\u201d The female university student remained silent for a moment before saying, \u201cI\u2019m not self-righteous! I understand the gap in our feelings very well!\u201dZhang Ye coldly sneered, \u201cThis is why you are self-righteous. There is no distance for feelings. You previously said the distance between Beijing and New York is the furthest? That\u2019s simply ridiculous!\u201d\u201cWhy? Isn\u2019t that the furthest?\u201d The female university student asked.Zhang Ye pondered before saying a famous poem from his world.\u201cThe furthest distance in the world is not the distance between opposite sides of the world. It is that you don\u2019t know that I love you, when I stand in front of you.\u201d\u201cThe furthest distance in the world is not that you don\u2019t know I love you when I stand in front of you. It is when I cannot say I love you, when I love you so madly.\u201d\u201cThe furthest distance in the world is not that I cannot say I love you, when I love you so madly. It is that I have to bury it in my heart, despite the unbearable yearning.\u201d\u201cThe furthest distance in the world is not that I have to bury it in my heart despite the unbearable yearning. It is when we cannot be together, even when we love each other.\u201d\u201cThe furthest distance in the world is not that we cannot be together, when we love each other. It is when we turn a blind eye to it, despite knowing true love conquers all.\u201d\u201cThe furthest distance in the world is not the distance between two distant trees. It is when branches cannot depend on each other in the wind, despite growing from the same root.\u201d\u201cThe furthest distance in the world is not when branches cannot depend on each other in the wind. It is when the trajectories of stars cannot cross, even when the blinking stars look at each other.\u201d\u201cThe furthest distance in the world is not when the trajectories of stars cannot cross. It is when they are unable to find each other after crossing trajectories.\u201d\u201cThe furthest distance in the world is not being unable to find each other. It is when we are doomed not to love, even when we coincidentally meet.\u201dThe air turned still and the atmosphere quiet.The deathly feel in the broadcast room suddenly turned gentle.No one had heard of the poem Zhang Ye had said. A few women were even mesmerized by the poem.At the final stanza, which was the critical ending stanza, Zhang Ye used his magnetic tone as a broadcasting host to recite it slowly, \u201cThe furthest distance in the world is the love between the bird and fish. One is flying in the sky, the other is looking upon the sea.\u201dThe furthest distance?Flying bird and fish?This sort of interpretation of distant love was the first time everyone had heard it. Wang Xiaomei\u2019s expression turned complex. The telephone editor was entirely convinced, while Zhao Guozhou and company were deep in thought!This poem had really shocked everyone present!It was a heartfelt shock that came right from within; it was hard to be described with words!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Today I\u2019m giving it you. Is Beijing and New York very far? I do not think so at all. You can still meet again, you can know each other again, you can fall in love again and can be together once again. Are you going to be defeated by this trivial geographical distance? Then your feelings isn\u2019t anything worth mentioning. Lady, don\u2019t use distance as an excuse. Do not use distance to avoid reality. In my opinion, the distance between you isn\u2019t far. Think of the flying bird and think of the small fish. If you are stubborn and insist on being self-righteous, then I will not say another word if you were to slash down with the blade!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThere was complete silence on the other side of the line.Following that, the sound of a girl sobbing could be heard, \u201cFlying bird\u2026and fish\u2026*sob*\u2026Flying bird\u2026and fish\u2026\u201dUpon hearing the sobbing, everyone in the broadcasting room were excited. Previously, she had appeared too calm, but now she had cried? This meant she was moved!The female university student said while sobbing, \u201cTeacher, then\u2026what\u2026should I do?\u201dZhang Ye gave a thought, \u201cI do not know what you should do either. This is your path, so you will need to find your own path.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026*sob*\u2026I don\u2019t know how to walk down the path\u2026\u201d The female university student pleaded for help.Zhao Guozhou, who was behind the glass, gave Zhang Ye an exaggerated gesture! The other Literature Channel staff were also secretly worried. Why can\u2019t you tell her what to do and save her? What do you mean, \u201cYou should find your own path?\u201d What if she wanted to end her path there and then?Wang Xiaomei kicked Zhang Ye in the shin.However, it was as if Zhang Ye did not feel it.The female university student cried, \u201cTeacher, you tell me\u2026what I should do\u2026I trust you\u2026*sob*\u2026I can\u2019t sleep every day\u2026What should I do\u2026Everyday\u2026I\u2019m groggy\u2026at night\u2026I can\u2019t see any future\u2026\u201dWith her crying, Zhang Ye became calm, \u201cLady, I do not have the right or the way to help you decide your own path. Even if we tell you, you might not listen to it. You need to think it through carefully. Let me give you another poem. I hope it can enlighten you somewhat.\u201dAnother poem?The people outside held their breaths again.Zhang Ye said deeply, \u201cThe dark night gave me black eyes, but I use them to seek the light.\u201dAgain, this poem did not exist in this world, but it was famous in Zhang Ye\u2019s world. It was\u00a0Gu Cheng\u2018s \u201cA Generation\u201d. The entire poem only had those two verses. It was very short, but it contained within it a lot of energy. It was difficult to dissect and analyze the meanings within the poem. It could only be said that different people would have different insights. Zhang Ye gave her this poem, hoping she would be enlightened. At least, when Zhang Ye was previously lost, this poem had accompanied him for a long period of time.\u201cThe dark night\u2026gave me black eyes, but I use\u2026them to seek the light.\u201d The female university student repeated it again and slowly stopped crying.Five minutes.Ten minutes.The female university student suddenly spoke, \u201cTeacher Zhang Ye, thank you. I think I know what I should do. I will wait for him. I also want to wait for him. Regardless of the final outcome, I will not try to commit suicide again. Thank you. Your two poems\u2026 I will remember them for life!\u201dZhang Ye said, \u201cI wish you happiness. I also believe a good lady like you will be happy.\u201dThe netizen listeners in front of their computer screens started sending in messages in an explosive manner, breaking all historical records. No number of refreshes were enough to show all of them!\u201cHeavens!\u201d\u201cTeacher Zhang is too good!\u201d\u201cRight, this is the first time I\u2019m seeing a broadcast host who can speak so well!\u201d\u201c\u2019The Furthest Distance in the World\u2019? This poem has too much feeling!\u201d\u201cI think the later poem was the best. The dark night gave me black eyes, but I use them to seek the light. It\u2019s a superb poem, a superb poem for the ages!\u201d\u201cNo wonder he is able to write a divine work like \u201cGhost Blows Out the Light\u201d. I finally understand Teacher Zhang Ye\u2019s artistic standards. It is evidenced by these two poems!\u201d\u201cSaving a life is better than building a seven-storey pagoda. I\u2019ve decided to support and listen to \u201cLate-night Ghost Stories\u201d every day!\u201dWith the situation assuaged, Wang Xiaomei let out a long sigh of relief and quickly said to the listeners, \u201cThank you to everyone listening in to \u2018Talk About the World\u2019. We will meet you again tomorrow at the same time.\u201dWith the transmission cut, the live broadcast ended!Wang Xiaomei slumped into her chair as if she had lost all strength.Zhang Ye gave a wry smile as he touched his neck. He was also covered in sweat. D*mn it, to think I met a suicide situation on my first time being a guest! Can it even get any better!? Thankfully, he had the wisdom of the ancients and managed to somehow convince the lady!The outer door opened as people rushed in.Deputy Station Head Jia was no longer around. Zhao Guozhou was the first to enter and he said loudly, \u201cWell done, Little Zhang! You did beautifully!\u201d\u201cIt was really thrilling!\u201d\u201cIndeed, our Teacher Zhang is talented!\u201dPeople began to admire and praise him!Zhang Ye\u2019s telephone editor, Xiaofang, also gave him a thumbs up from behind the crowd, \u201cTeacher Zhang, those two poems were too great!\u201dWords could kill, but words could equally save. Today, everyone who listened in to the live broadcast learned this. By seeing this all at once, there were a lot of mixed emotions.Wang Xiaomei stood up and daringly said, \u201cLeader, today it was my responsibility. I will accept any punishments the station will mete. I was too provocative in my words.\u201dZhao Guozhou looked at her and did not criticize her, \u201cWrite a self-reflective piece and hand it to me tomorrow. Actually, it is not all your fault. That female university student had already prepared to commit suicide. Even if she did not make the phone call, she would definitely have committed suicide. From another perspective, by us counseling her, it\u2019s also us saving a life. Right, but make sure to be careful in the future. We need to greatly consider the listener\u2019s emotions and capacity to accept. This live broadcast can be said to be a lesson for all of us. It is also a form of experience.\u201dThe matter was done.Everyone let out a sigh of relief.Wang Xiaomei looked towards Zhang Ye, \u201cThose two poems were composed by you?\u201dZhang Ye could not say no. After all, these poems did not exist in this world, \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYou can even compose poems?\u201d Wang Xiaomei found it unbelievable.Zhao Guozhou, who was about to leave, heard this and turned around and laughed, \u201cAll of you might not know how Little Zhang was accepted during the interview, right? It was because of a prose, \u201cThe Song of the Stormy Petrel\u201d. Our entire Literature Channel\u2019s combined efforts probably cannot even match Little Zhang\u2019s artistic talent in poems.\u201d Saying that, he reminiscenced and recited from the beginning. Zhang Ye never expected that Zhao Guozhou would actually be able to recite his poem verbatim. Clearly, he loved the prose so much. \u201c\u2026That is the courageous Petrel proudly soaring in the lightning over the sea\u2019s roar of fury; cries of victory the prophet: Let the tempest come strike harder!\u201dWhen everyone heard this, they were stunned!\u201cGood poem!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s written so well!\u201d\u201cThis poem was also composed on the spot?\u201dEach of these poems was more stunning than the last. Only then did everyone recall what had just happened and an interesting thought arose in their minds. Hipsters were a kind of disease and so were cultured female youths. How could one cure this disease? The answer was simple; use a cultured male youth that was more artistic than the cultured female youth!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Zhang Ye went to the recording studio alone to work overtime. As he did not manage to get a slot to record in the day and the broadcast was delayed by \u201cTalk About the World\u201d at night, he could only record if it was this late. The first few episodes that he had recorded had been depleted over the weekend. So he needed to record \u201cGhost Blows Out the Light\u201d episode for tonight in one and a half hours. Time was tight.\u201cThe grave robbing military officers were working hard. Every corner in any tomb that was dug up had to\u2026Ah, it\u2019s not right!\u201d\u201cA candle was lit up inside any tomb that was dug up and placed on the southeastern corner.\u201d\u201cIf the southeastern candle goes out, then one had to put back the treasures they had gotten, Kowtow three times respectfully and return by the original route.\u201dThis recording session was different from the past. There were stumbles along the way. Zhang Ye was also finding it tough. He never expected that this day would come so soon. Actually, he had previously memorized this book during in his school days to train his off script skills, but he had only done so for the beginning. No matter how good his memory was, he was unable to recite the hundred thousand characters of \u201cGhost Blows Out the Light\u201d. He had only memorized the early portions, so now was the problem. With the material he had memorized back then depleted, he quickly reached spots where he did not remember very well. Although Zhang Ye knew the direction of the plot and knew the details clearly, it was, after all, not the original version. A lot of the time, he had to create his original material. The literature and textual aspects of it were greatly weakened. He still knew where he stood. Clearly, this would definitely seriously affect the listenership rates.Pause. Deleting the paragraph. Re-recording.Only after a long while did he manage to finish it before midnight.He had managed to bamboozle past this for this episode, but he did not know what to do for the next episode. Sigh. If there were problems with quality and the listenership rates dropped, then what would happen!?After finishing his work, Zhang Ye leaned on a window and smoked. The station prohibited smoking, but since there was no one late at night, it did not matter.Ring, ring, ring. Suddenly, his cellphone rang.Zhang Ye was wondering who had called late in the middle of the night. He picked it up, \u201cHello?\u201dThe other party was male, \u201cHello, is this Mr Zhang? I\u2019m Beijing\u2019s repor\u2026\u201dBefore he finished speaking, Zhang Ye thought it was a fraud and said, \u201cI don\u2019t care if you are Beijing or Double. Don\u2019t you dare tell me I hit the lottery. I have already hit the lottery 47 times this year. Including the three BMWs and two Mercedes cars, the total prize money is 12,213,000. Don\u2019t you dare tell me my daughter has been kidnapped. Then you need to help me first find a wife. And don\u2019t you dare tell me you are promoting a ham sausage. Truthfully, I only have 1.50 in my pocket. If I were you, I would hang up immediately and not spend five minutes and manage to take the 1.50 in my pocket to buy your ham sausage after using all your effort. That tiny bit of commission isn\u2019t even enough to pay the telephone bill.\u201d Against frauds and promoters, Zhang Ye was very experienced. \u201cAlright, time for you to speak.\u201dIf it was anyone else who had encountered a hooligan like Zhang Ye, they would have hung up.However, the man on the other side did not. He said in a speechless manner, \u201cI\u2019m not selling Beijing ham. Man, I\u2019m Beijing Time\u2019s reporter. Is this Mr Zhang Ye?\u201dZhang Ye exclaimed, \u201cReporter? Hai, it was a mistake, it was a mistake. I thought it was a scam.\u201dThe man said, \u201cIt\u2019s alright. I got your number through a friend, who works at the radio station. The main reason is because of today\u2019s \u2018Talk About the World\u2019, which I listened in on. Our editing team is very interested about your two poems. We might publish this matter in the papers tomorrow, so we are informing you first. Also, I want to ask about the name of the second poem, as you did not mention it during the broadcast.\u201dZhang Ye was enlightened and, after thinking, said, \u201cThe second poem is called \u2018A Generation\u2019.\u201dThe reporter was amazed, \u201c\u2018A Generation\u2019? This title doesn\u2019t seem to fit?\u201dThe title \u201cA Generation\u201d was actually more fitting for another topic. The original author, Gu Cheng, had intended it for the thoughts and determination of an era and society. When Zhang Ye read it to the female university student, had not adhered to the title\u2019s meaning. It had lacked the great meaning that was so significant. But as Zhang Ye respected the original author and had used the wisdom of the forefathers, how could he then change the poem\u2019s title, too? Cultured youths, oh, cultured youths, when you break down such kind of a person, what is leftover would be stubbornness. Zhang Ye was not an exception; he abided by his principles.So what if it did not fit? He knew the title was different from how he had expressed it tonight, but this was a work by a great poet from his world. A classic ought to be respected, Zhang Ye thought to himself. Even if the author cannot see it, regardless of any reasons, can going against this principle be excused? Going against morality can be excused? The answer was obvious\u2026\u2026Hehe, of course, it\u2019s excusable!Zhang Ye answered \u201cPublish what you feel is suitable. As long as it can be published, you can do whatever you want. I\u2019m fine with it even if you had to give it a dreamy title to increase the sales!\u201d He was a man of principles, but sometimes he was also a man of no principles! This was Beijing Times! It was not the same as the small publication that published reports of \u201cGhost Blows Out the Light\u201d!The reporter nearly vomited blood upon hearing that. He was just freely expressing his thoughts; who would have thought that Zhang Ye had no lower limits? He was a modern poet, an artist who could compose such a classic poem.. yet he would allow his poem\u2019s title be changed so easily? Damn, do you even have the conduct of a scholar!? How could there a scholar like you! The reporter who was astounded, replied with a cough, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean that; I was not implying that you should change the title. It\u2019s better we keep it as \u201cA Generation\u201d; it\u2019s your work, so I can\u2019t be deciding on it.\u201d\u201cAlright, then.\u201d Zhang Ye replied uncaringly.After speaking for a brief while, they hung up.Zhang Ye\u2019s strong point is that he did not have any fear. After the line was cut off, he could no longer suppress his excitement. He was going to be in the Beijing Times? A little more fame had come again! It was another step towards his goal! Oh, right. I should take a look at my Reputation. He opened up the virtual game screen!Reputation points: 95,344.What? Why are there so many points?Zhang Ye was startled. He had just used up all his Reputation points on Saturday morning. According to the Reputation gained from \u201cGhost Blows Out the Light\u201d, there should be around 20,000 gained Reputation points daily. Over the weekend, he had about 40,000 Reputation points. Including the holiday, which might have given him a little more, he should have slightly below 50,000 Reputation points. In short, today\u2019s \u201cTalk About the World\u201d\u2019s live broadcast had brought him over 50,000 Reputation points? This was really worthy of the Literature Channel\u2019s top program! Just the number of listeners were a big difference! Of course, Zhang Ye\u2019s outstanding performance could have helped contribute; the two poems were just right for the circumstances. It must have conquered a lot of listeners!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

How much?\u201d\u201cA dollar.\u201d the owner replied mechanically.Zhang Ye took out some money, \u201cGive me a copy.\u201dThe owner took the money and handed a copy over, \u201cOkay, take it.\u201dZhang Ye, broke as hell, felt bad giving the dollar. But it was unavoidable; money ought to be spent that had to be spent. He held up the paper and flipped through it page by page. When he arrived at the subway and pushed through the crowd at line 10, a sparkle appeared in his eyes. He flipped to the center page, saw his name printed across the page with the headlines especially attention-capturing \u2013 \u201cTwo Poems Saved a Life\u201d!Yesterday night, on Beijing Radio Station\u2019s Literature Channel program \u201cTalk About the World\u201d special, during the call-in session for the \u201cMatters of the Heart\u201d topic, a female university student attempted suicide on the air over her boyfriend\u2019s plans to further his studies in New York. The program host, Wang Xiaomei, attempted to talk her out of it, but failed. In the end, the guest of the show, the Literature Channel\u2019s \u201cLate-night Ghost Stories\u201d host, Teacher Zhang Ye, saved her life with two poems!The dark night gave me black eyes, but I use them to seek the light \u2013 A Generation.The furthest distance in the world is not the distance between opposite sides of the world. It is that you don\u2019t know that I love you, when I stand in front of you\u2026The furthest distance in the world is the love between the bird and fish. One is flying in the sky, the other is looking upon the sea. \u2013 \u201cThe Furthest Distance in the World\u201d, also named \u201cFlying Bird and Fish\u201d.The above are the poems in their original form.According to sources, the two poems were composed on the spot by Teacher Zhang Ye. Our reporter also contacted Teacher Zhang for an interview late last night. Although it was just a phone call, he was awed by Teacher Zhang Ye\u2019s literary talent.Ah?Awed by my literary talent?Zhang Ye blushed a little. He had taken the reporter to be a ham salesman. Literary talent, my ass!The report continued: We have to mention here a side story. At midnight, the editorial department was rushing the report. After seeing the two works, they were moved. An explanation and review of the two poems were done, but when handed over to the head editor for checks, we were held back from publishing it. After reading the poems, his own words were, \u201cDelete all the reviews and analysis. Do not use the old way of writing the report. \u2018Flying Bird and Fish\u2019, a modern poem like this would immediately hit it off with the reader. And the other, \u2018A Generation\u2019, the strength in this cannot be explained by words. This is a great modern poem. Whether or not the author is a rookie, the only word to describe this poem is \u2018Great\u2019. Maybe the author\u2019s fame and current era\u2019s background are not enough to make this poem well-known throughout the world, but I believe time will prove much. A few years or maybe a few decades, or even a few hundreds years down the road, the future generations will remember this poem and remember a person \u2013 Zhang Ye and his \u2018A Generation\u2019. Our generation, their next generation and the future generation of the next generation.\u201dThe review was highly positive. Zhang Ye\u2019s heart fluttered.\u2026Department.\u201cMorning.\u201d Zhang Ye walked into the office.Assistant Xiaofang was the first to welcome him, smiling and revealing her small canine teeth, \u201cTeacher Zhang, you came at the right time. We were just talking about the report in the Beijing Times. Have you seen it?\u201dZhang Ye smiled, \u201cI\u2019ve also seen it.\u201dXiaofang giggled, \u201cPeople were chatting before about it. You are the first person in our Literature Channel to go in the Beijing Times in the recent years.\u201d She was happy for Zhang Ye. \u201cThis is, after all, the Beijing Times. Even though it\u2019s limited to the capital area, the circulation numbers are in the hundreds of thousands. Most people don\u2019t have such a treatment!\u201dThe old host, Teacher Feng, of \u201cOld and Young Story Club\u201d looked over and gave high praises, \u201cTeacher Little Zhang, I heard the rebroadcast last night. I listened to the two poems again and again. Hai, indeed the younger generations will surpass us in time. I\u2019m about to retire soon, so this station will be in the hands of you young people.\u201dZhang Ye quickly said, \u201cIt\u2019s not as serious as you make it out to be. My literary standard is still far from accomplished. I came to the station with a learning attitude. Today, it will still be the same. I\u2019m hoping to receive lots of advice from every Teacher.\u201dTian Bin and Li Si had already came to work.Zhang Ye also noticed him and saw the rage in Tian Bin\u2019s eyes. He was jealous and ignored Zhang Ye, before sitting at his desk. After having Zhang Ye rob the position of main host of \u201cLate-night Ghost Stories\u201d from him, Tian Bin was now a stand-in DJ. He usually did not have any work to do and only stood in when there was a shortage. He had not gone on a program for days, so it wasn\u2019t strange that he was mad.However, Li Si\u2019s attitude today was completely different. It was clear he did not want to speak, but for some unknown reason, he suddenly stopped just as he was about to turn around, \u201c\u2026Teacher Zhang, morning.\u201dZhang Ye looked at him, \u201cOh, morning.\u201dLi Si nodded with his head and then returned to his seat. It seemed like he had given in and had sized up the situation.Seeing this, Tian Bin\u2019s expression turned worse. His popularity was always average amongst his colleagues. Previously, he would often speak about people behind their backs, so it was not strange that he was abandoned by the masses today.Later on, the top celebrity of the station, Wang Xiaomei, came in. She did not look towards Zhang Ye and greeted a few old comrades and friends she had good relations with, before surprisingly saying to Zhang Ye, \u201cTeacher Zhang, quite a number of letters from my program\u2019s listeners were written to you. I will get an assistant to give it to you in a while.\u201d Although her attitude did not seem to change, one had to know that Wang Xiaomei had never privately addressed Zhang Ye as \u201cTeacher Zhang\u201d. A change in salutation clearly showed a subtle form of recognition.Twenty minutes later, Zhang Ye received the letters from the listeners of \u201cTalk About the World\u201d. In the generation where the internet was pervasive, this world was similar to Zhang Ye\u2019s world. Few people wrote letters, but Zhang Ye remained serious about it. Words written on a piece of paper felt more real and sincere.\u201cHello, Teacher Zhang Ye. I heard the program yesterday. I\u2019m also a parent, so I won\u2019t say much. I\u2019ll just thank you for that child\u2019s parents.\u201dThere was a total of 37 letters and all the feedback from the listeners was very positive.Zhang Ye then went through the official e-mail inbox of \u201cLate-night Ghost Stories\u201d. He read every mail sent by the listeners and then read the comments left on Beijing Radio Station\u2019s website. Suddenly, he saw a link and upon clicking it, he realized his \u201cThe Furthest Distance in the World\u201d had been posted on a large discussion forum!There had been 750,000 views!There were more than 3,000 replies!\u201cThis poem is too touching!\u201d\u201cWhy are there so many views? Isn\u2019t this the early stages of going viral!?\u201d\u201cIt has gone viral online, too? When I saw this poem in the Beijing Times in the morning, I was impressed. However, I prefer \u2018A Generation\u2019 more.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a moderator for the literature section on a website and an outright literature lover. I have always liked modern poems and I especially like writing them. I have always thought that I write very well and have left many modern poems in the literature section. However, after seeing Teacher Zhang Ye\u2019s two poems, I now know what it means to be the frog in the well. This is a real modern poem and what I wrote wasn\u2019t!\u201dThere were praises and there were, of course, doubts.\u201cWhat rotten poem is this? It\u2019s just so-so.\u201d\u201cRight, it\u2019s too lame. One moment the furthest distance is this, then the next moment the furthest distance is that. There is no precision!\u201dNo matter how well anything was done, it could not satisfy everyone. Zhang Ye knew this, so when he logged on, he wore an anti-troll fire vest before leaving a message. He did not have any strengths; only his attitude was good and tended to be more peaceful and calm. Seeing all the cursing, he only smiled and had the bearing of a literature writer and great poet.He answered in style, \u201c\u2026I f**k your second granny\u2019s lungs! Just so-so? Do you even f**king know literature? Eh? You dare think lightly of this divine work that can last the ages!? You all are a piece of s**t! A stinking piece of ****!\u201dPeople immediately felt the rush, \u201cEh, why are you cursing?\u201dAnother netizen chimed in, \u201c#3256 is right. All of you don\u2019t understand art!\u201dAnother netizen said, \u201cHow can there be criticisms for a poem this classic? I really don\u2019t understand the aesthetic values of others!\u201d\u201cRight, this is a poem that has saved a life. Still so-so? Then write a poem to save a life for me to see!\u201dUnder Zhang Ye\u2019s lead, those people who had left their negative opinions were drowned by their spit and no longer posted. Seeing the warm enthusiasm, Zhang Ye logged off without his face red or heart throbbing excitedly. He did not feel that he was wretched. This was the attitude a literature writer had!Lao Tze said this before: take actions when the right time comes!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Past 10 A.M., a commotion sounded out outside the Literature Channel\u2019s office area. It was quite loud!\u201cLet us in! I want to find Teacher Zhang Ye!\u201d\u201cThis is an office. This place is restricted for non-staff!\u201d\u201cWe just want to say a few words and leave. We definitely won\u2019t give you trouble!\u201d\u201cThat still will not work. Go to the registration desk and wait for a while. Make an appointment first!\u201dAfter some pushing and shoving, a man and woman squeezed their way in. A security guard was half-heartedly blocking them, which many people could tell. Maybe it was due to a small meeting having just ended, but there were several Music and Traffic Channel staff who were walking past. They were curious over what was happening. Finally, even Zhao Guozhou was startled by this commotion as he came out of his office to probe the issue.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Zhao Guozhou frowned.\u201cThey are adamant about coming in! They refuse to listen to what I have to say!\u201d the security guard explained.\u201cWe want to find Teacher Zhang Ye! Just letting us meet with him once would do! Just once!\u201d the male-female duo shouted.Upon seeing the situation, Zhang Ye had no choice but to stop the work on his hands and squeeze through the crowd, \u201cI\u2019m Zhang Ye. Who are you?\u201dThey rushed up and tightly held Zhang Ye\u2019s hands, \u201cTeacher Zhang! Thank you! Thank you! You are Xiaoli\u2019s benefactor! You are also my benefactor! I want to thank you! Thank you!\u201d As he said this, tears welled up in his eyes. It was not easy for men to cry, so this scene looked odd.Zhang Ye was flabbergasted, \u201cWhat benefactor?\u201dThe quiet girl beside also started crying after seeing her boyfriend cry, \u201cTeacher Zhang, I\u2019m Xiaoli. If it weren\u2019t for the two poems of yours yesterday, I might have\u2026\u201dEveryone immediately had a moment of realization!Zhang Ye also understood, \u201cIt\u2019s you. Is this the boyfriend you mentioned? Don\u2019t cry. All of you, don\u2019t cry!\u201dThe man had tears of remorse, \u201cI only knew about it yesterday night. If you have not persuaded Xiaoli, we would have been separated, forever in different worlds! You are our family\u2019s benefactor!\u201dXiaoli suddenly opened her bag and took out a long red banner, \u201cThis was rushed by my parents to be made overnight.\u201d Her boyfriend stepped forward quickly and pulled it open!Shua!The banner spread out in front of everyone!\u201cGratitude of one speech, in mind for life\u201d!With that, the two of them stood properly and bowed deeply to Zhang Ye!Such a situation moved Zhang Ye greatly as he helped them up, \u201cTo think you went through the trouble. There is really no need to. There is really no need. I didn\u2019t do much. All that matters is if you healthily and safely live on. Hehe, you are not fighting anymore? Have you discussed it well?\u201dThe man bit his lip, \u201cI\u2019ve thought it through; I\u2019m not going overseas!\u201dXiaoli exclaimed, \u201cNo way! Your parents have already arranged it for you!\u201d\u201cWho says one can only be successful in one\u2019s career by studying abroad? I can develop myself domestically, too. I will explain it to my parents. It\u2019s alright, even if they do not agree. I will convince them. I will stay behind and accompany you. Once I graduate, we will get married!\u201d the man said with determination.However, Xiaoli remained resolute, \u201cDefinitely not! You have to go! Even if you don\u2019t want to! I have already thought it through; I will wait for you. I\u2019ll wait for you, no matter how long it takes!\u201d\u201cXiaoli!\u201d The man\u2019s eyes turned red again!Xiaoli gently hugged him, \u201cAs long as you are well, I\u2019ll be fine with anything!\u201dUpon seeing this scene, many people in the office clapped in their hearts. The power of love was always infectious.\u201cIsn\u2019t this good.\u201d Zhang Ye laughed.Zhao Guozhou also said, \u201cNext time, be well. Don\u2019t do something stupid.\u201dXiaoli said embarrassingly, \u201cI won\u2019t. I\u2019m fine as long as he lives well. I will not make him worried ever again.\u201dSuddenly, someone made a suggestion, \u201cTeacher Little Zhang, give them another poem.\u201d\u201cRight, right.\u201d Assistant Xiaofang said, \u201cLet Teacher Zhang give you another poem.\u201dZhao Guozhou also found it interesting, \u201cThis suggestion is good. When you get married, remember to invite Teacher Little Zhang as your marriage witness.\u201dXiaoli was flattered, \u201cHow can I accept it. Teacher Zhang\u2019s words are like gold. I don\u2019t dare to ask for one after he gave me two poems.\u201dZhang Ye touched his nose. With the leader saying that, he had to give a poem, so he said, \u201cAlright. Let me think.\u201dThe Beijing Times had highly appraised and published Zhang Ye\u2019s modern poem, which was proof of his literary prowess. Now that Zhang Ye was about to compose another poem, many people perked up their ears. The staff from other departments who were outside also tried to get in on the action!\u201cDon\u2019t block.\u201d\u201cMove to the side; I can\u2019t see.\u201d\u201cSister Chen, come quickly. There\u2019s another poem.\u201d\u201cWhat poem? Whose poem?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the one from the Literature Channel that went on Beijing Times. That poem is very popular online now.\u201d\u201cThe author of \u2018Flying Bird and Fish\u2019? Wow, then I must listen to it. Wait for me to go in.\u201dMany people squeezed into the large office as nearly a hundred pair of eyes stared at Zhang Ye!Xiaoli and her boyfriend was looking forward to it the most. They did not even bat an eyelid!Zhang Ye never expected the situation to be so grand with so many audience gazing at him. He turned more cautious for he could not embarrass himself with a lousy poem. Well, what poem should I use? Which poem was most appropriate? Zhang Ye recalled a moment, as long as you are well, I\u2019ll be fine with anything? Got it! He slowly spat out his words, \u201cXiaoli, the words you said previously are quite nice. I will use your words as the foundation for the poem I\u2019m giving you.\u201dThe room turned silent.Zhang Ye slowed his breath and recited.\u201cThe passage of time is like water, ever so silent.\u201d\u201cIf you are living well, then the skies are clear\u201dZhao Guozhou immediately applauded, \u201cGood poem!\u201dWhen her boyfriend heard it, he immediately took it down on paper, afraid he would forget it!Xiaoli did not move and closed her eyes, as if revelling in the poem. After a while, she bowed at Zhang Ye once again, \u201cThank you! You are forever my teacher!\u201d\u201cIf you are living well\u2026then the skies are clear?\u201d A female staff member seemed to feel her eyes fog up upon hearing this. It was unknown if she had recalled something or was moved.Wang Xiaomei and Xiaofang also mumbled to themselves and the way they gazed at Zhang Ye was no longer the same. Such a poem affected the feelings of women more. The poem was light and the words were simple, but the overflow of feelings it gave surpassed a thousand words. It was difficult to believe that this poem was the same male composer of \u201cFlying Bird and Fish\u201d. Furthermore, it was composed on the spot!What sort of literary talent was this!Zhang Ye\u2019s single poem completely astonished everyone!Even Tian Bin who was not far away did not say anything. Some people felt that the two poems given to Xiaoli during the broadcast were not composed on the spot by Zhang Ye, and were actually written prior, as they did not believe he was so talented. But now, this poem composed at this moment in time shattered the doubts of many!Actually, this poem was very famous in Zhang Ye\u2019s previous world. It was spread on the internet, especially the last line. There were all sorts of claims about who the original author was. Some said it was Lin Huiyin. Some said it was Lin Huiyin\u2019s dad. Some said it first appeared on the internet and another line was added in the show, \u201cEmpresses in the Palace\u201d. It was not much different from \u201cFlying Bird and Fish\u201d. Zhang Ye treated it as a collective work of predecessors. Anyway, no one in this world had heard of these people. There was no dispute to those poems being his alone!He said it was his?She said it was her dad\u2019s?Then he said it was her third aunt\u2019s?Hai, isn\u2019t that so troublesome and tiring? Putting the controversy to an end, Zhang Ye decided to unify it; this poem is mine. There\u2019s no need to thank me, just call me\u00a0Lei Feng*!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

One could easily hear people discussing about it at any time of the day.\u201cLittle Zhang, you are eating instant noodles again?\u201d The director came in.Zhang Ye hurriedly swallowed the last mouthful and smiled, \u201cYeah, I just need to fill my stomach.\u201dZhao Guozhou asked with concern, \u201cEating like this isn\u2019t healthy. Is it because you are tight on your living expenses, as you haven\u2019t been paid? Hehe, if that is the case, don\u2019t worry about it. I have something to announce in while.\u201d Looking at the office, he said, \u201cIs everyone back from lunch? Then put down what you are working on for a while. As the scene in the morning had wasted some time, well, I\u2019ll be announcing the listenership rates for yesterday.\u201dEveryone looked over.Zhao Guozhou found a seat to sit down, \u201cFirst place, \u201cTalk About the World\u201d. The listenership is\u2026\u201d He purposely dragged out his tone, \u201c4.09%!\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d\u201cIs that true?\u201d\u201cAbove four percent?\u201d\u201cOur rating broke four percent?\u201dIt was clear that Wang Xiaomei was surprised by this.Zhao Guozhou said in a satisfactory manner, \u201cAll these years, Xiaomei\u2019s segment has been our channel\u2019s number one in ratings, but it always averaged around three percent. Everyone, you didn\u2019t hear wrongly. We have really broken four this time. And I can happily tell you that the broadcast \u2018Talk About the World\u2019 yesterday was fourth in the entire station, on average. We are only just behind the News Channel\u2019s two news segment and the Traffic Channel\u2019s \u2018Safe All the Way\u2019. This is an unprecedented result for our channel. Everyone, please congratulate Xiaomei.\u201dThere was applause and cheers!The colleagues were also beaming. If the performance was good, the year-end bonuses would also be multiplied, so it was a joyous occasion for everyone in the Literature Channel.Wang Xiaomei explained, \u201cThank you everyone. However, yesterday was a special case. There is no way that we can maintain it.\u201d She knew why they had jumped from the entire Beijing Radio Station\u2019s 8-9th place to 4th place. After a brief feeling of excitement, she did not say anything else.She wasn\u2019t alone. Zhao Guozhou and the rest were the same. Zhao Guozhou carried on, \u201cI recommend everyone to give Teacher Little Zhang a round of applause. Hehe. Yesterday\u2019s program was all thanks to Teacher Little Zhang; not only did he save us during a crisis, he had also pulled up the rating for \u2018Talk About the World\u2019. Let me announce the rating for \u201cLate-night Ghost Stories\u201d. Last night\u2019s Little Zhang\u2019s segment had an average rating of 1.57%. It ranked third place in our channel and is higher compared to its weekend\u2019s 1.4%. Clearly, last night\u2019s event had led to this. I believe, and I have reason to believe, that under Teacher Little Zhang\u2019s hard work, \u201cLate-night Ghost Stories\u201d will make a new high again. Hence, I have already spoken to the Deputy Directors and Heads and plan to give the 5,000 Yuan bonus award to Teacher Little Zhang. Does anyone have any objections about this?\u201d\u201cNo objections.\u201d\u201cIt is necessary!\u201d\u201cTeacher Little Zhang, congratulations!\u201dZhang Ye pretended to be polite, \u201cLeader, how can I? I\u2019m just a newcomer. And really\u2026\u201dZhao Guozhou beamed with a smile, \u201cIn a while, I\u2019ll let finance enter it into your wages. Do not be like that. It\u2019s what you deserve. Besides, this bonus is also because of another reason. From today onwards, \u201cLate-night Ghost Stories\u201d will have advertising sponsors. As your \u201cGhost Blows Out the Light\u201d has information regarding antiques and its listenership rates have been always high, a large pawn shop business\u2019 public relations staff have contacted the station. The sponsoring negotiations have basically been done. As for the exact numbers, it is still kept under wraps and I cannot divulge it. However, I can roughly tell you that, hehe, about this \u201cLate-night Ghost Stories\u201d sponsorship\u2026 It is about the same as our channel\u2019s prime-time programs\u2019 and is extremely high!\u201dWhat?Almost the same as prime-time programs?When this was revealed, many were dumbfounded. After all, \u201cLate-night Ghost Stories\u201d was a late-night segment. It was worse than late-night programs in the 11 P.M. \u2013 12 A.M. slot. However, the sponsorship it had obtained was nearly the at the level of fees commanded by prime-time segments? Was the advertiser mad? However, it was reasonable once one thought about it. \u201cLate-night Ghost Stories\u201d was no longer a late-night program hosted by Tian Bin. After Zhang Ye took it over, its ratings had an explosive increase. Also, the cohesion rate of the listeners was high. It could be seen from the figures of the listenership breakdown. The pawn shop business was using this relatively specialized and relevant program, which had greatly attracted its listeners, to gain recognition. Hence, this high advertising fee was not unreasonable!\u201cTeacher Little Zhang, you will need to give a treat.\u201d\u201cRight, you must treat. It\u2019s so enviable.\u201d\u201cMy afternoon segment\u2019s sponsorship isn\u2019t even as high as yours. This is such a blow to me. Haha, when our salary is paid, don\u2019t be stingy and treat us all!\u201dThe more advertising sponsorship there was, the greater the cut they would get for their salary. Zhang Ye may be still a rookie whose base salary was inferior to others, but with the addition of the cut of a sponsorship that was nearing the amount for prime-time segments, Zhang Ye\u2019s monthly income would be higher than the older comrades who had had worked in the station for decades!Zhang Ye was also delighted, \u201cSure, sure.\u201dSeeing Zhang Ye\u2019s delighted mood, Tian Bin was so envious that his intestines turned green. He had ran \u201cLate-night Ghost Stories\u201d for years and, on average, it had 300 days a year without sponsorships. Occasionally, there would be a short-term sponsorship, but the fees received were negligible. It was extremely low. This Zhang had only started work for a few days; how was he so lucky? Tian Bin still refused to acknowledge Zhang Ye\u2019s abilities. He was adamant that it was due to luck.After announcing all the programs\u2019 ratings, Zhao Guozhou called Zhang Ye over. He reminded him, \u201cThe advertisers are coming soon. Today is the day we are signing the contract. They, too, want to see your recording situation in person. I have already gotten someone to reserve the recording studio for you. Once they arrive, you can begin. As for the advertisement lines, I haven\u2019t received them. They might bring it and I\u2019ll get someone to pass it to you.\u201dZhang Ye responded, \u201cRecording in the afternoon?\u201d\u201cYes. Anyway, you do not need a script. Why? Is there a problem?\u201d Zhao Guozhou asked.Zhang Ye bit his tongue, \u201cThere\u2019s no problem, Leader. I\u2019ll begin preparing.\u201dZhao Guozhou nodded, \u201cDo well later. Don\u2019t let the advertisers pick fault with it, or there will be questions for the nearly-settled contract.\u201d\u201cI understand. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d Zhang Ye guaranteed.When the Leader left, Zhang Ye\u2019s face turned bitter. No problem, your sister! He had no way of reciting the remaining text of \u201cGhost Blows Out the Light\u201d. He only knew the rough direction to the plot. As he was excited about being in the papers, he had not worked out a draft. He had been planning to work out the draft in the morning, but who could have known that something would happen in the morning? Now, with the advertisers coming in the afternoon, there was definitely no time left. Even if he wanted to go off script, he couldn\u2019t. Ugh, was he going to destroy all the accumulated Reputation in one go? \u201cGhost Blows Out the Light\u201d was difficult to carry on. Was he going to mess up his own program?Bad things were about to happen!The end is near!Thankfully, he had still gotten 5,000 Yuan in rewards. With money, even if he messed up the program, Zhang Ye would be fine. In this world, money is\u2026No, that\u2019s not right!I think I previously said that I treated money like dirt?Let me think for a while, did I say that? Forget it, I don\u2019t think I said that!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Behind him, his assistant, Xiaofang, called out to him.\u201cTeacher Little Zhang.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Xiaofang?\u201d\u201cLeader said to tell you that the sponsor for your program is here.\u201d\u201cEh? So early? Didn\u2019t they say noon?\u201d\u201cEr, it\u2019s noon now. This is for you; it\u2019s the advertisement copy. The recording studio is also ready. The director wants you to get ready before he brings over the guests.\u201dDamn, this time I\u2019m done for!Zhang Ye had only just typed out the words for \u201cGhost Blows Out the Light\u201d, without any structure or thought. He could only switch off his computer and go do the undoable at the recording studio.Sometimes, the one who knows you best is your enemy. That is a very true saying. Tian Bin keenly noticed Zhang Ye\u2019s abnormal actions and linked it to the quality drop in the recent two broadcasts of \u201cLate-night Ghost Stories\u201d, where stuttering and the wrong usage of words occurred frequently. Even the recording took longer; where it used to take an hour, it took about 1.5 hours to 2 hours to finish a recording now. Tian Bin guessed that Zhang Ye has reached a creative bottleneck or it was even possible that the novel had a problem. Looking at him now, it was obvious that he had no script for it. Haha, this kid is getting what he deserves. The story won\u2019t be able to continue on from here? I\u2019ll see how you get past this! Tian Bin was over the moon. He stood up and proceeded to the recording studio, ready to see Zhang Ye make a mockery of himself and get what he deserved!\u2026Recording Studio 1.This was the most prestigious studio in the station. It was bigger than the other studios by at least three times. This did not even include the outside of the studio. There was a small space outside of the studio where the telephone editor worked and on the other side there was a viewing hall. It had a transparent soundproof glass which did not block the view, space for 30 leather chairs on the inside and even a small conference table. The station obviously prepared this place for the advertisers who had a sizeable sponsorship. Otherwise, this sort of a studio was usually only reserved for off-site interactive activities or management inspection use.It was a situation of great importance!And the pressure was greater, too!Zhang Ye went in with the equipment settings readied by a staff member who informed him about the differences between this studio and the others before leaving. Zhang Ye was now alone in the room and felt like he was sitting on a cushion of needles. He mumbled to himself, \u201cWhat should I do?\u201d Bullshit my way through this? That won\u2019t work. The clients were willing to sponsor him because they have heard his program before. Just opening his mouth would let the cat out of the bag. Besides, the listeners would definitely not agree to it. Narrating while coming up with and organizing his thoughts? But he didn\u2019t have that capability; even if he hurriedly composed, the quality would be bad! All his ideas had been exhausted, Zhang Ye could do nothing more. He only hoped that the client would not tear up the contract.Outside.Viewing hall.\u201cIt\u2019s over here. Please, come in.\u201d The door creaked and then Zhao Guozhou and a deputy led five to six men and women in. \u201cLet\u2019s have a seat. Someone will get you tea.\u201dA woman said, \u201cDirector Zhao, you are too welcoming of us.\u201dAnother person looked through the glass at Zhang Ye, \u201cIs that Teacher Little Zhang?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Zhao Guozhou smiled, \u201cLet Little Zhang start; we will listen and discuss at the same time.\u201d\u201cSure. I am a loyal fan of \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019. I even listened to the program late last night. I\u2019m honoured to be listening live on-site today.\u201d a middle-aged man mentioned politely.They sat at the first row next to the location. They were from the Hua Tian Group, operators of pawn shops, jewelry shops and some auction house businesses. Zhang Ye did not know them from his world; the closest to it that he knew of was the Hua Xia Group\u2019s pawn shop businesses. Seemingly, even pawn shop businesses were altered in this world. Maybe the sponsored amount this time was too high. The contract duration was also longer than usual, not like those of a week or half a month. Because of this, this leading corporation gave the deal more attention. Five to six people from the marketing department, leaders and staff included, came over to discuss the contractual details. Likewise, Zhao Guozhou also had his own entourage. Wang Xiaomei and several other radio host Teachers also came along. The last to join was Tian Bin and he was probably uninvited. But as there were no restrictions on the attendees, the Leaders did not mention it.After settling down, Zhao Guozhou signaled to Xiaofang with his index finger.Understanding his intention, Xiaofang also signalled towards Zhang Ye in the studio and did a countdown from ten. After so many broadcast sessions, the two of them could communicate with just gestures. Li Si was the previous assistant for \u201cLate-night Ghost Stories\u201d. Xiaofang was an assistant to everyone, also known as a helper to all. After Zhang Ye arrived, with the popularity of his program, Xiaofang became his personal assistant. Her previous tasks were all handed over to other assistants, while she concentrated on her job for \u201cLate-night Ghost Stories\u201d. She was part of Zhang Ye\u2019s program team.By now, Zhang Ye had to step up. With a deep breath, he pushed a button. 3, 2, 1. The broadcast started with the opening, \u201cHello, everyone. I am your DJ, Zhang Ye. Welcome to today\u2019s \u201cLate-night Ghost Stories\u201d. Casually stating the chapter\u2019s title, Zhang Ye started reading the story.As he spoke, the others were discussing outside.\u201cThe contract has been prepared. Please take a look?\u201d Zhao Guozhou went straight for the subject.The woman who looked like she was the leader of the group said, \u201cDirector Zhao, it\u2019s okay if you are busy and need to attend to your work. Let\u2019s not rush this. We would like to listen in, first.\u201d\u201cAlright. Of course.\u201d Zhao Guozhou said.The women enquired curiously, \u201cOh, yes. I see\u2026 That Teacher, Little Zhang, does not have a script?\u201dZhao Guozhou smiled a little, \u201cThat\u2019s right. This is also a specialty of our program. Little Zhang has never needed a script. He\u2019s always working off-script for the program.\u201d\u201cThat can\u2019t be true?\u201d the women said skeptically.Several of the people in the pawn shop business group also felt that they were exaggerating.In the studio, Zhang Ye read, \u201cThe fatty had a piece\u2026.a jade heirloom that he always had with him. This piece of jade belonged to a\u2026a northwestern army\u2019s\u2026\u201d Before he could finish a line, Zhang Ye already could not carry on. With his brain trying to organize his words and also trying to recall the plot\u2019s direction, it was beyond his abilities.Eh? What\u2019s the matter with Little Zhang today? Zhao Guozhou finally realized something was wrong with Zhang Ye!Tian Bin had realized this beforehand and was laughing at him on the inside. He was gleefully awaiting to see the joke that was Zhang Ye. This was the purpose of his attendance.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cEh? Why did he stop?\u201dThe clients looked at each other blankly, not understanding the situation.Zhang Ye disguised his situation with a cough, switched off his recording, \u201cLet\u2019s re-record this portion. I apologize. My throat is a little unwell, let me get some water.\u201dZhao Guozhou looked at him, then spoke to him through the intercom, \u201cDidn\u2019t sleep well last night? Don\u2019t worry, please rest for a few minutes.\u201d To help Zhang Ye smooth out the situation, Zhao Guozhou branched out the conversation and spoke to the clients about other topics.Xiaofang had a face full of worry!Zhang Ye\u2019s colleagues also had looks of suspicion!A lot of the others had the same feeling from two days ago. Zhang Ye\u2019s story did not sound smooth. The novel\u2019s quality had dropped and there were stumbles in the story plot. Everyone wondered, \u201cWas Zhang Ye a prodigy that has wilted? Is it that the story cannot continue on? Why did it have to happen at this moment?\u201d The sponsors were here today to sign the contract, so if any mistakes happened, then all that sponsorship money would go up in smoke. Zhang Ye would then have to bear the responsibility and this would also be a smudge on their Literature Channel\u2019s reputation!A lot of people held their breaths for Zhang Ye.Only Tian Bin had a different expression from the rest. He only wished that Zhang Ye would make a mistake. If \u201cGhost Blows Out the Light\u201d really could not go on, then there would be no need for Zhang Ye\u2019s existence. Ignoring the fact that he would be cursed at by the listeners, the Leaders would not agree to it. Even though over the years, \u201cLate-night Ghost Stories\u201d had stories that were cut short, as they had poor ratings, none of them had been dropped midway. There would always be a simple finale to the stories. If Zhang Ye could not produce a story today, then it would be a broadcast incident and nobody could save him!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 28": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I\u2019m Really a SuperstarCH 27Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 27: Getting a Big Prize in the Lottery!He only had a few minutes to rest.Inside the recording studio, Zhang Ye was sweating profusely. He was really worried. No matter how he racked his brains, it was to no avail. Right, there was still one last lifeline!The Lottery!He could only place his only hope on the game ring. He should still have the ability to have a chance at the Lottery. Whether he could ride out this storm depended on the outcome of the Lottery. Maybe he could draw an item that gave people mass hallucinations? Maybe an item that could rapidly increase his creative composition of words? Success or failure depended on this! Zhang Ye could only go for broke as he opened the game ring\u2019s virtual interface and checked his Reputation score.Reputation points: 305,931.Upon seeing this number, Zhang Ye was dumbfounded. It took a while before he understood how his Reputation points had increased so much. The first reason was the addition of Reputation points from Xiaoli\u2019s suicide matter from the previous night. The program \u201cTalk About the World\u201d was also uploaded onto the internet. The second reason was the 30,000+ Reputation points obtained from the previous day\u2019s \u201cLate-night Ghost Stories\u201d. With the rating improving by the day, there were more and more Reputation points gained every day. The third reason was, of course, due to the Beijing Times report today. This was a major newspaper that had a circulation rate of a few hundred thousand in the capital. Even if half of those who had bought the papers had read Zhang Ye\u2019s news and only a half of those half had marveled at the two poems or were impressed by how Zhang Ye used the modern poems to save a life, that was sufficient to add more than a hundred thousand Reputation points. Exposure, achievements and fame added to his Reputation points.Great!The Reputation points were enough for him to draw three times at the Lottery!Zhang Ye tapped the \u201cLottery\u201d purchase button and began his first attempt at the Lottery. The needle began moving as he chanted, \u201cPlease not something from the Consumption Category! Not a Consumption Category item!\u201d No one could see the virtual game interface in reality, so he was not worried about it.But he was born unlucky!The needle firmly stopped itself in a Consumption Category region!Bada, a Treasure Chest (Small) appeared in his inventory. Zhang Ye helplessly took out the treasure chest and placed it on the floor. Avoiding the gaze of others, he opened the chest. There was a little circular band. It looked like the halo band seen above angels in movie productions. The only difference was that the color was black.[ Unlucky Halo ] : Effective once it is worn. Lasts for 5 minutes. Triggering specific conditions will cause those around the player to enter a state of bad luck.What does this mean? It has the same effect as the Unlucky Sticker? Only that it\u2019s an \u201carea of effect\u201d type this time? What were the conditions? It won\u2019t be attacking indiscriminately, right?Zhang Ye did not study it much and first stuffed the Lottery item into his game ring. Following that, he puffed on his palm a few times. It was too depressing. What sort of sh*t hands were these? He had drawn from the Lottery four times, since he magically obtained the game ring. However, every time it was a Consumption Category treasure chests. Even though the Consumption Category region took up the largest proportion on the wheel, it shouldn\u2019t happen all the time, right? At least let me see what Stats Category and Skills Category are. The probability of hitting the Special Category was too low, so he did not have any hopes for it, but the Stats and Skills Categories still had a non-trivial probability of hitting them!Again!I don\u2019t believe it!Zhang Ye frowned as he breathed in like he was practicing qigong. After messing around for a while, he spent another 100,000 Reputation points to buy a chance at the Lottery, despite his painful heart!He clicked on the Lottery!The needle began moving again!It was all random. At least, Zhang Ye still could not see any pattern up until now. He could only stare and chant, waiting for the needle to slow down before he could see what it was! Skills Category! Stop! Stop! Aiyah, it did not stop! Another Consumption Category! Quickly get past it! Just a bit more! The needle was obedient this time as it grinded forward by a bit! Move some more! Move some more! It\u2019s not enough! Almost got it! As Zhang Ye eagerly watched as the needle seemed to use all its strength before stopping, it suddenly moved that tiny bit as its final rally!Click!Special Category!It had actually stopped at the Special Category region, which had a 1-2% chance of being picked!The Heaven\u2019s have shined their light on me; I managed to get a grand prize! Zhang Ye was finally delighted. The time for the Lottery to give out its prize had come. There was no item to receive, nor was there a treasure chest to be opened. There was just a system message.Special Category awarded: Opening the Merchant Shop, adding the right to purchase item, \"Memory Search Capsule\".After that, the virtual game\u2019s interface for the Merchant Shop opened. When he clicked it open, there was an item inside.Memory Search Capsule: Effective upon consuming it. Helps the player search a memory or subconscious memory and permanently reinforces it. Lasts for five minutes. Costs 100,000 Reputation points.Zhang Ye still remembered the Special Category\u2019s introduction. It was written that it would allow the purchase of a certain item. It seemed like the method to obtain magical items was not just limited to the luck of the draw. He could also use the random chance from landing on the Special Category to give him the right to buy an item. He could buy an unlimited number of the items in the Merchant Shop, as long as he had the Reputation points. He would no longer be restricted to the limitations of the random chance in the Lottery. This discovery made Zhang Ye excited!Memory search?Could this solve the problem he was facing?Time was running out, so Zhang Ye didn\u2019t spend too much time thinking about it. He looked at the remaining 100,000 Reputation points he had left and decided against the Lottery. He could not afford it. As such, he opened the Merchant Shop and spent 100,000 Reputation points to buy one \u201cMemory Search Capsule\u201d. He only had a few thousand Reputation points left as a result.Ding!With the successful purchase, the item automatically entered his inventory!Zhang Ye quickly opened up his inventory and, with a grab, pulled out a black and white capsule. It looked like something one ate when one had the cold. Gritting his teeth, he swallowed it. As he crunched on it, he felt his eyes go blank before he could even decide on its taste. His brain\u2019s activity suddenly increased, as several scenes flashed before his eyes. Zhang Ye was filled with worry about the \u201cGhost Blows Out the Light\u201d script, so all his thoughts were focused on it. So with a thought, the scenes in his brain suddenly jumped to the scene of him back in school in his previous world. It was the weekend when Zhang Ye had just bought the entire \u201cGhost Blows Out the Light\u201d set after school. It had books written in simplified script. The moment he reached home, he excitedly flipped through them to read it!One page\u2026Ten pages\u2026Twenty pages\u2026It was all scenes of him flipping through the books. It was as fast as a movie playing!At this moment, the effective duration of the \u201cMemory Search Capsule\u201d ended. Zhang Ye returned to reality from his weird memories. Only five minutes had passed in reality, precisely the effective duration of the item. However, the speed at which he thought was clearly much faster. The concept of time was completely different. In his memories, Zhang Ye seemed to have spent several hours reading. With a blink, Zhang Ye was delighted to discover that after reliving those memories of reading \u201cGhost Blows Out the Light\u201d, every word in the novel was remembered by him clearly. He could recite them from memory easily! The Memory Search had helped him dig out buried memories and had reinforced those memories! Although the Memory Search did not completely let him recall the hundreds of thousands of words in \u201cGhost Blows Out the Light\u201d, it had reinforced about a quarter of the content in his memories. Previously, Zhang Ye had only narrated about tens of thousands of content during the earlier segments. Hence, with his current memories, he could easily narrate another 200,000 words with his eyes closed!It\u2019s done!There\u2019s no need to worry about the script anymore!This item had come at an opportune moment! Besides, as long as he had enough Reputation points, he could buy an unlimited number of Memory Search Capsules. There would no longer be any worry about trying to recall artistic works from his previous life!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

On the other side of the glass, Zhang Ye saw her, too. He cleared his throat. He had seen this woman before and she had cursed him behind his back. She was Tian Bin\u2019s wife. He met on the first day of work. The woman was holding a contract in her hand. Clearly, she was one of the staff in the station. Either she was in charge of advertisement matters, or she was in charge of contractual laws. He had previously thought that Tian Bin\u2019s wife had come to meet Tian Bin to get off work together. So his wife was also a member of the radio station.\u201cDirector Zhao, the contract.\u201d The woman took out a bunch of A4 paper.Zhao Guozhou took it over and acknowledged, \u201cJust leave it here. We\u2019ll speak later.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d The woman leaned her head to the side to look around. Seeing Tian Bin waving towards her, she walked to the last row and sat with her husband.\u201cSister-in-law.\u201d\u201cSis, you came?\u201dPeople in the Literature Channel knew of the duo\u2019s relation, as everyone knew each other.After sitting down, Tian Bin\u2019s wife did not hide her disdain for Zhang Ye as she whispered, \u201cWhy hasn\u2019t it started? What are we waiting for?\u201d How could her tone be good, when her husband was replaced by Zhang Ye?A Literature Channel staff member said, \u201cIt began a while ago, but it seems like Teacher Zhang\u2019s throat isn\u2019t good, so it was stopped.\u201dTian Bin laughed quietly, \u201cIt\u2019s not his throat isn\u2019t good. He can\u2019t produce anything. If you don\u2019t believe me, just watch. His advertising sponsorship will definitely be blown off today!\u201d\u201cThat can\u2019t be?\u201d another colleague said.Tian Bin seethed, \u201cHaven\u2019t you already noticed? Zhang Ye is already a spent force. He has nothing left sustaining him. How do you explain it?\u201dTian Bin\u2019s wife laughed, \u201cI think so, too. A rookie can\u2019t have good luck all his life. He has to pay the price of being young. How can being a host be so easy? Only after a few years of grinding and being beat down would one gain acceptance. A moment of impressiveness is just short-lived. In the end, what matters is experience and background!\u201dWhen Xiaofang heard this, she was very unhappy, but she did not dare to show it. After all, she was a rookie, so she could only say, \u201cTeacher Zhang will be fine!\u201dTian Bin lost his smile, \u201cDoes his performance look like he is fine? Then let\u2019s have a bet? Let\u2019s see if he can pass this ordeal!\u201dXiaofang remained silent. She was afraid, too. Teacher Zhang, you must not make any mistakes!\u2026What they said could not be heard in front, as there was a distance of seven meters separating them.\u201cLittle Zhang! Have you rested your throat?\u201d Zhao Guozhou could no longer drag it out any longer. Seeing so much time pass, he could only ask with a frown.Zhang Ye adjusted his bearings as he drank some water. He immediately said, \u201cLeader, I can do it.\u201d\u201cAlright, then let\u2019s carry on.\u201d Zhao Guozhou waved at him to begin, while his eyes seemed unsure.Tian Bin was thinking in his mind, \u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018you can do it\u2019. Today, I\u2019m just waiting for you to make a fool of yourself. When you fail, the segment \u2018Late-night Ghost Stories\u2019 will be mine again!\u201dTian Bin\u2019s wife also laughed in silence. She, too, was waiting for Zhang Ye to make a fool of himself!Zhang Ye paused for two seconds before he began recording, \u201cHello, everybody. Welcome to today\u2019s \u201cLate-night Ghost Stories\u201d segment\u2026 This piece of jade was given to his father by a chief in the northwestern army. Years ago, this chief had led his troops to destroy a gang of bandits. This piece of jade was worn closely by the bandit leader. Although it was a piece of jade, its shape did not look anything like it. Its shape was strange\u2026\u201d Zhang Ye was no longer like the stammering Zhang Ye from before. His words were buttery smooth!Tian Bin was surprised a little. What the heck? How could he now narrate again? Oh, he must have used the break time to organize his thoughts. However, what could that little bit of time amount to? He will end up full of mistakes later!Ten minutes!Half an hour!Time passed.Tian Bin was looking forward to seeing Zhang Ye make a mistake. The married couple were waiting to see a show.However, Zhang Ye\u2019s performance made their faces turn green. Not only did Zhang Ye not make a single mistake, the plot and words used were excellent. It had returned to the high quality standard of the first few episodes. It was even better than the first few episodes. There was not a single re-recording of a passage. It was as if he had God\u2019s help, as he chattered on!\u201cAccording to Eiko, the Savages Ditch by Hei Feng Kou was actually previously called Corpses Ditch. Further into the past, it was actually called Moon Holding Ditch\u2026\u201dOne episode was done!Two episodes were done!From 2 P.M. in the afternoon to 5 P.M. in the afternoon, Zhang Ye recorded three full episodes. There was no break in between. He did not even take a mouthful of water. He had recorded it all in one go!The Tian Bin couple were terrified!Zhao Guozhou and Xiaofang were stunned with their mouths agape!The five-member advertising sponsorship team was also dumbfounded!When the third episode was done recording, Zhang Ye still seemed addicted to it and was just about to carry on recording another episode. Zhao Guozhou quickly interrupted upon seeing this. He switched on the microphone to contact him, \u201cLittle Zhang, that will do. Come over here, first!\u201d You still want to narrate some more? You still can narrate? Any more, and the sky will turn dark!Zhang Ye said, \u201cYes.\u201d before taking off his headset, with lingering feelings.The pawn shop business\u2019 woman stared while saying, \u201cThe three hours of content was said without script? That\u2019s impossible!\u201d She would not believe it even if she was killed. She immediately stood up, \u201cI\u2019m going in to take a look!\u201d She hated being deceived by others. It would be a great disrespect towards them and also an insult to their intelligence!\u201cAh\u2026\u201d Zhao Guozhou did not stop them, allowing to do so.The Tian Bin couple also did not believe it and they accompanied the sponsors and the Leader in.Three hours of on-the-spot creation, without any mistakes or script?How did he do it!? This must be an international joke!Immediately, a group of people poured into the recording studio as they looked all around. They really could not find a script. A sponsor guessed that Zhang Ye had copied the script into the computer; as such, he looked at the monitor. Good rascal. The recording studio\u2019s second computer was not even switched on. And the main computer was controlled with buttons. There wasn\u2019t even a display!Zhang Ye was wondering why so many people rushed in, \u201cEh? What\u2019s the matter?\u201dThe sponsors were amazed, \u201cYou\u2026you really did not use a script?\u201d\u201cNope. I just said what I have on the spot.\u201d Zhang Ye answered matter-of-factly.The woman did not utter a word for a long while, before turning her head towards Zhao Guozhou, \u201cLet\u2019s sign the contract, Director Zhao. We are convinced!\u201dOnly Tian Bin remained in disbelief. Your sister! How did you memorize three hours worth of content? Are you f**king mad? Ignoring it being off script, even when Tian Bin recorded with a script, he would also make mistakes. How the f**k do you not have any mistakes without a script? How could it be!? Aren\u2019t you on the brink of death? Weren\u2019t you unable to narrate the story, just now? How did you seem to transform suddenly!?Tian Bin\u2019s wife\u2019s expression looked ugly, too.Assistant Xiaofang glanced at them. You still want to bet that Teacher Zhang can\u2019t do it? Why aren\u2019t you speaking now? Are you dumb now?It was natural that Zhang Ye would not make a mistake. His memories had been strongly reinforced. It could be blurted out without thinking. This was the effect of the memory capsule!Zhao Guozhou and the sponsors left to discuss the details of the contract.Zhang Ye looked at his watch. He still was not done with his narration itch. He felt that his mental state was still very good. So he decided to forgo his meal. After drinking a mouthful of water, he returned to the recording studio and began rattling off the fourth episode for the day!Tian Bin refused to have his beliefs shaken. He insisted on staying behind to see how Zhang Ye managed it!Wang Xiaomei and a few other hosts did not go for dinner. They, too, wanted to see what tricks Zhang Ye had; rather, it should be said that they wanted to know what Zhang Ye\u2019s limit was. They were extremely surprised!Four episodes!Six episodes!Eight episodes!Zhang Ye actually recorded from two in the afternoon to ten in the evening!Wang Xiaomei had already left silently at 6pm!Tian Bin endured past 7 PM before going home with an ashen face!There were people who went for their dinner midway. Some people got off work, while some people came to catch a glimpse of this spectacle after hearing about it!\u201cHe\u2019s amazing!\u201d\u201cQuick, go take a look. Zhang Ye is still recording!\u201d\u201cAh? What time is it? And it was done without a script?\u201d\u201cOf course it is done without a script. Damn! He has gone off script for eight hours!\u201d\u201cHoly shit! Is that guy still human? Did he eat some power pills?\u201dThe news quickly spread. Many hosts and staff from other channels came in waves. Everyone came to listen with a look of disbelief. However, when all of them left, their looks of disbelief were replaced by looks of amazement, without exception!After that day.Everyone knew that a man of God had arrived in the Literature Channel!He was a person who had produced a work on the spot, recording without any script for more than ten hours without a mistake! If the entire station was added up\u2026 Who dared to compare with him!?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 30": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I\u2019m Really a SuperstarCH 29Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 29: What is Your Most Expensive Dish Here?A week later.Zhang Ye had been forcefully given leave by a Deputy Director for the Literature Channel. The Leader nearly pleaded with him to take a break for two days with a confused expression of being at a loss over whether to laugh or cry. Why? This was because Zhang Ye was playing with his life for the entire week. Every day, he would reserve the recording studio during the day. If he could not get a long time slot, he would reserve a time slot at night. He would obtain the key from the relevant personnel to work overtime throughout the night. He had completely recorded the fifty episodes of \u201cGhost Blows Out the Light\u201d. Together with the episodes recorded before, he had finished recording more than 60 episodes. The book was almost done.In between, the episodes that were periodically broadcast gave Zhang Ye a total of 200,000 Reputation points. The few poems that spread online also kept contributing to his Reputation score. All of them added up to about 300,000 points. Zhang Ye used those points to buy three \u201cMemory Search Capsules\u201d. They allowed Zhang Ye to reinforce the text in \u201cGhost Blows Out the Light\u201d. Without a missing word, he could naturally record without a hitch. As usual, he went off-script during the entire process. In seven days, everyone in the station was used to this \u201cwarped\u201d existence.From shock to amazement, from amazement to surprise, and from surprise to numbness!In the end, everyone took Zhang Ye\u2019s stunning performance for granted!There were only a few episodes left before Zhang Ye finished recording. In Zhang Ye\u2019s original world, a radio station had recorded the audio version of \u201cGhost Blows Out the Light\u201d after its crazy sales. It was done in 400-500 episodes, so how did he finish recording in less than 100 episodes? This was because, in his previous world, the ghost story segment was called \u201cMidnight Strange Files\u201d. It was half an hour long. Only about 20 minutes, or even less, of the novel was narrated during the segment. However, in this world, \u201cLate-night Ghost Stories\u201d was a segment that was an hour long. Furthermore, Zhang Ye\u2019s narrative speed was much faster than the average person\u2019s. As a result, the number of episodes were naturally reduced.\u2026In the morning.Zhang Ye was washing up. The seven days of continuous work and disruptive working schedule had affected his mental state. Even while smoking to refresh himself, he would keep yawning.There was actually no need for him to work so hard.But why did Zhang Ye work so hard? There were four reasons.Firstly, he needed to be worthy of the Leader\u2019s appreciation!Secondly, he needed to be worthy of the audience\u2019s love!Thirdly, if he finished recording the program early, he could get a bonus!As for the fourth reason\u2026Well, the fourth reason is that the first and second reasons were not important at all!After checking his salary and bonus online, Zhang Ye immediately cheered up. After realizing that he had not been home for a long while, he went down to take the subway as he headed to his parents\u2019 home.His parents lived in Caishikou, a small neighborhood in Beijing that was neither young or old.Just as he arrived, Zhang Ye met a few of his old neighbors.\u201cEh, isn\u2019t this Little Ye? You are back? I haven\u2019t seen you in a long while.\u201d an auntie said.Zhang Ye greeted, \u201cGood morning, Auntie Zhou. I moved out to stay alone a month ago. I\u2019ve been busy working recently, so I didn\u2019t come back.\u201d\u201cI heard from your parents that you are working at a radio station?\u201d Another old uncle flapped a paper fan as he said, \u201cThat is a good place. It\u2019s paid by the public, so do well.\u201d\u201cOkay. Sure.\u201d Zhang Ye went up after making some idle chat.After pressing the doorbell, it was his mother who opened the door. She did not look happy, \u201cIt\u2019s been a month. Now you know to return home?\u201dZhang Ye gave a glance and gave an obsequious smile, \u201cI was waiting to return only after having some success. Where\u2019s dad? He isn\u2019t working today, right?\u201d\u201cHim? He\u2019s reading the papers.\u201d Mom kicked a pair of slippers to her son.Zhang Ye bent over and wore them. Upon entering the living room, he saw his dad sitting on the sofa, reading Beijing Times. \u201cDad, I\u2019m back. How\u2019s your and Mom\u2019s health?\u201dDad never said much, \u201cIt\u2019s good. How\u2019s work?\u201dZhang Ye seemed happy, \u201cIt\u2019s good. This month\u2019s salary has been paid. Together with the bonus, it\u2019s a total of 18,000.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Mom\u2019s ears immediately perked up. She turned from sorrow to joy, \u201cWhy is there so much? Aren\u2019t you in your probation period? You shouldn\u2019t have established yourself, right?\u201dZhang Ye smiled, \u201cThe wage isn\u2019t a lot, but the bonus is quite a lot. There is a 5,000 contribution reward and another 8,000 performance award. With my wage and benefits added together, that\u2019s why I was paid so much.\u201d\u201cMy son sure is good.\u201d Mom beamed, \u201cI already said my son will amount to something!\u201dDad said squarely, \u201cDon\u2019t be arrogant. This little bit of results isn\u2019t anything.\u201dMom squinted at Zhang Ye and pursed her lips, \u201cHear what your Dad is saying. Every night, he will listen to your program in front of the radio. Sometimes he would not even agree to lowering the volume when I find it noisy. That episode where you used a modern poem to save a girl? He also listened to it. He even praised your modern poem\u2019s standard. He even recorded those few poems down. Heh. Anyway, I didn\u2019t understand that poem of yours.\u201dDad\u2019s expression changed, \u201cMust you say so much?\u201dMom snorted, \u201cI\u2019m just speaking the truth. What are you staring for? Do you think only your staring eyes are the biggest?\u201dZhang Ye chuckled. The approval of his family was his greatest encouragement. He said, \u201cIt\u2019s almost noon. Mom, Dad. There\u2019s no need to cook today. Let\u2019s go out and eat. Since this is my first hard-earned wage, I must treat you to a good meal. Let\u2019s go!\u201dMom said happily, \u201cAlright. I want to enjoy my son\u2019s treat.\u201dDad was about to say something, such as don\u2019t be a spendthrift, as their living conditions were not that great. However, with Zhang Ye and Mom pulling him, Dad eventually went to change.Downstairs.Mom pulled out her cellphone like an avant-garde. \u201cLet me check what good restaurants there are nearby.\u201dZhang Ye asked, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m checking the reviews online. I just learned about it from my colleagues.\u201d Mom began to clumsily maneuver through her cellphone\u2019s functionality.Zhang Ye scoffed and looked down on Mom, \u201cOnline reviews? You are too passe. What year is it now? What you are doing isn\u2019t scientific nor precise. Look at me!\u201d Zhang Ye took out a signing pen that he always brought along and threw it into the air. After the pen dropped to the ground, he pointed along the direction of the pen tip to a street diagonally across. \u201cThat restaurant has delicious food!\u201dMom, \u201c\u2026\u201dDad said, \u201cAs a college graduate, can you not be so superstitious?\u201dZhang Ye stubbornly said, \u201cBelieve me. That restaurant definitely is good. I\u2019ve never been wrong with throwing stuff \u2013 or else, how do you think I scored such a high score during my English college entrance exams?\u201dThe restaurant was not small and there were quite a number of people.The trio were led to a table in the back by a waiter.A waitress politely said, \u201cWhat do the three of you want to eat?\u201dMom said casually, \u201cSon, you do the ordering, but don\u2019t order things that are too expensive. It is unnecessary.\u201dZhang Ye acknowledged. With almost 20,000, he was now a little tycoon. What was the use in having so much money? Isn\u2019t it meant to be used? Furthermore, he was now a public figure. He needed to maintain his reputation, so he said with confidence, \u201cWhat is your most expensive dish here?\u201dThe waitress said with a surprise, \u201cThe most expensive?\u201dZhang Ye nodded, \u201cRight. Feel free and say it boldly!\u201dThe waitress answered, \u201cDeep-Fried Mandarin Fish is quite expensive. And depending on the portion, a fish can cost about 300 after preparation. Right, we also have abalone. One portion is 120. How many portions do you want?\u201dZhang Ye snapped his fingers, \u201cGood, very good. Give me\u2026a plate of Kung Pao chicken, a plate of Shredded Pork with Garlic Sauce and three bowls of rice. That would be all!\u201dThe waitress nearly vomited out blood. After all that she said, he did not want any of that?After the waitress left, Mom embarrassingly said, \u201cWhy did you ask about all of that!?\u201dZhang Ye coughed, \u201cI never expected it to be so expensive. Also, didn\u2019t you say not to order stuff that\u2019s too expensive? We still need to live. So we shouldn\u2019t be too extravagant.\u201dMom said angrily, \u201cYou are too cheap!\u201dDad interjected, \u201cIsn\u2019t that something he learned from you? You mother-son duo were born money-faced!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After logging in to his newly registered\u00a0Weibo* account, there was a verified label on his avatar. This was a verified account that the radio station had applied for him, for work purposes. The verification details were, \u201cBeijing Radio Station\u2019s Literature Channel\u2019s \u2018Late-night Ghost Stories\u2019 Broadcast Host Zhang Ye\u201d. Every radio anchor host had a platform to communicate with their audience. By promoting their programs and maintaining their image, that was also a part of their work.This world\u2019s social media platform did not distinguish between\u00a0Tencent\u2019s Weibo\u00a0or\u00a0Sina\u2019s Weibo. There was only one, called Weibo. It was pretty much the same; however, there were some tiny differences in the details. For example, there was no way to display one\u2019s location. The reason was probably to protect one\u2019s privacy.\u201cHello, Teacher Zhang.\u201d\u201cTeacher Zhang, I really like your program.\u201d\u201c\u2019Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019 is too good. Your poems are also too classic!\u201d\u201cIf you need any sort of work done, please contact mobile number 1348763733!\u201d\u201cHaha, Teacher Zhang is also on Weibo? I\u2019m Xiaofang. Please add me as a fan.\u201dThere were private messages, @ messages and comments, totaling about 30 of them. There were advertisements, colleagues from the radio station and listeners.Upon seeing his fan count, he only had about 200 people. After all, he had just registered, so he could not have many fans. It needed a long period of operation. Zhang Ye picked a few comments to reply to. He also followed a few colleagues. As he browsed through this world\u2019s Weibo, there were not many major differences, so he did not find it unfamiliar. This was a very important promotional platform, so Zhang Ye treated it seriously. After giving it some thought, he decided to post his poems, \u201cFlying Bird and Fish\u201d, \u201cA Generation\u201d, the title-less \u201cIf you are living well, then the skies are clear\u201d and the \u201cThe Song of the Stormy Petrel\u201d that he had never publicly released.His fan count immediately rose!There were countless numbers of people rebroadcasting it!\u201cLet the tempest come strike harder? Wow!\u201d\u201c\u2019The Song of the Stormy Petrel\u2019 is so well written! I like it!\u201d\u201cI already thought \u201cFlying Bird and Fish\u201d and \u201cA Generation\u201d were classic enough, but after seeing \u201cThe Song of the Stormy Petrel\u201d, I feel full and delighted. This passer-by shall become a fan!\u201d\u201cIf you are living well, then the skies are clear? This is written so beautifully!\u201d\u201cTeacher Zhang has released another new poem? Awesome! I\u2019ll prostrate in front of you in full admiration!\u201dHe even saw some bigwigs leaving comments. For example, there was the famous producer Hu Fei from Central TV. He had rebroadcasted for Zhang Ye, \u201cI first liked Zhang Ye\u2019s novel, as \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019 was too original. It is totally different from the usual supernatural novels. Later on, I saw Teacher Little Zhang\u2019s two poems. I greatly fell in love with \u201cA Generation\u201d. It felt like it was written for our generation. Today, after seeing \u201cThe Song of the Stormy Petrel\u201d, this should be a prose. Having lived for so long, I have seen at least a few hundred, if not a few thousand prose. But this is the first time that I have realized that prose can be written in such a graceful and powerful manner! \u00a0I also know the Vice Editor, Old Ya, from the Beijing Times. I agree strongly with what Old Ya said that in a few hundred years, people might no longer have computers or cell phones and may even forget the dazzling celebrities of the past, to the point of forgetting things our generation think is unforgettable. But the two poems, \u201cA Generation\u201d and \u201cThe Song of the Stormy Petrel\u201d will never be forgotten. I believe they will be passed down over as a heritage, one generation after another!\u201dNaturally, Zhang Ye had to reply as he modestly answered, \u201cThank you for Teacher Hu\u2019s affirmation. I\u2019m not that noble or great as you described. I just randomly created those.\u201dHu Fei gave an astounding approval, \u201cTalent is probably innate. Some people might work their entire lives to no avail. Some people have it the moment they were born. Teacher Little Zhang is just 23 years old? My son is 22 this year, almost the same age as you. However, Teacher Zhang is already so cultured, while my son is playing on the phone all day. Sigh.\u201dPeople began to comment.\u201cMy daughter is the same. She\u2019s playing with her cell phone all day.\u201d\u201cRight, young people nowadays cannot be separated from their cellphones. Even while they are eating and talking, they would still hold onto their phones.\u201dUpon seeing this, Zhang Ye left a comment. He used a popular online phrase in his previous world. \u201cThe furthest distance in the world is not the distance between the flying bird and fish. It is that you are playing with your phone, even when I stand in front of you.\u201d\u201cPu!\u201d\u201cHaha! I\u2019m dying of stitches!\u201d\u201cTeacher Zhang is too cheeky!\u201d\u201cI never expected Teacher Zhang to be so humorous! He\u2019s a ghost story host and also a poet, so I thought he would be a particularly serious person!\u201d\u201cThat was a godly reversal!\u201dCentral TV\u2019s producer Hu Fei was also overjoyed as he posted a smiley emoticon, \u201cIn a while, I\u2019ll show this to my son!\u201dWith Zhang Ye\u2019s lead, many netizens began to spontaneously post modified versions of Zhang Ye\u2019s \u201cFlying Bird and Fish\u201d. For example, there were statements like, \u201cThe furthest distance in the world is not bringing toilet paper to the toilet.\u201d In the end, \u201cA Generation\u201d was also not spared. There were all kinds of versions, such as, \u201cThe dark night gave me black eyes, but I use them to watch movies.\u201d If other poets saw their poems being defiled beyond recognition by others, they would be furious. However, Zhang Ye did not. Not only was he not angry, he even modified his works along with the netizens. His level of self-mockery was high, which won the favor of many netizens.\u201cTeacher Zhang is really approachable!\u201d\u201cThis is what a cultured person should have!\u201d\u201c+1! Supporting Teacher Zhang\u2019s creation of more masterpieces!\u201d\u2026At the same time.Today, Tian Bin was also not working. After his program was robbed from him, he would basically be resting for three days a week. He had nothing to do at work. In an upset mood, Tian Bin would drink alone at home. As he drank, he surfed Weibo. He, too, saw Zhang Ye\u2019s interaction with the netizens and saw his fan count increasingly rapidly due to him being so well-liked. In just a day, he had several thousand fans. It was nearly about to exceed Tian Bin\u2019s 20,000 fan count. Seeing this, how could Tian Bin feel happy? He nearly flew into a rage!Producing works without a script?Every word he says is classic?Tian Bin never believed Zhang Ye had this ability. He also bore a grudge, so without switching his Weibo account, he used his official, verified Weibo account to post a message, \u201cSome people may be able to jump for a moment, but they cannot jump for life. Do not be a villainous person intoxicated by success. Do not use underhand techniques, or you will end up suffering!\u201d He did not indicate who he was speaking about, but anyone who had eyes knew that he was scolding Zhang Ye. This was because after Zhang Ye was officially verified, the VIP introduction for Tian Bin\u2019s Weibo had changed into \u201cPrevious \u2018Late-night Ghost Stories\u2019 Broadcast Host\u201d.Tian Bin had his fans, too. Some people liked Zhang Ye\u2019s style of broadcasting, but there were also people who liked Tian Bin\u2019s program. Upon seeing Teacher Tian post that comment, many of his fans immediately understood who Tian Bin was referring to. Immediately, they answered the summoning call and went on Zhang Ye\u2019s Weibo to begin cursing!\u201cUsing underhand techniques?\u201d\u201cSo this was how Zhang Ye got his position!\u201d\u201cTeacher Tian is right. I do not like Zhang Ye\u2019s program. It\u2019s practically rubbish!\u201dOn the other side, Zhang Ye was still unsure of the situation. He had just went to grab a cup of water, but when he returned, he saw lots of criticism on his Weibo!\u201cZhang Ye, you dumb pig!\u201d\u201cCalling for a boycott of Zhang Ye!\u201d\u201cWhat a rubbish program! Quickly stop broadcasting it!\u201d\u201cRight! Let Teacher Tian Bin resume his hosting of \u2018Late-night Ghost Stories\u2019!\u201dAfter Zhang Ye traced it to Tian Bin\u2019s official Weibo account and seeing the comment left by him, he immediately sneered with anger. You are looking for trouble, aren\u2019t you? You dare to say I\u2019m a villainous person?Before Zhang Ye responded, his fans and some bystanders had rushed to Tian Bin\u2019s Weibo to return their tirade!\u201cHow can there be such a cheap person under the Heavens?\u201d\u201cPublicly scolding his colleague on Weibo? Who is the villain here?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it because of Teacher Zhang\u2019s literacy skills being better than yours that caused the result of him replacing you? If you aren\u2019t happy about it, win the program back yourself. Can you only curse at someone behind their back?\u201d\u201cWhat a joke. And there\u2019s so many people chiming in? Are you all a bunch of people who like to curse?\u201dAt this moment, the producer Hu Fei, who had exchanged some words with Zhang Ye on Weibo, helped speak out for Zhang Ye, \u201cPeople should have some bearing in their conduct. One shouldn\u2019t pull someone down just because someone is better than you. What a joke. Anyone with any smarts knows what is going with a glance!\u201dThe two sides began to set off a war of words!Weibo immediately bustled with activity!\u201cSon, come eat some fruit!\u201d Mom shouted from outside his room, after waking up from her afternoon nap.Zhang Ye had no mood to eat, \u201cI\u2019m not eating. I\u2019m busy.\u201dMom pushed the door open and entered, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Eat first, before you busy yourself.\u201dZhang Ye stared at the computer, \u201cI can\u2019t eat. A colleague is using his verified account to scold me on Weibo. His actions are too horrible. I need to deal with it.\u201dMom was also enraged, \u201cWho dares to scold my son? This little son of a bitch! But don\u2019t you scold back at him. He may not be right, but we need to make sure of the repercussive effects. After all, your status is no longer the same.\u201d\u201cI got it. Go back.\u201d Zhang Ye saw Tian Bin post another comment.Tian Bin, \u201cA person with questionable character is useless, no matter how talented he is!\u201dZhang Ye sneered and replied, \u201cHow is my character questionable? Can you please talk about it Teacher Tian!?\u201dTian Bin took on an enigmatic tone in his words, \u201cYou really do not know?\u201d Alright then. Hehe.Zhang Ye, \u201cDo not use these mysterious words to mislead everyone. Tell me what I did wrong; I want to know, too!\u201dTian Bin scoffed, \u201cYou know very well what sort of character you have!\u201dZhang Ye angrily said, \u201cI really do not know. You can say it straight out. I have always done things with a clear conscience. By using this vague tone, aren\u2019t you showing the lack of confidence in your words?\u201dTian Bin, \u201cHehe. A villainous person is a villainous person.\u201d\u2026Beijing Radio Station.There were many people working in the Literature Channel\u2019s office today.A midday program\u2019s DJ suddenly shouted, \u201cHey, quickly look at Weibo. Something has happened! Tian Bin and Zhang Ye are fighting!\u201d\u201cAh? What happened?\u201d\u201cThey are fighting? Let me see!\u201d\u201cAiyah! Teacher Tian is\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat is Tian Bin doing? How can he say such things!\u201d\u201cAnd he is even using his verified Weibo account. This will give off a bad vibe. The listeners will even wonder what\u2019s going on if they see this!\u201dA few old comrades in the station were very displeased. Wang Xiaomei frowned, while Xiaofang was enraged!\u201cI\u2019ll let the Leader know!\u201d\u201cWho is going to call Tian Bin and Zhang Ye? Tell them not to fight! Quickly delete their Weibo comments!\u201d\u2026Ring, ring, ring. A phone call came in.Zhang Ye saw the number and it was Teacher Feng from the \u201cOld and Young Story Club\u201d segment. Upon picking it up, he heard Teacher Feng say, \u201cLittle Zhang, quickly delete those messages on Weibo. Director Zhao has got wind of the matter. He\u2019s already going crazy and wants you to stop immediately. Anymore of this will be detrimental to the station. Someone has already approached Tian Bin, too. Quickly cool down. We can talk about this in the office tomorrow!\u201dZhang Ye said angrily, \u201cI\u2019ve been scolded by Tian Bin and his fans all day. I have not said a single swear word or slanderous comment, right? You want me to cool down? Did I say too much? I was just getting Tian Bin to explain how my character was lacking. Why am I a villainous person? Do I have any other problem?\u201dTeacher Feng said, \u201cLook at your temper. Are you being nasty with me? Kid, cool down. I\u2019m not saying you are wrong, I\u2019m just asking you to endure it.\u201d\u201cTeacher Feng, it isn\u2019t my intention. Alright, I got it.\u201d Zhang Ye said without any qualms. Amongst all the broadcasting hosts in the Literature Channel, his impression of Teacher Feng was the best. He was a veteran, but he had no airs. He was kindly to everyone, so Zhang Ye naturally would not get angry with Teacher Feng.\u201cThat\u2019s good. Calming down is the best.\u201d With that, Teacher Feng hung up the phone.However, just after he threw down his phone, Zhang Ye sneered at the computer. Although he had promised Teacher Feng to cool down, he did not have any plans to doing so. Delete my Weibo comments? Remain silent? That Tian has already said so much; how could I remain silent!?Tian Bin\u2019s fans were still attacking him.\u201cLook, Zhang Ye is no longer speaking?\u201d\u201cHehehe. This is because he\u2019s trembling from the scolding!\u201d\u201cAn idiot is an idiot! How dare a rookie rob an elder\u2019s position!\u201d\u201cI really feel helpless for Teacher Tian! Why did he have to encounter a person who did not know where he stands!\u201d\u201cEveryone, carry on scolding! Keep refreshing! Do not have any scruples! Let\u2019s get justice for Teacher Tian!\u201dTian Bin also fanned the flames from time to time to incite the people\u2019s emotions. He could not swear, but he could stir up his fans to curse!Some of those who cursed at Zhang Ye did not know the truth. They thought that Teacher Tian had some grievance due to Zhang Ye. A large number of them were just following the crowd. The internet was a more open platform. Some people just liked to curse, so they would ignore everything else and curse first, without knowing the truth. After all, Zhang Ye would definitely not curse back at them, as he was a public figure. He had to take note of the effects of his words. This made those people, who were joining in the fun to curse, become more unbridled in their attacks. They felt good about being able to curse at someone who had better achievements than themselves!Don\u2019t dare to curse back?Indeed, if it was any average radio host, they would definitely not do so. However, Zhang Ye was not any average person. They did not understand Zhang Ye\u2019s temperament at all!Cursing at him for no reason?Stepping over his head time and again?He knew deeply what the internet was like. There was no reason behind today\u2019s matter. They were just cursing for the sake of cursing. The matter was not settled by who was being more reasonable, as it was meaningless in trying to be reasonable. Everything was determined by strength! Everything was determined by who was more fierce in their combat prowess! Alright! I\u2019ll do a good job cursing with you today! Isn\u2019t it just swearing? You really think I don\u2019t know how!? That I\u2019m afraid of all of you?*Weibo\u00a0is a social platform in China, known as micro-blogging. Weibo uses a format similar to its American counterpart Twitter.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 32": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I\u2019m Really a SuperstarCH 31Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 31: Every Cursing Sentence is Classic!The war of words carried on.Tian Bin was experienced at Weibo, having used it for many years. He had many more fans, who were much more loyal. With his lead, he immediately caused the people supporting Zhang Ye to retreat!\u201cYou can\u2019t defeat us in your curses, right?\u201d\u201cIf you can\u2019t, then cut the crap!\u201d\u201cStill speaking up for Zhang Ye? All of you should just get lost, along with him!\u201dThere were criticisms everywhere. Zhang Ye\u2019s fans had no way of defending themselves!Since someone from the radio station had called Zhang Ye, then there was definitely another person who had contacted Tian Bin. However, not only did Tian Bin not delete his Weibo messages, he even fanned the flames to cause more friction. Finally, Zhang Ye\u2019s wrath was unleashed!Are you cursing?Alright, here we go! I\u2019ll count every one of them!Today I\u2019ll show you my warring skills!Zhang Ye\u2019s vocabulary in cursing was actually lacking, but he was not afraid, because he was not fighting alone! He immediately used all the Internet catchphrases from his previous world and scolded in return, \u201cIndeed, I\u2019m a villainous person intoxicated by success, but some people are not even human. What are they even talking about? I want to know, whose whose Weibo is this? Are you verified as a VIP? You are not a VIP. You not even a V. From all I see, you are a P (fart). Your complex facial features cannot hide your simple IQ. When I see you, I feel to have a naturally superior IQ. Friends, do not scold them. Never battle with beasts. If you win? You are more beastly than beasts. If you lose? You are not even a beast (inhuman). If it\u2019s a tie? You are no different from a beast! Also, we can never beat idiots, nor should we try to reason with idiots. This is because they would drag your intelligence down to their level, then they would beat you with their immense experience!\u201dThis world had its catchphrases, too. For example, \u201cYour door is filled with parasol trees.\u201d This was due to something that happened half a year ago. Parasol trees were planted at mental institutions in the entire country and this was a widely spread practice. In the end, parasol trees were used as a euphemism to insinuate that someone was crazy. Similarly, Zhang Ye had the catchphrases from his world. These catchphrases had never been heard of in this world. Furthermore, this was the essence gathered from the collective wisdom of the masses. With so much knowledge gathered in Zhang Ye, how could he lose?With this reply, the replies underneath the post exploded immediately!\u201cHoly shit!\u201d\u201cTeacher Zhang is striking back!\u201d\u201cAhahahaha! Quick, take a look!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s too delightful! You are too awesome!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m totally convinced of Teacher Zhang Ye\u2019s talent today!\u201d\u201cHis novel is classic, his poems are classic. Hehe, even his curses are classic. Wow, I think I\u2019m in love with Teacher Zhang Ye. He\u2019s too aggressive!\u201d\u201cNever battle with beasts? Haha!\u201d\u201cBeat you with their immense experience? What a godly statement! It is definitely a godly statement!\u201dTian Bin replied. One could feel the embarrassment and anger in his words. \u201cYou are cursing? Do you have any culture in you? Do you know your status?\u201d\u201cSupporting Teacher Tian!\u201d\u201cA broadcasting host with such manners should be fired!\u201d\u201cWhat sort of person is he! How can the radio station hire a radio host of this quality?\u201dThe moment Zhang Ye engaged in battle, Tian Bin\u2019s fans also helped Tian Bin battle with Zhang Ye!Zhang Ye answered calmly, \u201cI am not cursing. I am just narrating the truth and facts. I\u2019m teaching everyone how to communicate with people like you. I have come into contact with Teacher Tian. The first word that came to my mind when I saw Teacher Tian was the word, \u2018well\u2019 (\u4e95)!\u201dSomeone asked, \u201cWell? Water well?\u201d\u201cA frog in the well?\u201d someone guessed.Only Zhang Ye was able to clear their doubts, \u201c\u4e95 is the word \u4e8c (doing things dumbly and unbecoming of their status) both horizontally and vertically!\u201dImmediately all sorts of emoticons of spitting out their water while laughing appeared below the message, \u201cHahaha!\u201dZhang Ye did not stop, \u201cTeacher Tian, I always had a question. Why did you give up treatment? Why? There are so many weapons in China, but why did you have to learn swords (ji\u00e0n). Why did you not learn the way of the upper sword, but have to learn the way of the lower sword (xi\u00e0ji\u00e0n/morally degrading). Why did you not learn iron swords, but have to learn silver swords (y\u00edn ji\u00e0n/morally lewd). Congratulations for becoming one with the sword today, commonly known as a sword person (ji\u00e0n r\u00e9n/slut)!\u201dTian Bin, \u201c\u2026$#%$##@!!\u201d\u201cYour grandmother!\u201d\u201cZhang Ye, you are too harsh!\u201d\u201cYou are a parasol tree!\u201d\u201cDumb pig! Idiot!\u201dTian Bin\u2019s fans immediately cried out with anger!As for Zhang Ye\u2019s fans, they were dumbfounded. They momentarily forgot to reply to help push the tide. They were only watching.However, Zhang Ye did not stop. He replied with sentence after sentence, \u201cYou are the dumb pig! Your whole house is filled with dumb pigs! Teacher Tian, actually you shouldn\u2019t feel inferior. Even if you made a mistake to cause the Leader to cancel your program, you are still a successful person. As a model case for being a failure, you are too successful!\u201dEveryone, \u201c\u2026\u201dZhang Ye carried on cursing, \u201cThere is a saying that is especially good. God said let there be light, and so there was light. God said let there be water, so there was water. God said let there be idiots, hence you were born.\u201d With a pause, \u201cActually to summarize, I shall give you a sentence, I bought a watch last year (w\u01d2 q\u00f9ni\u00e1n m\u01cei g\u00e8 bi\u01ceo)!\u201dSome netizens said, \u201cAh? Buying a watch? What does this mean?\u201dAnother fan of Tian Bin retorted, \u201cYou can\u2019t even say your words properly; how are you even a host? Is that a sentence? The term to describe the quantity for watch is ku\u00e0i; to think you bought a (g\u00e8) watch?\u201d\u201dZhang Ye said, \u201cTry typing out the first letter of each word!\u201d\u201cI bought a watch last year?\u00a0WQNMLGB? F**k your mother\u2019s c**t (w\u01d2 q\u00f9 n\u01d0 m\u0101le g\u00e9b\u00ec)? Hahahaha!\u201d Netizens immediately burst out with laughter till their backs bent over!Zhang Ye cursed Tian Bin for more than an hour. Not a single one of his curses were repeated and each was worse than the last!Tian Bin angrily said, \u201cYou are so ugly! Why don\u2019t you look at yourself in the mirror!\u201dZhang Ye typed with a smile, \u201cIndeed, I\u2019m not good looking. But at least I\u2019m pleasing to the eye. As for you? Your photo can be hung on the wall to ward off evil! Hung above the bed, it wards off pregnancy!\u201dSeeing this sentence, Tian Bin nearly vomited blood as he went into a rage! Zhang! I\u2019m irreconcilable with you!\u201cHung on the wall to ward off evil? Hung above the bed, it wards off pregnancy?\u201d\u201cPuchi! Ahahahaha! So damaging! So damaging that it reaches your grandma\u2019s house!\u201d\u201cDelightful! I never knew cursing can be done in this way! Teacher Zhang is invincible!\u201dThis sentence was actually a classic amongst swear phrases. Once it was revealed, more than a hundred responses and comments surged in the next ten seconds. The onlookers could no longer sit still!With Zhang Ye leading the way, his fans who were pushed into a corner immediately turned the tides as their momentum rose to unprecedented heights! They began to swing the flags of battle for Zhang Ye!Tian Bin was still returning fire with curses, but he was no match for Zhang Ye. In the beginning, there were many Tian Bin fans who were helping their idol curse at Zhang Ye. However, Zhang Ye\u2019s combat power was too monstrous. He did not need the help from his fans. His tongue was like a warring hero, as he managed to silence hundreds of people alone. In the end, almost none of Tian Bin\u2019s fans said a word. Those who had joined in the fun to curse were attacked by Zhang Ye, until their intestines turned green. After a few retaliative words, they knew they were no match for Zhang Ye. They slowly disappeared, so as to not embarrass themselves. There was only Tian Bin who was retaliating with anger!He battled one against a hundred!After cursing away one, another came!The final outcome was\u2026Zhang Ye\u2019s complete victory!All the onlookers on Weibo were stunned!What the f**k is this battle power? Could swearing be so earth-shattering? This was the first time they had seen it! Only when Tian Bin was sworn at until he was reduced to a whimper did the crowd come around. Quickly, they began becoming fans of Zhang Ye\u2019s Weibo account in an excited fervor. His fan count surged to 31,000. With that, Zhang Ye\u2019s game ring\u2019s Reputation points rose from several thousand to 54,000!Zhang Ye was speechless!Cursing could also bring Reputation points? Heh, this makes me feel good!Zhang Ye was pondering if he should make a living through cursing. This Reputation seemed to be gained for free. Could he become the world\u2019s greatest celebrity just from cursing?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

From now on, Teacher Zhang Ye will be the Leader of our internet troll army!\u201dMightOfALittleWarrior: \u201cSeeing Teacher Zhang Ye\u2019s curses, I realize how naive I had been. I even boasted that I was a cursing specialist with no competition. But after seeing today\u2019s events, I\u2019ve been humbled. I wonder if Teacher Zhang Ye takes disciples. I would like to learn your art of cursing. If I could get 10% of your skills, no, just 1%, I would not be afraid anymore while I travel the world!\u201d\u201cIn the process of breaking down\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cGod, what did I just witness!?\u201d\u201cThis Weibo account has almost gone up to the first page!\u201d\u201cWhat happened here? Why is the click rate for the comments so high?\u201d\u201cTeacher Zhang Ye\u2019s image has just collapsed for me. Is this the same Teacher Zhang Ye who wrote \u2018Flying Bird and Fish\u2019? This is that Teacher Zhang Ye who wrote \u2018A Generation\u2019? This is too much\u2026\u2026 I like it too much! Haha! Well cursed! Such kinds of people deserve such curses!\u201d\u201cTalent! This is what talent is!\u201d\u201cThis cursing can even move the heavens! He is no doubt a great poet!\u201d\u201cCome on, how can a poet curse like this?\u201d\u201cTo the previous poster: which writer or poet does not curse? Consider the most famous Teacher Chen Tianmo; was his first poem not one that was used to curse too? It even had vulgarities!\u201dEveryone started to heatedly discuss. The center of focus were Zhang Ye\u2019s Weibo\u2019s curses!\u2026At the unit.The radio station\u2019s colleagues had all witnessed Zhang Ye\u2019s curses that had a touch of genius; some of them even could not hold in their laughter!\u201cTeacher Little Zhang has such an ability?\u201d\u201cIt really is unbelievable; these curses are too humorous!\u201d\u201cHahahaha. I\u2019ve already compiled all those curses!\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t this a little bad? The Leader was so anxious just now. Why\u2026..\u201d\u201cThose curses are already unretractable. It\u2019s too late; we will leave it to the leader to deal with tomorrow.\u201d\u201cThis time, it\u2019s really Tian Bin\u2019s bad luck. He actually met Zhang Ye, a person who would rather die than lose out. Tian Bin sure got cursed into a terrible state!\u201d\u201cLittle Zhang sure is godly. Say, about all those classic amongst classic curse sentences, how do you think that he came up with them? Were they on-the-spot creations again?\u201d\u201cRight, that \u2018I bought a watch last year\u2019 sure was marvelous!\u201d\u201cHehe. I prefer that line about \u2018why did you give up treatment\u2019! It was so funny!\u201d\u201cAfter being cursed to such a pathetic state, I\u2019m guessing that Tian Bin would have no face to come to work tomorrow!\u201dTeacher Feng was at a loss of whether to laugh or cry, \u201cThis Little Zhang.. I already told him to delete his Weibo messages and not speak anymore. But no matter what, he refused to listen. Now we are in this state.\u201dAnother person who had a good relationship with Tian Bin said, \u201cHow can Little Zhang do this? This will cause a lot of negative exposure. They might think everyone in our radio station is of such a culture!\u201dXiaofang did not like what was said, \u201cIt was Teacher Tian who instigated the matter first; Teacher Zhang was just in self-defense!\u201d\u2026The matter seemed to have calm down, but in fact, it was far from having done so.Zhang Ye\u2019s \u201cfamous sentences\u201d had never appeared in this world yet. However, in his world, every sentence was extremely popular on the internet. Actually, when Zhang Ye was using all of them to curse, he did not feel particularly happy about it. Why? This was because, from his knowledge, all those curses had already been overused and outdated. For example, \u201cI bought a watch last year\u201d\u2026 The people in Zhang Ye\u2019s old world had used it too much. It had lost its charm. As for that sentence about \u201cnever battle with beasts\u201d, if Zhang Ye were to post it on his world\u2019s discussion boards, people would definitely reply with things like, \u201cCongratulations to OP for getting onto the internet.\u201d It was so overused that no one used it anymore. However, in this world, no one had yet to hear all these catchphrases. Hence, when Zhang Ye revealed a large number of them, they immediately caused an intense sensation on the internet!There were even well-meaning people who compiled a list of classic Zhang Ye phrases as they copied every sentence he used to let everyone worship!During this time, there were also many people in the same industry who replied.\u201cKeep calm. All of you, calm down!\u201d\u201cWatching.\u201d\u201cWaiting for new sentences.\u201d\u201cHas it already ended?\u201dA few radio station counterparts from other provinces and municipalities expressed concern.This sort of matter would not have been much in another industry and would not have made even a splash in their entertainment circles; however, in their radio station media circle, it was still quite novel. As such, it began spreading like wildfire as counterparts from other radio stations also spread this in an instant. Many people logged in to Weibo to watch the show upon hearing this interesting piece of news. After seeing Zhang Ye\u2019s phrases, most of the counterparts only had one reaction. In the future, you could offend anyone else, but never a person like this. Your sister, your curses are so wicked. If someone had a bad heart, he would have died of a heart attack from the rage!The development carried on.People carried on replying and following the matter without any tinge of tiredness.Zhang Ye was like a fighter. He did not even eat dinner. He was waiting in front of the computer for Tian Bin to appear once again. He was prepared to engage in another round of battle at any time. He was not afraid of anyone. In the end, the other party did not even whimper, making Zhang Ye have a slight yearning for more.With that, Zhang Ye posted a final message for this matter and clarified, \u201cStatement: my personal words are representative of my personal views. It has nothing to do with my respective radio station. I am not a person who liked to use vulgarities. However, if someone were to bully me, I would not sit idle. As for those people who tried to fan the flames and for those who scolded me without any provocation, I can only give you four words. Please (QU) take (NI) good (MA) care (DE)!\u201d The last sentence he used was also a popular theme in his world. The four words were still those four words, but the pinyin notes were something else. Of course, in this world, no one had seen such a thing!People could not react in time as they had never come into contact with something like that!\u201cPlease take good care?\u201d\u201cEh, why did Teacher Zhang Ye suddenly become so refined?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s not refined! Haha! Quick, look at the pinyin for \u201cplease take good care\u201d! Do not look at the words!\u201d\u201cThe pinyin behind? QU? NI? MA? DE? Go? f**k? your? self? Pu!\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a hidden catch! I\u2019m dying of laughter! I can\u2019t even close my jaw! I really am laughing madly today!\u201d\u201cTeacher Zhang Ye is too damaging! Whoever offends him won\u2019t have a good outcome! Asking for help from God! From today onward, Teacher Zhang Ye will be my spiritual leader!\u201d\u201cThe word of God!\u201d\u201cHa! I\u2019ve already fan-ed!\u201d\u201cHowever strong you are, there is always someone stronger!\u201d\u201cThis is the first time I have realized that there can be so much knowledge in cursing!\u201d\u201cAs above. This is the first time I have realized that cursing can be so artistic!\u201dAfter the Weibo battle ended, Tian Bin\u2019s side completely died down as Zhang Ye shouted his stance! No one dare to fight again!Before this, there usually would not be any end to a war of words online. It would just be one scolding the other, with the other responding with a curse. This would then keep going back and forth, with no way to decide who was the victor, as no one would take it lying down, as no one wanted to eat humble pie. However, today was an exception. Zhang Ye had managed to curse a few hundred people so well that they could not respond alone! Many onlookers who were watching felt their blood boil! If one man guards the pass, ten thousand are unable to get through!What sort of style was this!?How domineering was this!?The last curse had increased Zhang Ye\u2019s Weibo fans by another 6,000. This was just the popularity gained purely from cursing. Looking at the entire internet, Zhang Ye was the first person to rapidly gain so many fans just from his curse words and not because of his target audience!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Without eating breakfast, he switched on the computer at home. The computer in his parents\u2019 home was a locally-made \u201cDonghua\u201d brand. It was also a brand that Zhang Ye had never heard of. It was cheap and its price-to-performance ratio was relatively higher. The only problem was it liked to hang.Checking online, Tian Bin\u2019s Weibo messages had already been deleted. Zhang Ye also began deleting some of his Weibo messages that he had posted the previous night. There was no other way, as Director Zhao had called him personally last night to rage. Everything seemed to be calm, but anyone who had experienced yesterday\u2019s war of words knew how thrilling the scene was.Oh?This year\u2019s online catchphrases?Through a Weibo link, Zhang Ye entered a voting website. It was the selection of the top ten most popular online catchphrases that appeared over the past year. This was quite different from his previous world. The catchphrases that were popular were nearly all acknowledged by the public and that was it. In this world, there was a tiny difference. Many of the popular catchphrases caught on only through the voting of netizens. The result was quite interesting. If one didn\u2019t see it, they would not know. But just looking at it would give a shock!No. 1. I bought a watch last year \u2013 Zhang Ye.No. 2. Please (QU) take (NI) good (MA) care (DE) \u2013 Zhang Ye.No. 3. Your door is filled with parasol trees \u2013 from netizen, I\u2019m your aunt.No. 4. Teacher Tian, why did you give up treatment? \u2013 Zhang Ye.Amongst the top ten internet catchphrases, Zhang Ye\u2019s curses had been given tens of thousands of votes by netizens to take the top few spots. The first, second and fourth spots were all his. Looking further down, the rest of Zhang Ye\u2019s other curses were hovering between the 20th-30th spots. The votes were for them were also continuously increasing. Zhang Ye was immediately delighted. Especially because that \u201cwhy did you give up treatment\u201d phrase had Tian Bin\u2019s name in front of it!After the war of words ended, the newspapers did not report it. This was because Zhang Ye and Tian Bin were not very famous, so this was not considered news. However, there were some online media and other people who had participated in the war of the words that gave their evaluation.\u201cThe culture and quality of radio station hosts\u201d.\u201cA blockbuster war of words. A poet\u2019s counterattack\u201d.\u201cWeibo miracle. A war of words that gained the notice of tens of thousands of people\u201d.After a few simple sweeps of the news, Zhang Ye finished the breakfast his parents had made for him, before going to work.\u2026The unit.Upon reaching the doorstep of the radio station building, many staff members, who Zhang Ye did not know, were looking at him. Some were even pointing at him.\u201cThat\u2019s Zhang Ye!\u201d\u201cHe is the one? Haha.\u201d\u201cDid you see Weibo yesterday? Too awesome!\u201dThere was even a youth from the human resources department who waved at Zhang Ye, \u201cTeacher Zhang, you came? Good morning.\u201dZhang Ye blinked, clearly not knowing him, but he still politely greeted back, \u201cHow are you? Good morning.\u201d Great, I must have become famous again. However, Zhang Ye, who wanted to be famous even in his dreams, was not very happy today. He bitterly smiled because he knew that this was infamy. As he approached his office, he felt more perturbed. *Cough*, he didn\u2019t know how the Leader would dispose of him.Upon entering the office, everyone was already there.\u201cAh, Teacher Zhang!\u201d Xiaofang was the first to see him.Teacher Feng, who was about to retire soon, said with some resentment, \u201cYoung man, you\u2026 Why are you so impulsive?\u201dOther people either laughed or glanced over. Their looks became complicated when they looked at Zhang Ye.Zhang Ye said, \u201cTeacher Feng, it\u2019s not that I\u2019m impulsive. It\u2019s just that someone was pushing it too far. He scolded me on Weibo for no rhyme or reason. He even led his fans to curse at me. How could I not fight back?\u201d Don\u2019t look at him writing poems and novels; in fact, those did not show his true side. He was extremely\u00a0nationalistic\u00a0and cursed at any grievance under the sky. This was this fellow\u2019s true nature. He was just a very ordinary villainous person. He was not as noble as how people thought him to be.\u201cRight, where\u2019s Tian Bin?\u201d Zhang Ye began looking.Teacher Feng hesitated with an odd look before saying, \u201cHe\u2019s been hospitalized. He\u2019s on leave today.\u201d\u201cHospitalized?\u201d Zhang Ye felt nervous. Don\u2019t tell me this bro had agitated him into such a state? That can\u2019t be, right?Someone from the editing department said, \u201cLittle Zhang, you are definitely in trouble this time. Director Zhao said for you to look for him the moment that you reached the unit.\u201dZhang Ye said innocently, \u201cI didn\u2019t cause any trouble. All of you should have seen. It was Teacher Tian who threw the first stone. You can\u2019t blame me for his hospitalization, right? Hai, the saying is so apt,\u00a0NO-ZUO, NO-DIE.\u201dXiaofang was stunned, \u201cWhat does it mean?\u201dThe other people were also curious, \u201cIs it English? No? Die? What was that?\u201dZhang Ye explained, \u201cIf you read it together\u2026 If you don\u2019t seek death, you won\u2019t die.\u201dTeacher Feng spat out the water he had just drunk from his white porcelain mug upon hearing this. He began coughing, \u201cThat mouth of yours sure is wicked!\u201dEveryone, \u201cHow do you speak English at home!?\u201dNO-ZUO? NO-DIE? Upon hearing this, Wang Xiaomei, who was usually reticent, was also amused. After clearing her throat and wiping her smile, she went back to work.Turning around, Zhang Ye bitterly laughed to hide his anxiousness as he walked towards the Leader\u2019s office. He knocked on the door twice.\u201cWho is it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s me, Zhang Ye!\u201d\u201c\u2026Come in!\u201dUpon hearing Zhang Ye\u2019s name, the tone from inside immediately turned unfriendly.Zhang Ye carefully entered the room and saw Zhao Guozhou watering the flowers by the window sill. He closed the door and said, \u201cLeader, I heard Editor Zhou say you were looking for me?\u201dZhao Guozhou said hoarsely, \u201cDo you know why I\u2019m looking for you?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know?\u201d Zhang Ye feigned ignorance, \u201cIs it about the recording of \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019? Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll finish recording them today. The recorded program can be broadcast for more than a month without a problem.\u201dZhao Guozhou turned speechless, \u201cAre you playing dumb with me?\u201dZhang Ye could only admit his faults, \u201cLeader, I know I wasn\u2019t entirely in the right yesterday, but it was Tian Bin who first scolded me as a villainous person intoxicated by success. He even fanned the flames to get his fans to curse at me. Tell me, what should I have done? I could not have pretended to not see it, right?\u201dZhao Guozhou said angrily, \u201cHe has his faults! You, too, have your own faults! No matter what, Tian Bin did not use a single vulgarity, right? What about you? Look at what you posted! Yesterday, the station\u2019s Leader even called my home! He asked me what was going on! Do you know how great an effect that has brought to the station? Eh?\u201d Zhao Guozhou placed the watering pot down and said, \u201cYou do not need to explain any further. I\u2019ll write you down with a demerit mark. Well, then\u2026 Write a self-reflective essay. I\u2019ll decide after seeing the self-reflective essay. If your attitude is still incorrect, I\u2019ll add on more punishments. It\u2019s your choice!\u201dZhang Ye was not willing to do it, \u201cDirector Zhao, I\u2019ll accept the demerit mark. However, I will not write the self-reflective essay, because I do not think I did anything wrong!\u201dZhao Guozhou angrily said, \u201cYou still want to legitimize your cursing?\u201d\u201cBut Weibo is my personal space. I had also stated that whatever I said was my personal opinion and, as such, has nothing to do with the unit!\u201d Zhang Ye quibbled. How old was he, for him to still write a self-reflective essay!? He was not an elementary student anymore. Zhang Ye would definitely not agree to it, as this was about his principles and dignity!\u201cYou are still quibbling?\u201d Zhao Guozhou stared at him.\u201cYou can give me any punishments, but I will definitely not write the self-reflective essay!\u201d Zhang Ye said firmly.Zhao Guozhou nodded, \u201cAlright, then I\u2019ll leave your bonus for next month on the backburner. I\u2019ll hand out the bonus only after you turn in the self-reflective essay!\u201dDeducting his bonus?What a joke! How can a bonus compare with anything!?Zhang Ye said without thinking, \u201cI\u2019ll immediately write the self-reflective essay! I\u2019ll pass it to you in a while!\u201dZhao Guozhou, \u201c\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There were hosts on television stations who had cursed using vulgarities on Weibo, too. In the end, they were also fine. They, too, were given a warning and some disciplinary measures were meted out. After finishing writing the self-reflective essay, this matter was considered to have a simple end to it. Of course, it was not that simple. For a short period of time, Zhang Ye still had to behave himself by tucking his tail between his legs to slowly let the effects wear off. There was no other way out. Did anyone ask him to curse on Weibo so vehemently? He had even cursed to the point of Tian Bin being hospitalized. He had to pay the cost of having so much fun.One hour\u2026Three hours\u2026Zhang Ye ended the first \u201cGhost Blows Out the Light\u201d book. As for the sequel, \u201cGhost Blows Out the Light 2\u201d, Zhang Ye was not prepared to narrate it. This was because he felt it was a lot worse than the first one. Zhang Ye did not want to take the risk, as it could affect his listenership rates. So he decided to just call it a day.It had finally ended.Phew, Zhang Ye felt like a huge burden had lifted off his chest. The remaining recording tapes were enough for \u201cLate-night Ghost Stories\u201d to be broadcast for the next one to two months. He no longer need to work overtime from day to night. He could finally take a break.Lunch time.At the canteen downstairs, it was crowded.\u201cMaster, I want fried eggplant, fried meat and two bowls of rice.\u201d After Zhang Ye received his wage and bonus, he decided not to eat instant noodles anymore. Finally, he was able to order a big meal at the canteen. Actually, their canteen\u2019s food was pretty good and cheap. Furthermore, there was a meal allowance in their salary. Zhang Ye was not in need of that cash. When he handed the 11 Yuan to the chef, Zhang Ye felt like he was like a tycoon spending lavishly. This meal was so extravagant!\u201cLittle Zhang.\u201d a person called out.After Zhang Ye received his meal, he looked towards where the voice came from, \u201cYou are?\u201dThe secretary of the station\u2019s Leader called him over, \u201cStation Head Jia invites you over.\u201dZhang Ye was puzzled. As such, he followed the secretary to a small cafeteria at the back. It was also a large lobby, but there were small partitions that separated the spaces. Right, it was similar to restrooms. Typically, only station leaders or channel directors or deputy directors had the right to sit in these small dining rooms for their meals. Previously, the small cafeteria was given special treatment. Things were done more exquisitely and fine, but as the higher-ups sent a note down to promote thriftiness, the special cafeteria was removed. The Leaders shared their meals together with everyone.In a partition.Zhao Guozhou and Deputy Station Head Jia were sitting opposite one another. There was another Leader sitting beside whom Zhang Ye did not know.\u201cStation Head Jia, Director Zhao,\u201d Zhang Ye stood there holding his meal, \u201cAre you looking for me?\u201dZhao Guozhou pressed his hands down, \u201cSit down, Little Zhang. Let\u2019s eat together. Station Head Jia has something to discuss with you. Let\u2019s talk as we eat.\u201dDeputy Station Head Jia was a little old man. Back when Zhang Ye participated in the recording of \u201cTalk About the World\u201d, encountering the suicide problem, Deputy Station Head Jia had also come. He had thus met Zhang Ye once. Hearing Deputy Station Head Jia put down his chopsticks as he smiled like a chrysanthemum flower with his wrinkled face, \u201cI saw you queuing up for lunch when I was walking over. So, I got my secretary to call you over. How is it? I heard your program is almost done recording?\u201dZhang Ye said without inhibitions, \u201cIt\u2019s already done recording.\u201dZhao Guozhou praised, \u201cLittle Zhang had worked overtime for quite a number of days. He recorded dozens of episodes continuously. He\u2019s very hardworking.\u201dDeputy Station Head Jia acknowledged tersely before changing his tone, \u201cThe only thing that wasn\u2019t well-done was yesterday\u2019s matter, right? Weibo may be your private zone, but your verified status also indicates our radio station. You are a public figure, so everything you say and do must be done with propriety, in consideration of the possible effects!\u201dZhang Ye admitted his fault, \u201cLeader, it won\u2019t happen again.\u201dAfter criticizing Zhang Ye a bit, the leader sitting by the side, who Zhang Ye did not know, pulled out a document.Deputy Station Head Jia took it and gave a look before nodding. He handed the document to Zhang Ye, \u201cI was looking for you because of the publication of \u201cGhost Blows Out the Light\u201d. You are also lucky, as the station has decided to help you deal with matters of publication.\u201dZhang Ye was surprised, \u201cPublication? Our radio station has a publication division?\u201dDeputy Station Head Jia said, \u201cWe don\u2019t, but we do all the work with helping you connect with publishers. This is the power of attorney. Take a look. If you are fine with it, then sign it. A staff specially in charge of contracting the publishing and marketing for \u201cGhost Blows Out the Light\u201d will contact you when the time comes. You do not need to worry much. Also, we will give you quite a high price. 20,000 for the book!\u201dZhang Ye was shocked, \u201c20,000? Selling all the copyright?\u201dDeputy Station Head Jia did not seem pleased with Zhang Ye\u2019s reaction, \u201cOf course, we are buying the copyright. A rookie usually would not even be given any royalties. Also, as the risk is greater, how is 20,000 little? You are a rookie who has never had any experience publishing. 20,000 for the book\u2019s copyright is a very high price. If you get to know the market, you will understand.Understand my ass!You think I\u2019m a f**king retard?In fact, Zhang Ye was not intending to publish his novels in the short term. He knew his roots were in the radio station. He wanted to do his job well at the radio station, producing good results and becoming famous. There was no hurry in publishing until further in the future. But even if he was not in a hurry to publish, he was also a bit unhappy. Why isn\u2019t anyone contacting me for the publication of such a good novel? Are the publishers dumb? Only through Deputy Station Head Jia\u2019s words did Zhang Ye finally understand. It was not that the publishers did not eye his novel. They had definitely gone through the radio station first, but the station had never informed him about it. They did not seek his opinion and wanted to first create a power of attorney. The power of attorney had many words. It was about seven to eight pages long. Upon scanning it, the general meaning of it was to hand all the copyright of \u201cGhost Blows Out the Light\u201d, including, but not limited to, the simplified and traditional Chinese movie adaptation, as well as the television drama adaptation, to the radio station. Finally, Zhang Ye would receive a one-time copyright fee of 20,000 Yuan for each novel.Give it to you? Do you think I\u2019m sick!?You do not have a publishing division and are just an intermediary. You are taking my copyright to sell to another publisher to earn the intermediary fee for nothing. Why wouldn\u2019t I look for a publisher myself? And 20,000 for the book? I would not sell even if it was 200,000 for the book! Are you trying to wave off a beggar?Zhang Ye knew the station was conning him. Deputy Station Head Jia must have already made an agreement with the publisher. For example, after obtaining Zhang Ye\u2019s copyright, they would sell it to the publisher for ten times or more. They might also sign a royalty agreement with the publisher, obtaining revenue according to the sales. From the results of \u201cGhost Blows Out the Light\u201d, it was definitely not a problem to sell at least 200,000 copies of the simplified Chinese edition. How much money was that? Also, if the copyright was in the hands of the radio station, then the revenue would be all theirs. Zhang Ye would have no right to receive any royalties. The most maddening thing was that they were even grabbing the copyright to the movie and television drama versions of \u201cGhost Blows Out the Light\u201d. Isn\u2019t this a rip-off?Zhang Ye said in a euphemistic manner, \u201cSorry, Leader, I do not intend on publishing it.\u201dDeputy Station Head Jia\u2019s no longer no happy, \u201cThis is for your own good. We are trying to help your book do well and also make you famous!\u201dZhao Guozhou frowned, \u201cLittle Zhang, are you thinking of contacting a publisher yourself?\u201dThe faces of the other three Leaders by the side turned ashened, as they said bluntly towards Zhang Ye, \u201cYou are still in your probationary phase. The station thinks highly of you, so we are giving you a platform for your development, yet you are ungrateful towards it? Don\u2019t forget that your \u201cGhost Blows Out the Light\u201d was promoted by our station\u2019s programs. Our station has already produced a lot of momentum for you. You want to skip over the station to publish? Then shall we count how much the publicity costs?\u201d There was no doubt that there was a threat in his tone!If Zhang Ye did not hear this, it would have been fine. But upon hearing this, he was further angered. Aren\u2019t your words a bit unreasonable? Publicity costs? Then let me ask you, how did the novels in \u201cLate-night Ghost Stories\u201d come about in the past? Weren\u2019t they all very popular supernatural novels on the market? The station was using their novels\u2019 momentum to hold on to the listeners. They had even paid a considerable amount of copyright fees to the novel\u2019s author. So why have the roles been reversed when it came to me? You aren\u2019t paying me money, but now, I have to pay? Right, I\u2019m a staff of the station. I have the responsibility and obligation. That was why I used my novel to help draw in the audience for the station. From the beginning to the end, did I say anything about the copyright fees? I did not want the money, but how did it end up being me needing to pay publicity fees? And you are forcefully buying all my copyright?Zhang Ye suppressed all his anger in his heart. He also knew that it was not good to go against the Leaders, so he could only say, \u201cI do not intend to publish myself. I\u2019ve already said, I really do not intend on publishing.\u201dThe Leader stared widely, \u201cThen you can think about it now!\u201dZhang Ye in a thick-skinned manner, \u201cI do not have any such plans in the short term. Sorry, Leader!\u201dZhao Guozhou looked at him, \u201cLittle Zhang! Have you really thought through it?\u201d He was actually not surprised that Zhang Ye would not sell his copyright. This rascal was a person who said he would rather die than write a self-reflective essay. However, at the moment the mention of his bonus being deducted, this money-faced man had handed over a self-reflective essay in two minutes. To pull money out of a miser\u2019s hands would surely be extremely difficult.As they were speaking, they got the attention of quite a number of people nearby. Those people were listening to them talk.Deputy Station Head Jia laughed and seemed to be magnanimous, \u201cYoung people are indeed stubborn. Alright, the copyright is yours. If you do not want to use your copyright, the station will not force you!\u201dSince the three of them had finished their meal, they stood up and left.Zhao Guozhou pointed at Zhang Ye and said softly, \u201cYou man, you!\u201d Only he knew how much thought the station had gone through regarding the \u201cGhost Blows Out the Light\u201d copyright. In the past, the scope of miscellaneous business was limited to the copyright of audio books or copyright agreements with some websites. They would sell the radio station\u2019s high-quality audio resources; however, the revenue obtained from this was not a lot, so it was not a major development. This time, with Zhang Ye\u2019s novel being so popular, the station\u2019s leaders had seen another opportunity. As such, they created this false pretense of the power of attorney, hoping to gobble down the copyright to \u201cGhost Blows Out the Light\u201d, so that they could develop and expand their other forms of income, other than advertising. But who knew that Zhang Ye refused without a second thought!Deputy Station Head Jia may have made it sound unimportant, but Zhang Ye knew that things were not that simple. He was afraid that the station was about to apply some underhanded punishment!But so what?If I\u2019m not selling, it means I\u2019m not selling!Are you trying to steal the fruits of my labor without spending anything? Isn\u2019t this robbery!? Even if the station found a reason to fire Zhang Ye, Zhang Ye still had something left to say, which was the line in \u201cThe Song of the Stormy Petrel\u201d \u2013 Let the tempest come strike harder! I don\u2019t give a f**k who you are!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Hasn\u2019t the Leader already meted out punishment to him?\u201d\u201cBecause of the publishing of \u201cGhost Blows Out the Light\u201d, the station wanted to buy over the copyright. However, Zhang Ye was unimpressed, so he didn\u2019t sell it. The leader was embarrassed. If it was just any other Leader, it wouldn\u2019t be so bad, but this is Deputy Station Head Jia we are talking about. The station\u2019s Leader. If they would let him off, that would be strange!\u201d\u201cAiyo, there\u2019s such an incident?\u201d\u201cRight, he\u2019s done for.\u201d\u201cIt can\u2019t be that bad?\u201d\u201cCutting off the station\u2019s profit and long-drawn plans, how can it not be that bad? Watch, the Leader will do him in; they won\u2019t groom him any further.\u201d\u201cOh, what a shame. This kid\u2019s cultural upbringing is very good; he\u2019s a good sapling.\u201d\u201cI knew this day was coming. Zhang Ye doesn\u2019t know his place. He\u2019s a good person, but too stubborn. When you join the working world, how can your principles be that important anymore? He should know where to compromise and give in, otherwise he will suffer sooner or later. His \u201cThe Song of the Stormy Petrel\u201d was indeed good. I also approve of his literary skills, but that\u2019s only literature, only a poem. Work is still work; when you have to give in, you have to give in. Otherwise, if he follows his poem\u2019s \u201cLet the tempest strike harder\u201d, he wouldn\u2019t need to come in to work anymore. He would have offended all sorts of people.\u201dThe radio station is big, but its social circle is small. With a little hearsay, everyone heard the news.When Zhang Ye came back, he was surprised to see Tian Bin. His hand was wrapped up in gauze, like he had suffered an injury.The moment he saw Zhang Ye, Tian Bin gritted his teeth, like he had wanted to bite at him. But subsequently, Tian Bin was smiling again, like he was witnessing a joke. He\u2019d had a few drinks the day before and was not clear-minded, so he picked on Zhang Ye on Weibo and even encouraged his fans to curse at him. Who would have known that in the end, he and his fans were out-cursed by Zhang Ye. In his anger, Tian Bin smashed the ashtray beside his hands and accidentally cut himself. He even had to go to the hospital to get a few stitches. Tian Bin was so angry that he wanted to murder Zhang Ye, but who knew that when he arrived at the unit at noon, a surprise awaited him. Zhang Ye had offended the Leader. This was what\u2019s called retribution; at least, that is what Tian Bin thought. His anger from before had also dissipated.\u201cTeacher Zhang!\u201d Xiaofang rushed forward, \u201cThey said that you\u2026..\u201dZhang Ye waved her away, \u201cCarry on with your work. I\u2019ve finished recording the broadcast; go straighten it out.\u201dTeacher Feng, who was on good terms with him, also came forward, pulled him aside to a corner and spoke in a whisper, \u201cDid you really offend the station\u2019s Leader?\u201dZhang Ye smiled bitterly, \u201cI guess so.\u201dTeacher Feng concernedly asked, \u201cYou are really great. If the station wants your copyright, just sell it off to them. It\u2019s okay to earn less; after all, your future\u2019s here in radio hosting. If you don\u2019t sell, are you prepared to resign?\u201dZhang Ye replied unconcerned \u201cWhy should I resign? The copyright belongs to me. If the station wants to shortchange me, I won\u2019t sell. I did nothing wrong.\u201dTeacher Feng was at a loss for words, \u201cYou don\u2019t want to stay on? Do you think you can still stay on?\u201d\u201cWhy not?\u201d Zhang Ye rebutted, \u201cNot only will I stay on, I even want to do well.\u201d Such was his temper; he would not have it any other way.Teacher Feng shook his head, but didn\u2019t say anything further.Being a radio host, Zhang Ye had pondered repeatedly before applying for the job. Of course, he wouldn\u2019t resign because he had yet to achieve the results and experience. The late-night segment exploded into a well-known program? This result was not enough. Although the late-night program brought together many people, the audience base was still too little. As for those poems? At most, they could let Zhang Ye get around; it could not continuously bring him experience, nor fame. Zhang Ye\u2019s focus was still to gain more fame through using the radio station. At the very least, he had to win an award. This would be the very foundation needed for him to become famous in the future. Zhang Ye\u2019s horizons were very wide; naturally, he would not be stuck in the radio station. But deep inside, he knew that he couldn\u2019t make it without them. Right now, he would like to join the TV station, but that would require them to want him. Even if it was him, he could not become a TV host. The TV station was at least ten times more competitive than the radio station. Lots of people were queuing up to join the TV station, so why would they want him? Based on this height? Based on this image? Bull***t! Even if he worked backstage all his life, it wouldn\u2019t be his turn. So what if he had talent? Even with the cultural support he had from his world, it would have little effect. To be a TV host, not only do you need cultural learnings, but also a mixture of strength and qualifications. This is why Zhang Ye felt the basics in the radio station were very important. He needed to hone his skills here, before he can continue to climb up!Suddenly, Zhao Guozhou entered the office.\u201cDirector Zhao.\u201d\u201cDirector.\u201dA few people hurriedly greeted. Tian Bin did so, too.Zhao Guozhou looked at Tian Bin, \u201cHow\u2019s your injury?\u201dTian Bin quickly said, \u201cIt\u2019s not a problem; it was just a laceration. A few stitches was all it needed.\u201dWith a terse acknowledgement, Zhao Guozhou glanced at Zhang Ye, who was sitting at this seat. Suddenly, he clapped to attract the attention of everyone, \u201cEveryone, put down your work. I have two disciplinary matters to settle.\u201d Looking at Tian Bin, \u201cLittle Tian, although you are injured, I still need to give you a verbal reprimand. I have already received your self-reflective essay. Your attitude is pretty good. In consideration of your hard work and working attitude in the past, only one month of your bonus will be deducted. Never again!\u201dTian Bin promised, \u201cIt won\u2019t happen again.\u201d\u201cAlso, Zhang Ye.\u201d Although Zhang Ye had been dealt with, Zhao Guozhou suddenly went back on his word. \u201cLittle Zhang, your behavior was extremely bad. You used vulgarities and not only did you scold your own colleague, you even scolded the listeners who have always been supportive of us. You have caused an indelible effect on our station. The station\u2019s management are also taking this very seriously and have decided to revoke Zhang Ye\u2019s position as the host of \u201cLate-night Ghost Stories\u201d. He will become a stand-in host. The position will be taken up by Tian Bin. Here, I also want to warn everyone to remember that every word and action you do is representative of our station\u2019s image!\u201dMany people had already guessed it!However, there were still people who could not believe that the punishment dealt to Zhang Ye was so severe!Tian Bin was the most delighted person amongst them all. He immediately said, \u201cThank you, Leader. I promise that I will not disappoint the trust the station has put in me!\u201dZhang Ye also never expected the station to be ruthless. \u201cDirector Zhao, then will \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019 be taken off-air?\u201dZhao Guozhou said indifferently, \u201cWhy would it be taken off-air? Haven\u2019t you already finished recording? Once \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019 ends its broadcast, the next ghost story will be broadcasted by Tian Bin!\u201dFinished recording?This was pretty much slaughtering the donkey after it has done its job at the mill!Zhang Ye was vexed. This bro had worked overtime until 2-3 A.M. in the night every day over the past few days. He nearly did it without rest, but all he got in return was this? Not giving me the royalties I deserve, removing me from my post, yet still continuing to use my program to gain listenership for the station? One shouldn\u2019t kill after one has apologized! But what could he say? He was without any background or power. He could say nothing and could only blame himself. He had used vulgarities on Weibo, causing others to have something on him. Zhang Ye was a person who had a good memory. In the future, if he encountered something on the internet like this again, he would definitely\u2026definitely carry on cursing!This was Zhang Ye!No one could stop him with something he wanted to do!\u201cI have finished announcing the disciplinary matters. That would be all.\u201d Zhao Guozhou was about to leave.At this moment, no one expected Wang Xiaomei to stand forward, \u201cDirector Zhao, I saw the Weibo incident too. Even though Teacher Zhang had his faults, this matter was instigated by Teacher Tian. If the punishment for Teacher Zhang was so severe, I think it should be done so equally. We shouldn\u2019t let Teacher Tian go on a segment, right?\u201dZhang Ye was a rookie who had no experience. His performance was just above-average. However, Wang Xiaomei was different. She was the number one person of the Literature Channel. She was also a supporting pillar of the Beijing Radio Station. The words she said certainly had pull!Tian Bin\u2019s face flushed red and white. However, he did not dare open his mouth, as it wasn\u2019t his time and place.Zhao Guozhou stared deeply at Wang Xiaomei, \u201cTeacher Xiaomei, no matter what problems Little Tian has, he did not scold anyone. He had still paid attention to the repercussions.\u201dWang Xiaomei said, \u201cThen I think this punishment is not fair. If Teacher Tian can go on segment, then Teacher Zhang should be given a chance to mend his ways.\u201dTeacher Feng hesitated before looking up, \u201cMy \u201cOld and Young Story Club\u201d is about to be axed. I heard that the station has arranged for other segments to replace it. However, there should be about a dozen or so more episodes to be recorded. I have already begun the retirement procedures last week. It is quite pointless for me to host it any further. Why not let Teacher Little Zhang host my segment? I\u2019m already old. My body is also not good. I really don\u2019t have the energy to carry on broadcasting.\u201dZhao Guozhou\u2019s eyebrows ticked, \u201cOld Feng, there should be a beginning and an end. You have already broadcast your segment for five years. You want to give up at the final critical moment?\u201dTeacher Feng sighed, \u201cI think it\u2019s best to hand it over to the young people. I only want to retire peacefully now.\u201dAfter a few seconds of silence, Zhao Guozhou could only say, \u201cAlright, then. In that case, tomorrow, Little Zhang will host \u2018Old and Young Story Club\u2019.\u201d Since the segment had only about a dozen days left, it was pretty meaningless.Tian Bin and many others felt the same, too. It was meaningless.However, Zhang Ye did not agree. At this moment, he felt warmth in his heart. An indescribable feeling surged from deep within his heart. He had never expected that someone would help him at this moment. After Zhao Guozhou left, Zhang Ye rushed to Wang Xiaomei\u2019s table, \u201cTeacher Wang, thank you very much.\u201dWang Xiaomei said without expression, \u201cYou had helped me relieve the problem on my program last time. Treat it as me returning the favor.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d After saying that, Zhang Ye went to Teacher Feng, \u201cTeacher Feng, thank you very much. I really do not know what to say.\u201dTeacher Feng laughed, \u201cRetiring tomorrow is also retiring. Retiring a dozen days later is also retiring. What difference is that to me? You don\u2019t have to thank me. In fact, I can\u2019t help you much. You are, in my opinion, the best sapling in the station. Don\u2019t blame me for always nagging you. In fact, I actually like that bad temper of yours. You are identical to when I was young. Hehe. I also do not wish to see you being put down like that. My segment will be handed over to you tomorrow. This segment is my child. You must treat it well. Even though it will be taken off-air in a dozen or so episodes, you must do it diligently. Can you agree to that?\u201dImmediately, Zhang Ye felt a heavy burden. He said confidently, \u201cI can agree to that!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It just can\u2019t be switched on. Phew, it\u2019s so hot!\u201dIn the morning, a veteran broadcaster, Wu Datao, had tinkered with it all day without fixing it. He could not handle the heat well, so after fussing with it until his body was covered he sweat, he eventually gave up. He turned his head to look at the people in the office. The clerk was not around. Everyone else was busy with their work. All of them were broadcasting hosts. As such, he looked towards Zhang Ye, \u201cLittle Zhang, the air-con is spoilt. Go downstairs to the front desk and get them to contact Maintenance.\u201dZhang Ye looked back, \u201cDon\u2019t we just need to make a phone call?\u201dWu Datao said, \u201cWe don\u2019t have Maintenance\u2019s telephone number here. Also, we need to fill in a maintenance request form at the front desk to tell them which air-con it is.\u201dZhang Ye was unwilling to do so, \u201cI\u2019m still busy. I\u2019ll get to it in a while.\u201dWu Datao no longer called Zhang Ye \u2018Teacher Little Zhang\u2019. Back then, he could chat with Zhang Ye. He had also complimented him when Zhang Ye\u2019s segment became popular. However, now, his attitude had completely changed. He ordered him around like a normal clerk. According to what Zhang Ye heard, he had good personal ties with Zhao Guozhou and was a close associate of Director Zhao. There was even talk that said that he was related to Director Zhao\u2019s wife.Li Si came back over there. He was holding onto a basket of letters. It was as if they had all discussed this beforehand, as he came to Zhang Ye and said, \u201cLittle Zhang, the letters from the listeners are here. Find yours and then give the rest to everyone.\u201dZhang Ye retorted, \u201cGiving them out? Me?\u201dLi Si said, \u201cI still have other things to do.\u201dAfter putting down the basket, he left. A few days back, Li Si had already took a softer stance with Zhang Ye. He had taken the initiative to greet Zhang Ye. After all, the power was in the victor. But now, with Zhang Ye offending the Leader, not only was Zhao Guozhou provoked, he had even offended the station\u2019s Leader. Li Si\u2019s attitude had reverted back to that of the past.Tian Bin also chimed in, as he pointed towards the water fountain beside Zhang Ye, \u201cLittle Zhang, we are running out of water soon. In a while, go change it since you don\u2019t have any work to do now.\u201dEverybody is hitting a man while he is down!Zhang Ye let out a sneer!It was as if the entire office\u2019s attitude towards Zhang Ye had changed immediately. Other than three other people, Wang Xiaomei, Teacher Feng and Xiaofang, the rest had all begun bossing him around. If they did not do that, they would ignore him. They did not say anything or greet Zhang Ye when they saw him. It was as if he did not exist. They were all experienced employees. So how could they not be aware of what was happening? The station was intending to strike down Zhang Ye. They did not fire him, despite removing him from his hosting program. This was to teach him a lesson, so as to let him obediently hand the copyright to \u201cGhost Blows Out the Light\u201d over to the station. However, those who had come into contact with Zhang Ye over the past few days knew that with Zhang Ye\u2019s stubborn temper, he would never agree to it.Hence, in everyone\u2019s opinion, Zhang Ye\u2019s career as a broadcaster had come to an end. No one could save him. So why would they need to establish good relationships with him? Firstly, it was not necessarily. Secondly, they had to do so. They were completely different from Wang Xiaomei and Teacher Feng. Teacher Xiaomei was a pillar of support for the station. The station\u2019s management attached great importance to her, so no one would dare touch her. Teacher Feng was about to retire in a few days. He was also an old comrade that had worked in the station for decades. So everyone had to give him face. Besides, he was about to retire, so what could you do? The other people were different. They still had to carry on working under Deputy Station Head Jia and Director Zhao for a long time to come. Since the Leader had ordered a \u201cgag order\u201d, would they mingle with Zhang Ye in a friendly manner? Do you think they felt they had lived too long?In an afternoon, Zhang Ye could be said to have been bossed around everywhere.Xiaofang, who had just returned after finishing her work, saw how Zhang Ye was treated the moment she entered the office. Her eyes turned red with anger!\u201cLittle Zhang, what\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t I get you to change the water jug?\u201d\u201cSince you don\u2019t have any work now, why are you putting on airs?\u201dWu Datao and Tian Bin began echoing each other. Even Li Si, who was a small assistant, looked down on Zhang Ye. Zhang Ye had been completely marginalized!Teacher Feng could not take it any longer, \u201cAren\u2019t all of you also very free? If you have the energy to boss others around, why don\u2019t you make the phone call to solve it yourself?\u201d\u201cTeacher Feng, you are still speaking up for him?\u201d Wu Datao was also annoyed by Zhang Ye. \u201cLook at him; does he even look like he is giving the respect a rookie should give to an elder?\u201dXiaofang was also bursting with anger, \u201cAll of you are just taking advantage of your seniority to bully others!\u201dTian Bin had also endured Xiaofang for a long time, \u201cDo you think a lowly clerk like you has the right to speak?\u201dAfter being shouted at, Xiaofang nearly teared up. She felt wronged!Zhang Ye\u2019s temper also began boiling. This was the first time he opened his mouth, \u201cWhat are you shouting for!? Just because your voice is loud!? If you have anything to say, say it right at me! Why are you oppressing a young lady!? Say it at me! Come!\u201d Zhang Ye slammed the table. He turned the atmosphere tense. Immediately, there was silence!\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Tian Bin did not shout back at Zhang Ye. He was mentally scarred after the war of words last night. He knew he could not win against Zhang Ye in a battle of words.The sound of footsteps could be heard as Zhao Guozhou came out from his office, \u201cI could hear all of you shouting from outside! What are you doing? Do you think this is a house that belongs to all of you!? This is an office! It is where you work!\u201dAlthough he had used the words \u201call of you\u201d, Zhang Ye knew that he was saying it to him. Heh, I ignored all of you, and to think all of you thought there was no end to it? Any Tom, Dick and Harry wants to step on me? Did I provoke all of you!? Zhang Ye did not shout back at Zhao Guozhou. In that second, he recalled the item that he had obtained from the Lottery a few days ago. It was the one-time consumable item he had obtained while recording in front of the sponsors, the \u201cUnlucky Halo\u201d. Actually, Zhang Ye did not understand the use of such an item. He had not planned on using it. However, he wanted to try using it today. As such, he opened his game ring\u2019s interface and took out the black angel-like halo from his inventory. He followed the instructions to wear it on his head. The halo began spinning, as an invisible wave spread out into the surroundings, forming a large domain!Ding![ Unlucky Halo in Effect! ][ Effective for 5 minutes. Countdown begins! ]The item\u2019s description was, \u201cTriggering certain conditions will allow everyone around the player to enter a state of bad luck.\u201dZhang Ye wanted to see what the condition was. After using it, he looked towards the people around him. However, he realized nothing had changed. Everyone was still fine.What the heck?The item had no effect?One minute later, Zhao Guozhou left.Just as Zhang Ye was feeling depressed over it, Wu Datao turned forceful once again. The air-conditioner was still not working after he tinkered with it. He shouted, \u201cZhang Ye, are you going or not!?\u201dZhang Ye retorted back, \u201cDon\u2019t you have legs?\u201d\u201cKid, are you picking a quarrel?\u201d Wu Datao raged. However, just as he was about to reprimand Zhang Ye, sparks from the air-conditioner\u2019s power source jumped out. It was as if it had short-circuited. With a buzz, it splashed onto Wu Datao\u2019s hands. Wu Datao gave out a terrifying cry as his body tensed up for a second. Only after the current left his body did he slump to the ground. Some of his hair was standing from being electrocuted. He was dazed from the shock!\u201cAiyah!\u201d\u201cTeacher Wu! How are you?\u201d\u201cThis crappy air-con! I already said we should have changed it!\u201dLi Si pointed at Zhang Ye as he reprimanded, \u201cTeacher Wu told you to go to the front desk to file the maintenance report! But you didn\u2019t go! Look at what happened!?\u201dJust as Li Si finished speaking, the glass pane on the window beside him shattered without any warning. A fluorescent-colored rubber ball had flown in. It was one of those balls that could bounce up very high when thrown at the ground. Some naughty child must have thrown it, downstairs. Unfortunately, it had smashed into their office\u2019s window, straight into Li Si\u2019s forehead. As the elasticity of the rubber ball was very great, a thud, followed by a painful cry, was heard as Li Si fell to the ground!\u201cLi Si!\u201d\u201cWho threw it!\u201d\u201cAre you alright?\u201dTian Bin took this opportunity to shout at Zhang Ye, \u201cLook at what you have done! All of this is because of you!\u201dLi Si\u2019s forehead was bleeding slightly. The glass fragments had cut him, but it was not very serious.Zhang Ye laughed with anger, \u201cBecause of me? A child throwing something downstairs is because of me? The electrical leakage of the air-con is because of me? Everything that goes wrong is because of me? What sort of logic is that!?\u201dJust as Tian Bin was about to shout again, the water fountain beside him, which did not have much water left in it, let out an explosive sound. Boom. The pipe broke and boiling hot water from within came splashing down onto Tian Bin\u2019s feet. Tian Bin yelled out, as he fell to the ground, while holding his foot. Thankfully, due to his clothes, he had not been badly scalded. However, after taking off his socks, he realized that a large portion of his foot was now red. He gritted his teeth from the pain!\u201cAh!\u201dOutside, Tian Bin\u2019s wife, who also worked in the station, happened to come in. Seeing her husband grimacing in pain on the ground in front of Zhang Ye, she immediately went into a craze without a second thought, \u201cZhang, what did you do!? You dare to hit someone?\u201dTeacher Feng immediately said, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t Little Zhang!\u201dTian Bin\u2019s wife ignored it as she swung the plastic folder she held in her hands right at Zhang Ye! Before the folder could be thrown, she lost her balance. Her eight- or nine-centimeter high heels caused her body to form an angle with the ground. Bada! The heel broke. Tian Bin\u2019s wife twisted her foot as she fell to the ground. She was wearing a skirt today. It was also a tight skirt, so this got good with a tearing sound. Tian Bin\u2019s wife\u2019s skirt tore. It went from bottom to top. A pair of red lacy underwear was suddenly exposed in front of everyone!Tian Bin was dumbfounded!Li Si was alarmed!Wu Datao was dazed!Everyone was stunned!Zhang Ye heard the game ring indicating that the Unlucky Halo\u2019s effects had ended before he came around. As the person closest, he showed his humanitarian spirit. He quickly threw his overcoat onto where Tian Bin\u2019s wife had exposed herself. He, too, felt speechless. Immediately, he turned towards Tian Bin, Li Si and Wu Datao, \u201cAre all of you alright? I have some bandaids here. Eh. Can you get up? Do you need to go to the hospital?\u201d He now understood that the condition needed for the Unlucky Halo to work was if someone had taken the initiative to mess with the player. Nothing happened in the first minute. However, the moment Wu Datao found fault with him, and when Tian Bin and Li Si began oppressing Zhang Ye, the Unlucky Halo activated its effects!As Zhang Ye spoke, no one answered!Everyone was looking at Zhang Ye, as if he was Hades!Teacher Wu got electrocuted? Li Si got hit by a bouncing ball from downstairs? Teacher Tian got hit to the floor by a water fountain? Teacher Tian\u2019s wife twisted her ankle by her own high heels? In that split second, many people recalled the strange incident of Tian Bin falling to the ground three times in the office. He had stepped on a lunch box lid! The fluorescent light tube\u2019s explosion!It was too much a coincidence!Are you a f**king jinx from the stars!?In that instant, at least four colleagues who were beside Zhang Ye dodged to a distance about two meters away from him instinctively. No one dared to approach him!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The one that cursed online?\u201d\u201cRight, that\u2019s him. Everyone is saying he\u2019s odd. It\u2019s like he knows some evil mystic techniques!\u201d\u201cHaha, what day and age is it? Why are you still so superstitious? How can that be? Even if his \u201cGhost Blows Out the Light\u201d is so well-written, it is just a novel.\u201d\u201cYou dont\u2019 know what happened at the Literature Channel? A few people who offended Zhang Ye all encountered bad luck. One got scalded by hot water, one got electrocuted by the air-con, another got hit by a bouncing ball from out the window and another one twisted her ankle because of her heels. And finally, falling down repeatedly after a florescent light tube exploded. How do you explain this? Why were all those who did not offend him alright?\u201d\u201cAh? There was such a thing?\u201d\u201cWhy would I lie to you? Everyone is talking about it. Old Sun, if you see Zhang Ye in the future, stay far away from him. This guy is really strange!\u201dTwo people in the Music Channel whispered.This similar scene happened in many parts of the radio station.Today, Zhang Ye showed up\u00a0late. When he reached upstairs, people had already begun working, so the corridor was empty. When Zhang Ye reached the door to the Literature Channel\u2019s office, he heard Zhao Guozhou\u2019s voice coming from within. He pushed open the door, \u201cSorry, there was a traffic jam.\u201d This rascal, of course, was not in a traffic jam. He took the subway to work. He had overslept. It was also because he felt like slacking off at work. He was furious with the way the management and his colleagues had treated him. Since his segment had been taken away from him, he no longer had much passion for work.The moment he appeared, the entire office turned silent!Every pair of eyes landed on him!Zhang Ye felt a bit creeped out as he gave a cough before returning to his seat. Only then did he see a youth standing beside Zhao Guozhou. He was about the same age as Zhang Ye. He was in his early twenties and was very handsome. He was the type that one would consider a standard good-looking guy. His hair was short, he was 1.8 meters tall and a bit thin.Zhao Guozhou pretended that he did not see Zhang Ye, as he carried on, \u201cI\u2019ve already said what I need to say. Today, I\u2019ll introduce to everyone a newcomer, Jia Yan. He is a fresh graduate and his broadcasting ability is excellent. From today, everyone will be colleagues. When \u201cOld and Young Story Club\u201d finishes next week, that time slot will be replaced by a new segment, \u201cSoaring Youth\u201d. This segment has been planned over a long period of time by the station, and having spent large amounts of money. The position of a broadcasting host will be handed over to Jia Yan. Teachers, please guide him, so that Little Jia can do well.\u201dEveryone immediately applauded.Jia Yan took the opportunity to speak, \u201cSeniors, in the future, I hope you would correct me if there is anything I\u2019m lacking with.\u201d\u201cYour office seat\u2026\u201d Zhao Guozhou searched around as he looked towards Zhang Ye, \u201cLittle Zhang, go sit with Teacher Feng. Teacher Feng\u2019s desk is quite large, so grab a chair there. Little Jia, in the future, this will be your office desk. Work hard and don\u2019t let us down.\u201dJia Yan said, \u201cYes, I will, Director Zhao.\u201dThere were no more desks in the office, so Zhang Ye was thrown away.Zhang Ye could not help but laugh deep down. Surprisingly, he did not say a word as he moved his stuff and stood up.Just as Zhang Ye\u2019s items was about to lose balance to the point of nearly touching a passing-by Tian Bin\u2019s arm, it was as if Tian Bin was a cat that had its tail stepped on. His hair stood up as he hurriedly retreated away. The chair under his ass even pulled back with a screeching noise.Zhang Ye, \u201c\u2026\u201d. He carried on walking.When he walked pass Li Si, whose forehead was covered by a piece of gauze, he immediately turned sideways. It was as if there was a danger zone within a one-meter radius of Zhang Ye, so one needed to stay at least two meters away.On his way, Zhang Ye sure felt it was lively. Everywhere he passed by, his colleagues would all dodge. It was as if they were shunning the plague!Holy sh*t!Must all of you go to that extent?Zhang Ye was the person who felt most speechless!Similarly, the newcomer, Jia Yan, was also speechless. He was unaware of what was happening, having just arrived at the unit. Seeing everyone\u2019s attitude towards Zhang Ye, he was wondering, \u201cJust who is this man? Some people were unpopular, but who the f**k has seen such an unpopular person!? How unpopular are you?\u201dThe newcomer\u2019s introduction carried on.Zhang Ye was in no mood to listen as he whispered to Teacher Feng, \u201cSorry, Teacher Feng. Both of us need to squeeze together at a table. What the heck! Who is that person? It seems the Leader highly appreciates him?\u201dTeacher Feng whispered back, \u201cI heard that he is a relative of Deputy Station Head Jia.\u201d\u201cBoth of them have the surname, \u2018Jia\u2019? No wonder.\u201d Zhang Ye was enlightened. He had been forced to his current state all because of Deputy Station Head Jia. Of course, he did not have a good impression of Jia Yan.After completing the procedures, Jia Yan had officially entered the profession. He also rushed to form bonds with his colleagues. A few young ladies in the station even rushed forward to chat with him happily. Male colleagues also had a good chat with him. Without asking, all of them knew that he was a relative of Deputy Station Head Jia. Even if one did not build a good relationship with him, he was not someone they could afford to offend. If he were to speak ill of you in front of the Leader, then you would be in trouble.\u201cLittle Jia, if you have anything you do not know, feel free to ask me.\u201d\u201cSure thing, Teacher Wu. Sorry for troubling you.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need to stand on ceremony. We are a family the moment you entered this office.\u201dOnly Zhang Ye and a small minority of people ignored Jia Yan, as they did what they had to do.Jia Yan was still alright in the beginning. After humbly interacting with his colleagues, he looked around and came to Teacher Feng, \u201cMay I ask if you are Teacher Feng?\u201dTeacher Feng nodded and shook hands with him, \u201cThat\u2019s me.\u201d\u201cHello. The Leader has arranged for me to take over your segment, so I will need to consult you if there\u2019s anything I do not understand.\u201d Jia Yan said, smiling.Teacher Feng smiled slightly, \u201cSure. No problem.\u201dHowever, the tone in Jia Yan\u2019s next sentence changed, \u201cI have already planned the theme for two episodes of the program. \u201cSoaring Youth\u201d is a show that has to do with stories and matters regarding youths and society, so I actually have a slight problem. As my theme is more pertinent to actual matters, you should know that the popularity of the topic is limited. After a while, it would lose its popularity, so it cannot be delayed. I heard from the station that you would be retiring. Hence, I\u2019m asking for your opinion if I can begin broadcasting my program this coming Monday. If it is delayed another ten days or so, then what I\u2019ve come up with might not be relevant anymore.\u201dTeacher Feng, who was still holding his hand, turned stiff, \u201cYou are telling me to end \u201cOld and Young Story Club\u201d early?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s my intention. Ending a show ten episodes early wouldn\u2019t make much of a difference. I think we should be looking forward. I also hope that my segment for that time slot would have a higher listenership rate.\u201d Jia Yan said in a dignified manner.Teacher Feng\u2019s expression sank, \u201cImpossible!\u201dTeacher Feng was the most senior person in the office. He was a nice guy and had always been well-liked. A few old comrades who had good relations with Teacher Feng could not bear listening any further.\u201cLittle Jia, what\u2019s the meaning of this?\u201d\u201cAre you trying to put on airs, having just arrived?\u201d\u201cThe ending to the segment was decided by the Leader; do you think you can change as you wish?\u201dJia Yan hurriedly said, \u201cTeachers, you have misunderstood what I meant. I absolutely do not have such a thought. I only want to make my segment do well. I have already told the Leader about my thoughts. The Leader told me to discuss it with Teacher Feng, so I came over to ask. The first two episodes really need to be expedited!\u201dWang Xiaomei frowned, and said to him, \u201cExpedited? Then why don\u2019t you adjust your own segment. If it\u2019s old, let it go. Can\u2019t you create something new? Why must you adjust someone else\u2019s segment?\u201dThere were people who helped Jia Yan.Tian Bin said, \u201cEnding early or late will\u00a0have the same outcome.\u201dWu Datao also said, \u201cLittle Jia is a newcomer. We should give him room for opportunities. The future world belongs to young people like him. It isn\u2019t such a serious matter, right?\u201dThe sounds of sparse footsteps from outside could be heard.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? What\u2019s the ruckus about?\u201d A management inspection team had arrived. The inspections by the higher-ups had no fixed schedule. It purely depended on the mood of the Leader. Every now and then they would take their rounds.\u201cStation Head Jia.\u201d\u201cStation Head Jia.\u201d\u201cChief Zhang.\u201dEveryone stood up.Deputy Station Head Jia asked in a long tone, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201dJia Yan saw his grandfather but he pretended not to know him. He then explained what had happened.Deputy Station Head Jia gave a long \u201cOh\u201d and put his foot down, \u201cThe ending time of the segment was just preliminarily decided. It can be adjusted at any time. Since your segment has its requirements, then let\u2019s push it forward by a week.\u201d Looking towards Teacher Feng, \u201cOld Feng, can you make way for the newcomer, please?\u201dWhat else could Teacher Feng say? His face turned pale with anger! Just as what he said to Zhang Ye, he had always treated his segment as his child. As its listenership had always been around\u00a0last, there was no way to help it if it were to be axed. However, just because he was a relative of the station\u2019s Leader, the decided ending date was overturned? I still have not retired yet! Now you are sending me off already?The matter was settled.The inspecting management left.Jia Yan got his wishes, \u201cSorry, Teacher Feng. My segment is really in a rush. Please don\u2019t bother about me. About the handing over of the segment\u2026\u201dZhang Ye very impolitely interrupted him. He was already mad while watching from the side. The moment he spoke, he said some harsh words, \u201c\u2019Old and Young Story Club\u2019 will be mine from today onwards. Anything you need to say should be said to me. However, you don\u2019t have to say any more, nor do you need to consider the handing over of segments. I can solemnly tell you that this segment, \u2018Old and Young Story Club\u2019 will not end its broadcast. From today forward, I will let the segment reach greater heights. As for you, take a number and honestly queue up. It\u2019s not your turn yet! In the future, it will still not be your turn either! So there\u2019s no need to be impatient!\u201dWhat?\u201cOld and Young Story Club\u201d will not end its broadcast?Tian Bin nearly laughed out loud after hearing this. Could you change what the Leader has already decided?Jia Yan also found it ridiculous, \u201cI\u2019ve heard that you are the previous host of \u2018Late-night Ghost Stories\u2019, Zhang Ye, right? I really do not know what you are talking about!\u201dHe did not know, neither did anyone else!Would not hand it over? Would not end its broadcast? Are you dreaming!?This is already a sure thing! How are you going to reverse the situation? Do you think you can let \u201cOld and Young Story Club\u201d go from last to first in listenership rates? Today was Wednesday! There were only five days left until Sunday! You have really made a hilarious joke! You really aren\u2019t afraid of saying anything?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 39": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I\u2019m Really a SuperstarCH 38Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 38:\u00a0Zhang Ye narrates \u201cSnow White\u201d!Chapter title is a spoiler, highlight it to read it now, or see it at the bottom.People scattered.They all returned to their seats.No one cared about the harsh words Zhang Ye said. This was because, be it Tian Bin, Jia Yan or Wang Xiaomei and company, everyone knew that it was impossible. Not even Zhang Ye, even a famous broadcasting host in the industry, with an extreme amount of fame would not be able to revive \u201cOld and Young Story Club\u201d from the dead in five days. Everyone worked in the same industry. They knew the limitations and bottlenecks of the segment. Why was \u201cOld and Young Story Club\u201d always low on the ratings? This was probably fated.This segment was in the afternoon time slot, which was 12 noon to 1 P.M. The segment was to tell stories like children\u2019s fairy tales. From the moment the segment was established, it already had a pitfall and a limitation. As a result, this segment had never become popular. In recent years, it carried on returning low ratings.Why? This was because it was no longer like years ago. There was too much information in present-day society. Communication methods and technology were improving by the day. People no longer used the radio to obtain information. Typically, children were still in school during this afternoon time slot, other than during Winter and Summer breaks. Those who were not in school, because they were too young, would not be able to understand the stories. Those who were in school did not have the time to listen. This created this awkward situation.Furthermore, children\u2019s literature was becoming more and more downtrodden. Be it the quality or quantity of works, they were all decreasing. If one carefully counted, the more famous new fairy tales this year only included \u201cCan Kites Fly?\u201d and \u201cTong Tong\u2019s Day\u201d. However, these two stories could not be split up and broadcast over an entire year, right? Children might not even listen to it. The same old stories were listened to over and over again. Those which were famous had been heard by everyone. Those that were not famous were not well-liked by everyone. So in such an environment, who would listen to the radio?Not only the Beijing Radio Station, even many radio stations all over the country were cancelling their children story segments. The market was as such. No one could reverse the situation.Hence, Zhang Ye\u2019s words were treated as a joke. Many people did not even bother retorting. There was no meaning behind having an exchange and clarification.\u201cLittle Zhang.\u201d Teacher Feng also said, \u201cYou really think so?\u201dZhang Ye said in a determined fashion, \u201cI didn\u2019t have this thought yesterday, but I have it now!\u201d This rascal was a warrior. He was still resigning himself to despair before, but now, after seeing Deputy Station Head Jia and his family challenging him, his fighting spirit was rekindled. He was full of energy!\u201cYou don\u2019t understand the situation.\u201d Teacher Feng wanted to explain it to him.However, Zhang Ye refused to listen, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to speak any further. I do not need to understand the situation either. You don\u2019t have to care what I do. You just focus on your retirement procedures. Hand everything over to me. I, Zhang Ye, will guarantee you that \u2018Old and Young Story Club\u2019 will soar to even greater heights! I will not let your baby end in my hands! If you believe me, then don\u2019t leave the unit first. Aren\u2019t there still five days left? Five days is sufficient! See how I make our program do well! \u2018Soaring Youth\u2019? I\u2019ll let that Jia Yan never be able to have his segment!\u201dUpon hearing that, Teacher Feng also felt a little excited, \u201cYou really can do it? But the segment\u2019s stories are all those fairy tales from the past. No matter how good your broadcasting skills are, everyone only cares about the story.\u201dZhang Ye flatly said, \u201cThen I\u2019ll write my own stories!\u201d\u201cYou do not have children. You won\u2019t understand the mentality of children!\u201d Teacher Feng cautioned him, \u201cThis is different from writing a novel or composing a poem!\u201dZhang Ye was confident, \u201cWait and see. I\u2019ll make them not be able to speak a single word!\u201d\u201cAlright, then go ahead and try. It\u2019s not early anymore. Let\u2019s go to the recording studio. On the way, I\u2019ll tell you things you need to pay attention to.\u201d Teacher Feng brought Zhang Ye along with him.However, just as they took a few steps, Li Si came forward, \u201cTeacher Feng, Teacher Jia just went to Recording Studio #3 to record his new segment. You will need to wait.\u201dTeacher Feng\u2019s voice changed, \u201cWhich Teacher Jia?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Teacher Jia, Jia Yan.\u201d Li Si no longer spoke to Teacher Feng as respectfully as in the past. There was no need to for a person that was about to leave. As for Zhang Ye, there was even less need to do so, as he had been blacklisted by the Leader. \u201cI actually told him that your segment had already reserved it, but Teacher Jia got an expedited approval from the Leader, so I had to give it to him. Well, Recording Studio #4 will be free in an hour.\u201dTeacher Feng said angrily, \u201cIt will nearly be 12 noon soon! How can we record an hour later!? At that moment, it will be a live broadcast!\u201d\u201cPlease don\u2019t get angry at me. This was not decided by me.\u201d Li Si said.Zhang Ye had already seen through him, as he appeared unfazed, \u201cTeacher Feng, don\u2019t worry. Let\u2019s do a live broadcast today. I happen to like live broadcasts!\u201dTeacher Feng was unwilling, \u201cThis is the first time you are going on the segment. You have also never narrated such a story. If there\u2019s a mistake, you\u2026\u201d\u201cThere won\u2019t be. I won\u2019t make a mistake!\u201d Zhang Ye said to Li Si, \u201cReserve the live broadcast room for us!\u201dLi Si extremely disliked Zhang Ye\u2019s tone. But after the spooky event that happened yesterday, he did not dare to challenge Zhang Ye. He did not even dare to enter a two meters radius from him, so he could only obediently follow the instructions. As the saying goes, kind people will be bullied. After being aware of Zhang Ye\u2019s powers and sinister side, everyone became well-behaved. And Li Si was one of them. He did not wish to be hit in the forehead another time. His wound was still hurting right now!\u2026Before noon.Live broadcast studio #6.Today, other than Zhang Ye and Teacher Feng, there was no one else. Everyone knew that Zhang Ye was doomed. This segment was also doomed. So naturally, no one had the mind to listen to their live broadcast.It was still before the segment\u2019s scheduled time. Zhang Ye took this opportunity to open his game ring. After the war of words, his Reputation points had constantly increased. With the Reputation gained from yesterday\u2019s \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019, Zhang Ye already had another 100,000 Reputation points today. Without any hesitation, he bought a \u201cMemory Search Capsule\u201d. He searched through the fairy tales he had read when he was still young, reinforcing the memory!One story!Three stories!Five stories!The capsule\u2019s time was over!Zhang Ye had a great harvest before he opened his eyes. His eyes were clear and sparkling.\u201cWe are about to begin.\u201d Teacher Feng cautioned him. He began the countdown. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. He turned on the volume and said amiably, \u201cHello, children. It\u2019s our \u2018Old and Young Story Club\u2019 segment today again. I am your old friend, Grandpa Feng. Today, I will introduce a new friend to everyone. His name is Uncle Zhang Ye. The following story and segment will be told by Uncle Zhang.\u201dZhang Ye introduced himself, \u201cHello, children. I am Zhang Ye. You can call me Brother and you can also call me Uncle. Hehe.\u201dAfter handing over the segment, Teacher Feng turned off his volume and signaled to Zhang Ye. As he walked out, he looked backwards. He did not remain in the live broadcasting studio. It was not that Teacher Feng was assured of Zhang Ye; in contrast, he was overly worried. As such, he did not even dare watch or listen, for his heart could not take it.With Zhang Ye left alone, Zhang Ye felt even more calm!\u201cOld and Young Story Club\u201d had a bottleneck? It had its limitations? Those were all excuses!Zhang Ye did not believe in such crap. He still wanted to revive this segment! What was his method? It was to use the fairy tales from his world. His brain was filled with all sort of literature resources. Let\u2019s not even talk about one story a day, he could even narrate ten stories a day for a full month without a hitch! Furthermore, every story would be something never heard of in this world! Zhang Ye had even specially checked on the internet. Just like \u201cGhost Blows Out the Light\u201d, this world did not have the famous fairy tale authors like Hans Christian Anderson or the Brothers Grimm!Lacking in children\u2019s literature?Others were worried, but he wasn\u2019t! His whole being was a resource!Zhang Ye began to speak the moment he opened his mouth. The Memory Search Capsule had allowed him to reproduce the fairy tales without missing a word. The speed at which he narrated was different from that of narrating \u201cGhost Blows Out the Light\u201d. This was narrated to children, so the speed had to be done slowly. Furthermore, he could not use the tone of narrating a horror story. He had to use a soft and gentle tone. He even needed to pinch his throat to change his pitch, so as to let children feel closer to him. These basics had been completely learned by Zhang Ye when he was in college. Zhang Ye was not weaker than anyone else in these professional classes. He was only lacking a stage from which he could perform. Hence, for a person like him who had poor looks, he greatly valued work in the radio station. He needed to do well. He needed to reverse the situation with \u201cOld and Young Story Club\u201d. It was both for himself and also for Teacher Feng who had been kind to him!\u201cToday, I\u2019ll tell you a children\u2019s fairy tale. Once upon a time, long, long ago, a king and queen ruled over a distant land. Both of them wished for a child. So they sincerely prayed to God, \u2018God! We are a good King and Queen. Please give us a child!\u2019 Soon after that, the kind queen gave birth to a baby girl, who had skin white as snow, cheeks as red as apples\u2026The people of this world did not understand.However, if anyone from Zhang Ye\u2019s world heard this, they would definitely blurt it out. Yes, Zhang Ye was narrating the famous, and widely-known all around the world, fairy tale that everyone had heard before\u2026\u201dNews Broadcast\u201d!Alright, let\u2019s not joke!*Cough* It was \u201cSnow White and the Seven Dwarves\u201d!Chapter 38: Zhang Ye narrates \u201cSnow White\u201d!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Clearly, Director Zhao was intending to groom him.Jia Yan held the form as he said to everyone, \u201cThe Leader has given me this task. Actually, I\u2019m quite nervous, as I keep thinking that announcing the ratings is a task that can offend people. Hehe.\u201d Tian Bin and Wu Datao kindly smiled with him to match up with him.What was so funny?Zhang Ye scoffed. He was thinking, \u201cAren\u2019t your laughing points too low? Anything makes you laugh?\u201d\u201cFirst place, Talk About the World.\u201d\u201cSecond place, Entertainment Daily.\u201d\u201cThird place, Late-night Ghost Stories.\u201dThe top rankings still remained the same. It was already fixed.Zhang Ye only cared about the ratings for \u201cOld and Young Story Club\u201d. This was because it was his only segment now. Not only him, there was also Teacher Feng who had hosted \u201cOld and Young Story Club\u201d for many years. He did not believe a bit of Zhang Ye\u2019s bold claims. He did not believe a wish that he could not fulfill for all these years could be fulfilled by him. However, the passion Zhang Ye had had infected Teacher Feng. He was also looking forward to it.Tenth place\u2026Twentieth place\u2026When Jia Yan read to the end, Zhang Ye\u2019s segment had finally appeared. It was unknown if it was intentional and his lips curled, \u201cLast place, \u2018Old and Young Story Club\u2019, rating of 0.28%.\u201d Lining the bottom once again! It was the first from the back once again! This was not only just last in the Literature Channel, it was definitely within the bottom three in the entire Beijing Radio Station!Teacher Feng sighed. He also knew that this would be the outcome.Zhang Ye nearly cursed vulgarities. What the f**k! How can it be so bad? This was \u201cSnow White\u201d! It was his world\u2019s greatest fairy tale! Can it not be so ridiculous? And the rating was that pathetic, at zero point something percent? It had no change from before? That should not have happened! The story of \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019 and the few poems he threw out had already proven that the culture of the two worlds were interchangeable. How could it not work!?Tian Bin slanted his eyes at Zhang Ye.Li Si and Wu Datao also looked at Zhang Ye\u2019s expression.After that, they and the rest did not say a word. They did not even mock, as this was something that they had taken for granted. No one had put the \u201cbold words\u201d that Zhang Ye had said yesterday to heart. The fairy tales these days had already been regurgitated so much that they were all bland. There were only those few stories. Ignoring the children, even as adults, they could narrate it backwards. You wanted to stir up \u201cOld and Young Story Club\u201d in such an environment? They only laughed.After the results were announced, everyone began working.Zhang Ye had reserved Recording Studio #4 at ten. He was about to go.Teacher Feng called out to him from behind. After hesitating for a while, he said, \u201cForget it, Little Zhang. This might be your last program. Just do your best and do not have any regrets.\u201dZhang Ye did not respond, as he silently entered the recording studio.Forget it? Impossible! His dictionary did not have the two words \u201cforget it\u201d! Even if the whole world did not acknowledge him, even if everyone thought that he couldn\u2019t make it, Zhang Ye would use his beliefs and principles and use his greatest abilities to do things to his best!He began recording!Zhang Ye was very professional. Although he was emotional, the moment he switched on his headset, he changed to an attitude that he should have. He warmly smiled, \u201cHello, children. Welcome to today\u2019s \u2018Old and Young Story Club\u2019. I\u2019m wondering if everyone found yesterday\u2019s story, \u2018Snow White\u2019, interesting. Or maybe if it has made you think about what sort of person you would want to be like when you grow up. Today, I\u2019ll bring out another story for everyone.\u201d\u201cOld and Young Story Club\u201d was similar to the \u201cLate-night Ghost Stories\u201d of the past. It did not have any advertisement sponsorship. Its listenership ratings were too low, hence he did not need to record advertisements like he did for the final tens of episodes of \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019 at the beginning. He could immediately narrate his story.\u201cMany years ago, there was an emperor. He spent all his money that so he could dress nicely. He did not care about his army, nor did he like to go to the theater. He also did not like to tour the parks in his coach, unless it was to show off his brand-new clothes. Every day, at one o\u2019clock, he would change into a new set of clothes. When people mentioned him, they would always say, \u2018The emperor is in the changing room.'\u201dSomeone must have guessed it!Yes, this is the famous story from Zhang Ye\u2019s world. It was the famous fairy tale that had even appeared in many textbooks, \u201cNews Broadcast\u201d!Alright, let\u2019s not make this joke in the future. Definitely not again!Yes, the fairy tale\u2019s name is News\u2026 It\u2019s called \u201cThe Emperor\u2019s New Clothes\u201d!\u201c\u2018He\u2019s actually not wearing any clothes!\u2019 all the citizens finally said. The emperor felt a slight quiver. This was because he felt that what the citizens said appeared to be true. However, he was still thinking, \u2018I need to finish this parade.\u2019 As such, he put on a proud air. His officials followed behind him, holding onto a gown that did not exist.\u201d The story finished.\u2026Coming out of the recording studio into the bathroom.Teacher Feng was still smoking worriedly in the bathroom, \u201cYou are done recording?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s done.\u201d Zhang Ye went to relieve himself.However, the moment that he approached, the surrounding colleagues from the Literature Channel dispersed. Tian Bin was still by the urinal. He had dodged far away before he had even zipped up his pants. Only then did he pull up his zipper and take a long path around Zhang Ye, before exiting the bathroom. The others did the same.The bathroom was empty almost immediately!Teacher Feng smiled, \u201cLook at your popularity.\u201dZhang Ye felt innocent, \u201cAm I that scary?\u201d\u201cWhat say you? Were the events in the office not spooky enough? I know it was a coincidence, but it was too great a coincidence. It happened once, thrice and five times. How can people not speak about it after seeing it? Hehe, it is only that both of us have good relations, or else would anyone who wants to offend you have to think twice before doing anything?\u201d After joking, Teacher Feng said after noticing that the surroundings were empty, \u201cI know that you have done your best. Don\u2019t worry about the segment. I was already mentally prepared. I also know that this segment won\u2019t last any longer. Jia Yan is the Station Leader\u2019s relative. If he wants to go on a program, no one can stop him!\u201dZhang Ye\u2019s attitude was very clear, \u201cTeacher Feng, I feel that nothing is impossible. This reason or that explanation are all excuses. I don\u2019t believe I can\u2019t treat them! I don\u2019t believe our segment\u2019s ratings will not be able to be pulled up in this life! \u2018Late-night Ghost Stories\u2019 was pulled up by me. Previously, what did people say of that segment? They said it was impossible. Its performance was even worse than \u2018Old and Young Story Club\u2019. But now, what has happened? I had managed to bring it up with my efforts! I could pull the segment with the worst ratings to the top three. Now, I can also pull \u2018Old and Young Story Club\u2019 into the top three!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The facts have proven that I was not wrong. Your ability has been acknowledged by everyone. You have also gained the recognition of the listeners. However, humans are not lone individuals in this society. You need to eat, you need to survive, you need to cater to others, you need to be tactful. The station had planned the case regarding \u201cGhost Blows Out the Light\u201d for a very long time. It had even established a special small planning team for it. Just because of one simple word from you of not selling, all the plans the station\u2019s management had gone up into smoke. How could the station not be angry about this? Me suppressing you a bit this time was beyond my control. Do you understand what I mean?\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201d Zhang Ye said with a deadpan expression.\u201cThat\u2019s good, then about the copyright\u2026\u201d Zhao Guozhou persuaded.Zhang Ye said without hesitation, \u201cNot selling.\u201dZhao Guozhou turned mad again, \u201cYou really can\u2019t give me peace of mind!\u201dZhang Ye also said his heartfelt feelings, \u201cDirector Zhao, I know you greatly appreciated me. Back then it was you who took me in despite my looks. For this favor, I\u2019ll remember you for life. I know the station is repressing me, so it\u2019s fine no matter how you treat me. However, about the copyright, I will say that same line forever \u2013 not selling!\u201d\u201cYou are willing to not go on a segment in the future?\u201d Zhao Guozhou asked as he worried over his talent.Zhang Ye said, \u201cI still have a segment now. I will pull it up!\u201dZhao Guozhou knocked on the form on his table, \u201cThe afternoon listenership rates have been handed out. Although it will only be announced tomorrow, I shall take this opportunity to tell you that \u2018Old and Young Story Club\u2019 is still in last place. This segment cannot be pulled up. It\u2019s useless, no matter who it is. Your talent should be placed on a bigger stage, but why are you so stubborn? You\u2026Hai, forget it. Go back.\u201dLining the bottom once again?Really can\u2019t be pulled up?Zhang Ye refused to believe that it was so. If two episodes weren\u2019t enough, he would record a third. If the third recording wasn\u2019t enough, he would record a fourth. He still had three days\u2019 time. It was still possible for him to turn the situation around!\u2026The sky still was bright, even after he returned home.The rental apartment was quiet and lonely. It was like his current situation.Zhang Ye switched on the computer as he absent-mindedly read the news. After some analysis, he realized that the reason why the ratings had not been pulled up was not the fault of the story. How could \u201cSnow White\u201d and \u201cThe Emperor\u2019s New Clothes\u201d have a problem? They were the classic fairy tales out of the classics fairy tales from his world. The reason was apparently due to inertia. There were not that many people listening to this segment. New listeners were already completely disappointed with the present fairy tales, or they were sick of them. There was no habit to even listen in. There would not be any fresh blood being injected, so it would be odd if the listenership rate\u00a0was going up!How was he to attract new listeners?He felt that he needed an opportunity; otherwise, it would be very difficult!Zhang Ye left his mouse as he switched on television, planning to watch the News Channel. As someone working in the media industry, watching the news was part and parcel of one\u2019s daily work.\u201cToday, another heinous case of a missing child happened in the capital. In a small district near to Cheng Nan Jia Yuan, four-year-old Wen Wen was left alone at home with his parents at work. According to police investigations and analysis of closed-circuit TV footage, Wen Wen had opened the door to a male stranger around the age of 35. It is unknown what method this person used to gain Wen Wen\u2019s trust. Not only did he bring away Wen Wen, he had taken several valuables in the house. According to the closed-circuit TV footage, Wen Wen apparently was not crying. Currently, the police are using all their efforts to take in criminal suspects. This is the picture of the suspect taken from the closed-circuit TV. If anyone sees this suspect, please immediately contact the number shown on your screen!\u201d The Central TV\u2019s News Channel\u2019s female anchorwoman said solemnly with a tinge of anger.Next were street and school interviews.A woman holding a vegetable basket said to the reporter, \u201cThis is already the fourth time a child has been abducted from home this month, right? It\u2019s so depraved! These people should be shot to death!\u201dAn old man said, \u201cWhy do these sort of things keep happening? Why would a child open the door to a stranger? I think it\u2019s a problem with our education!\u201dAt a particular kindergarten, the reporter interviewed at a promotional event held in the school. There were many people gathered in the school field. There were teachers, older students and parents.\u201cLittle friends, remember that when you are alone at home, you must never open the door to strangers. Did you hear that?\u201d\u201cHeard that!\u201d\u201cCan you remember?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThe screen switched back to the studio. The female anchor said, \u201cActually, the instructions of never to open the door to a stranger has been repeated countless numbers of times in the children education system. All the children know this, but when they meet strangers who claim to be \u201cMommy\u2019s\u201d or \u201cDaddy\u2019s\u201d colleague, they still open the door. This is the fourth time that it has happened this month. I do not know what has gone wrong in our education system.\u201dMaybe we should use a teaching method more suitable for children to tell them this. It should not be something repeated to them in a dogmatic manner. Children have their children\u2019s way of thinking and their own world. The way we indoctrinate them with ideas might not be something they can understand. Hence, a week ago, Beijing\u2019s Education Ministry has led the way by organizing the historically largest fairy tale essay competition event. The name is \u201cFairy Tale Essays Collection for Not Opening the Door to Strangers\u201d, The goal is to use these fairy tales to caution children in a fun and educative manner, so as to let children genuinely realize how to protect themselves.\u201dFairy Tale Essays Collection?Zhang Ye immediately had a feeling. Here came an opportunity!But the next thing the female anchor said made him disappointed, \u201cSubmissions began last week and the deadline is at midnight, tonight. During this period, the education ministry has allowed people to vote as a fair way to choose the number one story. From that, kindergarten and elementary schools or other child care groups will receive large-scale promotions!\u201dIt was already 7+ P.M.!There was less than five hours left?Zhang Ye switched off the television and hurriedly opened the Beijing\u2019s Education Ministry\u2019s specially created essay website. There were many publicity pictures on it. They were filled with pictures of children that had gone missing in Beijing. Their smiling faces, their pictures of their lives and the crying expressions of the parents whose children had gone missing. There was only one slogan: Please use your words to help children. Upon seeing this, Zhang Ye\u2019s heart felt heavy, as if he felt suffocated. He was planning to look for an opportunity to improve the segment\u2019s ratings. But upon seeing that the deadline was at midnight, Zhang Ye knew that it was impossible. Others had accumulated a full week of votes, so how could he exceed them within just a few hours? However, when he followed the stories of how children were abducted, Zhang Ye felt that he had to write something. It had nothing to do with his segment, nor did it have to do with anything else. He just wanted to contribute a portion of his strength!So what if he did not succeed?It was enough, as long as he did something!\u2026As this matter caused quite a commotion in society, people on the streets, in public transport, on the internet and those interacting with online media were all reflecting and discussing about it. It could be considered a hot topic among all the citizens. Anything that was child-related would forever be something that grabbed the hearts of people. Hence, this continuous outbreak of heinous crimes had caused great concern for society. As such, this fairy tale essay competition had become abnormally well-received. Many people published their stories.The most famous one was by Tao Xueru, the highest-paid female children\u2019s fairy tale author in the country.Secondly, there was Little Red Mushroom. It was a stage name. She, too, was a female children\u2019s fairy tale author. The sales of her books were inferior to Tao Xueru, but the most famous fairy tale in the country was hers.The both of them were practically propping up about half of the children\u2019s fairy tale industry in the country.There were other children\u2019s literature authors. Many authors of fairy tales that people were familiar with when they were young had submitted their stories to the essay competition.The ranking was as follows.Little Red Mushroom: 28,018 votes.Tao Xueru: 24,311 votes.Old Lee: 17,223 votes.Zhang Qiang: 16,976 votes.For the story competition, the authors who submitted their works would show their verified status. For example, Little Red Mushroom and company all had their verified status. Zhang Qiang, who was ranked at fourth place, was a children\u2019s literature author. Only Old Lee, who was in third place, was not in the industry. In his verification status, there was written \u201cOffice Employee\u201d.Zhang Ye flipped through the stories. Ever since the world changed into a different world, Zhang Ye always had a feeling of looking down upon others. However, when he looked at the top ranking stories, he was quite impressed. They were worthy of being the top figures in the field of children\u2019s literature. They were well written, especially Little Red Mushroom\u2019s children story that was ranked first. Even if it was brought to Zhang Ye\u2019s world, it was a high-quality fairy tale that could be remade into an animation.However, it was still lacking slightly. It was not that the story was poor, but it was because the story was slightly complex. After all, the target audience of a fairy tale to warn children not to open a door to a stranger was definitely very young. One could not expect them to understand things that were too complicated. Little Red Mushroom\u2019s story was 8,000 thousand words long. So although it was really good, there were too many characters. Zhang Ye suspected that children would not be able to finish reading it properly.The further he went down the ranks, the more horrible the stories became.Ignoring those who were not professional authors, some of those with verification statuses were children\u2019s literature authors. How could they write such a mess? These stories all had a serious problem. Either they were so childish that even children themselves would find it childish, or they were too mature, where the entire story was written according to an adult\u2019s way of thinking. How could these be shown to children?None of them could work!All of the stories were inappropriate!Zhang Ye pulled up his sleeves and got to work. He felt that he had a story that was extremely appropriate. It was also a story gathered out of the overall essence from his world. It would be perfect if used in this essay competition. There was no other story that was better than that one.Zhang Ye first used his Weibo\u2019s information to gain the recognition on the education website. After obtaining his verification, Zhang Ye began typing. He clacked away before uploading it!The story\u2019s name: \u201cLittle Bunnies Be Good\u201d.Mommy Bunny had three children. One was called Little Red Eyes, one was called Long Ears, and one was called Stumpy Tail.One day, Mommy Bunny said to her children, \u201cMommy is going to the fields to pick carrots. Watch the house and close the door. Don\u2019t open the door to anyone; open the door only when Mommy comes.\u201dMommy Bunny carried her basket and walked towards the fields. The Little Bunnies remembered Mommy\u2019s words and locked the door well.Later on, the Big Bad Wolf came. He wanted to enter the Little Bunnies\u2019 house, but the door was tightly closed by the Little Bunnies, so he could not enter!The Big Bad Wolf sat by the Little Bunnies\u2019 door. He narrowed his eyes and thought of a bad idea. Suddenly, he saw Mommy Bunny return. He quickly ran and hid behind a large tree.Mommy Bunny came to the door. She pushed the door but the door was tightly closed. As she knocked, she sang, \u201cLittle Bunnies be good; open the door! Come, open it quickly; I want to come in.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The Little Bunnies locked up the door and waited for their mommy to return. After a while, the Big Bad Wolf came again. He knocked at the door while holding his nose, \u201cLittle Bunnies be good, open the door. Come open quickly; I want to come in.\u201d\u201cNo, no! That\u2019s not Mommy\u2019s voice.\u201d\u201cNo, no! It\u2019s not Mommy; it\u2019s the Big Bad Wolf!\u201d\u201cNot opening, not opening. We\u2019re not opening. Mommy hasn\u2019t returned yet. We won\u2019t open it for anyone!\u201dThe fairy tale was simple, but to the point. The Big Bad Wolf mimicked Mommy Bunny\u2019s song to trick the Little Bunnies. Little Red Eyes and Stumpy Tail were tricked and wanted to open the door, but Long Ears knew better. So it peeked through the cracks in the door and saw that it was not Mommy Bunny. They tricked the Big Bad Wolf into putting his tail in through the doorway and slammed the door shut. The Big Bad Wolf was trapped and when Mommy Bunny came home, she chased the Big Bad Wolf back to the mountains, with his broken tail between his feet.A message simplified.Something so simple, but yet the message was clear.After posting, Zhang Ye didn\u2019t give it further thought. He went to the bathroom and had a warm shower. After drying up and blow-drying his hair, he went off to the landlady\u2019s place. He pressed the bell many times, but no one opened the door. Rao Aimin must not be around. Giving it some thought, Zhang Ye finally took out his wallet and counted last month\u2019s rent and supply\u00a0debts, together with this month\u2019s rent, before slipping it underneath the doorway. He followed up with a note to explain.At this moment, the opposite door opened and a couple came out of their rented home.\u201cWhat shall we eat?\u201d\u201cAnything\u2019s fine. Oh, I just read a fairy tale and found it to be really good.\u201d\u201cThe ones from the Education Ministry\u2019s essay competition to the children?\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s called \u201cLittle Bunnies Be Good\u201d. It\u2019s so well-written, even though it\u2019s just a paragraph of words to tell children not to open doors to strangers. The words seem rubbish at first glance, but in fact none of the words in there can be considered rubbish; it\u2019s even interesting. Too bad there is no music to accompany the song portion. I\u2019m really looking forward to seeing how the song should be sung.\u201d\u201cIs it that good?\u201d\u201cYou would know if you read it. The story has only been posted for less than an hour. There\u2019s already a few thousand votes for it, and it is doing better than most submissions that were sent in a week ago.\u201d\u201cSo ruthless? Which Teacher wrote it?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. I did not pay attention to that.\u201dThe person relating it had less interest than the listener. Zhang Ye gazed at the two of them walking further and further away. He rushed back to his room and quickly went online to check his ranking!9th place!\u201cLittle Bunnies Be Good\u201d Total votes: 7,861 votes!The discussion and comments below were also explosive!#1: Which master\u2019s work of art is this? The story is too awesome!#2: Zhang Ye? I have never heard of him. Master, don\u2019t put on an act anymore. You must be a fairy tale author. Please tell us your true identity. You can\u2019t bluff me!#3: Such depth!#75: It\u2019s almost reaching 8,000 votes. How long has it been up?#80: Who is Zhang Ye? Those must be manipulated votes, right?#81: You still ask who he is? Isn\u2019t there a verification behind his name?#82: Verification details cannot be believed. A ghost story writer coming to write a fairy tale? And he wrote so well?#90: As a kindergarten teacher, I find this story to be absolutely perfect! I have already recommended it to my colleagues. I have also posted it on Weibo for my students\u2019 parents. Everyone, help vote for \u201cLittle Bunnies Be Good\u201d. Help promote it. This is first place in my heart!#99: I read this story to my child, and he really liked it. And he actually\u00a0understood it. He kept saying how he would never open the door for the Big Bad Wolf! I\u2019m so thankful to Teacher Zhang Ye. With so many abducting incidents happening this month, as a couple, we were very worried. We kept instilling in our child that he should not open the door to strangers, but he could not understand. But now after listening to this story, without us needing to say much, the child himself has understood. In the past, I really did not believe in fairy tales or so-called children\u2019s literature. I was thinking, \u2018What about them? Could children really understand that?\u2019 At most, it would be a joy reading it. But today, I understood that it is not that children\u2019s literature is unreliable, it is that our country lacks good stories! I have already activated several parents to help vote. We must keep voting for it to the end!#130: Can it not be so dramatic!? Why are there so many votes? Haha, however, one of those votes is mine. There\u2019s nothing else to say about the story. It\u2019s absolutely great!Zhang Ye watched with his own eyes as the votes soared. He, too, was shocked. He had not expected much from this essay competition, as he could not compare to people who had been canvassing for votes for a week. He never expected that everyone gave it its due recognition!10:30 P.M. The votes had reached 10,000!11 P.M. The votes had already exceeded 20,000!At 11:30 P.M., \u201cLittle Bunnies Be Good\u201d had already climbed to second place. It was only losing to first place, Teacher Little Red Mushroom\u2019s story, by a few hundred votes!Having been uploaded for four hours! Votes reaching 29,000 votes!This was almost a miracle! Many people turned silly seeing this!As the saying goes, \u201cproblems happen to people when they turn famous; the bird which takes the lead gets shot.\u201d For a layperson like Zhang Ye to catch up with the top masters in the field, especially in a sure-kill momentum all the way up, there were naturally people who couldn\u2019t stand watching this. Fans of Little Red Mushroom immediately came attacking!The comments section on \u201cLittle Bunnies Be Good\u201d had exploded!\u201cDefinitely manipulated votes!\u201d\u201cDo you even have a heart? To manipulate like this?\u201d\u201cHow can you have more votes than Teacher Tao Xueru!?\u201d\u201cSummoning! All fans of Teacher Little Red Mushroom, take notice! Regardless if they are manipulating votes, we must help Teacher Little Red Mushroom to push hers to the top. Every IP is limited to one vote, but I can teach you a simple way. Disconnect and connect again. Typically, your internet connection will change its IP. If that doesn\u2019t work, clear your cookies, then carry on voting. Everyone, let\u2019s go!\u201d\u201cRight! Come and help!\u201d\u201cWe cannot let Teacher Little Red Mushroom get suppressed!\u201d\u201cWe must get first place! Regardless of who stands in our way!\u201d\u201cHaha, aren\u2019t we a bit of a bully? He is a newcomer and must not have seen the power of such a huge fanclub. He\u2019s probably scared by now!\u201d\u201cThe point is to scare him to death!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right; we must let him know who is the boss in the industry!\u201d\u201cAh, Teacher Little Red Mushroom has posted on Weibo, asking everyone to vote for her!\u201d\u201cSupporting Teacher Mushroom. How dare a layperson be this arrogant? Let\u2019s tell him why flowers are so red!* However, do it with mercy; don\u2019t scare a newcomer!\u201dThe moment Little Red Mushroom made the call to arms, her massive fanbase gathered together. Initially, they were leading by a few hundred votes. But in just ten minutes, they had pulled away from Zhang Ye by more than 5000 votes!Her fans had even gone into Zhang Ye\u2019s story commenting section to ridicule.\u201cOho, you are going down now, right?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll let you try to catch up. Looking down on our Mushroom fanclub?\u201d\u201cEveryone show some mercy. I\u2019m guessing that this newcomer Zhang Ye is already dazed from fright. Haha!\u201dMany onlookers could not stand watching this any further. What sort of people were the Mushroom fanclub? How could they be so insolent? \u201cLittle Bunnies Be Good\u201d was in itself a very good story; how could you claim that they had manipulated votes? And the bunch of you ended up manipulating votes? And even trampled on him!? Laughing at how he was a newcomer without any fans!? This made many uncomfortable. So what if he was a newcomer? So what if he did not have fans? Who made the rule that newcomers could not write good stories? The onlooking parents and kindergarten teachers wanted to help Zhang Ye, but their strength was limited. They could only give him another 1,000 votes.There was another ten minutes before the polls closed!There was only ten minutes left to midnight!At this moment, everyone knew that Zhang Ye had no hopes of being first. He was forcefully suppressed by the local pecking order. Zhang Ye felt the same way, too!However, there were always surprises that lay in wait!A miracle that no one had expected happened!\u2026On Weibo, a post appeared out of nowhere!ZhangYeNumber1Fan howled, \u201cAre there any brothers who have not slept? Quickly come out! Urgent! Urgent! Teacher Zhang Ye has posted a children\u2019s fairy tale on the \u201cFairytale Essays Collection for Not Opening the Door to Strangers\u201d! It\u2019s a new piece of work! It was about to get first place! But it was suppressed by Little Red Mushroom\u2019s fanclub! They even cursed by saying Teacher Zhang Ye is a newcomer and doesn\u2019t have the power of fans. They even flooded the screen with mocking words. Let me show you a screenshot!\u201dHe immediately uploaded a screenshot, which included the mockery and ridicule the Mushroom fanclub had posted. Some morally bankrupt fans even cursed at Zhang Ye using vulgarities for no apparent reason!\u201cHoly shit!\u201d\u201cImmediate anger!\u201d\u201cSomething has happened again?\u201d\u201cThey dare to scold Teacher Zhang Ye? Haha! Expecting a tragedy from them!\u201d\u201cThey sure are overly bold. Really too bold. They clearly do not know what the result of scolding Great God Zhang is. I\u2019m really worried about their intellect!\u201d\u201cI can only admire their courage!\u201d\u201cRight, anyone who knows about the war of words would never dare to blatantly curse at Teacher Zhang Ye. This is purely the prelude to courting death!\u201dThose members of the troll army who had participated or watched in that day\u2019s war of words forwarded the Weibo post!ZhangYeNumber1Fan\u2019s growled angrily, \u201cCan you bear it anymore? I can\u2019t! F**k! Who told them that Teacher Zhang Ye doesn\u2019t have a fanclub? Who told them that Teacher Zhang Ye is a newcomer? I\u2019ll blind their dog eyes! To think they didn\u2019t find out about Great God Zhang\u2019s awesomeness! Comrades! The time when we are needed has come! We cannot let Teacher Zhang fight alone! All those brothers who had participated in the war of words, gather! Those who had previously fought with Teacher Zhang Ye in arms, gather! All of us, go vote for Teacher Zhang Ye! Let that Mushroom fanclub know the power of our troll army! Let\u2019s see who will let who know how the f**k the flowers are this red!\u201d I have\u00a0\u201c@\u201d a bunch of people below!\u2026At almost the same moment, the appearance of the troll army had flooded into the comment section of \u201cLittle Bunnies Be Good\u201d!\u201cI\u2019m here!\u201d\u201cResponding to the call, vote has been cast!\u201d\u201cI bought a watch last year! F**k the Mushroom fanclub to death!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t read children\u2019s fairy tales, but I unconditionally support Great God Zhang!\u201d\u201cDitto!\u201d\u201cDitto+110!\u201d\u201cDitto+119!\u201d\u201cTeacher Zhang Ye, we are here!\u201d\u201cWhen trouble occurs at one spot, help comes from all quarters!\u201d\u201cFollowing Teacher Zhang Ye gives you meat to eat and girls to meet!\u201d\u201cToday, Teacher Zhang is too refined.

When have we been afraid!?\u201d\u201cTo be able to fight alongside Great God Zhang Ye! I feel my warm blood boiling! My large saber can no longer endure the thirst! Brothers, attack!\u201dZhang Ye\u2019s fans began their war cries, as if they were on stimulants!1,000 votes!5,000 votes!10,000 votes!In just ten minutes!To be accurate, it was in just nine and a half minutes!\u201cLittle Bunnies Be Good\u201d had suddenly jumped to take the number one spot in the essay competition! 45,000+ votes! It far exceeded second place\u2019s Little Red Mushroom by nearly 10,000 votes!In this miraculous instant, everyone turned silent. They were dumbfounded from the shock!The 1,000+ people from the Mushroom fanclub gasped. They could not believe their own eyes! What was the matter? What had happened? Your granduncle! Where did these people suddenly jump out from!?The onlooking neutral crowd also became overjoyed. They then realized that Teacher Zhang Ye, who had been scolded for being a newcomer by the Mushroom fanclub all day, was no newcomer. He, too, had his fanclub\u2026 and the numbers were more than the Mushroom fanclub\u2019s by a few dozen times!This smacking of the face was too ruthless!The Mushroom fanclub fell silent. Teacher Little Red Mushroom also did not speak a single word!This was because, at this moment, a large question mark had simultaneously appeared in their minds. Your sister! Who is this Zhang Ye? How does he have such powerful charisma!?Chapter 41: Zhang Ye\u2019s Troll Fan Army!*This is a common slang phrase in China,\u00a0it was originally a lyric from a song, to represent the passion for revolution. it was later used in other situations. Commonly used when exchanging words in a violent scene. The general idea behind it is that the person would spill so much blood the flowers would soak it up and they would turn red.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Zhang Ye\u2019s story got first place.Needless to say, members of the Mushroom fanclub and onlookers were shocked. Other long-time authors of fairy tales were dumbfounded. Even Zhang Ye did not immediately come to believe it. He only had one thought; that it was impossible. When did this bro gain so many die hard fans?He knew his own worth. Indeed, he had written a few poems and created a supernatural novel. But he was not that great; he still had some ways to go. Compared to\u00a0Andy Lau\u2018s works, if anyone saw them, their first reaction would be, \u201c\u2018Oh, this is a\u00a0Heavenly King\u2018s movie\u201d, \u201cOh, this is an Andy Lau song\u201d. There were also works produced by others which were very famous, too. However, if you were to ask who the author was, a lot of them would not remember. Zhang Ye was in a similar situation. Even when many people had seen those works of his, they would only remember the title of the work. Only a small number of people knew his name as the author!Then how did this huge fan support come about?With the blink of an eye, they had annihilated the Mushroom fanclub who had declared war? And it was destroying them to the point of them being unable to respond?This essay competition was their cultural domain! That was the fanclub of one of the top children\u2019s fairy tale authors! However, why did it now seem that this battle was in Zhang Ye\u2019s territory instead?This should not be, there must be a reason!Looking at the comments\u2026\u2026Checking Weibo\u2026\u2026Soon, Zhang Ye found the reason. The majority of the voters could not be considered his fans; at least 80% were not. Most of them had not even heard of \u201cGhost Blows Out the Light\u201d, nor read Zhang Ye\u2019s poems. The common point was that they had participated in or witnessed the \u201cCurseGate\u201d scandal from a few days ago. Still, there were some of Zhang Ye\u2019s hardcore fans among them; for example, the one who gathered all the support, \u201cZhangYeNumber1Fan\u201d. The others were internet trolls who participated because they had nothing else to do. When there was some excitement gathered over here, all of them had quickly gathered around to mess things up. These were people who were not afraid of anything, as they were bored out of their wits. Coupled with the fact that \u201cCurseGate\u201d was only a few days ago and Zhang Ye had an astounding victory then, the internet trolls were in awe. Therefore, many of them had crazily voted after being alerted by some of Zhang Ye\u2019s hardcore fans. It was similar to his world\u2019s \u201cHelping Wang Feng hit the headlines\u201d*, creating issues for the sake of creating it!After achieving victory, the trolls went about boasting of their victory!\u201cFirst place!\u201d\u201cGood one, bros!\u201d\u201cHaha! Everyone was f**king awesome!\u201d\u201c10,000 votes, 10,000! Can we not be so crazy!?\u201d\u201cWhere\u2019s the people from Mushroom fanclub? Where? Weren\u2019t you clamoring to scare us? Why does it look like all of you are scared instead?\u201d\u201cKnow how many fans Great God Zhang has now? Dare to look down on us?\u201d\u201cYou should be well aware, Mushroom fanclub, that you are too naive!\u201d\u201cClaiming that Teacher Zhang Ye manipulated the votes? Yet you people kept on manipulating? That\u2019s funny! Does Teacher Zhang Ye even need to manipulate? Do we need to manipulate? We just voted once each! We do not need to manipulate any votes to destroy you! With our friends, we share good meat and wine, towards our enemies, we will take them on anytime and are never careless! \u00a0Today, we will gift every one of you the famous phrase of Teacher Zhang Ye \u2014 I bought a watch last year!\u201d\u201cThis is a memorable battle! Let us record down this historic moment! Let\u2019s follow Teacher Zhang Ye again to create another miracle!\u201d\u201cSo fun! So exciting!\u201d\u201cIs Teacher Zhang Ye still around?\u201d\u201cWe have captured the enemy\u2019s walls. We have sounded the trumpets of victory. Teacher Zhang, please say a few words to us bros!\u201dZhang Ye did not know whether to laugh or to cry. He did not expect that so many people would come and help him. In his heart, he was also very touched. He immediately left a message on the \u201cLittle Bunnies Be Good\u201d comments section. Everyone had been so supportive towards him, so he had to leave a message, \u201cThank you everyone for your help. My comrades, you have worked hard!\u201dThe replies were very orderly!\u201cTo serve the people!\u201d\u201cTo serve the people +1!\u201d\u201cTo serve the people +723!\u201dA thread that had over 800 replies, all of which were the same!What was this battle formation? What was this momentum? A lot of neutrals watching felt their adrenaline rushing. A troll army like that was enough to rule the world\u2026.. *Cough* Except that this army was too not up to par. At the end of it all, the onlookers still had no idea who Zhang Ye was; how did he have such a large troll army helping out?ZhangYeNumber1Fan dispersed the crowds, \u201cMission accomplished! Troll army pull back! Thank you for the help, bros!\u201dThey gathered quickly, and they also dispersed quickly. This group of trolls were like a nest of wasps, attacking whoever they disliked. They came and went as they wished!Seeing the dispersal of the troll army, the Mushroom fanclub members reappeared. They went to the website\u2019s report section to complain about Zhang Ye\u2019s fairy tale.Mushroom Gang Warrior: \u201cReported! \u201cLittle Bunnies Be Good\u201d vote manipulation!\u201dMushroom Gang 77: \u201cMore than forty thousands votes in four hours! Impossible! The manipulation is too obvious!\u201dQWYUE33: \u201cIn my opinion, it looks manipulated, too. The others only had tens of thousands of votes in seven days. Furthermore, they were professional authors. He\u2019s only a radio host who writes ghost stories. How could he have written such a good fairy tale? And to have so many people vote for him? It\u2019s not realistic!\u201dSuddenly, Little Red Mushroom\u2019s account message also appeared in the reporting section. She had taken it upon herself, obviously unhappy with the result of second place. Because this essay competition only had one winner; second and third place did not matter. There would be no prize money, nor any trophies. Only the first placed essay would be selected by the Beijing Education Ministry to be promoted to kindergartens and primary schools; second place would receive nothing!Little Red Mushroom posted \u201cDid anyone check the authenticity of the votes? I believe many of the authors in the professional circle will not accept this result. The votes for \u201cLittle Bunnies Be Good\u201d seem to be abnormal!\u201dOnce the top author of children\u2019s books spoke, several professional authors who took part in the essay competition followed up with their replies regarding Zhang Ye\u2019s votes\u2019 authenticity!\u201cDid the technical team go off duty?\u201d\u201cSuch obvious vote manipulation, yet nobody realizes it?\u201d\u201cAre there still fair rules and a transparent system?\u201dA website staff member replied, \u201cThe technical team is handling the complaint. Please wait; if there are manipulated votes, they will be invalidated!\u201dAfter about 10 minutes, the results were out!Essay Competition 1st Place: \u201cLittle Bunnies Be Good\u201d.Author: Zhang Ye.Total Votes: 45,871!Zhang Ye\u2019s total votes remain unchanged; it was exactly the same as when voting closed. Rather, it was second place Little Red Mushroom\u2019s story whose votes dropped from 37,212 to 35,399! Around 2,000 votes were invalidated!After the results were released, there was silence!There really was no fake votes! This story really defied logic! It really managed to gain more than 40,000 votes in four hours?Everyone was surprised, but no one questioned the authenticity of Zhang Ye\u2019s votes. Even without the troll army\u2019s support near the end, subtracting the votes manipulated by Little Red Mushroom\u2019s fans, Zhang Ye would have still obtained first place. There were no qualms about that!Of course, one could not say that, as well. If the troll army did not push Zhang Ye to the top and, as second place, Zhang Ye\u2019s report of Little Red Mushroom manipulating votes might not even be heeded by the website.The cute troll army had given Zhang Ye a huge favor!Zhang Ye was moved for a while, before he suddenly recalled what really mattered. He immediately added another sentence to his story\u2019s introduction, \u201cThis version of the story is a\u00a0silent\u00a0text edition. It is not the full \u2018Little Bunnies Be Good\u2019 version. Tomorrow, at noon on Beijing Radio Station\u2019s Literature Channel\u2019s \u2018Old and Young Story Club\u2019, the complete audio version will be promptly broadcast for everyone. The song in the story will be presented to everyone then; please listen to it.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s really a song? I thought it was just text!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve remembered the time. I will definitely listen to it punctually!\u201d\u201cHaha. I was waiting for the song. I will tell my colleagues, too.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m still feeling pissed. Some people just don\u2019t like to see people in a better off state? If you are inferior to others, you are inferior to others. To claim others were manipulating votes? Who set the rule that only professionals can write a good story? Who set the rule that a ghost story\u2019s author cannot write a good children\u2019s fairy tale? I suggest that those so-called Teachers who had reported Teacher Zhang Ye should look at \u201cLittle Bunnies Be Good\u201d with a patient and learning attitude. Don\u2019t use the perspective and moral of looking at a stranger\u2019s work. Teacher Zhang\u2019s fairy tale completely beat all of you. He deserves it fully! My child is now beside me, pestering me to memorize \u201cLittle Bunnies Be Good\u201d and narrate it to her daily! The children have already given their answer!\u201d\u201cThe previous poster said it well!\u201d\u201cHai, whenever a newcomer makes new waves, his legitimacy will always be questioned!\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t watch this any further. It was already quite irritating when the Mushroom fan club first started screaming and declaring war. Were they thinking of using their numbers to bully others? Ha! In the end, their faces got smacked terribly! Zhang Ye? This Teacher is interesting. I have already fan-ed his Weibo. I really like his fairy tale.\u201d\u201cHandshake!\u201d\u201cI like Zhang Ye\u2019s story! Passer-by transforming into a fan!\u201dZhang Ye\u2019s popularity had a small amount of growth. Even more people got to know his story and him as a person through this incident!*Wang Feng\u00a0\u2013 a celebrity whose news was\u00a0often overshadowed by other celebrities\u2019 news that happened at the same time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Zhang Ye was not in a hurry to take the subway to work. He stopped by a kiosk for some time as he browsed through the morning\u2019s papers. He wanted to see if \u201cLittle Bunnies Be Good\u201d would be reported.Beijing Times? None!Beijing Morning Post? None!Other tabloids in the capital? Also none!Zhang Ye was depressed. Could it be because the polls ended too late yesterday? These newspapers probably had to begin printing at 4 A.M., so they could not publish it in time? That would be bad.He was planning to use this to pull up his listenership rates. Without any promotion, how was he going to pull it up?Hai, I\u2019ll leave it in God\u2019s hands.What could be done had been done by Zhang Ye. He had put in his best efforts. Today, he needed to see if the listenership rates would still be at the bottom for \u201cOld and Young Story Club\u201d. Just rising up a bit to the 19th or 20th spot would be good; at least, it wouldn\u2019t be so embarrassing. Only then could Zhang Ye carry on thinking of a method to pull the segment up. There was not much time left.This time, Zhang Ye was really placing all his hopes and bets on the Education Ministry\u2019s official Essay Competition event. \u201cOld and Young Story Club\u201d depended on this bet to be revived!Zhang Ye\u2019s goal now was very simple and that was to use his fastest speed to do the segment on his hands well. By obtaining the best newcomer broadcasting host award in the shortest time possible, especially one that was quite authoritative, then he could say goodbye to this screwed up unit. This place was just a springboard for Zhang Ye. It was a pit stop before he went to an even higher stage. After obtaining the experience and qualifications, Zhang Ye would be like a free bird. Just using a niche late-night program like \u201cGhost Blows Out the Light\u201d was insufficient for buffing up his resume!From today onwards, he wanted to develop towards being a television host. That was a place that required good looks. Their looks and height requirements were many times higher than a radio station\u2019s for a broadcasting host. How was he to convince the Leaders, Directors or Program Producers to ignore his appearance, so as to get them to hire him? He was a newcomer with average looks and height, and he did not have any background or connections.Women could rely on makeup if they did not have a pretty face. Without makeup, they could use their bodyline!What about men? What could men with poor looks rely on? There were only three things that they could rely on.First: Fake it to make it!Second: Being good at faking it to make it!Third: Must be able to be good at faking it to make it!Alright, let\u2019s be serious. Actually, for a person like him who was lacking, he needed ability and records of service!Zhang Ye was currently not lacking in ability. The only thing he lacked was his record of service. He had to cause a segment\u2019s listenership to explode, so as to establish his foundation!\u2026The unit.It was business as usual.He had reached the office on the dot. The moment he arrived, Jia Yan had already begun announcing the listenership ratings rankings. Zhang Ye already knew that his segment was still last in place yesterday, so he did not give any face by listening to the ratings. He did not listen to it at all, as he went to the recording studio to record the day\u2019s program.\u201cHello, children. Recently, there have been many heinous cases of people abducting children and burglarizing the house when parents are not around in Beijing. Hence, I\u2019ll be telling everyone a short story. Its name is \u201cLittle Bunnies Be Good\u201d. I hope everyone will not open the door to strangers from today onwards!\u201d\u201cMommy Bunny had three children. One was called Little Red Eyes, one was called Long Ears, and one was called Stumpy Tail.\u201d\u201cLittle Bunnies be good; open the door.\u201d\u201cCome open quickly; I want to come in.\u201dIn terms of singing ability, Zhang Ye was like an ordinary person. He had no foundation, but neither was it too bad. After all, he was a student of the Broadcasting major. In terms of volume control, voice control and lung capacity, Zhang Ye was not that bad. It was actually pleasing to the ear when he sang the children\u2019s song.\u201cNot opening, not opening. We\u2019re not opening!\u201d\u201cMommy hasn\u2019t returned yet. We won\u2019t open it for anyone!\u201dAfter singing it a few times and having re-recorded it a few times, Zhang Ye was finally satisfied. He called Assistant Xiaofang to help him arrange the recording tape.The moment Xiaofang came in, she stammered, \u201cTeacher Zhang, your\u2026your segment\u2019s rating\u2026\u201d\u201cIt was last, right? I knew about it yesterday. It\u2019s alright.\u201d Zhang Ye did not make a fuss.Xiaofang was even more worried than him as she said, \u201cBut tomorrow and the day after, it will be finished over the weekend. \u2018Old and Young Story Club\u2019 will be taken off-air; then, you would not have any segments after that!\u201dZhang Ye said, \u201cIsn\u2019t there another two days? No one will know what the outcome would be until the end.\u201dAt noon, the program was broadcast. Zhang Ye did not go to lunch, as he was worried over his listenership rating. However, Zhao Guozhou and two other Leaders of the channel did not come to work, as they seemed to be having a meeting somewhere. It was apparently for the Mid-Autumn Festival\u2019s Poem Meet next week, organized by the Beijing\u2019s Writers Association and the Beijing Radio Station. It was even going to be broadcasted live. Since the Mid-Autumn Festival was approaching, everyone was busy preparing for\u00a0it. As such, Zhang Ye had no way of knowing the rating beforehand. As there was no news of the promotion of \u201cLittle Bunnies Be Good\u201d, both on the television and the newspapers, Zhang Ye felt a chill in his heart.\u2026The next day, Saturday.Today, most of the colleagues had come, as they collectively worked overtime.\u201cTeacher Jia, have you finished recording the first episode?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve finished recording the first two episodes. What do you think?\u201d\u201cIt was very good. The quality was very high. I think it can enter the top ten.\u201d\u201cTeacher Jia, you sure are awesome. The station will belong to you young people from now on.\u201dThe moment Zhang Ye came to the office, he saw Jia Yan mingling with his colleagues. He was in the middle, being complimented. Jia Yan seemed to enjoy that feeling.Jia Yan suddenly saw Zhang Ye as he smirked, \u201cHey, Teacher Zhang is here? I was just looking for you. We should have a transition for our programs.\u201dZhang Ye put down his stuff as he sat down, without giving him a look.Jia Yan\u2019s expression sank, \u201cOn Monday, my program will be broadcast. Tell the listeners over the weekend about this and also promote my program. Is that alright?\u201d After some hesitation, he said, \u201cTeacher Zhang, I know what you are thinking and you have your views. You can\u2019t accept the outcome of the segment being axed, but this was already decided long ago by the station. If a segment always sits at the bottom in terms of listenership ratings, then the station would do their adjustments to the segments or even axe them according to reality. Today, programs with fairy tale stories are at an all-time low. This is the underlying trend. Every radio and television station have begun their adjustments to children\u2019s programs. No one can save them, so I hope you would consider the bigger picture and make way for my segment.\u201dZhang Ye glanced at him, \u201cI do not need a rookie like you to tell me what is the big picture. Just do your own things well. When was it your place to meddle in my affairs?\u201d\u201cAre you picking a fight?\u201d Jia Yan turned angry.Zhang Ye laughed, \u201cI come to work to do my job and do my work. Here you come, trying to educate me, so who is the one picking a fight?\u201d\u201cLittle Zhang, what sort of attitude is that?\u201d Wu Datao, who had a grudge with Zhang Ye, shouted, \u201cWhy is there so much malice in your words?\u201dZhang Ye looked at him and said, \u201cThis is my attitude. In the past and in the future, it will always be like this. I do not need someone teaching me how I should be. I still have the same words to say, \u2018Old and Young Story Club\u2019 will carry on broadcasting. This segment is being hosted by me and my segment doesn\u2019t need people telling me what to do! You want to take over the Literature Channel\u2019s afternoon show? Alright, wait until your segment really goes on air before talking!\u201dJia Yan took up his challenge, \u201cAlright! Let\u2019s wait and see!\u201dTian Bin laughed, \u201cZhang Ye, you did not see yesterday\u2019s listenership ratings, right?\u201dAn old anchorman in the channel said, \u201cLittle Zhang, I have listened to Old Feng\u2019s segment all these years. Although I do not want it to end, but reality shows that it cannot keep up with the times. The quantity of children\u2019s fairy tales is too low, and the quality of the works are too poor as well. It is the trend.\u201dTeacher Feng, who was sitting beside Zhang Ye, also let out a long sigh.Another middle-aged editor said, \u201cWe can understand how you want to make your segment do well, but one needs to face the facts. You should begin preparing for the end of the segment.\u201dThere were people who kicked him while he was down, while others took a schadenfreude attitude. Everyone began chiming in to \u201ceducate\u201d Zhang Ye.Hearing all the chatter, Wang Xiaomei also got irritated. She said, \u201cThe segment will definitely end, but how Teacher Little Zhang wants it to end, he definitely has his own opinion. So there\u2019s no need for everyone to keep chiming in, right? Can\u2019t you mind your own business?\u201dThe old anchorman frowned, \u201cXiaomei, can\u2019t us few comrades say something to a newcomer? Can\u2019t we advise him when his thoughts are problematic?\u201dZhang Ye laughed, \u201cI surely do not think my thoughts are problematic. I want to use a positive attitude to do my segment well. Is that thought problematic?\u201dTian Bin snorted, \u201cBut can you do it well?\u201dJia Yan waved his hand, \u201cLet\u2019s not say anymore. It\u2019s not like he will listen.\u201dWu Datao shook his head and said, \u201cTrying to chase up by to one or two spots higher is a positive attitude. To let it go from the bottom to the top ten? Then that is reaching beyond one\u2019s grasp! Indulging in fantasy!\u201dSomeone came in from outside!\u201cWho will take the ratings table?\u201d It was a staff member from the Statistics department.\u201cGive it to me.\u201d Jia Yan pretended like he was the Leader. He slowly walked over to take the form. After the Statistics department staff left, he did not take a look and just said to everyone, \u201cI\u2019ll announce the ratings for yesterday.\u201d This feeling was quite wonderful. He had high expectations for his future. He also thought highly of his own segment. Just thinking of his segment\u2019s rating increasing day by day, and then getting a position in the station through his connections, he will then definitely fix that Zhang!Everyone was inattentive. Few cared, as it was pointless. The station\u2019s ratings were pretty much fixed. It was almost the same every day, as it was difficult to have any change.Teacher Feng also did not pay attention. It could be said that he didn\u2019t even want to hear it.\u201cFirst place\u2026\u201d Jia Yan announced, \u201cTeacher Wang Xiaomei\u2019s \u201cTalk About the World\u201d. Listenership 3.87%.\u201dBack then when Wang Xiaomei\u2019s rating broke four, it was due to abnormal circumstances. However, even though it never broke four again, \u201cTalk About the World\u201d had gained an increase in listeners after the university student\u2019s suicide matter. As such, its ratings were much higher than before.Everyone gave a token round of applause before they lowered their heads to busy themselves with work.\u201cSecond\u2026\u201d Upon seeing this, Jia Yan\u2019s hands suddenly trembled. It was as if he had seen a ghost as his eyes widened, \u201cThis!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cTeacher Jia?\u201d\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you reading it?\u201dEveryone felt something was amiss as they all looked over.Wu Datao laughed, \u201cWhy? Did my \u2018Entertainment Daily\u2019\u2019s rating increase again?\u201d\u201cEntertainment Daily\u201d always took second spot in the Literature Channel. Due to the special nature of the segment, the broadcasting host would take turns. It was usually a man and woman duo. Now, it was Wu Datao and a female host who took over the hosting. The week\u2019s ratings had been good, as they had steadily increased.Jia Yan did not reply.Wu Datao was dazed. What? I\u2019m not second?Everyone was shocked, too. It was impossible! \u201cEntertainment Daily\u201d was a news segment! This type of program had never dropped below second place!Then who was it?\u2018Late-night Ghost Stories\u2019? Impossible! A late-night segment did not have such an audience base!With everyone paying attention, Jia Yan paused for a long while before vaguely saying, \u201cSecond place is\u2026\u2019Old and Young Story Club\u2019. Listenership 2.40%!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Impossible! Absolutely impossible. This was what everyone thought by default! What sort of segment was \u201cOld and Young Story Club\u201d? This was a pathetic segment that had been lining the bottom or the second from the bottom of the rankings over the years. Even \u201cLate-night Ghost Stories\u201d, which was even worse, could jump up to a ranking of around ten on the first day of a new novel. However, \u201cOld and Young Story Club\u201d had never managed to do so before. It\u2019s best result was 18th place! This was also because of an \u201cexplosive\u201d special program on Children\u2019s Day five years ago!Second? Listenership rates of 2.40%? And it had even exceeded a news-related program like \u201cEntertainment Daily\u201d? No one believed what they had just heard!Wu Datao got angry for no reason, \u201cDid you read it wrongly?\u201dJia Yan also wished he had wrongly, \u201cIt\u2019s written\u2026like this.\u201d\u201cImpossible.\u201d Tian Bin also did not believe. \u201cGoing from last place to second? It\u2019s obvious that such a thing is impossible!\u201dJia Yan nodded. He looked at the ratings report and said, \u201cI\u2019m sure Statistics made a mistake. There\u2019s no point announcing further. The rankings after this would all not be accurate. I\u2019ll go up and find someone from Statistics!\u201dUpon hearing this, Zhang Ye exploded, \u201cWhat do you mean by this? Eh? When my listenership rating is at the bottom, you think it\u2019s normal and take it for granted. Now that my listenership rating has turned for the better, you say Statistics made a mistake? Everything follows what you say? Everything you say must be the truth?\u201d Zhang Ye coldly stared at everyone who doubted him, \u201cI want to ask you! When has the station ever made a mistake with the statistics? Has there ever been once? Oh, so you having good results is justified? While me having good results is an error? What sort of people are you!\u201dJia Yan knew his words were a bit over the top, but he insisted, \u201cEveryone is questioning the statistics. We must first check it. After all, the jump is too great of an exaggeration!\u201dZhang Ye quipped, \u201cSure, you can check. Then\u2026 what will happen if there\u2019s nothing wrong? Will you take responsibility for the words you just said?\u201dJia Yan looked at him and was sure that there was a mistake, so he said, \u201cIf the statistics are free of errors, I can apologize to you.\u201d\u201cAlright, go check it.\u201d Zhang Ye was confident. This confidence came from trusting his story. Although he, too, did not know how the rating had suddenly jumped up by so much, he knew that this story was an impeccable classical masterpiece from his world. It could not be bad!Jia Yan left, while others began to whisper.\u201cIs that true?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s a mistake.\u201d\u201cI think so, too. If not, it would be too great of an exaggeration.\u201d\u201cRight. Teacher Feng has been at it for so many years, yet his ratings have always been at the bottom. How could the rating explode in just three days\u2019 time when in Zhang Ye\u2019s hands?\u201d\u201cWait and see. Little Jia should be back soon.\u201dTeacher Feng quickly pulled Zhang Ye over, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201dZhang Ye said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. The rating is definitely normal.\u201dTeacher Feng rolled his eyes, \u201cYou can still call this normal? This is too abnormal. If you got 19th or 20th, I could definitely believe it, but 2nd? It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t believe you, Little Zhang. It\u2019s just that\u2026 Do you think our unpopular program can get a better listenership rating than a news-related program like \u2018Entertainment Daily\u2019?\u201dZhang Ye blinked, \u201cWhy not?\u201dTeacher Feng said, \u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018why not?\u2019 It\u2019s like on television\u2026 Have you seen a program have higher ratings than the Central TV\u2019s news broadcast?\u201dActually, for this, Zhang Ye had actually seen such a case in his world!\u201cForget it. Let\u2019s wait for the outcome, before we speak further.\u201d Teacher Feng\u2019s mind was in a mess, too.Over there, Jia Yan came back. Checking such a thing could be done very quickly.Tian Bin and Wu Datao asked, \u201cWas it written wrongly? The names were messed up, right?\u201dJia Yan remained silent as he looked with an ashen face at Zhang Ye.Zhang Ye also smiled back at him. He stretched out his right hand and, with a snap of his fingers, he did a very complicated motion.Jia Yan blinked his eyes, before holding in his temper, \u201cSorry, Teacher Zhang, for doubting your results. Statistics had counted it once again\u2026 There was no mistake!\u201dWhat?It was the real listenership rating?Wu Datao and Tian Bin stared, agape!Zhang Ye accepted his apology and said with an educative tone, \u201cThere is no program that can\u2019t do well forever. In the future, your first reaction to a person\u2019s program having a good rating should not be of doubts and rejection!\u201d Following that, he looked towards Wu Datao and Tian Bin, who had been the first to point out the error in the statistics. \u201cDo you have nothing to say?\u201dTian Bin naturally would not apologize. He pretended not to hear.Wu Datao also did his own things, having lost all of his momentum.Zhang Ye did not spare them as he said to them, \u201cBy my own efforts, I made the program do better and better. I did everything in an orthodox fashion. Based on what did you say that my listenership rating was fake? Or wrong?\u201dAn elder in the station tried to smooth things over, \u201cForget it, Teacher Little Zhang. It is not that everyone is targeting you.\u201dAt this moment, Li Si suddenly shouted, \u201cQuick, look at the news! Beijing\u2019s Education Ministry had issued a document earlier this morning! It required every junior kindergarten and all elementary schools in Beijing to have access to the children\u2019s fairy tale, \u2018Little Bunnies Be Good\u2019. They have even sent a \u2018Letter to the Parents\u2019 to let the story, \u2018Little Bunnies Be Good\u2019 be completely immersed in both school and family. They have suggested that parents learn and teach it to their children, so as to strengthen the educative need to never open the door to strangers!\u201dJia Yan was somewhat aware of this. He had also heard about the Essay Competition on the news, \u201cIt\u2019s that Essay Competition event held by the Education Ministry? So what about it?\u201dAn editor said, \u201cWhat\u2019s the fuss?\u201dLi Si smiled bitterly and did not say a word.A woman beside Li Si looked at his screen and immediately turned dumbfounded. After swallowing a mouthful of saliva, she exclaimed, \u201cFor this Essay Competition, the first place was \u2018Little Bunnies Be Good\u2019\u2026Heavens! It\u2019s written by our Teacher Zhang Ye! He had obtained first place after suppressing good Teachers like Tao Xueru and Little Red Mushroom!\u201dZhang Ye added on, \u201cYesterday, that was the story that was broadcasted at noon!\u201d When he heard this, he, too, understood. So this was what had happened. No wonder his listenership rating had gone so high. Previously, he believed that the newspapers had not advertised for him, but who knew that the Education Ministry had issued a direct order. How many kindergartens were there in Beijing? How many elementary schools were there? How many of them were young students? It was nearly uncountable! Having disseminated to the students by the schools, wouldn\u2019t the teachers have to listen to it, too? The students had to listen, right? Even more parents had to listen to it, too, right? That was why the listenership rating had such a miraculous leap! This was like textbooks. You don\u2019t like them? You still need to read them, even if you didn\u2019t like them! It was like mandatory education! Everyone had to learn!The woman quickly followed up, \u201cMy son and I have heard of \u2018Little Bunnies Be Good\u2019. His kindergarten even printed brochures about it. Teacher Little Zhang, so that story was written by you?\u201dZhang Ye said, \u201cYes, Big Sis Zhou. That day, I saw the Essay Competition and decided to do something for the children. With some inspiration, I wrote a piece.\u201dThe woman praised, \u201cYou wrote very well. My son really loves it.\u201dWang Xiaomei looked at Zhang Ye, \u201cThe children\u2019s fairy tales for the past few days of \u2018Old and Young Story Club\u2019 were also written by you?\u201dZhang Ye acknowledged and said in a low-key manner, \u201cYes. I just wrote it haphazardly.\u201dTeacher Feng exclaimed, \u201cYou did not use the story scripts that I gave you? You really wrote the stories yourself?\u201d Zhang Ye had told him that if the fairy tales industry was low in quality, then he would write his own fairy tales. However, Teacher Feng never expected Zhang Ye to really write them. He thought that he was joking!Zhang Ye was at a loss of whether to laugh or cry, \u201cTeacher Feng, could it be that you haven\u2019t been listening to my program over the past few days? This is a segment that you have been broadcasting for so many years, and you didn\u2019t listen?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t. *cough* I did not dare to listen.\u201d Teacher Feng\u2019s face was a little red. It was not right for him to not listen to it at all.Zhang Ye explained, \u201cThe few stories were all written by me. I have some experience and talent in writing after all. Sorry for incurring the ridicule of everyone.\u201dIncurring the ridicule?Many people could sense the sarcasm in Zhang Ye\u2019s words!After they put down the things on their hands, everyone searched on the internet. All they saw were praises and discussions on the internet message boards!\u201cThe story is too awesome!\u201d\u201cLittle Bunnies be good; open the door. Haha, Teacher Zhang Ye really sang it well!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. This children\u2019s song is marvellous. And it\u2019s very simple. You can learn it instantaneously.\u201d\u201cMy daughter has already learned this song, but she still wants me to tell the story every day. I\u2019ve no way out. From today onwards, I will have to listen to Teacher Zhang Ye\u2019s program at noon.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need for today onwards. Check the past two episodes.\u201d\u201cThere are more in the previous two episodes? I\u2019m already sick of listening to those children\u2019s fairy tales.\u201d\u201cNo, the previous two episodes were also original fairy tales written by Teacher Zhang Ye. One of them is \u201cSnow White and the Seven Dwarves\u201d, and another is \u201cThe Emperor\u2019s New Clothes\u201d. They are extremely good stories and have a moral behind them. From a literary perspective, it is even better than \u2018Little Bunnies Be Good\u2019!\u201d\u201cReally? Then I\u2019m going to take a listen!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve heard it. Now, I\u2019m really astounded by Teacher Zhang Ye!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve decided that as long as Teacher Zhang Ye is around, I will not miss a single episode of \u2018Old and Young Story Club\u2019. After listening to it, I can tell it to my twins at night!\u201d\u201cHey, did you notice it? The Beijing Radio Station\u2019s website has a notice of programs going off-air. Why is the name \u2018Old and Young Story Club\u2019 inside it? How can such a good program be taken off-air?\u201d\u201cIt can\u2019t be?\u201d\u201cReally. I\u2019ll send you the link!\u201d\u201cAh? It\u2019s really true? It\u2019s being taken off-air?\u201d\u201cHoly sh*t! Is the radio station dumb? How can such a good program be taken off-air?\u201d\u201cHai, maybe there won\u2019t be many episodes left. Everyone hear as many as you can. There will be one fewer episode after every listen.\u201d\u201cIt can\u2019t go off-air. If it does, I\u2019ll send complaints. What the heck! Do they even have any aesthetic taste?\u201dOver there, Xiaofang had brought the letters from the readers. Knowing that Zhang Ye had obtained second place, pushing Wu Datao\u2019s news program down, Xiaofang was extremely overjoyed. The amount of letters in her hands was nearly half the height of a person. She nearly could not bring them over by herself. \u201cTeacher Zhang, your letters.\u201dZhang Ye stood up and took them over, \u201cWhich stack is mine?\u201dXiaofang said happily, \u201cAll of them. The other Teacher\u2019s letters are still in the mail room. I couldn\u2019t bring them over.\u201dAh? These are all mine?There must be a thousand letters here, right?Teacher Feng marveled, \u201cThis number of letters must have broken a record, right? Our channel has never had more than a thousand letters sent from listeners!\u201dXiaofang smiled gently, \u201cThat\u2019s right. The rest of the letters received today, when added up, aren\u2019t as many as this.\u201dZhang Ye wiped the sweat from his forehead. He lifted the letters over and began reading. They were mostly written by parents. There were tens of them which were written by children. It was easy to see at a glance, as the characters were all crooked. They looked very innocent.Everyone looked at each other, for they no longer had words to describe their current feelings. Back then, Zhang Ye had made the bold statement that \u201cOld and Young Story Club\u201d would not be taken off-air. They had not believed it, nor did they take it to heart. However, now, Zhang Ye had used his abilities and his program\u2019s rating to make everyone shut up. Everyone even had a thought that they had never thought of before!It\u2019s already in second place!Will \u201cOld and Young Story Club\u201d really not be axed?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 46": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I\u2019m Really a SuperstarCH 45Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 45:\u00a0The Serialization of \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d!Afternoon.The atmosphere in the office was very awkward.Tian Bin was full of envy. Jia Yan, normally proud and full of confidence, also felt like he was now sitting on a cushion full of needles. He felt uncomfortable and had an ominous feeling. The breakout of \u201cOld and Young Story Club\u201d has given them significant stress. Wu Datao was annoyed about how \u201cEntertainment Daily\u201d had suffered an unprecedented slip from 2nd place, never before seen in its history!Zhao Guozhou did not appear in the office for the whole day. Everyone was sure that he knew about Zhang Ye\u2019s results, but no one made a sound, as they all simultaneously chose to remain silent. No one could tell what the other was thinking about. In accordance with regulations, a program\u2019s last broadcast could only be decided by its ratings. Programs which placed badly for a long period of time were cut. But never had a program scheduled to be cut had its ratings increase so explosively. How should this situation be handled? Stop broadcasting? Continue broadcasting? The leader was silent about this and no one could really answer this either. But silence could also be a sign!Xiaofang called out, \u201cTeacher Zhang, the recording studio is ready.\u201d\u201cOkay. Thanks for the hard work. I will head over immediately.\u201d Zhang Ye switched off his monitor.When he got up, Teacher Feng, whom he shared a table with, gave him a thumbs up. \u201cCome on; write another good story. Failure or success will depend on these two days.\u201d Teacher Feng had become hopeful now; perhaps the young Little Zhang could really create a miracle this time!\u201cI understand.\u201d Zhang Ye replied.As everyone watched on, Zhang Ye went to the recording studio.As for the Leader\u2019s thoughts, Zhang Ye had his own assumptions. Jia Yan was Deputy Station Head Jia\u2019s relative; he would surely be well taken care of. But Zhang Ye was just a rootless duckweed and had even offended the Station Leader before. He would surely not be preferentially treated. It could then be said that if Saturday and Sunday\u2019s ratings had a tremendous drop, the Leader would not hesitate to axe \u201cOld and Young Story Club\u201d. But if the ratings could maintain at 2.40% or even higher, then the situation would not necessarily be fixed. With the results placed in front of them, they could not move him even if they wanted to!So how was he to keep the ratings consistent?Zhang Ye did not rush to record his program, but pondered in the recording studio for a long time. The situation was to his advantage now. Through the promotion of \u201cLittle Bunnies Be Good\u201d and through the official announcement of the Education Ministry, many parents had already become audience members of his program. Zhang Ye had to make these people stay on and not let them leave after the fad was over. He also had to make some plans for his program!Got it!A serial!In this world, a serialized fairy tale might seem unfamiliar. To the people, a story is a story. It ends after it has been read to the end. But in Zhang Ye\u2019s new world, this was more common. There were uncountable famous stories which were serialized.Why did he choose a serialization?Firstly, Zhang Ye planned to gather popularity through serialization. For example, some sitcoms may have episodes which could stand on their own. There was not much continuity, therefore viewers were less enthusiastic towards it; even if they skipped an episode, it would not affect them much, as every story was independent. But serialization was different; a story that was read daily for 18 days would be affected if you missed a part in the middle. So listeners would be more enthusiastic about listening in to every episode. Secondly, since the station had sent out the notice that the segment would be axed after Sunday, by using a serialization, it was impossible to finish narrating it on Sunday. It was clear that he did not want to hand it over, and this would also give the station a problem. Since you can play dirty with me, am I not allowed to play dirty as well!?This method was quite wicked, but Zhang Ye did not care. If others were good to him, he would return it without question. However, when others kept gunning for him again and again, then Zhang Ye did not care anything about professional ethics!What story to choose?Zhang Ye\u2019s eyes rolled and, with a flash, he opened the game ring and saw that he still had quite a lot of Reputation points. He then went into the Merchant Shop to buy a \u201cMemory Search Capsule\u201d. These days, the Reputation gained from the accumulation of \u201cLate-night Ghost Stories\u201d and the result at the Essay Competition with \u201cLittle Bunnies Be Good\u201d had increased Zhang Ye\u2019s Reputation to 200,000, as tallied by the game ring. \u201cLate-night Ghost Stories\u201d would give 20-30,000 Reputation points on a daily basis, which was not a lot. The main reason was the fame gained from the Essay Competition. So he did not feel the pinch from spending 100,000 Reputation points to buy the capsule. After eating it, Zhang Ye immediately recalled a complete, full-length children\u2019s fairy tale.It\u2019s this!He began recording!\u201cChapter 1: The Cyclone. Dorothy lived in the midst of the great Kansas prairies with Uncle Henry, who was a farmer, and Aunt Em, who was the farmer\u2019s wife. Their house was small, for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon many miles. There were four walls, a floor and a roof, which made one room. And this room contained a rusty-looking cookstove, a cupboard for the dishes, a table, three or four chairs and the beds.\u201dThat\u2019s right. The children\u2019s fairy tale that Zhang Ye had chosen was \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d!Why did he choose it? This was because Zhang Ye had read this growing up. Although the translated names could cause some reading difficulty, history had told Zhang Ye that it would not be a problem. Children could perfectly accept it. There was no need to say how classic this children\u2019s fairy tale was. Not many people in Zhang Ye\u2019s world were ignorant of its existence. And one of the reasons Zhang Ye chose \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d was because this story was different from \u201cLittle Bunnies Be Good\u201d or \u201cThe Emperor\u2019s New Clothes\u201d. It was not limited to an audience below the age of twelve. \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d was a fairy tale that was suitable for all ages!Boys? Girls?Adults? Old people?It covered all age groups! This was extremely rare among children\u2019s fairy tales!Zhang Ye still remembered when he had just became a freshman. He had watched the animation and television drama version of \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d, together with his parents. His parents had also liked it a lot.Wouldn\u2019t some people say that \u201cSnow White\u201d was the same? Actually, it\u2019s not the same. \u201cSnow White\u201d was also a work that managed to wipe out all age groups. It had many animations and movies, but the point was that they were adapted. For example, \u201cSnow White and the Huntsman\u201d, \u201cSnow White and the Magic Mirror \u201c, etc. These had changed almost everything beyond recognition from the original version\u2019s foundation. And, to put it bluntly, even \u201cSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs\u201d itself was not the original version. The original version sure was bloody, so let\u2019s not talk about it.From this angle, for \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d to cater to all ages was a very rare exception!If there was a flaw that could be picked, it was that \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d first came out as a live-action version, and not as a children\u2019s fairytale. So this might make it seem risky, but he still needed to take the risk, even if it was risky.Zhang Ye knew very well that if \u201cOld and Young Story Club\u201d only depended on the listenership ratings from children, then it was not enough. For example, for yesterday\u2019s program, most of the listeners were parents. If the parents were listening in, so as to read stories to their children, then it would be too passive. One or two days may work, but problems would surface down the road. Hence, Zhang Ye had a great idea. This fellow decided to pull the children\u2019s parents in as the fans of his story. By telling them a story that they would also like, this would further secure his segment\u2019s listenership ratings!\u201cChapter 2: The Council with the Munchkins\u201d\u201cShe was awakened by a shock, so sudden and severe that if Dorothy had not been lying on the soft bed, she might have been hurt. As it was, the jar made her catch her breath and wonder what had happened.\u201d\u2026At noon, the program was broadcast.Many colleagues, who were having their lunch break, began to listen in to \u201cOld and Young Story Club\u201d, while having lunch in the office. Previously, they had not paid attention to this segment. But now, due to Zhang Ye\u2019s thunder, and it also being placed first in the Essay Competition and it also being promoted by the Education Ministry, who was not curious after he had obtained that terrifying listenership rating? Of course, everyone paid attention to it. They wanted to know what was so good about Zhang Ye\u2019s fairy tales. Why was it so sought after by so many people? Wasn\u2019t it just a children\u2019s fairy tale? Why would it be different from other children\u2019s fairy tales authors? Those fairy tale masters, who had been working in the industry for so many years, could not save the industry as it deteriorated by the day. But\u2026 Why did it work when it was you?However, upon listening, almost everyone cheered. They finally understood why Zhang Ye had managed to obtain first place in the Education Ministry\u2019s Essay Competition!\u201cIt\u2019s too good!\u201d\u201cThis Little Zhang has turned divine!\u201d\u201cIs this a children\u2019s fairy tale? Why do I like it so much?\u201d\u201cThe Wizard of Oz? Is this another original work of Teacher Little Zhang? I really do not know how his brain works. He\u2019s good at poems, good at supernatural stories, but even his fairy tales are so good?\u201dA few female colleagues began chiming in.After they discussed for a long while, a woman sought out Zhang Ye, who was eating his lunch from a lunch box, \u201cTeacher Little Zhang, what happens next\u00a0in \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d? Tell us what will happen first.\u201dZhang Ye dryly laughed, \u201cDon\u2019t be like that, Big Sis Zhou. You can hear it tomorrow.\u201dBig Sis Zhou said, \u201cWe can\u2019t wait any further. My daughter knows that you are my colleague. The moment she finished listening to the program, she gave me a call and asked me to find out what happens later. If you don\u2019t give it to me, I really can\u2019t face my daughter. Hehe. What do you think, kid?\u201dZhang Ye scratched his head, \u201cBig Sis Zhou, I really can\u2019t do it. Actually, I haven\u2019t thought of it yet. You know that I never have a script and I just narrate as it comes to my head. I haven\u2019t planned it well for what happens later. Listen to it tomorrow.\u201d After finding an excuse, he finally managed to drive them away by deluding them.Some praised, while others shook their heads.Jia Yan was one of those who did not believe it would do well. When he went downstairs for lunch, he had secretly listened to Zhang Ye\u2019s program. The story was still alright, but\u2026 it was a serial? You actually made a children\u2019s fairy tale a serial? Are you joking!? Even the two fairy tale masters, Tao Xueru and Little Red Mushrooms, did not dare attempt this! Do you think children are as patient as adults? Would children follow the story, just because it could not be finished in a day? Is it possible? Children were creatures with short attention spans. The way you think is too simple!However, Jia Yan was happy about this. The more errors Zhang Ye made, the more beneficial it was for him. Of course, he could not let his program be unaired. The time had already been fixed!Teacher Feng came back from lunch, \u201cLittle Zhang, why did you do a serialized broadcast?\u201dZhang Ye winked, \u201cIt\u2019s a serial. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a problem?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s too risky.\u201d Teacher Feng was a professional who had done \u201cOld and Young Story Club\u201d for years. He commented, \u201cYou must know the top master, Tao Xueru, in the industry, right?\u201dZhang Ye said, \u201cI know.\u201d\u201cTeacher Tao had previously tried a serial, but it was not a broadcast type, but a published serial. One book was split into three separate children\u2019s books. And the result? The sales for each book were each worse than the last. The situation where children do not recognize serials is due to their patience. Children may suddenly have the idea of reading a story today and might feel anxious about not knowing how the story ends. But after a period of time, the children will forget it. It is like with toys. They have not settled on their personalities. If Teacher Tao couldn\u2019t succeed, why are you trying to outdo her?\u201d Teacher Feng initially had some hope, but with Zhang Ye\u2019s act, he naturally had to criticize bluntly.A few office ladies stood up for Zhang Ye, \u201cNot really. I think it\u2019s very good?\u201d\u201cMe too. I\u2019m especially looking forward to tomorrow\u2019s story.\u201d another woman said.Teacher Feng said, \u201cThat\u2019s because you are adults; but, children are not the same.\u201d\u201cTeacher Feng.\u201d Zhang Ye made a bold claim, \u201cTeacher Tao not succeeding does not mean I can\u2019t succeed. I shall say something disrespectful. The reason why my essay got first, while Teacher Tao only got third, is because of a problem with the story. Maybe my story is more suitable and is better at grabbing attention than Teacher Tao\u2019s. As long as it\u2019s a good story, a good story that can grab the attention of children, then there would not be a problem serializing it!\u201dTian Bin happened to walk past. He maintained a two-meter \u201csafe distance\u201d from Zhang Ye and said mockingly, \u201cLet\u2019s see the listenership ratings tomorrow!\u201dJia Yan also had similar thoughts. The reason for the explosive ratings was due to special circumstances. The Education Ministry had given an order, so it was no wonder that the ratings were high. However, today was different. One would know if it was a mule or a horse, just from the ratings. Don\u2019t be happy too soon; we shall see your true form tomorrow!In Zhang Ye\u2019s mind, he was thinking, \u201cBring it on. Let\u2019s see what happens tomorrow!\u201dChapter 45: The Serialization of \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was also the end of an old program that had experienced many years.The message boards were made very active by listeners.\u201cThis program cannot end!\u201d\u201cRight; it cannot be taken off-air. Hear that!?\u201d\u201cMy entire family of eight is waiting to hear it!\u201d\u201cIf you end Story Club, do you believe I will smash your radio station\u2019s glass, bastards!?\u201dThe letters Zhang Ye received from the listeners in the morning all showed their strong desire. However, Zhang Ye did not reply. He had no way of responding, as everything depended on Heaven\u2019s wishes.Teacher Feng was holding a bunch of things as he came in. They were all procedural documents.Wang Xiaomei said politely, \u201cUncle Feng, have you settled your retirement?\u201d\u201cI just finished settling it.\u201d Teacher Feng also sighed, \u201cI really can\u2019t bear to.\u201dAnother old editor who had as much experience as Teacher Feng said, \u201cOld Feng, let\u2019s have a last meal in the evening.\u201dHowever, Teacher Feng waved his hands, \u201cThere\u2019s no need. I don\u2019t plan on leaving for the time being. Hehe, I still want to stay behind for another two days, to help Teacher Little Zhang cruise this ship until its end.\u201dEveryone understood that it wasn\u2019t as simple as helping steer the ship. Although Zhang Ye\u2019s personality was not likable, no matter how bad his social popularity was, Zhang Ye\u2019s ability and capacity was not questioned by anyone. Be it \u201cLate-night Ghost Stories\u201d or yesterday\u2019s \u201cOld and Young Story Club\u201d, they had all been brought to even higher heights by Zhang Ye. Such a talented man of God did not need Teacher Feng\u2019s help in steering the ship, so it was clear that Old Feng was still upset with the program he had worked on for so many years ending. He wanted to stay behind to see if \u201cOld and Young Story Club\u201d could carry on existing under the hands of Zhang Ye!\u201cAre the listenership ratings out?\u201d Teacher Feng asked.Zhang Ye volunteered to help Teacher Feng carry his things, \u201cIt\u2019s not out yet. I\u2019m not sure, too.\u201dXiaofang had also come in early, \u201cYou still need to wait for a while. The entire Statistics department was basically resting yesterday, so it will be slower. It should be out soon.\u201dTeacher Feng sighed, \u201cI hope the rating won\u2019t drop too much.\u201dZhang Ye said jokingly, \u201cYou have so little confidence in me.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t believe in you.\u201d Teacher Feng looked at him, \u201cIf I didn\u2019t have any confidence in you, would I have handed the last few days of my segment to you? The reason is because using a serialization yesterday was too sudden. For such a long story to be split into two days is very dangerous. Children might change frequencies midway.\u201dSplit into two days?Yes, everyone thought that Zhang Ye\u2019s story only had two parts. Finishing the serialized story over the course of two days was perfect for the closing.Zhang Ye smiled without speaking. He did not dare tell everyone that the novel, \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d, was actually\u2026 24 chapters long. That is to say, this story needed at least another ten days to finish it! Two days? Less than half the main characters had been introduced, so how could it finish!?Everyone was too naive. They never expected Zhang Ye to so brazenly leave a hanging serialized story without an ending for Jia Yan to take over. Most people would not do something so wicked!Tian Bin chuckled as he looked at Zhang Ye from a distance.Jia Yan, who was busy planning his new segment, was also looking forward to this move of Zhang Ye\u2019s causing a drop in his rating. He estimated that he would be somewhere beyond tenth place. There was no need to give an explanation. Well\u2026 Forget it; I\u2019ll say it. The Education Ministry had only made \u201cLittle Bunnies Be Good\u201d compulsory. People may endorse that story, but it did not mean that they would endorse his other stories. Secondly, having a serialized fairy tale itself was a mistake.Waiting to the left, waiting to the right.Waiting to the top, waiting to the bottom.Waiting to the front, waiting\u2026alright, not doing this already.Someone came in. He was Zhao Guozhou, who had not appeared for two days. He was holding an A4-sized sheet. Clearly, it was the table of yesterday\u2019s listenership ratings.Jia Yan quickly stood up, \u201cDirector.\u201dZhao Guozhou pressed his hand down, \u201cSit. I\u2019ll announce the ratings today.\u201d\u201cOh, alright.\u201d Jia Yan sat down awkwardly.Following that, Zhao Guozhou glanced at Zhang Ye. He had not interacted with Zhang Ye in public for a very long time. In fact, he had not even looked at Zhang Ye in front of others for the past few days. However, for some unknown reason today, Zhao Guozhou had looked at him. His eyes were filled with a complex and deep meaning.Zhang Ye was not sure if it was an illusion. He seemed to see joy and pleasure in Zhao Guozhou\u2019s eyes. Zhao Guozhou was the person who brought him in. He was his\u00a0Bole. That day he had spoken with Zhao Guozhou privately that he would never forget this for life. But to say that he was not angry would be a lie. It was not the truth. Even though Director Zhao had repressed him due to pressure from the station\u2019s management, Zhang Ye still could not accept it emotionally. However, now that he saw the pleasure in Zhao Guozhou\u2019s eyes, Zhang Ye lost all of his anger. He nodded back at him.There was a poem that was most appropriate for this.We remain brothers despite all the vicissitudes and to have an unfaithful wife appearing\u2026 Hai, that\u2019s not right. It\u2019s: let\u2019s forgo our grudges by smiling when we meet again!At this moment, Zhang Ye was even more curious about his listenership rating yesterday. Why would Director Zhao change so much today?\u201cFirst place, Wang Xiaomei. \u2018Talk About the World\u2019.\u201d Zhao Guozhou spoke, \u201cListenership 3.66%. It has dropped compared to the past few days. Teacher Xiaomei, you might need to add something interesting to the segment. It can\u2019t be too dry. I heard the program yesterday; it seemed like you were resting on your laurels.\u201dWang Xiaomei nodded, \u201cI\u2019ll improve on it today.\u201dZhao Guozhou laughed, \u201cActually this result is already very good. You are a pillar of our channel, so everyone naturally expects more from you.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201d Wang Xiaomei remained humble.\u201cNext, second place.\u201d Zhao Guozhou shook the form in his hands.At this moment, many people swallowed their saliva. For example, Jia Yan, Zhang Ye and Teacher Feng were extremely nervous.\u201cEntertainment Daily.\u201d Zhao Guozhou said.A smile immediately beamed on Wu Datao\u2019s face. He had finally returned to second place. He had redeemed his previous disgrace! Tian Bin and Jia Yan also heaved a sigh of relief happily!However, before a second of their happiness could pass, Zhao Guozhou\u2019s tone had a 180 degree turn. \u201cEntertainment Daily, I want to criticize your segment team. Especially Wu Datao and Song Yan. You are the two hosting it these days, but the results are dropping every day. Your listenership rating was only 2.21%. Look at all the entertainment news articles you have been doing the past few days. What were they? Can it be more interesting? Is there any news that people are concerned about? Even if there is, it\u2019s all stuff that are scraps after other people have reported it comprehensively. Nothing in the news program shines. How are the reporters for your segment team gathering news leads? How are you announcers reporting it? There were slip-ups during the live broadcast. Do you still want to carry on in this business?\u201dWu Datao immediately turned silent!Zhao Guozhou said, \u201cWith today, your segment has been pushed out of second place for two consecutive days. Today, second place is not yours!\u201dIt\u2019s not \u201cEntertainment Daily\u201d?Then who was it? Whose program?Everyone\u2019s eyes stared widely!Zhao Guozhou announced, \u201cSecond place. Zhang Ye\u2019s \u2018Old and Young Story Club\u2019. Listenership 2.45%!\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d\u201cAiyah!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s \u2018Old and Young Story Club\u2019 again?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s higher than yesterday\u2019s rating by 0.05%?\u201d\u201cIs this going crazy? This segment is going into a craze!\u201dThere were exclamations everywhere. Tian Bin and Jia Yan were both dumbfounded!Teacher Feng also gave a disbelieving expression. It can\u2019t be! It can\u2019t be! Yesterday, it was due to the Education Ministry\u2019s promotion that caused the explosive increase! How did the listenership rating increase again today? Furthermore, it was a serialized fairy tale that no one thought was likely to succeed! Didn\u2019t all those predecessors and masters of children\u2019s fairy tales prove that fairy tales could not be serialized? Why could Zhang Ye manage it? Why was it possible when he did it?Why?No one understood!Only Zhang Ye clenched his fists. It was like a heavy rock had been removed from his chest. Great! Not only did the listenership rating not drop, it had actually increased? Zhang Ye was quite surprised, but he knew the reason behind it. The power of \u201cLittle Bunnies Be Good\u201d only showed its effect today. The second day\u2019s explosive increase was actually in the early stages. Only a tiny portion of people had surged it. However, yesterday and today was the climax of the promotion from the Education Ministry. The newspapers and television stations had reported on it. So although Zhang Ye\u2019s program was not mentioned, information on the internet easily obtainable and a search would allow everyone to know. Hence, when yesterday\u2019s new story was broadcast, a portion of audience who had just listened in for \u2018Little Bunnies Be Good\u2019 would have definitely left. However, at the same time, a surge of parents had appeared, attracted by the fame. This had caused the listenership rating to increase, instead of decreasing!Of course, the most important reason was because of the story!Zhang Ye did not make a wrong bet. \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d, a story well-liked by all ages, had shown its miraculous effects. It had managed to hold on to many parents!Zhao Guozhou lowered his hand, \u201cEveryone, quiet down. I will first praise Teacher Little Zhang here. Back then, when he first took over \u2018Late-night Ghost Stories\u2019, we all knew that it was the worst segment in our channel. It had always been first from the back. However, the first day Teacher Little Zhang took it over, the segment was pulled up to third place. It had created history among late-night programs. Later on, \u2018Old and Young Story Club\u2019 became the channel\u2019s worst segment. There was no improvement shown in its ratings over the years. And this time, with Little Zhang taking it over, the results are open for all to see. Second place. He went from the bottom to second place! Maybe \u2018Old and Young Story Club\u2019 will be taken off-air after today, but I think Teacher Little Zhang\u2019s diligent spirit is something worthy of learning! I wish to say something to everyone! Something that Teacher Little Zhang has taught us! He has used real action to prove it to us \u2013 there is no program that can\u2019t do well forever!\u201dClasping the A4 paper, Zhao Guozhou took the lead to clap!Bba Bba Bba. Teacher Feng was extremely exhilarated. His eyes were a bit wet as he clapped for Zhang Ye with all his strength. His hands turned red from clapping!What a formidable rookie!At this moment, many colleagues who had their reservations about Zhang Ye were completely convinced.However, Jia Yan was in trouble. He was in a predicament. Why did the Leader\u2019s attitude change? What did this mean? To even publicly applaud Zhang Ye? To publicly praise Zhang Ye? Although Zhao Guozhou had previously said that \u201cOld and Young Story Club\u201d would end today, one had to take note that Zhao Guozhou\u2019s words were prefaced with the word \u201cmaybe\u201d. Maybe it would end today; then, could it also mean that it would not end?The ratings were announced one after another.As Zhao Guozhou was about to leave, Jia Yan rushed out into the corridor, \u201cDirector, then my program on Monday\u2026\u201dZhao Guozhou remained kindly to him, \u201cHehe, Little Jia. Let\u2019s talk about it tomorrow. I\u2019m still busy over preparations for the Mid-Autumn Festival\u2019s Poetry Meet. I need to thoroughly supervise it. If there\u2019s anything you need, look for Old Xu.\u201d With that, Zhao Guozhou left while making a phone call on his cellphone.Jia Yan stood alone in the corridor, clearly feeling a bit lonely.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He began to record his program for Sunday.\u201cChapter 3: How Dorothy Saved the Scarecrow.\u201d\u201cDorothy leaned her chin upon her hand and gazed thoughtfully at the Scarecrow. Its head was a small sack stuffed with straw, with eyes, nose, and mouth painted on it to represent a face. An old, pointed blue hat that had belonged to some Munchkin was perched on his head, and the rest of the figure was a blue suit of clothes, worn and faded, which had also been stuffed with straw.\u201d\u201cChapter 4: The Road Through the Forest.\u201d\u201cSo the Scarecrow led her through the trees until they reached the cottage. Dorothy entered and found a bed of dried leaves in one corner. She lay down at once and, with Toto beside her, soon fell into a sound sleep. The Scarecrow, who was never tired, stood up in another corner and waited patiently until morning came.\u201dAfter finishing the story for today, Zhang Ye looked at the time. He had reserved two minutes, so he quickly did the ending which did not seem like an ending. There was no other way out. Since the station did not give him any notice and the Leader did not say anything, Zhang Ye could only follow the original instructions to end his segment. \u201cChildren and our friends in the audience, that will be all for today\u2019s segment. \u2018Old and Young Story Club\u2019 will also end today. This segment has gone on for many years. Here, I\u2019ll thank everyone on behalf of Teacher Feng for the ongoing support. Although I have only taken over this segment for five episodes, I have extremely deep feelings for \u2018Old and Young Story Club\u2019. I have so many things I want to say in my heart that are so complex. Forget it, I won\u2019t say it. Next week, there will be a new segment taking over, called \u2018Soaring Youth\u2019. Please support it.\u201d\u2026Office area.Zhang Ye returned.\u201cYou\u2019ve wrapped it up?\u201d Teacher Feng lamented.Zhang Ye responded, \u201cWrapped up.\u201dTeacher Feng patted him on the shoulder, \u201cIt\u2019s been tough on you.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been tough on you, Teacher Little Zhang.\u201d Big Sis Zhou, who did editing, gave him a thumbs up.Xiaofang also looked towards him, \u201cTeacher Zhang, you\u2019ve worked hard. Teacher Feng, you\u2019ve worked hard.\u201dThis was customary. Every time a segment ended, everyone would say this. It was a form of farewell and was also to show respect for the long-term efforts of the Teachers.Wang Xiaomei and others also said the same words to Teacher Feng and Zhang Ye.Only Jia Yan did not say it. He couldn\u2019t care less, as he was busy with his new segment. Although he had recorded the first two episodes for his program, he had not done the opening and ending. He was secretly writing a script. Why did he write a script secretly? Maybe it was because Zhang Ye never used a script. This was no secret in the entire Beijing Radio Station. Zhang Ye\u2019s \u201cfeat\u201d was often talked about. Zhang Ye was a newcomer and so was Jia Yan; hence, he did not want to lose to Zhang Ye psychologically. He was competitive!Afternoon.The last episode of \u201cOld and Young Story Club\u201d was broadcast.Many office ladies were listening in to Zhang Ye\u2019s program. It seemed to have turned into a rule since yesterday. They all had children, but as parents, they would never find a good children\u2019s fairy tale that could educate their children excessive.\u201cThe Scarecrow, who was never tired, stood up in another corner and waited patiently until morning came.\u201d This was the last sentence for today\u2019s \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d.When everyone heard this, they exclaimed.\u201cIt can\u2019t be? It ended just like that?\u201d\u201cThe story ended? It hasn\u2019t! Isn\u2019t it finished!?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it a serialized four-chapter story that was to be broadcast over two days? Why did it end up like that? This can\u2019t be an ending. A new character has just appeared. Having saved the Scarecrow, the plot has not even developed!\u201d\u201cF**k! There\u2019s still more?\u201d\u201cThere must be more stories that come after! It\u2019s not only four chapters long!\u201dEveryone finally understood it as they nearly fainted!It was unknown who told Jia Yan. He immediately rushed back to the office when he was eating at the cafeteria. He angrily looked for Zhang Ye, \u201cTeacher Zhang! What happened?\u201dZhang Ye feigned ignorance, \u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018what happened?\u2019\u201d\u201cWhat do you think!?\u201d Jia Yan was flustered, \u201cWhy hasn\u2019t your program ended?\u201dZhang Ye blinked, \u201cIt\u2019s already over. I even said the ending and even introduced your program.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not the problem. I\u2019m saying why are there more parts to the serialized story at the back!\u201d Jia Yan was really furious.Zhang Ye said, \u201cI can\u2019t care about that. My story is that long. To speak the truth, not even today, it won\u2019t even be finished next week. There\u2019s a total of 20 more chapters in the series. How can I finish it today? Little Jia, I also want to tell a story that could be finished in two days, but unfortunately, I do not have one. I only came up with \u2018The Wizard of Oz\u2019 recently. There\u2019s no other way around it. After all, I independently created it. Short fairy tale stories aren\u2019t so easily created. Creating a work is not easy.\u201dNot easy?When you composed poems, when has it ever not been done in an impromptu fashion?When you told ghost stories, when was it not done on the spot?Original works may be very difficult for others, but it was definitely nothing for you!Everyone knew Zhang Ye was doing it on purpose. He was wicked! It was too wicked! To leave such a good fairy tale story on a cliffhanger, how was Jia Yan to take over the slot!? Even if he could take it over, wouldn\u2019t he be cursed to death by the loyal listeners of \u201cOld and Young Story Club\u201d? Listeners were originally already unhappy about the ending of the Story Club, with many people saying they would complain or smash windows. Well, maybe they were just speaking nonsense. If Zhang Ye had really finished his story for Story Club, then the end was the end. There was nothing much to it, as time could solve everything. However, now, Zhang Ye had not finished his story. It was a neutered state; wouldn\u2019t this be like blue balls? Wouldn\u2019t this incite the emotions of the listeners? There was nothing more wicked than this!Zhang Ye\u2019s simple response had pushed it back at Jia Yan.Jia Yan turned and left, \u201cI\u2019m not speaking to you, I\u2019ll go to the Leader!\u201dThe moment he left, Teacher Feng felt both angry and happy, as he pointed towards Zhang Ye and whispered, \u201cYou kid, you sure are something.\u201d He laughed at the end.Zhang Ye did not care about this. Were you going to bite me if I wanted to tell the story in such a manner?After some time, Jia Yan returned. He had clearly not found the Leader, as he went back to his seat with a sulking face.The situation had turned more complex. With the Leader not around and him remaining neutral, this matter was completely in a state of limbo. Furthermore, there were listeners of \u201cOld and Young Story Club\u201d already leaving curses on the Radio Station\u2019s official website. The broadcast of today\u2019s episode had caused quite a commotion!\u201cHoly shit! This is too damaging!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been neutered? It became neutered just like that?\u201d\u201cDo not end it! This will take the lives of people!\u201d\u201cMy child has just heard four chapters! If I do not continue telling him the story tomorrow, the child will be rolling on the ground screaming! Teacher Zhang Ye, quickly carry on! Do not stop the broadcast!\u201d\u201cWhat is the radio station doing!?\u201d\u201cTeacher Zhang is so bad! He left an unfinished story for us?\u201d\u201cWhat \u2018Soaring Youth\u2019? We don\u2019t want to listen to it! Return to us our \u2018Old and Young Story Club\u2019!\u201d\u201cRight, return to us our \u2018Old and Young Story Club\u2019! We only want to listen to this!\u201d\u201cLet that \u2018Soaring Youth\u2019 die! Soaring, your sister! With \u2018The Wizard of Oz\u2019 not finished and stuck in the middle! What fart is it soaring!?\u201d\u201cSoar, just jump off the building and you can fly!\u201d\u201cRight, I really feel like jumping off a building! I\u2019m not telling it to my children, as I\u2019m not married yet. It\u2019s because I really love the story!\u201dThere were even children who left messages. Now, children got into contact with advanced technology at a younger age. Thinking back, Zhang Ye only had a computer in high school. Now, children would already have access to that during elementary school. \u201cUncle Zhang Ye, don\u2019t leave. Please do not end it. I want to hear the later parts of \u2018The Wizard of Oz\u2019. This fairy tale is too good. Our school has even left homework for us to listen to your story!\u201dThe response of the crowd was very \u201cloud\u201d.Not to mention others, even a few older ladies in the office could not accept it. Three ladies discussed before surrounding Zhang Ye\u2019s desk, \u201cLittle Zhang, you are too immoral. It\u2019s fine if your program is ending, but you must at least write out the later parts of the story for us. There\u2019s still another 20 more chapters, right? Quickly write. We are waiting!\u201dZhang Ye smiled bitterly, \u201cI\u2019ll try my best, sisters.\u201dBig Sis Zhou said, \u201cYou can\u2019t try your best. You must write it well, or it\u2019s too aggravating!\u201dSuddenly, some parent had left a message on the radio station\u2019s website\u2019s comment section. It was titled, \u201cDo not let the story end. Everyone come in and support.\u201d The content was, \u201cComrades, parents. Everyone probably knows that the Story Club is ending. The power of the masses is the greatest. Let us show our voice and let the radio station see it. Let \u2018Old and Young Story Club\u2019\u201d carry on with its broadcasting!\u201dThere was a sea of responses beneath it!\u201cSupport!\u201d\u201cSupport+1000!\u201d\u201cBoycott \u2018Soaring Youth\u2019!\u201d\u201cReturn the blue skies to the children!\u201d\u201cNowadays, there are already so few children\u2019s fairy tales. The only remaining children\u2019s program on the radio are the Beijing Radio Station\u2019s \u2018Old and Young Story Club\u2019. We must not let the program end. The children still need this segment! The children need Teacher Zhang Ye\u2019s story! Prop it up!\u201dThere were a countless number of messages. There were also many supporters.It was just 2 P.M., which meant that in an hour, there were more than 1,500 messages left on the boards!Radio, which was part of the old media, had already been largely replaced by new media. It had lost its glory days and did not have much of an audience. However, the controversy caused by this matter could make anyone, who looked at the radio station\u2019s website, mistakenly believe that they had returned to the 80\u2019s or 90\u2019s, when the radio was still having its absolute reign. The Big Brother status seemed to return. And the technology and equipment were not prepared for this. The large crowd that flocked to the Beijing Radio Station\u2019s website to show their support or curse had caused the website\u2019s server to nearly crash!This was a big deal!Zhang Ye and many colleagues never expected this. They all jumped from fright!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 49": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I\u2019m Really a SuperstarCH 48Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 48: The Program Won\u2019t Be Axed!Monday.Today was an important day. Zhang Ye woke up at 5 A.M. and could not return back to sleep. After tossing and turning, he reached the unit early. The office was still empty. There was not a single person. Editor Zhang who opened the doors had not arrived, so Zhang Ye had to go downstairs to the lobby to get the key to the Literature Channel, before he managed to enter the room.He watched the news.He checked his name.He searched for comments for his program.These were the three things Zhang Ye did every morning. A glance at the morning news was sufficient. The comments were mostly similar to those of yesterday. Either they were cursing that Zhang Ye was without morals by neutering the story, or they shouted to not have \u201cOld and Young Story Club\u201d end. Zhang Ye was mainly searching for his name and he was surprised to find out that in a day\u2019s time, the number of searches for his name had reached a total of 16,000 times on the country\u2019s biggest search engine website. Although it could not be compared to those A-list celebrities who had hundreds of thousands to millions of searches, it was still a sharp rise. Note that this was not the search numbers of Zhang Ye\u2019s segments. It was also not for his fairy tales or novels, but the two words \u201cZhang Ye\u201d.\u201cGhost Blows Out the Light\u201d having 10,000+ was no surprise, as there was nearly ten thousand searches every day!The search numbers for \u201cLittle Bunnies Be Good\u201d exceeding 10,000 was also no surprise. In fact, it had exceeded 110,000 the day before!They were all searches, but the value of Zhang Ye\u2019s name being searched was completely different. This meant that many listeners who had tuned into the programs had noticed the voice behind the radio, Zhang Ye. This was a mark of his growth in popularity. Zhang Ye\u2019s ambition was to become this world\u2019s greatest and most famous celebrity in the world. He knew how things worked in the industry. Following a particular work was just the beginning stages. It was just popularity on the surface and wasn\u2019t as reliable. This was because once a piece of work \u201cexpired\u201d, people will forget with time. Then this popularity on the surface would also dissipate, and not much popularity would be left. However, if people paid attention to a person, it was different. This had a much deeper meaning in terms of popularity than paying attention to a piece of work.Once his popularity rose, even if it was negative, that was also considered fame. Zhang Ye could feel his dreams taking its initial steps, but it did not stop one bit. He was developing towards his goal with every second.However, even though it was a good thing, he still could not feel happy.This was because the fate of \u201cOld and Young Story Club\u201d was still unknown. If the program was axed, then he would not have a platform for him to disseminate his works. As such, he would not be able to carry on increasing his popularity using high-quality works. The little amount of popularity he had would not be able to be maintained for long before turning to naught in the end.\u201cEh, Little Zhang, you\u2019ve come?\u201d\u201cTeacher Zhang, why are you so early today?\u201dAt around 8 A.M., colleagues began reaching the unit.Teacher Feng had also arrived early. After seeing Zhang Ye, their gazes crossed and after a greeting, no one said anything more. The both of them were aware. Teacher Feng was also waiting for a result. He wanted to see if Zhang Ye was able to create another historical miracle!Quite a number of people were also discussing about this.\u201cDo you think the station will cancel the axing of \u2018Old and Young Story Club\u2019?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that won\u2019t happen. Little Jia is, after all, a relative of Deputy Station Head Jia. Have you forgotten?\u201d\u201cBut now Teacher Little Zhang has made his program perform so well with listenership ratings in second place. If the station did not revoke the notification from before, how much pressure would they need to withstand?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. The listeners paralyzed our station\u2019s official website with all the cursing!\u201d\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that it won\u2019t be axed. There has never been such a precedent.\u201d\u201cPrecedent? A late-night program had never reached the top three in the ratings. A children\u2019s fairy tales segment has never reached second place in the ratings. Precedents are meant to be broken!\u201d\u201cHow would we know what the Leader is thinking? Let\u2019s just wait and see.\u201dAt this moment, Tian Bin had arrived. Jia Yan had also arrived. So no one carried on discussing this topic.The office turned silent, as if everyone was watching Zhang Ye and Jia Yan. Everyone knew that this day belonged to them. It was the day of their battle!At 9 A.M., Zhao Guozhou arrived punctuality. It was clear that he had just arrived at the unit. His hand was still holding a bag. He did not return to his own office first and instead came to announce yesterday\u2019s listenership ratings, \u201cAlmost everyone is here, right? Alright, then stop for a while. I\u2019ll announce the listenership ratings.\u201dEveryone was very serious. Many people were curious about the listenership rating for yesterday\u2019s \u201cOld and Young Story Club\u201d. Although Zhang Ye had succeeded in taking the risk of a serialization on his first day, it was not necessarily the case on the second day. Maybe the listeners did not realize that the story was a series, so they finished listening to it without a second thought. Maybe they would lose their patience on the second day when they realized that it was a serialization? These were all possible. So the rating was clearly crucial for the battle between Zhang Ye and Jia Yan today.\u201cFirst place. \u2018Talk About the World\u2019 listenership 3.81%.\u201d Zhao Guozhou gave a very pleased look at Wang Xiaomei, \u201cTeacher Xiaomei, well done. After telling you off that day, there was a significant improvement in the program yesterday. There were many new things. Hehe, I really liked that part about eating watermelons. Was that something you did on the spot?\u201dWang Xiaomei smiled, \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWell said. Carry on maintaining it. I think breaking four percent on your listenership rating will not be too far off.\u201d After Zhao Guozhou gave his praises, he looked down at the table, \u201cSecond place\u2026\u201dIt was unknown if it was intentional as he paused for a long time.As everyone was looking, hoping to see through the form, Zhao Guozhou said, \u201cSecond place. \u2018Old and Young Story Club\u2019 listenership\u2026\u201d Again he stretched it out. \u201c2.78%!\u201dWow!Everyone went into an uproar!2.78%? What the f***!You must be going mad! Is there anyone that can stop it?One had to know that \u201cOld and Young Story Club\u201d only had zero point something listenership ratings a few days before. Even yesterday\u2019s and the day before\u2019s ratings were around 2.4%. Today, it had increased by slightly more than 0.3%? Didn\u2019t this development mean that it was trending to break three? Holy ****! This was too amazing!Many people drew in a mouthful of air!According to the situation\u2019s development, it would be very hard for \u201cEntertainment Daily\u201d to catch up with \u201cOld and Young Story Club\u201d. It would be a dream for the previous set-in-stone second place to regain the second spot. Uh, it could not be said that way either. This was because the Story Club was going to go off-air today. Without the program, there would not be a listenership rating. Thus, \u201cEntertainment Daily\u201d would regain its second spot without a fight\u2026Teacher Feng was the happiest. He grabbed Zhang Ye\u2019s arm and clutched him tightly.Zhang Ye was already mentally prepared for today\u2019s listenership rating. The day before yesterday was \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d\u2018s first day of serialization. He had carefully selected a fairy tale that would appeal to all ages, so as to retain many of the listeners who had come for \u201cLittle Bunnies Be Good\u201d. The facts had proven that Zhang Ye had managed to do it. Not only had he done it, he had excelled, nearly achieving perfection. Yesterday was the second day of the serialization. Zhang Ye\u2019s goal was not as simple as retaining the audience. Under the premise of creating a new audience base, his goal was to create a habit for people to listen in. By letting them wait for \u2018Old and Young Story Club\u2019 every day for the serialization, there was no way of catching up if one episode was missed. This was also a forceful method of making people accept the serialization of a fairy tale. Now, looking at the listenership ratings, Zhang Ye knew he had managed to do it!As long as \u201cOld and Young Story Club\u201d was not axed, Zhang Ye had every reason to believe that the listenership ratings of \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d would keep increasing!This was the benefit of a serialization!This was the advantage of a serialization!Zhao Guozhou did not praise Zhang Ye like yesterday. He said it in passing before announcing the rest of the listenership ratings. This ambiguous attitude made everyone even more baffled.After he finished announcing, Zhao Guozhou did what he did yesterday. He left after turning around.Jia Yan was also dazed. He was still thinking that Zhao Guozhou would say something. However, in the end, there was nothing. Like yesterday, he ran out to chase after him.\u201cDirector!\u201d\u201cLittle Jia?\u201d\u201cI want to talk to you. Do you have some time?\u201d\u201cSure. Follow me to my office.\u201dOnce they left, Big Sis Zhou worried for Zhang Ye, \u201cLittle Zhang, you should go, too!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s right!\u201d Another person, Aunt Wang, chimed in, \u201cYou should quickly try to grasp an opportunity. Say something nice. Who knows if the Leader might change his mind!\u201dPreviously, Zhang Ye was not popular with his colleagues. Firstly, he had offended the Leader. Secondly, he was new, so he hadn\u2019t had much interaction with others. He did not know many people, which resulted in his poor social popularity. Now, through his fairy tale stories, Zhang Ye had at least managed to gain the liking of the five to six women in the office.Furthermore, with Jia Yan being young and so aggressive that he did not show any respect for Teacher Feng on his first day, there were many older people who did not like him. As such, they slowly leaned towards Zhang Ye. They did not care that Zhang Ye cursed as he had back when he and Tian Bin cursed at each other on the internet. Tian Bin was a person who usually spoke badly of people behind their backs and since he was the person who first instigated the dispute and Zhang Ye was just reacting to it, it was understandable due to the extenuating circumstances.Furthermore, no matter how much a jerk Zhang Ye was, he had never been disrespectful to the older people in the station. When had he never been polite when he met them? Just from this point, Zhang Ye was already in a much better position than Jia Yan in the hearts of the older people!\u201cThere\u2019s no need.\u201d Zhang Ye did not go.\u201cYou care about your face too much. Will lowering your head kill you?\u201d Aunt Wang felt exasperated.Zhang Ye was very clear of the situation, \u201cI have done my things well. I have already put in my greatest efforts into it. The Leader\u2019s decision was likely already decided some time ago. I also won\u2019t be able to change it.\u201dAlthough he said so, the process was quite a torment.Two hours passed since Jia Yan left, but still, he was not seen.Zhang Ye repeatedly looked as his watch. He also went to the Leader\u2019s office, but there was no one there. He returned to the office and asked an old editor, \u201cEditor Xu, the afternoon\u2019s program is about to begin soon. The Leader isn\u2019t around either. What\u2019s going on? What about today\u2019s program?\u201dEditor Xu was also unsure what to do. He could not reach Director Zhao on the phone!Finally as it was approaching noon, Zhang Ye asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen?\u201dEditor Xu slapped his forehead, \u201cLittle Zhang, why don\u2019t you record it first?\u201d\u201cIt can\u2019t be recorded anymore. It can only be broadcast live since it\u2019s this late.\u201d Zhang Ye pointed to his watch.Editor Xu bit his tongue, \u201cThen let\u2019s do a live broadcast. You take the reins. We\u2019ll speak after the live broadcast is over!\u201dZhang Ye agreed and immediately called for his assistant, \u201cXiaofang, quickly reserve a live broadcast studio. The faster, the better.\u201d He picked up a bottle of mineral water to moisten his throat before setting off.\u202612 o\u2019clock.Zhang Ye pushed the volume button, \u201cHello listeners. Due to some special reasons and circumstances, today\u2019s program will still be \u2018Old and Young Story Club\u2019. Let me tell everyone the fifth chapter of \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d, The Rescue of the Tin Woodman.\u201d\u2026Zhang Ye managed to finally finish his program\u2019s live broadcast. He returned to the office from the live broadcasting studio at 1 P.M. Only then did he see Jia Yan, who was silent.When Jia Yan saw Zhang Ye, he had raised his head, but then quickly bowed his head to carry on typing on the computer. He no longer had the aggressive air that he had on his first day.Zhang Ye roughly understood what had happened. He walked towards Teacher Feng, \u201cOur program won\u2019t be axed?\u201dTeacher Feng whispered, \u201cNo talk about not axing, but Director Zhao did not say a word despite knowing you were broadcasting live. His intention is to let us carry on broadcasting. The station has not mentioned anything about axing the program anymore.\u201dZhang Ye heaved a sigh of relief, as if a burden had been lifted, \u201cTeacher Feng, I finally did not disappoint you. I managed to keep the program!\u201dTeacher Feng squeezed his shoulder, \u201cI won\u2019t be coming to the unit tomorrow. You have given me a big gift before I leave! Thank you!\u201d\u201cTo think you have to say that. It\u2019s what should have happened. I also do not wish for the program to end.\u201d Zhang Ye said.Tian Bin was secretly burning with anger. How could it be!? The Leader really tolerated him?Wu Datao could not accept it. The station really did not axe the program? They really were letting Zhang Ye do what was deemed an impossible task?Everyone saw this and felt mixed emotions. The past few days were too dramatic.Thinking back to the day when Zhang Ye declared his bold words, saying that \u201cOld and Young Story Club\u201d would not be axed, none of them had believed him. No one treated him seriously. But by giving Zhang Ye five days, just five days of programming was enough for Zhang Ye to complete a startling reversal. He had managed to change a segment that was dead last to a legendary myth in terms of ratings. The results were so stunning that the station\u2019s management could not say anything!A young person\u2019s abilities must be respected!A new generation was replacing the old!This made people begin to realize that maybe one needed to bow one\u2019s head or compromise at work, but in front of absolute ability and results, many intrinsic beliefs appeared laughable. Jia Yan was an example. So what if he was the Station\u2019s Leader\u2019s relative? A segment that was decided on could still fail to go on air! It similarly could not replace Zhang Ye\u2019s segment. Jia Yan had to queue up obediently in the station! Why? This was because Zhang Ye had handed in a result that no one else could hand in! \u201cOld and Young Story Club\u201d had received second place in the Literature Channel! Its rating was at the tenth place in the entire Beijing Radio Station! Coupled with \u201cLate-night Ghost Stories\u201d being fourth in the Literature Channel and 19th in the entire station! There was no one who could move Zhang Ye\u2019s position in the radio station!This time, Zhang Ye had really rooted himself. He had laid a deep foundation through his hard work and determination!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 50": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I\u2019m Really a SuperstarCH 49Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 49As he had applied for leave, he was taking a day off today.He had recorded one additional episode yesterday, so with the crisis alleviated, Zhang Ye remained at home to sleep.He remained lazing in bed, even when it was already 10 o\u2019clock. He began watching television in bed, switching to one channel after another. Suddenly, Zhang Ye\u2019s hand stopped, as he quickly adjusted the television\u2019s volume. It seemed to be scenes recorded from last night. It was a press conference of a new movie release. The name was familiar; it was called \u201cWhite Maiden 2\u201d. He remembered the day that the game ring had changed his world; one of the first things he had seen on the television\u2019s news were the words \u201cWhite Maiden\u201d. It was produced by one of the more famous directors, Wu Bang, in this world. Its box office sales were very high and now its sequel was being released.Why was Zhang Ye so concerned about it?There was only one reason. The movie\u2019s female lead was too beautiful!When Zhang Ye\u2019s eyes swept across the television, his eyes had remained fixated on her. This world also has many superstar Heavenly Queens. This person was probably the prettiest celebrity Zhang Ye had seen in this world. Right, maybe it should be said that she was most fitting to what he considered the aesthetic of a beautiful celebrity.Wang Xiaomei?Tian Bin\u2019s wife?None of them could compare with her beauty!The only person who could compare was probably Rao Aimin. If the landlady had worn something more fashionable, then the two might be comparable.On the screen, the press conference had ended. Zhang Yuanqi was surrounded by reporters. Even the famous director, Wu Bang, did not stir up such a fuss.\u201cSis Zhang, what are your expectations of the box office sales?\u201d\u201cTeacher Zhang, I heard that you were injured during the filming process?\u201d\u201cCan you tell us the plot of the new movie? Has there been any changes with the prequel?\u201d\u201cSis Zhang, your new song has had unsatisfactory results once again. Are you planning not to develop in the music industry from now on? To focus on your movie career?\u201dThe journalists began rattling off their questions like a machine gun.The onscreen Zhang Yuanqi smiled very amiably. She did not seem to have any airs, \u201cAsk one by one; I will definitely answer them. Well, I definitely hope so! The higher the box office sales, the better, but I will need everyone\u2019s support. I can\u2019t reveal the plot, or else it\u2019s pointless for everyone to watch. Hurhur. As for my injury, sorry for worrying everyone. Thank you very much. It\u2019s already alright. It was just a superficial wound. A bandage healed it the second day after being wounded. It was just exaggerated when the news spread out. It\u2019s not considered an injury.\u201d\u201cTeacher Zhang!\u201d\u201cDo you have any plans for a new film this year?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve heard that you will be one of the judges for the upcoming Golden and Silver Microphone Broadcaster Choice Awards?\u201dZhang Yuanqi said in a pleasant manner, \u201cThere might be a new film being recorded at the end of the year. As for being a judge\u2026 You sure keep abreast with the news. I\u2019ve indeed been invited. My manager is still checking my schedule; if there is no event that cannot be postponed, I will definitely be there.\u201dThe journalists carried on their siege, as they tailed her from behind.Zhang Ye was not sure of Zhang Yuanqi\u2019s age. She looked like she was about thirty years old. She was this world\u2019s Heavenly Queen and was also an S-list superstar. She had won the country\u2019s most authoritative Best Female Lead and Best Supporting Actress awards more than once. A few of her previous songs had even received the Golden Melody Award. She was a celebrity that was involved in several lines of work. If one compared fame and popularity, Zhang Yuanqi was probably ranked in the top five in the country. She would be described as a Heavenly Queen figure amongst Heavenly Queens. Although she was not considered very old, she had a lot of experience. She had debuted very early. In the entertainment industry, Zhang Yuanqi was considered a Big Sister. According to hierarchy, many newcomers would have to address her as Master Aunt. Zhang Yuanqi was pretty and famous. What was most critical was that she was easygoing and elegant. Hence, her position in the entertainment circle was extremely high. She was also very well-liked.Look at her looks!Look at her achievements!Look at her temperament!Zhang Ye knew that he could not envy her. He did not have her looks, so he could only rely on his hard work. And his hard work was based on what? The game ring was the greatest reliance he had!Noon.Zhang Ye ate instant noodles again. He opened the game ring on his finger to check his overall Reputation. There was a total of 230,000 points. Firstly, some of these were accumulated from some time ago. Secondly, some of the Reputation points were earned from the past two days of \u201cLate-night Ghost Stories\u201d and \u201cOld and Young Story Club\u201d. Although \u201cOld and Young Story Club\u201d was not that much higher than \u201cLate-night Ghost Stories\u201d in terms of listenership ratings, the former still brought more than double the Reputation points to Zhang Ye than the latter. After all, a late-night program was now a mainstream program, while \u201cOld and Young Story Club\u201d had already become Zhang Ye\u2019s center of attention.He could draw at the Lottery again.Zhang Ye was only prepared to draw at it once. He needed to leave some Reputation points in reserve, so as to allow him to buy a \u201cMemory Search Capsule\u201d in the event of an unexpected turn of events. After taking this into consideration, Zhang Ye opened the Lottery interface!He spent 100,000 Reputation points!The Lottery began! The needle spun!This time, Zhang Ye was still looking forward to drawing something from the Stats Category or the Skills Category. His luck was too terrible; he had not drawn from either of them, not even once. Of course, it would be even better if he got something from the Special Category.Skills Category\u2026Stats Category\u2026Consumption Category\u2026The needle slipped past one category after another!One time around! Five times around! Ten times around!Zhang Ye began chanting, \u201cSkills! Skills!\u201d Suddenly, he shouted again, \u201cAiyah, why did it go past! It missed by just a bit!\u201dBada!He had hit the Consumption Category once again!Zhang Ye let it be. Since it was a Consumption Category, then so be it. After all, this category took up half the area of the Lottery. Besides, the previous Consumption Category items had helped him a lot. The Consumption Category\u2019s Treasure Chest (Small) automatically entered his inventory. Zhang Ye took it out and placed it on the desk. Then he opened the lid! The chest opened! The familiar gold beams flashed! A pink-colored sachet appeared in the Treasure Chest![ Cupid Sachet ] : Effective once it is worn. Increases the player's luck with the opposite sex for five minutes!Luck with the opposite sex?There was an item that actually increased luck with the opposite sex?Zhang Ye was quite happy. Unfortunately, it was a one-time expendable item. If he could obtain the rights through the Special Category to buy it in the Merchant Shop, then it would be excellent. He could buy an unlimited number of these. Then with it, would he need to worry about having a wife? Wouldn\u2019t buying it and having an uninterrupted 24-hour period of using the Cupid Sachet be so good? Hai, but that was just a thought. Furthermore, he still did not know how the item worked. Zhang Ye understood what the word Cupid meant, but he did not know its actual effects.He hung the sachet around his neck!Ping. Item has been used. Countdown Begins!Seeing the virtual game interface\u2019s effective time countdown, Zhang Ye sat in his seat waiting. However, nothing had happened!Where was his luck with females?Why was there no reaction?Only when there were two minutes left remaining did Zhang Ye realize what was going on. Oh no, he was too naive! It was similar to the Unlucky Halo. If no one had offended him to trigger the Unlucky Halo\u2019s effects after it was activated, then the Unlucky Halo would not do a thing. Similarly, the Cupid Sachet probably was the same. Now that he was alone at home with not even a female around, how was he to have good luck with females? He had to at least first meet a female. Would waiting at home have a girl send herself to his doorstep?Ke La!There were the sounds of keys coming from outside!Dong. Ka. It seemed like someone was stabbing keys into Zhang Ye\u2019s door. But no matter what, the person could not open the door. The person outside seemed angry, as that person began kicking on the door!\u201cWho is it!\u201d Zhang Ye went over with a darkened expression.The person outside did not speak, as the person carried on inserting the key.Zhang Ye opened the door, \u201cStop screwing around! Who is it?\u201dThe moment the door opened, the smell of alcohol came surging over. It nearly caused Zhang Ye to topple backwards. It was too strong. Looking up, it was a woman. She was wearing a pair of wide aviator sunglasses. She looked somewhat familiar, but he could not recall where he had seen her. Zhang Ye only knew that this drunken woman was someone he did not know. The woman clearly had drunk too much. She was still stabbing the empty air with her keys, despite Zhang Ye having opened the door. She was not standing firmly, while wearing her nude-colored heels!Eh?Could this be the good luck with females?Ha! The Cupid Sachet had really sent a woman to his doorstep?\u201cHave you gotten the wrong door?\u201d However, Zhang Ye did not dare to accept this good fortune in love. She was drunk and he was still not clear what was going on.The woman dizzily stared at him, \u201cWho are you? What.. are you doing in my house?\u201dZhang Ye was at a loss as to whether to laugh or cry, \u201cBig Sis, this is my house. Where do you live? I\u2019ll send you home.\u201d However, the moment he saw the key in the woman\u2019s hand, Zhang Ye turned speechless. The keys looked very complicated and it was easy to tell at a glance that it was for a high-grade door lock. There was even an access card, so clearly she did not live in his district.The woman squeezed into the room without standing on ceremony. She also did not listen to Zhang Ye\u2019s words, \u201cYou.. are my mom\u2019s.. cleaner, right? Got.. it!\u201dYou are the cleaner!Your whole damned family are cleaners!*She nearly stumbled as she missed her footing.Zhang Ye quickly rushed to hold her, \u201cLook carefully; this is really my house! Who are you?\u201dThe woman sneered, \u201cI.. You don\u2019t.. know?\u201d As she spoke, she took off her sunglasses. She didn\u2019t manage to do so on her first attempt. It took her a second attempt before succeeding.However, with the sunglasses removed, Zhang Ye was so shocked that his jaw nearly dropped off. Only then did he realize why he found the girl very familiar, even though she was someone that he did not know. Behind the sunglasses was a flawless face. That earth-shattering beauty immediately made Zhang Ye recall!Zhang Yuanqi!Wasn\u2019t this the Zhang Yuanqi that he had been watching all morning on television!?Zhang Ye was dumbfounded about how she had managed to make the mistake of coming to his house. Only then did he realize that this was definitely the magical effect of the Cupid Sachet. Or else, how could this be a coincidence? The top S-list big shot in the country had managed to reach his home in a drunken stupor? Even novels weren\u2019t that ridiculous! However, with the sachet\u2019s effect, it had managed to happen!

Don\u2019t vomit on the floor!\u201dZhang Ye was in a panic and felt grossed out. He quickly dragged Zhang Yuanqi, who had just vomited, to the bathroom. Opening the toilet lid, the reeling Zhang Yuanqi vomited inside.As she vomited, Zhang Yuanqi\u2019s body slumped to the ground. Even her clothes had some vomit!Zhang Ye said loudly, \u201cBig Sis? Big Sis?\u201dZhang Yuanqi did not make a sound. She had fallen soundly asleep.Noticing the situation, Zhang Ye had no other way but to endure the grossness as he bent down and lifted up the dirty Zhang Yuanqi into the room.At this moment, the Cupid Sachet\u2019s effective time was up!Zhang Ye felt like crying. That was the five minutes he got with good luck with the females?He did not have the opportunity to complain. The smell in the room was terrible. Zhang Ye opened the windows to ventilate the room, as he pinched his nose and entered the bathroom to get a mop to wipe the floor. Then he cleaned the vomit in the bathroom.What should he do?Zhang Ye smacked himself in the forehead. He went to the landlady\u2019s house, but no matter how long he knocked on the door, no one came out. Rao Aimin had not seemed to be at home for the past few days. Finding a female neighbor? That wouldn\u2019t do. The rooms here were all rented. The people that lived here were a bit unruly; and what sort of status and fame did Zhang Yuanqi have? If this was made known, her popularity would definitely take a hit. The Heavenly Queen always appeared so graceful on television, so this was not to be made known to others!Returning home.Zhang Ye poured a glass of warm water and brought it to her, \u201cSis, drink some. Didn\u2019t you say you were thirsty? Here, open your mouth.\u201dIt was unknown if Zhang Yuanqi heard it as she moved her mouth.Zhang Ye took the opportunity to pour the water in. There was some water that spilled onto the bed. Hai.After suffering till 4 P.M., Zhang Ye managed to tidy up the room. Finally, the gross smell was gone. He was tired enough, as he fell asleep on the chair.One hour\u2026Three hours\u2026When Zhang Ye opened his eyes, the sky was already dark. Looking at his watch, it was already 10 P.M.!Ring, Ring, Ring. The Heavenly Queen\u2019s cellphone kept ringing. So it was her phone that had woken him up.Then Zhang Yuanqi\u2019s body also moved. She let out a very long tone as she rubbed her eyes. Suddenly she sat up, \u201cOh?\u201dZhang Ye immediately stood up while rubbing his eyes, \u201cYou have finally woken up!\u201dZhang Yuanqi\u2019s beautiful eyes looked coldly at the room\u2019s environment, before staring right into Zhang Ye\u2019s eyes. Her tone was blunt, \u201cWho are you?\u201dZhang Ye said, \u201cMy name is Zhang Ye, I\u2019m\u2026\u201dZhang Yuanqi abruptly interrupted, \u201cWhy am I here?\u201d Checking her clothes, she looked up, \u201cI\u2019m giving you a minute to explain!\u201dYour sister!To think you are angry?Zhang Ye said, \u201cBig Sis, shouldn\u2019t I be asking you this? I was in my room, minding my own business, but there you were using your key to stab my door. After you entered, you threw up on my floor. It took me two hours to clean up the mess!\u201dZhang Yuanqi frowned, \u201cWhat did I say in the afternoon to you?\u201d\u201cIt was all nonsense. Then you fell asleep.\u201d Zhang Ye said.Zhang Yuanqi asked again, \u201cDo you recognize me?\u201d\u201cZhang Yuanqi, right? I\u2019ve seen you on television.\u201d Zhang Ye said honestly.After about ten minutes, Zhang Ye managed to explain the situation to her. She had gone to the wrong house in her drunken stupor.\u201cWhat happened in the afternoon should only be known by you. Don\u2019t tell anyone, alright?\u201d Zhang Yuanqi said without explaining herself.Zhang Ye nodded, \u201cSure. I\u2019m not a gossipy person. Then, now you should\u2026\u201dZhang Yuanqi lowered her head and sniffed her clothes. Her eyebrows knitted and her expression turned sullen, \u201cGive me some female clothes; I\u2019ll leave once I change.\u201dZhang Ye said helplessly, \u201cWhy would there be female clothes in my house?\u201dZhang Yuanqi said impolitely, \u201cYou can buy it outside.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s almost 11 P.M. Which mall is still open?\u201d Zhang Ye rummaged through a closet and threw her a pair of pajamas. \u201cThis should get you through.\u201dZhang Yuanqi\u2019s eyebrows ticked.\u201cI\u2019m going to the bathroom. You change here.\u201d Zhang Ye went into the bathroom and hid himself there. After a few minutes, he asked, \u201cAre you done changing?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d A lukewarm response sounded.Zhang Ye came out and saw the clothes that she had taken off had been placed on the bed. \u201cShall I wash it for you?\u201dZhang Yuanqi said yes with a deadpan expression, \u201cLeave it in the dryer for a while to dry it faster.\u201dZhang Ye was thinking how much she did not stand on ceremony. \u201cI don\u2019t have a dryer, but I can try using a hairdryer.\u201d After he went through the motions of blowing on it with the hairdryer, he hung up her clothes.Coming out, her majesty Zhang Yuanqi was sitting on a small sofa, with her legs crossed in an elegant fashion. \u201cLittle Zhang, right? Get me something to eat. I\u2019m a bit hungry.\u201dZhang Ye, \u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cAlright?\u201d Zhang Yuanqi exhorted.Hai, forget it. She was, after all, a superstar!Zhang Ye took out the last egg in his house, \u201cI\u2019ll make a poached egg for you.\u201d This was a studio, so the kitchen was also in the house. Zhang Ye expertly turned on the fire, poured oil and sprinkled green onions. After the oil heated up, he cracked the egg into it. Knowing that the Heavenly Queen was waiting for her meal, Zhang Ye did not resist. He did it proudly. He was a man, after all. To be able to show off in front of a woman tends to give them a sense of accomplishment.The egg was done!Zhang Ye presented the plate, \u201cIt\u2019s done!\u201dZhang Yuanqi looked at the plate, \u201cAre you sure that you can cook?\u201d\u201cOf course. You sure are funny. If I don\u2019t know how to cook, who can?\u201d Zhang Ye said mockingly.Zhang Yuanqi asked, \u201cThen tell me why the color of the egg on the plate is this color? Also, why am I smelling a burnt smell?\u201dZhang Ye waved his finger with confidence and dragged the plate towards her. \u201cThat\u2019s because you don\u2019t understand. One glance and I know you can\u2019t cook. This is a new method of cooking. I did it on purpose. This is to fully express the flavor of the egg and to extract the fragrance of the egg to its fullest extent. The fire needs to be big, hence resulting in this color. Hai, you won\u2019t understand. Such a superstar like you must have never eaten authentic street-side chicken eggs!\u201dZhang Yuanqi looked at him silently.Zhang Ye coughed and finally threw the egg into the rubbish bin dejectedly, \u201cAlright, I messed up!\u201d How could this rascal know how to cook!?Zhang Yuanqi continued sending short messages with a deadpan expression.\u201cMy house only has instant noodles. I\u2019m also hungry. Do you want to eat it with me?\u201d Zhang Ye asked for her opinion.\u201c\u2026Do I have any other choices?\u201d Zhang Yuanqi said in a lukewarm manner.Hei, you sure are a big shot, to be picky with your meals! Zhang Ye rolled his eyes. He began boiling water to make the instant noodles. Each person had a bowl of noodles.\u201cI\u2019m not going to care about you. I\u2019ll eat first.\u201d Zhang Ye was extremely hungry.Zhang Yuanqi put down her cellphone and looked very unhappily at the bowl of instant noodles. Finally, she picked it up and frowned as she ate it.Zhang Ye was having a good time eating, \u201cIt\u2019s delicious, right?\u201dZhang Yuanqi, \u201c\u2026Have never eaten anything else?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not delicious? Uh, then you\u2019ll have to make do. Other than instant noodles, my house has nothing else.\u201d Zhang Ye said.\u201cWhen will my clothes dry?\u201d\u201cThe weather isn\u2019t very hot now. It will probably take four to five hours?\u201d\u201cThen I still need to live in your house tonight?\u201d\u201cYou can wear my pajamas and leave.\u201d\u201cWere you joking with me? I don\u2019t find it funny at all!\u201dZhang Ye also did not find it funny. What good luck with females? He had seen through it. There was all sorts of bad luck befalling him today. What good luck with females? Clearly an Empress Dowager had arrived! Thinking of the Zhang Yuanqi on television, she was so elegant and gentle. She was kind and warm to others. She remained patient and answered all the journalists who surrounded her. She was unusually friendly with her fans!But now, what had happened?Can someone tell me what had happened?Who is this person? Why has her personality changed by 180 degrees!?Zhang Ye\u2019s impression of the female goddess, Zhang Yuanqi, in his mind was shattered. My Heavenly Queen\u2019s personality can\u2019t be that bad! Something was definitely wrong!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Maybe she was working, as her face looked serious and sullen. She did not have any intention of speaking to Zhang Ye.She would kill the donkey the moment it left the millstone!You\u2019ve forgotten about this bro after you are full?Zhang Ye also knew that a distinguished person like her was busy, so he did not disturb her. He also wasn\u2019t emboldened enough to disturb her. Zhang Yuanqi was standing at the pinnacle of their country\u2019s entertainment industry, while Zhang Ye himself was just a small figure, who was a fledgling. He was not even considered a celebrity. He would, at most, be considered a public figure. The gap between them was heaven and earth. Zhang Ye knew this himself, so he was very respectful towards a senior.Switching on the computer, he began doing his own thing. He first checked his Weibo and was suddenly dumbfounded. Why were there so many forwards for one of his Weibo messages? Upon checking, he realized what had happened. The \u201cFlying Bird and Fish\u201d message that originally only had about 2,000-3,000 forwards back then? It wasn\u2019t that much. But now, this poem\u2019s forwards on Weibo had suddenly become more than 8,000. It had tripled! After being surprised for a while, Zhang Ye treated it as nothing. Back in his world, \u201cFlying Bird and Fish\u201d itself had more than a hundred million clicks on the internet. How many people did not see it? Hence, this tiny explosive increase was reasonable. A good poem could never be buried. As for the reason? Zhang Ye\u2019s analysis was that it was due to many things. \u201cGhost Blows Out the Light\u201d, fairy tale stories and his other poems. The number of people who knew of him was slowly increasing. So people would begin checking his other works, which created an entire increase in popularity for all of his works!\u201cGood poem!\u201d\u201cOnly now do I know about this poem today!\u201d\u201cWhy are there so many forwards? Let me see it first.\u201d\u201cClassic. Who is this Zhang Ye?\u201d\u201cYou have just seen it? It\u2019s already a poem from last month. This poem even saved a person\u2019s life. It is especially legendary!\u201dZhang Ye browsed through everyone\u2019s comments as he was lost in reverie. They were basically positive. As he was enjoying it, there was a sudden comment that appeared!Meng Dongguo.Verification: Beijing Writer\u2019s Association Deputy President. Poet. Author.He was a distinguished person with more than 3 million fans!Meng Dongguo had used his verified Weibo to openly question, \u201cI do not know why such things can become so popular. Just because there\u2019s a lot of people looking and commenting on it, that makes it a good poem? A legend? It saved a life? A poem\u2019s worth is based on its literary value; it does not depend on other stories or situations to add to its worth. I cannot see any literary value in this poem. All I see is moaning and drool. This can also be considered a modern poem? This is also called literature? Also, the author\u2019s \u2018A Generation\u2019, I would not comment on the poem\u2019s words, but why do I find the topic so twisted? A slightly past 20-year-old child commenting on a generation? This should be a term used by us, right? You are not grown up yet, and still have a long road ahead. You do not have the ability to see through your generation, so don\u2019t write such a poem to cause ridicule to yourself!\u201dSome people did not like that.\u201cIt can\u2019t be!? I think it\u2019s very good!\u201d\u201cSo what about youths? Youths can\u2019t write poems?\u201d\u201cWhat a joke! Just one sentence of \u2018you young people don\u2019t know anything\u2019 to negate all his worth? To think that you are the Deputy President of the Beijing Writer\u2019s Association?\u201dHowever, there were even more that joined the ranks of the doubters.A number of them were authors and poets of the Beijing Writer\u2019s Association. They were all verified accounts.Romance author Zheng Anbang commented, \u201cEven Vice President Meng has commented? Actually, I was not able to continue watching this, starting from a long time ago. This poem may be very popular now, but no matter how many times I see it, I can\u2019t figure out what is good about it!\u201dChildren\u2019s literature author Little Red Mushroom commented, \u201cZhang Ye\u2019s poem isn\u2019t bad, but it\u2019s only average. It does not deserve all this attention!\u201dA famous poet in Beijing, whose pseudonym was Big Thunder, said, \u201cWhat a mess! Complete bull****! What sort of poem is this? What are you trying to express with \u2018The Song of the Stormy Petrel\u2019? Do you think these are the old days? Even if you wanted to expression that period\u2019s rebellion and helplessness, how old are you? Do you know what the old society was like? Were you composing poems with your fantasy? How can there be any literary skill!? He is, at best, a temporary demagogue! Those who are following you, what\u2019s up with all of you? Do you even have any appreciation for art? I really wonder!\u201dSuddenly, five to six authors and poets began barraging Zhang Ye!Zhang Ye, who was in front of his computer, could not help but curse, \u201cWhat the f***! Are you monkeys backup that were invited? Where did you all pop up from? Did I provoke all of you!?\u201dZhang Yuanqi did not know what was happening as she came behind Zhang Ye. As she held her shoulders, her face was expressionless as she looked without blinking at his computer screen, \u201cWho are they scolding?\u201d\u201cScolding me.\u201d Zhang Ye said angrily.Zhang Yuanqi\u2019s eyelids twitched, \u201cMeng Dongguo? Beijing Writers\u2019 Association\u2019s Leader? This person has quite a bit of reputation in the industry, right? Then what about Little Red Mushroom? She was the one who wrote fairy tales, right? Big Thunder? I have seen his poems. He is not anything in the country, but he is still quite famous in Beijing.\u201d As the literature circle was encroaching into the entertainment industry, it was almost indivisible. As an S-list star in the industry, Zhang Yuanqi was quite aware of this. She was objective with their evaluations. Of course, only Zhang Yuanqi had the right to say this. If it was anyone else, no one would dare say who was not anything in the country. \u201cWhy are so many Beijing authors and poets scolding you? Are you very famous?\u201dZhang Ye was still upset, \u201cWhat do you mean, famous? I have only written a few poems. But who knows why they suddenly went crazy and started scolding me? My poems have problems? What an unfunny joke!\u201dUpon hearing this, Zhang Yuanqi stared at him, \u201cYou can compose poetry?\u201d\u201cOf course. Have you heard of \u2018Flying Bird and Fish\u2019?\u201d\u201c\u2026No.\u201d\u201cWhat about \u2018A Generation\u2019?\u201d\u201c\u2026.Never heard of it.\u201d\u201cAlright. Then, forget that I said anything!\u201dZhang Yuanqi seemed a little interested. She said in a deadpan manner, \u201cGo sit at the coffee table.\u201d There was only one chair in the house. With Zhang Ye standing up, Zhang Yuanqi sat down.Zhang Ye no longer had the energy to care about this, \u201cThey are bullies!\u201dZhang Yuanqi must have finished her work, as she began speaking to Zhang Ye, \u201cEverything has a cause. Go look at the first person who questioned you, Meng Dongguo\u2019s, Weibo.\u201dAfter checking, Zhang Ye was immediately enlightened. Meng Dongguo had published a few poems early in the month. But other than a few fans praising it, no one else had seen it. The forwarding count of a single poem from Zhang Ye was more than all his poems combined by ten times. \u201cHe saw that my results as a newcomer are better than his, so he wants to pull me down? What a grandson! What sort of people are they!?\u201dZhang Yuanqi was only watching the scene unfold before her as she remained silent.At this moment, the fans of Meng Dongguo and a few poets and authors had rushed to Zhang Ye\u2019s Weibo to curse at him. They did so indiscriminately!\u201cDemagogue!\u201d\u201cTo think you dare to publish such a beaten-up poem?\u201d\u201cEveryone, don\u2019t read this person\u2019s poem. The industry\u2019s experts have given their evaluation. This is not called literature. There is no value to it!\u201d\u201cIt can\u2019t be? It\u2019s quite good!\u201d\u201cDo you know, or do the experts know?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right; the Vice President of the Beijing Writer\u2019s Association has already said it\u2019s bad!\u201d\u201cI see. I thought it was such a good poem. You wasted my feelings!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right; I even recited Zhang Ye\u2019s poem to my children. I never expected it to not have any cultural value. Isn\u2019t this harming others? Harming me is fine, but don\u2019t mislead my children!\u201d\u201cZhang! Get lost from of the field of poetry!\u201d\u201cGet lost! There is no need for you!\u201d\u201cTo think I liked Zhang Ye\u2019s poems in the past. Hai, it\u2019s so disappointing!\u201dA few of Zhang Ye\u2019s original fans were steered by Meng Dongguo and a few authors and poets, as they began to complain!However, there were people who insisted on supporting Zhang Ye. However, soon, they drowned in those people\u2019s spit. They had no chance to talk!Zhang Ye felt sourness in his heart. He was also very distressed. That was the popularity that he had worked hard to obtain. But just because of their few words, it was being scattered away. Even those who supported Zhang Ye\u2019s poems were no longer that firm in their beliefs. After all, with so many professional Teachers and famous authors and poets collectively denying Zhang Ye\u2019s worth, people would all have second thoughts as to whether his poem was really good.Even his fans were scolding him. Zhang Ye\u2019s fists clenched tightly.Zhang Yuanqi said indifferently, \u201cThis is what the circle is like. You have to get used to others. If not\u2026\u201d\u201cThen what\u2019s the \u2018if not\u2019?\u201d Zhang Ye asked for advice.Zhang Yuanqi said coldly, \u201c\u2026If not, make others get used to you.\u201dZhang Ye thought for a while and, after digesting Zhang Yuanqi\u2019s words, he was no longer angry. Seeing the cursing or disappointed fans, Zhang Ye posted a message on Weibo.It was a response!A response from one to all!Zhang Yuanqi was by his side, reading. As she saw Zhang Ye type one word after another, her gaze changed for the first time. There was a brilliance in her eyes!Zhang Ye had written this.\u201cSee me, or not. There will I stay, no sorrow, nor joy.\u201d\u201cMiss me, or not. There will affection lay, no immersion, nor dispersion.\u201d\u201cLove me, or not. There will love remain, no more, nor less.\u201d\u201cFollow me, or not. In your hand is mine, no discarding, nor departure.\u201d\u201cCome to me, or give me your heart to dwell in.\u201d\u201cLove with serenity. Rejoice in silence.\u201dThis was an old poem. Why so? Because according to the poem\u2019s age, it was actually quite old in Zhang Ye\u2019s world. It was not very famous at all until the movie, \u201cIf You Are the One 2\u201d was released. It then became famous. Even the drama, \u201cPalace\u201d had used it as lyrics for its ending song. Later on, someone said that this poem was composed byTsangyang Gyatso. Actually it wasn\u2019t. There was even a copyright lawsuit. The original author of the poem was Tashi Lam, Dodo? The original name of the poem was \u201cThe Silence of Vadjra Guru Pema\u201d and also \u201cSee Me or Not\u201d.Some people might question whether a love poem like this would be suitable in this situation.It was precisely that many people were not sure. This poem was not a love poem at all. It had nothing to do with love. This poem\u2019s inspiration came from his world\u2019s\u00a0Guru Rinpoche\u2018s famous words, \u201cI have never abandoned people who believed in me, or even those who did not believe in me. Although they will not see me, my children will forever be protected by my compassion.\u201d This poem expressed the Guru\u2019s neither clinging, nor abandoning love for his disciples. It had nothing to do with romantic love.It was perfectly apt for Zhang Ye to use it as a response!Maybe he was not as noble as the original authors, but it currently represented his feelings!Regardless of people who like me staying or leaving me.I will be right here, neither clinging, nor abandoning, neither sad, nor happy!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, Teacher Zhang Ye has made me completely fall in love with literature and art, like poems. I do not know if those people cursing at Teacher Zhang Ye behind their keyboards or those so-called professional authors have any eyes! All of you are at least authoritative literature authors in Beijing. One of you is even some association\u2019s Vice President, so don\u2019t make us look down on you, alright? Even a layman like me can see how good Teacher Zhang Ye\u2019s poems are. Yet you despise it? Just because he is young? Is age a reason?

Look at the comments. Look at the search hits of every poem of Teacher Zhang\u2019s, as well as the clicks in any major discussion forum. The eyes of the masses are bright. The market has already made its judgment. I\u2019m curious; why would some people be jealous of Teacher Zhang\u2019s results? Must they jump out and say some words to stomp on him? Using Teacher Zhang\u2019s words, why did you give up treatment?\u201dWith Zhang Ye taking the lead, his fans also followed him to counterattack.The Beijing poet, Big Thunder, also commented, \u201cDo you know literature, or do we know literature? Just now, that love poem\u2026 Does anyone know what he is saying? Do you know? Don\u2019t pretend to know if you don\u2019t understand! Literature is literature! Art is art! They are not things used to fool others!\u201dZhangYeNumber1Fan came out. Ever since the Weibo war of words, this hardcore fan of Zhang Ye would not hesitate to stand up whenever Zhang Ye faced troubles. He retorted, \u201cThen can I ask Teacher Big Thunder above, \u2018what is art?\u2019 Do you not know? Well, is art something that depends on what you say? Then what are we commoners for? Then what\u2019s the point of us poetry lovers? Literary works are things only you can enjoy? What a joke! To be a poet at such a level? You aren\u2019t even a hundredth of Teacher Zhang Ye\u2019s level! A literary work is for the commoners to see it and for them to resonate with it. They would be moved; they would have feelings. That is why Teacher Zhang\u2019s poem is so popular. This is the literary judgment by us commoners!\u201dThere were also capable people on Weibo.For example, a person named HDUSOS09 said, \u201cLet me first declare that I am neutral. I do not support either side. I\u2019ve been reading all day and have seen Zhang Ye\u2019s poem. I may be lacking in knowledge, but let me correct Teacher Big Thunder\u2019s evaluation. I think it is quite biased. Love poem? I do not think it is a love poem. Although the poem\u2019s text has the word affection, and even the ending has the word love, that is just something literal. If you can properly understand this poem, you will discover that this is a poem that is full of compassion. How can a person write about romantic love with a compassionate heart? That\u2019s why my analysis is that Teacher Zhang Ye had written this poem to his fans. No, actually, it should be said that he wrote this poem to everyone in this world!\u201d\u201cPlease continue.\u201d\u201cA capable person has come; please continue your analysis.\u201d\u201cWaiting for the capable person to analyze this poem I couldn\u2019t understand!\u201dA lot of comments came in below. Many of them did not understand what Zhang Ye wanted to express, but nonetheless they felt that the poem was especially carefree!HDUSOS09 continued, \u201cIt is my personal opinion, but I think that Teacher Zhang Ye wanted to express love to the common person. He knew his work would not be accepted by everyone. Whether they scold him or dislike him, he will not be affected. He only wants to use his works to move people, touch people, help people. Which is why whether they see or not see him, he is neither sad, nor happy. Whether they follow or unfollow him, he will not discard or depart from them. Being a normal person, Teacher Zhang Ye might not be able to reach this state. But as a poet, he needs to have such an attitude. Yeah, this is what I see. I might not be correct, but this poem is so memorable and worth rereading; every sentence feels like it can make people think and reflect upon on it for a long time!\u201d\u201cWell said!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s informative!\u201d\u201cSo that\u2019s what it means! Thank you for the expert dissection!\u201dHDUSOS09 replied, \u201cIt not really a dissection; the poem is really deep, so even I don\u2019t have the ability to analyze it. It is just my personal opinion. Nevertheless, the truth has been proven; who says Teacher Zhang Ye does not know how to write poems? Who says Teacher Zhang Ye\u2019s poems are not works of literature or art? Don\u2019t take others as fools! I am neither an author, nor poet, but I\u2019m still considered a literary person. If i dare to say it today, just based on Teacher Zhang Ye\u2019s \u2018See Me or Not\u2019 poem, there should be a place for Teacher Zhang in the nation\u2019s literary circle! No one can deny the quality of his art!\u201d\u201cI sincerely apologize. Listening to those dog s*** Beijing Writers\u2019 Association\u2019s Vice President and a few vocal authors, I thought they were correct. It made me post and criticize Teacher Zhang Ye. I\u2019m so godd*mn stupid; why did I believe them at all! What professionals? In the future, I won\u2019t listen to any professional opinions! I will trust in my own judgement! Teacher Zhang\u2019s poems must be good poems! They moved me so many times!\u201d\u201cI apologize, too. I was really confused just now!\u201d\u201cYeah. Who still f***ing dares to say Teacher Zhang Ye doesn\u2019t know how to write poems?\u201dZhang Ye\u2019s fans who left came back again and made a scene. Zhang Ye proved his worth and, at the same time, responded back at those unscrupulous people!But there were still scoldings.\u201cBull****!\u201d\u201cHe only knows how to put on an act!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! You said it so amazingly! It was too exaggerated!\u201d\u201cHow come I didn\u2019t see anything good about the poem? You guys are just bragging about Zhang Ye! How much did he pay you all? A dollar for a comment? You guys are so supportive with the bragging!\u201d\u201cThe professionals have stated their case and yet you all are unhappy?\u201dZhangYeNumber1Fan could not longer stand it, \u201cComrades, when logic no longer works, what do we do?\u201dZhangYeNumber1Fan seemed to have a good reputation and network on the internet. When he appeared, lots of trolls would respond to his callings. They had responded earlier, but were overwhelmed by the fans of those poets and authors. There were too many of them and the trolls were unable to do much. Now was the time to fight back!\u201cIf logic doesn\u2019t work, then there\u2019s nothing to talk about anymore!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s curse! Crash their Weibo!\u201d\u201cWhen did our troll army ever need to use logic?\u201d\u201cHahaha. Logic was never our strong point!\u201d\u201cAll the discussion earlier\u2026 I did not understand one bit of it. Even the poem, I did not understand it. But so what! I just godd*mn support Teacher Zhang Ye!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s attack, bros!\u201d\u201cBuy watches for all of them!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s time for us to attack our enemies again!\u201d\u201cMy large saber is again again again unable to endure the thirst!\u201d\u201cQuickly gather the forces; there\u2019s nothing better than fighting our foes together with Teacher Zhang!\u201dZhang Ye\u2019s troll army once again embarked on a bloody battle with their enemies. This group of people with nothing to do, who could find fault with anything, were bloodthirsty. Nothing could stop them. To them, this was the joy of living.The opponents\u2019 fans were awed by Zhang Ye\u2019s \u201cSee Me or Not\u201d. Some of them even quietly logged off. They knew that they were behaving vexatiously earlier. A person who could write such an awesome modern poem, how could he not know how to write poems? But many of them still supported the teachers of the literary circle. To them, Meng Dongguo and the others were the seniors, Big Thunder and the others were the real professionals on poems. Since they rejected Zhang Ye\u2019s literary upbringing, then they must be right!Two sides cursed each other, but there was no clear outcome.Close to 12 midnight, most people had logged off. After both sides came to a standstill, Zhang Ye\u2019s modified poems were scheduled for an appearance!There was \u201cThe Song of the Stormy Petrel\u201d.There was \u201cFlying Bird and Fish\u201d.There was also \u201cA Generation\u201d.Everyone was more than happy with Zhang Ye\u2019s modified poems. This was something started by Zhang Ye, because no other writer had ever modified their own works for arguing!\u201cProposing to me, or not. There will I stay, no sorrow, nor joy\u2026\u201d\u201cMarry me, or not. There will your mom always stay, sometimes sorrow, sometimes joy\u2026\u201dIn the blink of an eye, Zhang Ye\u2019s \u201cSee Me or Not\u201d Weibo message had been forwarded more than 2,000 times. There were more than 10,000 comments. Regardless of it being questioned, this poem had gone viral!\u201cWhere\u2019s Teacher Zhang?\u201d\u201cOur standards are limited. Wishing for Teacher Zhang\u2019s modifications!\u201d\u201cHahaha, that\u2019s right. Every time Teacher Zhang modifies his own poems, he does it so well!\u201dSeeing this, Zhang Ye heeded their summons and came forward. Again, he displayed his self-mocking spirit and posted a new Weibo message.\u201cFan me, or not. There will I stay, no sorrow, nor joy.\u201d\u201c(Thread) Bumping me, or not. There will people stay, no coming, nor going.\u201d\u201cReply me, or not. There will the thread stay, no increase, nor decrease;\u201d\u201cSee me, or not. There my poem stays in your Weibo, no discarding, nor departure;\u201d\u201cCome to my Weibo, or let me go to your Weibo. Forwarding with serenity. Comment that\u2019s all!\u201dThis was one of the modifications of \u201cSee Me or Not\u201d in Zhang Ye\u2019s world. Zhang Ye felt that this was most appropriate to obtain fans, so he sent it out.When everyone saw this, they were in stitches!\u201cI\u2019ve already fan-ed!\u201d\u201cMust fan!\u201d\u201cTeacher Zhang is too cute!\u201d\u201cI love you, Teacher Zhang!\u201d\u201cSo well-written! Hilarious!\u201d\u201cTeacher Zhang can always spare no effort to publicize himself in the best method! And he doesn\u2019t even show a trace of that!\u201d\u201cThe critical thing is his magnanimity. Look at what sort of spirit Teacher Zhang has! He can make jokes and mingle with us. Look at all those Beijing literature bunch of so-called authors and poets. All of them are as if they are all so high and mighty!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d\u201cAs expected of Teacher Zhang to be cute!\u201d\u201cTeacher Zhang is the greatest poet in my heart!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He had forgotten about the Heavenly Queen in his home and casually turned on the radio to listen to his broadcast, \u201cLate-night Ghost Stories\u201d.\u201cHello, everyone. I am Zhang Ye. Today\u2019s story\u2026\u2026\u201dZhang Yuanqi who was sitting on the chair heard it, \u201cYou are a radio host?\u201dZhang Ye, suddenly remembering that there was someone around, turned his head, \u201cAh, yes. This is my program; I have another program called \u201cOld and Young Story Club\u201d that plays in the afternoon. You can listen to it when you have time\u2026\u201d He passionately introduced his program.Zhang Yuanqi replied straightforwardly, \u201cI\u2019m not free to listen.\u201dZhang Ye replied, \u201cCan you be more tactful?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t do it.\u201d Zhang Yuanqi replied stiffly.Zhang Ye was already used to her indifference and smiled bitterly, \u201cI know that you are the Heavenly Queen and you are busy with work. But on account of me letting you stay the night, cooking for you and washing your clothes, could you just say \u2018I will listen to it when I\u2019m free\u2019? I will feel better, even if I know you didn\u2019t mean it.\u201dZhang Yuanqi still insisted, \u201cI\u2019m not free!\u201dZhang Ye was no longer able to communicate with her. He turned down the volume of the radio, \u201cGo get some sleep? The clothes will only be dry tomorrow morning. I will make do with the chair. I\u2019ve had enough sleep in the afternoon anyway, so I\u2019m not sleepy.\u201d Regardless of Zhang Yuanqi\u2019s temperament, Zhang Ye was still a gentleman.Zhang Yuanqi nodded and went straight to bed.Zhang Ye also went to the bedside to retrieve a pillow from it. He thought that it would at least make his time on the chair more comfortable.But Zhang Yuanqi frowned and said, \u201cThe pillow stays.\u201dZhang Ye blinked \u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m used to having two pillows; one is too low.\u201d Zhang Yuanqi justifiably took the pillow from him and put it at the back of her head.Zhang Ye, \u201c\u2026\u201dThis is my home, big sister!Couldn\u2019t you be more gracious? Couldn\u2019t you?Zhang Ye hesitated for a long time, but couldn\u2019t bear to grab the pillow away from a woman. He could only bear with the hard chair, while listening to his program.\u201cLower the volume!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Oh, okay.\u201d\u201cThere are mosquitoes in your home; switch on the lights and kill them.\u201d\u201cBig Sis, could you give me a break?\u201d\u201cThe mosquitoes will keep me awake. Quick, it\u2019s just at the edge of the bed!\u201dZhang Ye thought to himself that he spent the whole day doing nothing but taking care of this Empress Dowager. The Cupid Sachet gave him five minutes of ambiguous feelings, but after that, all he had was suffering? If he got the item again in the Lottery, he would still have to consider whether to use it again! This time, he had met Zhang Yuanqi. What if he met someone worse the next time; how could he survive!?Middle of the night.The radio broadcast had ended and the house was quiet.Zhang Ye was wide awake. There was a beautiful woman sleeping in his bed of a few months. In this proximity, it would be a wonder if he could sleep. He looked out the window at the moon. Tomorrow\u2026\u2026 Strictly speaking, today was Mid-Autumn\u2019s day. The moon was really full. He glanced under the moonlight and realized that Zhang Yuanqi was also awake. Was she admiring the moon as well?\u201cTeacher Zhang?\u201d Zhang Ye carefully said.Zhang Yuanqi responded with her usual unfriendly tone, \u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYou are not asleep, too? It\u2019s nothing.. just that it is Mid-Autumn\u2019s day; I would like to wish you a happy Mid-Autumn\u2019s day.\u201d Zhang Ye pondered a little, \u201cThanks for today. You said something that enlightened me greatly; either I get used to people, or people get used to me. I can\u2019t do the former; that\u2019s not my temperament. I will work hard towards the.. latter.\u201dAlthough Zhang Ye had been complaining about Zhang Yuanqi\u2019s personality, never had he once looked down on her. She was already at the top and was very experienced and knowledgeable. Just a few words from her today became valuable help to Zhang Ye. Besides, her personality was not even really a problem!She was all smiles and endearing in front of others?Once alone, she revealed her nature that was cold and distant?Or to put it in another way, Zhang Yuanqi was a real professional. She could differentiate between work and personal life. When she was friendly and polite, it was for work, in order to gain more fans and work partners, as well as to let more people like her, so that she could have a smooth career. What is a professional? This is a professional! Zhang Ye did not know how to differentiate like this. His life and his job were one and the same. One-minded, stubborn; to put it nicely, it\u2019s called personality. But to switch around the perspective, this sort of style may not suit Zhang Ye\u2019s career!Zhang Yuanqi didn\u2019t look at him, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to thank me; I just blurted it out.\u201dZhang Ye replied seriously, \u201cI still have to thank you anyway. You gave me the fighting spirit I needed. I want to slowly climb my way up. I will climb my way up to your position. Even if others scold or hate me, it will not matter. I will let people get used to me.\u201dZhang Yuanqi finally looked at him, \u201cYou want to be in the entertainment industry?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Zhang Ye coughed, \u201cThis has always been my ambition.\u201dZhang Yuanqi laughed coldly, \u201cWhat is so good about where I am? Once you are famous, everyone knows you. Wherever you go, people\u2019s eyes are always on you. You will be observed under a microscope; there will be no privacy. Today was my long awaited rest day, but it wasn\u2019t really my rest day. It\u2019s my day to break off all communications with the outside world. At my position, there\u2019s no longer such a thing as rest days. You want a break? I can\u2019t answer any calls, nor contact my manager. Otherwise, there will be a load of appointments that I need to attend. To relax for a day is wishful thinking. Do you know how long I have not been able to enjoy myself, being able to go drinking and viewing the moon? At least a year!\u201dZhang Ye replied, \u201cHow can that be? No rest days?\u201dZhang Yuanqi spoke with a sunken expression, \u201cYou should feel lucky; not many people know this side of me. Even my friends, my manager and my assistant\u2026 All of them only know the pleasant side of me. They think I am good-natured and easygoing. What\u2019s so easygoing about me? My temper has been bad since I was young. I only don\u2019t show it to outsiders. It\u2019s because I started off as a child star. As I became an artist since I was young, I cannot let down my fans. This kind of pressure is not something that you can understand now, but you will in the future. Now, there are only two places where I can be myself; one is my parents\u2019 house, the other.. is your house.\u201dZhang Ye was very flattered, \u201cPlease, don\u2019t worry; I will keep it a secret!\u201d\u201cSigh. Why did I share so much with you? I\u2019m still a little drunk, so I\u2019m talking a lot.\u201d Zhang Yuanqi rubbed her temple, perhaps still a little dizzy. \u201cAlso, here\u2019s one more piece of advice. Your image and height are not suitable for the entertainment industry. You won\u2019t become popular.\u201dZhang Ye said, \u201cYou are too damn direct!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s only the truth.\u201d Zhang Yuanqi said, \u201cThe entertainment industry does not suit you.\u201dZhang Ye shook his head, \u201cI know I am not suitable, but i want to give it a shot. The dark night gave me black eyes, but I have to use them to seek the light.\u201d\u201cThis is a poem?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s \u2018A Generation\u2019, which was written by me.\u201d\u201cRecite your other poems to me.\u201d\u201cSure. Let\u2019s start with \u201cFlying Bird and Fish\u201d. The furthest distance in the world is not\u2026.\u2026At some point in time, Zhang Ye fell asleep. When he opened his eyes again, it was already morning. The bed was empty as well, with no signs of Zhang Yuanqi around.Where\u2019s the Heavenly Queen?Where\u2019s the Empress Dowager?Zhang Ye shouted twice, \u201cTeacher Zhang? Teacher Zhang?\u201dShe was not in the bathroom either. At last, he found a note on the table. Written on it neatly was the handwriting of a woman: I\u2019ve saved your phone number; the same goes for your unit number. I\u2019ve forgotten yesterday\u2019s incident; I guess you have, too.Phone number?Unit number?Why does it feel like a threat!Zhang Ye took his phone and checked. As expected, ten minutes ago, there was a call to an unfamiliar number. Apparently, this was Zhang Yuanqi\u2019s contact number. She had used Zhang Ye\u2019s phone to call herself, so that she could find out his number. Zhang Ye was delighted, and so saved Zhang Yuanqi\u2019s number as well. This was the Heavenly Queen\u2019s contact information. Most people would only be able to contact her manager or her assistant; how would they ever be able to get ahold of the Heavenly Queen\u2019s personal contact information?Eh?Dialled ten minutes ago?That meant the Empress Dowager hadn\u2019t gotten too far?Zhang Ye drew aside the curtains and looked downstairs. Not to mention the coincidence, but he really saw the back of Zhang Yuanqi leaving. As he opened the windows, her high heels could be faintly heard. She had just walked out from the staircase landing.\u201cAh!\u201d\u201cThat is\u2026..\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s Zhang Yuanqi?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s her. It\u2019s really Big Sister Yuanqi!\u201d\u201cOh, my God! Who did I just see? Who did i just see?\u201d\u201cZhang Yuanqi is here! The Heavenly Queen is here! Everyone, come and see!\u201dThe people were very familiar with with Zhang Yuanqi. She appeared on TV shows, in movies and sang music. Her classic works were uncountable. She was one of those top S-list superstars; she was more famous than her works by a mile. Thus, even her shades and face mask could do little to hide her identity!In the small district, there were many people going to work. Even during Mid-Autumn\u2019s day, there were still people who put in work hours. There were also students who were out for morning practice. When they heard the commotion, everyone gathered around, causing quite a ruckus!A female student went excitedly, \u201cCould I have an autograph?\u201dZhang Yuanqi asked smilingly. \u201cSure. What is your name?\u201dThe female student was so excited that she almost couldn\u2019t speak, \u201cMe? I\u2019m called Wang Ying!\u201d\u201cOkay. Wishing Wang Ying well in her studies and good health.\u201d Zhang Yuanqi wrote as she spoke.The female student didn\u2019t expect that she would have gotten her autograph; furthermore, she had the blessings from the Heavenly Queen. She was so excited that she screamed and lost control of herself!\u201cI want it, too. I want it too!\u201d\u201cCould we get a photograph together?\u201d\u201cSister Yuanqi, I love you so much! Everyone in my family are your fans!\u201dZhang Yuanqi unconditionally smiled with gentleness, \u201cThank you for your support and thank your family for their support, too. Okay, one by one. Everyone don\u2019t rush. Haha.\u201d\u201cWe aren\u2019t delaying you, are we?\u201d a middle-aged person who wanted a photograph together said.Zhang Yuanqi smiled, \u201cYou aren\u2019t delaying me. Even if it\u2019s a delay, it is fine. Satisfying my fans is the most important thing to me; this is my top priority.\u201d\u201cThank you! Thank you!\u201d said the middle-aged person, who was melted by the Heavenly Queen\u2019s smile.After 20 minutes, Zhang Yuanqi finally could move off.\u201cIt\u2019s great!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve gotten a snapshot together!\u201d\u201cTeacher Zhang is well-known for being approachable; it\u2019s true!\u201d\u201cCorrect, correct. In the entertainment industry, who doesn\u2019t know that Zhang Yuanqi is the one who puts on the least airs! She is especially good to people! And she also gets along very well with other stars! Otherwise, why would everyone, regardless of their ages, address her as \u2018Big Sister Zhang\u2019? She has never lost her temper with anyone! She is especially gentle and kind! Ah, ah! Too beautiful! Sister Zhang is too beautiful! She\u2019s prettier than on TV!\u201dSeeing the Empress Dowager treating her fans in a friendly manner, listening to the fans\u2019 impression of Zhang Yuanqi, Zhang Ye became at a loss for words.She was a different person in different situations?This would require some skills!If not, how could Zhang Yuanqi manage to get several top acting awards! Other people would not be able to pull this off!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was a bit misty.Zhang Ye came to the unit and before he entered, his phone rang. It was his mother.\u201cSon.\u201d\u201cOh, mom.\u201d\u201cAre you coming home for Mid-Autumn\u2019s Day?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t go back; I have to work overtime.\u201d\u201cOvertime on a holiday? You should be free at night then?\u201d\u201cI should be free tonight. I will go back once I have knocked off.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t come back to Cai Shi Kou; go directly to your grandmother\u2019s place. The relatives will all be there. They have heard that you have gained fame; your younger sisters (cousins) are all nagging to see you.\u201d\u201cOkay. Then, I will try to go early.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t forget; my face will depend on you tonight!\u201d\u201cWhat face? They are all relatives. Are you bragging about me again?\u201d\u201cAnyhow, just buy more things and bring them over. Don\u2019t be too thrifty; buy the expensive ones. You are now a public figure; don\u2019t go throwing my face. Okay, I\u2019m hanging up.\u201dDu Du Du; the line was disengaged.Zhang Ye smiled bitterly. His mom didn\u2019t have any other bad points. The only big feature was that she liked to brag. Yes, Zhang Ye admitted that he had inherited this from his mother. But he had never felt this was a bad point! Many examples in his world would validate this.Is bragging wrong? No!Do you know how Bill Gates became the richest person in the world?Do you know how Li Na became the tennis world champion?Do you know how Liu Xiang broke the world record in the hurdles event?Not many people should know about this! What is the reason? Haha, the reason is they\u2026\u2026 Alright, all of these events have nothing to do with each other. Let\u2019s change the topic!Not many people had arrived at the office.Zhang Ye didn\u2019t look around as he walked in. Suddenly, a voice appeared from behind.It was Big Sis Zhou. She smiled, \u201cGreet me, or not. There will I stay, no sorrow, nor joy.\u201dZhang Ye quickly smiled and turn back to look at her, \u201cBig Sister Zhou, good morning. I\u2019m sorry. The flowers on your desk were blocking you; I did not notice you were here.\u201dBig Sis Zhou said proudly, \u201cHow was it, Little Zhang? I used your poem correctly?\u201dZhang Ye embarrassedly said, \u201cYou saw Weibo last night?\u201d\u201cOf course, I saw it. I followed your Weibo last night. I did not expect that after I followed it, the party had also started. It caused me to fall asleep after 12 last night. You didn\u2019t follow me, right? I even forwarded your new poem.\u201d As she spoke, she felt some injustice for him, \u201cIgnore those people from the Writers\u2019 Association. If you don\u2019t know what art is and can\u2019t write poems, then no one in the world can write poems. Big Sis supports you. Don\u2019t take it to heart.\u201dZhang Ye smiled, \u201cThank you, Big Sis Zhou.\u201dOutside, people began streaming in for their overtime.\u201cEh, Teacher Little Zhang, you\u2019ve come? Why did you get into a pinch with people yesterday?\u201d\u201cVice President Meng is the Leader of the Beijing Writers\u2019 Association. How did you offend him?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. I saw it yesterday, too. Teacher Little Zhang, if I had any say, you shouldn\u2019t have posted your last poem. Those are the Writers\u2019 Association\u2019s Leaders and seniors. If you really offend them, how are you to enter the Writers\u2019 Association in the future? I think that it is best to leave some leeway. Hai, but those people are also too much. Why did they reprimand you for no reason? Even if your poems aren\u2019t comparable to them as seniors, how old are you? You are still young. They also can\u2019t say that your poems have no literary value. That\u2019s too damaging. I think your poem is still acceptable and isn\u2019t as bad as they say.\u201d\u201cSis Liu, what did you say? You say Teacher Little Zhang\u2019s poem is acceptable? I think you have been misled by that group of people; Teacher Little Zhang has so much talent!\u201dSeveral sisters and aunties began an exchange of difference in opinions.Until work starts at 9 A.M., the topic was hotly discussed amongst everyone.Tian Bin also had an interest in the battle on Weibo last night. He interrupted to ask, \u201cSis Zhou, what sort of person is Vice-President Meng like? Those old timers are very experienced. Big Thunder and a few other poets, all of them are professionals. If they said so, then it must mean they criticized it according to their literary learnings. How can we judge, since we are not as knowledgeable as them? It\u2019s not that I am stepping on Teacher Zhang Ye. But like the old comrades of the Writers\u2019 Association said, there are many issues. After reading it, I also feel some doubts.\u201dBig Sister Zhou looked at Tian Bin, \u201cThen why don\u2019t you create a poem for me to listen to?\u201dTian Bin replied, \u201cI don\u2019t have such capabilities, but I still have some basic judgment skills.\u201d He turned around towards Jia Yan, \u201cTeacher Little Jia, what do you think?\u201dJia Yan gave some thought and said, \u201cTeacher Zhang\u2019s poems definitely cannot compare with those seniors. As for whether it has any literary value, it\u2019s not my place to make an evaluation.\u201dWhat they said was also heard by Zhang Ye.When Zhang Ye used two poems to save a life on Wang Xiaomei\u2019s live broadcast, the office and even everyone in the Beijing Radio Station had completely acknowledged his talent and poem. They had all said that it was good, with no one denying it. But now, the Writers\u2019 Association with Meng Dongguo as the head had openly questioned and denied Zhang Ye\u2019s poems publicly. As such, his colleagues were now not unified in their beliefs. Some said they were good, while others said they were bad. Even more were uncertain and confused. Sometimes, the authoritative opinions of experts were very damaging and also affected many.How was one to change the situation?How was one to eliminate the public\u2019s doubts?There was no other way. As long as Zhang Ye\u2019s qualifications were weaker than Meng Dongguo and company\u2019s, then he was not able to turn the tide. He would only be repressed by their words. Unless\u2026 Unless Zhang Ye used his absolute talent and strength to trample on Meng Dongguo and company at a specific place and time. Otherwise, the doubts by people would forever linger on. So what if he responded yesterday? So what if the poem was well-written yesterday? The Writers\u2019 Association said that it wasn\u2019t good! They said that he did not know art! They said that he did not know literature! Just them moving their lips was enough to make you be helpless! This was the deceptive power of authority and prerogative. Many commoners did not understand this, so they only believed what the experts said!Today, there was no announcement of the listenership ratings, as there were a lot of things happening in the station.Zhang Ye did not care what everyone said. He got up to get his recording done, \u201cXiaofang, help me reserve a recording studio. Quickly, or it will be too late.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Assistant Xiaofang answered and immediately went to arrange it. However, she returned a few minutes later, \u201cTeacher Zhang, the station has informed me that our Literature Channel\u2019s programs from noon to 2 P.M. have all been canceled. There\u2019s no need to record. Apparently, the News and Music Channels will also be broadcasting the Mid-Autumn Poetry Meet!\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been cancelled?\u201d\u201cMid-Autumn Poetry Meet? This is the thing that the Leader has been busy with over the past few days?\u201dA few moments later, Zhao Guozhou entered, \u201cEveryone, quiet down. Today\u2019s broadcast has some last-minute changes. Listen for a while. From 12 noon, the seventh Mid-Autumn Poetry Meet that was held in conjunction with the Beijing Writers\u2019 Association and our radio station will begin. Our Literature Channel will also join in for the live broadcast. This Poetry Meet will be different from the last one done by the Jinshi Radio Station. There will be a composing and voting segment. We have invited the Education Ministry\u2019s Leader and the Vice President of the Beijing Writers\u2019 Association and about a dozen of its members. The exact name list has not been confirmed, but there will definitely be quite a few people. As the association\u2019s Teachers\u2019 creations will be poems related to the Mid-Autumn Festival, the listeners behind the radio can also compose and post them on our website\u2019s comment section. Later on, the listeners\u2019 votes will decide on the top three. So we have added some competitive elements to make the program more interesting.\u201dCompose poetry?Then Meng Dongguo and those people from the Writers\u2019 Association would also come?Zhang Ye chuckled upon hearing this. \u201cHe who has one enemy will meet him everywhere.\u201d Yesterday, he had just been scolded by him on the internet. And today they would be meeting?Would Big Thunder come?Would Little Red Mushroom come?In fact, Zhang Ye actually looked forward to seeing them in the station!Zhao Guozhou exhorted, \u201cSo put down everything in your hands. Today, everything will have the Mid-Autumn Poetry Meet as its focus. Everyone, go help out. The live broadcast venue will be in the auditorium. This is the first time that we are using such a large live broadcast venue. The equipment has not been fully tuned, so those I call out will follow me later and help out. Right. As it was not easy inviting a large audience, everyone should take an early lunch later. The cafeteria will hand out lunch early at 10.30 A.M. At noon, everyone will take their seats in the auditorium.After calling out some names, Zhao Guozhou brought four young lads with him to the auditorium.Big Sis Zhou suddenly said, \u201cTeacher Little Zhang, will you be participating in the Mid-Autumn Poetry Meet? Writing poetry is one of your strengths. They said that you don\u2019t understand literature? Then show it to them!\u201dAnother Big Sis said, \u201cCome on. Little Zhang did not make any early preparations and just got notified. Those Teachers must have been informed a long time ago. They would have foolproof preparations. How can Little Zhang compete with them? It\u2019s better that he not embarrass himself.\u201dAn auntie in charge of copyright said, \u201cLittle Zhou, don\u2019t let them give you bad ideas. Little Zhang\u2019s poems are good, but that\u2019s only to us. Those people from the Writers\u2019 Association are professionals. Some of them are poets and famous artists; how is he to compete with them?\u201d In a layperson\u2019s heart, the work is not actually important. Reputation and prestige is what they first look at. Zhang Ye is just a newcomer and has never entered the Writers\u2019 Association, so people will subconsciously identify Zhang Ye\u2019s works as inferior.There were all sorts of differing opinions.Later, as there wasn\u2019t much time left, everyone went to the cafeteria for an early meal.Zhang Ye was actually in a dilemma. For the Mid-Autumn Poetry Meet, Meng Dongguo, Big Thunder and company would most likely be participating. Wasn\u2019t this the best time to turn the tide for himself? Wasn\u2019t this the best moment to prove himself? But how was he to participate in it? It could be seen from the format of the poetry contest. Although the listeners could participate by publishing their creations, that was just in text form. But the people from the Writers\u2019 Association would be reciting their works live. Hence, the top three had already been decided by the station to be one of those from the Writers\u2019 Association. They had already given them a huge advantage!Go mess things up?Stab them in their backs?Hence, even if Zhang Ye wanted to go on, he did not know if the radio station\u2019s management and the people from the Beijing Writers\u2019 Association would let him go on the show.Forget it. We\u2019ll see how it goes. As for the poem regarding the Mid-Autumn Festival? Zhang Ye had not thought of it yet. It was not that his brain was void of works, but it was.. filled with too many!He wasn\u2019t prepared?Did he even need to prepare?Mid-Autumn Festival poems? Not to brag, but Zhang Ye would probably not be able to finish reciting them, even if given a day and a night!The Mid-Autumn Festival was not a modern day festival. It had a long history that dated back to ancient times, so there was a countless number of poems relating to the Mid-Autumn Festival. In this world, history did not have many changes. There were the same old dynasties and emperors, just like in Zhang Ye\u2019s memories. As such, history would not cause too many changes. The game ring probably could not change the historical background, or else society might no longer have such a social structure. It would affect everything.However, many famous cultural works and famous historical figures did not exist!Li Bai?Du Fu?Wang Wei?None of them existed!They were all replaced by others!This world\u2019s ancient master poets were people Zhang Ye had never ever heard of. For example, there was Haoran, or Chen Yiqian, or Meng Fan. Zhang Ye had also never heard of any of the poetry of this world. Similarly, he was sure that they had never heard of the classic poems from his world!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Many anchors and staff from the various channels had arrived. All segments had made way for today\u2019s Mid-Autumn Festival Poetry Meet.Zhang Ye had a stomach ache as he squatted on the toilet at the top floor. It might be due to having eaten too many instant noodles during the past few days. Even an Instant Noodle Hero would have times when he could not cope, for his stomach would also revolt. As he was squatting while doing his big business, he surfed the internet on his cellphone. He realized that the station\u2019s Mid-Autumn Poetry Meet had been publicized greatly. Not only was the publicizing in full swing on the radio station\u2019s website, it was also advertised on large message boards and other portal websites. Today was a public holiday, so most people were resting at home as they spent the festival with their friends and relatives. Noon was when people were gathered together to have lunch and chat. As they would be idle, listening into the poetry meet was a good choice. It was a very wise choice for the radio station to choose this time slot for the poetry meet.There was a lot of discussion on the internet, with numerous messages posted.\u201cPoetry Meet? Great!\u201d\u201cI must listen to it!\u201d\u201cLast year, the one that the Jinshi Radio Station organized was not bad. There were many good poems.\u201d\u201cHa. This year will be even better. Didn\u2019t you see that so many Teachers are coming from the Writers\u2019 Association? I guess that there will be at least one classic Mid-Autumn poem.\u201dThere were also people who heard of yesterday\u2019s Weibo war of words, or people who knew about Zhang Ye.\u201cEh? Meng Dongguo? A person who writes fairy tales like Little Red Mushroom is also going? The namelist also includes Big Thunder? Those poets who looked down on Teacher Zhang Ye?\u201d\u201cHaha! There will be something to see!\u201d\u201cRight. I remember that Zhang Ye works at Beijing Radio Station, right? Today\u2019s Literature Channel will also be broadcasting it? Teacher Zhang Ye will also be there too, right?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. They will meet each other!\u201d\u201cTo think that they were scolding each other yesterday, but now they are meeting today. You really don\u2019t meet unless you are enemies!\u201d\u201cWill Teacher Zhang go on stage to recite a poem? I\u2019m slightly looking forward to it!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. His name isn\u2019t on the namelist. It\u2019s all people from the Writers\u2019 Association!\u201dThere were supporters of Zhang Ye\u2019s poems, and naturally, there were even more who were fans of Meng Dongguo and the other Teachers. They were people who did not agree with Zhang Ye\u2019s prowess in literature!\u201cAll of you are still not convinced? Still speaking against Zhang Ye?\u201d\u201cIgnore those people. There\u2019s no way of getting through to them. It will only be troll bait!\u201d\u201cZhang Ye\u2019s name is definitely not on the namelist. Yesterday, the Teachers have already made it clear. This person is a demagogue. How is he able to write poems? At such an important event as this important Mid-Autumn Festival Poetry Meet, letting Zhang Ye go onstage would be a joke, since it\u2019s a live broadcast. His poems can deceive those who aren\u2019t knowledgeable. Those who are knowledgeable will just laugh silently at him, before letting others laugh their heads off.\u201d\u201cHurhur. I don\u2019t think Zhang Ye will dare to go up, even if he was asked to!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Don\u2019t talk big when you don\u2019t have what it takes!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m actually hoping that Zhang Ye will go on up. Previously, there was no comparison to let others know his true self. But with so many Teachers present, it will let everyone know what a true poem is. That crappy poem of Zhang Ye\u2019s will reveal its true colors. Let the Teachers teach the junior!\u201d\u201cSupport!\u201d\u201cWhat sort of crap is Zhang Ye!?\u201d\u201cThis person is just an empty vessel. I\u2019m guessing that he will definitely not go onstage. Have you seen the words Zhang Ye uses to curse? Your sister! As a cultured person, as a poet, how can you curse at others in this way? He doesn\u2019t have the temperament of a cultured person at a glance. The Teachers are right in questioning him. He can\u2019t write poems!\u201dBasically, they were all people who questioned Zhang Ye. He did not carry on reading as he left the bathroom.People who were invited were important figures. Seeing that the poetry meet was about to begin, the station\u2019s Leaders and the invited guests from the Writers\u2019 Association began walking in.Zhang Ye happened to meet them at the door.Deputy Station Head Jia smiled as he led them inside, \u201cPresident Meng, this is our auditorium. I remember that you have come here the year before?\u201dMeng Dongguo was a forty- to fifty-year-old plump man. He had quite a lot of hair and was not suffering from balding. He nodded, \u201cI did come once. That was for a meeting. I\u2019ve not seen Station Head Jia for two years. You sure seem as energetic as ever, while I can\u2019t go on anymore. Look at all these wrinkles.\u201dDeputy Station Head Jia seemed to have a good relationship with him, \u201cHaha. Come on. I\u2019ve already lost so much hair. I think you are the one as energetic as ever.\u201dAt this moment, a group of young ladies from the station piled forward the moment they saw them!\u201cTeacher Meng! You are Teacher Meng, right?\u201d a 20-year-old girl asked excitedly. She had rushed forward, despite her work to guide the line outside. \u201cI\u2019m your fan. I especially like your poems. My mom frequently recited your poems to me when I was young. I really grew up listening to your works. Aiyah! I\u2019m too excited, too excited. You, you\u2026 Can you give me an autograph?\u201dDeputy Station Head Jia waved his hand, \u201cThe meet is almost about to start.\u201dHowever, Meng Dongguo said, \u201cIt\u2019s alright, old Bro. Giving an autograph doesn\u2019t take much time. Here, young lady.\u201dThe girl got the autograph as she wished, before leaving happily.Seeing Meng Dongguo being so friendly, immediately, a few girls and youths came over to get his autograph.There were a few people who ran to the back and ignored if the Leader was agreeable to it. They found their own idols and Teachers they liked, so that they could get their autograph.\u201cAuntie Little Red Mushroom! You, I, can I get your autograph? I grew up listening to your fairy tales. I really like you!\u201d a youth said submissively.Little Red Mushroom was a bit plump, but she was dressed very prettily. She said in a nice way, \u201cSure. Where do I sign?\u201d\u201cTeacher Big Thunder!\u201d Another person came forward, \u201cYour poem has always been on my cellphone\u2019s home screen. Can I take a picture with you? Just one would do!\u201dBig Thunder was a big, stout man from the northeast. His accent was heavily northeastern. It was written in his personal information that he was from Beijing, but he might have grown up in the northeast. \u201cThat wouldn\u2019t be a problem! Here!\u201dAutographs, pictures together.The Teachers from the Writers\u2019 Association received quite a lot of praises from onlookers. It was no wonder, as they were very famous in Beijing. Since the Beijing Radio Station was broadcasting in the regions around Beijing, it would also broadcast their works occasionally. Hence, the staff were no strangers to these Teachers. Some even idolized them.Big Thunder? Meng Dongguo? Little Red Mushroom?There were still about a dozen people behind them. Hearing the fans shout, it seemed that there was also the romance author, Zheng Anbang?Weren\u2019t these people those who had scolded him yesterday? Hei, alright. All of them came?Zhang Ye stared deeply at all of them as he remembered all their faces. Suddenly, someone shouted at him from behind.\u201cTeacher Zhang Ye. Aiyah, I\u2019ve finally found you. I reserved a seat for you. Our Literature Channel\u2019s seats are in the middle of the back row. Let me bring you over.\u201d a youth who had just joined the Literature Channel said.\u201cAlright, let\u2019s go.\u201d Zhang Ye followed him into the auditorium.Zhang Ye?He is that Zhang Ye?Upon hearing this, Meng Dongguo, Big Thunder, Little Red Mushroom and company all looked over.Big Thunder was still confused over the situation. He did not have much of an impression of this name. Seeing Meng Dongguo and company\u2019s expression, Big Thunder finally remembered the name, as he asked, \u201cWhich Zhang Ye? The one who wrote the so-called modern poem?\u201dLittle Red Mushroom said, \u201cShould be.\u201dDeputy Station Head Jia confirmed, \u201cYes, it\u2019s him. Why?\u201dBig Thunder said, \u201cHe works at the radio station? I just learned about that.\u201dZheng Anbang said to Deputy Station Head Jia, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, Station Head Jia. We just happened to comment about him yesterday on the internet. He completely can\u2019t write poems, and things he writes cannot be considered literature. President Meng wanted to advise him as a senior, but he ended up unhappy about it. He was not modest at all, and even wrote a poem to retort. What would you call this matter? President Meng and us had good intentions, wanting to teach him, but he was ungrateful. He treated our kindness as dirt!\u201dDeputy Station Head Jia was enlightened as he laughed, \u201cZhang Ye is just a newcomer. He can be considered not bad when it comes to writing ghost stories, but as for composing poems\u2026 How can he compare to all of you? Hurhur.\u201dMeng Dongguo shook his hands, \u201cLet\u2019s not talk about him, old Bro. Let\u2019s go in?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go. It\u2019s about to begin.\u201d Deputy Station Head Jia and a few smaller Leaders in the station led them in. They sat in the first row.The surrounding people looked at each other.\u201cDid you see Zhang Ye\u2019s Weibo yesterday?\u201d\u201cI saw it. I never expected them to meet today!\u201d\u201cI think that something is going to happen. Who doesn\u2019t know what sort of temper Teacher Zhang Ye has? When has there ever not been something happening when he\u2019s around? Hopefully, they don\u2019t end up fighting.\u201d\u201cI doubt it. I don\u2019t think it will be as bad as fighting.\u201d\u201cCultured people tend to scorn each other. People from the Writers\u2019 Association insisted that Zhang Ye doesn\u2019t know literature. And with Teacher Little Zhang\u2019s personality, it would be a wonder if he could endure it. What sort of person is Teacher Little Zhang? He is a person who would even curse at his colleagues. He is a person who doesn\u2019t give face to the station\u2019s Leader. Watch and see. I believe that today will not end peacefully.\u201dIn the radio station\u2019s other channels, Zhang Ye was currently quite famous. Everyone knew him, so once the situation was understood, they had a feeling that a storm was about to brew.\u2026In the middle of the back row of the auditorium.Zhang Ye sat at his seat. To his left was Wang Xiaomei, and to his right was Wu Datao. He had bad relations with Wu Datao, so they naturally did not speak. Wang Xiaomei was well-known to be quiet, and seldom exchanged words with Zhang Ye; hence, Zhang Ye only looked down at his cellphone.And of course, the cellphone\u2019s reception wasn\u2019t good.It might have been due to the good sound isolation of the auditorium, which also blocked out the reception.Zhang Ye only managed to go on the internet after trying a few times. The judging interface of the radio station\u2019s Mid-Autumn Festival Poetry Meet indicated that it had already begun. There were quite a lot of listeners and people from all walks of life publishing their works. Some wrote ancient poems, while some wrote phrases. Some were modern poems, and some were original song lyrics that were relevant to the Mid-Autumn Festival. There was no prize for this meet, but there was glory to it. If you could gain any spot in the top three, it would cause your fame to rise sharply in the industry. Hence, there were many people who participated.However, the content was nothing flattering.\u201cThe moon, my moon, you are so beautiful\u2026\u201d\u201cMid-Autumn Festival, families eat mooncakes. Finishing one, eating another one.\u201dZhang Ye nearly cried tears seeing this. The voting process had already begun, but even the number one voted poem was average. The quality was not high.Dong.The doors to the auditorium closed.The last signal bar on the cellphone disappeared. There was no way of going on the internet, so Zhang Ye kept his phone in his pocket. He was pondering how he could correct his reputation!My poems aren\u2019t good?My poems have no literary value?This was not denying Zhang Ye, but denying the famous masters of his world. Zhang Ye felt amused for them. This was only happening in this world. If it was switched to Zhang Ye\u2019s world, would Meng Dongguo and company dare to question these poems? They would only be beaten to death if they did!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A handsome man and a beautiful man presided over the event as hosts. Well, unfortunately, only the staff and family members present at the radio station could witness this. The listeners in front of the radio could not appreciate this, as they could only hear their voices.\u201cOur listening friends, how are you?\u201d\u201cI am your host, Zhang Huo. This is my partner, Sun Mengjie.\u201d\u201cPeople have reunions during the festive season of Mid-Autumn. Welcome to our listeners for today\u2019s News, Literature and Music Channels\u2019 live broadcast of the Mid-Autumn Festival Poetry Meet!\u201dThe two hosts were the star hosts of the News Channel, and they were recognized as some of the best in the station. They were steady with their words and rarely made mistakes. Letting them be in charge of this huge event was because they were highly appreciated by the station. After saying a few words of introduction, the two hosts began to introduce today\u2019s guests.\u201cLet us welcome Beijing\u2019s Education Ministry\u2019s Deputy Director, Chen Kun!\u201d\u201cAlso Beijing Writers\u2019 Association\u2019s Vice-President, Teacher Meng Dongguo!\u201d\u201cFamous poet, Big Thunder!\u201d\u201cFamous children\u2019s fairy tale author, Little Red Mushroom\u2026\u201dEvery introduction was met with applause.After the introduction, the host, Zhang Huo, said beamingly, \u201cBefore the poetry meet begins, let\u2019s invite a few Teachers from the Writers\u2019 Association to come onstage to recite a poem as an opening. We also wish that the listeners in front of the radio have a good and perfect family. May your dreams come true. And may you have the best of all reunions!\u201dThe poem recitation for the opening was clearly prepared beforehand.Meng Dongguo was first to go onstage, and then he lightly recited, \u201cMany Mid-Autumns underwent, but together seldom spent. Compensating it today, mellow, as a momento.\u201dWith this sequence recited, everyone present knew what poem they were about to recite to tune up the festive mood. Of course, Zhang Ye himself was probably the only one present who had not heard of this poem.Big Thunder went onstage, \u201cThrough the mirror, possessing two moons.\u201dZheng Anbang went onstage, \u201cWrapping silence with a wooden branch.\u201dAn old man from the Writers\u2019 Association that Zhang Ye did not recognize was the third person to follow up, \u201cFragrance from one tree lulls.\u201dThe last sentence was followed up by Meng Dongguo, ending the poem, \u201cBrimming full of Fall.\u201dEveryone enthusiastically applauded. Zhang Ye also applauded after hearing it. This poem was not bad, it was really not bad.This poem was \u201cTime for Well Wishes\u201d, written by this world\u2019s famous poet, Ma Ruihong. Because of some reason, this poem was made famous everywhere. It was always a highlight of the Mid-Autumn Festival. Only a person like Zhang Ye, who did not understand this world, did not know it. Not many others did not know of \u201cTime for Well Wishes\u201d. Anyone of any age and gender, if pulled off the street, would be able to recite it. Yes, if an example was needed, it was the same feeling as \u201cHoeing millet in mid-day heat, sweat dripping to the earth beneath\u201d in Zhang Ye\u2019s world.Zhang Ye no longer had the intention to belittle all heroes of this world. This world was also filled with capable predecessors.After the poem was done reciting, Beijing\u2019s Education Ministry\u2019s Deputy Director, Chen Kun, went to the podium to give his speech. Following that, Deputy Station Head Jia also went onstage to give his speech, wishing everyone a happy Mid-Autumn Festival on behalf of everyone working at the Beijing Radio Station.After a while, the main highlight came.The female host, Sun Mengjie, said with a brilliant smile, \u201cThank you for the speech of the Leader. Next will be the poetry contest segment. Let me introduce the rules. Regardless of whether it is for the poems by the Teachers from the Writers\u2019 Association present, or for the poems posted by listeners on our official website, anyone who likes poems can vote three times for the works you like. Today, we have invited a notary from the Chengdong district. We will find out who is voted into the top three. So please, cherish your every vote.\u201dZhang Huo smiled, \u201cThen, who will be the first Teacher?\u201dThere were more than a dozen people from the Writers\u2019 Association. After looking at each other, Meng Dongguo walked forward, \u201cHurhur. Since no one came forward, then let me be the first. I have a poem.\u201d Clenching the microphone, Meng Dongguo stabilized his mind and began speaking gently, \u201cThe poem\u2019s name: \u2018Thoughts of a Rainy Mid-Autumn Night\u2019.\u201d\u201cAbundance of flower blossoms fall, the full moon laments the waning moon.\u201d\u201cDay by day the Spring resides, farewell the twilight bids.\u201d\u201cThickness begets flourishing, sparseness begets Autumn farewell bidding.\u201d\u201cThe supporting pillow hears the thunder, as the stormy rain recalls the night.\u201dBig Thunder was the first to applaud, \u201cGood poem!\u201dAnother youth from the Writers\u2019 Association said, \u201cPresident Meng is getting more superb!\u201dZheng Anbang also nodded, \u201cIt is well-written. There are too many reunion Mid-Autumn Festival poems these days. This poem reverses the trend, writing about separation, defects and weeping. It may not give people the scene of a family reunion, so it is not suitable for the occasion, but this makes people reflect and treasure the beauty of their reunion even more. This is writing about the Mid-Autumn Festival from another angle. This part of \u201crecalls the night\u201d was so well-written. Hai, I don\u2019t even feel confident with my poem.\u201dLittle Red Mushroom gave a wide smile, \u201cOld Zheng, don\u2019t compete with them. We are novel writers, so wouldn\u2019t we die of anger competing with them over poems?\u201dZheng Anbang laughed, \u201cIndeed.\u201dThe two hosts also flattered onstage. They also introduced them to the listeners since they could not see anything. \u201cThis is the Beijing Writers\u2019 Association\u2019s Vice President Teacher Meng Dongguo\u2019s new work. Wow, just hearing this makes me intoxicated.\u201dMeng Dongguo laughed, \u201cNot really. Hurhur. If the listeners find it good, remember to vote for me. I came here with some stress. If my voting numbers are too low, I won\u2019t have any face to go home, so I need to try to garner some votes.\u201dZhang Huo said, \u201cPresident Meng is too modest.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Sun Mengjie said, \u201cI think this poem has the looks of a champion.\u201d\u201cThis is just the first poem, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Zhang Huo pretended to ask.\u201cHurhur. Zhang Huo, why don\u2019t we make a bet? I\u2019m guessing that this poem will be first.\u201d Firstly, Sun Mengjie was giving face to Meng Dongguo. Secondly, she also felt that this poem was very good.Zhang Huo said, \u201cAlright, so what if we bet? Then I.. will also bet that this poem will be first!\u201dSeeing the both of them joking around, the audience laughed. Actually, many people agreed. Meng Dongguo was a professional at this, so how can his poems be bad? With his skills placed there, and with Meng Dongguo\u2019s status placed there, he was the Writers\u2019 Association\u2019s Leader and was quite famous in Beijing. He was a veteran. Even if this poem was not flattered by them to the heavens, it was still of very high quality. It was pretty difficult for it not to get first.Meng Dongguo went down.The second person was Zheng Anbang. The moment he went onstage, he added onto Meng Dongguo\u2019s words, \u201cPresident Meng said that he was stressed. Actually, my stress is greater. Just being after President Meng, isn\u2019t he trying to make a fool out of me? Forget it. I need to say it regardless. I\u2019m not good at ancient poems, so let me help cheer the mood with a modern poem.\u201dA minute later, he finished.Everyone was stunned as they all gave a round of applause.Meng Dongguo praised, \u201cThis Little Shen. He kept being modest, but he actually had such a good piece of work.\u201dThe other people from the Writers\u2019 Association did not expect that a romance novel author could compose such a good modern poem. It might not be better than Meng Dongguo\u2019s, but it definitely had what it took to compete for second or third place.The third to go onstage was a young author. However, he did not recite a poem, but said a phrase, song lyrics. Although there was no companion music, the song lyrics were still vivid and refined. It was very creative.The fourth person was Little Red Mushroom. The moment she went up, she first said, \u201cLet me say something first. I don\u2019t have talent writing poems. I write fairy tales. Today I will tell a fable.\u201d She began narrating. The story was about personification, making the moon into a person. It was quite beautiful.One worked followed another.One person followed another.Everyone that entered the Writers\u2019 Association was not simple. They all showed their abilities.The last person to appear was Big Thunder. His poems were always known for their magnificence. It was similar to his character. Hence, the theme of the Mid-Autumn Festival had hindered his abilities slightly. He narrated a melody poem, but the effect was not as satisfactory as he had wished. It did not garner a lot of applause. However, as it had quite a lot of literary value, the melody poem managed to make people reflect a lot. Meng Dongguo and the other Teachers from the Writers\u2019 Association also gave him high praises after he came down.\u201cBig Thunder, it was a nice melody poem.\u201d\u201cDo not care about the applause. It\u2019s very good.\u201d\u201cTheir applause is lacking because they can\u2019t understand it. They have not researched it deeply. If they listen to it several times, after some rumination, they will really find it memorable.\u201dBig Thunder said indifferently, \u201cI also think it\u2019s fine.\u201dAbout an hour after the poetry meet started, it was almost 1 P.M.The host, Zhang Huo, took over the microphone, \u201cThank you for the interesting works from the Teachers of the Writers\u2019 Association. It was indeed an eye-opener today. Every work really made me wish to not miss a single word. I\u2019m guessing that the listeners in front of the radio must have enjoyed the feast for the ears. What are you hesitating for? Quickly vote for your favorite work. The voting deadline is at 2 P.M. sharp. Just now, the notary has told us that it takes five minutes to verify the votes. Hence, our poetry meet still has one hour and five minutes left. What will we do for the rest of the time? Let us announce the rankings from the voting website. Everyone can have a listen to the submissions by the netizens at the same time, too.\u201dFemale host, Sun Mengjie, held a tablet. There was no cellphone reception here, so most of the broadcast equipment was equipped with their own wireless signal. Hence, they could still use them. \u201cAh, let\u2019s see. Ranked first is Teacher Meng Dongguo\u2019s work. Let me announce the top ten.\u201d1st place: Meng Dongguo, 23,019 votes.2nd place: Zheng Anbang, 12,553 votes.3rd place: Dong Fei, 9,813 votes.4th place: Little Red Mushroom, 9,681 votes.And so on and so forth. The top ten were all people from the Writers\u2019 Association. Meng Dongguo was leading far ahead. Dong Fei was also a very famous modern poet in the Writers\u2019 Association. They all swept up the top spots. Even though Big Thunder\u2019s poem was not well-received amongst the station\u2019s staff, it had also obtained 10th place. Only at 11th place was there a netizen\u2019s work.The host read it out.This piece of work called \u201cWind Breaking Through the Clouds\u201d was not bad. But it was just not bad. There was always a difference between a professional and an amateur. One could tell just from the votes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

See you, or not, there will you stay, no sorrow, nor joy? I didn\u2019t take that seriously.\u201dZhang Ye was embarrassed. It was true; he was not that forgiving.\u201cDo you need me to ask around for whose phone has a signal? And borrow it for you?\u201d Wang Xiaomei took the initiative.Zhang Ye replied, \u201cThere\u2019s no need for that. If I want to post, I will go outside to post. But I have yet to think of a poem. Teacher Xiaomei, what\u2019s with you?\u201d\u201cWhy I am so enthusiastic?\u201d Wang Xiaomei answered, \u201cBecause you are the representative of our Literature Channel. You already are our channel\u2019s branded host. If they doubt you, it means they are denying our Literature Channel\u2019s cultural standard. Besides, I don\u2019t think that your poems are worse than theirs. I cannot feel no sorrow, nor joy. I am angry right now.\u201d\u2026Onstage.The poetry event has progressed to the poetry recital and appreciation round.After reading a few netizens\u2019 poems, Zhang Huo spoke, \u201cThese few poems are pretty well-written. It looks like our netizens are also capable people. Haha. But Sun Mengjie and I are really just here to watch. We are not professionals, so would still hope that the teachers from the Writers\u2019 Association would enlighten us a bit.\u201dThe participants from the Writers\u2019 Association passed around the responsibility for a while.Finally, Meng Dongguo stood up, as expected. He was the one with the most influence within the group, \u201cAfter listening to a few of the poems, I find them still to be okay.\u201dThe female host said, \u201cStill okay? I can understand President Meng\u2019s thought on this; so that means they still have their problems?\u201dMeng Dongguo laughed \u201cThey are only amateurs, so to be able to write like this is not bad.\u201d\u201cCan you explain to us the differences between their poems and a professional\u2019s? We are still unclear; perhaps everyone here is unclear. The poems sounded pretty good.\u201d Zhang Huo pretended to be a layman.Meng Dongguo touched his beard and spoke honestly, \u201cThose who don\u2019t understand poetry may not be able to tell the difference. On the surface, it\u2019s quite good. The writing and phrases are elegant. But there are too many ways to read into it. Like the work \u201cWind Breaking Through Clouds\u201d by that netizen\u2026 A professional would know immediately that there are issues with it. The modern-style poetry he wrote? It\u2019s actually not. Modern-style poetry must adhere to a certain tonal pattern, rhyme scheme and parallelism. With the five character poems as an example, it must start with a level tone. The second part requires a deflected tone. Then the third part requires it to go back to the level tone. On the contrary, if the first part uses a deflected tone, then the second part requires a level tone, then in the third part, it has to be a deflected tone. He was not right with that.\u201dZhang Huo was enlightened, \u201cI see.\u201dMeng Dongguo said, \u201cHence, if they are amateurs or beginners, they are recommended to write modern poems. The requirements are simpler. Well, one of the modern poems that the hosts recited also had a small problem. The mood seemed a bit off, and the entire poem did not have a core literary belief. In our jargon, we would say that it\u2019s lacking \u2018spirit\u2019. The words used are pretty, but literature eventually needs to abide by literature. It needs to move the hearts of the people. If a poem that is lacking in essence, energy and spirit, it cannot move the hearts of people, then it is empty at its core. It is just showy.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re gaining knowledge here.\u201d Zhang Huo said.Meng Dongguo seemed like he was hooked onto saying more. It was unsure if he did it consciously, but he suddenly mentioned, \u201cLike recently on the internet, there have been several poems with a lot of views. Actually, in my opinion, there are some flaws in their conception. Of course, this could be a matter of \u2018beauty is in the eyes of the beholder\u2019, so there\u2019s still room for discussion.\u201dSun Mengjie added, \u201cVice President Meng, are you talking about \u2018Flying Bird and Fish\u2019? Or \u2018The Song of the Stormy Petrel\u2019?\u201dMeng Dongguo smiled, \u201cI\u2019ve mentioned it on Weibo. Those who have seen it will know. I have my reservations about these two poems.\u201dWhat?Zhang Ye was mentioned?Immediately, quite a number looked towards Zhang Ye. Zhang Ye\u2019s seat had become the focus of attention, with many eyes on it.Zhang Ye had not expected Meng Dongguo to question him openly like this at such an important event like the Mid-Autumn Festival Poetry Meet. What\u2019s more, this was a live event and held at Zhang Ye\u2019s own unit. Meng Dongguo was now publicly invalidating him and killing his chances with just a simple nod? Did I f***ing kill your father or your mother? Why are you trying to fix me? After your online \u201ceducation\u201d, you now came to my unit to \u201ceducate\u201d me? Are you f***ing sick!?\u201cWhat sort of people are they!?\u201d\u201cHow can they say such things?\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy for Teacher Little Zhang, too. What are they trying to do?\u201d\u201cThis is a live broadcast program! Aren\u2019t they trying to destroy him!? They are pushing it too far!\u201dMany of the Literature Channel\u2019s employees could no longer bear to continue listening. Even those who did not know Zhang Ye well were feeling angry. Yes, even if Zhang Ye was not a professional poet, even if Zhang Ye\u2019s poems were ordinary and not comparable to yours or have literary standards\u2026 But you still can\u2019t bully your way around here like that! These people from the Writers\u2019 Association were really too much! This was their unit! This was their radio station!\u2026At this moment.The poetry meet\u2019s website blew up!\u201cDid you hear that?\u201d\u201cTeacher Meng said \u2018Flying Bird and Fish\u2019 and \u2018The Song of the Stormy Petrel\u2019 were problematic?\u201d\u201cThat can\u2019t be? I think those two poems are very good!\u201d\u201cCan the Vice President of the Writers\u2019 Association be wrong? So that Zhang Ye actually isn\u2019t anything. I was still wondering over all that clicks and forwards. So it was just crap!\u201d\u201cRight, this person does not have any ability!\u201d\u201cZhang Ye\u2019s poem really has a problem?\u201dMany people who weren\u2019t already in the know of yesterday\u2019s incident on Weibo became informed of it now. Today, right now, was even Zhang Ye\u2019s \u201cOld and Young Story Club\u201d program\u2019s schedule. The event was broadcast live through the Literature Channel and many of Zhang Ye\u2019s listeners were tuned in. To be passed judgement upon by such an authoritative person like the Writers\u2019 Association\u2019s Vice President, it would be expected that from tomorrow onwards, Zhang Ye\u2019s segment listenership ratings would be dealt a big blow. A listenership ratings drop of more than half would even be possible. Perhaps those who really liked Zhang Ye or those who held their own views would not be affected, but how about the others? The citizens\u2019 views would be affected by herd mentality and belief in authoritative figures!A newcomer host!An industry\u2019s Writers\u2019 Association Vice President!Whose literary level would everyone believe in? It was clear at a glance!This move by Meng Dongguo was really vicious, with the objective to kill off Zhang Ye\u2019s chances!Zhang Ye was bursting with anger. This was really forcing his hand!Zhang Huo secretly glanced over to his partner, Sun Mengjie, blaming her for saying a little too much. He was actually biased towards Zhang Ye. It wasn\u2019t because of Zhang Ye\u2019s poems; he also believed that Zhang Ye, as a newcomer, could not be better than these teachers from the Writers\u2019 Association. But because Zhang Ye was his colleague and Meng Dongguo had publicly doubted him, Zhang Huo felt that this was uncalled for. After taking a look at the computer tablet, Zhang Huo continued, \u201cTeacher Meng, the two poems you just mentioned\u2026 From my understanding, they were composed by our Literature Channel\u2019s Teacher Zhang Ye. Teacher Zhang Ye should be here at the venue, too. I\u2019ve seen the comments left by our listeners and they all feel that \u2018Flying Bird and Fish\u2019 is really good. All of them don\u2019t seem to understand what\u2019s lacking in the poem.\u201dMeng Dongguo smiled without a word, before he said, \u201cLet\u2019s have Big Thunder explain; he is a specialist in modern poems and also a well-known critic. He would explain better than me.\u201dOn hearing that, Big Thunder stepped up, \u201cHaha. Since President Meng called me out and the subject is on this, it\u2019s now the poetry appreciation segment, so let me bring up an example to explain. Actually, President Meng had already said it once on Weibo last night and I fully agree with it. \u2018Flying Bird and Fish\u2019 has become very popular on the internet recently, but it is so because of the circumstances at that time. Because this poem has saved someone\u2019s life before, it leads to it being hotly followed and discussed, furthering its popularity. This practically added a lot of value based on the circumstances. There aren\u2019t much literary learnings within the poem; likewise for other works by Zhang Ye. Its depth in essence, energy and spirit are just imaginary and I cannot see what he wanted to express. So in the eyes of us professionals, the author is just an amateur hobbyist.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like this?\u201d Zhang Huo questioned.Meng Dongguo chimed in, \u201cExplaining this way would not be clear enough for everyone here. Since Zhang Ye is here today as well, why don\u2019t we invite him onto the stage, so that he can compose a Mid-Autumn Festival poem. We will analyze the flaws in it for everyone, so that it will be clearer to understand.\u201d\u201cThis\u2026..\u201d Zhang Huo looked towards the station\u2019s Leader.Sun Mengjie could not make a call either. Although there was still a lot of time, but to let their colleague come up onto the stage to be treated as a negative example? To be slapped in the face by Meng Dongguo and company right in front of everyone? They couldn\u2019t bear with the thought of it!Big Thunder agreed, \u201cIs this not the poetry appreciation segment? It\u2019s for everyone to learn more about the traditions of poetry.\u201dThey were both singing each other\u2019s tunes. Zhang Ye\u2019s reputation was decided before he could say anything \u2014 Zhang Ye was an amateur; they had wanted to show the differences between a professional and an amateur!Deputy Station Head Jia looked at Zhang Huo, and pondered for a moment before he nodded slightly.Zhang Huo then said, \u201cAlright, then. But we need to know first if Teacher Zhang Ye has any new works. Because Teacher Zhang Ye was not informed beforehand of this poetry meet. This was impromptu, so\u2026..\u201d The Writers\u2019 Association was informed much earlier to give them some time to make preparations. But Zhang Ye was not given this advantage. With Meng Dongguo and Big Thunder yelling for Zhang Ye to come onto the stage, Zhang Huo felt they had really overstepped their boundaries, not even allowing for a minute of preparation! They really wanted to pick on Zhang Ye\u2019s flaws, to strike him a fatal blow! What feud is there between all of you? That it had to come to this, to step over our colleague? The critical issue was that even Deputy Station Head Jia had agreed to this impudent proposal?Many eyes were focused on them!Zhang Ye let out a furious laughter. You want me to go up? You want to slap my face? You guys are courting death!Wang Xiaomei\u2019s eyes had already gone dark upon hearing what was said. She said to Zhang Ye, \u201cLet them see, Teacher Little Zhang!\u201d \u201cShow them whether we hosts from the Literature Channel understand art and literature!\u201d said a furious Wang Xiaomei!In front, Big Sis Zhou turned back, \u201cTeacher Little Zhang! Attack!\u201dAuntie Sun, who did not really acknowledge Zhang Ye\u2019s poems, could no longer bear with this. She shouted across two rows of seats, \u201cLittle Zhang! Go get them! This is pushing it too far!\u201dTian Bin, putting on a damper, said, \u201cForget it; don\u2019t go!\u201dWu Datao shook his head, \u201cLittle Zhang, listen to me and don\u2019t go. An amateur like you wants to put on a fake act in front of the professionals? Just say that you aren\u2019t prepared; otherwise, when they criticize and point out your flaws, not only will you be embarrassed, even our Literature Channel will be embarrassed!\u201dAll around, colleagues from the channel softly advised, \u201cTeacher Zhang, ignore them.\u201dSome colleagues who wanted justice for Zhang Ye said, \u201cIf they are capable, let\u2019s see them challenge Teacher Zhang in ghost stories! If they are capable, let\u2019s see them challenge Teacher Zhang in fairy tales! Story writing is the true profession of Zhang Ye! Competing with poetry won\u2019t determine anything! You all have been in this for so many years! Isn\u2019t it a shameful for you to compete with a rookie? Eh?\u201dIt was a little messy in the audience.The auditorium\u2019s mood was slowly losing control!But under the spotlight, Zhang Ye stood up without any resistance. He smiled coldly, looked towards Zhang Huo, and signaled a \u20181\u2019 determinedly. This was a signal everyone in the station knew. When hosting a radio live broadcast, \u20181\u2019 would be signaled to the assistants to convey readiness.\u201cZhang Ye!\u201d\u201cTeacher Zhang! Think carefully!\u201d\u201cAiyo! Don\u2019t go! Don\u2019t you see that they are purposely making it difficult for you?\u201dZhang Ye didn\u2019t listen; he was already making his way out past the row of seats.Zhang Huo understood, \u201cTeacher Zhang has said that he is okay. Everyone, please give some applause.\u201dMeng Dongguo was waiting for Zhang Ye to recite before he passed his judgment on Zhang Ye\u2019s flaws for everyone listening.Zheng Anbang and Little Red Mushroom were also waiting for Zhang Ye to make a joke of himself. The others also knew that this time Zhang Ye would embarrass himself, but yet he willingly stepped up to be embarrassed!In the applause that was either disturbing, helpless or gloating, Zhang Ye followed his determination up towards the stage. In the spotlight, and on the red carpet, this was his first time standing in front of so many people, unlike the sealed-up space of the recording studios. It was a meaningful face-to-face experience with so many people. But Zhang Ye did not have stage fright. This psychological strength of his had always been very good. Instead, he seemed to enjoy this moment!Since you have forced me out, I will respectfully obey!My poems have no literary value?I am biting off more than I can chew by displaying my incompetence in front of an expert?I am an amateur while you are a professional?Alright, then! Today, I\u2019ll let you bunch of Beijing Writers\u2019 Association people know who is the amateur and who is the professional!Sun Mengjie tried to stall for time for Zhang Ye, \u201cTeacher Zhang, since you were unprepared, please don\u2019t rush. You can take your time to think it through.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need,\u201d Zhang Ye said.Zhang Huo paused. There was no need to consider? Creating the work on the spot?Big Thunder disdainfully looked on. On the fly composing? What\u2019s more, a poem that has a theme? Even for him, he would need at least half an hour to seek inspiration! If I can\u2019t do it, how could you?Of course, Zhang Ye did not need any preparations, nor did he even feel a need for preparations. A poem had already appeared in his head!When he knew about the Mid-Autumn Poetry Meet, Zhang Ye began thinking about which poem he should use. He had not decided on or even wanted to use this poem. Why? Because this poem was too classic! A classic that when someone mentions Mid-Autumn and poems, 9 out of 10 people would think of this! After this poem existed, there were no other poems for Mid-Autumn! It could be said that no other poems could measure up to the influence of this poem!To compose for Mid-Autumn, this would be the top choice!It deserves the spot!Zhang Ye did not want to choose it; he had wanted to leave some leeway for them. But after seeing how Meng Dongguo, Big Thunder and the others played dirty to force him, Zhang Ye no longer wanted to hold back!Some of the audience were anxious.Big Sis Zhou urgently asked, \u201cIs Little Zhang going to be alright?\u201dAuntie Sun replied, \u201cEven if he cannot, he mustn\u2019t lose his composure. That group of people have already s*** on our heads!\u201dTian Bin purposely sighed, \u201cWas that necessary? Isn\u2019t he asking for it? This Zhang Ye is really..! An amateur is an amateur!\u201dDespite all the talk, Zhang Ye touched the microphone and took in a light breath, \u201cWhen will the moon be clear and bright? With a cup of wine in my hand, I ask the clear sky. In the heavens on this night, I wonder what season it would be?\u201dEveryone was stunned when he said those lines!He wasn\u2019t using the modern poems that he was good at? And he chose a melody poem? Zhang Ye could also write melody poems?And why was this melody poem.. able to make people have goose bumps? This\u2026Zhang Ye closed his eyes as he looked up at the ceiling. He was completely in a recitation mood, \u201cI\u2019d like to ride the wind to return home. Yet, I fear the crystal and jade mansions are much too high and cold for me. Dancing with my moonlit shadow, it does not seem like the human world. The moon rounds the red mansion, stoops to silk-padded doors, shines upon the sleepless. Bearing no grudge, why does the moon tend to be full when people are apart? People experience sorrow, joy, separation and reunion. The moon may be dim or bright, round or crescent shaped. This imperfection has been going on since the beginning of time.\u201d After pausing for two seconds, Zhang Ye opened his eyes. With his gaze soft, he slowly read the last sentence, \u201cMay we all be blessed with longevity; though thousands of miles apart, we are still able to share.. the beauty of the moon together.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Everyone present seemed to have their goosebumps explode. They were momentarily silent! The entire auditorium was echoing with the sound from the microphone!With the poem unleashed, it shocked the entire auditorium!Meng Dongguo was already stunned when he heard half of it!Big Thunder, Zheng Anbang, Little Red Mushroom and the other Writers\u2019 Association\u2019s Teachers were dumbfounded!Even without mentioning them, one could tell just by observing the atmosphere in the auditorium. Everyone in the audience had turned silent. Even the host, Zhang Huo, was at a loss for words while holding onto the microphone. The female host, Sung Mengjie, was even worse. She stared straight ahead and did not even realize that her hand had lost its grip on the microphone. Only when it issued a heavy thud on the red-carpeted floor of the podium did she come around. Following this, the souls of the people returned to their empty bodies, as if they had just crawled down from the moon in Zhang Ye\u2019s poem!Wow!Shouts immediately exploded!\u201cGood poem!\u201d\u201cWhat the f***!\u201d\u201cHeavens! What did I just hear!\u201d\u201cThe pen of God! The pen of God!\u201d\u201cToo awesome! This poem is enough to explode!\u201dSome people could not help but stand up and applaud loudly!Director Zhao Guozhou and Wang Xiaomei were stunned!Big Sis Zhou exclaimed, \u201cWhat a good melody poem! Teacher Little Zhang really created it on the spot? Oh, my God! Oh, my Buddha! Oh, my Guanyin Bodhisattva! Oh, my Jesus! Oh, my Heavens!\u201d She believed in quite a few religions, as there were all sorts of variations. \u201cThat \u2018The Song of the Stormy Petrel\u2019 was made on the spot. \u2018Flying Bird and Fish\u2019 and \u2018A Generation\u2019 were also improvised on the spot. \u2018See Me or Not\u2019 was also written there and then. This is also written at the last minute? How could this be possible!? What sort of brain does Teacher Little Zhang have!?\u201dWow!It was unknown who gave the first applause! Thunderous applause!This was not an analogous description! It was really like thunder! The entire auditorium\u2019s ceiling seemed to have been blown away! Other than applause, nothing else could be heard!What was good about this melody poem? Many laymen might not be able to tell what was good about it, but they knew that it was definitely good.Only Meng Dongguo, Zheng Anbang and company knew what realm this melody poem had reached. This was written too well. It revolved around the thoughts and imagination that opened up due to the Mid-Autumn\u2019s moon. It embodied the joys and sorrows of the world into a philosophical pursuit of the meaning of life and the universe!When will the moon be clear and bright? With a cup of wine in my hand, I ask the clear sky.In the heavens on this night, I wonder what season it would be?Almost every word was classic. Each word had a charm to it. Some of the words even needed to be repeated several times to gain an understanding of the profound meaning behind it! For example, the sentence, \u201cride the wind to return home\u201d? Why was the word \u201creturn\u201d used? A few people from the Writers\u2019 Association did not understand the first time that they heard it. Only as they heard to the end did they slowly understand. The word \u201creturn\u201d was the finishing touch. It expressed how the original author, Zhang Ye, was in fact not treating himself as a mortal of this world. He treated himself as an immortal that had detached from the world; hence, he needed to \u201creturn\u201d to the immortal palace, and not \u201cgo\u201d to the immortal palace. It sounded insolent, but this melody poem\u2019s essence, energy and spirit had suddenly broke the confines of this world, and had raised the bar by more than one grade! Coupled with the ending sentence, the dozen or so Teachers and authors from the Writers\u2019 Association were too shocked for words!Zhang Ye?Who was he?What sort of person is he!?Other than Meng Dongguo and Little Red Mushroom understanding Zhang Ye a bit more, the other Teachers from the Writers\u2019 Association did not know this person. They had never even heard of him; hence, they were so shocked. How could a person that could write such a melody poem be some nobody? How could he be a rookie that they had never heard of? Furthermore, these people had prepared for the Mid-Autumn Poetry Meet for several days, while this person was called out onto the stage! He did not even have time to prepare! Just this alone! No one present felt that they could do it themselves! What\u2019s more, he produced such a shockingly great melody poem!When did the realm of poetry have such an awesome person!?Two minutes. The applause lasted for two minutes before it ended!\u201cZhang Ye!\u201d\u201cZhang Ye!\u201d\u201cZhang Ye!\u201d\u201cZhang Ye!\u201dFinally, loud cries began to shout out in unison. Many people were calling out Zhang Ye\u2019s name, cheering him on and encouraging him. They were backing him!Why?It was because Meng Dongguo was too much of a bully!He had publicly invalidated Zhang Ye? And even said that he was an amateur? And even called him out to get him onstage for a showdown? And even wanted to find his faults, so as to show everyone how to write a poem? Don\u2019t forget that this was Beijing Radio Station. It was Zhang Ye\u2019s unit. Everyone was a bit angry that their colleague had been bullied! Hence, seeing Zhang Ye coming up with such a magical and godlike poem in an impressive fashion, everyone seemed like they were on stimulants as they cheered him on. Although they were cheering on Zhang Ye\u2019s name on the surface, they were in fact trampling on Meng Dongguo, Big Thunder and company!Deputy Station Head Jia\u2019s face turned black. He stood up to clap his hands. This was a live broadcast. What were they doing!?Seeing the station\u2019s Leader\u2019s attitude, everyone stopped shouting and began to sit down one after another. They were all waiting to see the commotion that was to follow!The host, Zhang Huo, managed to come around and speak. As he drew in his breath, he asked, \u201cTeacher Zhang Ye, what is the name of this melody poem? Can you tell us?\u201dZhang Ye smiled, \u201cIt\u2019s called \u2018Shuidiao Getou\u2019.\u201dSun Mengjie said, \u201cI already do not know how to evaluate it. I\u2019m a layperson and do not understand melody poems much. However, with me dropping the microphone without realizing it, you should know how much I love this poem. Really, I love this poem to death. Its words are beautiful to an extreme!\u201dZhang Ye was a person who did not fear stirring up chaos in the world. He immediately said, \u201cIt\u2019s alright. You are a layperson, but there are many experts on-site. They are professional Teachers from the Writers\u2019 Association.\u201d Turning his head, he looked towards Meng Dongguo and Big Thunder. Both of them had already returned to their seats when Zhang Ye recited his poem; however, Zhang Ye was able to find them with a glance. \u201cTeacher Meng, Teacher Big Thunder\u2026 Previously, the both of you said my works have no literary value. Previously, you have also said I might not be good at writing poems. Yes, I admit I\u2019m a beginner and an amateur. I shall modestly ask you Teachers for advice to please help me improve my level. Can you advise me on this poem?\u201dZhang Huo nearly burst out laughing.Sun Mengjie was also at a loss as to whether to laugh or to cry.Upon hearing this, Big Thunder nearly vomited a mouthful of blood. He nearly cursed his mother. Your granduncle! I advise you, my ass!Find a problem? Find faults? I haven\u2019t even fully understood the melody poem\u2019s complete meaning! Where can I find fault with it!? Although he was unrelenting and was angry, most of this anger came from being embarrassed. To be fair, Big Thunder had no choice but to admit that Zhang Ye\u2019s poem was flawlessly perfect. Not even them, probably no one could pick a fault with it. Zhang Ye had trampled on them!Meng Dongguo was even more direct. He stood beside a youth from the Writers\u2019 Association and whispered with his head down. It was as if he was discussing the poem and had pretended not to hear Zhang Ye\u2019s words.Everyone who had called him out no longer made a noise!Against such a dazzling poem, they had no means of making a noise!Upon seeing this, Zhang Ye also felt it was meaningless. There was no need to say anything more. He had already expressed himself using his work. Furthermore, it was a live broadcast, with many listeners listening into it. It was not good for him to say so much, as it was easy to make a mistake with too many words. It would make himself seem agitated. Although anyone could tell that those words were Zhang Ye\u2019s way of fighting back, what he said was without fault. He had admitted to being an amateur and had asked for advice as a newcomer. No one could speak ill of that. Hence, he passed the microphone back to the host and prepared to go offstage.Zhang Huo was actually quite warm-hearted, \u201cTeacher Zhang, although we are in the second poetry appreciation segment, it is still part of the Mid-Autumn Poetry Meet. Your poem will definitely be voted upon by netizens. Do you want to canvass for votes for yourself?\u201dZhang Ye turned around and smiled, \u201cIt\u2019s alright. There\u2019s no need.\u201dNo need to canvass for votes? Meng Dongguo and company had all canvassed for votes, but you don\u2019t need to?Zhang Huo did not understand what Zhang Ye\u2019s attitude was and could only respect his idea.Meng Dongguo, who was below the stage, squinted his eyes slightly upon hearing this. He was not canvassing for votes? It was alright, even if he canvassed for votes. He believed that he was guaranteed to receive first place.There were two reasons. Firstly, he also felt that his poem was very good. He did not believe that his \u201cThoughts of a Rainy Mid-Autumn Night\u201d was in any way inferior to Zhang Ye\u2019s \u201cShuidao Getou\u201d. He felt that it was one of the best Mid-Autumn works that he had created in recent years. Secondly, he had the advantage of time. Meng Dongguo was the first person to recite his poem at the Poetry Meet. It began at 12 noon and ended at 2 P.M. There were two hours, so the longer the program went after your poem was presented, the more people there were to vote for you. There was no dispute. This was also the reason why Meng Dongguo had arranged to be the first to present a poem. As the Beijing Writers\u2019 Association\u2019s Vice President, and a leader of the capital\u2019s poetry industry, he could not even show his face if he got second place for this sort of competition. He and the radio station had at least done their best to make sure that he would be the champion. If not, Meng Dongguo would probably not have participated in it, as it would affect his prestige.But what about Zhang Ye?Now, it was already 1.30 P.M. That was to say, Zhang Ye had barely half an hour left!Even if the netizens and listeners liked his poem and voted for him, how many votes could they cast? It definitely could not exceed the votes for Meng Dongguo. Hence, he believed the championship title was likely in the bag!Other people also shared his thoughts.For example, Big Thunder and Little Red Mushroom had the same thoughts. Although they knew that Zhang Ye\u2019s melody poem was well-written, it had no chance of becoming the champion. It was also quite impossible for him to enter the top three. How many votes could one garner in 20+ minutes? The other people already had more than ten thousand votes. It was already not bad if Zhang Ye could get into the top ten! When the results were out, people would not care about the procedure or that there wasn\u2019t enough voting time. They only looked at the final outcome. When the top three was dominated by people from the Writers\u2019 Association and Zhang Ye was ranked beyond third place, then it was a way for the Writers\u2019 Association team that Meng Dongguo led to save their face!Ah, alright!Your melody poem this time had a lot of literary value to it!We acknowledge that your melody poem was indeed very good!But so what? Aren\u2019t you still ranked behind us? In the end, everyone will still see that you are inferior to us professional Teachers from a professional body like the Writers\u2019 Association!Scholars tended to be more stubborn. There may have been some small conflicts at the beginning, but as the situation worsened, neither side would agree to back down. Anyway, they were going to go forceful on Zhang Ye! This was probably the clash between their orthodox background as Teachers of the Writers\u2019 Association and Zhang Ye, a half-past-six unorthodox \u201camateur\u201d that wrote supernatural stories, fairy tales and poems! They would not give up until they beat the other party into submission!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Everyone was getting more and more excited about the final results of the voting. Right now, the top ten spots are all held by people from the Writers\u2019 Association. Even the next ten spots were scattered with people from there. It was an almost unanimous victory for them. But the breakout of Zhang Ye had put the whole contest into suspense and uncertainty!\u201cTeacher Zhang, you were great!\u201d\u201cGood job! You didn\u2019t embarrass the Literature Channel!\u201d\u201cThose Writers\u2019 Association guys don\u2019t dare to speak up anymore? That\u2019s what they get for showing off! They are all humbled now!\u201d\u201cHaha. Teacher Little Zhang, give me an autograph later; I want it as a memento.\u201dThe Literature Channel were seated in the same area. When Zhang Ye came back to his seat, everyone gave him a thumbs up. Even Tian Bin, Jia Yan and Wu Datao did not dare to make snide remarks. The poem had them in awe, too!Zhao Guozhou, who was originally seated the furthest away, changed his seats with several subordinates and said to Zhang Ye, \u201cLittle Zhang, you have impressed everyone yet again!\u201dZhang Ye replied, \u201cThank you for your acknowledgement, Leader.\u201dZhao Guozhou queried, \u201cWhy did you not canvass for votes?\u201d\u201cThat would be unnecessary, right?\u201d Zhang Ye had felt it wasn\u2019t necessary, \u201cEveryone is not stupid; they all have their own artistic appreciations and if they thought my poem was good, then they will vote for me. If they felt the others were good, they will vote for them. There\u2019s not much meaning to canvassing for votes. It\u2019s not a contest, but an exchange of literary learning. It\u2019s better to keep it simple.\u201d He had said so logically, but self-righteously.Wang Xiaomei said, \u201cYou seem rather relaxed.\u201dZhao Guozhou asked everyone from the Literature Channel, \u201cWhat ranking does everyone think Little Zhang will get? Teacher Xiaomei, what\u2019s your opinion?\u201d\u201cIn my opinion, from just the quality and literary qualities, Teacher Little Zhang would definitely get first. But that\u2019s just my own opinion. We don\u2019t know if the audience has been convinced by it. Vice-President Meng Dongguo\u2019s poem was good, too. Perhaps some will find it to be better. It\u2019s all possible.\u201d Looking at her watch, she said, \u201cBesides, there\u2019s only about 20 minutes left.\u201d\u201c20 minutes?\u201d\u201cAh, yes! The voting will be ending soon!\u201d\u201cAiyo, then there\u2019s no hope; how can we catch up to them!?\u201dEveryone felt a little pity; such an amazing poem appeared, but it could not achieve a good result due to the lack of time!From behind, the Literature Channel\u2019s Big Sis Zhou came back alone. So as to not block the people behind her, she bent over as she squeezed all the way over. \u201cExcuse me. Liu\u2019er, Zhou\u2019er, let me get past.\u201d In a blink of an eye, she was beside Zhang Ye, \u201cEh. Leader, you are here, too?\u201dZhao Guozhou tersely acknowledged, \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d\u201cI pretended to go to the bathroom.\u201d Big Sis Zhou held her cellphone, \u201cActually, I was checking the voting results for Little Zhang. There\u2019s no internet reception in the auditorium and I can only see it outside.\u201dAuntie Sun asked with concern, \u201cSo how was it? How was it?\u201dThe other people from the Literature Channel also tilted their heads over, wishing to know.Big Sis Zhou pointed to her cellphone. There was no more internet connection, but the web page she had opened before could still be seen. \u201cLittle Zhang\u2019s \u2018Shuidiao Getou\u2019 has already caused quite a sensation. Three minutes ago, the website staff had uploaded his poem after he finished reciting it. \u2018Shuidiao Getou\u2019 already has more than 900 votes. Look at their comments. The comments left by the netizens are practically going nuts. It\u2019s almost explosive!\u201dThe cellphone\u2019s screen showed densely packed messages.\u201cGod!\u201d\u201cThis melody poem is invincible!\u201d\u201cCan it not be so powerful?\u201d\u201cWho is Zhang Ye? Why have I never heard of this Teacher?\u201d\u201cDid I hear wrongly? Previously, I thought Meng Dongguo and someone from the Writers\u2019 Association were going to criticize Zhang Ye\u2019s poems? Using him as a negative example? With the melody poem out, why did no one criticize it?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m laughing. I\u2019m really laughing!\u201d\u201cThe Writers\u2019 Association is so hilarious! Their faces are swollen from being smacked!\u201d\u201cHaha. I have always supported Teacher Zhang Ye. Today, I want to see who dares to say that Teacher Zhang Ye doesn\u2019t know how to write poems! From today onwards, I want to see who still dares to say that Teacher Zhang Ye\u2019s works have no literary value!\u201d\u201cTo be going against the Teachers from the Writers\u2019 Association, I can only now express my heartfelt condolences!\u201d\u201cIf a person who can compose a melody poem like \u201cShuidiao Getou\u201d does not know poetry, then the whole f***ing world doesn\u2019t know poetry. Are the people from the Writers\u2019 Association stupid? And a Vice-President at that? I want to ask you now: are you the ones who do not know literature or is it Teacher Zhang Ye who doesn\u2019t know?\u201d\u201cQuickly vote!\u201d\u201cRight, cut the crap. Voting is of utmost urgency. Time is running out!\u201d\u201cTroll army, gather! Although we won\u2019t be able to catch up and we are too far behind, when have we ever been afraid of anyone? We fear no one! Even if an individual is weak, we will contribute that tiny amount of energy to Teacher Zhang Ye! Not for anything else, just because of the spirit of Teacher Zhang Ye\u2019s courage to fight with anyone! We must not fail him!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m here!\u201d\u201cTroll army signing in!\u201d\u201cVote has been cast!\u201d\u201cMy large saber is again again again again again unable to endure the thirst!\u201dZhang Ye\u2019s fans came to support him. There were many others who first got to know about him through the poetry meet, who were touched by \u201cShuidiao Getou\u201d. They all sent in their support!\u2026\u201cJust 900 votes?\u201d Zhao Guozhou frowned.Big Sis Zhou said, \u201cThat happened in an instant. Isn\u2019t that already a lot?\u201d\u201cSis Zhou, what is Little Zhang\u2019s ranking now?\u201d Wang Xiaomei inquired.\u201cBefore I went offline, there were 925 votes, so he was ranked at 41.\u201d Big Sis Zhou spoke for Zhang Ye, \u201cIt may seem low, but that was just in a few minutes. If it increases at that speed, then it would definitely be higher than those people from the Writers\u2019 Association. Little Zhang is too formidable!\u201d41? Zhang Ye was not very satisfied.Aunt Sun sighed, \u201cHai, there\u2019s no way of catching up. There\u2019s no need to think further. The others have accumulated their votes for two hours, while we only had a bit more than 20 minutes. The difference is too large. Besides, the people from the Writers\u2019 Association have fans that number in the hundreds of thousands. How many fans does our Teacher Little Zhang have? His popularity definitely can\u2019t compete with them.\u201dBig Sis Zhou curled her mouth, \u201cBut there is still hope. Many listeners had just heard it and might not have the opportunity to vote yet. There will be more. I believe that Little Zhang will be able to fight for the top ten! No, maybe even the top six is possible!\u201d Holding her cellphone, she said, \u201cLook at this. Other than first-placed Meng Dongguo, who is leading far ahead with 37,000 votes, the ones after him have considerably fewer votes. Sixth place only has 11,000 votes. I think Teacher Little Zhang definitely has the chance of overtaking this! Even if it was any worse, tenth place had 8,500 votes. Even if he didn\u2019t enter top six, there is still chance to enter top ten. I don\u2019t think there is a problem!\u201dAn editor from the Literature Channel said, \u201cEntering the top ten would be enough. At least we can break the monopoly of the members from the Writers\u2019 Association. It will also gain some glory for our channel.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d\u201cMay the Heavens bless you!\u201dEveryone also began to accept the harsh reality.Big Sis Zhou suggested, \u201cI think we should take turns \u2018going to the bathroom\u2019. Let\u2019s go five at a time to help vote for Teacher Little Zhang. The higher Little Zhang\u2019s placing is, the more glory our channel will receive! I have already voted for Little Zhang once just now!\u201d This old sister sure was warm-hearted.Zhang Ye sweated profusely, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to; there\u2019s no need. Thank you everyone, but there\u2019s really no need!\u201dWhat was this poem?This was Su Shi\u2019s poem!This was the famous \u201cShuidiao Getou\u201d!Did he need to rely on his colleagues\u2019 ten or so votes to help pull up his vote count by pretending to go to the bathroom? That would be too drastic a drop in this work\u2019s value. This would be too much. If this was seen by people from his world, they would all be laughing their heads off! Anyway, Zhang Ye would not do something this embarrassing! If people did not appreciate this melody poem, \u201cShuidiao Getou\u201d, then Zhang Ye was also helpless. He was also helpless if the vote count did not increase.Forget it.Let\u2019s resign ourselves to fate.Whatever Zhang Ye could do, he had done. He had also worked hard. Now, to see if Su Shi\u2019s masterpiece was able to reverse the situation and whether it was able to help Zhang Ye trample on the bunch of people from the Writers\u2019 Association and establish his fame. All that he could do was wait. Everything was in the hands of the people to judge!Five minutes\u2026Ten minutes\u2026Time flew. Even if Zhang Ye was looking forward to it and more time was given to him and the listeners, the watch would not stop. Soon, it was already 2 o\u2019clock!\u201cAlright, now the voting has ceased.\u201d Zhang Huo announced, \u201cWe are waiting for the notaries to consolidate the final scores. While they are reviewing it, let us recount the classic poems from before.\u201dWith the recording played, Meng Dongguo, Zheng Anbang and Big Thunder\u2019s poems were replayed once again.Soon, a man and a woman from the Chengdong District\u2019s Notary Office came over with a book. \u201cIt\u2019s done.\u201dThe female host, Sun Mengjie, smiled, \u201cThe comrades from the Notary Office have done the statistics, and I\u2019m dying to know what the results are. I need to first take a look.\u201dShe immediately took a peek at the results.Zhang Huo was also very curious. He also looked at the rankings in the notary\u2019s hand.This look did not matter, but Zhang Huo and Sun Mengjie were completely stunned!Upon seeing the two hosts\u2019 expressions, there was a commotion from offstage. They did not know what had happened, and were even more curious!\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cAre the results too exaggerated?\u201d\u201cCould it be that Vice-President Meng\u2019s votes are leading by too much?\u201dThe female notary held the microphone, \u201cSeptember 8th, from 12:00 to 14:00, Chengdong District notaries Li Hai and Zheng Meihong as supervisors have declared the votes to be fair for this Mid-Autumn Festival Poetry Meet. I will begin to announce the top ten!\u201dZhang Ye listened attentively.Zhao Guozhou, Wang Xiaomei and company stared straight ahead!Meng Dongguo, Big Thunder and company were more relaxed. They felt there was no suspense.\u201cTenth place, Little Red Mushroom. \u2018Auntie Moon\u2019. Vote count: 9,300!\u201d the female notary read.Upon hearing this, Big Thunder congratulated with a smile, \u201cCongratulations. This is a poetry meet, yet a fairy tale writer like you can get into the top ten. This sure shows Teacher Little Red Mushroom\u2019s skill.\u201dLittle Red Mushroom said, \u201cCome on. Don\u2019t flatter me.\u201dThe notary carried on, \u201cNinth place, Big Thunder, \u2018Untitled\u2019. Vote count: 9,800!\u201dLittle Red Mushroom smiled, \u201cSee? You are even better than me. Who said your melody poem was too niche? See, the listeners still recognize it.\u201dBig Thunder waved his hand modestly, \u201cActually, I was not pleased with this melody poem of mine. It doesn\u2019t have my character or mood. A poor response from everyone is also normal.\u201d\u2026\u201cFourth place, Zhou Anyi, \u2018Onlooking the Moon\u2019. Vote count: 16,001!\u201dAt this point, the fourth to tenth places had been read out. All of them were people from the Writers\u2019 Association. Not a single netizen\u2019s poem entered the top ten!\u201cIt\u2019s time for third place!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m so nervous. Who will it be?\u201d\u201cWhy haven\u2019t we heard Zhang Ye\u2019s name?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right; could it be that he took third place?\u201d\u201cIt can\u2019t be that high. He only had twenty minutes of voting time, so it won\u2019t happen.\u201dAs everyone was discussing, the female notary announced third place, \u201cThird place, Zheng Anbang, modern poem, \u2018Feelings of Mid-Autumn\u2019.

Why isn\u2019t there Little Zhang!?\u201dTian Bin said, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to ask. He definitely did not enter the top ten.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a conspiracy! There definitely is a conspiracy!\u201d Big Sis Zhou said angrily, \u201cLittle Zhang did not even enter the top ten? Who would believe it! It\u2019s such a good melody poem!\u201d\u201cHai, it was all for naught in the end.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right; there was too little time, or else this result might be unthinkable!\u201dThe people from the Literature Channel were all feeling a sense of regret. Some sighed, while some refused to accept the outcome!However, when the female notary announced second place, everyone was silenced. It was as if everyone was muted suddenly. There was complete silence!\u201cSecond place, Meng Dongguo, \u2018Thoughts of a Rainy Mid-Autumn Night\u2019. Vote count\u202640,058!\u201dSecond?Meng Dongguo was second?There was an uproar offstage!Meng Dongguo was also shocked. How could it be possible!?Big Thunder and Zheng Anbang looked each other in the eye as a bad premonition hit them!Everyone suddenly had a staggering thought. Meng Dongguo wasn\u2019t first? Then who was first? Who would be the champion for this Mid-Autumn Poetry Meet?The female notary paused for a while before looking and said loudly, \u201cVoted first for this Mid-Autumn Poetry Meet, Zhang Ye! \u2018Shuidiao Getou\u2019! Vote count\u2026\u201d Upon reading up to here, the female notary\u2019s voice also had a tinge of surprise. Actually, she and her colleague had already seen the votes and placings; however, now upon looking at it again, the female notary felt that it was unbelievable. \u201cThe vote count for \u2018Shuidiao Getou\u2019 is\u2026158,600!\u201d150,000?150,000 votes??What the f*** to your fifth granny!Upon hearing this, the audience was completely shocked!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Isn\u2019t this result just shooting out of the universe?\u201d\u201cHow can there be so many!? It isn\u2019t scientific! Really too unscientific!\u201d\u201c150,000? The dozen or so works from the Writers\u2019 Association combined have fewer than Zhang Ye\u2019s votes alone?\u201d\u201cAnd it\u2019s really true! One against ten! Complete victory!\u201d\u201cAll the Teachers from the Writers\u2019 Association combined lost out to him? Holy ****!\u201dToo many people could not believe their ears. It was too unbelievable!More than 150,000 votes? What did this mean? This meant that it was going against the Heavens! Others may not understand this, but how could they, as people from the radio station, not understand? This was because the poetry meet was special and it had an upper limit to the amount of attention it could garner. Every year\u2019s Mid-Autumn Poetry Meet was not broadcast on television; it was just broadcast live through the radio. The year before last\u2019s Hebei province\u2019s Mid-Autumn Poetry Meet had an old man from the Hebei Writers\u2019 Association for its champion. He won weakly with about 23,000 votes. And last year, the champion of the Jinshi Mid-Autumn Poetry Meet was an operatic actor from the Jinshi literary circles. As he had used the moon as his topic and performed an operatic piece, he won with an undisputable 37,000 votes!20,000+!30,000+!Even considering all the previous years, the number of votes the champion garnered had never exceeded 50,000 votes!However, this year, what had happened in the Beijing Mid-Autumn Poetry Meet? Alright, Beijing had more people, so it had greater influence than provinces like Jinshi or Beihe. The Beijing Radio Station\u2019s frequencies provided a greater coverage area than even provinces like Tianjin and Hebei could broadcast to, but it should not have been so ridiculous!150,000?Are you all f***ing pumping stimulants!?And what was most shocking was that \u201cShuidiao Getou\u201d had only about 20 minutes of voting time! It was not even half an hour! 150,000+ votes! This far exceeded everyone\u2019s imagination and beliefs. Hence, no one had thought of this possibility! This was because it was too unreal! But the fact was that Zhang Ye had done it! \u201cShuidiao Getou\u201d had done it! Zhang Ye had used a melody poem that he came up with on the spot to create such a Heaven-defying miracle!No one questioned the authenticity of the votes. Everyone knew this was not a statistical error, as the two notaries were present. They were monitoring the entire process!Big Thunder remained silent!Little Red Mushroom and Zheng Anbang turned sullen!Meng Dongguo choked to the point of not being able to say a word. He moved his lips, but no words could come out from them!Zhang Ye, this person who Meng Dongguo and the Writers\u2019 Association looked down upon and said did not know literature! He had used a single \u201cShuidiao Getou\u201d to smack them all in the face! And it was the type of smacking that slapped them repeatedly! Their faces were really swollen! Meng Dongguo had only obtained 40,000 votes! The ten thousands spot of Zhang Ye\u2019s vote numbers were more than his by 10,000 votes! Zhang Ye\u2019s single vote count exceeded their combined vote count by a lot more! Wasn\u2019t this a smack in the face? Describing it as hanging them on a tree while smacking them wasn\u2019t too much! It was even too light a description!Zhang Ye was an amateur?All of you are the professionals?Meng Dongguo, Big Thunder and company\u2019s ravings were still echoing in their ears. Just thinking of those words, those members from the Writers\u2019 Association who had come with them felt their faces turn green. They had disgraced themselves along with Meng Dongguo! They were completely ashamed! They had been pulled into this for no reason!\u201cWho is the real amatuer?\u201dIt was as if they could see the evening news\u2019 headlines for tonight!Speaking of this, up until now, Big Thunder still did not understand how \u201cShuidiao Getou\u201d managed to garner so many votes. He admitted that this melody poem was extremely well-written, but it shouldn\u2019t be so exaggerated. The commoners also liked it that much? 150,000 votes? About half of those tuning into the Mid-Autumn Poetry Meet had voted for \u201cShuidiao Getou\u201d?Zhang Huo was very relieved, and was most gratified. He was very happy to see this scene. It was time for someone to kill these so-called expert Teachers\u2019 momentum and their unrelenting words. Just because of these expert Teachers\u2019 baseless rhetoric and unrelenting words, how much public controversy had they caused in society over the past few years? Maybe, as Zhang Huo was in the news-reporting business, his philosophy was that as public figures, one had to respect the facts and be proper with their words. If they spoke blindly, then they could mislead the public, causing great harm!Just because of a few words from them, how much criticism did Zhang Ye endure? They nearly ruined an excellent and great poet! If Zhang Ye did not have a good psyche, he would not have been able to create this work today. Zhang Huo firmly believed that if \u201cShuidiao Getou\u201d was killed in its infancy, then it would have been a great loss to the cultural world! The entire People\u2019s Republic would suffer!Thankfully, Zhang Ye had not been disappointed, and was not put down by those words. In fact, he became braver, despite the setbacks. And for this, Zhang Huo gave Zhang Ye a huge thumbs up in his heart!Great!He had really made the Beijing Radio Station proud!Zhang Huo raised his microphone, \u201cLet us congratulate Teacher Zhang Ye in becoming the champion with an overwhelming number of votes for \u2018Shuidiao Getou\u2019! It is well-deserved!\u201dA round of applause exploded!The female host, Sun Mengjie, said, \u201cNext, let\u2019s invite the top three placed Teachers onstage for them to say a few words to our listeners.\u201dBig Sis Zhou laughed, \u201cLittle Zhang, quickly go!\u201d\u201cThey are calling for you. Hurry, hurry!\u201d Aunt Sun urged.Another colleague slapped him on his shoulder, feeling excited for him, \u201cYou sure are awesome! I thought you wouldn\u2019t be able to enter the top ten! In the end, you obtained first place!\u201dZhao Guozhou was also laughing, \u201cHurry up and go, Little Zhang. Say a few words. You deserve this honor.\u201dZhang Ye could only squeeze out and walk towards the stage from the back of the auditorium.When he reached the stage, he saw that Meng Dongguo, who was sitting in the first row, was shaking his hand at the host. He had no intention of going up!Zheng Anbang, who had obtained third place, decided not to go up and embarrass himself once he saw that Vice-President Meng had no intentions of going up. What glory was there with third place? In his opinion, it was shameful and humiliating! Zheng Anbang also shook his hand, indicating to the host that he was not going up onto the stage.Zhang Huo also ignored Meng Dongguo and company as he smiled, \u201cThen let\u2019s invite this meet\u2019s champion, who is also my colleague, Teacher Zhang Ye, to say a few words.\u201dWhat should he say?This fellow, Zhang Ye, was a person who bore grudges. He glanced at Meng Dongguo and company. Although he knew that at this moment, they were full of wounds and scars, he still made it his obligation to add another stab, \u201cActually there\u2019s nothing much to say. I\u2019ll just thank everyone for your support. I am a half-past-six poet and am indeed an amateur. I do not know if my poems have any literary value or if it is art. I have also not considered these while composing this poem. As long as everyone likes it, and everyone acknowledges me, I think it is enough!\u201dWhat was adding fuel to the fire?This was what adding fuel to the fire was!What was rubbing salt in one\u2019s wound?This was f***ing rubbing salt into one\u2019s wound!Below, Meng Dongguo, Big Thunder and company\u2019s faces were flashing red and white. They had never expected this newcomer with surname of Zhang to still be mentioning this thing! He refused to let this go!Zhang Huo was clearly unsatisfied, \u201cTeacher Zhang, please say a few more words.\u201d\u201cYes. From the messages from our listeners, they want to hear you talk about things regarding literature, such as producing works, or for example, the value of literature.\u201d Sun Mengjie added.Really say his thoughts?Zhang Ye could not help but have a headache.He could speak very well and was a broadcast major. All he relied on was his mouth. Since it was his profession, how could he not be able to speak? But this fellow was, most of the time, saying things ad verbatim. It was the same with how he learned in university. If not, he could tease and scold others, which was also what he was good at. But if he had to say something decent, such as speaking seriously about literature, he would be grasping at straws. There was no other way. He did not have the ability.What should he do?And it had to have literary value?Eh. Zhang Ye had a flash of brilliance. I got it!Zhang Ye pondered over it and decided to use the Nobel prize winner from his world,\u00a0Mo Yan\u2018s*, words in his acceptance speech. He nearly recited it ad verbatim, \u201cAlright, then. Then I will seriously repeat myself. I want to thank my family and friends. Their wisdom and friendship shines through my work.\u201dMo Yan\u2019s original words were as such.These words might not mean much to others, but it had a deep meaning for Zhang Ye.Then he carried on Mo Yan\u2019s acceptance speech, \u201cJust now, we talked about the value of literature. My personal understanding of it is actually very simple. In comparison to science, literature indeed has no practical use. Yet the greatest function of literature is perhaps its lack of function.\u201d With a nod, \u201cThank you, everyone. I\u2019ve finished speaking.\u201dUpon hearing this, Meng Dongguo was dumbfounded.Big Thunder and Little Red Mushroom also gave a surprise look at each other!Zhang Huo\u2019s eyes lit up and sighed, \u201cTeacher Zhang Ye keeps saying that he doesn\u2019t know art and is an amateur, but his final words have perfectly revealed what sort of literary quality Teacher Zhang has. This is the most thought-provoking acceptance speech that I have heard in the past few years. Let us once again give a round of applause of Teacher Zhang!\u201dAs people applauded, they were deep in thought.Some people did not understand it, but others could understand a tiny bit!The greatest function of literature is perhaps its lack of function? Those dozen or so Teachers from the Writers\u2019 Association stared at Zhang Ye, who was walking off the stage. This was the first time that they garnered interest in him, a broadcast host who had written \u201cShuidiao Getou\u201d. An \u201camateur\u201d poet who had managed to completely destroy predecessor authors, them! A just over 20-year-old young man who could say such an acceptance speech! The things that Zhang Ye had managed to display were things that they could not ignore!In the middle of the back seat rows.The moment Zhang Ye returned, everyone began to speak!\u201cCongratulations, Teacher Zhang!\u201d an editor said.\u201cYou have made our Literature Channel famous!\u201d Aunt Sun was gratified.\u201cI already said Teacher Little Zhang was formidable. Look at Little Zhang\u2019s words; they are so philosophical. Uh, although I didn\u2019t understand the meaning behind it.\u201d Big Sis Zhou laughed.Wang Xiaomei, who had her eyes closed, opened her eyes and said, \u201cTeacher Little Zhang\u2019s mention of function might be referring to the creative powers in actual life. How it can have considerable influence and effect on this materialistic society. For example, science can build skyscrapers and dams, but literature is unable to have such an effect. However, the biggest function of literature is its lack of function. This meaning of this sentence is that because literature is unable to cause a materialistic effect on other things like other culture, giving the greatest satisfaction from the item, it is not confined to this physical world, but it can have endless sublimation at the spiritual level. It has a pioneering effect on man\u2019s soul. This, then, is its best function. At least, this is how I understand it.\u201d\u201cDeep.\u201d\u201cSo that\u2019s how it is.\u201d\u201cIf not for Teacher Xiaomei\u2019s analysis, I would have never understood it.\u201dActually, Zhang Ye disagreed with Wang Xiaomei\u2019s understanding. The explanation of how literature may appear useless, but actually had a use to it, was completely opposite of what he felt. It was because it was useless that made literature great. This was what he wanted to express, and probably what Mo Yan wanted to express, as well. However, Zhang Ye did not refute this or give an explanation. If you got it, you got it. If you understood a different meaning, then so be it. There was no need to distinguish. It was up to one\u2019s interpretation. If literature was also one equals one, two equals two, A equals A, B equals B, and did not have multiple interpretations, then literature would not be called literature.Zhao Guozhou clearly was very interested in that sentence, \u201cLittle Zhang, your melody poem was well-written, and your acceptance speech was also very well-said. Not only did you exceed others in poetry, you have even exceeded others in the understanding of literature! Rest assured, no one will ever dare to say that you do not know anything about art!\u201dAunt Sun sighed, \u201cLittle Zhang sure is formidable. He can write supernatural novels, fairy tales, modern poems and ancient poems. See, even a simple acceptance speech is enough to shock everyone. Hai, is there anything that you do not know how to do?\u201dZhang Ye hurriedly said, \u201cAll of you are flattering me. I just said those words without thought. It\u2019s not that serious.\u201dThe acceptance speech was well-said?That was definite!Who was Mo Yan? The people from this world may not know, as in this world, no one from the People\u2019s Republic had won the Nobel Prize in Literature. However, Mo Yan was famous in his world. He was a person who really stood at the pinnacle of literature. For a person at the peak, he was a real master, so how could what he said be bad!?A simple acceptance speech had once again made him well-known!Anyway, Zhang Ye had really stolen the show today!*Mo Yan was the recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature for 2012. His real name is Guan Moye, better known by his pen name, Mo Yan, which means \u201cdon\u2019t talk.\u201d The phrase mentioned in this novel was said not according to script, as he had previously declared that he had forgotten the written version (as sent to the Nobel Foundation for publication and subtitling) in his hotel room. His\u00a0given speech\u00a0differs, therefore, in parts to the\u00a0published speech.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They still did not make any attempt to have a conversation with Zhang Ye and were escorted out by the staff. Deputy Station Head Jia was amongst the escorts and when he spotted Zhang Ye, he had a dark expression about him. One look and you would know that he was obviously unhappy.Why?Zhang Ye knew clearly why.Ignoring the matter of Zhang Ye not selling the copyright of \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019 to the station, and ignoring that Deputy Station Head Jia\u2019s relative Jia Yan\u2019s planned program segment was forced out by Zhang Ye, the reason could only be today\u2019s poetry meet. Why were there so many Teachers from the literary circle attending, even though there was no official poetry session? Because of fame. The Leaders of the broadcasting station must have promised Meng Dongguo something; most likely, the promise was of guaranteeing him first place in the contest. Perhaps Meng Dongguo was notified very early on to let him have the preparation time to come up with a poem and in return, he would allow members of the Writers\u2019 Association to join. If it wasn\u2019t for the lure of first place, there wouldn\u2019t be any meaning to competing at all!But an unexpected incident had to happen this time!Zhang Ye had caused an upset by completing an impossible task within 20 minutes and had snatched the trophy for his own! How could Meng Dongguo be happy? How could Deputy Station Head Jia be happy? Indeed, Zhang Ye had brought glory to Beijing Radio Station, putting them in the limelight. Afterall, he was a host at the radio station. But Deputy Station Head Jia did not care about this. He was more concerned about their promise.Zhang Ye could not be bothered to care about it, though!First place belongs to this bro! Wanna bite me?In any case, Deputy Station Head Jia and the Station Leaders were already offended; Zhang Ye could not be bothered anymore. If they didn\u2019t care about him, he was not obliged to care about them. He walked past them and back to his office.\u201cTeacher Zhang is back?\u201d\u201cHaha. Teacher Zhang is too awesome!\u201d\u201cThat melody poem is so good; it makes me so excited just by listening to it!\u201dSeveral colleagues who were not close to him before had now actively joined him.After offending the Station Leader, Zhang Ye was ostracized by the office and he wasn\u2019t well-respected. But after \u201cShuidiao Getou\u201d was born, his popularity increased even a bit more than after his release of \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d. Even though there were still some colleagues who wouldn\u2019t speak with him, they at least treated him with more respect now. After he obtained the coveted first place under so much attention, who would dare to not respect him?\u201cOn the internet, the netizens\u2019 responses were erupting!Zhang Ye flipped through the forums and Weibo and had a shock himself. He had not expected so much support over his injustice!\u201cI will not trust the Writers\u2019 Association anymore!\u201d\u201cRight! From now on, I will only trust Teacher Zhang Ye!\u201d\u201c\u2019The Song of the Stormy Petrel\u2019, \u2018Flying Bird and Fish\u2019, \u2018A Generation\u2019, \u2018See Me or Not\u2019 and those untitled works are all classics amongst classics! They are all great literary works of this world, yet they were s*** upon by Meng Dongguo and the others? Thrashed into worthless, rubbish poems? What is wrong with this world? Can\u2019t they differentiate between right or wrong? That gang of so-called Teachers, are they blind?\u201d\u201cTeacher Zhang Ye has proven his worth today! Let me see who still dares to gossip!\u201dThere were Zhang Ye\u2019s ghost story fans, fans who liked his fairy tales, the troll army who followed his cursing phrases and even more fans who got to know about Zhang Ye through the poetry meet today. They had set up camp to denounce the Writers\u2019 Association\u2019s Meng Dongguo and others. Someone even shouted, \u201cA Vice-President with standards like that should step down quickly.\u201dZhang Ye quickly replied, one by one, thanking them all. He knew that this miracle of garnering 150,000 votes was all because of these supporters. They were the ones who had created this miracle and made Zhang Ye into a legend. Of course he had to thank them!Suddenly, someone @-ed Zhang Ye.It was ZhangYeNumber1Fan. He mentioned on Weibo, \u201cTeacher Zhang, quickly go check Meng Dongguo\u2019s Weibo and Big Thunder\u2019s Weibo. Haha!\u201dWeibo?What has happened now?Zhang Ye trusted this fan of his; he had received a lot of support from this person the past few times that he had met with difficulties. He quickly opened up Meng Dongguo\u2019s Weibo. Oh? There was nothing at all? The Weibo message that had been shared thousands of times that had criticized Zhang Ye\u2019s works for lacking literary value were no longer available. The status of this page was listed as \u201cHas Been Deleted\u201d. And checking on Big Thunder and Little Red Mushroom\u2019s Weibo, the comments that they had shared were no longer available, as well. It was like they\u2019d had a discussion to delete them away.The trolls celebrated their victory!\u201cBrothers, we have again brought down another city wall!\u201d\u201cHaha. This is fun! There\u2019s no failures when we fight alongside Teacher Zhang!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right; our team is getting more and more united, and the spirit is very good!\u201d\u201cCorrect. I suggest that we improve our partnership from now on. When there\u2019s a problem, we will attack together. Just look at how those idiots from the Writers\u2019 Association had to swallow their own words!\u201d\u201cTeacher Zhang is awesome!\u201d\u201cThis \u2018Shuidiao Getou\u2019 is too well-written!\u201dFollowing the deletion of their posts from Weibo, it was clear that Meng Dongguo and the others had retracted their words. For now, this could be considered to be an ending. Zhang Ye used a work of his, used his style beautifully and found a solution to this problem. The people who had been misled earlier on by Meng Dongguo and company also began coming back. Many of them left comments stating that they would renew their support for him. The conclusion of it all was that Meng Dongguo, Big Thunder and the others\u2019 casting of doubt onto Zhang Ye not only did not cause his popularity to drop, it had instead increased his popularity by several times!It was the perfect resolution!It was a perfect reversal!Zhang Ye now took some time off to check on the virtual screen of the game ring. His total Reputation was now over 320,000! And even while he was checking, his Reputation points were visibly piling up nonstop in front of his eyes!+1!+13!+16!It was obvious that people were now paying a lot of attention to him!If we do a count, this was in fact the first time that Zhang Ye\u2019s Reputation points had grown by so much. Even though within them, some of the points came from \u201cGhost Blows Out the Light\u201d and \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d. But mostly, they were brought in by \u201cShuidiao Getou\u201d and all that had happened at today\u2019s Mid-Autumn event. It was really the case of \u2018not opening for business for three years; once opened, it can survive for three years\u2019. He had earned fame and Reputation. Today, he had the best of both worlds. Just the Reputation points now could afford him three lucky draws. If we mention the newspaper reports after today, the Reputation points still had a lot of room to grow!Someone had tried to put him down, but he instead ended up getting popular by the day?Zhang Ye wanted to scream out those words again \u2014 Let the tempest come strike harder!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His mom had called this morning to inform him that he should go to his grandmother\u2019s place. Zhang Ye naturally obeyed, so he went home to the Jiaomen rented apartment, so that he could change into something more presentable.Upon entering the corridor, he coincidentally bumped into Rao Aimin, who was coming out of the elevator.\u201cEh, Auntie Landlady?\u201d Zhang Ye greeted, \u201cWhat have you been doing these days? Why haven\u2019t I seen you? I have pushed the rent through the underside of your door. Did you see it?\u201d\u201cI saw it. Wait up.\u201d Rao Aimin threw the trash bag in her hands into a trash compartment by the door and took the elevator with Zhang Ye. She slanted her eyes at him, \u201cYou sure are good, kid. You became famous once again. You won first place at the Mid-Autumn Poetry Meet just now, right?\u201dZhang Ye said proudly, \u201cJust average.\u201dRao Aimin flicked a ball of thread that had fallen on her arm, \u201cTo think that you accepted the praise I gave you. It is only because those people don\u2019t know anything. Your poem was so sh*tty!\u201dZhang Ye exclaimed, \u201cAh? My poem is sh*tty?\u201d\u201cHow did you compose it? Recite it.\u201d Rao Aimin said.\u201cAlright, then please analyze and tell me where it\u2019s wrong. I really can\u2019t believe it.\u201d Zhang Ye immediately turned offensive. He was thinking, \u201cHow could anyone pick a fault in Su Shi\u2019s most famous work? Isn\u2019t this bull****? Even those people from the Writers\u2019 Association could not say anything, but you can?\u201d He then shook his head as he said deeply, \u201cWhen will the moon be clear and bright\u2026\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that a load of rubbish!? When will it? The 15th day of the 8th month!\u201d Rao Aimin said loudly.Zhang Ye was stunned as he suppressed his speechlessness, \u201cWith a cup of wine in my hand, I ask the clear sky\u2026\u201dRao Aimin interjected, \u201cWhy do you even need to ask the clear sky? There\u2019s no need to ask it. Asking me would do. I already told you; it\u2019s the 15th day of the 8th month!\u201dZhang Ye\u2019s brain was already filled with black lines, \u201c\u2026In the Heavens on this night, I wonder what season it would be?\u201dRao Aimin interrupted once again, \u201cDidn\u2019t I already tell you. Today is the 15th day of the 8th month! Year 2014, the15th day of the 8th month of the Lunar calendar! Do you have no calendar at home?\u201dZhang Ye, \u201c\u2026.%$#@@#@)!&amp;&amp;\u201dRao Aimin showed her venomous tongue once again. This was the first time Zhang Ye had heard such a sharp criticism of the poem. He was momentarily dumbfounded!Your sister!Are you understanding \u201cShuidiao Getou\u201d as something from the children\u2019s show, \u2018A Hundred Thousand Whys\u2019!?Zhang Ye already knew that he could not communicate with the landlady who had not one bit of literary culture, so he immediately went home to change his clothes. If he carried on speaking with the landlady, Zhang Ye believed there were only two outcomes. Either he would be vexed to death, or Su Shi would be vexed to life! However, after giving it some thought, Zhang Ye was hoping that there was someone like her amongst his fans. If a queen with a venomous tongue like Rao Aimin joined in the troll army wars, then she would be an absolute force to be reckoned with. The landlady herself had the power to fight a thousand alone. That was the real battleground for her to show her prowess. Yes, on this point, the landlady was an extremely rare talent!\u20265.30 P.M.The sky was still cloudy and looked like it was about to rain.Zhang Ye came to Liu Li Qiao, where his granny\u2019s house was. This was an old and tiny district. The thing slightly different from his memory was that this tiny district had been repainted, so the houses looked newer. Clearly, this was a change caused by the game ring. It was like a butterfly effect. There were many slight adjustments in this world. Well, it was unknown what changes had happened to his relatives. This was also one of the reasons why he had not dared to come to his granny\u2019s place ever since he had started work. Strictly speaking, this was no longer the world he completely knew, so he was afraid of letting the cat out of the bag.Upstairs.The door was open, but the anti-theft door was still activated. Laughter and chatter from the few cousins could be heard.Zhang Ye opened the anti-theft door and entered. The first thing he saw was his mother and his third aunt, who were cooking in the kitchen, \u201cMom, Third Aunt.\u201dHis Mom smiled, \u201cSon, you are here?\u201dHis Third Aunt smiled, \u201cHeh. Our superstar is here.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean, superstar? I\u2019m just a radio host, so don\u2019t tease me.\u201d Zhang Ye said humbly, before looking towards the sofa, \u201cFirst Uncle, First Aunt, Second Uncle, Third Uncle.\u201d He greeted them one by one. \u201cAll of you are here? Happy Mid-Autumn Festival!\u201d Only his Second Aunt was not here for some unknown reason.\u201cHeh, Little Ye.\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t seen you in a long time.\u201d\u201cQuickly come in and meet your grandparents.\u201dZhang Ye said, \u201cOkay.\u201d and entered the small house. The door was closed. His uncles smoked, while his grandmother did not like the cigarette smell. Opening the door, he gave some nutritional and health supplements that he had bought from the supermarket to his grandparents, \u201cGrandma, Grandpa, happy Mid-Autumn Festival. How are the both of you?\u201dGrandma liked Zhang Ye the most. The moment that she saw him, she urged him to take a seat, \u201cI\u2019m good. My health is good, too. I\u2019ve only been missing you. Why haven\u2019t you come in a month?\u201dGrandpa also doted on Zhang Ye a lot. There was no other way. Although Zhang Ye was a maternal grandson, he was the only boy amongst the younger generation in the house. As old people, they were more traditional and prefered boys, \u201cLittle Ye is busy at work. He just started work, so he can\u2019t keep coming like before.\u201dGrandma asked, \u201cHehe. Why did you buy so much? How much would that cost?\u201dZhang Ye smiled, \u201cIt\u2019s not much. It\u2019s just to honor the two of you, and let you supplement your bodies.\u201d\u201cLook at our Little Ye; he\u2019s so sensible.\u201d Grandma beamed.At this moment, shouts came out from the house. These shouts sounded like larks. They were clear and pleasant.\u201cMy brother is here!\u201d\u201cBro! Let me take a glance!\u201d\u201cThe superstar is here! I need to see him, too!\u201dThe three sisters crowded into the small room.His mother\u2019s family situation was quite interesting. His mother was the eldest sister in the house. She had three younger brothers, who were Zhang Ye\u2019s first, second and third uncles. The three uncles all had daughters as children, which were the three cousins of Zhang Ye.The eldest sister was Cao Dan. She was in her early twenties and was not much younger than Zhang Ye. She was still in college.The second sister was Cao Tong. She was in high school. Her personality was quite frank, like a boy. She was good at making big hoohas.The third sister was Cao Mengmeng. She was in middle school. She was the most mischievous of all. She made a fuss all day and she was not afraid of doing anything.In summary, none of these three girls were easy to deal with.When Zhang Ye saw them, he sighed, \u201cLittle Dan, Little Tong, Mengmeng.\u201dThe eldest sister was considered the quietest amongst the three. She obediently called, \u201cBro.\u201dHis second and third sister were not that particular. Cao Tong slapped Zhang Ye on the shoulder loudly, \u201cWell done, Bro! You became a celebrity after I had not seen you for a few days!\u201dGrandma shot a glance at her, \u201cThis kid\u2026 How can you speak to your older brother in this manner?\u201dCao Mengmeng sank as she held Zhang Ye\u2019s arm while laughing, \u201cAfter hearing what First Aunt said, I specially went on the web to check, and I really found quite a lot of your works. Our school has also publicized \u2018Little Bunnies Be Good\u2019. I only knew that it was written by my Bro yesterday. So awesome. Hehe. Bro, you must have made quite a lot of money? Be honest. The few of us don\u2019t have any allowance left to spend. My parents also aren\u2019t giving me any pocket money. We will be relying on you.\u201dMoney?Hurhur, what sort of question was that!You are my sisters; how can I not give money if you ask?Well, but talking about money hurts feelings, so let\u2019s change the subject!Zhang Ye digressed and chatted about other things with them. First Uncle and Second Uncle also came over and they chatted.After a short exchange and some leading questions, Zhang Ye received quite a good understanding of the present situation. His relatives had not changed too much. However, there were still some differences. For example, his youngest cousin\u2019s school was no longer the middle school from his memories. His eldest cousin had scored tens of points higher for her college entrance exams than in his memory. For example, the working place of his First Uncle and Aunt had changed to somewhere Zhang Ye had no memory of. All of these were considered minor changes. After all, the world had changed to a new world. A lot of cultural industries may change, so it was impossible to not affect his family. After figuring this out, Zhang Ye also dared to speak, and was not too afraid of making mistakes.Even as dinner time approached, everyone was still talking about Zhang Ye.\u201cLittle Ye is so promising.\u201d\u201cLittle Ye, when did you dabble in creative work? Why didn\u2019t I see it before?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right; I\u2019ve never seen this talent of Little Ye in the past. Even if he gained enlightenment, it shouldn\u2019t have been so exaggerated. I heard from Big Sis that Little Ye even wrote poems!\u201dThird Uncle and Aunt had a suspicious tone, but they had no malicious thoughts. They really could not understand. This was because other than Zhang Ye having managed to make the cut for a pretty good university, he was not great in any other aspect. He had been too normal since he was young, hence they had even discussed before that after Zhang Ye graduated, he would at most find a behind-the-scenes job in a radio station or newspaper firm, where he would do the lighting or write documents. No one expected Zhang Ye to find such a well-fitted profession and even manage to sit stably as one of Beijing Radio Station\u2019s broadcasting hosts!His parents did not speak.However, his Mom did not like hearing that and was just about to retort.Suddenly, Second Aunt came home. She held a bag of\u00a0mantou\u00a0in her hands. She had just went to buy food. The moment she entered, she began to chatter. She pulled out two rolls of newspapers that she had held under her arm. \u201cEh. Little Ye, you got off work? Quickly take a look. I just bought the newspaper at the newsstand. Little Ye has made it into the papers. At this afternoon\u2019s whatever Mid-Autumn Poetry Meet, Little Ye had shockingly taken down the professional writers from the Beijing Writers\u2019 Association, getting first!\u201d\u201cEh?\u201d\u201cThere was such a thing?\u201d\u201cQuickly, let me see.\u201d\u201cWhat sort of newspapers? Some tabloid?\u201dEveryone was very surprised.Second Aunt said, \u201cWhat tabloid? It\u2019s the Beijing Evening News. Another is the Beijing Times. They are all big newspapers and each have a great circulation!\u201dZhang Ye tilted his head over and took a glance. He had walked past the newsstands just now, but he did not buy it. He did not think that the afternoon\u2019s events would be reported in time, as the newspaper firms would have prepared manuscripts. So it would never be in time. But who knew that it would come out today? Hence, he also had not seen the specific content.His Third Cousin, Cao Mengmeng, grabbed it, \u201cWow, Bro. You really became famous. I thought it was just some small hooha. I didn\u2019t know that you had become so famous!\u201dThe relatives passed the newspapers around as they surrounded them. Only then did they realize how promising Zhang Ye had become.Grandpa and Grandma were very elated. They praised their grandson for his abilities.Mom\u2019s face was beaming with pride as she began to brag, \u201cThat\u2019s because you don\u2019t know. Little Ye is awesome. Just last time, he used a poem to save a person\u2019s life. A female university student wanted to commit suicide; but after hearing my son\u2019s poem, she immediately did not want to die. The next day, the entire family even brought a banner and made a big hooha at my son\u2019s unit to thank him. Also, that fairy tale that was greatly publicized by the capital, it may seem like an ordinary story, but in fact, it\u2019s nothing ordinary. Back then, when my son posted \u2018Little Bunnies Be Good\u2019, that was a national contest\u2026 That was something that even shocked the Education Ministry. I think it\u2019s even possible for it to be written into elementary school textbooks. And then, there\u2019s the other time\u2026\u201dMom was bragging throughout the entire meal.Zhang Ye blushed while hearing this. He was thinking, \u201cI didn\u2019t realize that I was so kick-ass!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Bro, there will be the Golden Microphone Awards soon!\u201dZhang Ye replied, \u201cI know.\u201dThe Third Cousin immediately said, \u201cI have also heard of it. My idol, Zhang Yuanqi, will be one of the judges this time. I heard from my classmate that this was the first time that the Golden Microphone Awards have invited such a big S-list celebrity to be a judge. Some people are even questioning if my big idol knows about broadcasting and hosting. Ha, what a joke. Don\u2019t they know that Auntie Yuanqi had been a television host many years ago? Furthermore, the program she hosted was very popular. It was only because she went to do music and film movies that she did not further develop herself in the hosting business. If she was not qualified to be a judge, who else is qualified? Keke. With Auntie Yuanqi present, there will definitely be many people watching the awards ceremony this year.\u201dZhang Ye said with surprise, \u201cYou sure know quite a lot.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d Cao Mengmeng smiled. \u201cI\u2019m most infatuated with Zhang Yuanqi.\u201dEldest Cousin Cao Dan looked at Zhang Ye, \u201cThe finalist nominations are almost done, right? Did you get in?\u201dZhang Ye smirked, \u201cGolden Microphone Awards? That has nothing to do with me. I have just started work this past month. To be nominated for the Golden Microphone Awards, one needs to have at least three years of broadcasting experience. I\u2019m still far from the gates.\u201d He did want to get an award and had planned very well. Once he obtained an award and gained experience, he could leave the radio station for a bigger stage to develop himself. However, even if he set his sights high, he had never considered the Golden Microphone Awards. That was the most prestigious broadcasting host award in the country. He would not be able to squeeze into it, even if he broke his head.Cao Dan blinked, \u201cI\u2019m not talking about being nominated for the Golden Microphone Awards; I\u2019m talking about the Silver Microphone Awards.\u201dZhang Ye turned his attention back, \u201cSilver Microphone Awards? What\u2019s that?\u201d If he was not mistaken, his world only had the Golden Microphone Awards. Where did the Silver Microphone Awards come from?\u201cThe Silver Microphone Award is a newcomer award.\u201d Cao Dan might have dreams of entering the entertainment industry, so she knew a bit more. She checked on her cellphone and passed it over, \u201cLook. These are newcomer awards that were specially created for newcomers who have less than three years in the broadcasting industry. Among these, there are ten spots for all the rookie television hosts in the country, while there are ten spots for all the rookie radio hosts in the country. Take a look.\u201d\u201cBro, you are so stupid.\u201d Cao Mengmeng scoffed.Cao Tong was speechless too, \u201cTo think that you are an anchor. You don\u2019t even know this?\u201dGrandma protected her grandson, \u201cDon\u2019t laugh at your brother. Little Ye has just started working for a month.\u201dZhang Ye broke into a sweat. He, of course, did not know of this because his world did not have it. Why was there a specially established award for newcomers? And they were given to ten people? He quickly checked and finally understood. These special Silver Microphone Awards prepared for newcomers were not something to be scoffed at. It was not limited to the capital regions. This award was a national award and meant a lot!Haha!He got whatever he wanted!Zhang Ye felt that he had to get this award, regardless of anything. Wasn\u2019t he waiting for this? Once he had experience on hand, Zhang Ye could have vast oceans of flying fish\u2026 Eh, that\u2019s not right. Vast oceans of jumping birds\u2026 Eh, that\u2019s not right either. High skies\u2026 high skies filled with birds\u2026 Forget it! What a crappy phrase!After teasing Zhang Ye, Cao Mengmeng began talking about her biggest idol. Strictly speaking, Zhang Ye did not belong to this world and there were many changes that he did not know about. But everyone in the family knew of Cao Mengmeng\u2019s hardcore star-chasing, and Zhang Yuanqi was her favourite, \u201cI must go support my Auntie Yuanqi\u2019s new movie. She\u2019s too pretty, so gentle and so very elegant. When I grow up, I want to be as beautiful as someone like Auntie Yuanqi.\u201dThird Aunt smiled, \u201cMy daughter will definitely be beautiful.\u201dRemembering something, Cao Mengmeng glanced toward Zhang Ye, \u201cBrother, you\u2019ve got to work harder. You\u2019re only a small star now, so you have to quickly gain more fame. And when you reach Zhang Yuanqi\u2019s level, you must get an autograph from her for me. That is my biggest wish. Ah, ah. If I had her autograph, that would be so great; my schoolmates would be so envious of me!\u201dZhang Ye rolled his eyes, \u201cWho is a really small star now?\u201d\u201cHeehee. That\u2019s about what you are.\u201d Cao Mengmeng swung her pigtails around saying, \u201cIf you get me Zhang Yuanqi\u2019s autograph, I will admit that you are a famous star and worship you in the future.\u201dZhang Ye deliberately quipped, \u201cIf I can get it? How will you worship me?\u201dCao Mengmeng rolled back her eyes, \u201cGet over it. You can\u2019t even meet Zhang Yuanqi now; how do you expect to get her autograph?\u201d\u201cWho says I can\u2019t get to see her?\u201d Zhang Ye suddenly bragged.Cao Mengmeng stuck out her tongue, \u201cKeep on bragging; like I would believe it.\u201dCao Dan asked, \u201cWhere will our brother get the autograph from? What kind of person is Zhang Yuanqi like? Having bodyguards all around whenever she goes out, even if you were to meet her coincidentally, you would not be able to see her. She\u2019s going to be well-protected.\u201dCao Mengmeng eagerly said, \u201cBrother, I will depend on you anyway!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t give trouble to your bother.\u201d Third Aunt told her daughter. \u201cLittle Ye has just debuted; how do you expect him to get you Zhang Yuanqi\u2019s autograph?\u201dThird Uncle, who had just come back from his smoke break, also said, \u201cLittle Ye, don\u2019t be bothered by her.\u201dZhang Ye laughed, then said to the youngest sister, \u201cDo you really want to have it?\u201d\u201cOf course! I want it, even in my dreams.\u201d Cao Mengmeng was a passionate fan of Zhang Yuanqi\u2019s, \u201cEven if you take away a year of my lifespan, I still want it!\u201d\u201cStop spouting nonsense.\u201d Grandma lightly nudged her head.Cao Mengmeng clutched her head and said, \u201cBut it\u2019s true; I am Auntie Yuanqi\u2019s hardcore fan!\u201dZhang Ye and his Mom, along with their few aunties, were all tickled by Cao Mengmeng\u2019s antics.Zhang Ye then mysteriously said, \u201cSure. Wait for me a little, then. I will go to the bathroom.\u201d In the toilet, Zhang Ye flipped through his wallet and took out a piece of paper. Did he have Zhang Yuanqi\u2019s autograph? He really did have it. It was from the other time when Zhang Yuanqi left the note to him before leaving his house. On it was written, \u201cI\u2019ve saved your phone number; the same goes for your unit number. I\u2019ve forgotten yesterday\u2019s incident; I guess you have, too.\u201d in some sort of threatening tone.Sign off:\u2014 Zhang Yuanqi.Zhang Ye cleared his throat, tore off the top part of the note, and kept the signature intact. He then grasped it in his hand and walked outside.Outside the house.Cao Mengmeng was still jumping around, expressing her love for Zhang Yuanqi, \u201cThe other time when the concert ended, I was just 100 metres away from her; a hundred metres! I hate myself for not having the courage to rush up! Then, maybe I would have gotten an autograph from her! It\u2019s my biggest regret! I hate it!\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Cao Dan said in frustration.Cao Tong tousled her little sister\u2019s hair, \u201cHaha. There will be chances in the future.\u201dActually, Cao Dan and Cao Tong were also very into Zhang Yuanqi. They were just not at the level of crazy, like their third sister was.Zhang Ye came over and nudged Cao Mengmeng with his arm, then opened his fisted hand and said, \u201cTake it.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Cao Mengmeng not understanding the situation, \u201cDid you use this in the toilet? Aiya, brother; that\u2019s too dirty!\u201dZhang Ye nearly fainted, \u201cIt\u2019s not toilet paper! Take a clearer look. You don\u2019t know how good I am.\u201d\u201cLet me see; what\u2019s this mysterious thing?\u201d Cao Tong grabbed it, opened the note and gave out a scream, \u201cAhh! This can\u2019t be?\u201dCao Mengmeng\u2019s curiosity was aroused. She immediately jumped up, \u201cShow it to me! Show it to me!\u201dCao Tong handed the note to Cao Mengmeng, dumbfounded, \u201cYou should prepare yourself for this!\u201dCao Mengmeng casually took it from her, but when she saw the writing on it, it sent a shiver down her spine. Her little voice suddenly shouted, \u201cOH, MY GOD! God! Zhang Yuanqi\u2019s autograph! Autograph!\u201dThe entire family was startled.\u201cIs that true?\u201d\u201cZhang Yuanqi\u2019s autograph?\u201d\u201cLittle Ye, how did you get it?\u201dEven though the adults don\u2019t follow any stars, they still knew Zhang Yuanqi well!\u201cDid brother go to the toilet and forge this autograph?\u201d Cao Tong asked cautiously after recovering from the shock. She immediately launched her mobile internet browser to search for Zhang Yuanqi\u2019s autograph to verify it!Cao Mengmeng and the others gathered around to see!The truth was revealed; it was exactly the same!This was really Zhang Yuanqi\u2019s signature!Cao Mengmeng nearly went mad, running around the house while holding the note in both hands. She shouted while doing this, \u201cI have it now! I have it now!\u201dZhang Ye \u201c\u2026Be quiet.\u201d\u201cMy schoolmates are gonna be so jealous of me! I want to frame it! I want to frame it against the wall and place it above my bed forever!\u201d Cao Mengmeng was ecstatic for a long while, before she remembered about Zhang Ye. She pounced on him, \u201cBrother! I love you! I really, really love you!\u201dZhang Ye patted her back, pretending to despise her, \u201cGet down. Down!\u201dCao Mengmeng held on tightly, \u201cYou actually got it. How did you get it?\u201d\u201cI have my ways. But it\u2019s a secret, so I won\u2019t tell.\u201d Zhang Ye could still be stern when he wanted to be stern. \u201cKeep it well.\u201dCao Tong stared, \u201cBrother, I want it, too!\u201dCao Dan also embarrassedly looked at Zhang Ye, \u201cI would like one, too.\u201dZhang Ye was in cold sweat, \u201cI\u2019ve only got one; let\u2019s talk about it later.\u201d\u201cBrother, you are biased. You gave it to Mengmeng, but not to us.\u201d Cao Tong held out her hand in a tantrum, \u201cI don\u2019t care. I want it anyway; you just get it for us!\u201d\u201cNext time, next time.\u201d Zhang Ye said dismissively.The autograph was handed around for everyone to take a look at it. Cao Mengmeng looked on, unwillingly. Whenever it was passed onto another person, her eyes followed closely, afraid they would damage it.Having gotten this autograph, Zhang Ye was looked upon in a different light by his family. He actually managed to get his hands on Zhang Yuanqi\u2019s autograph? They only had the sudden realisation now; Zhang Ye was no longer the silly boy who could not achieve anything!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In his rented apartment of about 30 square meters, Zhang Ye was preparing for something very important \u2013 the Lucky Draw.At this moment, his total Reputation had reached an alarming 630,000. It had accumulated 100,000 points from before, from the broadcasts of \u201cGhost Blows Out the Light\u201d and \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d over the past few days, as well as more from the fans gained from Weibo\u2019s \u201cSee Me or Not\u201d poem, and \u201cShuidiao Getou\u201d from the live broadcast of the Mid-Autumn Poetry Meet. Also, there was the popularity that Zhang Ye had received from yesterday\u2019s Beijing Evening News and Beijing Times. It was as if flowers were blooming from all directions. Hence, his Reputation had reached an unprecedented large number with all these aspects. Counting it, Zhang Ye had really never obtained so many Reputation points before. He felt like a nouveau rich!It was so addicting!It could be said that his hard work had paid off!Zhang Ye forgot about his pressures and took a deep breath. Then he went to the bathroom and used some soap to wash his hands three times before sitting down on his bed \u2014 He was always this superstitious.The game\u2019s interface appeared.[ Inventory ]: Currently empty.[ Merchant Shop ]: Only \"Memory Search Capsule\"[ Lottery ]: There was only this method left to obtain new items.Zhang Ye used his heavily scented hands to tap open the Lottery screen and chose to purchase the chance at the Lottery once. After he made the confirmation, the wheel began to spin. The drawing had begun!Stats Category\u2026Consumption Category\u2026Skills Category\u2026Special Category\u2026The needle slipped past one after another!About ten seconds later, the needle began to slow down!Zhang Ye had previously had great luck when he had obtained a Special Category prize. He did not have any extravagant wishes, as the probability of it happening again so soon was too low. This time, he was hoping to obtain a Stats Category or Skills Category prize. It was because he had still not seen what sort of items there were in these two categories. He had no concept of it, so he naturally anticipated it. He also wanted to be familiar with the game ring\u2019s usage and effects as soon as possible. For example, what was a Skills Category item? For example, there were parentheses at the end of the Treasure Chest, within which was written \u201cSmall0\u201d. Was there a Treasure Chest (Medium) or Treasure Chest (Large)? How was it opened? Or did he need to level up? Will there only be this feature in the future? Zhang Ye did not understand any of these.The increase in his popularity depended on it. The Unlucky Sticker, the Memory Search Capsule, etc. had all given him a wondrous boost for his career. Even the modification of the world\u2019s background was all due to the game ring. It was only this that allowed Zhang Ye to use unknown literary works to appear so divine. For such an important thing that he relied upon, he had to research it thoroughly. He had great goals. He would not be satisfied with an average life.As he was thinking this, the needle had stopped!Seeing the needle point to a stop, Zhang Ye was a bit depressed. Your sister. Why is it still a Consumption Category? Even if this category accounted for a 50% probability, it shouldn\u2019t happen all the time!Zhang Ye obtained another Consumption Category\u2019s Treasure Chest (Small). He helplessly took it out and opened the lid. Actually, Zhang Ye no longer looked forward to the Consumption Category, as he had obtained it too many times. However, when he opened the Treasure Chest and saw the item inside and its introduction, he could not help but be pleasantly surprised![ Lucky Bread ].The item's introduction: Effective once eaten. Increases the player's Luck stat for five minutes.Adding luck? This was a good item! Zhang Ye had clearly not used it before; however, he had used the \u201cUnlucky Sticker\u201d and the \u201cUnlucky Halo\u201d. These items were things that had bad luck effects. From those two items, he could also see what effect that the Lucky Bread would have. It definitely would not be terrible!Zhang Ye finally laughed. He carefully kept the Lucky Bread, and then opened up the Lottery interface once again. He still had 500,000 Reputation points, and could still draw another five times. However, to be safe, he would leave 100,000 Reputation points unused. He needed to ensure that he could obtain knowledge he could not remember clearly when there was a need. For him to want to become a celebrity, a celebrity more popular than Zhang Yuanqi, it was important for him to be careful.There were still four more chances!Zhang Ye chose the Lottery once again, and then confirmed his purchase!The needle moved. Zhang Ye stared at the turntable, without blinking. Maybe it was because he looked at it so seriously, but Zhang Ye was suddenly shocked. He noticed that there was an option that he had never seen before on the turntable. As there were too many categories, and there were all sorts of color zones and the needle, the turntable was too complicated. It had distracted a lot of his attention, so Zhang Ye had only discovered it at this time. The option was very small, and was at the rightmost corner of the turntable.[ Additional Stakes ].These two words did not have any other introduction.Zhang Ye hesitated for a while, before he tapped it.Pa! A window popped out. At the same time, the needle stopped in its place and did not carry on moving. There were only six words on the screen.Adding Stakes Or Not?\"Yes\" or \"No\".Zhang Ye was of a mind to try it for research purposes, so he chose \u201cYes\u201d. Following that, his remaining Reputation points and more options appeared.Select Additional Stakes Quantity.The default was \u201c1\u201d, and there was an up and down arrow beside it. He could add more stakes.Zhang Ye hesitated for a long time. With a ruthless determination, he decided to add an additional three more stakes. He reserved 100,000 Reputation points. This was the largest number of stakes that he could add. Every additional stake cost 100,000 points.With the three additional stakes bought, his Reputation immediately became 130,000.Following that, the interface bounced and returned back to the turntable interface from before.The needle continued moving. It did not begin from the beginning. It was in the previous state as before. Its momentum was slowly decreasing and was closing in on the Stats Category!Stop!Stop, please!Zhang Ye only wished that he could use his hand to pull the needle over!Maybe it was because the Heavens had heard his call. As the needle carried on moving, it began to close in on the Stats Category at the final moment. It had hit the zone by just a millimeter difference! Finally, he had obtained the Stats Category that he had never obtained before, just what he had wished for. Zhang Ye was greatly anticipating it!The Treasure Chest appeared. It was still the same old Treasure Chest (Small).However, different from before, there were four Treasure Chests (Small)!This was the effect of adding stakes? Drawing from the Lottery was one stake. With three Additional Stakes, there were four Treasure Chests?Zhang Ye rushed to take out all the Treasure Chests. He used his left hand to open a lid, and the result greatly surprised him!Fruit of Charm (Eye)!Fruit of Charm (Eye)!And still Fruit of Charm (Eye)!The four Treasure Chests opened the same Stats Category item!So this was the meaning of Additional Stakes! It was the same as buying lottery tickets. Additional Stakes meant doubling, tripling or more!Understanding this effect, Zhang Ye believed this Additional Stakes option would definitely aid him greatly in the future. As he had added his stakes when the wheel was almost stopping, yet it carried on. That meant that whenever Zhang Ye wanted a particular category\u2019s item, he could watch the needle and wait until it was about to stop at the category he needed, then begin adding stakes. By buying Additional Stakes, he could then obtain many of the category\u2019s awards that he needed, all at once!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 66": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I\u2019m Really a SuperstarCH 65Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 65: The Amazing Effects of the Fruit of Charm!He now had an understanding of the Additional Stakes.Looking at the item\u2019s introduction, Zhang Ye was overjoyed.[ Fruit of Charm (Eye) ]: Permanently effective once eaten. Increases the player's charm stat (Eyes). Can be unlimitedly stacked.Only for the eyes? Could there be other Fruit of Charms for other parts?So this was the Stats Category award! No wonder the chances of getting it were so low!It was completely different from the one-time Consumption Category items! This was a permanent effect item!And looking at the description, it could be stacked an unlimited number of times? This meant that he could eat as many of these permanent effect fruits as he could get his hands on?Zhang Ye finished his Lottery draw. He had spent most of his points, so he had no intention of drawing again. He immediately placed the four Fruits of Charm on a desk. The fruits were not big; they were about the size of a fist. It was in a shape that Zhang Ye had never seen before. The fruits\u2019 skin were deep purple in color, and its surface was pitted with potholes; however, it had a magical charm to it that made it very beautiful. On the stalk, there was even a few green small leaves that exuded an aromatic fragrance.Let\u2019s eat!Don\u2019t believe in advertisements, believe in effectiveness!There was a mirror in front of the desk. Zhang Ye prepared himself, holding up a Fruit of Charm in his hand. He took a bite with excited and mixed emotions!Poof!Even the aroma splattered out!Zhang Ye uncontrollably closed his eyes. He swore that this was the most delicious fruit that he had ever tasted. Sweet and creamy, mellow tasting, overflowing with fragrance, full of fat, but not greasy, melts in the mouth, with a lingering taste\u2026.. Forget it, I\u2019m not gonna exaggerate. Actually, the taste was just so-so, but if it were not exaggerated, how else could the specialness of the item be expressed? When you watch TV, those cuisine programs\u2019 food critics\u2026 Are they not the same? They easily say it melts in the mouth every now and then. Zhang Ye could never understand it in the past. Your sister! A piece of lousy jackass barbecued meat\u2026 How the heck could it melt in the mouth!? Did you think you were eating\u00a0Dove? Zhang Ye could understand now why barbecued jackass meat could even melt in the mouth on TV \u2014 Because this would make it seem f***ing awesome!All the fruits had been eaten!Everything had been stuffed into his stomach!Rumble, rumble. He felt his throat pulsating. The next moment, Zhang Ye had a surprise. He could only feel a very special, magical feeling. Something that was indescribable. Something very, very special; it was a feeling that could not be held in!Could it be so magical?Yes, it was just that magical!Right. And so Zhang Ye rushed to the toilet for his small business. After flushing, the magical feeling had disappeared.Alright, not kidding anymore. Let\u2019s go back to before the writing table. Zhang Ye was looking into the mirror at himself and he really discovered that there was something different!His eyes had a burning sensation and he couldn\u2019t keep them open!He could feel this burning sensation all around his eyes for over half a minute!Only after Zhang Ye returned to his normal condition did he open his eyes. His reflection in the mirror gave him a little bit of a shock. This\u2026. His eyes were like\u2026.Were like they were unchanged!Or maybe it changed!The unchanged parts were the eye contours and its appearance, which was still like before, not too big and not too small, with a single eyelid. However, the spirit seemed to have changed. Originally, there was nothing special about his eyes. Now, there seemed to be an air of quality and depth, but it was not too obvious.Seeing this, Zhang Ye\u2019s spirit rose. He excitedly grabbed all the remaining fruits and ate them!One!Two!Three!Everything had been eaten!Fruit of Charm (Eye)! Effective.Player's Charm state (Eye) permanently effective.After bearing with the burning sensation with each fruit, Zhang Ye finally rubbed his eyes and looked into the mirror. He got a fright from looking at himself!Is this still me?How did I become so charming!Could it be a delusion? Was this a placebo effect?Zhang Ye was really confused, which caused him to question the results. Seeing that lunch time was almost here, he decided not to eat instant noodles. He went out to a restaurant to eat\u00a0Lamian.Going out.Taking the elevator.Inside the elevator, there were two 18-year-old female students who lived upstairs.Seeing Zhang Ye enter, one of the girls with a ponytail did not respond. She gave a glance before looking back down at her cellphone. The other girl, who wore spectacles, paused her gaze on Zhang Ye for an additional second. Only when Zhang Ye\u2019s eyes met hers did the bespectacled girl quickly pull away her gaze. When the elevator almost reached the first floor, Zhang Ye could see from the corner of his eyes that the bespectacled girl had glanced at him again. When the elevator stopped and opened its door, the first girl went out, while the bespectacled girl took a third glance at Zhang Ye. This glance was very fast, before the two of them briskly walked away.Were there flowers on my face?Or was my face stained with something?Zhang Ye was unsure. As he used his cellphone\u2019s front camera as a mirror, he realized that there was nothing unusual. The girl had definitely not looked at him because of that!Coming out of the small district, Zhang Ye walked towards the Lamian restaurant.On the way, people still ignored Zhang Ye. This was something that Zhang Ye was already used to.However, as he walked, a 27-year-old older sister who wore a long skirt noticed Zhang Ye. She looked at him and her gaze paused on Zhang Ye\u2019s face for three full seconds, before taking her gaze off him as they brushed past each other.He reached the Lamian restaurant.Zhang Ye found a seat with air-conditioning, \u201cA bowl of Lamian, a big bowl.\u201d\u201cDo you want to add meat?\u201d A female waitress came over.\u201cThere is no need to add meat. Add more chilli peppers. Thank you.\u201d Zhang Ye smiled.The waitress took a look at his eyes, \u201cAlright, please wait a moment. It will be served shortly.\u201dIn three minutes, the 18-year-old waitress brought the Lamian over, \u201cIt\u2019s ready.\u201dZhang Ye lifted his chopsticks and began eating. He noticed that there were four pieces of meat in the Lamian. He had frequently eaten in this Lamian restaurant before. He had always been thrifty and never added meat, hence there would always be at most two pieces of meat in the bowl. But there were actually four pieces today? He had said not to add meat!Now, it was still 11 o\u2019clock. There was still some time before the lunch hour, so there weren\u2019t many people here.Soon, the waitress came over again and began chatting with Zhang Ye, \u201cDo you come here often for your meals? I find you familiar.\u201dZhang Ye replied, \u201cAh, yes. I\u2019ve come here a few times.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you working today? Why did you come here so early for lunch?\u201d the waitress asked.The two of them had some idle chatter until a person behind called out to her. The waitress then busied herself.After finishing his meal and coming out of the Lamian restaurant, Zhang Ye looked up into the sky and had the impulse to cry out!People on the street look at me? He got special treatment when eating noodles? The waitress even took the initiative to chat with him? This was something that had never happened in the past, and was something that Zhang Ye had not even dared to think of!The Fruit of Charm was indeed effective!This was not a delusion of his! It was not a placebo effect! It had really worked!Although there were only a few special cases and most people had not changed his attitude towards him, this was still Zhang Ye\u2019s first time experiencing this. He had never encountered special treatment before! Previously, he would often envy handsome hunks, where they would be given special attention or would be stared at. People would hit on them for telephone numbers, while no one paid him any attention. Ignoring the possibility of having additional pieces of meat in his Lamian, just not having his meat reduced would be something to be thankful for! And now that Zhang Ye had a tiny experience of such treatment, it would be weird if he wasn\u2019t happy!He had reversed his situation!He had seen hope!At this moment, he wanted to sing a song, \u201cArise! All who refuse to be slaves!*\u201dBut what was the principle behind the Fruit of Charm? How did it cause the change?Actually, charm was something hard to explain. Some people had average looks without any attractiveness. However, there were people with average looks, who exuded a lot of charm. Zhang Ye understood that it was a combination of one\u2019s facial features and also the nourishment of one\u2019s experience. If one gained self-confidence, then it would result in a different air. For example, some celebrities did not look eye-catching in photos when they were young. Some could even be said to be ugly. But as they grew older and their career began to thrive, they somehow became more handsome or beautiful. Zhang Ye might currently be in such a situation. His looks were very average, and there was not anything outstanding about his eyes; however, after eating four Fruits of Charm (Eyes), the change in his eyes had become very obvious!He was still the same person. While his eyes were still the same eyes, the feelings they produced in others were completely different!The feedback he got from coming out to eat lunch had let Zhang Ye confirm this!With the result from the test out, Zhang Ye was unsure what he himself was feeling either. This bro can have such a day? This bro can also become good-looking and be full of charm? He had always been helpless with his looks. They were given to him by his parents and it was natural. There was no other way. However, now that there was an opportunity for Zhang Ye to reverse this situation? This discovery made him extremely excited. He would no longer be obscure again! He could still be saved!The world had such an attitude to people of his looks!People differentiated one\u2019s looks into different grades!In this objective environment, Zhang Ye felt that he had no other way out. Especially his goal of becoming a world-renowned superstar, the requirement for looks was even higher. Now, Zhang Ye had seen some hope. This was the best reward he had gained from the Lottery!His looks could not change!But his charm could change! Charm could be increased!Now, just four Fruits of Charm had given him such a significant change. If Zhang Ye were to eat a hundred pieces\u2026no, a thousand pieces, or even ten thousand pieces of Fruits of Charm, what sort of situation and concept would that result in? Could he charm the entire world with just one look? Zhang Ye did not know, but he was greatly looking forward to it. After all, the Stats Category\u2019s Fruit of Charm could be infinitely stacked. As long as he had the Reputation points, then as long as he gained the purchasing privilege of buying this sort of Fruit of Charm in the Special Category, then he could eat an unlimited number of them! When that happened, then would he need to work so hard in his unit, tiring himself to death just to increase his visibility and fame? He just needed to casually sing a song or film a movie; wouldn\u2019t his fan numbers increase with just a smile with his eyes? Just thinking of it made him excited!What was the highest realm a celebrity could reach?It was not working desperately to have a good piece of work and heavily promoting it to draw in numerous fans!It was having fans stream towards him and increasing in numbers with him just standing there without moving! He did not need to work at all! Completely using charm!*The lyrics are from the national anthem of the People\u2019s Republic of China,\u00a0March of the Volunteers.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He opened his eyes and grabbed around with his hand stretched out, before pulling the cellphone to his ear, \u201cHello. How are you?\u201d\u201cIs this Teacher Zhang Ye?\u201d It was a middle-aged man\u2019s voice.Zhang Ye had never heard this voice as he said with his eyes closed, \u201cThat\u2019s me. May I know who you are?\u201dThe middle-aged man\u2019s laughter rang, \u201cTeacher Little Zhang, are you still sleeping? Should I call again later? So as not to affect your rest.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright. May I know who are you?\u201d Zhang Ye asked.The middle-aged man said, \u201cMy name is Hu Fei. We have previously had some interaction on Weibo. I\u2019m not sure if you still remember me.\u201dHu Fei? Who was that? Eh, wait a moment! Interaction on Weibo? Was it that famous producer, Teacher Hu Fei, from Central TV? Zhang Ye was immediately jolted awake. He sat up with his eyes opened wide. Of course he knew the name. Firstly, Hu Fei was quite famous in the industry. And secondly, when \u201cGhost Blows Out the Light\u201d was released, he was the first big wig Weibo account to publicly praise Zhang Ye. He remembered very clearly that Hu Fei had supported him when his poems were posted on Weibo. He had even posted a very long Weibo message that gave him endless praises.\u201cHello, Teacher Hu.\u201d Zhang Ye hurriedly said, \u201cHow do you know my telephone number?\u201dHu Fei said, \u201cFinding your telephone number sure wasn\u2019t easy. I have managed to get it thanks to someone from the Beijing Broadcasting Television Station. With their connections, they could get the telephone numbers from your radio station\u2019s anchors.\u201d The Beijing Television Station and the Beijing Radio Station had merged a long time ago. They were interlinked and had a common system, \u201cYou may not know that I have already left Central TV. My Weibo verification has already changed to Former Central TV Program Producer. I can tell you some things in advance. Shortly, I will be working at the Beijing Television Station and will be doing my old business of program production.\u201dLeft?He had job-hopped to Beijing Television Station?Zhang Ye did not understand, \u201cEh, and you are calling me because\u2026?\u201dHu Fei laughed, \u201cEver since you began \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019, which was recommended to me by a colleague, I have begun taking note of you. I have read all of your modern poems. They are very good; they are so good that I\u2019m speechless. Of course, the reason why I am making this determined decision to call you is because of the \u2018Shuidiao Getou\u2019 that you wrote. I never expected your ancient poetry literacy to be so outstanding. That melody poem had given me goose bumps after I finished hearing it. Hence, I came looking for you. Although my program hasn\u2019t been decided, and I am still negotiating with the Beijing Television Station about the program matters, I still want to invite you in advance. How about it, Teacher Little Zhang? Are you interested in coming over to the television station to develop yourself?\u201dZhang Ye was stunned with surprise, \u201cMe?\u201d\u201cYes. I am new, so I need my own team. If my team has a talented person like you, it would be my honor.\u201d Hu Fei appeared very polite.Zhang Ye said unsurely, \u201cCan I ask if I will be working front-stage or back-stage?\u201d\u201cI was attracted by your front-stage work, so of course I want you to work front-stage.\u201d Hu Fei said.\u201cHowever, my appearance might be off the mark. I\u2019m not sure if you have previously seen my profile.\u201d Zhang Ye was afraid that he would go back on his word in the future, so he gave him a heads up.Hu Fei laughed upon hearing this, \u201cI have seen your photo from the Beijing Television Station\u2019s system. Your image might not be considered good, but you are also not ugly. You have decent features. Well, you might not know what sort of program category mine would be. It would be alright for me to divulge this to you. We have preliminarily decided on a cultural knowledge segment. Hence, we do not have very stringent requirements on the host\u2019s and guests\u2019 looks. If you come, I can arrange for you to be a host or arrange for you to be a long-term guest in the segment. This still has some room for discussion until we really decide on the program.\u201dZhang Ye took two deep breaths, as he was lost for words, \u201cThis\u2026\u201d\u201cHow about it?\u201d Hu Fei invited him again, \u201cAre you interested in helping me? Being a television host or guest would definitely be a challenge for you. However, if you want to go further in the future, it is something that you need to go through. It will definitely be better than developing yourself at the radio station. You should consider it.\u201dZhang Ye immediately said, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to consider. Teacher Hu, I\u2019m going!\u201dHu Fei nodded, \u201cAlright, but I have a tiny request on my side. You are, after all, lacking in experience and have just entered the industry for a month, so I hope you can understand this.\u201dZhang Ye said, \u201cPlease say it.\u201dHu Fei explained, \u201cIt\u2019s this. The Silver Microphone Awards are entering the nomination period soon. I want you to win this award, so that your resume will look better. With that, the pressure on my side will be much less. Although I am pulling you over for my segment, a lot of things are decided by upper management. I\u2019m not questioning your ability. But due to your experience and lack of any official acknowledgement, the television station will not let a rookie like you who has no experience in television hosting come over. I will definitely need to show a lot of papers just to convince them. For this, I hope you can understand.\u201dZhang Ye certainly understood, \u201cI understand.\u201dHu Fei said, \u201cThis award should not be a big problem for you. With your current ratings there, if you can raise your ratings further and get the recommendation from the radio station, it would not be difficult to do. When you get a Silver Microphone Award, my program will be approved, and then I can immediately recommend you to my superiors for the position of host or long-term guest.Zhang Ye said, \u201cThank you for Teacher Hu\u2019s trust.\u201d\u201cYour works have touched me. If we can work together, I believe the segment will gain pretty good ratings. When that happens, it will be me thanking you. Hur Hur.\u201d Hu Fei did not have any airs of a famous Program Producer. He spoke very nicely.The phone was hung up.Zhang Ye threw his cellphone on the bed as he rubbed his head and slapped his face. It felt like he was in a dream! Great! The television station had invited him! He had not worked so hard for the past few days in vain! He had finally gained the attention of people in the industry! He immediately picked up his cellphone, intending to make a phone call to his parents to tell them about the good news. The radio station was just his springboard. The television station was really the stage that Zhang Ye would be satisfied with. How could he not be excited? However, just as he called out, Zhang Ye gave some thought before quickly hanging up. Not yet; it was still too early!Someone had just held out an olive branch to him. The future had not been decided yet!He had also put forward a condition that had not been reached, which was winning a Silver Microphone Award!From Hu Fei\u2019s words, Zhang Ye could tell that if he didn\u2019t win the award, he would definitely not be accepted. Which television station would dare to hire a fresh graduate, who had worked for a month with no service of records or television experience, as a long-term guest or host? Hu Fei appreciated him, but Hu Fei was unable to make the decisions for certain things. The only way was for Zhang Ye to live up to his expectations!He needed to get the award!Zhang Ye felt an imperative. He definitely could not lose in competing for a Silver Microphone Award, regardless of any unexpected situations!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After he washed up, he left home. Today, he was again the first to reach the unit. After he retrieved the keys from the door keeper\u2019s room, he rushed straight to the recording studios.He wanted to record programs.And he intended to record a few episodes.After squeezing in some\u00a0xiaolongbao, which he bought from the streets, into his stomach, Zhang Ye began to narrate \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d as he ate. He wanted to organize the plot. For example, the ending part of each chapter and the crucial plot\u2019s position. He was not changing the text or the plot, nor could Zhang Ye change it. He would not change anything about the story, but he could arrange where he would end the segment every day. He did not follow the exact chapter format of \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d to the tee. For example, he was ending the program today at a part that made people anticipate. With people\u2019s anticipation hooked, the listenership rating tomorrow could be slightly higher. These were all strategic methods.Why did he go through all this trouble?It was because Zhang Ye was trying to pull up his listenership ratings!His current \u201cOld and Young Story Club\u201d listenership ratings were approximately 2.4% or so. It was second in the Literature Channel. If it went any higher, then he could break a few records. That would be extremely helpful for him in winning a Silver Microphone Award. Then, it would be quite certain that he could win the prize.\u201cChapter 9: The Queen of the Field Mice.\u201d\u201c\u2018We cannot be far from the road of yellow brick, now.\u2019 remarked the Scarecrow, as he stood beside the girl, \u2018for we have come nearly as far as the river carried us away.\u2019 The Tin Woodsman was about to reply, when he heard a low growl. Turning his head, he saw a strange beast come bounding over the grass towards them.\u201d\u20269:30 A.M.His colleagues had already begun work for half an hour.Zhao Guozhou\u2019s image had changed today. He had permed his hair. He held out the ratings table as usual, \u201cStop the things that you are doing for a moment. Is everyone here?\u201dTian Bin looked towards an empty seat, \u201cZhang Ye isn\u2019t here.\u201dZhao Guozhou frowned, \u201cHe isn\u2019t here yet? What time is it already?\u201dBig Sis Zhou spoke out for Zhang Ye, \u201cLittle Zhang must have been too tired over the past few days, so he\u2019s a bit late. I\u2019ll give him a call.\u201d She took out her cellphone and gave a call, but Zhang Ye\u2019s cellphone was switched off.Jia Yan tried to instigate matters, \u201cHe\u2019s not picking up?\u201dBig Sis Zhou stared at him, \u201cHis phone is switched off; maybe he\u2019s still sleeping.\u201dWu Datao seethed, \u201cIsn\u2019t this not treating work seriously? He decides not to come on a whim? He has become arrogant just with this bit of results? Does he even have the Leader in his eyes?\u201dWith this fault to pick on, a few colleagues who had extremely poor relations with Zhang Ye began to fan the flames. Their tones made it even worse.Suddenly, Zhang Ye came in from outside. Hearing everyone say his name, he asked strangely, \u201cDirector, are you looking for me?\u201d He was still unsure of what had happened.Zhao Guozhou looked at him, \u201cWhy are you so late?\u201dZhang Ye was puzzled, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not late. I reached here at 7+ in the morning.\u201d He shook the bunch of keys in his hand, \u201cI got the keys from the door keeper\u2019s room, and was in the recording studio, recording my program. I wanted to record a few more episodes today, so I came in earlier, so as to not need to line up to wait for the recording studio.\u201dWhat?You came in at 7?He had been working and recording all this time?Tian Bin, Jia Yan and Wu Datao\u2019s faces turned ugly.Big Sis Zhou laughed and mocked at Tian Bin and company. She again stood up for Zhang Ye, \u201cI was wondering why Teacher Little Zhang\u2019s cellphone was switched off; so he was recording programs.\u201dZhao Guozhou glanced at Jia Yan and company from the corner of his eyes before finally patting Zhang Ye on the shoulder in a satisfied manner. He smiled, \u201cVery good. However, you must make sure to rest. Don\u2019t work too hard.\u201d\u201cThank you, Director; I will.\u201d Zhang Ye said.\u201cGo back to your seat. I\u2019ll announce the results.\u201d Zhao Guozhou said warmly.Noting that Director Zhao\u2019s attitude towards Zhang Ye was changing, Tian Bin\u2019s heart began to quiver. He suddenly felt a sense of danger. \u201cLate-night Ghost Stories\u201d had just been returned to his hands. \u201cGhost Blows Out the Light\u201d was not done broadcasting, and it would be some time before Tian Bin managed to really take up the job. However, with the way things were going, why did he feel a sense of danger? Could Zhang Ye steal the anchor position of \u201cLate-night Ghost Stories\u201d once again?Zhao Guozhou began announcing the listenership ratings.\u201cFirst place. \u2018Talk About the World\u2019, listenership 3.69%\u201cSecond place, \u2018Old and Young Story Club\u2019, listenership\u2026 2.98%!\u201d\u201cThird place, \u2018Late-night Ghost Stories\u2019, listenership rating\u2026 1.97%!\u201dWith the top three announced, everyone was already speechless and unsure about what to do. Some people even let out audible heavy breaths!This was too fierce!Was this something that no one could stop?Even \u201cLate-night Ghost Stories\u201d had gone up as well! It had gained third place!Ever since Zhang Ye had a new segment, the first episode of \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d had replaced \u201cEntertainment Daily\u201d\u2018s second placing. \u201cLate-night Ghost Stories\u201d, which was always third in place then got pushed back to become fourth. However, now, with Wu Datao and his partners frequently having errors in his program, \u201cEntertainment Daily\u201d\u2018s listenership ratings have begun to drop off. Even \u201cLate-night Ghost Stories\u201d had surpassed this news-related segment, and had even reached a shocking 1.97% listenership rating. Ignoring their Literature Channel, even in the Central Broadcasting Radio Station, or even in all the radio station channels in the country, there were no late-night segments with such a f***ing ridiculous listenership rating! This\u2026This was about to break 2%?F***!Was this still a late-night segment?Even prime-time segments were not so fierce!Only those colleagues who had been steadfastly listening to \u201cLate-night Ghost Stories\u201d were not surprised. This was because they knew that \u201cGhost Blows Out the Light\u201d had ended a particular arc a few days ago and had begun to lay a foundation for a new story. During these few days, it was in a thrilling climax and was especially interesting or even very scary. This naturally pulled up the listenership ratings, resulting in another small outbreak. So it was no wonder that it could exceed \u201cEntertainment Daily\u201d.Actually, what shocked everyone the most was the listenership ratings for \u201cOld and Young Story Club\u201d!The first episode was 2.49%The second episode was 2.45%The third episode was 2.51%There was supposed to be the fourth episode being broadcast the day before yesterday, but it was cancelled due to the Mid-Autumn Poetry Meet, so there was no listenership rating for that day. The real fourth episode had been shifted to yesterday, which was also the listenership rating that was announced today!2.98%!This growth was too defiant of the Heavens!This was almost like making rockets! It was flying up in such a short period of time!How can that be? Their channel had never had such a jump between listenership ratings before! They acknowledged that Zhang Ye\u2019s new story, \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d, was indeed very fascinating; however, even the best segment and story needed a gradual process of improvement. It could not have such a jump without any signs, right? Eh, that\u2019s not right! Who said that there were no signs? Many people realized after giving it some thought! It was the Mid-Autumn Poetry Meet! It was winning first place with \u201cShuidiao Getou\u201d that allowed Zhang Ye\u2019s fame to greatly increase! The live broadcast of the Mid-Autumn Poetry Meet happened to be the time slot for Zhang Ye\u2019s program. And from various factors like this were \u201cOld and Young Story Club\u201d and even \u201cLate-night Ghost Stories\u201d brought to such an amazing height!This was 2.98%!It was going to break three soon?In the history of the Literature Channel, only three programs had broken the 3% rating barrier. One of them was \u201cCriticizing Books\u201d, and another was \u201cDaily Jokes\u201d. These two segments had a historical reason for breaking 3%. Back then, television was still not universal, and radio broadcasting was the main avenue. Later on, with television and the internet becoming prevalent, \u201cCriticizing Books\u201d was axed six to seven years ago, due to poor ratings. \u201cDaily Jokes\u201d had now changed into a witty skit segment. It could be said to have ceased to exist. Today, the only program in history that still managed to break 3% in the Literature Channel was Wang Xiaomei\u2019s \u201cTalk About the World\u201d!But now, another one was about to appear!What sort of glory was this? It was about to enter the Beijing Radio Station\u2019s annals soon!And it was highly possible for \u201cLate-night Ghost Stories\u201d to break a record, too! No, actually it should be said that ever since \u201cLate-night Ghost Stories\u201d was in Zhang Ye\u2019s hands, it was making new records every day. It had created a history and miracle for late-night midnight segments! And this miracle was about to usher in a new peak!Breaking 2%!If \u201cGhost Blows Out the Light\u201d\u2018s rating could break 2%, this was not just creating history in the Beijing Radio Station, but history for the entire country\u2019s late-night segments on radio!A newcomer!Two segments!They had all reached a peak at this moment!Zhang Ye\u2019s results had made everyone envious; however, Zhang Ye was clearly not satisfied. It could even be said that he was far from satisfied!He wanted to get the Silver Microphone Award!He could not stop in his footsteps; he needed to climb even higher. He could still go further!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Let\u2019s go for lunch.\u201d\u201cI have to congratulate you in advance. You might break a record tomorrow!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! If it all goes well tomorrow, your programs will definitely break 2% and 3%. At the very latest, it should happen the day after tomorrow. Don\u2019t forget to give us a treat when that happens. I would not believe if your bonus money is less than 20,000 this month. Haha! Speaking of which, Little Zhang\u2019s two program segments are in the channel\u2019s top three, and also in the station\u2019s top 20. This is already a record in itself! Imagine our old comrades from the past; only a small handful of them could have done the same.\u201dEveryone was praising him.Except for Tian Bin, Jia Yan and a few others, everyone else in the Literature Channel was friendly towards Zhang Ye now. If Zhang Ye could really wield his prowess and break a few station, or even national, records by bringing up his listenership ratings, then everyone in the Literature Channel would also stand to gain. There was a rule in the station that not only gave out rewards for individual performances, but also for team performances. Their whole channel\u2019s employees could all gain an increase in wages of 10% to 20% due to Zhang Ye\u2019s performance. When Wang Xiaomei\u2019s segment broke 4% the previous time, everyone received a reward of about 1,000. It all depended on what record Zhang Ye could create now.Zhang Ye smiled wrily, \u201cDon\u2019t expect too much. This time was just a coincidence that the results shot up by so much. It may not continue on.\u201d\u201cShouldn\u2019t it be possible?\u201d Big Sis Zhou was a little unsure now.Zhang Ye waved it off, \u201cThere are no guarantees.\u201dAuntie Sun smiled, \u201cWe will just see tomorrow\u2019s results. Let\u2019s not give Teacher Little Zhang too much pressure.\u201dWang Xiaomei took her lunch box and prepared to go to the canteen. She obviously had wanted to bring her lunch back to the office to eat, but the canteen didn\u2019t have takeaway boxes. Wang Xiaomei gave a glance at Zhang Ye when she was passing him and suddenly stopped in her tracks, \u201cDid you put on makeup today? Or use skincare products? Eye cream?\u201dZhang Ye was stunned, \u201cNo?\u201dBig Sis Zhou wondered, \u201cHey, I also felt it when Teacher Xiaomei said that. It\u2019s not makeup, but why does Teacher Little Zhang feel a little different today?\u201dSomeone asked, \u201cReally?\u201dAnother asked, \u201cNothing changed, right?\u201dAuntie Sun said, \u201cHow could there be no changes? When I saw Little Zhang today, I felt it immediately. Shouldn\u2019t this be a case of when everything is going well, the spirit is also refreshed? Haha. Look, it\u2019s like he has become more handsome. His eyes are also discharging electricity every moment. Little Zhang doesn\u2019t have a girlfriend, right? Auntie can introduce one to you. Do you want me to?\u201dZhang Ye\u2019s assistant, Xiaofang, also laughed, \u201cTeacher Zhang did become more handsome.\u201dZhang Ye finally understood why the question of makeup was brought up. They were actually talking about the effects brought about by the Fruit of Charm. \u201cEven my eyes can discharge electricity? Damn, that\u2019s too exaggerated!\u201dXiaofang nodded furiously, \u201cFor real!\u201dShe said nice words and had good taste. Zhang Ye was feeling very proud right now.\u2026Afternoon.The letters from the listeners had arrived.Zhang Ye was once again the one who received the most letters within the channel. There were over 400 letters, more than Wang Xiaomei by a hundred. It wasn\u2019t hard to guess why. Zhang Ye had two programs, so the letters were also a combination of both of them. Besides, a children\u2019s program would definitely get more letters than an adult\u2019s program. Therefore, it cannot be said that just because of this, Zhang Ye could replace Wang Xiaomei as the channel\u2019s top host. He couldn\u2019t do it, because he was a guy.The letters were written by a mixture of both adults and children.\u201cPlease speed up the narration!\u201d\u201c\u2019The Wizard of Oz\u2019 is really interesting, but it\u2019s too slow!\u201d\u201cUncle Zhang, could you read it faster? I can\u2019t wait any longer!\u201d\u201cThe program duration is too short. Comrade Zhang, I hope the program duration can be extended, or that the speed could be increased. It\u2019s making me so eager to listen!\u201dA lot of listeners put in their suggestions.Zhang Ye thought about it. He also felt that the suggestions were valid. When he was narrating \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d, he had maintained the speed and softness of when he had read \u201cLittle Bunnies Be Good\u201d. After all, this was a children\u2019s program and he wanted to take care of them, so he narrated it very slowly. But the letters this time made him reconsider. The speed could definitely be quicker. Because \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d had a more mature theme and suited a larger age group, it would not be suitable to use style of \u201cLittle Bunnies Be Good\u201d. The children might still accept this, but the adults definitely would not have the patience. They might like the story itself, but if it was too slow with its emphasis on every word, the adults might not continue to tune in.Some changes were required!Three chapters per segment was possible. Adding one chapter wouldn\u2019t be too difficult!Zhang Ye had Xiaofang contact the recording studio for a booking. He stayed inside the studio for the whole afternoon to prepare the recordings for tomorrow and the day after. Zhang Ye had already recorded tomorrow\u2019s broadcast this morning, but for the quality of the program, Zhang Ye did not think twice about deleting the recording from before. He re-recorded a full three chapters for tomorrow and almost doubled the speed of narration for them. He had set very high standards for himself. He only finalized it after a few recordings.\u2026The next day.Friday.Everyone had arrived early. Zhang Ye was in the spotlight today. Everyone from the Literature Channel also thought so and were waiting for history to be rewritten, but were unsure if it could happen. Yesterday\u2019s result was a special case. That rating had been brought about by the attention from the Mid-Autumn Poetry Meet event.Zhao Guozhou also came in very early today. When they saw him coming in at 9:10 A.M., they all saw the smile he had on his face.He got it?He broke a historical record?They listened to Zhao Guozhou announcing, \u201cToday I will not be reading the listenership ratings in order of ranking. First, I would like to announce yesterday\u2019s 3rd placing, Zhang Ye, \u2018Late-night Ghost Stories\u2019. The listenership rating is\u2026..\u201d pausing on purpose to pique everyone\u2019s curiosity, Zhao Guozhou continued on, \u201cEveryone applaud! Ghost Stories\u2019 listenership rating is 2.01%! Maybe some people have already expected it. Yes, the program has broken the 2% rating barrier. Not only has it broken the listenership rating record for late-night programs of the same period, it has once again refreshed the historical record for the midnight segment in the country. It has replaced the Central Radio Station\u2019s \u2018The Sound of the City\u2019\u2019s legendary \u2018Zero Point Night Chat\u2019 from thirteen years ago, which had a 1.99% listenership rating! Now! This legend belongs to us! It belongs to our Beijing Radio Station!\u201dWhew!Thunderous applause!\u201cHaha!\u201d\u201cToo awesome!\u201d\u201cToo impressive!\u201d\u201cI think our channel is about to defy the Heavens!\u201dIt has even exceeded the late-night segment, \u201cThe Sound of the City\u201d\u2018s rating. It may not seem like much, exceeding it by only 0.02%. What was 0.02%, right? However, it was not that simple. Maybe only people in the industry would be shocked by this news. Why would it be shocking? Because it was too shocking!This was a listenership rating from thirteen years ago. What sort of position did the radio station have back then? It had half dominance, and was already in decline, but it had not been completely taken out by television. A large number of people still maintained the habit of listening to the radio. It was completely different from the harsh broadcasting environment of today. The audience size differed by tens of times! But even so, \u201cLate-night Ghost Stories\u201d had managed to replace \u201cZero Point Night Chat\u201d\u2018s record! What sort of value was this!? To people in the industry, this was something impossible!However, Zhang Ye had managed to do it!\u201cGhost Blows Out the Light\u201d had managed to do it!\u201cLate-night Ghost Stories\u201d had managed to do it!People had reason to believe, that although they were unable to tell for sure at this moment, that the people on \u201cThe Sound of the City\u201d had definitely received this news. They were definitely in a state of shock. They might have never expected that someone could break a listenership record from more than ten years ago in such a broadcasting environment!Big Sis Zhou wailed, \u201cTeacher Little Zhang, say a few words.\u201dZhao Guozhou also smiled, \u201cLittle Zhang, tell everyone your mood?\u201d\u201cVery excited.\u201d Zhang Ye stood up and spoke, \u201cI\u2019m really very excited. I had never expected to have such a result, either. Actually, back when I created \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019, everyone should know that it was due to extenuating circumstances. I had braved myself to narrate that one episode, so as to not have a live broadcast incident. To have reached the point of today\u2019s result, I need to thank everyone for your help. Thank you for the Leader\u2019s trust. This is not my achievement alone, but is also the hard efforts of our team.\u201dZhao Guozhou gave a deep nod, \u201cWell said.\u201dEveryone gave another round of applause and gave their congratulations.Zhao Guozhou opened up the form in his hand, \u201cLet me carry on announcing. First place is still Teacher Xiaomei\u2019s \u2018Talk About the World\u2019. Listenership 3.77%.\u201d With a pause, he said with a smile, \u201cI know everyone is very concerned with the next listenership rating. Yes, it\u2019s still Little Zhang\u2019s segment. Second place, \u2018Old and Young Story Club\u2019. Listenership\u20263.17%!\u201dAh? 3.17%!Compared to yesterday\u2019s 2.98%, it had jumped even more?It can\u2019t be! Why is it jumping higher every day!?Even if the Mid-Autumn Poetry Meet had attracted many new listeners, it shouldn\u2019t have jumped like that, right? Could it be the charm of a serialized story? A serialization had managed to consolidate the listeners further? This was definitely the case! People were still awed. Back then, people had questioned Zhang Ye\u2019s use of a fairy tale serialization. Even Teacher Feng and several experienced old comrades had rebuffed his method of telling such a story. However, Zhang Ye had ignored their reproach and carried on going forward. He had used facts to tell everyone that others might not be able to do it with a serialization, but in his hands, it was possible!Zhao Guozhou was extremely pleased as he looked warmly at Zhang Ye, \u201c\u2018Old and Young Story Club\u2019 has broken 3%, and it has broken way above 3%. We still need to give Teacher Little Zhang another round of applause. Our Literature Channel will have four segments that have broken 3% from now on. Our Beijing Radio Station only has 25 segments that have broken 3% in listenership ratings, too. So everyone remember this name, \u2018Old and Young Story Club\u2019!\u201dWhat was originally in last place had now become a star program that had broken through 3% in its listenership rating in just a week! This miracle could not be said to be not great! The Literature Channel\u2019s colleagues had witnessed the entire process. Even now, a lot of them could hardly believe it. This was not a miracle anymore!It was a divine act of God!As changeable as the clouds and rain, a divine act of God had made it come back from the dead!Everyone even had the thought that according to the rate at which the listenership ratings were increasing, could \u201cOld and Young Story Club\u201d have a chance at catching up to \u201cTalk About the World\u201d?People were shocked by their own thoughts!It can\u2019t be, right? No matter how ridiculous it was, it can\u2019t chase up to Wang Xiaomei\u2019s segment, right?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As he had rested from Wednesday all the way to today, he definitely needed to work overtime. However, his colleagues had worked overtime last week, so they were on break now.The telephone in the office rang.Zhang Ye noticed that a few editors and clerks were busy, so he picked up the phone, \u201cHello. How are you? This is the Literature Channel.\u201d\u201cLittle Zhang, right? I\u2019m Zhao Guozhou.\u201d The phone call was from Director Zhao, \u201cI was just looking for you. Come over to my office.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Zhang Ye went over the moment he put down the phone. He knocked on the Director\u2019s office door. Zhao Guozhou was reading the listenership ratings table inside, \u201cAre you looking for me?\u201d\u201cHere, take a seat.\u201d Zhao Guozhou lowered his hand. \u201cTake a look for yourself.\u201dZhang Ye sat down and looked at the form that was passed into his hand. It was the ratings rankings for Friday. \u201cLate-night Ghost Stories\u201d had dropped back down to 1.9+%. Clearly, it had lost momentum. It would be difficult for it to go higher. After all, it was a late-night segment that had a limited audience. This was nothing to be surprised about, but the listenership rating for \u201cOld and Young Story Club\u201d made Zhang Ye pleasantly surprised. It had increased once again!Its listenership rating was 3.31%.And at first place, \u201cTalk About the World\u201d only had a 3.63% listenership rating.One had dropped, while the other had risen. The gap between the two segments had once again narrowed!This was something that had never happened before. No one had managed to force the number one girl, Wang Xiaomei\u2019s, segment to such a dire point!To see Zhao Guozhou say, \u201cMaybe it was because many students were having a school holiday on Friday afternoon, but your segment\u2019s numbers have once again sharply increased. Even the station\u2019s management has been startled. Beautifully done, Little Zhang. I knew I didn\u2019t make a mistake with you.\u201d Following that, he said, \u201cI saw the segment chart for today, just now. The program after yours at 1 P.M. is \u2018Weekend Laughing Forest\u2019. This program should be no stranger to you. Typically, it doesn\u2019t have an anchorman; it just broadcasts some skits or cross talk that we bought the copyrights to. However, as skits and cross talks are slowly deteriorating, as there are too few good works, we have been broadcasting the same skits over the past few weeks for \u2018Weekend Laughing Forest\u2019. It has lost a lot of its audience, and has also been greatly criticized. Hence, for this weekend, I\u2019m thinking of temporarily halting \u2018Weekend Laughing Forest\u2019, and handing you the time period from 1 P.M. to 2 P.M.\u201dZhang Ye said, \u201cIs that alright?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s only for this weekend. Can your story keep up?\u201d Zhao Guozhou asked.\u201cThere\u2019s no problem on my side. If I\u2019m given a total of four hours for today and tomorrow for my broadcast, I can definitely finish \u2018The Wizard of Oz\u2019 this weekend.\u201d Zhang Ye said.Zhao Guozhou tapped the table as he thought, \u201cAlright. Then, let\u2019s do it. This opportunity is yours, so it\u2019s up to you to grab the opportunity well.\u201dZhang Ye promised, \u201cThank you, Leader. I will do my best!\u201dZhao Guozhou said, \u201cGo to the recording studio and get it done as soon as possible.\u201d\u2026Walking into Recording Studio #4, Zhang Ye felt his body full of energy again. It felt like he had inexhaustible strength, so he quickly got down to recording the segment for the weekend. This was a great opportunity. He had also seen a glimmer of hope of surpassing Wang Xiaomei for the first time. Although he knew that it was still very difficult, and was almost unrealistic, Zhang Ye still wanted to fight for it. He wanted to do it for his records of service, for a chance at grabbing one of the Silver Microphone Awards and for him to be able to enter the television station!The recording began.\u201cHello, everyone. Today\u2019s program will have some temporary adjustments. \u2018Old and Young Story Club\u2019 will be broadcast from 12 noon to 2 P.M., so please do not change the channel. After it ends at 1 P.M., there will be a short advertisement before \u2018The Wizard of Oz\u2019 carries on its broadcast. And this weekend, \u2018The Wizard of Oz\u2019 will also come to its end. I hope that everyone will listen to it punctually.\u201d After adding these words, Zhang Ye began recording.Working until the afternoon, he finally managed to finish recording \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d.After he came out, he wanted to look for Zhao Guozhou, so that he could ask about the listenership ratings; however, he could not find him. The Leader had gotten off work, so he could not do anything but wait until Monday.\u2026He had a day off on Sunday.The listenership ratings were not out and the announcement was delayed.\u2026Monday.Today seemed to be the day that was destined to be enshrined in the Literature Channel\u2019s historical annals.After Zhang Ye got off the subway, he met Wang Xiaomei, who had been recognized by two male fans, in front of the station platform. Teacher Xiaomei was giving the fans her signature.\u201cThank you, Teacher Xiaomei.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. Is that all?\u201d\u201cCan we get a picture together? I really like your \u2018Talk About the World\u2019!\u201d\u201cNext time. I came to work late today, so I\u2019m running late.\u201dSeeing Wang Xiaomei cross the road, Zhang Ye also walked up to her, \u201cTeacher Wang.\u201dWang Xiaomei turned at look at him and acknowledged tersely, \u201cI heard your program\u2019s listenership rating on Friday had increased once again? 3.31%, right? It\u2019s very good.\u201dZhang Ye said, \u201cThere are more children resting on Friday, so it went up.\u201dWang Xiaomei said, \u201cAren\u2019t there even more resting on Saturday? Also, parents do not need to work.\u201d\u201cUh, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s of course good if it can increase a bit more.\u201d Zhang Ye said nonchalantly.However, Wang Xiaomei said, \u201cWork hard, then. It\u2019s not that easy to surpass my listenership ratings.\u201d Her tone sounded a bit prickly. She left after she finished speaking.Zhang Ye smiled bitterly.At the unit\u2019s office, today\u2019s atmosphere felt particularly weird.\u201cDid you hear? The rating for \u2018Old and Young Story Club\u2019 on Friday was 3.31%!\u201d\u201cI knew about it the day before yesterday. It\u2019s really such an exaggeration!\u201d\u201cSay, do you think Teacher Little Zhang will really reach the top of our channel?\u201d\u201cIt might have just been a fluke. I don\u2019t think it will happen. Teacher Xiaomei has been number one all these years. Her segment\u2019s foundation lies deep, so it shouldn\u2019t be taken down.\u201d\u201cBut Teacher Little Zhang is too fierce! He has already chased to just about 0.3% left. Besides, I\u2019ve heard they are giving him an additional hour over the weekend. They have halted \u2018Weekend Laughing Forest\u2019 for two episodes. There are also more people resting over the weekend, so an afternoon session might be able to rival a prime-time session at night!\u201d\u201cThat is still impossible.\u201d\u201cRight. Teacher Xiaomei isn\u2019t a pushover.\u201dEveryone was discussing about this matter. The moment that they saw Wang Xiaomei enter, they stopped talking. Following her in immediately to the unit was Zhang Ye, who received a lot of attention from everyone. For a full half an hour, the entire office was quiet. No one spoke a word. Everyone was not really into their work. Today was the Literature Channel\u2019s battle of the top boy and girl. Even if it did not have anything to do with them, they were still curious.Suddenly, everyone put down the things in their hands.\u201cDirector.\u201d\u201cLeader.\u201dZhao Guozhou had arrived, \u201cAlright.\u201dThis time, he did not need to speak any further, as everyone stopped working and uniformly looked towards him.Instead, it was Wang Xiaomei and Zhang Ye, who were the people directly involved and today\u2019s main characters, that did not have many changes in their expressions. They seemed nonchalant.Zhao Guozhou looked at the listenership ratings in his hand. His eyes looked very complicated, \u201cLet me first announce the ratings for the programs on Saturday. There are quite a lot of things today, so I will not announce all of them. I\u2019ll first announce the top three.\u201d Looking up to look at everyone, \u201cFirst place, \u2018Talk About the World\u2019, listenership 3.81%!\u201d3.81%?Teacher Xiaomei was indeed not someone simple!Actually, the listenership ratings for \u201cTalk About the World\u201d had been dropping over the past few days, so that even Zhang Ye had managed to chase up to it by quite a bit. People were even worried for Wang Xiaomei. But today\u2019s results made everyone understand that Zhang Ye had no chance. Teacher Xiaomei had gotten serious!\u201cSecond place, \u2018Old and Young Story Club\u2019, listenership\u2026 3.55%!\u201dHoly ****! Many people gasped again! It added another 0.2%?Teacher Xiaomei had an explosive increase, but Teacher Little Zhang was not far off, either? However, it was still off by a bit; \u201cOld and Young Story Club\u201d would definitely not be able to catch up!Sure enough, Zhao Guozhou said, \u201cNext I\u2019ll announce the listenership ratings for Sunday.\u201d When he said this, Zhao Guozhou specially looked at Wang Xiaomei and Zhang Ye, \u201cTeacher Xiaomei\u2019s \u2018Talk About the World\u2019, the listenership rating is still at 3.81%!\u201dBig Sis Zhou sighed as she murmured, \u201cLittle Zhang, there will still be plenty of opportunities in the future.\u201dAunt Sun also comforted Zhang Ye, \u201cDon\u2019t lose heart. Second place is already very formidable. Don\u2019t compare your segment with \u2018Talk About the World\u2019. It\u2019s nothing disgraceful to lose to it.\u201dZhang Ye smiled, \u201cIt\u2019s alright.\u201d He had not given up, because he had noticed that Zhao Guozhou may have first mentioned Wang Xiaomei\u2019s listenership rating, but he had not said that she was first. On Sunday, \u2018The Wizard of Oz\u2019 had came to an end, and that was also the climax of the entire story. It was also a two-hour segment, so Zhang Ye believed that even if he did not get first place, his listenership rating would definitely be much higher than Saturday\u2019s.It was not over!He still had a chance!Zhang Ye was not confident in himself, but confident in his own story. This was \u2018The Wizard of Oz\u2019, one of the greatest fairy tales in his world!Tian Bin funnily looked at Zhang Ye. He was thinking, \u201cTo think you still hoped to get first place? To really surpass \u2018Talk About the World\u2019? You sure are funny!\u201dFrom the eyes of Jia Yan and Wu Datao beside him, one could tell that they were thinking Zhang Ye was having fantasies!Alright!The situation was fixed!Time to do whatever you had to busy yourself with!With this outcome, people no longer had any intention of listening.However, what Zhao Guozhou said next stunned everyone. Zhao Guozhou looked at them and said, \u201cBut Sunday\u2019s first place is not \u2018Talk About the World\u2019.\u201d After everyone stared widely with their mouths agape, Zhao Guozhou said, \u201cFirst place, Zhang Ye\u2019s \u2018Old and Young Story Club\u2019, listenership\u2026 3.82%!\u201dWhat?Higher than \u201cTalk About the World\u201d by 0.01%?With a \u201cHula\u201d sound, the entire office seemed like a bomb had dropped! It exploded instantaneously!Tian Bin was dumbfounded! Jia Yan\u2019s eyeballs stared like a cow! Big Sis Zhou was so shocked that her throat vibrated for a long while! The looks of the other colleagues were each more astonished than the last!Zhang Ye had reached the top!Zhang Ye had actually reached the top!Although the gap was tiny, first place was still first place!No one understood how Zhang Ye had managed to do it! No one could understand why \u2018The Wizard of Oz\u2019 was full of magic! But the facts were placed in front of them! This newcomer, Zhang Ye, had managed to use a segment that was ranked right at the bottom to pull Wang Xiaomei\u2019s star segment down from its divine spot!It went from first from the back to first from the front!Zhang Ye had used less than two weeks to achieve it!What the heck! What sort of perverse existence did this Zhang Ye come from!Chapter 69: Little Zhang Reached the Top of the Literature Channel!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Based on his strengths, everyone knew that Zhang Ye would achieve this someday, but no one had expected it to be so soon!Zhao Guozhou continued, \u201cAdditionally, yesterday\u2019s \u2018Old and Young Story Club\u2019 placed fourth in the entire station\u2019s listenership ratings!\u201dIt had gone to the top 4?Only second to several of the news and traffic segments?Zhao Guozhou looked towards Wang Xiaomei and said encouragingly, \u201cTeacher Xiaomei, Teacher Little Zhang is catching up. Your program finally has a competitor now and won\u2019t be lonely anymore. If you don\u2019t push harder, Little Zhang\u2019s segment might really end up in first place.\u201dWang Xiaomei calmly replied, \u201cI will.\u201dZhang Ye followed up modestly, \u201cIt won\u2019t; it\u2019s just my good luck that there were more weekend listeners and the program duration was extended by an hour with \u2018The Wizard of Oz\u2019 ending at its climax. All these helped to pull up the ratings. It won\u2019t be able to continue to compete for first tomorrow and will definitely be lower again.\u201dEveryone knew so too, but why did it matter? Getting first one time was still getting first. In the past few years, no one in the Literature Channel had dared to challenge Wang Xiaomei\u2019s \u201cTalk About the World\u201d. Zhang Ye was the first.. and he even succeeded!\u201cI want to add on something.\u201d Zhao Guozhou finally smiled and said loudly, \u201cYesterday, on Sunday, our Literature Channel\u2019s overall listenership rating managed to exceed the Traffic Channel\u2019s total listenership rating for the first time in 11 years. We are ranked second overall in the station! This was a team effort that contributed to our channel\u2019s brilliance. I would like to take the chance here to specially praise Teacher Zhang Ye for helping to pull up the two segments which had the channel\u2019s lowest listenership and bringing them to first and third place. Just his contributions alone have brought us amazing listenership ratings; it\u2019s also the main reason for us surpassing the Traffic Channel for the first time in 11 years! I feel that everyone here, no matter if you are a rookie or veteran, could learn from Little Zhang!\u201dThey had not obtained second place in 11 years!In the past, it had always been in fourth place, suppressed by the Music Channel. Later on, it was always in third place, behind the Traffic Channel. But today, their wish had finally been granted?\u201cAmazing!\u201d\u201cHaha! It\u2019s time to disburse the rewards, Leader!\u201d\u201cNo one can stop us from now on!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s work even harder and surpass the News Channel, too!\u201dSome roared. Some bragged. In any case, everyone was on an emotional high.Zhao Guozhou gestured for everyone to be quiet and said, \u201cThis afternoon, I will call the shots. Everyone do what you need to and we will break for lunch at 10:30 A.M. Let\u2019s go to a restaurant outside for a good meal. It\u2019ll be my treat!\u201d\u201cOh!\u201d\u201cLong live our Leader!\u201d\u201cCan we order expensive items?\u201dZhao Guozhou gave a smile, \u201cChoose whatever you like! Anything is fine!\u201dZhang Ye said, \u201cI guess I won\u2019t be joining? I still have a recording later. \u2018The Wizard of Oz\u2019 has ended and I have to tell a new story today.\u201dBig Sis Zhou happily said, \u201cHow could you not go?\u201d\u201cRight. Little Zhang must go. You are the star.\u201d Auntie Sun urged.Zhao Guozhou also added, \u201cEveryone must go; no one can give it a miss. As long as we get back before noon, your broadcast will not be late. Let\u2019s not discuss this any further. Don\u2019t think that I have forgotten your specialty. You don\u2019t need any preparation at all. Since when have you made a mistake during a live broadcast?\u201dZhang Ye rubbed his temple, \u201cAlright. Then, I will follow the Leader\u2019s instructions.\u201d\u201cThat settles it, then. We\u2019ll set off at 10:30 A.M. I will gather everyone in a while.\u201d Zhao Guozhou then left.Zhang Ye had something to discuss. After thinking for a moment, he followed him out. Seeing Zhao Guozhou going into his office, he followed in closely behind, \u201cDirector.\u201dZhao Guozhou turned back to look, \u201cAh, Little Zhang. Hur Hur. How can I help you?\u201dZhang Ye coughed a bit and said nervously, \u201cAbout that\u2026 I saw on the news a few days ago that the nominations for the Golden and Silver Microphone Awards will be held soon. I\u2019ve joined the station for almost two months now and I won\u2019t talk about my performance, but it\u2019s been quite okay. I haven\u2019t been working for a year yet, so I fit the criteria for the Silver Microphone Awards. Do you think that I could get a nomination?\u201d As no one had discussed this with him before, Zhang Ye could only bring it up himself.Zhao Guozhou acknowledged this and signaled for him to take a seat, \u201cIt\u2019s just this matter? I was still expecting something else. You are asking about this today? If I had waited for you to apply for the nomination, it would have been too late already.\u201d While speaking, he pulled out a drawer from his desk and took out a document, \u201cHere. This is a copy. The original has been submitted to the Station Leader a few days back. I recommended that you be nominated for the Silver Microphone Awards and sent this over, together with your resume.\u201dZhang Ye wore an expression of joy, \u201cYou recommended me already? Thank you, Leader. Thank you!\u201dZhao Guozhou told him, \u201cThe Silver Microphone Awards are not as important as the Golden Microphone Awards, so the nomination list for it is smaller, too. Our Beijing Radio Station has two nomination spots. Even though your nomination has not been approved by the management, I guess your nomination is almost guaranteed. Among all of this year\u2019s rookies, your results have been the most outstanding. There is no one close to your work performance; at the very most, there is someone from the News Channel called Zh\u0101ng Y\u011b*, who is performing reasonably well. If all goes according to expectations, then it\u2019s likely that you and Zh\u0101ng Y\u011b will be our station\u2019s two nominees. There\u2019s only one winner in the end and I expect it to be you. It is true that, in the past, the Golden and Silver Microphone Awards judges have always favored those from the news channels, but you are different. Your contributions are too outstanding. You have provided a dominating result that no one can compare with.\u201dZhang Ye asked, \u201cWhen is the selection date?\u201dZhao Guozhou answered, \u201cThis Friday, but only the Golden Microphone Awards will be broadcast live, not the Silver Microphone Awards.\u201dThe Silver Microphone Awards \u2014 10 winners from all the nation\u2019s radio stations.There were about 30 to 40 nominees, but only 10 received an award.The number of radio stations in the country amounted to more than that, but it was impossible to give every station an award. Only some of the key provinces and cities could be given the award. For example, Central Radio Station almost always had two winners, followed by Beijing Radio Station and Shanghai Radio Station, each of which usually had one winner. As for the other provinces, the other winners would rotate around their radio stations. Beijing Radio Station would never miss out on a spot, though, since its place was already politically guaranteed.That was why with the station\u2019s two nominations, there was a 50% chance for either person to win an award. No, according to Zhao Guozhou\u2019s analysis, Zhang Ye\u2019s chances at winning an award was 99%. As such, Zhang Ye felt refreshed and good about it. This time, with backing from his recent first place in the Literature Channel and the unprecedented history he had set, giving him a thicker resume, his confidence was emboldened. On the subject of the Silver Microphone Awards, Zhang Ye could only feel that it was a sure thing that was in the bag!Get down off your high horse quickly!He already couldn\u2019t wait to further his career at the TV station!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Because he was due for a live broadcast soon, he did not drink any alcohol, but instead only ate the food.Ring, ring, ring. Zhao Guozhou received a phone call. Shortly after he answered, he suddenly did not look too good. He hung up and then took a look at everyone, saying, \u201cI will head back first; there\u2019s a short meeting. You guys head back early after you are done. I\u2019ve settled the bill already; enjoy yourselves.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d\u201cWhy are you leaving now?\u201d\u201cThen we should head back, too.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right; we are almost done anyway.\u201dEveryone left, one after the other. They decided that they might as well return to the unit together.Zhang Ye was also wondering about Director Zhao\u2019s expression. But he couldn\u2019t care about it for now. After he went back, he sat in front of his computer to think about the story for his broadcast. Which should he choose? \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d had finished, and it had been received quite well, too. Should he choose another serialized fairy tale, again?His colleagues were also treating it as if it were any other day and were chatting during the lunch break.But at this time, an alarming piece of news had reached them!It was from an old editor from the Literature Channel, \u201cTeacher Zhang Ye, your \u2018Old and Young Story Club\u2019 has been replaced. The notice has just been passed down by the station. Jia Yan\u2019s \u2018Soaring Youth\u2019 will be taking over. You don\u2019t need to do your broadcasting today\u2026 Little Jia\u2019s pre-recorded program will be broadcasted instead!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Big Sis Zhou got anxious.Auntie Sun asked, \u201cWhy? Why so?\u201dWang Xiaomei was also stunned, \u201cWith the listenership ratings of \u2018Old and Young Story Club\u2019, why would it be taken off the air?\u201dThe old editor explained, \u201cThe management said that \u2018Soaring Youth\u2019 was a planned program and would certainly be implemented. Because \u2018Old and Young Story Club\u2019\u2019s listenership ratings soared during the weekend, the station plans to move Little Zhang\u2019s program to a weekend broadcast. It will be shortened from 7 days to 2 days, but the program duration will be increased. If that plan is executed, then \u2018Weekend Laughing Forest\u2019 will be axed, but all this is still being worked out and is not fixed, so Little Zhang temporarily does not have a segment for now. At least on the notice, \u2018Old and Young Story Club\u2019 has been taken off-air.\u201dZhang Ye\u2019s face sunk!Wang Xiaomei was acutely aware, saying, \u201cHe has no program now? Then what about Teacher Little Zhang\u2019s Silver Microphone Awards nomination? The rules for the nomination states that if a host has no program duties, they are not eligible to be nominated. Today is the deadline for the nominations, right?\u201dThe old editor paused for a moment, \u201cThat\u2019s why he wasn\u2019t nominated for the Silver Microphone Awards.\u201dOnce that was said, everyone became silent. The atmosphere was heavy inside the office!The station was too harsh! They were ruthless! Are they not trying to play Zhang Ye to death!?\u201cOld and Young Story Club\u201d would definitely not be canceled. No one would dare to cancel such an outstanding program. Not only would the station not agree to it, even the audience would not agree to it. That was why the station had only put the program on temporary hiatus and pushed the segment of Deputy Station Head Jia\u2019s relative, Jia Yan, up, and then told everyone that Story Club would be shifted to a weekend broadcast.However, they did not pass down a document to drag things out. With the procedures coming to a halt, it was only empty talk. Zhang Ye, who had been removed as the \u201cLate-night Ghost Stories\u201d anchor now no longer had any anchor duties.. at least before Friday! Why was it done this way? The answer was already very clear! Someone in the higher-ups obviously wanted to fix Zhang Ye! They just didn\u2019t want him to be up for the Silver Microphone Awards! In fact, they didn\u2019t even want him to be nominated! They even went to the extent of putting a cap onto Zhang Ye\u2019s program duration and influence! They had changed Jia Yan\u2019s program so that it could take over their Literature Channel\u2019s number one listening segment without directly informing the audience. By forcefully switching, a large number of Zhang Ye\u2019s listeners would end up supporting Jia Yan. This gave Jia Yan a flying start in his ratings!They had repressed Zhang Ye and let Jia Yan take advantage of the situation, killing two birds with one stone!This move made Zhang Ye\u2019s colleagues heart palpitate!This was really pushing Zhang Ye to his death! They even resorted to such venomous trickery? Did they need to push it so far with a rookie? To treat someone who had contributed so much to the station and brought pride to them, did they have to go so far? This had really made everyone\u2019s heart go cold!At this moment, even Tian Bin felt uncomfortable. Given that he had several conflicts with Zhang Ye, he wanted to see Zhang Ye embarrass himself. But no matter how much he disliked Zhang Ye, he also acknowledged Zhang Ye\u2019s abilities. His opponent had used his abilities to move up step by step, so even if Tian Bin could not accept it, he had to accept it. He was indeed inferior to his opponent. But what about you, Jia Yan? Just because you have a Station Leader as a relative, just because of that, you can come in and take up our resources? Get favored over every one of us? Even push a colleague off a cliff like that? This has really gone too far! Isn\u2019t the Station Leader going too far? Tian Bin may be quite close to Jia Yan, but that didn\u2019t mean he liked him!This time, Tian Bin did not kick Zhang Ye while he was down.Wu Datao glanced at Zhang Ye, but on this rare occasion, he did not gloat. He only shook his head helplessly and mourned silently for Zhang Ye\u2019s future and the current system. This was such a place that if the leaders wanted to fix you, there was no way of escaping it. You just sat idly and were fixed!There was always a benevolent side to the human mind. The station\u2019s treatment towards Zhang Ye was too much. It was also unreasonable and unfair. This had affected many of the staff in the unit and had left them inclined towards Zhang Ye\u2019s plight!Big Sis Zhou was nearly tearing, \u201cThey are such bullies! Bullies! Who has Little Zhang offended? How could they do this! The Silver Microphone Awards event only happens annually; if he misses this opportunity, it is over!\u201dAuntie Sun also did not hold back and said, \u201cDeputy Station Head Jia, does he think that he can behave so lawlessly?\u201dAt the side, a youth quickly said, \u201cAuntie, lower your voice; don\u2019t let people hear that.\u201dAuntie Sun was outraged, \u201cLittle Jia is not around; I\u2019m only saying a few more words. I really don\u2019t get it. What is the Station Head doing? Why is he not managing this? How can he just stay still, while watching some of these Leaders do the wrong things?\u201dThe old editor that had led the conversation hesitated for a moment, before saying softly, \u201cThere are no outsiders here today, and we have been old colleagues for decades. There might be some conflicts amongst our people, but we have stayed together over all sorts of hardships. Even through the friction, we are war comrades in the trenches, so let\u2019s just keep this amongst us and not spread this outside.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d\u201cWe won\u2019t.\u201d\u201cOld Zhou, you think too little of us.\u201dEveryone could see that he had something to say. They looked over at him in a serious manner.Having made sure that everyone was on common ground, the old editor explained, \u201cActually, Director Zhao tried very hard earlier in the meeting when he was notified of this matter. Director Zhao was in a rage and strongly disagreed about letting \u2018Soaring Youth\u2019 take over, but since it was already decided by the higher-ups, Director Zhao was also helpless.\u201d Looking at Auntie Sun, he said, \u201cJust now, Sis Sun asked why the Station Head is not doing anything about it. I shouldn\u2019t say too much, but I\u2019ve heard of some talk. I know of this from a friend from the News Channel. The other person that was nominated for the Silver Microphone Awards, Zh\u0101ng Y\u011b\u2026 His father is an old comrade-in-arms of our Station Head.\u201dNo wonder!No wonder Deputy Station Head Jia had nothing to fear!That was killing two birds with one stone? No! This was killing three birds with one stone! Fixing Zhang Ye, assisting Jia Yan, and promoting Zh\u0101ng Y\u011b!If Zhang Ye had been nominated, be it his literary standard or his broadcasting standard or his accomplishments, Zhang Ye would no doubt have gotten the only spot for the Silver Microphone Awards given to the Beijing Radio Station. There was no way that Zh\u0101ng Y\u011b would have a chance at it. But now that the person in charge of the Literature Channel, Deputy Station Head Jia, had used an extremely ruthless method to trample down upon Zhang Ye, leaving Zh\u0101ng Y\u011b as the only nominee, then was there any need to decide on who would win the Silver Microphone Award? It would definitely go to him! With this, Deputy Station Head Jia would not need to be worried about other Station Leaders accusing him of abusing his powers. From a certain viewpoint, he could be considered as following the instructions of the Station Head. Who would dare question him then?At this moment, Jia Yan came back.The old editor and the others saw him and they did not mention the issue again, afraid that the Leader would hear of this.At the celebratory lunch, Jia Yan was still feeling a little down. But after he came back and disappeared for half an hour, he came back in high spirits. \u201cEditor Chen, my two broadcast recordings are still around, right?\u201dA female editor replied, \u201cThey\u2019re in the small room.\u201d\u201cGood. Help me to prepare them; in the future, from Monday to Friday, the afternoon segment will be changed to be mine.\u201d Jia Yan commanded, \u201cHurry up; it\u2019s almost 12 P.M.!\u201dThe female editor was unwilling, but could only go.Zhang Ye\u2019s heart felt cold. He also felt disgusted. When he had wanted to job-hop, he initially felt sorry, as the unit and organization had groomed him well. But now, Zhang Ye\u2019s decision was firm. With such a Leader in the station, he did not want to stay here for one second longer!Haven\u2019t you guys have gone too far?First, it was the Jia\u2019s, one old and one young!Now, even the Station Head wanted to trample on him a few times?Zhang Ye did not know what wrong he had done. You all had offered that little amount of money and tried to buy my copyright to \u201cGhost Blows Out the Light\u201d for your own profits. When I refused, you removed me from my program. That\u2019s fine, so I abandoned \u201cLate-night Ghost Stories\u201d. Then, I worked hard on my new program. Now that the program has reached the summit and set a trail of outstanding results for the station, you all f***ing coming at me again? And you even want to compress and repress my segment? You\u2019re even resorting to such underhand means to not let me get the Silver Microphone Awards nomination! Just to let Deputy Station Head Jia\u2019s relative step over me to gain his place? Just because of helping the Station Head\u2019s old war comrade\u2019s son win the Silver Microphone Award?I\u2019ve worked so hard to fight for such a result for the station and even helped a program from Beijing Radio Station break a record previously set by the Central Radio Station! And in the end? In the end, this is what I get?F*** your grandpa!Do you take me, Zhang Ye, to be a pushover?Beside him, a youth about the age of Zhang Ye advised in whispers, \u201cForget it, Teacher Zhang. You can\u2019t beat them. Just endure it. The station has purposely dragged to Friday before announcing the resumption of your segment, so as to stop your Silver Microphone Award nomination. Without an anchor position, you cannot be given the nomination, no matter who recommends you.\u201d He added on casually, \u201cThat is, unless one of the five judges for the Silver Microphone Awards give one of their additional nomination spots to you directly. Every year, there are three other additional nominations for the Golden Microphone Awards, while there are two for the Silver Microphone Awards. Only these spots do not need to gain the nomination through the stations, and can be put on the list of nominees through an exception.\u201dAdditional?There were additional spots?Zhang Ye\u2019s mind began churning. He recalled that Zhang Yuanqi was one of the judges this time!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He had lost his former positions as anchor for those two programs; he hasn\u2019t got a chance for this year\u2019s Silver Microphone Awards nomination!\u201d\u201cImpossible!\u201d\u201cRight\u2026 How can that be!\u201d\u201cWith his results, he can\u2019t get the Silver Microphone Award?\u201d\u201cWhat do you know? Do you know who is the new program\u2019s host that is taking over Zhang Ye\u2019s Monday to Friday segment? His name is Jia Yan; he\u2019s Deputy Station Head Jia\u2019s relative. Also, don\u2019t tell this to anyone or tell others that I told you this, but the nominee for the Silver Microphone Awards, Zh\u0101ng Y\u011b\u2026 His father and our Station Head are old comrades.\u201d\u201cThis\u2026\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t Zhang Ye too tragic?\u201d\u201cHai, he sure is unlucky enough!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s so disgusting for the Station to do this; not only did they not reward the station\u2019s greatest contributor, but they actually\u2026 What the heck is this!\u201d\u201cWell, he is the Leader, after all.\u201d\u201cIf the station carries on doing things like this, it will lose the trust of the people sooner or later!\u201d\u201cThe relatives and good friends of the Leader have to be well taken care of. That is normal human behavior; but, you shouldn\u2019t be so insidious. Isn\u2019t this forcing Zhang Ye to his death!?\u201dEveryone did not dare to openly question this, as this was a decision made by the Station Leader; however there was a flurry of discussion in the shadows. Everyone had a strong opinion about this.\u2026Deputy Station Head\u2019s office.There were two people in the room. One of them was Deputy Station Head Jia and the other was Zh\u0101ng Y\u011b.Deputy Station Head Jia was friendly, \u201cLittle Y\u011b, how has your work been recently?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s pretty good.\u201d Zh\u0101ng Y\u011b sat across him and said, \u201cI troubled Station Head Jia. Thank you for your concern.\u201dDeputy Station Head Jia smiled, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to be so polite. We aren\u2019t outsiders. I even saw you often in the Station Head\u2019s house when you were young. Do you still remember?\u201dZh\u0101ng Y\u011b touched his neck and said, \u201cI remember.\u201dDeputy Station Head Jia nodded, \u201cThen, let\u2019s talk about proper matters. Today is the deadline for the Silver Microphone Awards nominations. They will be officially selected on Friday. The station has only just submitted your name to the selection committee. As we do not have enough outstanding personnel in the Beijing Radio Station, we will only be nominating you. It is equivalent to handing one of the ten Silver Microphone Awards, which has been reserved for our Beijing Radio Station, to you. Calling you over is just a formality, so prepare your acceptance speech. You might even need to say a few words onstage. To put it nicely, it will be helpful for your future development. After all, there will quite a lot of famous people in the industry there on the day of the awards ceremony. There will be broadcasting Leaders, various producers from radio and television stations and famous anchors. Hur Hur, there will even be Heavenly Queen Zhang Yuanqi. So prepare your acceptance speech well and leave a deep impression on everyone.\u201dZh\u0101ng Y\u011b might have known of this earlier, so he was not very excited, \u201cThank you for Station Head Jia\u2019s nurturing; I will work hard.\u201d\u201cSo modest. Good.\u201d Deputy Station Head Jia said with appreciation, \u201cAfter you receive the Silver Microphone Award, your future will be limitless. After you have some training, people from the television station will definitely come for you, even without my recommendation.\u201d\u2026Literature Channel\u2019s office.Jia Yan energetically set off for the live broadcast studio. Although his program had been recorded, he still needed to make an opening statement and introduce himself.Big Sis Zhou hatefully watched his back, \u201cHe is a scoundrel having greatness thrust upon him!\u201dAuntie Sun said with comforting words, \u201cLittle Zhang, there will be plenty of opportunities in the future; don\u2019t worry.\u201d\u201cRight. Teacher Little Zhang, you will definitely be able to do it. There are still other awards in the future\u201d his assistant, Xiaofang, said.However, even if they said so, everyone knew there would not be such a good opportunity in the future. Indeed, there were other awards in the future, but which one of them had more value than the Silver Microphone Award? This was the nation\u2019s most prestigious newcomer award in the broadcasting world. There was only one a year and nominations were only allowed for rookies who had worked for less than three years. It would be gone once it was missed out on.Those famous radio announcers currently in the radio station, and those famous hosts currently on television\u2026 Which of them did not receive a Silver Microphone Award back then? They had all received it. They could reach their present height all because of the qualifications the Silver Microphone Award brought them. Receiving it was equivalent to having a thick layer of gold plating. It was completely different from those people who did not have this newcomer award!Many people felt pity for Zhang Ye!Many colleagues felt aggrieved for Zhang Ye!However, Zhang Ye\u2019s expression looked abnormally calm.\u201cLittle Zhang, don\u2019t let your thoughts go astray.\u201d Big Sis Zhou was extremely worried, \u201cIf you want to curse, curse a bit. Everyone here is on your side; no one will spread it out.\u201dZhang Ye said, \u201cI\u2019m fine, Big Sis Zhou.\u201dWang Xiaomei glanced at him and stood up to walk towards him.\u201cTeacher Xiaomei, what are you doing?\u201d Xiaofang noticed something was wrong.Wang Xiaomei said calmly, \u201cI\u2019m going to ask the station\u2019s Leader to change his mind; it\u2019s too demoralizing!\u201dBig Sis Zhou cleared her throat and grabbed her, \u201cDon\u2019t do that, don\u2019t do that. It would be useless, even if you went. Don\u2019t pull yourself into the ditch!\u201d From Zhang Ye\u2019s situation, people could tell that the politeness given to the star anchor by the station\u2019s Leader was only just pure courtesy. So what if you were a star anchor? Zhang Ye had also gotten the number one listenership rating! Wasn\u2019t he still suppressed by the station\u2019s Leader? When there was a conflict of interest with the station\u2019s Leader, no one else mattered. Everyone had to pave the way for them, letting their relatives take off!This was the status quo!After all, they had someone higher up!Zhang Ye was very touched, \u201cTeacher Xiaomei, thank you, but there\u2019s no need. You won\u2019t put any sense into them, no matter what you say. If the nomination will not be given by the station, fine\u2026 I\u2019ll get it myself!\u201dWang Xiaomei was shocked, \u201cYou get it yourself?\u201d\u201cWhere are you getting it from? Isn\u2019t it impossible without an anchor position?\u201d Big Sis Zhou could not understand, either.Zhang Ye did not respond to them. He picked up the cellphone on the table and stood up, \u201cI\u2019ll go out and make a call.\u201d He then disappeared out of the office.On the corner of the hallway.Zhang Ye opened the window and leaned on it. He flipped through his message book and found Zhang Yuanqi\u2019s telephone number. After pondering for a moment, he made the call. He was not a person who liked to beg for favors, at least he would not suddenly beg of people. If he could do it himself, Zhang Ye would do it himself. If he could not do it, then he would not do it; that was always his character. However, he did not have much pressure making this phone call. This was because Zhang Yuanqi had drunkenly gone to his house that day. Zhang Ye had taken care of her, washing her clothes and making food for her, so Zhang Yuanqi owed him one.Ring, ring, ring.Ring, ring, ring.Only after it rang ten times did the phone call connect.Zhang Ye quickly said, \u201cHello, Teacher Zhang. It\u2019s me, Zhang\u2026\u201dA magnetic voice from Zhang Yuanqi came over, but the tone was not very friendly, \u201cI know who you are. I\u2019m very busy now. I\u2019m giving you ten seconds to speak.\u201dZhang Ye was not taken aback. He had slowly gotten used to the Heavenly Queen\u2019s coldness. He knew that it was the Heavenly Queen\u2019s character deep down, and was not directed at him, \u201cThen I\u2019ll cut the long story short. It\u2019s like this. You are one of the five judges of the Silver Microphone Awards, right? My segment has been axed through the machinations of my station\u2019s Leader, so I cannot be nominated for the Silver Microphone Awards according to the rules. I heard judges have two additional nomination spots, *cough*, so I\u2019m asking if you can\u2026\u201dAt this moment, the ten seconds were up!Bada, the other side punctually hung up!Zhang Ye was surprised. Your sister! I haven\u2019t finished speaking! The ten seconds you said was really ten seconds? He nearly cursed at her mother, thinking how he would not care about her no matter how drunk she was in the future. If he saw her drunk at his place again, he would push her out on the road and write a plaque, \u201cTake a photo with the Heavenly Queen: 1,000 Yuan.\u201d This bro could earn some extra money!\u2026In the afternoon, \u201cSoaring Youth\u201d finished broadcasting.Jia Yan returned to his office and he stood straighter than ever before. He looked arrogant as the listenership rating had already been collated. It was 2.13% For a new segment, this result was quite brilliant! Jia Yan was very satisfied.Everyone knew that the next Silver Microphone Award for the Beijing Radio Station was guaranteed to be Jia Yan\u2019s. However, looking at his attitude, no one was was impressed. This was because he had not done it with his own abilities, and it was not because \u201cSoaring Youth\u201d was that good; the reason was that he had a good relative. Everyone knew deep down that axing Zhang Ye\u2019s segment forcefully without any notice was to help pull listeners for Jia Yan. How many listeners did Zhang Ye have? Ignoring \u201cSoaring Youth\u201d, even a program that wasn\u2019t even worth a fart would have a listenership rating of 2%!Someone who had no ability sure appeared impressive!Some average person could receive the Silver Microphone Award!Yet a huge contributor like Zhang Ye had been forced into such a pathetic state! He was not even given a nomination! They were really brutal and cold-blooded, confusing right with wrong!The nomination deadline was in the afternoon!Now, Teacher Little Zhang was completely out of the race!Big Sis Zhou\u2019s hands were trembling with anger. It was too unfair!Jia Yan and the News Channel\u2019s Zh\u0101ng Y\u011b knew each other well. They knew each other due to their elders\u2019 connection. Seeing Zh\u0101ng Y\u011b getting the Silver Microphone Award, while Zhang Ye got nothing, Jia Yan also felt his anger vent.It was almost time to get off work.A tall and thin youth suddenly entered the office.\u201cYan, let\u2019s go. Let\u2019s have dinner together.\u201d The youth said to Jia Yan.Jia Yan smiled upon seeing the person, \u201cZh\u0101ng Y\u011b? Sure. Wait for me to pack my things.\u201dNo one was surprised that the two knew each other. Both of them were products of nepotism, so it was inevitable that they knew each other.Zh\u0101ng Y\u011b was also curious about the identity of Zhang Ye. Looking around, he saw him at a glance. The Mid-Autumn Poetry Meet had been a big deal, and he had seen Zhang Ye\u2019s photo before. He has just this much looks and height? They\u2019re only average! Zh\u0101ng Y\u011b was already sure that he would win the Silver Microphone Award, so he looked down on Zhang Ye.Zhang Ye also looked at him.The two of them locked eyes, while Zh\u0101ng Y\u011b let out a laugh, showcasing the power of the victor.At this moment, Zhang Ye\u2019s assistant, Xiaofang, suddenly shouted. It was unknown what serious matter had happened. She pointed towards the computer, \u201cOh, hey! Come and see, quickly! Everyone, come and see! The Silver Microphone Awards nomination list has been released!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Hence, all the announcements and name lists were published on the television station\u2019s official website, including the nomination list announcement.What Xiaofang saw was clearly this!But no one understood why she was making a fuss!\u201cCome quickly!\u201d Xiaofang was still shouting, \u201cThis\u2026This\u2026\u201dBig Sis Zhou snapped, \u201cWhat big shot list? Without Little Zhang, what\u2019s there to see!\u201dBut Xiaofang shouted with even more exaggeration. Quite a lot of people gathered around, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Let me see.\u201dUpon taking a closer look, a second person also immediately called out, \u201cWhat the f***! Why is there Teacher Zhang Ye\u2019s name!? Am I seeing things?\u201dZhang Ye\u2019s name?Why was his name there?Auntie Sun also ran over in disbelief. She then said with excitement, \u201cThere\u2019s Little Zhang! There really is Little Zhang!\u201dJia Yan was shocked, \u201cHow can that be? Did you see wrongly?\u201dZh\u0101ng Y\u011b\u2019s expression also changed. What? Didn\u2019t the station recommend him as its sole nominee?Wang Xiaomei also came over, \u201cLittle Zhang does not have an anchor duty temporarily, so the station should not be able to nominate him, right? Also, who would nominate him?\u201d Zhang Ye had offended the Leader, so even if he was qualified to get the nomination, one of the Leaders would definitely think of a way to get him out of the way!Xiaofang said with a pleasant surprise, \u201cIt\u2019s not recommended by our Beijing Radio Station! It\u2019s recommended by one of the five judges for the Golden Microphone Awards! Someone gave Teacher Zhang Ye a Silver Microphone Awards additional nomination!\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d\u201cThe jury?\u201d\u201cAn exception was made to nominate him?\u201dBig Sis Zhou said in a surprised manner, \u201cWhy would the jury give Little Zhang a nomination? Out of the five judges, three of them have three additional nominations for the Golden Microphone Awards. The other two people would have the two additional nominations for the Silver Microphone Awards. That is to say, one of the judges has helped Teacher Little Zhang?\u201dMany people looked at each other, for they could not react in time!To think that they were were worried over Teacher Little Zhang. Take a look. Zhang Ye himself had someone up there!Zhang Ye heard this and felt a burden lift off his chest. He was really shocked. Just now when he called Zhang Yuanqi, he thought Old Zhang would not have bothered with him. She had hung up on him. But who knew that Comrade Old Zhang was so reliable? She had immediately set things right for him. She was righteous!\u2026At the same time.Deputy Station Head Jia\u2019s office.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with the name list?\u201d Deputy Station Head Jia said with a blackened face to his secretary.The secretary had a wailful expression, \u201cLeader, I only recommended Zh\u0101ng Y\u011b alone to the jury. There was no mistake. Maybe it is one of the additional nominations from the jury.\u201d\u201cAdditional?\u201d Deputy Station Head Jia immediately confirmed it on the website. And indeed it was true. He waved his hand, \u201cGo out and close the door!\u201dThe secretary walked out gingerly. He knew the Leader was mad.Deputy Station Head Jia called someone he knew on the jury, \u201cHey, Old Zheng, what\u2019s the meaning of this?\u201dThe middle-aged man on the phone had a husky voice, as if his vocal cords had been injured, \u201cOld Jia, I was just about to contact your radio station. I only just got to know about the nomination matters. Do not worry. There\u2019s no other meaning to it, nor are we trying to beat on your radio station. From what I know, someone from the jury submitted this nomination. The other judges had to give that person face, so we have such a list.\u201dDeputy Station Head Jia asked, \u201cWhich judge?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know about that.\u201d Head Zheng said.Deputy Station Head Jia said angrily, \u201cBut in the eyes of others, you are smacking our Beijing Radio Station\u2019s management\u2019s face. We have only nominated one person, and did not nominate a second person because there was no one suitable. But with you doing this, isn\u2019t it saying that our radio station is failing to recognize someone for his worth? For us to not discover him, despite having a good candidate\u2026 Wouldn\u2019t that mean that we needed someone from the jury to nominate him for us? How would the other stations look at us??\u201dHe had clearly caused the present situation due to his private goals, yet he said everything as if he was right!Head Zheng explained, \u201cDon\u2019t be stressed. There\u2019s really no way to control this matter. As a small Head, I can\u2019t do anything with the nomination from the higher-ups.\u201dAccording to the rules, additional nominations could be given freely.However, in principle, these nominations were not given willy-nilly. This was also the reason why Deputy Station Head Jia was angered.In the past, the jury and the broadcast stations had a tacit understanding. Most of the time, the jury would not use the additional nomination. When it was used, it was because the broadcasting station had too many good newcomers, despite only being able to nominate two. Only then would they need the additional nomination from the judges, to give those who weren\u2019t recommended a nomination, as a form of encouragement. Yes, it was a form of encouragement. This was because there was no precedent of a person winning the award with the additional nomination. It was just a symbolic nomination as an encouragement. They would not award the person who was given an additional nomination.Why?This was because the jury not only had to consider the qualities and abilities of the broadcasting host, they had to also take into account the views and attitudes of the unit the person worked at. And since there were two nominations from a station, these two people indicated the opinion of the station, so the jury would usually respect it, and naturally would not consider the additional nominations.But even so, Deputy Station Head Jia was still filled with anger. Anyone who had eyes could see Zhang Ye\u2019s results. He had broken so many records and made new history. Even other radio stations from other provinces might know of Zhang Ye\u2019s name. But Zhang Ye had not been nominated by their station. So anyone with eyes would know the attitude of their station, which was not wanting Zhang Ye to be up for nomination. But now? An unknown judge had pulled Zhang Ye into the nomination list! Wasn\u2019t this a smack in their faces? Who was it?Could it be Teacher Lu? Impossible! Teacher Lu\u2019s additional nomination should be for the Golden Microphone Award.The person with the Silver Microphone Award nomination had to be a new judge. Could it be the famous Heavenly Queen? That was more impossible! How could Zhang Ye know Zhang Yuanqi!?The phone was hung up.Zh\u0101ng Y\u011b knocked on the door and entered, \u201cStation Head Jia, about the nomination\u2026\u201dDeputy Station Head Jia suppressed his anger and got over it, \u201cIt\u2019s alright. It\u2019s just a little bump. You are recommended by the station, so the Silver Microphone Award is definitely yours. You don\u2019t have to worry.\u201dOnly then did Zh\u0101ng Y\u011b heave a sigh of relief before saying, \u201cWhat is he trying to do? He found someone to give him a nomination? Isn\u2019t this openly challenging the unit?\u201d\u201cGo back.\u201d Deputy Station Head Jia did not say much. He had already given Zhang Ye the death sentence in his heart. You even dare take the station down a peg; do you even have any concept of a bigger picture!?Some people were like that. Even though they were the one repressing others with their power, fixing anyone they wished, they did not allow the other party to fight back. There was no consideration when they abused their powers. They were always unreasonable. But when the other party resisted, they would respond with a ton of logic! In short, they would never be wrong. Whatever they did was the truth.All the fault was on Zhang Ye! It was Zhang Ye that should not have been born in this world! Against such a person, Zhang Ye would usually only say this to them\u2014Helping those bunch of ungrateful crap that thought the world revolved around them, then go f*** yourself!\u2026After work.His colleagues left the unit in pairs or trios.Big Sis Zhou said happily, \u201cLittle Zhang, you have a chance this time.\u201dHowever, Auntie Sun pessimistically said, \u201cThere\u2019s still no chance. According to what I know, additional nominations will never win the award.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Big Sis Zhou did not understand, \u201cThere\u2019s such a thing?\u201d\u201cIt has always been so. The judges will follow the unit\u2019s opinion.\u201d Auntie Sun said, \u201cBut this is enough. It is also a smack of the Station Leader\u2019s face. Little Zhang has at least been able to vent out some of his anger!\u201dEnough?It\u2019s far from enough!After having been repressed so much, Zhang Ye would not take this lying down!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Countless numbers of people crowded outside the Beijing Television Station\u2019s Grand Theater. They were lining up with their entry tickets.The moment that Zhang Ye came, he saw his colleagues.\u201cLittle Zhang, over here!\u201d Big Sis Zhou waved from the group.\u201cBig Sis Zhou? Auntie Sun?\u201d Zhang Ye blinked before walking forward.Auntie Sun let him cut in line. She thickened her Beijing accent, \u201cCome over quickly. There\u2019s no need to line up behind everyone.\u201dZhang Ye did not feel bad about cutting in line, since he was nominated. He did not need to line up and could just show his work pass to enter. \u201cWhy is everyone here?\u201d He really did not know that there would be so many people coming, as he had not gone to work the past few days. He had been fired from \u201cLate-night Ghost Stories\u201d, and \u201cOld and Young Story Club\u201d was still halted, so he did not have any work to do. Zhao Guozhou also took into account Zhang Ye\u2019s mood, so he made an exception to let Zhang Ye take a few days off.\u201cThese are tickets from the unit. There are many seats in the Grand Theater. Almost all our colleagues are here. Look \u2013 Tian Bin and his wife are right in front. See them? They are near security, and Teacher Xiaomei came early and is already inside. We actually came late.\u201d Big Sis Zhou said laughingly.Auntie Sun said in a comforting fashion, \u201cLittle Zhang, just relax today and don\u2019t think about anything else.\u201dBig Sis Zhou also cheered him on, \u201cRight. It\u2019s alright if you don\u2019t get it this time. There are still chances in the future. Just treat it as watching a show.\u201dZhang Ye said untruthfully, \u201cI understand.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good. Let\u2019s go.\u201d It was their turn to go through security.Throwing his lighter into the trash can, Zhang Ye passed through security and entered with them.This was the largest venue that Beijing Television Station had. It could accommodate a thousand people. The seats for Zhang Ye\u2019s unit were arranged to the right of the front rows. It was pretty good. After all, their radio station was part of the Beijing Broadcasting Television Station. It was their turf, so they naturally had priority treatment. It was much better as compared to the other broadcasting stations from the other provinces. This was the home turf advantage.\u201cTeacher Little Zhang, you\u2019ve come?\u201cSis Zhou, you are too slow.\u201d\u201cLittle Chen, Little Xu, why are you so early?\u201dThe tickets for the Literature Channel were all in serial, so they naturally all sat together. Some came alone, while some brought their lovers. Some even brought their children.After greeting each other, everyone sat down.Right in front was the Beijing Radio Station\u2019s News Channel\u2019s seats. Zh\u0101ng Y\u011b was sitting in the first row. Clearly, it was for him to easily go onstage to receive his award. He had already made his preparations. At this moment, he turned around after being reminded. He looked at Zhang Ye and raised his hand with a smile to attract Zhang Ye\u2019s attention, \u201cZhang Ye.\u201d He was the same age as Zhang Ye, but had entered the station half a year earlier, so he did not use the salutation of \u201cTeacher\u201d.Zhang Ye looked over, \u201cOh?\u201dZh\u0101ng Y\u011b laughed, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you sitting in front? The both of us are nominated for our station.\u201d There was not too much of a problem with these words, but people felt uncomfortable hearing it.Everyone knew that Teacher Zhang Ye did not sit in the first row for nominees because he knew he would not win. Yet you had to rub it in? Aren\u2019t you doing this on purpose!?Zhang Ye said coldly, \u201cThere\u2019s no need.\u201d\u201cOh, suit yourself, then.\u201d Zh\u0101ng Y\u011b turned around.Jia Yan also happened to arrive at this moment. With his ticket in hand, he did not sit at the Literature Channel\u2019s area, and instead went to the News Channel\u2019s seats.\u201cZh\u0101ng Y\u011b.\u201d\u201cHi, Jia.\u201d\u201cThere was heavy traffic; that felt crappy.\u201d\u201cSit over here. I reserved a seat for you.\u201dJia Yan and Zh\u0101ng Y\u011b sat together. They chatted happily, as if there was no one else around them. Ever since Zhang Ye\u2019s matter was made known and Jia Yan got his program, many people felt demoralized, seeing the Station Leader\u2019s insidious schemes. Many people from the Literature Channel had excluded him from their circles, so Jia Yan decided not to make himself unwelcome. Since the colleagues from the Literature Channel did not value him, he did not value them, either. After all, with Deputy Station Head Jia, he could ignore anyone.Once upon a time, when Jia Yan just came, everyone was very polite and friendly to him. After all, he was a relative of the Leader. In contrast, Zhang Ye had been excluded for a period of time. But now, the situation had reversed itself. There was really a reason of degree. Some methods were too damaging. It may be Zhang Ye this time, but could it be someone else from their Literature Channel the next time, in order to make way for Jia Yan? Forced to their deaths by the Leader? People could not help but have such thoughts after this matter!Big Sis Zhou said to Zhang Ye, \u201cIgnore them.\u201d\u201cThose without abilities won\u2019t be jumping for long.\u201d Xiaofang also said hatefully.An old editor sighed, \u201cHai, the internal affairs of the unit is getting more messy these days.\u201dThis year\u2019s Silver Microphone Award for their station was definitely Zh\u0101ng Y\u011b\u2019s. There was no question that it would be Jia Yan\u2019s next year. So what if Zhang Ye had the ability? He could only bow down before others. Of course, those were the thoughts and judgments of others, and not Zhang Ye\u2019s. Zhang Ye had not given up!Compromise?Yield?Endure?That was completely not his style!He could only develop himself further in the television station by winning the Silver Microphone Award. But what did he need to do to win this award that he absolutely needed? Zhang Ye did not know. He was out of methods at this moment. Find Zhang Yuanqi? Impossible. The Heavenly Queen also had no way to change today\u2019s outcome. The jury was decided on a majority. Three votes out of the five judges would make it effective. Other than Zhang Yuanqi, who was a new judge, the other judges respected the rules. So no one would vote for Zhang Ye. So it was meaningless if Zhang Yuanqi helped Zhang Ye alone. Besides, Zhang Ye had already used her favor, so he could not seek Zhang Yuanqi\u2019s help anymore.He was at a loss!There was no way out and no way back!Zhang Ye had to admit that he was really backed into a corner. However, he needed to find a way out despite this impossible situation, for he could not swallow his anger!Routine methods were definitely ineffective. Zhang Ye opened his game ring\u2019s interface, hoping to find a method to break this quandary. These few days, with \u201cOld and Young Story Club\u201d halted, he could only count on \u201cGhost Blows Out the Light\u201d to increase his Reputation. However, that was all there was. Hence, he did not have much Reputation. If he played the Lottery\u2026Hey! I almost forgot!There was an item in the inventory that had not been used!Zhang Ye suddenly thought of it. He opened the game inventory and indeed, there was a shiny little thing inside. Lucky Bread! This was something that he had received a few days ago. He had eaten the Fruits of Charm that he had received from the Additional Stakes right there on the spot, so he had nearly forgotten about this item!Let\u2019s try it out!Let\u2019s try it as a last resort to save a hopeless situation!The Silver Microphone Award was about to be announced soon, so Zhang Ye had no other choice. He could only bet on this!He took out the Lucky Bread from his inventory. Holding an Ice World mineral water in his hand, which was a famous mineral water brand of this world, he pretended to drink the water, but was actually secretly eating the Lucky Bread. People could not see the items obtained from the game ring\u2019s Lottery, but people could still see Zhang Ye\u2019s actions. If he were to stuff thin air into his mouth and even chew, people would think he was crazy, so he had to have some cover up actions. Gulp. The last mouthful of bread was finished!Lucky Bread in Effect!Player's Luck state Increased!Countdown of five minutes begins!\u2026At the same moment.In the back, resting area three, inside the hall.There were five staff arranging the trophies and certificates to be awarded today. Yesterday, the results were actually decided, so the certificates and trophies were quickly produced. There were Golden Microphones and Silver Microphones. They were all placed on a table. The door was locked. It was a strictly confidential process. However, although it was so to speak, confidential, this sort of thing was impossible to keep a secret. Anyone in the industry would be able to understand who would win or lose. Furthermore, it wasn\u2019t the election of a President, so it was not that strict.\u201cName \u2013 Liu Feng.\u201d\u201cOver here.\u201d\u201cAlright, place it in front. The certificate has to correspond to it. Don\u2019t mess up.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. It can\u2019t go wrong.\u201d\u201cZh\u0101ng Y\u011b, this is one of the winners of the Silver Microphone. Take it in front and send it over in a while.\u201d\u201cAlright, it\u2019s ready.\u201dBut just as the few staff were arranging the order according to the name list, without any forewarning, a female employee accidentally knocked into a certificate. Pa Da, the certificate flipped, pushing down a mineral water bottle that was mysteriously placed on the table. The cap covered the top, but it was not tightly sealed, so momentarily, water spilled onto that certificate. It was all very sudden!\u201cAh ya!\u201d The female employee hurriedly wiped the certificate with her sleeve.\u201cDon\u2019t rub it!\u201d An old comrade beside cautioned, but it was too late.With this rub, the paper on the certificate turned into a mess. The words could no longer be read.A youth quickly came over to help, quickly wiping the water off the table and onto the ground, so as to not to affect the other certificates. However, the floor was made of glazed tiles, so with water it became very slippery. The youth nearly slipped, but although he did not crash to the ground, he had still pressed on the table with his hand to stabilize himself, and thus he had touched the corresponding trophy to that certificate. The trophy crashed to the ground amidst their panicking eyes!The trophy shattered!The Silver Microphone Award trophy was different in quality compared to the Golden Microphone Award. It may be a Silver Microphone Award, but it was actually made of something similar to crystal. It was in the shape of a microphone. And since the toughness of crystal was not that much stronger than glass, it ended up shattering. Even its real mother wouldn\u2019t recognize it!\u201cAh!\u201d\u201cBad, bad!\u201d\u201cWhat are you doing!? How can you be so careless?\u201d\u201cSorry, sorry. I didn\u2019t know that it would turn into such a mess!\u201dEveryone began running helter-skelter. After that mishap, there was no other way, as there was such a huge mess!\u201cUncle Ping, what do we do? There\u2019s still another hour before the Silver Microphone will be awarded!\u201d The female employee was worried. She had never expected that they would screw up such a simple job!The Silver Microphone Awards were what was first awarded in the morning. As it was not a live broadcast, it was considered a warm up for the Golden Microphone Awards. Only after the Silver Microphone Awards were given out would the Golden Microphone Awards be broadcast live on television. There was indeed not much time left. There was no way the Silver Microphone Awards would be placed after the Golden Microphone Awards, as there had never been such a precedent!The oldest employee gritted his teeth, \u201cDon\u2019t panic. We can still make it in time. The certificate is easy. We still have blank, ready-made certificates. Just filling it in would do. The judges would definitely have an official seal on their side. Little Chen, go get the seal from the judges. Little Wang, I\u2019ll give you a task. Immediately call Yi Xuan. The trophies were produced by his company. I\u2019m sure they still have backup Silver Microphone Award trophies. The name is blank, so get them to engrave the name \u2018Zh\u0101ng Y\u011b\u2019 on it as soon as possible. Go get it yourself. Do it as soon as possible!\u201d\u201cAlright!\u201d\u201cUnderstood!\u201dThe two of them went out. One of them made a phone call, while the other made the certificate.The female employee first got Yi Xuan\u2019s number and hurriedly called, \u201cHello, this is the Beijing Television Station\u2026Yes, we have a situation here. Can I ask if there is still a Silver Microphone Award trophy\u2026There is? That\u2019s great, that\u2019s great. Please help us make the name again. One of them was shattered\u2026Yes\u2026Thank you very much. Please do it quickly, or it will not be in time\u2026 Alright\u2026 The name? The name is Zhang\u2026\u201d Being in a hurry, she had forgotten the name that the old comrade had told her as she said into the phone, \u201cHold on!\u201dThe youth had already taken out a certificate and was about to fill it in.The female employee immediately asked, \u201cLittle Chen, what\u2019s that person\u2019s name?\u201d\u201cUh, the unit is the Beijing Radio Station, I think it\u2019s Zhang.. Y\u011b?\u201d The youth was also not certain and did not feel comfortable asking Uncle Ping again, for fear of being reprimanded. Hence, he quickly searched for the nomination list on his phone. \u201cOh, I found it. Beijing Radio Station, it\u2019s this; his name is Zhang Ye!\u201d\u201cWhich Ye?\u201d\u201cTake a look for yourself.\u201d\u201cAlright, I\u2019ve written it down.\u201dThe pronunciation of Zhang Ye and Zh\u0101ng Y\u011b was about the same. They were both \u201cYe\u201d, just that there was a slightly different tone.The youth used a pen and wrote down the name from the internet.The female employee also told the trophy makers, \u201cIt\u2019s Zhang Ye (\u5f20\u70e8)\u2026 It\u2019s written with a \u706b and a \u534e. His unit is the Beijing Radio Station!\u201dChapter 74: The Awardee\u2019s Name has been Messed Up!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Almost everyone was here.At this moment, the game ring on Zhang Ye\u2019s pinky displayed a screen with virtual text.Countdown ended\u00a0\u2013 the Lucky Bread was used up!Five minutes have passed?It\u2019s over? Just like that?Zhang Ye blinked his eyes in a daze. He looked to the left and then to the right. Why didn\u2019t anything happen? It increased my Luck stat? Where was it increased? I couldn\u2019t see a bit of it! This was the first time that the special items from Zhang Ye\u2019s game ring did not have any effect. He was extremely depressed. He was originally hoping that the \u201cLucky Bread\u201d would help him, and it was also his final life-saving weapon, but who knew that nothing happened at all. At least let this bro pick up a wallet to show its effects!Unlucky!There was not a chance left now!Zhang Ye was at a loss as to whether to laugh or to cry. He had choked at the critical moment!Over there, the Literature Channel\u2019s old editor, who had become the eldest after Teacher Feng retired, returned. He had not been seen all along, for he had gone somewhere.\u201cYou just came?\u201d someone asked.The old editor said, \u201cI came much earlier. I just went to find a friend backstage.\u201dBig Sis Zhou was excited, \u201cYou know people here? Are the decisions for the awards out?\u201d\u201cIt came out earlier on.\u201d The old editor said, \u201cThere was something happening backstage. Don\u2019t tell others that I was the one who told you. I heard that one of the trophies shattered from dropping.\u201dAuntie Sun exclaimed, \u201cThen wouldn\u2019t they not make it in time?\u201dThe old editor said, \u201cThe company manufacturing the trophy must have spares. By quickly engraving the unit and the name of the winner, it\u2019s quite fast. They should be able to make it in time.\u201dNobody took this news in mind.Big Sis Zhou asked again, \u201cThen who will win our station\u2019s Silver Microphone Award?\u201dThe old editor said helplessly , \u201cYou are still hoping for Little Zhang to create a miracle? It\u2019s impossible. The additional nomination will not win the award. There has been no precedent, and neither will there be one in the future.\u201dBig Sis Zhou rolled her eyes, \u201cI know that. I\u2019m asking if Zh\u0101ng Y\u011b got it. It\u2019s said that every year our radio station will get one Golden Microphone Award and one Silver Microphone Award, but wasn\u2019t there a mistake five years ago with the Golden Microphone Award, where both our station\u2019s nominees were not awarded, and it was awarded to Hebei province\u2019s broadcaster?\u201d She could no longer stand seeing Zhang Ye being bullied to such a state. Since Zhang Ye could not get it, then it was best that Zh\u0101ng Y\u011b did not get it as well. It could vent her anger. Seeing Zh\u0101ng Y\u011b and Jia Yan\u2019s overbearing manner from before was annoying!The other colleagues also looked over.The old editor gave a wry smile, \u201cHow can there be so many accidents. I heard from my friend that he happened to see the award certificates yesterday. Our station\u2019s Silver Microphone Award winner is Zh\u0101ng Y\u011b.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s already decided?\u201d Big Sis Zhou still remained adamant.\u201cIt was decided yesterday afternoon.\u201d The old editor said, \u201cIt\u2019s him. My friend saw it with his own eyes. The trophy even has Zh\u0101ng Y\u011b\u2019s name on it, so how can it be wrong?\u201dBig Sis Zhou tutted.With so many colleagues worried for him, Zhang Ye felt quite heart-warmed. He had never seen a good unit or a good Leader, but he had met a group of cute colleagues, making him feel blessed.\u201cHey! That\u2019s Teacher Cheng! The eighth Golden Microphone Award winner!\u201d\u201cAiyah, even this round\u2019s Teacher Zhou is a guest? Although he had long retired, but he was the number one brother of the hosting world. Who could compete with him back then?\u201d\u201cThat is Auntie Qu! My idol and goal! I watched her program while growing up!\u201dThe important show was at the back as heavy-weight big shots began to enter. There were top hosts from years ago, and also current top hosts. There were Leaders from the broadcasting stations and also the judges. The moment they entered, they stirred up a commotion. Other than some established people from various industries who were invited to be in the audience through a lottery, the other people were all hosts from various television and radio stations. In front of so many sage-like predecessors and former idols, people were extremely excited. They were the direction people were fighting towards!However, when the last figure appeared, people\u2019s emotions weren\u2019t excited anymore, but explosive. The entire venue resounded into a earth-shattering uproar!\u201cZhang Yuanqi!\u201d\u201cZhang Yuanqi!\u201d\u201cAh! I see Auntie Yuanqi!\u201d\u201cSis Zhang! I love you forever!\u201dMany staff of the television and radio stations did not make a big fuss, for they were in this industry, so they would not craze over celebrities. Even if they crazed over someone, they would do it for a top figure in the hosting world. Zhang Yuanqi may have been an excellent host in the past, but she was after all not professionally doing it, hence people were relatively calm.However, the other audience members could not be suppressed! Many people stood up! They raised their signs and light sticks as they roared Zhang Yuanqi\u2019s name! They did not care about the Golden or the Silver Microphone Awards! They were here for the Heavenly Queen!Zhang Yuanqi appeared from the side stage. She had initially wanted to take a seat, but seeing the audience shouting so enthusiastically, she waved with a smile at everyone!\u201cAh! Sis Zhang smiled at me!\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you make a mistake!? Sis Zhang was smiling at me!\u201d\u201cSis Zhang, you are too beautiful! I love you to death!\u201d\u201cSing a song, Sis Zhang! I want to hear \u2018I Don\u2019t Believe\u2019!\u201dThe situation went out of control. There were even fans rushing up to get her signature. Many reporters charged up to take pictures!More than ten security guards, who were standing by to maintain order, immediately came to fend off people. They finally managed to control the situation. It was tiring enough!Zhang Ye and his radio station colleagues were secretly surprised!This was a Heavenly Queen! This was the current number one sister of the entertainment industry! This appearance showed the apparent gap! The number of fans was completely of a different grade compared to star hosts! It was estimated that all the fans of the star hosts present added up were far smaller in number than Zhang Yuanqi\u2019s alone!Zhang Yuanqi sat in the first row. People could no longer see her, as they were facing her back, so the shouts slowly stopped.\u201cThe Heavenly Queen sure is beautiful.\u201d the old editor praised.Big Sis Zhou also said, \u201cYeah, better looking than in the movies.\u201dAuntie Sun said, \u201cI also like her movies. She\u2019s good at singing, too. Her voice has a magnetic charm and metamorphic charm to it. No one in the current entertainment industry can compete with that mature and gentle charm that she has!\u201dA Literature Channel youth sighed and said, \u201cYes, Sis Zhang is really like a giant panda in the entertainment industry. Other Heavenly Queens and Kings can be replaced, for they look good and are good at acting, but Zhang Yuanqi is definitely someone who cannot be replaced. She represents a generation!\u201dEveryone\u2019s evaluation of her was very high.Tian Bin and Zh\u0101ng Y\u011b, who were in front, also looked towards Zhang Yuanqi.Maybe some people did not craze over Zhang Yuanqi, and some people had controversies with Zhang Yuanqi\u2019s works, but no one could deny that wherever Zhang Yuanqi was, she would forever be the main lead!\u2026Onstage.A host went up. This person seemed to be from the News Channel from the Beijing Television Station. He was not very famous, but everyone found him familiar.\u201cHello, everyone. Welcome to this year\u2019s Beijing Television Station\u2019s live broadcast of the Golden Microphone Awards. He did not introduce the guests and judges, because it still wasn\u2019t a live broadcast. Those were lines only said during the live broadcast. \u201cThere is still half an hour\u2019s time before the Golden Microphone Awards. According to established practices, now is the time for the awarding of the Silver Microphone Awards. First, let me announce this year\u2019s Silver Microphone Awards nominees.\u201d\u201cBeijing Television Station \u2013 Chen Bin! Yan Qi!\u201d\u201cHebei Television Station \u2013 Lu Mei! Huo Dongyan!\u201d\u201cJinshi Television Station \u2013 Chen Tao! Zhang Yang!\u201d\u2026\u201cBeijing Radio Station \u2013 Zh\u0101ng Y\u011b, Zhang Ye!\u201d\u201cShanghai Radio Station \u2013 Su Leilei! Li Bang!\u201d\u2026After each nominee\u2019s name was announced, the host began to announce the first winner, \u201cNext, I will announce the winner of this year\u2019s Silver Microphone Awards\u2019 television host award, Beijing Television Station\u2019s Yan Qi!\u201dEveryone applauded.A female host seemed very surprised as she quickly rushed onto the stage while covering her mouth to accept the award.The person handing the award to her was one of the five judges, Teacher Cheng. He was an old senior of the broadcasting world.The awards host laughed, \u201cCongratulations to Yan Qi. She is almost my colleague. Little Qi, this occasion is quite magnificent. With so many seniors sitting below, do you have something to say?\u201dYan Qi took over the microphone, \u201cThank you. Only thank you. Thank you everyone for your help! Thank you everyone for your recognition!\u201dNext.Then the next.The announcement of the winners of the ten television hosts awards quickly came to an end. Other than a few people having longer acceptance speeches, there was no delay. Next was the Silver Microphone Awards for radio hosts. They were also for ten people. However, at this moment, it was cut back to the host, to hear him say, \u201cNext will be the radio station broadcasting Silver Microphone Awards. Let me invite my colleague Zhang Huo from the Beijing Radio Station to announce it.\u201d After he walked down, Zhang Huo came up with a smile.Zhang Huo was no stranger to Zhang Ye. Back at the Mid-Autumn Poetry Meet, he was also one of the hosts. He was a winner of their station\u2019s Golden Microphone Award many years ago. Since this award ceremony was organized by the Beijing Television Station, he had the qualification to do it, even if he wasn\u2019t very famous in the industry.Zhang Huo came onto the stage, \u201cHello, everyone. I\u2019m Zhang Huo.\u201d At such a big occasion, with so many seniors and Leaders around, he also seemed slightly nervous. After all, he was just a radio station\u2019s news-related broadcaster, so his fame was definitely incomparable to other television stations\u2019 hosts. \u201cThank you for the Leader\u2019s trust for me to host this Radio Station Silver Microphone Awards. Next, I will announce the first winner of the ten awards.\u201dHe flipped open the certificate and announced, \u201cCentral Radio Station, Gong Xu!\u201dImmersed in the applause, Gong Xu excitedly went up on stage. Zhang Yuanqi took over the trophy from a member of the staff. It was her turn to give out the award.\u201cCongratulations.\u201d Zhang Yuanqi gave a warm smile.Gong Xu received it with an expression of shock, \u201cThank you, Teacher Zhang. Thank you to the jury. I will continue to work hard. I will not put this trophy to shame!\u201dZhang Yuanqi smiled, \u201cYou\u2019ve already done very well.\u201dZhang Huo smiled, \u201cLet\u2019s give a round of applause to Teacher Gong.\u201dBeijing Radio Station\u2019s Station Head and Deputy Station Head Jia were in the first row. They applauded the winner.Next, Zhang Huo announced another person from the Central Radio Station. Zhang Yuanqi did not get offstage. She took the trophy and handed it to him, congratulating him.Offstage.Big Sis Zhou was not feeling an emotional high, \u201cIt\u2019s almost already time for our radio station.\u201dWang Xiaomei looked unsurely at Zhang Ye, \u201cAre you alright?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Zhang Ye pretended to look indifferent. Actually, it would be weird if he was fine. This award was extremely important to him!Auntie Sun patted Zhang Ye on the shoulder, \u201cLet\u2019s not bother ourselves arguing with the likes of them.\u201dSuddenly, Zhang Huo\u2019s voice came again, \u201cNext is the third Silver Microphone Award. The result of the jury is\u2026\u201d Upon saying this, Zhang Huo suddenly paused. His words were still stuck in his throat. He had opened the certificate and remained silent for a long while. He looked with an unsure gaze offstage, with a questioning gaze.Deputy Station Head Jia frowned, \u201cCarry on reading.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the meaning of this?\u201d The Beijing Radio Station\u2019s Station Head also pulled a long face. This was organized by them, and Zhang Huo was from their radio station. Even though it was not a live broadcast, he should not have made such a low-level error. Wasn\u2019t this embarrassing their radio station for a host to lose his focus?\u201c\u201dEh?\u201d\u201cWhy isn\u2019t he speaking?\u201d\u201cWho\u2019s next? He\u2019s not announcing it?\u201dZh\u0101ng Y\u011b was already waiting offstage to receive his award. He knew he was next.The few people from the jury were also wondering what he was doing. Hence, they gave Zhang Huo a stern expression to tell him to carry on!Zhang Huo breathed in deeply. Seeing the Leader and jury members having such expressions, he could only read, \u201cThe next winner of the Silver Microphone Awards is Beijing Radio Station\u2019s\u2026Zhang Ye!\u201dIn the beginning, no one realized it.Zh\u0101ng Y\u011b, who was in the front row, smiled and got up.Zhang Huo hurriedly waved at him not to go onstage. He said to his News Channel colleague, \u201cIt\u2019s not you. It\u2019s.. Zhang Ye!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Everyone looked disbelievingly at Zhang Huo, thinking that he had made a mistake!However, Zhang Huo looked seriously at the award certificate in his hands, and with great care and confirmation, read once again, \u201cThis year\u2019s Silver Microphone Award winner\u2026 Zhang Ye!\u201dHe articulated his words very clearly!It was Ye! Not Y\u011b!Deputy Station Head Jia was stunned!The Station Head\u2019s face turned black!Everyone from the Beijing Radio Station made an uproar!Xiaofang almost jumped up. She grabbed Zhang Ye and shook him hard, \u201cHeavens! It\u2019s you! Teacher Zhang, it\u2019s you!\u201dZhang Ye was in a daze, \u201cMe?\u201dAuntie Sun widened her mouth, \u201cHow did it become Zhang Ye?\u201cI don\u2019t know, either.\u201d Zhang Ye wasn\u2019t sure himself.\u201cIt\u2019s you! He has already read your name twice!\u201d Big Sis Zhou was happy all of a sudden. She gave Zhang Ye a hard push, \u201cHaha! Stop looking silly there! Quick go on stage to receive the award!\u201dThe old editor also urged in a whisper, \u201cNo matter what, just go up first!\u201d\u201cRight, first get the award before speaking. Even if the staff made a mistake, it will be too late to change who gets it at that point!\u201d Big Sis Zhou came up with a rotten idea.Zhang Ye was about to stand up, but he was stopped.A staff member suddenly ran onto the stage to communicate with the host, and then took the award certificate from his hands.Next, Zhang Huo waved his hand at Zhang Ye, \u201cTeacher Zhang, wait a while. The jury has asked for a pause. I think there\u2019s been a mistake.\u201d Following that, he said to everyone present, \u201cSorry, everyone. We have a situation on our hands. Please wait for the jury\u2019s review.\u201dThe other people did not know what was happening and also waited to see a show play out before their eyes.The five judges were already in discussion. Besides them, there were other staff members gathered together.Deputy Station Head Jia went over to take a look and also came together with the Station Head to understand the situation. What had happened? It was clearly supposed to be Zh\u0101ng Y\u011b. They had even seen Zh\u0101ng Y\u011b\u2019s trophy. But why did the announcement suddenly change to Zhang Ye? Wasn\u2019t this nonsense!? There was no precedent of additional nominations winning an award! Not even once!\u201cWhere\u2019s the award certificate?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s here. Take a look. It\u2019s written \u2018Zhang Ye\u2019.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s definitely not him. It should be the Beijing Radio Station\u2019s Zh\u0101ng Y\u011b.\u201d\u201cAh? Then why is it this name in the award certificate? That\u2019s not right. The trophy is here, too. It\u2019s also engraved \u2018Zhang Ye\u2019. There\u2019s no mistake.\u201d\u201cEven on the trophy was written \u2018Zhang Ye\u2019?\u201d\u201cCan someone tell me what is happening?\u201d\u201cTeachers, this might be the fault of my people.\u201d\u201cQu Ping, what are you talking about?\u201d\u201cJust now backstage, one of my staff members spilled some water and the award certificate could not be used. The trophy also shattered from falling, so I got them to get a spare from the manufacturer. But.. they might have heard the names wrongly. Zhang Ye and Zh\u0101ng Y\u011b sound quite alike.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean by this?\u201d\u201cHow can this happen?\u201d\u201cThen how are we to present the award?\u201d\u201cThe names are all written as Zhang Ye, so should we present it now or not?\u201dAt this moment, the Beijing Radio Station\u2019s Station Head interrupted their conversation, \u201cEven if it\u2019s wrong, it should still be presented to Zh\u0101ng Y\u011b. This was decided by the jury, so how can we change it?\u201dAn old judge looked at him, \u201cWe already announced it, so how do we take it back?\u201dDeputy Station Head Jia knew that Zh\u0101ng Y\u011b had to get this Silver Microphone Award, for he was the only son of the Station Head\u2019s old war comrade. Hence, he said, \u201cSince it\u2019s an error made by the jury staff, we shouldn\u2019t have it affect our station\u2019s newcomer award winner because of this! That would be too unfair for Zh\u0101ng Y\u011b! You can\u2019t do that!\u201d Fairness? When they were pushing Zhang Ye to a cliff, refusing to give him a nomination, they had never thought of the meaning of fairness. But now, once it affected their own interests and relations, they began shouting about fairness!The old judge was very unhappy with their tone. In terms of qualifications, he was an old veteran in the circle, and was one grade more senior than the Station Head and Deputy Station Head Jia. \u201cIsn\u2019t Zhang Ye from your radio station, too?\u201dDeputy Station Head Jia flatly said, \u201cNo way can it be Zhang Ye! It has to be Zh\u0101ng Y\u011b!\u201dOne of the five judges, a younger judge, stared at Deputy Station Head Jia, \u201cPlease keep your tone down and don\u2019t scare us again. Now that we are discussing how to resolve the matter, must we go to the point of making such a fuss? Zhang Ye and Zh\u0101ng Y\u011b are both comrades from your radio station. I have some impression of Zhang Ye. If I remember correctly, his results are much better than Zh\u0101ng Y\u011b\u2019s, right? So this should not be a huge difference for your radio station.\u201dThe judge\u2019s tone had changed. They seemed to have the intention to leave the mistake uncorrected and make the best of it.Actually, Zh\u0101ng Y\u011b was chosen by them. Among the five, four votes were given to Zh\u0101ng Y\u011b, while one abstained. Under normal circumstances, the jury would of course respect the views of the radio station, but the problem now was that the circumstances were now not normal. The trophy and certificate were all wrong, and even the host had announced the wrong name. It was not easy to deal with this situation. And with the Golden Microphone Awards about to be broadcast live, where did they have the time to make a new trophy for Zh\u0101ng Y\u011b?\u201cBut\u2026\u201d the Station Head said with a long face.The old judge said, \u201cWe will take it into consideration. Can those who are uninvolved please return to your seats?\u201dThe Station Head could not say certain things, so Deputy Station Head Jia decided to say it, \u201cThis Zhang Ye has a character problem. That\u2019s why our station did not recommend him. He definitely doesn\u2019t deserve to win this award!\u201dAs their voices were a bit loud, and Zhang Ye was sitting in the front area, and was pretty close by, he could hear clearly what the Deputy Station Head said!I have a character problem?I don\u2019t deserve this trophy?Zhang Ye laughed from extreme anger. He never expected that these so-called Leaders would not only trample on him for no good reason and push him aside, they would even smear him now!The old judge looked at Zhang Yuanqi, who was still onstage smiling and chatting with the host, before looking at Deputy Station Head Jia\u2019s eyes, \u201cCharacter problem? An exception was made for Zhang Ye\u2019s nomination by our jury. Are you questioning our jury\u2019s level or are you questioning our jury\u2019s basic distinguishing ability?\u201d Seeing that they still wanted to add on further, he waved his hands and put it to a stop, \u201cI\u2019ve already said that uninvolved people should please leave!\u201d\u2026Over here.Big Sis Zhou was straining her ears to listen, \u201cWhat are they saying?\u201dA Literature Channel\u2019s young editor said, \u201cI think they were saying the trophy broke from falling, and they wrote wrongly. That\u2019s all I heard.\u201dZhang Ye had naturally good ears, so he heard more than them. He had not missed a single word of what the two Station Heads said!\u201cThe trophy shattered?\u201d\u201cNo wonder! So this was written wrongly?\u201d\u201cHehe, I see. Zhang Ye and Zh\u0101ng Y\u011b are quite similar!\u201dEveryone finally understood. After all this time, it was a blunder!Blunder? At this moment, Zhang Ye finally understood. He had initially thought that the Lucky Bread had been ineffective, as he had not seen any effects. In fact, it was not ineffective, but it had happened without him knowing. He was sure that the shattering of the trophy, the messing up of the award certificate, and having the name written wrongly were definitely the effects that the Lucky Bread gave in those five minutes. If not, there was no way that such a thing could happen!All the mistakes happening together at the same time?If it was a coincidence, it was too exaggerated!Zhang Ye secretly touched his game ring. You sure helped me a lot this time!Wang Xiaomei looked at Zhang Ye who was two seats away, \u201cTeacher Little Zhang, I still do not know what magic you used? Such a thing can even happen?\u201dWang Xiaomei said out what was on everyone\u2019s mind!That\u2019s right! This can even happen? You can even make a comeback with this!?During his time in the station, Zhang Ye had never had a smooth-sailing experience. He was looked down upon the moment that he came. He was never appreciated. He later offended the Leader, and was repressed by the Leader. It could be said that he stumbled to the extreme.However, what made everyone speechless that despite all the dire situations, Zhang Ye had never suffered. He had managed to turn around every difficulty and problem that he encountered, saving the situation. He was godly!They were sure that Zhang Ye would definitely plant his face into the ground this time, but who knew that this would happen. He had managed to get his name announced in a manner that no one could believe!Big Sis Zhou laughed heartily, \u201cOur Little Zhang is full of luck!\u201dIn the back row, Tian Bin and his wife heard this. They were thinking, \u201cWhat darn good luck? He was more bad luck. Whoever stained themselves with him would end up unlucky.\u201d The bizarre sequence of events that happened in the office was still fresh in their minds. It was similar with this situation. The coincidences made people speechless!But it was still early to say that Zhang Ye had won the Silver Microphone Award, because the jury had not made their indication, so no one could guess the outcome!Zh\u0101ng Y\u011b\u2019s face tightened as Jia Yan spoke to and accompanied him.The Station Head and Deputy Station Head were sent back. They sat in their seats, silent. They stared unblinkingly at the people in the jury. This was not only about Zh\u0101ng Y\u011b not getting the award, it also had to do with their Beijing Radio Station\u2019s face. Although Zhang Ye was from their station, he was not nominated by them. Letting a newcomer that they had abandoned win the Silver Microphone Award? The few Leaders in the radio station could not afford to lose this amount of face!This was not just the smacking of the face!It was the trampling of the face! The kind that used feet to trample!They were all waiting for the jury\u2019s decision. The jury was still in urgent consideration, and had not made up their minds.However, a few minutes later, a few guests and audience members could not bear waiting. They did not understand what had happened, nor did they care if there was a problem. They did not give a damn who won the award!\u201cWhat the heck?\u201d\u201cAre they still handing out the award?\u201d\u201cHurry up! Sis Zhang has been waiting there for so long!\u201dThe few judges and staff members halted their exchange. The final words they said seemed to mean that they had come to a conclusion.A staff member immediately ran up to the podium and whispered to the host, Zhang Huo.Zhang Huo nodded slightly, as his lips moved without anyone knowing what he was to say. He then picked up his microphone, \u201cSorry for the wait. I will announce this award again.\u201dZhang Ye took a deep breath!Zh\u0101ng Y\u011b appeared full of anticipation!Both Big Sis Zhou and Auntie Sun balled their fists!The Station Head and Deputy Station Head Jia\u2019s faces looked solemn!This result had caused a lot of angst amongst many people\u2019s hearts. After Zhang Huo remained silent for a moment, he announced, \u201cThe winner of this year\u2019s Silver Microphone Award, Beijing Radio Station\u2019s\u2026Zhang Ye!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The Station Head and the Deputy Station Head\u2019s expressions were not much different from his. They felt like there was a stream of fire burning inside them that they could not vent! Zh\u0101ng Y\u011b had clearly been selected previously! It was clearly something that had been decided long ago! Why did it inexplicably become Zhang Ye\u2019s award?What the heck!?What is the meaning of this!?How can such a ridiculous situation happen?The other side had a different expression!Xiaofang was heard screaming, \u201cTeacher Zhang! It\u2019s really you! This time, it\u2019s really you!\u201dWang Xiaomei congratulated, \u201cCongratulations. Even if it was a blunder previously, now that the jury did not change the outcome, it has become reality. With the Silver Microphone Award, the path ahead of you will be much easier. This is a national-level award that is given alongside the Golden Microphone Awards. It\u2019s the highest honor and qualification for a rookie!\u201d\u201cBeautifully done!\u201d Big Sis Zhou slammed Zhang Ye\u2019s back heavily, \u201cEven the Heavens have helped you!\u201dOnly Zhang Ye knew that it was not because of Heaven, but because he had used the game ring to reverse the situation!The Station Head had risen from his seat and stared at the people from the jury. He did not speak, but managed to express his great dissatisfaction with his eyes!Deputy Station Head Jia also slammed loudly on the hand rest!The people from the jury paid no heed. They already had a result!Zhang Ye noticed the actions of the two Leaders. Up until this point, the station\u2019s Leaders still had the same attitude towards him. They did not even want to give him the little bit of respect he deserved. It was clear that they did not acknowledge Zhang Ye. He finally saw through it. So what if he worked hard? So what if he broke the Central Radio Station\u2019s record? So what if he got first in his channel\u2019s listenership ratings? So what if he won the Silver Microphone Award?The Station Head and Deputy Station Head Jia would never look kindly at a small figure like him! They had taken for granted Zhang Ye\u2019s great contribution from his results. Zhang Ye had used his works to create a legend, and even did not want any bit of compensation for his copyright from the station, yet they still thought it was expected of him, and in turn, tried to basically rob him of his copyright without spending a dime. And if he didn\u2019t give it to them? If he didn\u2019t give it to them, he would be threatened! Removed from his position! Not given a nomination! They were so ugly in their actions and faces that they looked inhumane!It was as if Zhang Ye owed them. They would never remember Zhang Ye for his merits. They would never care about his results. That was all that they cared about!It was quite tragic! Zhang Ye\u2019s heart was already completely cold. A surge of anger exploded in him. He had already accumulated this sentiment of his for too long. He could not repress it any further!\u201cMay I invite Teacher Zhang Ye to come onstage to receive his award.\u201d Zhang Huo smiled.Zhang Ye straightened his clothes and strode up, \u201cThank you.\u201dZhang Yuanqi was wearing a nightgown today. It was purple. A large portion of her smooth back was revealed. The whiteness was especially charming. She took over the trophy from a staff member, and with a gentle smile and eyes, no one could tell the Heavenly Queen\u2019s usual indifferent nature, \u201cTeacher Zhang, congratulations.\u201d\u201cThank you, Teacher Zhang.\u201d Zhang Ye took the trophy from the Heavenly Queen\u2019s hands.Receiving this award was not easy, but was this the end of it? No! It was not over!Zhang Huo conditioned the atmosphere, \u201cAs the saying goes, the road to happiness is strewn with setbacks. Teacher Zhang took the longest to receive this year\u2019s Silver Microphone Award. Hur Hur.\u201d Looking at the audience, he said, \u201cSome people might not know Teacher Zhang, or they might not be familiar with him. But if I say something, I\u2019m sure many would know. A few days ago at the Mid-Autumn Poetry Meet, it\u2019s this Teacher Zhang who beat all sorts of elites, shocking the entire auditorium with a single \u2018Shuidiao Getou\u2019!\u201d\u201cOh!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve heard of it!\u201d\u201cSo it was him?\u201dQuite a small number of people were enlightened!Zhang Huo acted according to tradition and began introducing Zhang Ye\u2019s segments. It was easy for others, as they would end with a few words, but Zhang Ye\u2019s was really very long. \u201cTeacher Zhang had previously hosted \u2018Late-night Ghost Stories\u2019 and \u2018Old and Young Story Club\u2019. He gave birth to several excellent works, such as \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019, \u2018Little Bunnies Be Good\u2019, \u2018Snow White and the Seven Dwarves\u2019, \u2018The Emperor\u2019s New Clothes\u2019 and \u2018The Wizard of Oz\u2019. And they were all original creations of Teacher Zhang!\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d\u201cHe was the one who wrote \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019?\u201d\u201cEven \u2018Little Bunnies Be Good\u2019 was created by him?\u201d\u201cHoly ****, I wouldn\u2019t know if you didn\u2019t say it, but the moment you said it, it\u2019s really frightening!\u201d\u201cWho is this person? He\u2019s so awesome!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s nothing. It is only now that you understand? Note that the most famous \u2018Flying Bird and Fish\u2019 was written by him. I heard this poem even saved a life.\u201d\u201cI know this person, too. I especially like \u2018The Song of the Stormy Petrel\u2019. It\u2019s so aggressive!\u201d\u201cWith these qualifications, he can even vie for the Golden Microphone Awards. Why was there so much controversy over a Silver Microphone Award? If he doesn\u2019t get it, who else can get it? Are the judges blind?\u201dSome people had heard of him, while there were even more people who heard of him for the first time.After hearing all this, many people were astonished by Zhang Ye\u2019s achievements!Zhang Huo carried on, \u201cI\u2019m not sure if Teacher Zhang has brought with him an acceptance speech. I recall that the Mid-Autumn Poetry Meet was also hosted by me, and the acceptance speech Teacher Zhang gave could only be described as art. It is as good as his talent for poetry.\u201d As they were colleagues, Zhang Huo also knew him, so he added on quite a bit more. This was also to ease his tension, since the he was at an important occasion, so even a senior like Zhang Huo could not feel at ease.Zhang Ye smirked, \u201cSince Teacher Zhang Huo has mentioned my poems, then I will use a poem for my acceptance speech.\u201dZhang Huo laughed out, \u201cThen that will be a treat to our ears, for us to hear your new work for the first time.\u201d After he finished, he stepped back and gave the stage to Zhang Ye.Zhang Yuanqi also went down. She sat in the first row, listening.Zhang Ye touched the microphone stand in front of him, \u201cI actually did not wish to say anything today. I want to use this occasion and setting to thank the station\u2019s management that helped me. Our Beijing Radio Station\u2019s Station Head, and our radio station\u2019s Deputy Station Head Jia. Without the strong support from my Leaders, there would not be today\u2019s Zhang Ye!\u201d\u2026Below.When Deputy Station Head Jia heard this, he thought, \u201cAt least you know how to appreciate favors!\u201dHowever, the Station Head did not even give Zhang Ye a look. From the beginning to the end, Zhang Ye had not entered his eyes!Jia Yan snorted in his heart. He looked down on Zhang Ye. To even say that you received help from the Station Head and Deputy Station Head? You sure know how to kiss ass! Now you know the importance of having a good relationship with the Leader? It\u2019s too late! For you to obtain an award you should not receive! It is considered an accident! The Leader will not let you go. He will definitely remember to take revenge on you! Zh\u0101ng Y\u011b was someone close to the Station Head! You even dared to steal his award? It\u2019s too late trying to suck up now!\u2026Big Sis Zhou said with a surprise, \u201cWhat\u2019s Little Zhang saying?\u201d\u201cThis doesn\u2019t sound like what Little Zhang would say.\u201d Auntie Sun was also wondering.Tian Bin interjected, \u201cHe\u2019s been forced by the situation. From a certain perspective, Little Zhang has matured.\u201dThe old editor sighed, \u201cIndeed. Hai, this is also a chance to reconcile relations. Little Zhang is still quite smart. He knows that this situation is not a time for private emotions.\u201d\u2026The famous Program Producer formerly from Central TV was also offstage. He had been transferred to the Beijing Television Station for work, so he was naturally invited for the Golden Microphone Awards.\u201cOld Hu, this is the newcomer that you recommended?\u201d\u201cYes. He is Zhang Ye, a very talented young man.\u201d\u201cHis looks are quite plain. You want him to be your segment\u2019s host or guest? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate.\u201d\u201cI seldom make a mistake in my judgment of people. This kind of talent is not met even in a hundred years. Isn\u2019t he going to recite a poem soon? Listen well. See if my evaluation is wrong.\u201dHu Fei began promoting Zhang Ye.\u2026\u201cSis Zhang, you know this Zhang Ye?\u201d a young judge in the first row spoke softly.Zhang Yuanqi gave a smile, \u201cI don\u2019t know him.\u201d\u201cThen why did you give the additional nomination to him?\u201d The youth was puzzled.Zhang Yuanqi said, \u201cI\u2019ve seen his \u2018See Me or Not\u2019 poem before. I think it\u2019s very good.\u201dThe young judge was enlightened, \u201cI see. This person\u2019s poems are indeed exceptional. I have not seen \u2018See Me or Not\u2019, but \u2018Shuidiao Getou\u2019 was like a precious jewel falling into my hands.\u201dAnother old judge said, \u201cLet\u2019s see what poem he will recite today. I happen to have heard of his \u2018A Generation\u2019. I heard that there were some problems with that bunch of people from the Beijing Writers\u2019 Association?\u201d\u2026Other than these industry insiders, other people were not looking forward to it.\u201cThank the Leaders?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s nice about such an acceptance speech?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right; to think he even wrote a poem to thank his Leaders? What an ass-kisser! He\u2019s kissing too much ass!\u201d\u201cWhat can you do? It\u2019s all people in the system. Who can you thank other than the Leaders?\u201dQuite a number of radio and television station counterparts from other provinces were dismissive. Some even silently scolded Zhang Ye as an ass-kisser!\u2026Everyone was discussing.However, Zhang Ye was not distracted. In this atmosphere that was not particularly quiet, on this stage with elites and Leaders gathered, Zhang Ye recited a poem. \u201cThis poem is me giving back to my station\u2019s Leaders, as well as Beijing Radio Station, which nurtured and taught me!\u201dEveryone listened most devoutly and respectfully.Zhang Ye closed his eyes to gather his emotions. The first lines of his poem dumbfounded everyone. His opening expression was that of a mocking laughter, \u201cThis is a bleak pool of dead water, where no breeze can raise a ripple. One may as well throw in metal scraps and leftover food!\u201dDead water?Furthermore, a bleak pool of dead water?What modern poem was this? Are you sure that this is thanking the Leaders and the unit?Many people began whispering. Some of them had not even gotten around to it!Zhang Ye carried on, and sneered, \u201cPerhaps the metal will turn into emeralds, the rusty cans into peach blossoms, the grease will weave a silken gauze, and the mold will rise and become twilight clouds. Let the dead water ferment into a green wine, in which white foam floats like pearls. Tiny pearls giggle and turn into big pearls, then get broken by pilfering mosquitoes. Perhaps a bleak pool of dead water is fair, after all. If the frogs get lonely, they can bring music to the place.\u201dUpon reaching this point, Zhang Ye\u2019s expression suddenly changed into a cold and angry look as his voice reached a crescendo, \u201cThis is a bleak pool of dead water! Where beauty cannot reside!\u201d Finally, he stressed, \u201cOne may as well let the Devil cultivate it! And see what kind of world he will create!!!\u201dEveryone was dumbfounded!Faced with the absolute silence and a shocked crowd, Zhang Ye dropped the microphone and left while holding his trophy after finishing his poem!This poem was called \u201cDead Water\u201d, and it was written by Wen Yiduo. It did not exist in this world.In Zhang Ye\u2019s world, this poem could be considered the most famous \u201cscolding poem\u201d and \u201ccursing poem\u201d. This was also the highlight of\u00a0Wen Yiduo\u2018s poem. There was only one central idea and theme from the beginning to the end, and that was to scold! And this poem was even printed in high school education textbooks! In his second year of high school, his teacher had specifically made them all memorize it to recite it. It was probably the same with many other schools, hence Zhang Ye did not need to use the \u201cMemory Search Capsule\u201d at all to clearly recite it ad verbatim. This poem was too famous, and he was too familiar with it!He had scolded happily!He got a kick from cursing!After being repressed for so long, Zhang Ye finally was in a great mood today. He was happy, inside and out!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He only left his back and the outcry of thousands of guests and judges!Holy ****!What modern poem was this!?Could you mean that your Beijing Radio Station is Dead Water? Your radio station\u2019s Leaders are devils? No, there was no need to begin the sentence with \u2018could\u2019, he clearly meant that! This sort of poem was not profound. \u201cDead Water\u201d was extremely easy to understand. That\u2019s right; it was used for scolding!\u201cWhat the f***!\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t this way too overbearing?\u201d\u201cIs this person mad? How can he say that?\u201d\u201cWasn\u2019t he going to thank the unit and his Leaders?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right; I even believed it. Haha, this will be interesting!\u201d\u201cAlthough it\u2019s not broadcast live, but this is still the Silver Microphone Awards; is he sure that he won\u2019t get into trouble for saying that? Can he really do that? Isn\u2019t this offending his Leader to the point of death? Station Head? Didn\u2019t he mention a Deputy Station Head Jia in his acceptance speech? He is already naming names. Aiyah, holy ****. I really did not come for nothing. I really did a good job vying for one of the ten tickets from my unit. When would you usually hear such a heroic modern poem? This poem is too classic. He cursed so ruthlessly!\u201d\u201cTo think that the television and radio station system has such a ruthless person!\u201d\u201cZhang Ye? I have remembered this name. Haha, impressive!\u201d\u201cI have to apologize. I even scolded Zhang Ye for being an ass-kisser, I never expected that it was such a \u2018thank you\u2019!\u201dThis was the perspective of the audience . As they had no direct interest in the matter, everyone just had the state of mind of watching a thrilling show.But there were some people who were not the same.Big Sis Zhou nearly dropped her jaws upon hearing it. She smacked herself in the forehead, saying loudly, \u201cI already said it! I already said it! Thank the Leaders and the unit, my ass! This is not something Little Zhang would say! When has he ever fawned upon the powerful!? You see! I hit the jackpot!\u201dZhao Guozhou, \u201c\u2026\u201d He already did not know how to speak.Tian Bin and his wife were also in a daze. Back when Zhang Ye was about to give his thank you speech, they had thought that he was trying to make a compromise with the Leader, and had known how to yield and exercise forbearance. But the next moment, with Zhang Ye reciting such a poem, they could not figure out where Zhang Ye got the courage!Xiaofang stamped her feet due to her worry, \u201cWhat do we do now!? Teacher Zhang has caused such big trouble!\u201d\u201cOnly big trouble?\u201d Wang Xiaomei said, \u201cLittle Zhang has offended too many people this time!\u201dAuntie Sun whispered, \u201cBut the way he scolded sure was good for venting anger! I have never understood Little Zhang\u2019s other poems, that \u2018Flying bird and fish\u2019, or \u2018The Song of the Stormy Petrel\u2019. I do not have much cultural literacy. But today\u2019s \u201cDead Water\u201d, I really understood it. It\u2019s written so well and delightfully. May as well throw in metal scraps? And leftover food? Little Zhang is certainly completely disappointed with the station. This place is like a pool of Dead Water to him!\u201dThe old editor was at a loss about whether to laugh or to cry, \u201cYou can\u2019t say that, either. What sort of occasion is this? It\u2019s the Golden Microphone Awards! There are the top predecessor Teachers in the industry. There\u2019s the Heavenly Queen, the other television and radio station\u2019s staff, and many audience members not from this circle. Little Zhang may get a kick from scolding, but what will happen later? Does he still want to work in the station? They went ahead with the blunder of the award, and that was not already not a small problem.An additional nominee winning the award? This was another unprecedented event! Alright, then he used a microphone to scold the unit and the Leaders during his acceptance speech? This is no longer an unprecedented event. Do you understand? It\u2019s not something that will happen in the future, either! There will only be this once!\u201dYes, this matter was absolutely unprecedented and would never occur ever again. The old editor dared to guarantee it, because if it was another person, no one would dare to do this!Xiaofang gave a wry smile, \u201cTeacher Zhang has always had such a temper.\u201dBig Sis Zhou said, \u201cThat\u2019s right. Only Little Zhang would dare to do it. Sometimes, I really envy him, and I like this guy more and more. He\u2019s blunt. If he\u2019s not happy, he scolds. You can feel peace of mind when you interact with him. You never need to worry about him scheming against you. Everything is placed out in the light with Little Zhang; he would never backstab someone.\u201dThe old editor said in a speechless manner, \u201cYou may be feeling good, but others aren\u2019t.\u201d\u2026Hu Fei was one of those who were not feeling good. After hearing Zhang Ye\u2019s poem, Hu Fei nearly fainted. Just a few minutes ago, he was boasting on behalf of Zhang Ye to his channel\u2019s Director, who was beside him. He had strongly recommended that Zhang Ye join his new segment. Who knew that a few minutes later, Zhang Ye had done this!The Director glanced at him, \u201cTeacher Hu, this is the person you are recommending?\u201dHu Fei gave a cough and helped speak up for Zhang Ye, \u201cLet\u2019s put aside his temper for now. Just looking at this poem, there are absolutely no flaws. It is pure literature.\u201dThe Director also could not control his laughter, \u201cYou sure can right a wrong for him. I don\u2019t know if it is pure literature; I only know he is prickly!\u201dHu Fei said, \u201cTalented people tend to have an attitude.\u201dThe Director said, \u201cBut his attitude is too explosive. Thankfully the Silver Microphone Award is a lifelong award. There is no revoking it; if not, just that modern poem in his acceptance speech could have gotten his award revoked. Besides, the Beijing Radio Station is also under the same umbrella as our Beijing Television Station. We have merged long ago. By scolding their radio station, isn\u2019t that also including us?Old Hu, I need to give your recommendation further thought. I dare to guarantee you that after this matter, Zhang Ye might very likely be known by everyone in the television and radio station business. Some people may appreciate him for his bold words, but even more will push him aside. No one in the industry will dare hire him. You can nearly call it a ban. Hur Hur. Who would dare want a ticking time bomb? If he did that at a critical moment, who could stand him!?\u201dHu Fei firmly said, \u201cEven if he is prickly, I still want him. His literary talent definitely cannot be buried, for it will be too great a pity!\u201d\u2026Over at the judges.Zhang Yuanqi watched Zhang Ye leave the place with smiling eyes. She did not comment.The young judge was speechless, and after that said, \u201cThis poem.. sure is alright\u2026\u201d After he hesitated for a while, he did not dare say anything further, as he knew Zhang Ye was recommended by Zhang Yuanqi. Although he did not believe that Zhang Ye could know the Heavenly Queen, in the end, it was still Zhang Yuanqi who gave the nomination. He had to give the Heavenly Queen face, for he was not like Teacher Zheng and the other judges. He did not have the experience, nor the age. He did not dare to be rash in front of Zhang Yuanqi, for she was his predecessor.Teacher Zheng closed his eyes and did not make a sound.\u201cOld Zheng? What do we do?\u201d A female judge consulted, \u201cIs he not respecting our award presentation stage and jury?\u201dTeacher Zheng opened his eyes, \u201cLet\u2019s put aside whether the poem is right for the occasion; just this \u201cDead Water\u201d has broadened my horizons. Originally, I did not intend to join the jury this year. I\u2019m already old and should step back. But now I feel that I\u2019m very thankful to have come here. Hur Hur. Do you believe it? Just with this modern poem, I dare to say that this young man will definitely carve a name for himself! One may as well let the Devil cultivate it! And see what kind of world he will create? I\u2019m very interested to see how this young man will create such a world!\u201d\u2026At this moment, the most angry people were the radio station\u2019s Leaders!There was no need to mention the unit\u2019s Station Head. He had already promised his old comrade\u2019s child this year\u2019s Silver Microphone Award, but ended up failing. This already made him extremely angry. Now, Zhang Ye came along with a finishing move.It was not smacking of face, neither was it trampling of face, it was live stomping of face! One foot after the other, stomping on their faces! With so many peers and predecessors present, there were also the Leaders from other broadcasting entities. The Beijing Television Station\u2019s Leader was here, too.The Station Head already felt he has lost all his face, with nothing left of it! From today onwards, no, there\u2019s was no need for tomorrow. Just this afternoon, this matter would probably spread to all the television and radio stations. How was he to look up ever again? To be scolded by a subordinate who was a lowest-level newcomer anchor, and yet have no way of retorting. Zhang Ye was holding a microphone onstage. Even if the Station Head had said something, no one else could hear him.But the Station Head was still good. He was in relatively better shape.What was most notable was Deputy Station Head Jia. Zhang Ye was in the Literature Channel under him. As he had conflict with Zhang Ye over the copyright matter, it was Deputy Station Head Jia who made the decision to make it difficult for him. Hence, Zhang Ye\u2019s retaliation this time was clearly meant for him!\u201cThis f***ing punk!\u201d Deputy Station Head Jia\u2019s face was already green. It was really green. He could not stop himself from cursing. He had turned silly from anger due to Zhang Ye. His lungs were almost exploding, in the end, maybe because his heart could not take the anger, Deputy Station Head Jia ended up suffering from shortness of breath. His eyes turned white and he actually passed out!Another Deputy Station Head beside him was fast. Seeing Deputy Station Head Jia\u2019s neck slump on his seat, he quickly held him, \u201cOld Jia! Old Jia!\u201d\u201cAiyah!\u201cDeputy Station Head Jia!\u201d\u201cSomeone come quickly! Someone come quickly!\u201d\u201cCall an ambulance! Someone fainted!\u201d\u201cFirst check his pulse. Quickly, see if he\u2019s still breathing!\u201dIt became a huge mess immediately. Seven to eight people gathered around to help!In the end, there was not big a problem. After rubbing his philtrum, Deputy Station Head Jia woke up. A staff from backstage helped him measure his blood pressure, and indeed he was fine.This tiny episode made people even more speechless.Deputy Station Head Jia also felt the shame of letting a subordinate he looked down upon anger him to the point of fainting. His face naturally looked ugly!Zhang!Wait and see!The Station Head used this matter to talk to the five judges, \u201cTeachers, I suggest withdrawing the Silver Microphone Award from Zhang Ye. This person spoke nonsense and discredited his organization unit. He has to be severely punished!\u201dThe most qualified old judge, Old Zheng, looked at him, before discussing simply with the other judges. He said, \u201cI\u2019m afraid that\u2019s impossible. The award has been handed out. Be it the Golden Microphone Award or the Silver Microphone Award, they are lifetime awards. There is no process or rule for withdrawing the award.\u201d After he finished speaking, he added on, \u201cThis little comrade\u2019s speech indeed is a bit problematic. Your unit should handle the education and disciplinary matters itself.\u201d\u201cBut the Silver Microphone Award\u2026\u201d Deputy Station Head Jia stood up due to his flustered anger.Another young judge flatly said, \u201cThe award will not be revoked. The rules are rules. Well, let\u2019s begin the next award presentation. Hurry up and do not delay the Golden Microphone Awards\u2019 live broadcast. We don\u2019t have much time left!\u201dThe other Silver Microphone Awards were announced, but no one had the mind to pay attention to them. No one even cared about the Golden Microphone Awards!Zhang Ye had stolen all the limelight by himself!Zhang Ye had attracted all the attention with a single \u201cDead Water\u201d!A few sensitive reporters even ignored the awardees\u2019 name from then on, not caring whose Silver Microphone Award it was. They just sat at their seats and began typing up a manuscript, preparing to immediately report back to their office about this matter. Teacher Zhang Ye, well done! The reporters were thrilled. Their professional traits were fated to be those of people who wished to see the world burn. They were not afraid how big a controversy you would make; they were afraid that you would not make a big enough controversy!What was a topic of controversy?This was a topic of controversy!What could be more interesting and eye-catching than a person scolding his Leaders during an acceptance speech?Besides, this was not any normal scolding. It did not use vulgarities without any technical skill!Cursing tends to be a derogatory term. When mentioned, the first impression others have is its lack of quality. But today, Zhang Ye had broadened the horizons of everyone. One could scold others in such a bold and unrestrained manner. Scolding others could be so elegant and cultured. This was the first time they had really seen it. They had learned something!This was a scholar!Killing people without knives, using one\u2019s mouth!Swearing without one\u2019s mouth, using one\u2019s poems!Zhang Ye had used \u201cDead Water\u201d today to show the lofty sentiments of a scholar. He had inherited the good tradition of a poet, quaking the world with his poems!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There was still some commotion, but Zhang Ye had already left the venue and backstage. Along the way, Zhang Ye attracted the attention of many people. This was because outside the theatre, the staff had also heard Zhang Ye\u2019s poem. Some of them even saw him while they were below the stage. Therefore, there was such a strange scene happening now.\u201cUh.\u201d\u201cHey, look!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s Zhang Ye.\u201d\u201cF***, this guy is too awesome!\u201dA few staff members kept staring at him like he was some kind of god.Some others who were not aware of the situation could see the crowd watching Zhang Ye and parting when Zhang Ye passed through them and thought that he was some superstar. That can\u2019t be necessary, right? He\u2019s just walking along. Why does everyone need to send him off so properly?\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you know? You weren\u2019t at the venue earlier?\u201d\u201cNo. I took over my shift outside earlier.\u201d\u201cHey, then you\u2019ve missed a great show. go regret it in a corner. Haha!\u201dSeeing everyone\u2019s reactions, Zhang Ye knew that he had done something with big repercussions today. It was not like he did not know his cursing poem was inappropriate. He had killed his chances at remaining in the radio broadcasting industry. The same could be said of the TV industry, especially in Beijing Television Station, which is a sister station to Beijing Radio Station. With the cursing speech by Zhang Ye, they would not have a good impression of him. Even though Hu Fei had promised him that if he had won the Silver Microphone Award, he could join his new program, after the poem the invite would have been voided. Zhang Ye had weighed his thoughts and was clear that he would not be joining Beijing Television Station anymore.But even so, he just wanted to curse!He would do it all over again if given the chance!You are the people I\u2019m cursing! Your faces are the ones I\u2019m slapping! I just want to put you in a spot! I just want to expose your ugly faces to those in the industry! And any other thing? Zhang Ye did not care about any other things; he just wanted to feel good first. To let those who made him uncomfortable, he would not let them be comfortable, either!That\u2019s how it was!It was that simple!At this moment, Zhang Ye\u2019s phone rang. So many people were calling him: his Leader, his colleagues and some others whom he did not know. They might have been reporters. Zhang Ye rejected them all without exception. He did not want to listen to anyone right now. What was done was done, andwhat was scolded had been scolded; there was no need for an explanation.He only strolled slowly into a restaurant and treated himself to a meal. There was a television in the restaurant and it was tuned into Beijing Television Station. The Golden Microphone Awards event was just about to start. Zhang Ye only footed the bill after the awards ceremony finished its broadcast. He took a bus back to the Beijing Radio Station afterwards.\u2026Afternoon.The colleagues who were in the Grand Theater had all made their way back. They were discussing the happenings of the day with those who did not attend the awards. They only had half a day off and had work in the afternoon.\u201cAh?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not true, right?\u201d\u201cBig Sis Zhou, you are just joking around, right?\u201d\u201cYeah, how can that be? Does Teacher Little Zhang still want his job?\u201dJust as they spoke of the devil, Zhang Ye returned at this moment. When he stepped into the office, everyone\u2019s gazes were focused on him!Big Sis Zhou exclaimed loudly, \u201cLittle Zhang! Why didn\u2019t you answer the phone!\u201dZhang Ye smiled \u201cI didn\u2019t hear it; I was having lunch earlier.\u201d\u201cYou were great!\u201d Big Sis Zhou said. \u201cDid you know that after you left, the whole theater\u2019s atmosphere was so charged up! You winning the Silver Microphone Award this time, it could be said that you have entered the record books. First was the blunder, then came \u2018Dead Water\u2019. You were nothing short of astonishing!\u201dAuntie Sun said, \u201cDeputy Station Head Jia was so angry that he fainted.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Zhang Ye blinked, \u201cReally?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201d Xiaofang quickly mentioned, \u201cHis neck was crooked on his seat. Everyone was in a mess and they had to resuscitate him!\u201d\u201cHow is he now?\u201d Zhang Ye asked.\u201cHe\u2019s alright. They pinched his philtrum and he recovered. I guess it was the shock.\u201d Big Sis Zhou answered.Soon after, perhaps the news of Zhang Ye\u2019s return had spread. Zhao Guozhou arrived with big strides. \u201cLittle Zhang, get over here. Look at the big mess you created!\u201d he chided. He said with a straight face, \u201cFollow me. The station leaders are calling for you; explain it to them yourself!\u201dZhang Ye reached into his pocket, took out a letter and placed it on the desk, \u201cLeader, this is my resignation letter. I will not be explaining it to them, nor could I. I will not be working for them anymore. Please let them find someone else that is better!\u201d Having said that, Zhang Ye started to pack his desk. A long-serving employee would find this troublesome, but Zhang Ye was strictly still in a probationary period. His resignation process was too simple.Zhao Guozhou\u2019s face blackened, \u201cYou are leaving, just like that?\u201d\u201cLeader, honestly, I would like to not go.\u201d Zhang Ye said so sincerely to Deputy Zhao and also at every one of his colleagues. He said, \u201cHere, I learned a lot. My present results cannot be removed from the help of you, Director Zhao and colleagues Xiaofang, Teacher Xiaomei, Big Sis Zhou, Auntie Sun, Teacher Feng, etc. Although I came for just over a month, I have also grown attached to everyone. Who would want to leave unless it was a last resort? But the reality is as such. Everyone has already seen it. It\u2019s not that I want to leave, but it\u2019s the station forcing me to leave. As the saying goes, \u2018while the dropping flowers pine for love, the heartless brook babbles on unrequited love\u2019. I would not stay here, asking to be snuffed out!\u201dZhao Guozhou exasperatedly said, \u201cYou are too rash!\u201d\u201cI am not rash, Director. I have thought through it clearly and understand it very well.\u201d Zhang Ye turned to look at his colleagues and gave a deep bow, \u201cThank you for everyone\u2019s help all this while!\u201dXiaofang\u2019s eyes turned red, \u201cTeacher Zhang.\u201dBig Sis Zhou and Auntie Sun also could not bear to part, \u201cWe really don\u2019t want you to go.\u201dHowever, everyone was not surprised with Zhang Ye\u2019s resignation. The station\u2019s Leader had been too unfair with Zhang Ye and had gone too far. If it was anyone else, they would also go mad!Zhang Ye smiled, \u201cIt\u2019s alright. We can meet again when we have the chance.\u201dZhao Guozhou sighed, knowing that Zhang Ye had made up his mind, \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll do the paperwork for you.\u201d He brought Zhang Ye to his office. When there were only the two of them, Zhao Guozhou said, \u201cYou were brought in by me into this business, and I have always appreciated you. Now with things in such a situation, I am also quite at fault. Little Zhang. Hai, I didn\u2019t manage to protect you, letting you feel wronged.\u201dZhang Ye hurriedly said, \u201cDon\u2019t say that. You are my Bole. I will never forget this kindness for life. I know you did your best. You can\u2019t do anything with the Station Leader\u2019s instructions. Anyways, if there\u2019s anything in the future, just tell me. If I have the ability, I will never refuse!\u201dZhao Guozhou suggested, \u201cLet\u2019s have a last meal tonight with everyone.\u201dZhang Ye waved his hand, \u201cI think it\u2019s best not to. My status now is sensitive. I have already offended the Station Leaders to such an extent. If they know that everyone sent me off, it will give trouble to everyone. It\u2019s fine going off on my own.\u201d He was very thoughtful, coming nicely, leaving simply.\u2026Afternoon.The resignation paperwork was done.Zhang Ye hugged his stuff as he left the unit. Coincidentally, he met Jia Yan and Zh\u0101ng Y\u011b, who had just come back.Enemies see red the moment they meet!Jia Yan might have already gotten the news, \u201cYo, leaving?\u201d\u201cZhang Ye.\u201d Zh\u0101ng Y\u011b stared at him, \u201cI will remember today\u2019s matters, and it will be for life. If we have the opportunity to meet again at work, we will square off!\u201dZhang Ye smiled, \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll wait for that day.\u201dJia Yan said, \u201cYou won\u2019t meet him. You think anyone in the industry will dare to want a person who dares to publicly denounce his unit\u2019s Leader?\u201dZhang Ye said, \u201cJust wait and see, then.\u201dAfter taking one last look at the building, the place where he had worked his first job after graduation, Zhang Ye\u2019s gave a complicated gaze. After he chuckled, he turned around and strode away, without looking back! Now, there was no use in saying anything else, so he did not leave behind any words. However, in his heart, Zhang Ye said to himself, \u201cBeijing Radio Station, I will use concrete actions to prove to you that forcing me away is your loss! I will definitely let you regret every action you made whenever you hear my name, Zhang Ye!\u201dJia Yan and Zh\u0101ng Y\u011b entered the station\u2019s door. Zhang Ye was gone, but they did not feel happy at all. Why? Because Zhang Ye did not suffer at all. Not only did he get glory and results from the radio station, he had thickened his resume and won the Silver Microphone Award. Leaving with the Silver Microphone Award trophy in his hand, he had gotten everything he could as a newcomer. On the other hand, the station had suffered due to Zhang Ye. They had entered a passive condition with his \u201cDead Water\u201d scoldings. It could be imagined that the radio station would not be peaceful in the future. They had to busy themselves to reduce any influence from this terrible situation to its minimum! This fellow Zhang Ye had left, but he had left behind a mess!Who profited?The result was obvious!Going for wool and coming home shorn! It was like the Dog and its Reflection!The Station Head and Deputy Station Head Jia really felt the pain from Zhang Ye\u2019s beating! Maybe they had never imagined that this world had a newcomer that did not spare his punches like Zhang Ye!What scholar? Bull****!This was a damn hooligan!Everyone had already seen the essence of Zhang Ye. After \u201cDead Water\u201d, Zhang Ye\u2019s name had become famous in the industry. But of course, it was notoriety! The newspaper, gossip tabloids and online videos were most likely beginning to report on Zhang Ye\u2019s \u2018acceptance speech\u2019 at the Silver Microphone Awards. From today onwards, Zhang Ye\u2019s name would be synonymous with notoriety in the radio industry!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But even if it was not a weekend, Zhang Ye had to take a \u201clong vacation\u201d. After leaving the radio station, he was now a free man.The phone rang.Zhang Ye did not pick it up the first time, as he was sleeping soundly.However, the phone kept ringing nonstop, giving Zhang Ye a headache.He could only yawn as he grabbed the cellphone on the table, \u201cHello. Who\u2019s this?\u201d\u201cWho do you think is it?\u201d It was Mom\u2019s voice, \u201cWhy are you still sleeping? It\u2019s already 9+! And I want to ask you, what is this matter that is written in the newspapers? How did a rotten kid like you offend his Leader again? If you took the Silver Microphone Award, so be it! It\u2019s such a good thing! Even a person who doesn\u2019t know your industry like me knows about the award! It\u2019s very valuable! But what did you say for your acceptance speech!? Do you still want to work at your unit?\u201dZhang Ye said sleepily, \u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Mom turned worried.\u201cI already resigned yesterday. My wages have also been settled.\u201d Zhang Ye told his Mom.Mom was angry from worry, \u201cYou finally managed to find a job and you were doing well! Why did you quit!? Are you dumb!? That is the Beijing Radio Station! An institution! Where can you find a better place than that in the future? Who would want you with your looks?\u201dZhang Ye gave a helpless laughter, \u201cMom, I\u2019ve already resigned. I will have no future staying there. Let me rest a few days. After that, I\u2019ll go look for other units.\u201dMom was rejected, \u201cNo, immediately take back your resignation letter!\u201d\u201cMom\u2026\u201d Zhang Ye was at a loss of whether to laugh or to cry, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. My next unit will definitely be better than this. And it has to be much better. I assure you.\u201d\u201cNo way!\u201d Mom was angry.However, Dad\u2019s voice came from over the phone. Zhang Ye only heard him say lightly, \u201cOur son has grown up. He has his own plans, so you don\u2019t have to worry about it.\u201d\u201cHow can I not be worried!? Now all our relatives know my son is a small celebrity in the radio station. With him quitting, how can I keep bragging in the future?\u201d Mom was quite frank.Zhang Ye was amused, \u201cAlright, Mom. Let\u2019s end it here. I\u2019m hanging up.\u201dAfter putting down the cellphone, he could no longer fall back asleep. He got up and used the computer and watched the news.Indeed, there were many forum discussions on the Silver Microphone Awards ceremony yesterday online. Zhang Ye\u2019s Weibo had been @ crazily, with a barrage of notification sounds!\u201cI love this \u2018Dead Water\u2019 too much!\u201d\u201cEvery work of Teacher Zhang Ye is earth-shaking!\u201d\u201cHaha. It is a delight to hear and see! Teacher Zhang Ye also can get mad! So addicting!\u201d\u201cWell-cursed! The institutional abuse is too much nowadays! Only Teacher Zhang Ye dares to stand up and speak out!\u201d\u201cDid you notice that Teacher Zhang\u2019s Weibo\u2019s verification has changed to \u2018Former Beijing Radio Station Literature Channel famous radio host\u2019. Was Teacher Zhang fired?\u201d\u201cHe wasn\u2019t fired. I heard my insider friends say that he had resigned by himself.\u201d\u201cSo what if he quits. There\u2019s no need to be attached to such a Dead Water unit. Teacher Zhang, you still have us. No matter where you go, we will support you!\u201d\u201cWell-said! Supporting Zhang Ye!\u201d\u201cAll limbs up in the air while rolling on the floor to support!\u201d\u201cA single \u2018Dead Water\u2019 has sounded the words in people\u2019s hearts. Yes, it is clearly Dead Water filled with metal scraps and leftover food, yet it pretends to be elegant. This is the state of many of our units. It reeks of death, with the Devil proliferating it. On Monday, when I was at work, I really wanted to be like Teacher Zhang Ye, shouting at my unit\u2019s Leader, \u2018One may as well let the Devil cultivate it, and see what kind of world he will create\u2019, but I couldn\u2019t do it. I still have a family to feed. I do not dare to lose my job. I do not have Teacher Zhang Ye\u2019s boldness and courage, so after listening to that poem, I have made a decision. From today onwards, I will be a hard-core fan of Teacher Zhang Ye and will never change until death!\u201d\u201cWill never change until death+1!\u201d\u201cWill never change until death+28!\u201dThis work of Zhang Ye had brought him quite a number of white-collar worker fans online!\u201cDead Water\u201d had gone completely viral online. Not only was the poem well-written, the special background gave it additional fame. That was the Silver Microphone Awards ceremony. This made \u201cDead Water\u201d even more legendary, as people enjoyed talking about it!Weibo forwards!Forum clicks!The publication in newspapers!The transmission of the award ceremony\u2019s broadcast!Zhang Ye\u2019s popularity had once again increased slightly. Maybe it did not have much influence on people outside the circle, but it was shocking inside. Many people in the industry already knew of Zhang Ye\u2019s name!The comments and replies seen previously were mostly yesterday\u2019s.Suddenly, the fan, \u201cZhangYeNumber1Fan\u201d, who spared no effort in supporting Zhang Ye, @-ed him. A new Weibo post was published with a picture.\u201cWow, quick look at the Celebrity Rankings!\u201d\u201cGodly Number1, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t I attach a picture? Can\u2019t you see it?\u201d\u201cAh, I see it! Holy ****! Teacher Zhang Ye has become an E-list celebrity!\u201d\u201cIs that true? It\u2019s really true! Congratulations, Teacher Zhang Ye. You deserve it!\u201d\u201cCitizens of the Hebei province send their congratulations. Congratulating Teacher Zhang on making a new high!\u201d\u201cThere aren\u2019t many people who become E-list celebrities just from writing poems and making radio programs, right? You can count them with your fingers; there\u2019s definitely not more than 20 people!\u201d\u201cAwesome!\u201d\u201cTeacher Zhang is impressive!\u201dThey were all very lively and excited.However, when Zhang Ye saw this, he was confused. E-list celebrity? Celebrity Rankings? What and what? Zhang Ye knew he was still unfamiliar with this world. For example, his previous world did not have the Silver Microphone Awards. Hence with an open mind, he clicked the link everyone gave into the Celebrity Rankings\u2019 official website. Upon seeing it, he was shocked. Holy ****. He had originally thought that it was someone\u2019s personal website or some forum, but when he saw the organizing unit of the website, he was dumbfounded. It was the News, Publication &amp; Broadcast Bureau!This was an official authoritative website?There were even official announcements for Celebrity Rankings?He had initially thought it was fake. He quickly checked the website\u2019s cooperating units. There was the National Writers\u2019 Association, Directors\u2019 Union, Editors\u2019 Association, China Film Group Corporation, etc. Zhang Ye knew it was not fake. After a series of searches and inquiries, Zhang Ye finally manage to understand what this Celebrity Rankings was all about. This ranking was standardized internationally, and was not only effective domestically. It had a certain amount of authority even internationally. As for the ranking criteria and choices, they were partially done manually, but a large portion of it was calculated through a statistical formula. It was valid worldwide. The entire world also used this formula to give a celebrity a ranking based on his overall abilities, influence and popularity. It was most authoritative, unlike any other!In Zhang Ye\u2019s world, there were also rankings for celebrities.For example an international B-list celebrity, or a domestic S-list celebrity.But over there, this ranking had no fixed formula, nor was it conclusive. It was beauty in the eyes of the beholder. It only counted if a large number of people acknowledged it. It was comparatively fuzzy. For example, some celebrity may be considered as an A-list celebrity by industry insiders, but many people would only think he was a B-list celebrity. There were also cases where people felt he was a B-list celebrity, but the professionals or other people would think that he was a C-list celebrity. Who do you listen to? What rank would this celebrity be? There was no certainty, because there were no clear boundaries!But this world was different!There were all sorts of scores and all sorts of rules. Over many years of refinement, a nearly-perfect set of judging rules were produced. It was acknowledged by official bodies and the people. Even other celebrities acknowledged it! It was no longer that troublesome to know a celebrity\u2019s specs; one could get it from flipping through the Celebrity Rankings!Domestically, there were seven rankings.S-list, A-list, B-list, C-list, D-list, E-list.The seventh rank was not called a F-list celebrity. In this world, they were collectively referred to as \u201cpublic figures\u201d.After checking this out for a long time and taking a long time to absorb this information, Zhang Ye finally understood. The celebrity rankings between the two worlds were similar, but they also had their differences. For example, in Zhang Ye\u2019s world, when an E-list celebrity was mentioned, it was just an adjective. There was no real E-list celebrity in his world. The meaning of E-list meant the lowest and most obscure celebrity. There were at most the A-list, B-list, C-list and D-list. Even D-list was not something many people acknowledged. There was a lot of controversy behind it. However, over in this world, it was clearly demarcated. An A-list was an A-list, an E-list was an E-list. There was no dispute!There was another difference.Maybe it was because this world\u2019s entertainment industry was relatively more developed, where people crossed over more often. the rating score was an overall integrative score.Notability was important.Influence was important.The fan cohesiveness strength was important.The quality of the works were important.Good works had to be produced over a long period of time, and had to not go out of fashion.In general, no matter what industry one was in, the ranking depended on one\u2019s overall ability!For example, the authors,\u00a0Han Han\u00a0or\u00a0Guo Jingming, were they considered celebrities in Zhang Ye\u2019s world? Of course! Were they highly notable? Of course! But what rank were they? Probably no one could tell. There was no celebrity ranking system for people in the publication industry. At most, when they were mentioned, they would be publicly acknowledged as A-list authors in the publication industry, but this world had unified it. Be it writing novels, children\u2019s fairy tales, poems, or even university professors and wealthy businessmen who received a lot of attention, they could obtain a rating from their combined abilities and appeal using the statistical formula. Once the rating was calculated, they could be perfectly ranked!This was this world\u2019s Celebrity Rankings!Zhang Ye had used \u201cDead Water\u201d to go from a public figure to an E-list celebrity. This could be said to be one big step, and could also be said that this was the actual moment that he entered the entertainment industry. One had to know that be it Little Red Mushroom, the Vice President of the Beijing Writers\u2019 Association, or Big Thunder and company, they were all considered public figures. As for Tian Bin and Zh\u0101ng Y\u011b, they were ranked in the tens of thousands amongst public figures. They would not even be ranked.Zhang Ye had already surpassed them!Although an E-list celebrity was the lowest, it was still a celebrity!However, he still had a long way to go. This was just the beginning!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 82": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I\u2019m Really a SuperstarCH 81Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 81: The Absolute Unsparing Duo!Afternoon.The sun had risen. It was a bit stuffy in the house.Zhang Ye opened the room\u2019s door to air the place out. He stepped on a flyer that was slotted under the door and picked it up. He took a look and saw that it was a menu from a fast food restaurant called Long Long. It\u2019s likely this was a new eatery that only existed in this world, as Zhang Ye had never heard of it before. Whatever. Since it was convenient, he called in to make an order.\u201cHello.\u201d\u201cThis is Long Long Fast Food.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the cheapest item you have for delivery?\u201d\u201cWell, the cheapest is chicken rice. Adding the delivery fee, it comes to 15 Yuan.\u201d\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll take that. Let me give you the address.\u201dJust as he was about to hang up, Zhang Ye suddenly caught sight of a small shadow creeping into his house. Zhang Ye was startled, hung up the phone and then looked over. It was a little girl who came in. She was about eight years old and obviously an elementary student, as she was wearing a school uniform from the Xuanwu district\u2019s No.2 Experimental Primary School. The little girl had a face like a porcelain doll. Zhang Ye had never seen such a fair and glowing child; she was especially beautiful.\u201cLittle kid.\u201d Zhang Ye blinked, \u201cWho are you looking for?\u201dThe little girl took a glance at him, ignored his presence and walked straight to the fridge. She opened it up and looked inside, then as if it were her house, tiptoed at the edge on the inside of the fridge and reached for a bottle of cola that Zhang Ye had inside. She slammed the fridge door shut afterwards and looked around for a place to sit down. She found herself a seat on the sofa and twisted the bottle cap open and slowly enjoyed the gassy goodness.Zhang Ye, sweating with anxiety, asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name? And what are you doing here at my house? Did you lose your way from your parents? What are your parents\u2019 names? I\u2019ll take you back.\u201dThe little girl asked childishly, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m called Zhang Ye. Hey, why are you asking me instead?\u201d asked Zhang Ye.The little girl briefly acknowledge that and took a look at Zhang Ye for the first time, \u201cYou are THAT Zhang Ye? The school has been broadcasting your fairy tale every week now. I\u2019m so sick of it; it\u2019s so childish!\u201dZhang Ye asked, \u201cYou know me? My story is childish?\u201dThe little girl\u2019s tone was that of a child, but somehow her voice was deep. When she spoke, it felt like you owed her some money, \u201cNot childish? Just take \u2018Little Bunnies Be Good\u2019. When I first listened to it, I thought that the person who wrote it was rather dumb, like he had no general knowledge.\u201d She spoke with a logical flow and was composed, unlike many other kids her age. \u201cLet me ask you: is the Big Bad Wolf a picky eater?\u201dZhang Ye in confusion replied, \u201cWhy would a wolf be picky about food?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d she pouted. \u201cYou\u2019ve personified the wolf in your writing, making it able to open or knock on doors. The little bunnies could converse with the wolf, too. These are not the problems, though. However, you wrote that the wolf tried all kinds of means to lure the Little Bunnies out to eat them instead of eating the Mother Bunny, so this would be a fault in your logic. You just said that the Big Bad Wolf is not a picky eater, so why does it only want to eat the Little Bunnies and not the Mother Bunny? The Mother Bunny was not protected by the door. Would that mean that the wolf was repulsed by the thought of Mother Bunny\u2019s meat being too old? That it would be difficult to chew?\u201dZhang Ye \u201c\u2026\u201dThe little girl was calmly sipping on her cola and continued, \u201cAnother fundamental mistake is in the last paragraph where Mother Bunny used a stick to hit the wolf. Even if it had used a kitchen knife, it could not have beaten the wolf. Firstly, there\u2019s the physical difference in their build, and secondly, there\u2019s a gender difference, too, so how could it have beaten and chased off?\u201dZhang Ye \u201c\u2026..It\u2019s just a fairy tale; it precedes life!\u201dThe little girl\u2019s snorted, \u201cBut fairy tales are inspired by life.\u201dZhang Ye was rendered speechless. He nearly wanted to curse. Your sister! Which family did this unlucky child come from! Was the Big Bad Wolf a picky eater? A female bunny could not beat a male wolf? All these were questions that Zhang Ye had no answers to. He had been choked by them! Why are kids nowadays such smarty-pants? They are too unlikeable!\u201cBy the way, how do you know me?\u201d Zhang Ye looked at her and asked, \u201cDid your family tell you?\u201d That couldn\u2019t be right; he did not know most of the tenants here, nor had he even seen this kid before.Suddenly, the landlady auntie\u2019s voice could be heard coming from the corridor!\u201cChenchen!\u201d\u201cRao Chenchen!\u201d\u201cWhere did you run off to?\u201dAfter several shouts, under the stunned eyes of Zhang Ye, Chenchen shouted back to the outside, \u201cAunt, I am at Zhang Ye\u2019s house.\u201dTwo seconds later, Rao Aimin appeared in front of Zhang Ye\u2019s door. She came in and immediately stared at the little kid, \u201cRunning around again! Sooner or later, you will be sold off if you bump into human traffickers!\u201dRao Chenchen\u2019s sipped a little of her cola in disagreement.\u201cDrinking cola again? Who gave that to you?\u201d Rao Aimin angrily snatched the cola out of her hands, \u201cLet\u2019s go back to Aunty\u2019s house.\u201dRao Chenchen pursed her lips and said \u201cYou are always scolding me at home. I don\u2019t want to go back; it\u2019s better here at Zhang Ye\u2019s house.\u201dRao Aimin smacked her little head saying, \u201cCall him Uncle Zhang Ye; don\u2019t be disrespectful!\u201dZhang Ye was all confused while listening beside them. Damn it, I was still wondering why the speaking manner of the kid was so familiar. So it\u2019s a relative of the landlady auntie! No wonder she\u2019s so sarcastic; it\u2019s exactly the same as her aunt! Each one was more sarcastic than the other!\u201cLandlady Auntie, this is\u2026..\u201d Zhang Ye asked.Rao Aimin looked at him, \u201cThis is my niece; my sister\u2019s child. She will be under my care from now on. You keep your eyes on her, too. Don\u2019t let her run around; this little imp is full of tricks.\u201dA puzzled Zhang Ye asked, \u201cUnder your care from now on? What about your sister and brother-in-law?\u201dRao Aimin\u2019s eyes did not betray any emotions as she replied calmly, \u201cThey passed away a long time ago. The child had been cared for by my brother-in-law\u2019s family in the past. Two days ago when I was not around, I was at the proceedings to take custody of her. Her surname will follow our Rao family.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d Zhang Ye understood that her family matters were probably a little complicated, so he did not probe further.\u201cOh, yes.\u201d Rao Aimin thought of something, \u201cI heard you resigned? How is it?\u201dZhang Ye nodded, \u201cIt\u2019s alright, Landlady Auntie. I did not want to continue there for some time already; thanks for your concern.\u201dRao Aimin looked at him, \u201cI\u2019m not concerned about you. I am concerned if you are able to pay your rent on time. It\u2019s almost the end of the month; if you can\u2019t pay up, then get out. No two ways about it.\u201dZhang Ye nearly vomited blood. You are too damn direct!At this time, Rao Chenchen also laughed at him derisively, \u201cHur Hur.\u201dRao Aimin agilely picked up Rao Chenchen with her hand and held her in her arm. A child of eight years old was not that small, but the landlady auntie did it without skipping a beat. It was as if she was carrying a beer bottle. She said to Zhang Ye, \u201cQuickly find a job next week. Who allowed this boy to curse at the award presentation ceremony? You deserve to lose your job, hur, but that poem of yours was quite appropriate. You had some of my style when I was younger!\u201dZhang Ye casually said, \u201cSure. I will look for a job after a few days\u2019 rest. Please don\u2019t worry. The rent will continue without break; I will definitely find a good workplace.\u201dRao Chenchen who was in her aunt\u2019s arms looked at Zhang Ye cross-eyed, her mouth stiffly smiling, \u201cHur Hur.\u201dHur Hur, what Hur Hur! Zhang Ye was utterly defeated by these two ladies. The landlady auntie\u2019s poisonous mouth was enough to give him nightmares. Great, now there\u2019s a little one, too!Could he live through this?Will this old and young one team up and come destroy him every day?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He handled no serious business, but instead used the break to readjust his condition and relax his mind. It\u2019s Monday now. Zhang Ye was planning to sleep until daybreak, but someone did not give him the chance to do so.It was only 6 in the morning.Someone was knocking at his door.Zhang Ye pretended not to hear it. He was still deep in his sleep.Bang, bang, bang. It had changed to pounding on his door. In a moment, a click sounded, a turn of keys. The door was unlocked from the outside.\u201cSee, he is at home!\u201d It was Rao Aimin who stepped into the house, \u201cThis rascal, he\u2019s always pretending not to hear!\u201dThe landlady auntie was holding the hands of a cute and beautiful little kid. It was Chenchen. He could only hear the little girl repeating her aunt\u2019s name for him, \u201cRascal.\u201dRao Aimin looked at her, \u201cThat\u2019s for me to call him that.\u201d\u201cThen I can call that, too.\u201d Chenchen said in a deadpan way.\u201cBe good and call him uncle; don\u2019t be so disrespectful.\u201d Rao Aimin educated her.Chenchen acknowledged, then deeply called him, \u201cUncle Rascal, get up quickly.\u201dZhang Ye, who was sleeping comfortably, was nearly driven mad by the two ladies\u2019 perfect harmony, as he pulled his hair, almost on the brink of collapse, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Landlady Auntie?\u201dRao Aimin began talking about important matters, \u201cI\u2019m going out soon. I had scheduled an appointment with the subdistrict and police station to settle Chenchen\u2019s residential information to be transferred over to me, so I haven\u2019t had time. However, Chenchen\u2019s school has a public class in the afternoon today. All the guardians have to be present to listen to the child\u2019s language class. I think there\u2019s a session with guardians and children writing a composition.\u201d Saying that, she thrusted Chenchen\u2019s hand over, \u201cI can\u2019t trust others with the child. Since you are also known as a Teacher, I\u2019ll hand Chenchen over to you. In a while, bring her to school. Just say are Chenchen\u2019s uncle.\u201dZhang Ye nearly fainted and quickly covered his head with his blanket, \u201cI\u2019m not going. I still have things to do during the day. I still need to submit my resumes, and\u2026\u201dRao Aimin kicked his leg that was dangling out of the bed without any reason, \u201cCut the crap and get up quickly! You have to go, even if you don\u2019t want to!\u201dZhang Ye was disagreeable towards it, \u201cDefinitely not. I\u2019m tired.\u201dChenchen glanced at Zhang Ye and spoke like a tiny adult, \u201cA lazy ass has lots of sh*t and urine.\u201d\u201cAnyway, I\u2019m handing the child to you. I\u2019m leaving.\u201d With that, Rao Aimin left. But before she left, she said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t finish the task, see how I will settle score with you later! If you do well with Chenchen in the morning, this big sister will cook and settle all your meals for the next few days!\u201d\u201cThat won\u2019t do.\u201d Zhang Ye was anxious, \u201cDon\u2019t go, Landlady Auntie. Landlady auntie?\u201dAs he sat up to shout, she had already disappeared, leaving little Chenchen gloomily staring at him with her big eyes. She gave off that laughter that made people want to faint, \u201cHur Hur.\u201dWhat a crappy child!Can you stop Hur Hur-ing!?As the two looked at each other in the eyes, Zhang Ye decided to roll over and carry on sleeping. Taking care of a child\u2026 How is he to take care of a child?One minute\u2026Five minutes\u2026Zhang Ye fell asleep again. He slept soundly.But suddenly, an uncute voice from Chenchen rang in his ear, \u201cZhang Ye! I\u2019m hungry!\u201d She even used her tiny arm to push his shoulder.Zhang Ye pulled her hand away, \u201cStop messing with me!\u201dChenchen ignored and carried on pushing him, \u201cI\u2019m hungry.\u201d\u201cAiyah, I\u2019m really succumbing to you.\u201d Zhang Ye may say so, but how can this fellow bear to let the child go hungry. No matter how sleepy he was, he got up and said unhappily, \u201cWhat do you want to eat?\u201dChenchen said confidently and straightforwardly, \u201cSoy milk and fried dough sticks.\u201d\u201cWhat fried dough sticks? My house only has instant noodles.\u201d Zhang Ye said.Chenchen constantly nagged, \u201cSoy milk and fried dough sticks, soy milk and fried dough sticks, soy milk\u2026\u201dZhang Ye got a headache, \u201cStop saying that already! Fine, fine, fine. Wait for me to change.\u201dHe finally understood that with this tiny thing beside him, there was no hope of him sleeping. Hence, after washing up, he looked for something to change into, and then brought Chenchen downstairs. They went to a breakfast stand across the street.The female boss approached with a smile, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\u201cTwo soy milk, three fried dough sticks. Thank you.\u201d Zhang Ye was very polite.\u201cSure, in a moment.\u201d The female boss gave a loving glance at Chenchen, \u201cIs this your child? She\u2019s so pretty. How gorgeous would she be when she grows up?\u201dZhang Ye was thinking that if he had such a wicked child, he wouldn\u2019t need to live his life ever again!\u2026Hepingmen.Beijing No.2 Experimental Primary School.There was also a subway station here. But as three transfers were needed, making it very inconvenient, Zhang Ye came with Chenchen using a public bus. It was a direct line on Route 70.\u201cGive me your hand.\u201d As they were about to cross the road, Zhang Ye held out his hand.Chenchen curled her lips, \u201cYou did not wash your hands after eating the fried dough sticks.\u201dZhang Ye was gloomy, \u201cDidn\u2019t you not wash, either? Hurry up! Why are you so troublesome?\u201d He was afraid that the road was dangerous, so he forcefully held onto Chenchen\u2019s hand.Chenchen gave a reluctant look as if she greatly despised him, but she followed Zhang Ye to the school gates while carrying a tiny school bag.Today, there was indeed a public class for second grade students. The moment that Zhang Ye entered the school, he saw many parents bringing their children in. Some children even had two parents beside them.\u201cChenchen!\u201d someone shouted.A young boy came running over with his parents.Chenchen gave him a glance, \u201cDede?\u201dThe little boy said in friendly fashion, \u201cYou came? Is this your dad?\u201dChenchen said nonchalantly, \u201cHe\u2019s my uncle. My father is much more handsome.\u201dDede\u2019s parents were amused hearing this. Dede\u2019s father took the initiative to stretch out his hand, \u201cHello.\u201dZhang Ye shook his hand, \u201cHello. Are the both of you here to join the public class? Aye, the school sure is something. The things they organize are getting more and more complex.\u201dDede\u2019s mother said, \u201cIndeed. Both of us needed to work today, but ended having to take time off. Hur Hur. There\u2019s no way around it. Children matter the most.\u201dDede was also trying to chat with Chenchen.\u201cDid you prepare today\u2019s composition?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cDid you do the homework our teacher assigned for the weekend?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cAh, why didn\u2019t you do it? You will be reprimanded by the teacher again. I\u2019ll let you copy mine. I did them.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need.\u201dIt was Dede who kept the conversation going, but Chenchen appeared uncaring.On Zhang Ye\u2019s side, he had already finished chatting with Dede\u2019s parents. They brought the children into the school building. Zhang Ye also held Chenchen\u2019s tiny hand and as they walked, he said, \u201cDede was chatting with you. Why were you so cold? You won\u2019t have friends in the future if you keep this up.\u201dChenchen said nonchalantly, \u201cWomen need to be more reserved.\u201dZhang Ye was dumbfounded, \u201cWho taught you that?\u201dChenchen said, \u201cMy aunt said it.\u201d\u201cLet me tell you something: don\u2019t keep learning from your aunt. Look at you. You are almost a duplicate of your aunt. Speak a bit more cutely and pleasing to others, understand?\u201d Zhang Ye taught with utmost care.Chenchen directly said, \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201dFine, treat it as if this Bro didn\u2019t say anything. Zhang Ye brought her to the classroom of the first class, second grade.\u201cAre you Dede\u2019s parents?\u201d\u201cRight, you are Qianqian\u2019s mother, right? Hur Hur, I always hear my son talk about Qianqian. The two children seem to hit it off well. Whenever you are free, you can come visit my house.\u201d\u201cAlright, let\u2019s communicate more.\u201dIn the classroom, there were quite a lot of parents introducing themselves to each other as they got to know each other.However, there was not much a reaction when Zhang Ye brought Chenchen in. Other than a few boys like Dede who were willing to speak to Chenchen, the rest ignored Chenchen. Some girls even gave her aversive looks. Zhang Ye finally understood. Indeed, little Chenchen was too unpopular in school.\u201cHey, the teacher is here.\u201d\u201cTeacher Zhao Mei, hello.\u201d\u201cTeacher Zhao, thank you for taking care of\u00a0our children.\u201dZhang Ye whispered to Chenchen, \u201cWho is she?\u201dChenchen said indifferently, \u201cZhao Mei, my class\u2019 teacher-in-charge. She always criticizes me!\u201dJust as she finished saying that, Teacher Zhao Mei saw Chenchen, and then her eyes stared right at Zhang Ye\u2019s face. She strode forward, \u201cYou must be Chenchen\u2019s guardian, right?\u201dZhang Ye said, \u201cAh, yes. I\u2019m her uncle.\u201dTeacher Zhao Mei\u2019s face turned sullen, \u201cI\u2019ve finally seen you. Uncle Chenchen, follow me.\u201d Saying that, she went to the end of a corridor.Zhang Ye could only follow, \u201cTeacher, what\u2019s the matter?\u201dTeacher Zhao Mei immediately said, \u201cWhat sort of guardians in the world are you people? Chenchen has been in school for a year. This is the second year, but this is the first time I\u2019m seeing her guardian. I heard that back when she first came to school, Chenchen had reported to school with her books and fees herself. Last year, I had been asking to see Chenchen\u2019s guardians for an entire year, but none of you came. Do you even care about the child? I\u2019ve been a teacher for so many years, but this is the first time I\u2019m seeing such seniors like you!\u201dZhang Ye was stunned, \u201cNo one brings Chenchen to school usually?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Teacher Zhao Mei asked angrily, \u201cYou even asked me? I stand at the school gates to greet students almost everyday. Chenchen always takes the bus herself to school!\u201dZhang Ye finally understood. It was no wonder the landlady auntie had gone through legal procedures to obtain the child\u2019s custody, because her brother-in-law\u2019s family didn\u2019t take good care of her, so he immediately explained, \u201cTeacher Zhao, it\u2019s like this. Chenchen\u2019s family situation is a bit more complicated. Her parents are no longer alive, and she had been under the care of her elders on her father\u2019s side. They were not very attentive. Now, with the child\u2019s custody in her aunt\u2019s hands, who is also a big sister of mine, I will guarantee you that this will not happen again. If you have any problems, just give her aunt a call, or even call me. I assure you, I will be available immediately.\u201d After understanding Chenchen\u2019s family situation, Zhang Ye felt pity for the child.She was just seven years old!She had gone to school herself? She probably even needed to make her own meals. No wonder Chenchen was so much more mature than her peers!Teacher Zhao Mei exclaimed, \u201cAh? Is that so? Aiyah, then I haven\u2019t been a good teacher-in-charge. Sorry, I didn\u2019t know before this.\u201d After sighing, she said, \u201cActually this child is very pitiful. No wonder she never got along well with her classmates.\u201dZhang Ye frowned, \u201cAre others bullying her?\u201dZhao Mei gave a wry smile, \u201cYou think too much. Who dares to bully Chenchen. If she doesn\u2019t bully others, I\u2019ll already be praying to the gods. As a guardian, you should know Chenchen\u2019s mouth better than me. Many of the young children in class have cried because of her words. Not only children, even her math teacher, a new teacher who just came for a year, nearly got sick from the stress due to Chenchen, and even had to take several days off!\u201dZhang Ye said in an ashamed manner, \u201cHow can this be?\u201d\u201cWhy not?\u201d Zhao Mei also felt angry and funny at the same time as she said, \u201cA few days ago when school opened, the math teacher had just been assigned to our class. On the first day, the teacher had asked Chenchen to answer a question, but Chenchen could not answer. When the teacher reprimanded her, Chenchen retorted with a question that no mathematician could prove. In the end, Chenchen even said that since the teacher could not answer, then she had no right in demanding that she answer the teacher\u2019s question! There was also the language teacher. She could not stand in anymore with Chenchen and even left the classroom with her materials!\u201dZhang Ye coughed, \u201cI\u2019ll speak to her about it. This child is not very sensible.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t say things so heavily. Treat it slow and progress slowly. I can tell that she is a good child, but she doesn\u2019t trust people easily. Hai, maybe it\u2019s due to her family situation.\u201d Zhao Mei could understand and felt pity, \u201cA family\u2019s influence on a child is too great.\u201dZhang Ye said, \u201cI\u2019ll have to trouble you in the future.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll try my best.\u201d Looking at her watch, she said, \u201cClass is starting soon. There will be Leaders from the Education Ministry coming today. Chenchen\u2019s guardian, please take a seat.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Returning to the classroom, Zhang Ye saw Chenchen sitting alone by herself. He felt his heart go soft. He went over to straighten her ruffled hair and adjust her school uniform\u2019s collar. Then, he brought a seat to sit beside the child, just like the other parents were doing by their children.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A forty-something-year-old female teacher holding some lesson plans entered the classroom, \u201cGood morning, students.\u201d\u201cAttention!\u201d a class representative shouted.Everyone stood up at the same time, \u201cGood morning, teacher!\u201dThe language teacher smiled, \u201cStudents, please be seated.\u201dThe other children were pretty well-behaved and listened to instructions accordingly, except for Chenchen. Her movements were slower by a beat, without any spirit and a look of disinterest. It was like she was not properly fed her meals. Zhang Ye had never seen Chenchen smile sincerely before, not even once. Her smile was always \u201cHur Hur\u201d, like a cold sneer which always hung from her face.Zhang Ye prodded her, \u201cPay attention.\u201dLittle Chenchen just nodded in acknowledgment.The female teacher hearing some commotion, immediately looked towards Chenchen and said with a sudden displeasure, \u201cKeep quiet; it\u2019s class time now!\u201d before putting on a smile again and saying to the parents, \u201cGood morning, parents. Today is a public exhibition class, so I would like to thank everyone for taking time off to attend. As for today\u2019s lesson plan, I would like it to be more interactive. I will be giving a question for the students to write an essay piece of at least 200 words. Parents may supervise, advise or work on it together with your child. This is to let our parents understand our children\u2019s world and improve our interactions with them. Alright, I will now begin the question.\u201dShe turned around and wrote some words on the blackboard.Title: Sing the praise of any type of plant.Requirements: The theme is to be clearly written, with at least 200 words used.The form teacher of the class, Zhao Mei, was seated at the back of the classroom, observing every student\u2019s performance.Clapping her hands, the language teacher announced to everyone, \u201cAlright, students, You may start writing. If you are unsure of any words, you can ask your parent for help.\u201d\u201cDad, I want to write about roses!\u201d\u201cSure. That is good.\u201d\u201cBut I don\u2019t know how to spell \u2018rose\u2019.\u201d\u201cHere, let dad write it out for you.\u201d\u201cMummy, mummy, I want to sing a praise for the Cathaya plant. Ah, orchids are not bad, too; the orchids we have at home are very pretty. Didn\u2019t you say that they were extremely famous and expensive?\u201dEveryone started moving their pens.Only Chenchen kept still for a long time. She was biting on her pen without writing a single word. In the end, she turned her head and looked at Zhang Ye, \u201cZhang Ye.\u201dZhang Ye asked, \u201cWhat?\u201dChenchen\u2019s heart did not miss a beat as she passed her pen to him, \u201cWrite it for me.\u201dZhang Ye stared at her, \u201cThe teacher gave the assignment to you; we adults at most can teach you to write some unknown words. You are really thick skinned. Hurry up and write it yourself.\u201dChenchen lowered her voice, \u201cI don\u2019t know how to.\u201dZhang Ye tried encouraging her, \u201cWhat\u2019s there to not know how? Think about which plant is good and which one you like, then write what is good about it and how it is pretty. That is all. Aren\u2019t you very good at talking? Your vocabulary should be much greater than others of your age. You can definitely do it.\u201d This little kid had someone like Zhang Ye, someone who was good at speaking and who had worked as a radio host, at his wits end. Zhang Ye knew that Chenchen was especially clever.But Chenchen just could not write. She laid there for half a day without writing anything. It was obvious that Chenchen was getting frustrated.Suddenly, there was a rush of footsteps coming from outside.The school Leader had arrived, along with several people who looked like they were from the Beijing Education Bureau\u2019s chiefs. There were about 20 of them in a row, men and women, young and old.The language teacher quickly greeted, \u201cDirector Liu. Principal Li.\u201dNo.2 Experimental Primary School\u2019s Principal Li lowered his hands, \u201cCarry on. You don\u2019t have to bother about us.\u201dThe form teacher, Zhao Mei, also stood up to welcome them and showed them the pre-arranged seats at the back of the class, \u201cPlease take a seat, everyone. The children are all writing an essay for their language class.\u201dDirector Liu from the Education Bureau said pleasantly, \u201cThat\u2019s great. We have to hear some of the children\u2019s essays.\u201dZhang Ye swept his vision to the back and understood that they had likely arranged an exhibition class because of the Leaders visitation. Eh, this was so troublesome. Formalism was really a pain in the ass.Soon after, the language teacher looked at her watch, \u201cOkay, time\u2019s almost up. Whoever has finished writing, please put up your hands. I will read, hur hur. As this is an experimental class, the first placed for today\u2019s essay writing will be broadcast during the school\u2019s broadcast period. This is a rare opportunity.\u201dWhen they heard, the children became all eager and excited!\u201cI\u2019ve finished writing!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve finished writing, too!\u201d\u201cRead mine first! Read mine first!\u201dEveryone was very enthusiastic; the children all had the urge to show what they could do.Principal Li was very glad. He told the Leader, \u201cDirector Liu, this is our school\u2019s best experimental class of grade 2. The children are all very motivated.\u201d\u201cI saw it.\u201d Director Liu praised \u201cVery good.\u201dOnly Rao Chenchen lowered her head and did not make a sound. Her essay book was still blank. When Chenchen looked around and saw her classmates all raising their hands, she slowly pursed up her mouth.Zhang Ye could not bear the sight of this. He bit his teeth and did not care anymore, if I have to write, so be it. This child cannot afford to lose her confidence in front of her classmates. Moreover, the language teacher had been angered by Chenchen before. If she were to rub it in, Chenchen will further be ostracized. This was something that Zhang Ye did not want to see happen. The landlady auntie had always helped him when he was at his lowest. Big Sister Rao had entrusted the child to his care, so Zhang Ye definitely would not let the child suffer while under his care.\u201cChenchen.\u201d Zhang Ye whispered, \u201cI will read, you write.\u201dChenchen pursed her mouth and nodded. For once, she did not rebutt Zhang Ye\u2019s words.But what should they write? Praise which kind of plant? Zhang Ye\u2019s head was blank, too. But all of a sudden, he had an idea. Yes, that\u2019s the one!Chenchen urged him on, \u201cZhang Ye.\u201d\u201cAlright, don\u2019t rush me. I have something.\u201d Zhang Ye said, \u201cThe subject \u2014 \u2018Tribute to the White Poplar\u2019. The white poplar is no ordinary tree. Let me sing its praises.\u201dChenchen\u2019s writing was extremely fast. With a few strokes of the pen, she was caught up.Zhang Ye continued on, \u201cWhen you travel by car through Northwest China\u2019s boundless plateau, all that you see before you is something like a huge yellow-and-green felt blanket. Yellow is the soil \u2014 the uncultivated virgin soil. It is the outer covering of the Loess Plateau, accumulated by Mother Nature several hundred thousand years ago. Green are the wheat fields signifying man\u2019s triumph over nature. They become a sea of rolling green waves whenever there is a soft breeze. Here, one is reminded of the Chinese expression \u2018\u9ea6\u6d6a\u2019, meaning \u2018rippling wheat\u2019 and cannot help admiring our forefathers\u2019 ingenuity in coining such a happy phrase.\u201dChenchen did not know some of the words, as she had not learned them. Zhang Ye guided her with instructions on how to write them.\u2026Over there, the language teacher had already picked up Dede\u2019s essay, \u201cDede raised his hands up first, so I will read his essay first. \u201cViolet\u201d. \u201cI like the violet. Once, dad and mum brought me on a trip to Europe. I first saw them in a courtyard. They were so beautiful\u2026..\u201d after reciting, the language teacher praised, \u201cWell-written. I could see Dede\u2019s heart in this; the words were also quite good.\u201dDede was spoilt by the praise.Dede\u2019s dad and mom also smiled. They felt proud of their son.\u201cThere. Tongtong raised her hand. Let me take a look at Tongtong\u2019s essay.\u201d The language teacher picked up the little girl\u2019s essay, \u201cPraising the Cedar\u201d. \u201cThe Cedar is one of the most treasured trees in the world. Because of overharvesting, many of the ancient cedars no longer exist\u2026\u201d she finished reading. The language teacher\u2019s eyes lit up, \u201cTongtong\u2019s essay is even better. Compared to Dede\u2019s essay, there is more depth and the concept of environmental conservation. It\u2019s really quite good; please continue to work hard.\u201d\u201cThank you, teacher.\u201d Tongtong grinned. She looked over at Chenchen\u2019s table and gave her a look of arrogance, like she was showing off. It can be seen that her relationship with Chenchen wasn\u2019t too good.1 essay\u2026..3 essays\u2026..5 essays\u2026..Every student\u2019s essay had been read out.At last, the language teacher asked, \u201cWho else has finished, but not let me read it?\u201dTongtong suddenly said loudly, \u201cRao Chenchen\u2019s essay has not been read yet.\u201d She pointed towards her.Tongtong\u2019s dad who was by her side, looked over at Rao Chenchen and Zhang Ye. His glance was a bit cold and he said cynically, \u201cThat\u2019s right; I also want to hear Student Chenchen\u2019s writing.\u201d Last school semester, Chenchen had made his Tongtong cry a few times, so Tongtong\u2019s father was obviously not very pleased with them. He had purposely found fault with them, \u201cChenchen\u2019s guardian, are you already done? Then recite it for teacher. Chenchen\u2019s educational performance can be said to be \u2018outstanding\u2019, so her composition must be very well-written!\u201dEveryone in class knew that Chenchen\u2019s educational performance was bad; in fact, she was one of the last few in the class!Many of the children who did not play with Chenchen were now gloating and booing at her.\u201cRead it, Chenchen!\u201d\u201cI also want to hear Chenchen\u2019s essay!\u201dThe language teacher had not wanted to read Chenchen\u2019s essay. It was not like she didn\u2019t know about Chenchen\u2019s language standard. She was the class\u2019 worst student, and was likely to be kicked out of the experimental class next year. Today, it was a public class, so with so many teachers and school Leaders, and even Leaders from the Education Bureau present, she naturally wanted to choose the best works to be recited. By doing so, she could highlight her teaching abilities. Hence, she said, \u201cChenchen might not have finished writing.\u201dTongtong\u2019s father sneered, \u201cI saw her stop writing a while ago!\u201dTeacher-in-charge, Zhao Mei, who was in the back of the class, was a bit mad. What sort of parent was this!? Why did you have to treat another person\u2019s child like this? Was there a need to mock others? Yes, Chenchen might have a sharp mouth, and had made your child cry, but don\u2019t you know that you should not take offense at a child\u2019s babble? Furthermore, that was also the child\u2019s own matter. Why must you, as an adult, step in and help your child bully another? What sort of words were those!? Ever since she knew of Rao Chenchen\u2019s family background and history, Zhao Mei\u2019s attitude towards Chenchen completely changed. She also became very tolerant.Zhang Ye was also mad. He stared at Tongtong\u2019s father. Grandson, what sort of words are you saying!? Are you finding fault with me? Fine!\u201cChenchen, you?\u201d The language teacher queried, and also signaled to Chenchen with her eyes, indicating that it was fine if she just said that she was not done writing.But before Chenchen sounded out, Zhang Ye spoke up, \u201cMy child is done writing! Since everyone wants to listen to it, then read it!\u201dThe language teacher was stunned. Holy sh*t, are you really reciting it?Tongtong\u2019s father laughed, \u201cTeacher, we are all waiting.\u201dThe Leaders from the Education Bureau and school could not bare watching this any further. They felt that some parents parents was lacking in bearing, so they did not plan to carry on listening. They got up and were about to inspect other classes.At this moment, the language teacher had already taken the composition from Chenchen\u2019s hands. The moment she looked at it, she was at first stunned. There was nothing else. There were too many words in this composition, and it had far exceeded 200 words. She wrote so many words? You can write so many words just to compliment a plant? She then read with a skeptical tone, \u201cTitle: \u2018Tribute to the White Poplar\u2019. The white poplar is no ordinary tree. Let me sing its praises!\u201dWhen the first sentence came out, everyone was amused.Singing the praises for the white poplar? And it was no ordinary tree? You must be kidding! There were damn white poplar trees everywhere on the streets, and most of them were in the rural areas. What was the meaning of praising this plant? Look at what the other classmates were writing. They wrote about orchids, cedar or lavender. Even the worst of the worst was praising roses!What about you?Praising the white poplar?Man, why didn\u2019t you praise the oil waste in the sewers!Quite a number of children mocked, and a few adults, like Tongtong\u2019s father, laughed together with the children. They looked disdainful! A rotten child was a rotten child! They could not do anything! What sort of crappy composition was this!? Aren\u2019t you even ashamed to use it to compare with my child\u2019s composition?The language teacher also felt there was a problem with the composition. The title itself wasn\u2019t well chosen, but there was no other way. With a few parents purposely forcing the situation, she had to carry on reading, but the more she read, the more astonished she became. Her expression became more and more surprised!This\u2026This was prose?Only then did she realize that the composition was not as simple as she thought. The words may have been simple and uncomplicated, but there was something amiss in it!\u201cWith straight trunks and branches, white poplars aim high.\u201d\u201cWhite poplars are no ordinary trees. But these common trees in Northwest China are as much ignored as our peasants in the North. However, like our peasants in the North, they are bursting with vitality and capable of surviving any hardship or oppression. I pay tribute to them because they symbolize our peasants in the North and, in particular, the spirit of honesty, tenacity and forging ahead \u2014 a spirit central to our struggle for national liberation.\u201d\u201cThe reactionary diehards, who spite and snub the common people, can do whatever they like to eulogize the elite nanmu (which is also tall, straight and good-looking) and look down upon the common, fast-growing white poplar. I, \u2014 for my part, will be loud in my praise of the latter!\u201dThe language teacher closed Chenchen\u2019s composition book and said in a daze, \u201cEnd.\u201dShe had finished reciting the composition!Everyone at this moment was silent!Tongtong\u2019s father was dumbfounded!The other parents were in a daze!The Education Bureau and school leaders who had just walked out the classroom also stood in their original spots for no reason. Then.. one by one, they quickly returned. They looked in shock at the classroom, as if they had seen a ghost!Zhang Ye began to be the braggart he was and scoffed at the parents who questioned Chenchen and him. You really despised me as a dog!?Show off! Show off some more to me!Competing with me at compositions? All of you are sure funny!Zhang Ye was not surprised at the astonishment of everyone. Was I joking with you? This was the \u2018Tribute to the White Poplar\u2019. If he did not remember wrongly, this was a famous essay in his world\u2019s second grade textbooks. And its author was even more famous: Mao Dun!Zhang Ye would spit at anyone who could find fault with this essay. \u2018Tribute to the White Poplar\u2019 did not have flowery language, and also did not have complicated vocabulary, but it was because of this that the value of this essay was highlighted. Only then could it highlight the ideological, educational and literary value of the essay!An essay that praised items?\u2018Tribute to the White Poplar\u2019 was the most inconspicuous one! But it was also the most famous one!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The rowdy children and parents were all fixed in their spots!Astonishment!Astonishment!And more astonishment!Teacher-in-charge Zhao Mei gaped, \u201cThis essay\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2018Tribute to the White Poplar\u2019! What an excellent \u2018Tribute to the White Poplar\u2019!\u201d The Education Bureau\u2019s Director Liu applauded and praised it. This shout also broke the silent scene. He looked slightly over-excited, and it was obvious he was not just a Leader. There was an 80% chance he was a teacher or scholar who was involved in education in the past. \u201cThe text is plain, and could even be said to be simple. There is no uncommon word or complex rhetoric in it. It does not look like prose at all, but it is this kind of text that perfectly harmonizes with the topic to an extreme. A common white poplar, simple peasants in the North. It might be writing about plants, and furthermore, a very inconspicuous tree, yet in actuality it is expressing the greatness and power of the common people!\u201dAnother person from the Education Bureau was also extremely shocked, \u201cThis\u2026 This is practically a model essay out of model essays! Currently, in all the mainstream textbooks, be it in elementary, middle or high school, there is no other educative model essay as this! How could this be written by a child!? And a eight-year-old child at that?\u201dPrincipal Li immediately asked, \u201cWho wrote it?\u201dThe language teacher said in a daze, \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 It\u2019s written by our class\u2019 Chenchen!\u201dPrincipal Li nearly fainted, \u201cI meant, who was the real author of this essay!\u201dWhich of them was dumb? Furthermore, even a person with intellectual disabilities could tell that this plain on the surface, but riddled with layers of profoundness, essay was clearly not written by an eight-year-old child. Ignoring an eight-year-old student, even among them, who were in education all their lives, there was not any one of them who would be able to write such an outstanding model essay even at the age of eighty! They did not have that literary foundation! They were almost certain that the person who could write a prose like \u2018Tribute to the White Poplar\u2019 was no ordinary person!Famous author?Scholar?Or which professor?They were all trying to guess!The language teacher gave a wry smile, \u201cPrincipal Li, I, I do not know either.\u201d Immediately looking towards Rao Chenchen, she asked, \u201cChenchen, who wrote the essay for you?\u201dChenchen said without being ashamed, \u201cI wrote it.\u201dZhao Mei immediately said, \u201cThe Leader and Principal are here. Chenchen, say it truthfully; who prepared this essay in advance for you? It\u2019s alright. We won\u2019t say anything bad.\u201d Of course, they could not criticize Chenchen. Today\u2019s language public class\u2019 topic was meant for parents and children to write an essay together. For example, in Tongtong\u2019s save-the-environment kind of essay, it did not look like Tongtong\u2019s work at all, with its terms or deeper meaning. It was definitely prepared by Tongtong\u2019s father ahead of time. Quite a large number of other students were also ghostwriters for their parents. After all, it was a parent\u2019s heart. No one would like their child to be embarrassed in such a public setting, so the teachers understood this.Chenchen said with a calm face, \u201cIt was written by me.\u201d She did not lie, but she added on, and looked towards Zhang Ye, \u201cI wrote it while my uncle read it.\u201dYour uncle?He was the original author?Immediately, everyone\u2019s eyes landed on Zhang Ye!As Zhang Ye was too young, everyone gave a suspicious look. Who was this? Not familiar? Never seen him before? He could write such an essay at such an age? That can\u2019t be! Principal Li, Director Liu and company had their doubts.Principal Li asked, \u201cYou are?\u201dZhang Ye said, \u201cI\u2019m Chenchen\u2019s uncle.\u201d\u201cI mean\u2026 How do I address you?\u201d Principal Li said with a skeptical tone.Without waiting for Zhang Ye to respond, Rao Chenchen said with a hoarse voice quickly, \u201cMy uncle\u2019s name is Zhang Ye (\u5f20\u70e8), written with a \u706b and a \u534e.\u201d\u201cZhang Ye?\u201d The language teacher was immediately stunned!Principal Li was also shocked, \u201cYou are that Zhang Ye? The Zhang Ye who wrote \u2018Shuidiao Getou\u2019? The original author who won first place in the essay competition with \u2018Little Bunnies Be Good\u2019?\u201dZhang Ye smiled, \u201cThat\u2019s me.\u201d Hehe, I didn\u2019t know this bro was so famous in the education system.However, there were only these few people who knew him. The other parents did not know him. They only knew Zhang Ye was probably quite an impressive person, given Principal Li and the language teacher\u2019s surprised expressions.Director Liu laughed, \u201cSo it\u2019s Teacher Zhang Ye. No wonder, no wonder you can write an essay such as \u2018Tribute to the White Poplar\u2019!\u201dIf it was any other person, how could a young lad just past the age of twenty be able to write \u2018Tribute to the White Poplar\u2019 on the spot? They would definitely not believe it, as it was impossible. But the author was Zhang Ye, the famous Zhang Ye. There was no need to talk about his other works. Just think of \u2018The Song of the Stormy Petrel\u2019, which shocked the online world was written by Zhang Ye.Both essays were writing about living things. One was written about an animal, while the other was written about a plant. One was a prose poem, while the other was also prose. The common theme was clear; they were using a living thing as an allegory. \u201cThe Song of the Stormy Petrel\u201d was using the petrel to express one\u2019s resistance and fearlessness, while \u201cTribute to the White Poplar\u201d was using the white poplar to express the greatness and simplicity of the ubiquitous people.They had different themes, but the same feeling!Hence, there were no doubts about his authenticity after they knew he was Zhang Ye. Zhang Ye was the only literature author in the country who could write such an essay at his age. Of course, there were other young people who wrote well, and they were also about the same age as Zhang Ye, but the problem was they were just not bad. No peer of Zhang Ye could reach his standard! The difference in quality in the works was too great!The language teacher exclaimed, \u201cYou are really Zhang Ye?\u201dZhang Ye blinked, \u201cThat\u2019s me. Why?\u201d\u201cNothing, nothing, I\u2026 Nevermind. I\u2019ll talk to you after the class has ended.\u201d The language teacher seemed to have something on her mind.Director Liu then said, \u201cRight; there\u2019s still class. Come, let\u2019s go behind and continue listening. Let\u2019s not disrupt the children from their lesson.\u201dThe people from the Education Bureau and teachers all sat in the back row. With the appearance of \u201cTribute to the White Poplar\u201d , they no longer had any intentions of visiting other classes.Principal Li said after taking his seat, \u201cTeacher, carry on. Don\u2019t bother about us.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d The language teacher calmed her mood and said to everyone, \u201cStudents, just now you heard \u2018Tribute to the White Poplar\u2019 once. From the looks of everyone, you might not understand why this essay is good, and it can\u2019t be blamed. This prose is not something easily understood at your age, because its essence and excellence is not on its surface, but within. I really wish each one of you will be like the white poplar, and using Chenchen\u2019s uncle\u2019s words\u2026 With straight trunks and branches, aim high, stand erect and be unbending in face of a violent wind.\u201dThe children all looked towards Chenchen.\u201cActually, I need to be self-critical of myself.\u201d The language teacher said honestly, \u201cJust now when I read the first sentence of \u2018Tribute to the White Poplar\u2019, I had some contempt in my heart. Like everyone else, I also find the white poplar mundane. Praising the white poplar? What was there to praise? But after I finished reading it, I knew I was wrong. A rose may be beautiful, but it easily withers. The orchid may be beautiful, but it is easily bent. The white poplar might look ugly, but I think they are much more beautiful than them. It is beautiful in the sense of striving for excellence. It is an unyielding beauty. This is a ubiquitous beauty!\u201dThe language teacher\u2019s evaluation of it was of a certain standard.After hearing this, everyone applauded!Director Liu and Principal Li also nodded and gave their applause!\u201cJust now when I recited \u2018Tribute to the White Poplar\u2019, I had some uncertainty and hesitation. So my tone was not right at times. Actually, I also do not have the ability to recite it properly. I wish to invite Teacher Zhang Ye to recite it once. I\u2019m not sure if Teacher Zhang is willing to?\u201d The language teacher suddenly said, \u201cYou might not know this, but Teacher Zhang Ye is a professional in this line of work. His profession is a broadcasting host, but he is also an author. His recitation will definitely be better than mine by a hundred times. Hur Hur, students, let us give a round of a applause for Teacher Zhang Ye to recite.\u201dThere was applause once again.Director Liu also greatly wanted to hear how Zhang Ye recited it. Principal Li might not have heard Zhang Ye\u2019s live performance, but Director Liu had happened to listen to an audio upload of Zhang Ye\u2019s recital of \u201cDead Water\u201d onstage at the Silver Microphone Awards ceremony. That mocking tone, that sarcasm and that anger, with no scruples about cursing, could be felt throughout the recitation. Back then, Director Liu had even stood up and slammed his table when he heard it. It was too exciting!Zhang Ye was not willing to incur ridicule on himself. However, Chenchen kept stabbing him with her little elbow, \u201cZhang Ye! Zhang Ye!\u201dZhang Ye could only stand up, \u201cAlright, then. Since the teacher has said so, I\u2019ll incur ridicule on myself today. If I don\u2019t recite it well, please don\u2019t fault me.\u201d Following that, he did not take Chenchen\u2019s composition book. He did not need to see it. He walked to the podium and closed his eyes to steady his breath. It was his habit, and also a breathing technique taught in his broadcasting college. This was because recitation was not a simple matter. It needed to be recited with emotion. Amateurs might think that it was simple, as it was just reading an essay, but only professionals knew the trade well. Zhang Ye was a professional at this, so he was not sloppy at all.He calmly said, \u201cTribute to the White Poplar.\u201dImmediately following that, Zhang Ye gave a smile. It was a smile exuding confidence that ignored everyone, \u201cThe white poplar is no ordinary tree. Let me sing its praises!\u201dSmile.Frown.Coldness.Eccentricity.Zhang Ye\u2019s visual interpretation of this essay was extremely good!The children were fascinated listening to him. Not even them, even the parents and the language teacher were watching with respect and shock!A professional was indeed a professional!It was indeed completely different from how the teacher had read it!Especially when Zhang Ye read the last line, his fanatical smile made people feel a rush, \u201cThe reactionary diehards, who spite and snub the common people, can do whatever they like to eulogize the elite nanmu and look down upon the common, fast-growing white poplar. I, \u2014 for my part, will be loud in my praise of the latter!\u201dBba Bba Bba!The applause this time reverberated through the entire corridor!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They were chatting outside, and those with smoking addictions even hid in the bathroom to smoke.\u201cEh? Why is there such a commotion in the first class?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Is the teacher teaching?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not teaching; I heard the experimental class is writing compositions today.\u201d\u201cOh, a student\u2019s essay? Let\u2019s go and take a look.\u201d\u201cAlright, but we should be quiet. There\u2019s the school\u2019s Leaders and teachers in there.\u201dSoon, a number of curious parents had come outside of the first class. They had happened to hear Zhang Ye\u2019s recitation of that \u201cTribute to the White Poplar\u201d!A parent touched the goose bumps on his arm. He was alarmed.The other parents were also stunned. A person looked at the other parent from before, \u201cFriend, are you sure this is a composition written by an elementary school student?\u201dThe person wiped his sweat, \u201cThat\u2019s right; their class is having a composition writing public lesson.\u201dThe parents were all feeling amazed. Were elementary school students so impressive these days?\u2026A few minutes later, The public lesson ended.\u201cEnd of class.\u201d\u201cRise.\u201d\u201cGoodbye, students.\u201d\u201cGoodbye, teacher.\u201dThe language teacher smiled, \u201cThank you to all the parents who came. Today\u2019s lesson will end here, so you can bring your children home. Today\u2019s homework is for everyone to write a reflective piece after you read \u2018Tribute to the White Poplar\u2019. Tomorrow, I will check them in class.\u201dThe moment that the lesson ended, Chenchen\u2019s seat was surrounded by all the other children!\u201cChenchen! Your uncle is so awesome!\u201d Dede was the first to run over.Chenchen was unlike her peers who would be smug in such a situation. She still had that grumpy little face of hers as she nonchalantly said, \u201cPassable.\u201d\u201cIs your uncle a superstar?\u201d Another boy asked, \u201cWhy do the principal and the teachers know him?\u201dChenchen quietly kept her pencil case and books, saying, \u201cI guess so. I didn\u2019t know he was that famous.\u201d\u201cChenchen, let\u2019s go home together.\u201d\u201cI want to go, too. Let my father drive us home.\u201d\u201cChenchen, Chenchen, do you want to come to my house and play? My house is nearby.\u201dA group of boys and girls surrounded her, asking all sorts of questions. They were very friendly.Zhang Ye also felt relieved when he saw the current situation. He was greatly wishing to see this little rascal have good relationships with her classmates. Actually, little Chenchen was pretty and cute, like a porcelain doll, and probably no child in the school was prettier than her. From an aesthetic point of view, most people would be willing to play with her; however, as little Chenchen was too cold, and was mature beyond her years, this resulted in her not mixing well with others. After today\u2019s matter, there was reason to believe that Chenchen\u2019s interpersonal relationships would improve. This was also the only thing that Zhang Ye could do.Tongtong and her father were already silent at this moment. The father brought his daughter out of the class. He did not want to stay a second longer, for he felt disgraced.\u201cTeacher Zhang Ye!\u201d The language teacher suddenly walked over.Zhang Ye, who was about to bring the child home, stopped in his tracks. He recalled that she had said something in class, something about talking after class. He then asked, \u201cTeacher, previously, you were saying?\u201dThe language teacher was a bit embarrassed. She did not look much older than Zhang Ye, and she had also not graduated for more than two years. After she hesitated for a moment, she took out a book, \u201cActually, actually, it\u2019s nothing important, just that\u2026 I especially like your poems. I have seen your \u2018Flying Bird and Fish\u2019, \u2018The Song of the Stormy Petrel\u2019 and \u2018A Generation\u2019 more than ten times. I can even recite them without a mistake now. Especially that \u2018Dead Water\u2019 you recited a few days ago.. I like that the most. I am one of your hardcore fans!\u201dUpon hearing this, Zhang Ye felt embarrassed, \u201cAh? Thank you, thank you.\u201dThe language teacher held the book and looked at him, \u201cCould I have an autograph? My husband also likes you. He likes your \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019. He stays up late every night to tune in to it. He has not missed a single episode!\u201dZhang Ye immediately took the book over, \u201cThere\u2019s definitely no problem at all. How many do you want?\u201d\u201cOne\u2026 No, two would be best.\u201d The language teacher was very happy as she passed him a pen.Zhang Ye\u2019s words were not very nicely written, but that was his normal handwriting. When it came to autographs, it might seem funny, but this rascal had purposely practiced before. He had wished to be famous since he was young, fantasizing about being asked for an autograph one day. He finally had his wish fulfilled today. Come to think of it, this was the first time a fan had asked for his autograph. It was a day worth remembering.\u201cHere\u2019s the autograph.\u201d Zhang Ye returned the book to her.\u201cThank you! Thank you!\u201d The language teacher was especially excited.Chenchen gave a cold glance over.Zhang Ye then touched little Chenchen\u2019s head and said to the language teacher, \u201cThis child Chenchen is not very sensible and not very obedient, so I\u2019ll be troubling you in the future.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, too welcome.\u201d The language teacher immediately said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll definitely teach the child well.\u201d Saying that, she whispered, noticing that there were no adults around, \u201cActually, with Chenchen\u2019s results, she might be transferred out of the experimental class this or next semester, but\u2026 I will definitely help Chenchen fight for it, so that she won\u2019t be transferred.\u201dZhang Ye said, \u201cThen I\u2019ll have to thank you.\u201dAt this moment, the teacher-in-charge, Zhao Mei, briskly walked over, \u201cTeacher Zhang, give me your autograph, too. I am a loyal protector of your children\u2019s fairytales. Hur Hur, back then for \u2018Little Bunnies Be Good\u2019, I had even activated the school\u2019s teachers to vote for you. However, I like \u2018Snow White and the Seven Dwarves\u2019 the most.\u201d\u201cThen I have to give you an autograph. Thank you for the support.\u201d Zhang Ye gave an autograph to Zhao Mei.After finishing this, Zhang Ye bade farewell to a few teachers and reached out his hands, saying to Chenchen, \u201cLet\u2019s go. Time to eat lunch at home.\u201dChenchen again revealed those eyes of contempt, but she still obediently placed her tiny hand into Zhang Ye\u2019s big hand, allowing him to hold her hand.Zhang Ye led the child out of the classroom.The other parents and children that had not left watched as they left, while they discussed about them.\u2026Afternoon.Jiaomen East.With the two reaching downstairs, they took an elevator up the building.Zhang Ye bragged, \u201cHow was it, little rascal? Now you know the awesomeness of Uncle Zhang, right? Don\u2019t be too impolite to your Uncle Zhang in the future. You must learn to be respectful of your elders.\u201dChenchen smirked, \u201cHur Hur.\u201dZhang Ye \u201c\u2026\u201dWith the elevator reaching the floor, Zhang Ye led her to the landlady\u2019s house and pressed the doorbell.In a short while, Rao Aimin, who was wearing an apron and had her hair tied up, opened the door, \u201cYou\u2019re back? Wash your hands and prepare to eat.\u201dRao Chenchen returned to her own room. Zhang Ye entered the kitchen with Rao Aimin, hoping to help. But noticing the table was full of dishes, he was shocked. \u201cLandlady Auntie, what\u2019s the occasion today? Why are there so many dishes? Is someone else coming? How many people are eating?\u201dRao Aimin stir-fried some vegetables as she said, \u201cIt\u2019s just the three of us.\u201d\u201cThen that\u2019s too much. How can the three of us have such big appetites?\u201d Zhang Ye found it extravagant.Rao Aimin did not even look at him, \u201cWhy are you saying so much crap? Just wait and eat.\u201d Pausing, she said, \u201cChenchen\u2019s teacher called me just now and told me what happened in school. Not bad; I didn\u2019t know that you were quite that famous. Even the teacher knows you?\u201dZhang Ye flaunted, \u201cThat\u2019s right. It\u2019s only you who keeps trampling on me. I\u2019m not bragging. My popularity\u2026 Let\u2019s not talk about it!\u201dRao Aimin shrugged her shoulders, \u201cHur Hur.\u201dFollowing that, Rao Chenchen, who just came in, also smirked, \u201cHur Hur.\u201dThe two ladies had given the mocking laughter at almost the same time. Even their expressions looked identical, like they were carbon copies, making Zhang Ye extremely depressed.You\u2019re the Hur Hur! Your whole damned family is Hur Hur!*\u2026In his own house.After returning home, he held his stomach and burped. It was too delicious. The landlady might be unsparing with her words, and could be as negative as she could, but her cooking was par excellence. Anyways, Zhang Ye had completely succumbed to the landlady\u2019s culinary skills. Although he had previously eaten Rao Aimin\u2019s cooking, it was clear that she had not put her heart into it. It was like the food had been prepared by a completely different person. It could be seen that the landlady was using such a method to thank him for his help today, which was why she put in so much more effort into the meal.Delicious!His stomach was exploding!Zhang Ye climbed before his computer. As he digested, he surfed the internet. Ever since he entered the E-list celebrity ranks, there were many people who @ him. He did not find it tiring, and looked at every one of them. After spending an hour, he finally saw the newest one and was immediately focused on it.The person who posted it was called \u201cThe Skies for the Children\u201d.\u201cToday I saw my idol Teacher @Zhang Ye. Due to certain reasons, I won\u2019t say how I met him. But thankfully, I received two of Teacher Zhang Ye\u2019s autographs. And I\u2019m very honored to have listened to Zhang Ye recite his new work live, which was a prose. Weibo doesn\u2019t allow too many words, so I\u2019ll include the essay in an attached picture. The words are written by a child, so everyone can ignore that.\u201dThe entire text of \u201cTribute to the White Poplar\u201d was posted.This was a picture of Chenchen\u2019s notebook, taken using a cellphone.Zhang Ye knew at once that the person who posted it was the language teacher. He immediately helped by forwarding it.\u201cTeacher Zhang\u2019s new work?\u201d\u201cZhang Ye also knows how to write prose?\u201d\u201cHow can\u2019t he? Wasn\u2019t \u2018The Song of the Stormy Petrel\u2019 a prose poem? It\u2019s about the same.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve seen it. It\u2019s really impressive. It indeed looks like it was written by Teacher Zhang Ye.\u201d\u201cAh, Teacher Zhang also forwarded it and gave it a like. It\u2019s definitely Teacher Zhang Ye\u2019s work!\u201d\u201cEveryone, quickly push it to the top. The next big work after \u2018Dead Water\u2019! Don\u2019t let it sink!\u201d\u201cAfter seeing \u2018Tribute to the White Poplar\u2019, my mind suddenly had these words, \u2018Tribute to Zhang Ye\u2019. What sort of talent is needed to create so many works worthy of being classics!?\u201d\u201cYou really saw him? What does Teacher Zhang look like? Is he handsome?\u201dThe language teacher replied, \u201cYou can\u2019t describe him with handsome, but I think his eyes are quite charming. Haha, my husband is coming home soon, so I\u2019ll delete this reply in a short while.\u201dThat afternoon, \u2018Tribute to the White Poplar\u2019 did not receive as many forwards or clicks as Zhang Ye\u2019s previous works, perhaps because it was more educative in nature. But many teachers and scholars who worked in education treated it as a treasure as they forwarded it and discussed about it. It did not draw in a large audience, but it was surprisingly well-acclaimed! This was Zhang Ye\u2019s only work that did not have much controversy. Those who had seen it did not have any doubts!* This is a popular Chinese slang in the form of \u201cYou\u2019re the one XXX! Your whole damned family XXX!\u201d. It came from \u201cMy Own Swordsman\u201d\u2019s character, Mo Xiaobei. The original text goes along the lines of someone saying to Mo Xiaobei, \u201cMo Xiaobei, you are a child who matured early!\u201d, before Mo Xiaobei replies \u201cYou\u2019re the one who is maturing early! Your whole damned family is maturing early!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 87": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I\u2019m Really a SuperstarCH 86Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 86: Little Zhang Seeks Employment!Today.Early in the morning, Zhang Ye lazed in his bed. He laid under his blanket while surfing the internet on his cellphone. The comments on his \u201cTribute to the White Poplar\u201d was ever increasing and it was all positive. He browsed through the comments before opening up the Celebrity Rankings website to take a look at his own ranking. The site was very well-organized. After all, it was the most authoritative ratings publisher with historical information and all results are clearly listed.Searching for \u201cZhang Ye\u201d.Day before yesterday\u2019s rating: E-List, ranking 1375.Yesterday\u2019s rating: E-List, ranking 1382.Today\u2019s rating: E-List, ranking 1375.Zhang Ye\u2019s previous world had many things that did not exist in this world. But this world also had many successful works which did not exist in his old world. There was no fair comparison as to which world was stronger. In fact, this world\u2019s professional ratings were very well-standardized. There was an especially large number of artistes, with very broad development and advancement routes. There was hardly any limitations to who you can become.For example, in this world, many stars started off as models. They developed within their industry to D-List celebrities or higher, before turning to acting in TV shows and films. In the end, they even managed to get very high achievements. Where Zhang Ye came from, it was a very different world. Models, authors or poets\u2026 It was very difficult to crossover from different industries. At the most, they could reach the pinnacle of their own field. Only a small minority could succeed when they transitioned from their own industry to a different one. The limitations were huge.This was something that Zhang Ye appreciated. Because with his level of a few radio broadcast shows and several poetry works, he would never have become a celebrity in his old world. This world had been unified in a way where no matter which industry you came from, as long as your results were exemplary, they would contribute to your celebrity ranking data. Even if you were a cab driver, as long as you attracted enough social attention through any means and managed to climb up the Celebrity Rankings Index, advertisers would still look for you. What matters most in this world is fame!Of course, if it were because of some hot topic which contributed to your fame, the data would take it into consideration and average out your rankings. Every factor would be carefully formulated, so that any viral topics would not attribute to an increase or decrease in rankings suddenly. The Celebrity Rankings website will also decrease rankings very quickly if a celebrity has not been producing any works that mattered.Then again, it could be exactly because of the open nature of such rankings that contributed to the scale of development here compared to Zhang Ye\u2019s previous world. The number of celebrities here were over ten times the amount of where he came from.Just looking at the E-List ranked celebrities, Zhang Ye was ranked at over 1000. Further below him, the lowest number was 1400+. Going further up the list to D, C, B and A, the total number of celebrities were too many. Not counting S-list and A-list celebrities, as those had much smaller numbers, the number of people who peaked were in the minorities.The entertainment industry\u2019s environment is not bad, but sigh, the competition was fierce, too. You win some, you lose some!1375?1382?Fell 7 ranks yesterday?Zhang Ye knew clearly that \u201cDead Water\u201d had brought him up into the E-List of rankings. But what goes up, usually comes down. There were still some fluctuations after the attention has faded. Yesterday was an exception. Even if \u201cGhost Blows Out the Light\u201d was still being broadcast, Zhang Ye\u2019s ranking dropped. Even though today\u2019s ranking rose again, he knew that it was due to the talk around \u201cTribute to the White Poplar\u201d. Although the sharing rate for it was not very high, the artistic nature of the prose was very important. It was important in the calculation of the rankings and likely to have had a big contributing rating in the statistics formulation. After all, the artistic values was something that could not be measure by fame. This had already been considered by the formulation.\u201cDead Water\u201d\u2019s trend had already died down.\u201cTribute to the White Poplar\u201d would only be trending for several more days.\u201cGhost Blows Out the Light\u201d would finish its broadcast run within half a month.Zhang Ye\u2019s pressure was extremely high. He also felt that he was in danger. He couldn\u2019t stay like this any longer. If he continued to stay home doing nothing, then his fame would fall sharply. What does an artiste depend on? They depend on continuous attention on themselves. Zhang Ye thought that if he had nothing else to show for, he would fall off from the E-List celebrity rankings in several days and go back to the role of a public figure again. He definitely did not want to see this happening. It hadn\u2019t been easy to achieve his fame and reputation. It had been very difficult in getting closer to his ambition, so he cannot just helplessly watch himself fall!Time to look for work!Target: Television stations!\u2014 This was the next target for Zhang Ye upon finishing his work at the radio station. He really wanted to be a television host to further develop himself. They had much larger audiences than at a lousy place like a radio station!Zhang Ye didn\u2019t laze around any longer. With an imminent taste of success, his spirits had been lifted and he began searching on a few job-seeking websites. After submitting a few resumes, he browsed over some of the television stations\u2019 official website recruitment pages. If there was a hosting position open, he would email them his resume. Even when there was no opening for the position, he didn\u2019t hesitate and emailed them all the same. He had to spread his fish net. It did not matter whether they were hiring or not. We will talk after the resume has been submitted!However, something that made Zhang Ye at a loss of whether to laugh or cry happened!20 minutes later, Tianjin Television Station was the first to reply to Zhang Ye\u2019s email. The email said, \u201cTeacher Zhang Ye, our temple is small. Therefore, we cannot afford to place such a strong deity like you here. Please look for another place.\u201d One look and he knew that they knew of him; they must have heard of \u201cDead Water\u201d.The second reply was from the Zhejiang Television Station. The email was written by the human resources department of the Zhejiang Television Station, \u201cWe\u2019re sorry, but we aren\u2019t hiring.\u201d However, Zhang Ye clearly saw that they had a job posting on their website which was to hire a variety program host.. and they were especially urgent!It was a job posting that was just posted!Great\u2026 When it reached me, you aren\u2019t hiring?Are all of you television stations banning me? That can\u2019t be necessary, right? I just said a few sentences to scold my unit and Leaders. I scolded the Beijing Radio Station, not all of you!Actually, Zhang Ye knew very clearly how big a mess he had stirred up at the awards ceremony, or he would not have submitted resumes himself without contacting Teacher Hu Fei, who had promised him earlier. He knew that no one in the industry would dare to hire him, especially the Beijing Television Station. From a point of view, they might not be the same team, but the Beijing Television Station and the Beijing Radio Station were practically two sides of the same coin, so Zhang Ye did not plan to give Hu Fei trouble. Although he knew, Zhang Ye still could not help but curse a few times while speaking to himself. All of you are less forgiving than a chicken!\u2026At the same time.Like Wind Recruitment Online, Shanghai headquarters.A staff member in charge of contacting companies about recruiting candidates was twiddling his thumbs. He was flipping through resumes half-heartedly. He wished to finish his work sooner, so that he could leave work early. However, when he clicked casually, he found Zhang Ye\u2019s resume posted on his company\u2019s website. Upon seeing it, he was astonished. A former Beijing Radio Station broadcaster? Created and also broadcast the current most famous supernatural novel, \u201cGhost Blows Out the Light\u201d? Wrote \u201cLittle Bunnies Be Good\u201d that was promoted by the Beijing Education Ministry? Posted modern poems online with more than a million clicks? And even received the most authoritative newcomer award in the broadcasting industry, the Silver Microphone Awards?He was a talent!This was a high-quality talent!He was shocked by the beautiful resume, and after checking on the internet, indeed, there was nothing fake about the resume; they were all Zhang Ye\u2019s achievements! Immediately, the staff member felt touched. Why would such an impressive person need to use our online recruitment website to look for a job? Which place wouldn\u2019t be fighting for you? But you still chose us? You trusted us this much? He immediately felt a great responsibility!He had to be worthy of the client\u2019s trust!He had to live to up the recognition from such a high-quality talent!He immediately turned diligent. He noticed that Zhang Ye wished to be a television station host and that he had no other position restrictions, which made him appreciate him even further. Look at him. He was fine with any position as a host. Variety, science, etc, he was not picky at all. Tsk, look at others. There were a bunch of those who had achievements similar to a fart. The last time, he had seen a person who was also looking for a hosting job. He was just a fresh graduate and had no experience at all. He demanded to be a variety show host, and needed a guarantee of his screen time after he received the position. He was so picky, and based on what?Look at Teacher Zhang Ye!Friendly! Low-key! Professional!Don\u2019t worry! Leave this job to me!The staff member logged onto the backend system and quickly found the data of seven or eight stations that were hiring hosts. He then called them one after another!\u201cHello, this is Like Wind Recruitment Online. I have a very qualified person here who wants to apply to be a host. When can you interview him?\u201d the staff member asked.The other side asked, \u201cDoes he have working experience?\u201dThe staff laughed, \u201cOf course, and his results are especially outstanding. You industry insiders should know. His name is Zhang Ye, and he has received this year\u2019s Silver Microphone Award.\u201d\u201cZhang Ye?\u201d The other side was dumbfounded.The staff chuckled, \u201cYes, yes, you know him, too, right? He trusts our site greatly and posted his resume to us. I think your television station is pretty good, so I chose first to recommend a person with such outstanding credentials to you. How about it? Interview tomorrow?\u201dThe other side was silent for a long time before saying, \u201cThen please leave this person with outstanding credentials for other television stations. Our station isn\u2019t that great, so we won\u2019t need him.\u201d\u201cAh? You don\u2019t want such an exceptional talent?\u201dAs he said that, all he heard was the sound of the other side hanging up.The staff was curious and called a second telephone number, followed by a third and a fourth. In the beginning, it was fine on the other side, as they appeared very thirsty for talent. But the moment that they heard him say the person was Zhang Ye, they all declined!Finally, when he made the sixth phone call, a television station staff member put on a long face as he said, \u201cBig Bro, can I call you Big Bro? This is the second time you are calling. I\u2019m in charge of both the hiring for the variety segments and the news segments. We were just on the phone before, so please spare me. I\u2019ll tell you the truth; if I were to agree to let Zhang Ye come for the interview, I can probably tell that I\u2019ll be interviewing at other places!\u201dThe Like Wind Recruitment staff was stunned, \u201cIs it that exaggerated? What\u2019s wrong with this person?\u201dThe television station staff gave a bitter smile, \u201cNothing much. He just had a war of words online with his colleague, cursed his unit with a poem at an award presentation ceremony, and caused a Leader to faint from anger!\u201dThe moment the staff heard this, he nearly vomited blood. He finally realized why Zhang Ye would submit his resume to a small website like theirs. It was not because he trusted them, but because no unit dared to hire him, so he had tried his luck with them!This wasn\u2019t some high-quality talent!It was clearly an extremely notorious hooligan!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

And from what I know, they have rejected him. No one wants him.\u201d\u201cAlright, I got it.\u201d Deputy Station Head Jia let his secretary leave. He knew that no one would dare hire Zhang Ye because both he and the Station Head had already informed friends in the industry. Although working in the radio station was not as glamorous as a television station, they still had quite a lot of connections. Maybe they might not be able to make other radio or television stations do anything to a person with excellent qualifications, but if they made the indication for someone whose qualifications were not good, then they could definitely let everyone in the industry reject that person!This was the so-called banning!The moment \u201cDead Water\u201d was out in the world, the Beijing Radio Station and Zhang Ye were irrevocably irreconcilable!\u2026An entire day.Zhang Ye did not receive anything. Every time he sent his resume, he would not even be given a chance at an interview. Their replies were very fast, for they rejected him without even giving him a look. It was impossible for them to not know him. A typical process of submitting a resume would need at least a few days before responding, even if they did not want him. Some even dragged it out for a month or two. But for Zhang Ye, it was different. It could be said to be a \u201csecond-level reply\u201d. Some people had responded politely, but others were not that polite. There were even e-mails that said \u201cwe want anybody but you\u201d!It\u2019s the end!The plans were up in smoke!Has this bro become public enemy number one?After trying a few more times to no avail, Zhang Ye was also out of options. Immediately, his temper turned bad. F**k it, were the television and radio industry collectively banning me? Fine, you think I can\u2019t live without you? Do you really think I need you to become famous?Zhang Ye immediately corrected his short-term plans. He definitely needed to join a television station, as it was a very important development and waypoint for his future. However, now with the situation changed, Zhang Ye had to make some temporary adjustments. He decided to put the television stations on hold, pushing forward some of his earlier plans, and waiting out the negative influence brought by \u201cDead Water\u201d. Since there was nothing to do these days, Zhang Ye would naturally not just sit idle, or his popularity would decrease by the day. He had to retain his popularity, as well as earn some money on the side.He called his previous assistant, Xiaofang from the radio station.Du Du, it was connected.\u201cHello, Xiaofang. This is your Brother Zhang.\u201d\u201cI know, Teacher Zhang, I have your number.\u201d\u201cHave you gotten off work?\u201d\u201cNot yet. I\u2019m adjusting some documents and will probably need to work overtime until eight.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s this. I came to you because of a matter. The last time, do you know about the matter of publishers contacting our radio station to publish my \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019? I didn\u2019t agree back then. The publishing firm had also skipped over me, or it could be said that the station management purposely prevented them from contacting me. Now, I\u2019m thinking of getting the publishing firm\u2019s telephone number. I have already left the unit, so it\u2019s not convenient for me to ask. Even if I asked, I wouldn\u2019t be able to get it. Can you check for me?\u201d\u201cAiyah, I also won\u2019t be able to find that out. I\u2019ll secretly ask others for you. I\u2019ll see if any colleagues know anything about this. You just need to know the publishing firm, right?\u201d\u201cYes, I just need to know the publishing firm.\u201d\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll do it immediately. Wait for my news.\u201d\u201cSorry for giving you trouble. Thank you. I\u2019ll treat you in the future.\u201dAfter putting down the cellphone, Zhang Ye lit up a cigarette and waited.After about twenty minutes, Xiaofang called back. She was very efficient, or it could be said that she was diligent with Zhang Ye\u2019s matters, \u201cHehe, Teacher Zhang, I got it for you. Get a notebook and write it down. The telephone number is 53276172. It\u2019s the Beijing Education Publishing Firm, one of the largest publishing firms in terms of sales in Beijing. Although they specialize in publishing some official books and works, they also do commercial books.\u201dZhang Ye wrote it down and said hurriedly, \u201cThank you very much.\u201dXiaofang whispered, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to thank me. Actually, it was Teacher Tian Bin who knew that you needed it before telling me. After all, he was always the anchor for \u2018Late-night Ghost Stories\u2019, so it was his responsibility to contact authors and publishers and knew this area well. Uh, but Teacher Tian Bin told me not to let you know this telephone number was given by him. I\u2019m just being frank with you, so don\u2019t betray me.\u201dZhang Ye was surprised, \u201cTian Bin? He was so nice? And didn\u2019t even want you to tell me?\u201d He and Tian Bin had previously had several quarrels and their feud was not tiny.Xiaofang sighed, \u201cAfter you left, Teacher Tian\u2019s days haven\u2019t been good. You might not know that yesterday, the station had already removed Teacher Tian from his anchor position of \u2018Late-night Ghost Stories\u2019, making him a replacement host. He has no position now.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Zhang Ye was curious, \u201cThat can\u2019t be; didn\u2019t he get the job after I was removed?\u201dXiaofang explained, \u201cIt\u2019s because of Jia Yan. Jia Yan\u2019s new segment, about 8-9 episodes of \u2018Soaring Youth\u2019 have been broadcasted already. Other than the first episode having an extremely high listenership rating, the episodes after decreased by the episode. It could only get that listenership rating for its first episode from the popularity of \u2018Old and Young Story Club\u2019, and it could not measure up to its previous usual standard.Now, with the program\u2019s defects exposed, yesterday\u2019s listenership rating was just 0.46%. I heard that it\u2019s about to be axed soon, so the higher-ups have transferred Jia Yan to \u2018Late-night Ghost Stories\u2019. Once \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019 is done broadcasting, Jia Yan will take over. After all, with tomb robbing-related supernatural novels being extremely popular these days, there are quite a lot of good works that are tailing behind you on the market. As long as we buy the copyright, we can use the popularity to increase the listenership ratings. The station is clearly paving the way for Jia Yan, letting him build up his qualifications. As for Teacher Tian\u2026 He naturally became the sacrificial lamb.\u201dZhang Ye frowned, \u201cOld Tian is so miserable now?\u201d\u201cHai, your \u2018Dead Water\u2019 did not wake them up. Now the station is getting even messier. Anyways, I heard that Teacher Tian has already submitted his resignation letter. He should be leaving in a day or two.\u201d Xiaofang said.The phone was hung up.Zhang Ye sat on the bed. Hearing a previous enemy of his in such a situation, he did not feel happy at all, and in fact felt very uncomfortable!Let\u2019s put this matter aside for a while.Zhang Ye called the number given to him by Tian Bin. It did not connect on the first time, as the other party might have been busy. It connected on the second try.\u201cHello, who\u2019s this?\u201d The other party was a middle-aged man.Zhang Ye said, \u201cHi! I\u2019m Zhang Ye, the original author of \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019. I heard your publishing firm wants to discuss about the publishing copyright? I\u2019m wondering if you still have those intentions?\u201dThe middle-aged man was stunned, \u201cYou are the author of \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019?\u201dZhang Ye laughed, \u201cHur Hur, that\u2019s me alright.\u201d\u201cEh, I thought you were not planning on selling your copyright?\u201d the middle-aged man curiously asked.Zhang Ye said, \u201cI never said so. You must have gotten that information from my unit, right? The unit did not inform me. They told you things I know nothing about. I have also resigned already.\u201dHearing this, the middle-aged man was very excited, \u201cAiyah, then that\u2019s great. We were still worried about how to get the rights to \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019, but your unit was unwilling to reveal anything. Now that we have gotten ahold of you, things can be expedited. Teacher Zhang Ye, I\u2019m the one who was in charge of this matter, so you can discuss about the copyright matters with me. Do you want to go the royalty route or a one-time buyout of the simplified Chinese edition copyright?\u201d\u201cWhat would be the prices?\u201d Zhang Ye asked.The middle-aged man said, \u201cIf it\u2019s royalties, then it will be normal, for we all use a standard rate. It will be based on a percentage of the sales received. If it\u2019s a buyout, we had offered two million to your radio station back then. Of course, that was back then. Now \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019 is causing a greater effect on the market, and the response is very hot. Many people are looking forward to a physical copy. Even a few tomb robbing books that imitate yours have sales of about 100,000 copies. Even if I don\u2019t tell you, I believe you will understand. Nor will I lie to you, as the evaluation of your work is definitely very high. Uh, let\u2019s do this. I\u2019ll make the decision, and not decide based on the word count. I\u2019ll offer four million. We only want the copyright to the simplified Chinese edition. The rest of the copyright belongs to you; how about it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a bit low, right?\u201d Zhang Ye\u2019s tone sounded unsatisfied, but he was actually overjoyed in his heart. Baby, four million? This was enough to buy him so many instant noodles!However, upon further thought, it was actually not a lot. In his world, \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019 had gone mad. He did not know how much the author had received, but it was definitely more than four million.The middle-aged man paused, \u201cTeacher Zhang, I\u2019m not sure how much you want, but please believe me. Only our Beijing Education Publishing Firm will be willing to buy the copyright of one book with four million. It happens that we have good cash flow this year. If it were other publishing firms, none of them would dare make such a bet, for if the sales aren\u2019t good\u2026\u201dZhang Ye interrupted, \u201cCan\u2019t you already estimate the sales volume? If the works that imitate mine already have such sales, the sales of mine would definitely be higher than theirs by a lot more once \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019 comes out! I believe you know the market better than me.\u201dThe middle-aged man said, \u201cBut your program has been broadcast on radio, and many have already heard it, so it might cause some detrimental effect to the sales.\u201dNonsense. \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019 was first posted online in his world. And weren\u2019t there quite a number of people who had read it? Yet, I didn\u2019t see it having low sales when it was published!After more bargaining.Zhang Ye requested for six million.The other side was only willing to give 4.8 million, having added a bit more.After the bargaining could not carry on, the middle-aged man pondered and said, \u201cAlright, Teacher Zhang, we can do six million, too, but you will have to give the publishing rights of \u2018Little Bunnies Be Good\u2019, \u2018Snow White and the Seven Dwarves\u2019, \u2018The Emperor\u2019s New Clothes\u2019 and \u2018The Wizard of Oz\u2019 to us. We are an education publisher firm, so that is our core business. We can include some illustrations and sell them as small books. With all that added up, six million!\u201d Clearly, they knew Zhang Ye well and had done their homework on his fairy tales. They knew the value of those stories!\u201cThe fairy tales do not include the overseas copyright, right?\u201d\u201cMan, no it does not. Only the domestic simplified edition. As for publishing overseas\u2026 We don\u2019t have that ability, either.\u201d The middle-aged man felt that Zhang Ye was very ambitious. Was he already thinking of selling the fairy tales overseas?Zhang Ye did some calculations and felt that the price was right, \u201cAlright, then.\u201d\u201cGreat! Since we are in a rush for time, shall we meet now? And sign the contract?\u201d The middle-aged man said, \u201cI am also a loyal listener of \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019. I can tell that this novel will end in a few more episodes, so once we sign the contract, we can send a lawyer\u2019s letter to the Beijing Radio Station to stop the broadcast of \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019. The audio edition copyright is still in your hands, right?\u201d\u201cYes, all the copyright is with me.\u201d Zhang Ye said.\u201cThen, that\u2019s great. If the radio station finishes broadcasting it, then there is no suspense. It will definitely affect the sales. Since you have already resigned, I believe you have no qualms about stopping the broadcast?\u201d\u201cOf course not. You can do it for me.\u201d\u201cAlright, leave this to us. I\u2019ll immediately draw up the contract!\u201dHaving negotiated successfully, both sides were overjoyed.Actually, the price received for selling \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019 was not that high. It could be said to be acceptable, at best. However, Zhang Ye knew that in his world, the legendary sales of \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019 were not created in a short period of time, but over a long process. One year, two years, three years, they were accumulated sales figures. And the publishing firm had bought it out with six million at once. After inflation and other factors, Zhang Ye did not lose out at all, and it was just the simplified Chinese edition. It did not include the copyrights to games or movies, so he was very pleased.The contract was signed.Details and the promotion were discussed.\u2026The morning of the second day.Deputy Station Head Jia had just arrived at the radio station. But before he could enter his office, his secretary came rushing over. \u201cStation Head Jia, we have a situation. The Beijing Education Publishing Firm has sent us a lawyer\u2019s letter, requesting that we immediately stop broadcasting \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019, or they will sue us for infringement!\u201d\u201cInfringement?\u201d Deputy Station Head Jia said angrily, \u201cWhat copyright has our program infringed on!?\u201dThe secretary gave a wry smile, \u201cBut, but the novel was written by Zhang Ye. He never gave us the copyright. Now, the lawyer\u2019s letter is with the Station Head. I heard that it even has Zhang Ye\u2019s signature.\u201dDeputy Station Head Jia\u2019s anger surged, \u201cWhat is this Little Zhang doing? Eh? How can he stop the broadcast after it had been broadcast for so long? How are we to answer to the listeners?\u201dThe secretary sighed, \u201cBut legally, we are indeed\u2026\u201dThe phone in the office rang, Deputy Station Head Jia quickly went forward to pick it up, \u201cHello. Oh, Station Head\u2026 What? Stop the broadcast? How are we to stop! The story isn\u2019t over yet\u2026 But\u2026 Alright, I understand. I will instruct the Literature Channel\u2026 Rest assured.\u201dThe station did not want to lose money in a court case. The Station Head had compromised!Deputy Station Head Jia was gritting his teeth with hate. This Zhang Ye! He was gone, but he was still around haunting them?Admittedly, they had caused a ban on Zhang Ye and Deputy Station Head Jia had naively thought that Zhang Ye would never have a platform of his own forever, existing silently. With such a major \u201cban order\u201d, what waves could he set off without a program? But Deputy Station Head Jia now realized something. They could suppress Zhang Ye in the broadcasting industry, but they had no say in other industries!The publication world?They could not ban him even if they wanted to!And Zhang Ye was not a person with only broadcasting abilities! He also had his creations! And those novels and fairy tales! Despite Zhang Ye leaving the broadcasting industry, Deputy Station Head Jia realized to his anger that Zhang Ye could still thrive! This made him extremely angry, but he was helpless!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 89": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I\u2019m Really a SuperstarCH 88Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 88: The Competition for the Rights to Ghost Blows Out the LightTwo days later.The news of the publication of \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019 was spread like wildfire.When Zhang Ye opened a few large discussion boards, three of the boards had the advertisement banners for \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019 on the main page. \u201cThe original ancestor of Grave Robbing Novels, \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019, will be released on the 1st of October at all major bookstores.\u201dToday was already the 29th.It was about to go on sale in less than two days.Zhang Ye had also asked the middle-aged man from the publication firm why it could be done so quickly. His reply made Zhang Ye speechless. He had said that back then, their publication firm had already agreed with the Beijing Radio Station a long time ago. They had even readied the contracts, as well as all the preparations for the promotions and sales printing planned.Everything was just waiting for the green light. However, there was complete silence from the radio station, which was because Zhang Ye did not agree to Deputy Station Head Jia acquiring his rights. Hence, all the printing and promotional plans were put on hold. Now, having finally received the rights to \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019, they just needed to bring forward their plans from before. This resulted in a very fast procedure, and was unlike other publications which could take months.Of course, the most important thing was that the Beijing Education Publishing Firm was also in a hurry. Six million Yuan (1,000,000 USD) was not a small amount. The situation with the fairy tales was better, for there were no similar fairy tales that tried to compete with Zhang Ye\u2019s. However, \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019 was not the same. As it was not published immediately, this resulted in a large number of works that chased the tailwind and left it behind, being published first. If this dragged on, the situation would be hard to tell. If the grave robbing novel market was oversaturated, then their publishing firm would be unable to regain their initial investment. This was what they were worrying about. Hence, the moment that they received the copyright, they had rushed to ensure things would go smoothly. Clearly, they were more worried than the author himself.It was good that the publishing firm was very diligent.As a result, Zhang Ye did not worry over it. Since his copyright had been bought out, he was no longer worried about the situation with the sales. He remained at home, watching the television without any worries.Ring, ring, ring. A phone call came in.Seeing that it was an unfamiliar number, Zhang Ye picked it up, \u201cHello.\u201d\u201cHello, may I know if this is Teacher Zhang Ye?\u201d It was a female\u2019s voice.\u201cThat\u2019s me; may I know who this is?\u201d Zhang Ye asked.The woman smiled sweetly, \u201cI\u2019m calling from the Hebei province\u2019s radio copyright department. It\u2019s this; I heard that the Beijing Radio Station has halted broadcasting for two days. Later on, there was the promotion of the publication of \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019. Are you trying to preserve the sales volume, so you halted the broadcast of \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019? I want to ask how many audio episodes left are there in \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019? Is it convenient to tell me?\u201dZhang Ye said, \u201cThere\u2019s probably another 10+ more episodes.\u201dThe woman said, \u201cThen, will it be possible to sell the audio rights of the last 10+ episodes to my radio station? The price is negotiable. Shall we meet to discuss the details?\u201dZhang Ye understood what was happening and said, \u201cThere\u2019s no need. Before the publication of \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019, the audio version will definitely not be broadcast. I have already discussed this with the publishers.\u201dThe woman said determinedly, \u201cNo problem; we can wait. \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019 should be published in 5-6 books consecutively, right? After the last book is done, our radio station will publish it. Price-wise, we can give you 100,000 in copyright fees, as there\u2019s not that many episodes. Uh, what do you think?\u201d\u201cForget it.\u201d Zhang Ye shook his head.\u201cIf you think the price is too low, we can still discuss it.\u201d The woman was unwilling to hang up.\u201cThank you, but I\u2019m not selling it for the time being.\u201d Zhang Ye hung up the phone.But not long after, a few more phone calls came in. It was unknown which publisher or other circles had revealed his contact information. This resulted in various provincial radio stations calling him to buy the audio rights to \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019. They did not quote a low price, and were willing to wait until the publication was out before releasing the audio version, paving the way for the hardcopy. What was most hilarious was that even someone from the Beijing Radio Station came looking for Zhang Ye.\u201cTeacher Zhang, I\u2019m Little Li from logistics.\u201d The youth said, \u201cWe once met in the elevator and exchanged a few words. Do you still remember?\u201dZhang Ye naturally did not remember, but he said, \u201cOh. Little Li, I remember you.\u201dThe youth sighed before saying, \u201cThe higher-ups told me to discuss the rights to \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019 with you. I know that you have had some conflicts with the station previously, but even so, \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019 is your program, your child. It was brought up by you and your novel is already well-rooted in our radio station. The audience recognizes this brand. With this halt, many listeners are calling it quits. Our official website has received a few denial of service attacks. I believe that you also do not want to see this situation. The audience is wishing for \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019 to resume its broadcast.\u201dUpon hearing this, Zhang Ye sneered, \u201cYes, that is not something I want to see, but I did not leave willingly. Everything has a solution, but your station\u2019s management did not leave a route for me to live. I also wish to see \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019 finish its broadcast, with a beginning and an end, but I have no choice.You don\u2019t have to say nice words to me, nor use the audience to try to influence me. Those listeners who like my novel can buy the book to \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019. Those who like listening to a broadcast and audio version can hear it on a radio station after the last volume of \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019 is published, but I can guarantee you this\u2026 It will definitely not be on Beijing Radio Station!\u201dHe immediately hung up. He did not say anything unnecessary!Zhang Ye found it amusing. You were the ones forcing me away, and now you are keeping a straight face to get my permission and rights? How big is your face?As for the other radio stations, they had definitely been given the order to ban Zhang Ye. Although Zhang Ye had not submitted his resume to the radio stations, it was obvious that no one would accept him even if he applied. But now? After banning me, you still want my rights? You want to get all the advantages?Not selling!Zhang Ye had rejected them all!However, with careful thought, if other radio stations, including the Beijing Radio Station, were dying to buy the rights to \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019, and furthermore a \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019 with just 10+ episodes left, this showed that many people in the industry thought highly of the novel. It could also be said that the industry knew how exceptional \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019 was.Zhang Ye had used a single \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019 to break the late-night segment listenership ratings records! Number one in the country for that time period! The creator of the midnight period historical record in the whole country! Even the Central Radio Station\u2019s late-night segment was not enough to defeat Zhang Ye! What sort of legend was this? Probably most colleagues in the radio station knew that having \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019 meant having such listenership ratings!Even if there were just 10+ episodes left, even if it was less than ten episodes, even if it was a late-night segment, \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019 was \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019. It was not something other late-night segments could compete with! Hence, they had rushed to buy the rights. Even the Beijing Radio Station had straightened their faces before approaching!Not long later, the phone rang again.Zhang Ye was prepared not to pick it up, as he knew it could be someone from the radio station. However, when he saw the number, he gave a wry smile. He had to pick it up.\u201cHello, Little Zhang.\u201d It was Beijing Radio Station\u2019s Literature Channel\u2019s Director Zhao Guozhou, \u201cWhat are you doing? Why did you take so long to pick up the phone? Hur Hur, you can\u2019t still be sleeping, right?\u201dZhang Ye coughed, \u201cNo, Director Zhao. I woke up earlier on. I had been on the phone for an hour.\u201dZhao Guozhou understood, \u201cThey were all looking for you to buy your audio, right?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Zhang Ye said, \u201cYou can even guess it?\u201dZhao Guozhou said lightly, \u201cI wasn\u2019t guessing. I knew it. I called you because of this matter. Just now, you rejected someone from logistics, right? The higher-ups aren\u2019t willing to let go of \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019, so they got me to look for you. They also know that you and the station\u2019s management are as unmixable as oil and water, so they got me to discuss the price with you. It is a market economy after all, so they wish to use money to talk.\u201dZhang Ye was about to speak, \u201cLeader, I\u2026\u201dZhao Guozhou laughed, \u201cListen to me first. I already know, even without you telling me. They do not understand you, but I believe I know this kid that is you. If you were willing to swallow insult and humiliation for money to sell \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019 back to us, then you wouldn\u2019t be called Zhang Ye. You would also not have said that \u2018Dead Water\u2019 in front of so many people.They clearly think too simply of you. So I have no intentions of persuading you to sell the rights. I only called to ask about your situation. Seeing your publication promotions doing so well, I\u2019m also well-assured. After all, you were brought in by me. I deserve to be faulted for not being able to protect you.\u201d\u201cDirector Zhao, what are you saying?\u201d Zhang Ye was not willing to hear this, \u201cHow can you blame yourself. Every injustice has its perpetrator, and every debt has its debtor. I know this clearly.\u201d After pausing for a while, he said, \u201cActually I already told Little Li from logistics that I would sell the rights to anyone but the Beijing Radio Station. But.. if you were to say it, you can take the rights away. I won\u2019t want a single cent. Once the last book is released on the market, you can carry on broadcasting it on the Literature Channel!\u201dZhao Guozhou remained silent for a while. Zhang Ye\u2019s words had touched him. Speaking truthfully, Zhao Guozhou had only brought Zhang Ye in. He did not help much. But even so, Zhang Ye was still a loyal person and remembered their old friendship. Back when Zhang Ye said to Zhao Guozhou that he would show his gratitude by repaying him, these were clearly not just empty words. He would really do it!But Zhao Guozhou was not willing to accept it!He was not a person without a sense of propriety!\u201cLittle Zhang, just those words alone are sufficient. Alright, I didn\u2019t make a mistake in my judgment with you.\u201d Zhao Guozhou assured him, \u201cYou can sell the audio rights to anyone but us. I have already received the news that if we were to obtain the rights to \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019, it would end up with Jia Yan broadcasting it. The 10+ episodes that you had recorded would be deleted, and Jia Yan would be re-recording it. The station is using all its resources to raise him up.\u201d\u201cI got it. Thank you, Director Zhao.\u201d Zhang Ye suddenly recalled, \u201cBy the way, what happened to Tian Bin? I heard that he was removed from his segment?\u201d\u201cWhy are you suddenly concerned about Little Tian?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just casually asking.\u201d\u201cLittle Tian has already resigned. He left the day before yesterday. He should be at home, waiting to get a job. I heard that his situation isn\u2019t very good. No radio station wants him, as he lacks experience and results. Hai, actually with the two of you fighting so much, and causing all the suffering between each other all this time, in the end, it benefited another person.\u201d\u201cCan you give me Tian Bin\u2019s number? I did not store his number.\u201d\u201cWhat are you looking for him for? Forget it, I won\u2019t ask. I\u2019ll send it to you in a moment.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He called Tian Bin using the number listed. When the other side picked up, he immediately said, \u201cTeacher Tian, it\u2019s me.\u201dBut it was a woman who answered back, \u201cYou? Who?\u201dZhang Ye mumbled and recognized her voice, \u201cSis, it\u2019s me, Zhang Ye.\u201d\u201cWhich Zhang Ye?\u201d Tian Bin\u2019s wife asked knowingly. She added, \u201cOld Tian is not around!\u201dJust when she was about to hang up, Tian Bin\u2019s voice rang out, \u201cWhat are you doing? Give the phone to me.\u201dTian Bin definitely had Zhang Ye\u2019s phone number stored. Presumably, his wife had seen Zhang Ye\u2019s name when he called and answered it. Tian Bin\u2019s wife was heard in the background, nagging, \u201cWhy did you answer? That Zhang Ye fella must have called to make fun of you. How long have you two been fighting, and you still wanna answer? Yes, both of you have left your jobs already, but you were forced out. As for Zhang Ye, he might have looked like he was forced by the circumstances, but you know that he resigned on his own terms. He left the station with pride. Look at the success of \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019; it\u2019s even going to be published soon. Tsk! What else could he be planning by calling you now! He definitely wants to step on you while you are down! Why are you even answering!\u201d\u201cI want you to give me that!\u201d Tian Bin turned furious.\u201cI\u2019ll give, I\u2019ll give, I\u2019ll give! I won\u2019t bother about you anymore!\u201d Tian Bin\u2019s wife was frustrated as well.Their conversation had been clearly heard by Zhang Ye and it made him a little intolerable. He knew that this call of his was made at the wrong time. He could tell that Tian Bin had not had it easy for the past few days. He had lost his job and still couldn\u2019t find a new one yet. As the saying goes, in peaceful times, everything is fine. And it was the same the other way round; a poor couple, a lifetime of misery. The two of them must have had countless arguments in recent days.\u201cHello.\u201d Tian Bin answered. His voice was a little cold, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dZhang Ye hesitated a little, but went ahead, \u201cTeacher Tian, thanks for the other day.\u201dTian Bin played the fool, \u201cWhich matter from what day?\u201d\u201cThe publisher\u2019s number.\u201d Zhang Ye reminded him.Tian Bin frowned, \u201cThat Xiaofang, I repeatedly instructed her not to say that it was me. Forget it. You don\u2019t need to thank me; it was not a big matter.\u201d\u201cHave you had dinner?\u201d\u201cNot yet.\u201d\u201cCome out and join me then?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not necessary. If there\u2019s nothing else, I\u2019m hanging up.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be like this. Old Tian, come out and have dinner. We have been fighting for so long. I stole your show, you stole my show. We also argued and left our posts at about the same time. Isn\u2019t this some sort of fate? Just accept my invitation. Let\u2019s decide on that place called something-something pavilion near the unit, where we had the celebratory lunch the other time. I will be there in 30 minutes. Bring your wife along. See you there!\u201cNo need for that!\u201d\u201cI have something to tell you; we need to talk over dinner!\u201dAfter saying that, Zhang Ye hung up without explaining further. He packed up, combed his hair and then left for the place by subway.After reaching the vicinity of the restaurant, he didn\u2019t know whether Tian Bin would show up. He had arrived slightly early and went to a copier shop. He used the public computers and signed into his email account. After downloading the copyright contract that he had received when he was still at the unit, he changed a few of the names and let the staff print it out for him. He asked for a pen and signed off on the contract before placing it into his briefcase. He then left for the restaurant, greeted a waiter and asked for a room to wait for Tian Bin\u2019s arrival.After about 10 minutes.Tian Bin and his wife had arrived late. The waiter had led them to Zhang Ye\u2019s reserved room.When Zhang Ye saw Tian Bin, he was stunned. It was as if he didn\u2019t know him anymore, because the changes were too much. In the past, he was much more handsome. But now he looked a little dirty, with hair stubble on his face. It was obvious that he had not shaved in a few days. Even though his hair was washed, it was still rather messy and not groomed. His fallen spirit was apparent without him saying anything. It was written all over his forehead. Tian Bin\u2019s wife still looked quite refreshed. She still dressed like her usual pretty self.\u201cWould you like to order?\u201d the waiter asked.\u201cYou have not ordered? Then, I will order.\u201d Tian Bin\u2019s wife did not stand on ceremony. The moment that she sat down, she began ordering everything that was expensive on the menu, \u201cSharks\u2019 Fin Soup, Dongpo Pork, Abalone for three\u2026..\u201dTian Bin stared at her, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dTian Bin\u2019s wife said \u201cIt\u2019s his treat, anyway.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t say it was my treat, Sister.\u201d Zhang Ye hastily said.Tian Bin\u2019s wife eyes looked like they were popping out, \u201cIf you weren\u2019t treating, why did you ask us out? Why are you picking on us! Your book will be published soon! If a single volume of the book sells below 500,000 units, I will twist my head off for you. You are so rich now and yet you want to save on this meal?\u201dZhang Ye wiped his sweat, \u201cBig sister, my money has not been transferred over yet. The publisher hasn\u2019t paid me yet.\u201d\u201cStill, it should be your treat.\u201d Tian Bin\u2019s wife said to the waiter, \u201cDid you write down what I ordered just now? Listen, continue to take the order. Steamed sea bass, a roast duck\u2026 I want it to be freshly roasted, and the most expensive type. Don\u2019t cut back on the quality. Okay, that\u2019s all for now.\u201dZhang Ye added on, \u201cServe us some Wuliangye as well!\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d The waiter proceeded to prepare the order.Maybe because it was past lunchtime and there weren\u2019t many guests. The food was served quickly.\u201cHere, Old Tian, Sister. Eat, eat.\u201d Zhang Ye said politely.Tian Bin did not move his chopsticks. The wine had been brought over, so he twisted it open and poured a full cup for himself. He then passed it to Zhang Ye, \u201cPour some for yourself.\u201d\u201cSure, let\u2019s have a drink together.\u201d Zhang Ye poured some for himself.Tian Bin\u2019s wife kept glancing at them, \u201cThis should be a good wine; I will have some, too.\u201d\u201cWhat are you drinking for?\u201d Tian Bin was unhappy.Tian Bin\u2019s wife had been speaking with sarcasm since the moment she had entered the restaurant, \u201cOnly you can drink and I cannot? I\u2019m not in a good mood; can\u2019t I have a glass?\u201d\u201cDrink, drink, drink. Who cares about you?\u201d Tian Bin then took a mouthful.They had nothing to talk about. They were foes to begin with, so the atmosphere was rather awkward. Besides eating, they were drinking. No one tried to say anything more.Finally, it was alcohol that worked its magic.Tian Bin suddenly said something. He looked at Zhang Ye and laughed, \u201cWhat do you think about our feud? What were we fighting for? Look at it now. You have left, and I have also left. In the end, it was that Jia Yan who took our places. Don\u2019t you think that we were stupid?\u201dZhang Ye replied, \u201cYes, we were really dumb.\u201dTian Bin might have had a little too much, and he began to talk much more, too, \u201cForget it; let\u2019s not talk about the past. If there\u2019s anything that I did wrong in the past, let this big brother apologize to you. Come, cheers.\u201dZhang Ye stopped him, \u201cStop right there; we have to be clear here. It should be me apologizing. I am younger and more hot headed, and I did not think before I spoke\u2026..\u201dTian Bin interrupted him, \u201cLet\u2019s shut up and drink!\u201dZhang Ye heartily said, \u201cGood; let\u2019s drink!\u201dZhang Ye did not hold his alcohol well; he was the type who collapsed after a glass. After a few mouthfuls, he did not dare to raise his glass anymore. Instead, he talked about a more serious topic, \u201cOld Tian, how\u2019s the job search?\u201dTian Bin sighed, \u201cThere\u2019s been nothing yet. The radio stations are currently not understaffed. In fact, there are over-staffing issues; they are firing rather than hiring. There aren\u2019t many positions. I\u2019m not like you; even though I have several years\u2019 of experience, I still have no results to show for them. Hur, I can only stay home; I\u2019m even prepared to switch careers.\u201dTian Bin\u2019s wife shouted, \u201cDon\u2019t talk rubbish. What do you mean by switching careers!?\u201d\u201cIf I don\u2019t make a switch, what can I do? There\u2019re no positions available!\u201d Tian Bin said worriedly, \u201cI love my radio broadcast job, but it doesn\u2019t f**king love me back!\u201dTian Bin\u2019s wife relented, \u201cThere will be chances; try again.\u201d\u201cHow many times have I tried already? I\u2019ve even asked the outer provinces and there\u2019re no suitable positions for me. In truth, it\u2019s just because they don\u2019t want me, because I\u2019m not good enough!\u201d Tian Bin mourned.\u201cYou have so much experience; I don\u2019t believe that no one wants you.\u201d Tian Bin\u2019s wife said.Zhang Ye pondered for a bit and took his bag out. From it, he pulled out several documents and placed it squarely on the table. He pushed it over to Tian Bin, \u201cOld Tian, take a look at this.\u201d\u201cWhat is that?\u201d\u201cTake a look first.\u201dTian Bin read it while his wife glanced at it from his side. And soon, their faces were in shock, \u201cThis is.. the contract for the audio rights to \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019?\u201dZhang Ye nodded, \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the meaning of this?\u201d Tian Bin was confused.Zhang Ye explained \u201cThe contract is a general one. The terms are nothing too special. A radio station would use this kind of contract for copyright purchasing. I actually took it from another station and had it changed. The title is \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019. At the bottom is my signature to release the copyright. I\u2019ve had everything filled out already, except for the beneficiary. From here, take this contract with you when you go for your interviews. Bring the story with you and it will be you choosing your employer, not the other way around. Old Tian, I am handing the radio broadcast of \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019 to you. It is like my child, so please don\u2019t mistreat it.\u201dTian Bin was stunned, \u201cBut you\u2026..\u201dTian Bin\u2019s wife said with her mouth agape, \u201cCan this work out? With this copyright, everyone will be snatching for Old Tian?\u201d\u201cWhy is that not possible!\u201d Tian Bin said agitatedly, \u201cDo you know how many radio stations are fighting for the rights to \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019? They are all fighting their heads off for it!\u201dZhang Ye said, \u201cYes. Just today, there were 8-9 stations who called me, but I did not sell it.\u201d\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you sell it?\u201d Tian Bin asked.Zhang Ye fiddled with his hands and spoke honestly, \u201cActually, I don\u2019t know why either. Maybe I just want to help out an old colleague. After fighting for so long, I do not wish the worst for you. Old Tian, you have to do well. We still have to continue our rivalry in the future. Don\u2019t fall here without a fight. Haha, otherwise who can I cuss at next time?\u201dTian Bin\u2019s eyes were a little red; he knew how important the contract was. He grasped the pieces of paper in his hands and went silent. He did not say any dismissive, nor gratuitous, words, but he looked deeply at Zhang Ye and nodded, \u201cDo not worry; I will not fall like this!\u201dTian Bin\u2019s wife excitedly cried out, \u201cLittle Zhang, you\u2026 Tell me how we can ever repay you. You have helped Old Tian out big time. Aiyo, and to think this Sister treated you in that manner just now. Please don\u2019t hold it against a little woman like me.\u201dZhang Ye did not mind, \u201cSister, your words just now, I have already encountered them on my first day at work when you spoke down on me with Old Tian here. Hur Hur, if you don\u2019t talk down on me, I will not feel comfortable!\u201dTian Bin\u2019s wife was red with embarrassment, \u201cWhen did I talk down on you?\u201d\u201cYou did.\u201d Tian Bin replied and then had a laugh himself.\u201cAlright, then Sister will atone for it with a drink!\u201d Tian Bin\u2019s wife mood had also turned for the better.No discord, no concord. Some relationships in this world were just so marvelous!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Not yet? I already told you not to quit. Take a look, take a look!\u201dZhang Ye simply rinsed his mouth and wiped his mouth as he laughed, \u201cMom, even if I don\u2019t have a job now, I will also not starve to death. Don\u2019t you know? My \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019 and a few fairy tales are about to be published. Today happens to be the day it goes on sale, so you don\u2019t have to worry about me. When the publishing firm transfers me the money, I\u2019ll give you some.\u201dMom was overjoyed, \u201cIt\u2019s published already? How much did you make?\u201dZhang Ye feigned ignorance, \u201cNot much, not much. Have you eaten?\u201d\u201cI asked you how much, so stop trying to interrupt!\u201d Mom said fiercely.Zhang Ye could only say, \u201cAbout six million. After it reaches me, it\u2019s probably around five million. Quite a lot of it is taxed.\u201d\u201cWhat? Six million? Aiyah! Hey!\u201d Mom was shocked, \u201cDid you rob a bank? So much? Aren\u2019t most people earning only a few tens of thousands when they publish a book? Our neighbor Uncle Zhang\u2019s child is also an author. His best book only received 80,000. Why is yours so much more?\u201dZhang Ye began bragging, \u201cHow can that be the same. What kind of book is my \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019? It\u2019s completely on a different level when compared to theirs. Also, I have my fairy tales. All of them are classics. I even think I lost out. If not for them giving me the money quickly, and that they only wanted the simplified Chinese rights, I wouldn\u2019t have sold for this pittance. Mom, help me tell Dad. Don\u2019t let him be worried for me. I\u2019m doing fine. After quitting my job at the radio station, I actually have more freedom. If I want to publish, I can publish. I don\u2019t have to be limited by my job\u2019s regulations. Besides, I can guarantee you that there will be even better units waiting for me in the future.\u201d\u201cThen are you going to your granny\u2019s house today?\u201d\u201cGo with Dad; I won\u2019t be joining for now.\u201d\u201cAlright then. I know you are busy. Then do well.\u201dJust as the phone was about to be hung up, he even heard her Mom say to his Dad, \u201cGood lad, our son is impressive. Six million! He earned six million from publishing!\u201dOnly then did the call hang up. Tian Bin\u2019s number came calling.\u201cHello, Zhang Ye.\u201d Tian Bin\u2019s voice sounded excited.\u201cOld Tian, it\u2019s me. What\u2019s the matter?\u201d Zhang Ye walked out of the bathroom.Tian Bin said, \u201cI\u2019ve been hired. Yesterday, I submitted my resume and came for an interview today. In the end, after just five minutes of interviewing, they informed me that I would start work tomorrow.\u201d\u201cHey, that\u2019s good. Which radio station?\u201d Zhang Ye asked.Tian Bin laughed, \u201cIt\u2019s the Central Radio Station, the biggest radio institution in the country!\u201dZhang Ye was also happy for him, \u201cAlright, then I\u2019ll congratulate you first.\u201dTian Bin paused for a while, \u201cActually, it was all thanks to your copyright power of attorney. When I gave it to them during the interview, they were all speechless. Then a Leader made a phone call and came back, telling me to report to work tomorrow. It looks like the Central Radio Station also highly values your segment. Zhang Ye, thank you!\u201dZhang Ye laughed, \u201cI won\u2019t be able to get used to you being so polite, so there\u2019s no need to thank me. It\u2019s not a big deal; it\u2019s as simple as lifting a finger.\u201d\u201cIf we have the chance, let\u2019s have a meal.\u201d Tian Bin said.\u201cAlright, then we can have it when there\u2019s time.\u201d Zhang Ye hung up.After the two phone calls, Zhang Ye appeared happy. He had reported the good news to his mother and had congratulated Tian Bin; however, he was still feeling worried. Now with the publishing matter settled, this step had ended early, but his next step returned to that dead end once again, which was the way to get into a television station.If he was really banned and couldn\u2019t enter one, Zhang Ye would have to redevelop his plans. Where should he go? Filming movies? Singing? But the timing was not right. He still did not have the qualifications or ability to make people ignore his looks. If he were to encroach into the music and film industry straight away, probably no one would care about him. So what if the works he produced were great? The time was not ripe.Let\u2019s give an example.Was \u201cMiss Dong\u201d a good song?Back when the original songwriter released his album, almost no one heard it, nor did anyone know about it. Later, when it was sang by\u00a0Zuo Li\u00a0on the singing contest stage of Singing Boy did it become popular. It even went viral throughout the entire country. What was the reason? Although the lyrics were slightly changed, it was essentially the same song. There was no difference. Maybe his singing ability was slightly better than the original songwriter, but why did it only become popular when it was sung by Zuo Li and not him? It was not a problem with the song. The song was just a song, and it was also a good song. It was due to a fortuitous turn of events and also because of Zuo Li\u2019s story about his girlfriend. And a lot more of it had to do with looks and conditional factors. At least that was how Zhang Ye saw it. This was something he could do nothing about, for Zhang Ye knew that he was in a similar situation.Without the opportunity, he could not do something at the wrong time!He could only go to the television station. No matter how much thought he gave, that was the only place suitable for his next step to develop further. He needed a springboard, and he needed it a lot!No!Still can\u2019t give up on this!Zhang Ye decided to submit a few more resumes to give it a try. People did not want him the past few days, but it did not mean they it would not work now. He had already published \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019 and the promotional work done by the publisher firm was done very well. This had also added Reputation and popularity to Zhang Ye. The effects of \u201cDead Water\u201d had also decreased after a few days, so the television and radio stations could not ban him for life. There was a period, and once that period expired, Zhang Ye would naturally be able to appear.One resume!Three resumes!Five resumes!Zhang Ye began submitting resumes once again. There were only those few television stations that had a hosting position, so naturally he still submitted to them again.However, the response poured cold water on Zhang Ye again!The few television stations still responded very quickly. It was just like two days ago. The answer was still no!Zhang Ye felt that his head hurt and also felt dispirited. Your sister, how long must I have to wait? If this drags on, this bro will really drop off from being a E-list celebrity!Just as he was thinking, the third phone call of the day came.Zhang Ye was shocked, for the number was from the famous Program Producer who had previously invited him and had also job-hopped to the Beijing Television Station, Teacher Hu Fei!\u201cHello, Teacher Hu.\u201d Zhang Ye was not very sure why he had called.Hu Fei\u2019s tone was not very pleasant, \u201cTeacher Zhang, I heard you have been submitting your resume to a few television stations the past few days? Applying to be a host for them?\u201dZhang Ye coughed, \u201cYes, I was thinking of trying my luck.\u201dHu Fei said, \u201cDidn\u2019t I already invite you? And you had previously agreed, so why are you submitting resumes to other television stations?\u201dZhang Ye was stunned, \u201cAh? Teacher Hu, isn\u2019t the Beijing Television Station banning me? After all, I said that poem at the award presentation ceremony, and since the Beijing Radio Station and the Beijing Television Station are one, I knew what I should do. So I didn\u2019t have the nerve to bother you and make things hard on you.\u201dHu Fei was enlightened, \u201cSo you applied to other television stations, but did not submit your resume to the Beijing Television Station? You man, you. Hur Hur. What should I say to you. Well, this matter is also my fault. I didn\u2019t contact you immediately, making your thoughts wander. Teacher Little Zhang, you might not understand me as a person. I, Hu Fei, have been working in the television system for so many years, and I have never gone back on my word. Since I have already promised you, and did say I cannot guarantee that I could do it, but I would definitely do my very best to get your matter settled!\u201dZhang Ye was said in disbelief, \u201cTeacher Hu, so you are saying\u2026 Your side still wants me?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care what the station thinks. I definitely want you. I fancied your artistic attainment and your literary foundation. Amongst the younger generation, your standard is peerless. Maybe there are people your age or even younger than you who are more famous than you and have greater accomplishments than you, but I dare to say that no one can compare to your literary standard! If I don\u2019t want a person like you, who else do I want?\u201d Hu Fei affirmed.Zhang Ye was excited, \u201cTeacher Hu, then\u2026\u201d\u201cCome to the Beijing Television Station this afternoon for the interview. I have already arranged it for you.\u201d Hu Fei hesitated for a while, \u201cBut I still have to tell you this. I may acknowledge you, but the matter of the host and guest selection is decided by the higher-ups. My opinion can only have a certain degree of influence. After all, the situation you caused was not tiny. It still hasn\u2019t calmed down yet. I believe you know this very well, too, so I cannot guarantee you that the interview will be successful. For this interview, there will also be a Leader from higher up. In short, do well; I will fully support you!\u201d\u201cThank you, Teacher Hu!\u201d Zhang Ye said emotionally.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to thank me. The situation hasn\u2019t been fixed. It won\u2019t be too late thanking me when you succeed. Also, I need to say that this opportunity was not given to you by me. You earned it yourself. You have used your literary foundation to conquer me, and conquered many people. This is something you deserve!\u201d Actually, before Zhang Ye won the Silver Microphone Award, Hu Fei only appreciated Zhang Ye, hoping that he could come help him. However, after Zhang Ye\u2019s \u201cDead Water\u201d at the award presentation ceremony, Hu Fei was first speechless, then angry, and then finally\u2026 He appreciated Zhang Ye even more. That \u201cDead Water\u201d had completely conquered Hu Fei. Hu Fei felt that Zhang Ye was the talent he needed the most at that moment. No one else would work!The call ended.Zhang Ye took a deep breath, feeling things have changed!The Beijing Television Station was interviewing him! He still had a chance of entering a television station!This news was no doubt what made Zhang Ye the most happy today. It was more exciting than the news of publishing \u201cGhost Blows Out the Light\u201d. Publication was just temporary, and the popularity was just temporary. To really become famous, to continue on increasing his popularity, he had to go on television!However, there was a major drawback about going on television, which was that it was easy to suffer destruction to both people and family!Look at the excellent programs and talk shows on television. Those who go up on stage would mention how many people had died in their family. Today was a grandfather\u2019s death, tomorrow would be her father\u2019s death. Later on, his aunt would have cancer, and the day after their family\u2019s dog would suffer from prostatitis!One was worse than the other!Hence, from a certain angle, going on television was very dangerous. If you didn\u2019t have destruction happening to both people and family, you would be embarrassed going up!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 92": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I\u2019m Really a SuperstarCH 91Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 91: Television Station Interview \u2013 Literature Contest!That afternoon.Beijing Television Station.In an office at a certain floor, Zhang Ye was led by a staff member from the front desk. He did not even see which floor the elevator had stopped at. This was because he was feeling a bit worried. He knew this was the last chance for him to enter a television station. So he treated it with highest regard, hoping that he could grab this opportunity.The office was empty.\u201cTeacher Zhang, please wait a minute.\u201d the staff member said.\u201cAlright.\u201d Zhang Ye sat on a chair by the side.The staff said, \u201cThe Leader should be coming soon.\u201dZhang Ye said, \u201cSure, do what you need to do. Thank you very much.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. Then I\u2019ll go first.\u201d The staff left after closing the door.After a few minutes, a plump, middle-aged man pushed open the door and saw Zhang Ye immediately. He said with a sigh, \u201cTeacher Little Zhang, you\u2019ve come?\u201d\u201cYou are?\u201d Zhang Ye found the voice familiar.The middle-aged fatty said, \u201cI\u2019m Hu Fei. We\u2019ve spoken on the phone twice.\u201dZhang Ye immediately came forward to shake hands with him, \u201cOh, so it\u2019s Teacher Hu. It\u2019s nice to meet you.\u201dHu Fei had previously seen Zhang Ye at the Silver Microphone Awards, but Zhang Ye had not seen him. This was the first time they had actually interacted, so they exchanged pleasantries.Finally, Hu Fei got round to business, \u201cTeacher Little Zhang, you have to be mentally prepared for today\u2019s interview. There might not be too much hope.\u201dZhang Ye was stunned, \u201c\u2026I got it.\u201dHu Fei explained, \u201cI have already repeatedly communicated with the management. In the morning, when I spoke with you, I still thought that I could convince them. But after all I said, they still felt you were not up to the task. The incident of you saying \u2018Dead Water\u2019 back then gave them concerns, and they were not\u2026 I have tried my very best. In a while, I will also try my best to help you win the job, but I can tell that they do not wish to let you come to the Beijing Television Station. Even if you were to pass the interview perfectly, they might not hire you. So, I\u2019m informing you beforehand. You can only blame me for not doing my job in advance.\u201dZhang Ye immediately said, \u201cI can\u2019t blame you. You have already helped me so much. It was my fault. Since I said \u2018Dead Water\u2019, scolding the unit and the management, then I already had the preparations to bear the consequences. So it\u2019s alright.\u201dSuddenly, footsteps from outside could be heard.Hu Fei stopped talking with Zhang Ye and sat on an interview seat behind the desk.Zhang Ye was feeling bitter. This was like a roller coaster ride. A few hours ago, Hu Fei\u2019s words had given him hope. But in a blink of an eye, the situation had changed. He went from having hope to not having hope. He had not even gone through the interview, but he already knew he was sure to fail the interview? It was meaningless, no matter how well he answered? Zhang Ye felt his heart go cold to the freezing point, but he did not complain. As he said, since he had done certain things, he had to bear the consequences. Life had always been fair, so he had nothing to complain about!Getting something is because I\u2019m lucky!Losing something is because of my fate!Zhang Ye remained silent for a moment. His mental state also calmed down. Of course, he did not completely give up. Even if he knew the chances were slim or even zero, he still wanted to try!The interviewers came in, one after another.There were around 8-9 people. They were probably the channel or station\u2019s junior heads or staff.\u201cOld Hu, you\u2019ve already come?\u201d A 40+-year-old middle-aged man said.\u201cI also just came in,\u201d Hu Fei answered.The middle-aged man looked at Zhang Ye, \u201cThis is Zhang Ye? Let\u2019s begin then.\u201d\u201cAlright, then let\u2019s allow Little Zhang to prepare?\u201d Hu Fei suggested.Zhang Ye said calmly, \u201cI\u2019m fine. I can have my interview any moment.\u201dEveryone sat down. The middle-aged man that had spoken previously then sat in the middle. His name was Wang Shuixin. His name sounded slightly feminine, and he looked gentle, with his golden wire-rimmed glasses. Zhang Ye had checked the television station\u2019s official website\u2019s information before he came. He knew this person was the Beijing Television Station\u2019s Arts Channel\u2019s Director. He was probably the Leader of all the people present, and head of the Arts Channel.There was not much public information one could find on the internet, but there was plenty of information about Wang Shuixin. Before he left, Zhang Ye had happened to find it online. Director Wang happened to be a poet in the past. A few years ago, he had published a few works and anthologies. He was best at modern poems. Although he did not have many works in recent times, he was still famous. Most people in the industry still knew him.It was quite obvious after giving it some thought. As the head of the television\u2019s Arts Channel, he would not be able to have the role without some ability. He definitely had to have some literary quality to him.\u201cFirst introduce yourself?\u201d Director Wang Shuixin said.\u201cMy name is Zhang Ye. I\u2019m 23 years old this year. I graduated from\u2026\u201d Zhang Ye began his self-introduction.During this, a few interviewers were whispering to each other. Some frowned, while others shook their heads. It was as if they did not wish for Zhang Ye to enter their Arts Channel.Wang Shuixin was also one of them. Back at the Silver Microphone Awards, he and Hu Fei were present. He had heard with his own ears Zhang Ye\u2019s angry recitation of \u201cDead Water\u201d. The atmosphere seemed to have exploded, but Wang Shuixin had secretly shook his head. He knew that Zhang Ye was a problematic person. It was not easy to handle him. His literary standards were passable, but his temper was too terrible. No Leader would want such a person. Leaders tended to want obedient subordinates, so by getting such a different kind of guy in, he would not be as gregarious and he had to worry that he would stir up something daily! So even though he treated Teacher Hu\u2019s recommendations seriously, Wang Shuixin was unimpressed!Of course, there was another reason.Wang Shuixin actually felt that Hu Fei was blowing Zhang Ye\u2019s so-called literary level out of proportions. And it was this matter. He never believed that Zhang Ye could compete on the same level as him. He felt that Zhang Ye was still far inferior! \u201cDead Water\u201d? \u201cA Generation\u201d? Wang Shuixin believed that he could write such poems, too. He even felt that his previous works were much better than Zhang Ye\u2019s.Cultured people tended to scorn each other!No one considered themselves inferior!Actually, the other interviewers had the same thoughts. Although Zhang Ye was highly acclaimed on the internet, they did not think that Zhang Ye could be compared to a master like Wang Shuixin. In the literature scene, Wang Shuixin was clearly not the most famous person, but he was a veteran who had many excellent works. Furthermore, he had several poems that were very popular. So how good could Zhang Ye, a young kid who had just appeared, be against Director Wang? At this interview, they were, in fact, not bothered. As Director Wang\u2019s attitude was very clear, Zhang Ye was definitely not going to be hired!Zhang Ye finished his introduction.Hu Fei interjected, \u201cDirector, Teacher Little Zhang has one of the highest literary skills amongst his generation. He is the best amongst his peers. Besides\u2026\u201dWang Shuixin interrupted his words, \u201cHe can be considered good amongst his peers, but he is far too inferior compared to predecessors who are in the arts.\u201dHu Fei tried to fight for Zhang Ye, \u201cWith Little Zhang\u2019s literary foundation, he is not necessarily worse than the predecessors.\u201dWang Shuixin was amused, \u201cYou are too absolute, Old Hu. I know that you appreciate Little Zhang, but maybe Little Zhang\u2019s literary skills match your appetite and managed to move you. But that does not mean others will be moved. It does not mean his literary skills are flawless. I know about the matter from the Mid-Autumn Poetry Meet. I also know Big Thunder, Old Zheng and a few of them. Do you think Little Zhang has exceeded people from the older generation just because you think Little Zhang overshadowed them? Not really. Actually, Big Thunder and company\u2019s poems are just a bit famous in the Beijing circles. They aren\u2019t much in the country. I also heard their poems back then at the Mid-Autumn Poetry Meet. They were all quite average. So Little Zhang overshadowing them can\u2019t show anything.\u201dThis Director was clearly a scholar to the bone. His temperament was competitive. He did not mince his words and had said it in front of Zhang Ye.Zhang Ye gave him a glance and did not comment.Hu Fei wanted to add on, \u201cBut Teacher Little Zhang\u2026\u201d\u201cThen let\u2019s test him with an interview question.\u201d Wang Shuixin said very confidently, \u201cI can tell you, Old Hu, that he is weaker than me, not to mention other predecessor masters.\u201d Saying that, Wang Shuixin looked at Zhang Ye, \u201cLittle Zhang, we are just blindly chatting amongst ourselves. We aren\u2019t saying you are terrible, so don\u2019t take it to heart. Actually, to write \u2018Dead Water\u2019 at your age is already not bad.\u201dJust not bad?Zhang Ye smiled without speaking. He only thought that he was too careless!\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll not talk about your physical factors. I\u2019ll give you an interview question. There will only be one today for this interview. I actually want to see how much ability and skill a young man like you, who was recommended by Old Hu, has.\u201d Wang Shuixin said.Zhang Ye said, \u201cPlease say it.\u201dWang Shuixin seemed to have the intentions to compete with Zhang Ye in literature, \u201cI have a poem that I\u2019m not sure if you have heard of. It\u2019s called \u2018Everything\u2019.\u201dHe began reciting.\u201cEverything is fated.\u201d\u201cEverything is unreal.\u201d\u201cEverything has no end.\u201d\u201cEverything has no home to return to.\u201d\u201cEvery happiness doesn\u2019t come with a smile.\u201d\u201cEvery suffering doesn\u2019t have tears.\u201d\u201cEvery past is in the dreams.\u201d\u201cEvery faith comes with longing.\u201d\u201cEvery burst is preceded by moments of silence.\u201d\u201cEvery death has a prolonged echo!\u201dAfter a few interviewers heard this, they gave their praises again.\u201cGood poem!\u201d a middle-aged woman said.A youth said, \u201cThis is Director Wang\u2019s best poem, right? I always feel something whenever I hear it!\u201dHu Fei also had to admit that this poem was excellent. This was probably written about four to five years ago by Wang Shuixin when he was at the lowest point of his life. It was very powerful. It called out to people\u2019s hearts and shocked the world!Wang Shuixin said calmly, \u201cLittle Zhang, this is the interview question. This is one of the works that can be considered famous, and also a modern poem that I\u2019m most pleased with. Teacher Hu has always said that your poetry is excellent and you have deep literary foundations. Then can you compose a poem here on the spot, to show us your literary level?\u201dIf it was a poem that had no boundaries, it would have been nothing!But it was Wang Shuixin who said his own poem first, which meant he wanted to compete with Zhang Ye. It was also called a \u201cPoem Contest\u201d. If Zhang Ye was to create another work, it had to be targeted at Wang Shuixin\u2019s work. Furthermore, it had to exceed Director Wang\u2019s poem for him to pass. But was this possible?Hu Fei knew it was impossible!Not to mention the other interviewers!What sort of poem was \u201cEverything\u201d? It was a poem that was previously included in high school textbooks! Although it was in an appendix and was not eye-catching, and was eventually removed due to its dark and depressing artistic quality, it was still a model essay that was once made into teaching material!What could Zhang Ye use to compete with it?He had nothing to compete with it!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 93": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I\u2019m Really a SuperstarCH 92Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 92: \u201cThis is also Everything\u201d!The interview question was out.Everyone looked at Zhang Ye, wondering how he was to answer. He had to follow up on a tough poem that had previously gone in Chinese language textbooks, Wang Shuixin\u2019s most famous poem, \u201cEverything\u201d.Zhang Ye did not speak for a long while.\u201cEverything\u201d? Why did it sound so familiar?He was sure that he had heard this poem somewhere, but he could not remember it clearly. Hence, he said, \u201cCan I have some water?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Wang Shuixin turned his head.An interviewer threw a bottle of mineral water to Zhang Ye.Zhang Ye used the time to drink the water and opened his game ring and bought a \u201cMemory Search Capsule\u201d. He closed his eyes, pretending to be in thought. In fact, he had swallowed the capsule while drinking water. He was searching the memories in his brain, and finally Zhang Ye opened his eyes. He had found his memory and had finally remembered why this poem sounded so familiar!What the f**k!Wasn\u2019t this\u00a0Bei Dao\u2018s \u201cEverything\u201d!?However, there were some slight differences!For example in his world, Bei Dao had written, \u201cEvery fate is destined. Every cloud is fleeting. Every beginning is without an ending. Every search is brief.\u201dAs for Wang Shuixin\u2019s poem, it was \u201cEverything is fated. Everything is unreal. Everything has no end. Everything has no home to return to.\u201d It may look different, but the format and meaning were about the same. The core idea was similar. One of the lines, \u201cEvery faith comes with longing\u201d, was identical in both poems. There was not a single word different!This world also had something similar to \u201cEverything\u201d?However, there was no Bei Dao, but it was written by Wang Shuixin?This was not surprising either. The two worlds\u2019 cultural backgrounds weren\u2019t much different. The Four Great Classical Novels, such as Romance of the Three Kingdoms and Water Margin, still existed. Maybe it was because the Four Great Classical Novels had too strong of an effect ingrained in the country, so there was no way of changing it. So it was not modified by the game ring. Then it was pretty normal to have similar literature works from both worlds. \u00a0Of course, they were just similar. In Zhang Ye\u2019s world, Bei Dao was a very famous poet. In terms of text and profoundness, Zhang Ye clearly believed Bei Dao\u2019s \u201cEverything\u201d was much more excellent than Wang Shuixin\u2019s \u201cEverything\u201d!This was the topic?Zhang Ye laughed, for he could not control himself.Bei Dao\u2019s \u201cEverything\u201d was considered quite famous, but the reason why Zhang Ye did not remember it to the point of needing to use the Memory Search Capsule to search his memories for it was because there was another poem that was more famous. It was written as a retort to Bei Dao\u2019s \u201cEverything\u201d. It had completely negated Bei Dao\u2019s work, hence Zhang Ye and the people from his world had a deeper impression of that poem and had forgotten about Bei Dao\u2019s \u201cEverything\u201d. Even if people from his world mentioned \u201cEverything\u201d, it was to use it as a reference or backstory. It was as if \u201cEverything\u201d existed just to accentuate the other poem. Hence, no matter how well it was written, and had cried out the lives of people so perfectly, in front of that poem, \u201cEverything\u201d was just a supporting role, and considered a sidekick. It could only be hidden under a shade!\u201cAre you done?\u201d a woman urged.\u201cCan you begin?\u201d a young interviewer was also turning impatient.Seeing that Zhang Ye did not speak for so long, Hu Fei guessed that Zhang Ye was unable to follow up. He sighed in his heart. Zhang Ye had low odds of success, and it would have been impossible for him to be accepted by the Leader. Wang Shuixin\u2019s attitude was very clear. Now, by not being able to answer the interview question, the chances of hiring him were close to nil.However, Hu Fei\u2019s love for talent was very deep. He was still trying his best to help Zhang Ye fight for it, \u201cDirector Wang. Little Zhang is still young, so no matter how much talent he has, he can\u2019t compare to you. This question is indeed quite difficult. Shall we change a topic and let Little Zhang have freedom to express a poem?\u201d\u201cBrother Hu, \u201d a female interviewer said, \u201cthen what\u2019s the point of an interview? Anyone can write something freely. That\u2019s not ability.\u201dWang Shuixin also lightly laughed, \u201cOld Hu, to speak the truth, I want to test Little Zhang\u2019s creative ability on the spot today. It seems all his poems in the past were created on the spot. As for the poem\u2019s quality and logic, I\u2019ll reserve my judgment. I don\u2019t believe those good works of his were written on the spot by Little Zhang. It doesn\u2019t agree with reason. Even if it was written on the spot, it couldn\u2019t be done without any stammering, right? And those poems of his had so much logic? And the parallelism was done so well? And since you appreciate this youth so much, I\u2019m testing him this time. So I purposely used my poem to let him follow up. First, it\u2019s to see if he really can compose on the spot, and secondly, to see if Little Zhang really has as much literary skill as people say.\u201dHu Fei said, \u201cBut to follow up on a classic poem that even entered language textbooks, Little Zhang will\u2026\u201dWang Shuixin waved his hand to stop Hu Fei from continuing. He looked at Zhang Ye, \u201cIt\u2019s alright, Little Zhang. Take your time to think; there\u2019s no hurry. Hur Hur. At your age, you might not have heard this poem. When you were in high school, the materials for your language class might not have included \u201cEverything\u201d. If you did not catch everything, I can recite it to you again.\u201dA youth volunteered, \u201cSince you already recited it once, why don\u2019t you let me, Director Wang?\u201d\u201cAlright, Little Xu, you do it. Hur Hur.\u201d Wang Shuixin was in a good mood. He had been doing administrative work all these years, so for him to once again display his literary works was a rare event. Seeing Zhang Ye remaining silent, and his subordinates looking at him with admiration and respect, Wang Shuixin was very pleased.The other interviewers and the youth completely ignored Zhang Ye. They knew that it was impossible for Zhang Ye to follow up on the poem. The only reason that they were still in here to interview Zhang Ye was to kiss ass and flatter the Leader. They wanted to see with their own eyes how their Leader defeated Zhang Ye, a newcomer who had been praised for his poetry. Besides, even without the flattering factor, Director Wang did have the absolute ability!Zhang Ye? A newcomer!Compared to Director Wang, what was he!?He wanted to compete with Wang Shuixin in literature and poetry? Wasn\u2019t this do something beyond his ability!?Director Wang\u2019s \u201cEverything\u201d came about due to his using all his senses to come into maximum contact with the pulse of life. He had used his critical perspective to inspect the interpersonal moral and ethical relations, as well as the sparks that arose when people clashed. He had also subconsciously pondered above love, freedom, joy, suffering, hope and death, which were all common factors of human life. It was one of the best modern poems, and could be said that he had written a poem of such a genre at its peak. Zhang Ye wanted to use the literary insight from \u201cEverything\u201d as a topic to exceed \u201cEverything\u201d? That was impossible!Well, but it was not that the poem did not have its flaws. If one wanted to pick faults with it, it was probably the reason why it was eventually removed from the language textbooks. The poem was too dark and oppressive. There was no hope in it. This was also why \u201cEverything\u201d was criticized by some people. But the flaws could not obscure the splendor it possessed. This poem was still enjoying a relatively high status in the poetry world. It could be considered a \u201cpessimism\u201d masterpiece.\u201cLet me recite it, while you listen well.\u201d the youth said to Zhang Ye.Zhang Ye ignored him, and already had his plans.The youth frowned. You even turned haughty? Just because you were praised to the skies by people who did not know literature, you already forgot who you were? See, your original form has been revealed! I have no idea why Teacher Hu appreciated you so much. You can only have your way with Big Thunder and those slightly known poets in Beijing. But take a look; once you encounter a real master of literature, you have nothing against them, right?The youth grunted and cleared his throat, \u201cEverything is fated. Everything is unreal. Everything has no end. Everything has no home to return to.\u201dWang Shuixin squinted his eyes as he listened to his poem.The other interviewers again revealed their reverence. Their mouths moved gently, as if they were tasting the poem, and were also reciting it along with the youth.The youth carried on, \u201cEvery happiness doesn\u2019t come with a smile. Every suffering..\u201dBut suddenly, a scene no one expected happened. Zhang Ye opened his vocal cords and interrupted the youth, who was having a good time reciting, rudely!Zhang Ye shook his head, \u201cNot every tree has been broken off by the storm; Not every seed cannot find soil to root; Not every true feeling is lost in the deserts of human hearts; Not every dream wishes to be cut off at its wings. No, not everything\u2026 is like what you said!\u201dHu Fei gasped. This\u2026This poem\u2026Wang Shuixin and the other 7-8 interviewers were stunned!Zhang Ye looked at Director Wang and then at a few interviewers, then began stressing his words, \u201cNot every torch is burning itself, but not illuminating others; Not every star indicates darkness, but does not predict the dawn; Not every song passes through the ears, but does not stay in the hearts. No, not everything\u2026 is like what you said!\u201dThe second paragraph was also out!It was another massive parallelism! His tone also grew stronger!Wang Shuixin\u2019s expression instantly looked ugly, but he made no sound!However, Hu Fei got a kick hearing this. He clenched his fists and was so excited that he wanted to stand up to cheer for Zhang Ye. This was the first time that he had such a bright smile on his face. He was happy for Zhang Ye and also happy for himself. He had not evaluated Zhang Ye wrongly! He was really a remarkable talent of the age!Zhang Ye scanned everyone with his eyes and purposely paused before reciting the last paragraph. For this paragraph, he wiped off the solemnity and seriousness, and changed it to that of a smile. There was even mockery in his smile, \u201cNot every appeal has been dismissed; Not every loss cannot be compensated; Not every abyss is death; Not every grief lands on the heads of the weak; Not every heart and soul are to be stepped on and buried in the mud; Not every consequence is blood and tears, but without mirth!\u201d\u201cEverything in the present is creating the future!\u201d\u201cEverything in the future is grown from yesterday.\u201d\u201cHope, and to fight for it, please put all of them on your shoulders!\u201dThe last shout was Zhang Ye saying it to Wang Shuixin, and could also be him saying it to himself!Everything was darkness? Everything was suffering? Every success was accompanied by tears and sorrow?Be it Bei Dao\u2019s \u201cEverything\u201d or Wang Shuixin\u2019s \u201cEverything\u201d, Zhang Ye could not agree with them!He knew that many people hated him, or had a grudge with him or disliked him. He also knew that he had not much hope for this interview, but Zhang Ye had never felt that his life was filled with darkness. He had never hesitated in his life. As long as he had a glimmer of hope, he would never give up!That was everything?Everything is like what you said?No! Not everyone is like what you said!At least, I am not! I, Zhang Ye, am not!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Some liked to use body language. Some had varying tones when delivering the recitals. And some did it with a straight face. There were all sorts of reciters. Those who were not skilled at recitals would always attempt to copy someone else\u2019s style or just not attempt a style at all and recite it just as it is. But someone like Zhang Ye, who was from a background of media arts, would always recite in their own style. This was his rice bowl; he would not lose to anyone in a basic skill like that. His recitals tended to be calmer. He was used to expressing his emotions through the subtle expressions of his eyes and the tonal changes in his voice, and did not use exaggerated body language like dancing and shouting.From the results, it looked like he had done a very good interpretation of the poem.These interviewers, each and every one of them had a shocked look!\u201cI\u2019ve finished reciting it. This poem\u2026is called \u2018This is also Everything\u2019.\u201d Zhang Ye said lightly after adjusting his breath and looking at the interviewers.Director Wang\u2019s \u201cEverything\u201d!Zhang Ye followed up with \u201cThis is also Everything\u201d!The former was filled with the cries of darkness! While the latter was overflowing with the light of hope!Zhang Ye\u2019s work was heard! The 8-9 interviewers looked at each other. They were thinking that this wasn\u2019t some poetry competition with Director Wang; it was clearly a smacking of face! You were clearly here to mess things up! They had initially thought that Zhang Ye was unable to follow up, or even if he did, it would not have been good. As for a \u201cpessimism\u201d poem, \u201cEverything\u201d was impeccable! Using the line of thought of Wang Shuixin\u2019s poem to carry on writing a pessimistic modern poem? He would never be able to write something better than \u201cEverything\u201d, no matter how much he tried!However, no one had expected Zhang Ye to do the opposite. He did not follow the line of thought of \u201cEverything\u201d. He had instead used \u201cThis is also Everything\u201d to lambaste this pessimistic view!Not all!Not all!No, not everything\u2026 is like what you said!A few lines of \u201cNot everything\u201d had gradually stepped up the mood of this poem and at the same time stepped down on \u201cEverything\u201d!If this wasn\u2019t face slapping, what was?If this wasn\u2019t a blatant challenge, what was?But somehow, this blatant challenge had sent shockwaves down everyone\u2019s spines. A few interviewers who had not thought much of Zhang Ye initially had been swept along with their emotions while hearing Zhang Ye\u2019s poetry. A few lines of \u201cNot everything\u201d had convinced them as they maintained their stunned faces.This is Zhang Ye? This was the Zhang Ye that they didn\u2019t think much of? Director Wang had doubted Zhang Ye\u2019s composing on the spot before this? He felt that his poems were all prepared beforehand to fool the listeners? And felt that Zhang Ye\u2019s literary standards could only be compared alongside amateur poets? And if he met a professional poet, he would be exposed? Those who had thought this to themselves earlier were now blushing from embarrassment!And they thought he was just so-so?Or that he could not compose on the spot!This was called a low literary standard that could only be compared to low-grade poets?Zhang Ye\u2019 s \u201cThis is also Everything\u201d had made them swallow their words. Even the least literary educated person present could tell that Director Wang had been outdone by a newcomer! \u201cEverything\u201d had really been overshadowed by \u201cThis is also Everything\u201d! And the gap did not feel like it was by a small margin. It was a crushing victory! There was no question about it!Zhang Ye\u2019s poem had even answered the biggest flaw of \u201cEverything\u201d \u2014 Pessimism! It was full of optimism in \u201cThis is also Everything\u201d! Full of positive influence on the people! No wonder \u201cEverything\u201d was only in the appendix of the high school textbook for a short one year. Compared to \u201cThis is also Everything\u201d, \u201cEverything\u201d was such a shallow and weak piece. Instead, Zhang Ye\u2019s poem looked like it should be added into the textbooks!They all whispered to each other. All of them had been shocked by this poetry piece of Zhang Ye\u2019s!But none of them knew. In Zhang Ye\u2019s world, this poem was precisely born because of Bei Dao\u2019s \u201cEverything\u201d.\u201cThis is also Everything\u201d \u2014 This was a piece by a famous poet in Zhang Ye\u2019s old world, the writer Shuting\u2019s work. It was rumored that after Bei Dao\u2019s work was criticized for being too pessimistic, Shuting had also criticized something about it. Soon after, \u201cThis is also Everything\u201d was born. From its words, parallelisms and thoughts, it could be seen that \u201cThis is also Everything\u201d was targeted at \u201cEverything\u201d! So after Wang Shuixin had read his poem, Zhang Ye\u2019s immediate thought was this work of Shuting\u2019s!Poetry competition?This poem was made for it!This was walking into the line of fire!Hu Fei had given Zhang Ye a thumbs up in his heart. He looked over at the silent Wang Shuixin, \u201cDirector, Little Zhang has answered the interview question. What do you think?\u201dThe others also looked over at Director Wang.Wang Shuixin acknowledged, \u201cIt\u2019s matched pretty well.\u201dHow was it just pretty well! It was perfect! But of course they did not say that\u2026 No one was that dumb!Hu Fei took advantage of the situation and asked, \u201cThen about Little Zhang\u2019s recruitment?\u201dWang Shuixin looked at Zhang Ye, \u201cLittle Zhang, stand up and let me have a look at you.\u201d\u201cStand up?\u201d Zhang Ye did so accordingly.Wang Shuixin took a look and shook his head, \u201cI won\u2019t comment on his looks since a minority of successful hosts and guests are lacking in that department, too. But your height is even more important compared to your looks. If I\u2019m not wrong, after your shoes are off, your height is around 1.65m, right? That\u2019s too short; even with shoes on, you won\u2019t hit 1.70m. If you were onstage with other hosts or guests, your height would be a problem. If a female guest wears slightly higher heels, you\u2019d probably be shorter by half a head or more. How can you become a host like that? It will affect the broadcast quality. If your looks are ordinary and you are lacking in height, then it certainly will not work!\u201dGreat!You couldn\u2019t find fault with my literary standards, so now you started picking on my height?Zhang Ye was thinking that if he was f**king tall and handsome, then he wouldn\u2019t be wasting so much effort here! He would have gone to become a singer or movie actor!Hu Fei added, \u201cLittle Zhang can add insoles to his shoes.\u201d\u201cThat at most will add 6-7cm to his height. Any taller than that and it wouldn\u2019t look natural. A look and you will know there\u2019s no conformity. What\u2019s the use of that 6-7cm? At most, he will be 1.7m tall with his shoes and insoles.\u201d Wang Shuixin was finding faults, \u201cOur male hosts at the Beijing Television Station, which one of them doesn\u2019t reach 1.8m after wearing shoes? It is the minimum requirement to reach the height of 1.8 with shoes.\u201d After that, he also sighed, \u201cOld Hu, I\u2019ve seem Little Zhang\u2019s talent today. It\u2019s not bad. You didn\u2019t make a wrong choice, but his height is not enough. If his height can reach the standard, he can report to work after National Day! I wouldn\u2019t say anything else!\u201dHe could be hired as long as he was taller?But this was actually a load of rubbish!Looks were not hard to change. There was plastic surgery. But how could one change one\u2019s height? Zhang Ye was already 23 years old. As the saying goes, one could still grow at 23, but no matter how much you grew, you couldn\u2019t go from 1.65 to 1.75! Do you think that you were sitting on a rocket!? That you could increase your height so easily!?It was clear that he did not want Zhang Ye!It was just a way of rejecting him by saying that he would be hired if he was taller!Hu Fei was disagreeable with it. He strongly insisted, \u201cDirector, I really want to hire Teacher Little Zhang. My segment is about to begin recording. Little Zhang will be of great help to me, and will also greatly help the station.\u201d Saying this, Hu Fei said to Zhang Ye, \u201cTeacher Little Zhang, why don\u2019t you go out to the resting area and wait for a while?\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Zhang Ye could only take his things and leave the room.Outside, he could hear Teacher Hu fighting for him. Zhang Ye knew that there was no hope left. He could only take Teacher Hu\u2019s appreciation of him in his mind. He would return the favor in the future slowly.After he waited for a while, no one came out.Zhang Ye leaned on the windowsill and watched the traffic flow below. Suddenly, he saw a shoe shop across the road. Seeing this, he also wanted to try to see how much elevator shoes could increase his height. Who knew if he could reach the height of 1.8m wearing them? Zhang Ye had never tried them, so he quickly took the elevator downstairs.On the side of the road.It was a foreign shoes shop named HT.\u201cSir, what type of shoes do you want to buy?\u201d A female attendant came forward.Zhang Ye asked, \u201cDo you sell any insoles or shoes that can raise a person\u2019s height?\u201dThe female attendant smiled, \u201cThere aren\u2019t insoles, but there are elevator shoes. This way, please.\u201d She led Zhang Ye over. \u201cThere are two styles. They are elevated leather shoes and can increase your height by about 5-8cm.\u201dZhang Ye tried them. Although he felt some discomfort in his heels, he was indeed much taller. However, it was clear that 8cm was an exaggeration. It was not that much, and was probably at most 6cm. With Zhang Ye\u2019s height, he could only reach 1.71m at most. He was still shorter than Wang Shuixin\u2019s lowest requirement of 1.8m by nearly 10cm. The difference was too great, and could definitely not meet the requirement. Zhang Ye smacked his lips but still decided to buy the shoes. He did not wear his shoes and let the attendant remove the tags. He wore the new shoes and walked back to the television station, returning to the resting area.Every bit helps in becoming tall.Who knows\u2026 If Teacher Hu was helping him, maybe he might have a chance?Hai, what was he thinking!? He was still having hopes when he knew there was no chance?Right, why was he relying on others? He still had his game ring! He could try his luck at the Lottery!Zhang Ye suddenly thought of it. Every time he faced a tough situation, he had used the magical items from the game ring to resolve them. Who knew if the Heavens would be standing on his side today?The office on the other side was still having arguments. There was Hu Fei\u2019s voice, and the voices of the other interviewers. It did not seem like it would be over in ten minutes.He did as he thought!Zhang Ye immediately opened the game interface!The menu opened, and a virtual screen was presented before Zhang Ye\u2019s eyes. Staff from the television station who walked past could not see it at all.Then, a glance at the Reputation points he had accumulated over the past few days made Zhang Ye extremely pleased. His overall Reputation points had reached an alarming 930,000!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 95": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I\u2019m Really a SuperstarCH 94Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 94: A Huge Discovery About the Lottery!The explosive outbreak of \u201cDead Water\u201d.The receiving of the Silver Microphone Award.The listenership ratings of the unstopped \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019.The large scale promotions and sales of \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019.And even \u2018Tribute to the White Poplar\u2019 and various other contributions.All these Reputation points that were accumulated allowed Zhang Ye to have more than 900,000 Reputation points at this moment. It looked like an exaggeration, but it was accumulated by Zhang Ye bit by bit through hard work. Every Reputation point increment was not easy for him. Of course, before the \u201cMemory Search Capsule\u201d that he had bought just a while ago, it had already exceeded a million.The Lottery interface opened.Zhang Ye decided to take a gamble.He clicked on the Lottery and spent 100,000 Reputation points. Confirm!The wheel began to move. The needle began rapidly moving. As it was a bet, Zhang Ye decided to have Additional Stakes. After clicking the Additional Stakes button on the bottom right, he gave it some thought and added two Additional Stakes. After all, he needed to leave some Reputation to bet on the next chance. He could not use it all on one try.The needle began to move slowly.Special Category\u2026 Skills Category\u2026Stats Category\u2026Consumption Category\u2026The needle began to slow down gradually. Finally, it stopped on the Consumption Category!Zhang Ye did not have much hope, nor was he disappointed. This was because he did not know what items he needed at this moment. He was only trying his luck.Three Treasure Chest (Small) appeared!Zhang Ye brought them and placed them on a table in the resting area. He opened one after another. Since all the items that were obtained from Additional Stakes were the same, he just needed to see one.[ Lucky Bread ] x 3!He had previously obtained this prize before. And this was also the first time that Zhang Ye had obtained an item that he had received before!However, Zhang Ye gave a wry smile. The Lucky Bread may be good, but it was not very useful for him now. Back at the award presentation ceremony, the Lucky Bread had expounded its miraculous effects, allowing him to magically receive the award. But it had a reason to. It was because of luck that the trophy and certificate both had problems backstage, which caused such an effect.But this time, it was different. Luck was useless here. As it was not something that could change from subjective means. Wang Shuixin had objectively not wanted Zhang Ye. He had already said that Zhang Ye was not tall enough. So no matter how lucky he was, Director Wang would definitely not change his attitude.He had lost the bet!Hai, there aren\u2019t many opportunities left!Zhang Ye was feeling down. He was already used to having items he received from the Lottery being of use. For example, the Save, the Unlucky Sticker, or the Memory Search Capsule, all of them were a great help to him after they were obtained. And even though the Lucky Bread from back then was not something that he had received on the spot and was something he had stored from a previous luck of the draw, it had been effective at the critical moment. Even the Unlucky Halo and the Invisibility Potion had their own usage.However, this time it wasn\u2019t enough!Zhang Ye no longer had the luck from before!His hand nearly pressed down on the Lottery purchase button, but he paused and did not press down on it. Zhang Ye knew it was impossible. Actually, upon careful thought, the items he had received from the Lottery were not really just right for the purpose. For example, the Save\u2026 He might have used it, but if he had obtained the Memory Search Capsule, he could have also used it to help him recite from memory. If he swept through at a glance and used the Memory Search, Zhang Ye could similarly recite out 900 words. Furthermore, he could save the time he took to memorize it, and the accuracy would be even higher. And with the Unlucky Sticker, if he had obtained the Lucky Bread or something else, those items could probably create a similar effect, allowing Zhang Ye to get a program. Similarly, if he had used the Unlucky Sticker at the Silver Microphone Awards, giving Zh\u0101ng Y\u011b bad luck, resulting in him being unable to receive an award, the award would have still ended up in Zhang Ye\u2019s hands.It may be said that his luck was good when he had played the Lottery in the past, but it could also be said that the difficulty that Zhang Ye faced was relatively smaller. The difficulty range was much wider, which resulted in many items being able to be used as magical weapons. They could all help.But this time is was different. Wang Shuixin had made his attitude clear. His requirement was on Zhang Ye\u2019s height. Hence, the items that he could draw that would be useful from the Lottery were extremely specific and limited. How could Zhang Ye have such good luck and draw whatever he needed at the Lottery? What a joke. Zhang Ye had never felt that he had good luck!Eh, luck?Wait a moment! Luck?Zhang Ye was suddenly shocked. Then he excitedly stood up from the couch. Right, usually when he played the Lottery, he definitely could not obtain items he was in desperate need of, for he did not have the luck. No one in the world had such luck. Even if they had luck for a moment, it would not be for life. However, Zhang Ye had a sudden thought. So what if he did not have luck? This was not a problem! Without luck\u2026 He could create luck!Lucky Bread!He had just drawn Lucky Bread!Zhang Ye\u2019s mind opened up. Previously, when he had received items from the Lottery, he had only thought about how he could use them in reality, but who made the rules that the luck from the Lucky Bread could not be used on the game\u2019s Lottery? The Lucky Bread\u2019s description said that it could increase the Luck stat of a player for five minutes. Since Zhang Ye\u2019s Luck stat would increase, then drawing at the Lottery was also within its range. He could completely use this to create luck, so as to obtain things he needed!Could it work?Even if it didn\u2019t, he had to try!Zhang Ye felt that this discovery of his was too important. It would be very important for his future. If it was like his speculation, then whenever he was faced with a difficult problem, Zhang Ye would have a chance and method to solve it. He did not need to bet on the so-called luck!Zhang Ye immediately reached his hand into the game ring\u2019s inventory. He took out one of the Lucky Bread, and immediately ate it!Lucky Bread in Effect!Countdown, 4:59...Zhang Ye was afraid that there was not enough time, so he quickly clicked on the Lottery and did not even wait for the needle to slow down as he gritted his teeth to have Additional Stakes. Seeing the needle pause temporarily, Zhang Ye immediately added all his remaining Reputation. Having just spent 300,000 Reputation points, and having spent 100,000 for the Lottery, he still had 5 more Additional Stakes left. Success was all counting on this. Without any hesitation, Zhang Ye spent nearly all of his Reputation points!Additional Stakes completed!The needle began moving again!One revolution\u2026Three revolutions\u2026Five revolutions\u2026Then it slowed down, and the needle slowly moved towards the small region of the Special Category!Zhang Ye was almost about to cry. If it was some normal time, he would love to have the Special Category, because he greatly had the need to be able to permanently purchase items in the Merchant Shop. It was unlimited purchase, and he did not need to draw at the Lottery. But now, he did not need it. Even if he had obtained the right to buy an item, he did not have enough points to buy it! He was only left with about 30,000 Reputation points, so even if he wanted to buy something, it would not be enough!Move!I don\u2019t want the Special Category!A treasure mountain was right in front of him, yet Zhang Ye did not want it. This was the first time that he felt cheap. However, there was no other choice. He had to solve the problem he had now!Move a little bit more!Just a little bit more!Finally, the Special Category was moved past. It did not stop there!The Lottery wheel\u2019s category size was fixed. For example, the Consumption Category\u2019s probability was the greatest, while the Special Category was the lowest. Hence, the size of all the regions were the same every time. However, the placement of the regions were random. For example, the last time that he drew at the Lottery, the Special Category was between the Consumption Category and the Skills Category. But this time, the Special Category was now in the middle of the Stats Category and the Skills Category. After the needle moved past the Special Category, it immediately stopped at the Stats Category!Bada!Six Treasure Chest (Small) appeared!At this moment, there was still one minute left for the Lucky Bread!Zhang Ye did not dare to delay. This was because he was not sure if the item in the Treasure Chest was decided at the moment it was drawn or if the Lottery only fixed the type, and the specific item was decided only when the treasure chest was opened. Hence, he used the remaining amount of lucky time to open the Treasure Chest!The first Treasure Chest opened \u2013 Fruit of Growth!The second Treasure Chest opened \u2013 Fruit of Growth!The six Treasure Chests all contained a small white fruit. It was basically round, but it was not uniform. It did not have leaves, but had a brown root zone.[ Fruit of Growth ]: Effective upon consuming it. Activates the player's growth genes. Can be stacked repeatedly.Growth?Activates genes?He got it! He really got it!At this moment, the lucky effect ran out. Zhang Ye nearly cried out! His theory was right! The Lucky Bread really could be used on the Lottery system!After a moment of excitement, Zhang Ye regained his composure. He quickly picked up a Fruit of Growth and ate it. He still did not know the effects of the fruit. Although the Fruit of Charm had already proved the effects of such Stats Category items, but what did growth mean? Where would he grow? Please don\u2019t make my chest hair grow? This bro doesn\u2019t need that!After consuming it, his whole body heated up!Zhang Ye nearly shouted out as he felt his bones crunching, as they sounded out!After a few seconds, the strange feeling disappeared. Zhang Ye looked around and looked at his chest. Thankfully, his chest did not get any bigger.But which part of him changed?He could not detect it!But when he looked at his pant legs, Zhang Ye was slightly surprised. His pants had been slightly longer, so that it would roll up above his shoes. But now, the rolls had relaxed a bit more. What was the meaning of this? What did this represent? There was only one possibility presented. That was\u2026 Someone had secretly cut his pant legs with scissors when Zhang Ye was slightly distracted!Alright, actually there was another possibility. It meant that Zhang Ye had grown taller!Although it was just a tiny bit, but it no doubt made him excited!Zhang Ye decided to consume the remaining five Fruits of Growth in one go. The sound of his bones cracking incessantly lingered on.One centimeter\u2026Two centimeters\u2026Three centimeters\u2026Finally, Zhang Ye used the change in his pant leg\u2019s length to guess that he had grown about 5-6 centimeters taller! That was to say, every Fruit of Growth increased his height by nearly a centimeter!Zhang Ye was overjoyed. His looks and height had always been a chronic problem for his development. He never expected one of them to be solved just like that!The Fruit of Growth was too amazing!Zhang Ye understood that this fruit probably did not increase his height directly. It had helped activate his potential within his genes. That was to say, Zhang Ye\u2019s genes should have allowed him to grow to that height, but Zhang Ye had grown up in relatively poor conditions. Without milk to drink, or eggs and much meat to eat, his poor nutrition when he was young stunted his growth. If he was properly fed and nourished when he was young, then he could definitely be like others. At least, he would have a good average height.Now, the Fruits of Growth had remedied all of this!Now, his height was 1.71 meters! He already entered a normal range!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, even the small number of people who came to work was definitely more people than people from other industries by several times. As this was a television station, it was similar to supermarkets or shopping malls. They were busier during this period. There were quite a number of people working overtime, who not far from Zhang Ye, who were looking at him.\u201cWhat was that sound just now?\u201d\u201cI also heard it. It sounded like cracking.\u201d\u201cDid that youth come for an interview? What was he doing just now?\u201d\u201cYeah, why was there so much noise? Was he molting?\u201dA few people began discussing as they pointed fingers at Zhang Ye. They found him weird.Actually, from a certain point of view, Zhang Ye had indeed \u201cmolted\u201d. His height was now 1.71m. If he wore the elevator shoes that he had just bought, he could barely tell from the receding of the pant leg that he was about 1.78m tall with the elevator shoes, even though he did not have a ruler on hand. He was about 2cm shorter than Wang Shuixin\u2019s minimum requirement.Zhang Ye tried to find some paper to pad the bottom of his shoes, but it was obvious that it wouldn\u2019t work. Even if he could pad his height a bit more, it would not be natural. This was already a height increased by a pair of shoes. The heels were already very high, so by padding it with paper, his foot would probably come out of the shoe. There was no way that he could go on screen like that. Even if he went on screen, he was unable to walk, as the shoes would just drop the moment that he walked. There were boots that could increase his height a bit more. However, it was autumn, and the weather wasn\u2019t cold yet. It was sometimes hot, so how could he go on screen with boots? This was also not practical. The interviewers would also not agree to it!\u2026The other side.In the office.Wang Shuixin looked at his watch, \u201cOld Hu, don\u2019t be in a rush. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t believe in your judgment and professional achievements. Our station headhunted you because we appreciated your experience and ability. However, a host is a combination of various aspects. He can\u2019t just be accepted because of his literary foundation. Even if Zhang Ye was made a guest, he is also not up to it. I believe that you know the importance of a segment\u2019s host and its guests. If the audience doesn\u2019t like the visuals, the program will suffer a hit, no matter how good it is. It will also lose a large number of the audience members. I cannot gamble on this.\u201d\u201cIf we are excluding Zhang Ye because of his height, it would be such a pity!\u201d Hu Fei\u2019s eyebrows were knitted together. \u201cThis is too unfair to Little Zhang!\u201dWang Shuixin said lightly, \u201cThe entertainment business has never been about fairness. Little Zhang\u2019s height is indeed not enough. I cannot give the go ahead for him alone.\u201dHu Fei said, \u201cWeren\u2019t there also hosts who had heights around 1.6m in the past?\u201d\u201cBut were they ever popular?\u201d Wang Shuixin retorted, \u201cHow many hosts of those heights managed to make it big? Also you are talking about some second or third tier cities\u2019 small television stations. Where are we? This is Beijing Television Station!\u201d He stood up, \u201cAlright, Old Hu. There\u2019s no point in talking about this anymore. What time is it already? I still need to hold a meeting soon!\u201d\u201cDirector!\u201d Hu Fei tried to speak.Wang Shuixin interrupted, \u201cI can lower my final requirement. He doesn\u2019t need to be 1.8m. As long as he can reach 1.78m with elevator shoes, I will immediately hire him! I will not say another word!\u201d\u201cBrother Hu, forget it.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, Producer Hu. There are plenty of good seedlings.\u201dThe other interviewers also persuaded Hu Fei.However, Hu Fei was thinking, \u201cWhat was the difference between 1.78m and 1.8m? Zhang Ye was just 1.65. He wouldn\u2019t reach that height even if wore any kind of shoes! Unless he went on stage with stilts!\u201d\u2026Outside.As the final exchange of words were done while they were approaching the door, Zhang Ye had heard the last line. He just needed 1.78m? Ha! I was just waiting for that word of yours! It looked like the twenty minutes that Teacher Hu had fought for Zhang Ye was not in vain! It had helped him a great deal!The door opened and Wang Shuixin was the first to exit. He looked at Zhang Ye in the resting area. \u201cLittle Zhang, you can go back.\u201d It meant that the interview was over.Hu Fei looked at Zhang Ye, apologetically shaking his head.Zhang Ye gave Teacher Hu a \u201cnevermind\u201d look. He sat there and said to Wang Shuixin, \u201cDirector Wang, I think I have reached the standards you mentioned.\u201d\u201cWhat did you reach? Height?\u201d A young interviewer was amused, \u201cEnough. Go back.\u201dZhang Ye did not say anything further. He only slowly stood up from his seat.A few interviewers were planning to leave, as they had been delayed for far too long. There were many programs for National Day that they had to busy themselves with. However, when they saw Zhang Ye stand up, a person who was about to turn and leave was suddenly stunned. He immediately turned back with his eyes staring widely!Several others also stared widely with their eyes!Holy sh*t! Your height, why\u2026 Why does it seem\u2026Zhang Ye walked closer and let them take a closer look, \u201cDoes this height meet your standards?\u201dWang Shuixin was also dumbfounded. He patted his forehead and also rubbed his eyes. He felt as if his eyes had gone blurry before looking at Zhang Ye again, \u201cYou\u2026\u201dTaller!This person was actually taller!During the interview, Wang Shuixin and a few interviewers remembered clearly that Zhang Ye was about half a head shorter than many of them. Although they were not very tall, they were about 1.7m tall. But now, twenty minutes later, this person was no longer shorter than them, and was instead\u2026 He was instead taller than them by a lot more!Shorter by half a head to taller by half a head?Are you doing magic?They could hardly believe their own eyes!After his surprise, Hu Fei quickly said, \u201cLittle Sun, bring a measuring tape!\u201dA youth looked at Wang Shuixin and seeing Director Wang nod his head, he quickly left and came back shortly after with a retractable ruler.\u201cTeacher Little Zhang, please stand nicely.\u201d Hu Fei gestured.Zhang Ye held his back to the wall and stood very straight.Hu Fei personally measured him and then looked at the marks on the ruler. He turned with a look of surprise and said to everyone, \u201c1.78! Exactly 1.78!\u201dSomeone did not believe it and also measured Zhang Ye, but the result was also the same!The female interviewer nearly fainted on the spot!Wang Shuixin also never expected such a situation!A young interviewer said with fear, \u201cHow, how did you do it?\u201dZhang Ye pointed to his feet, \u201cI changed my shoes. I just bought them!\u201dWang Shuixin, \u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cHow could this be possible!? Where was there such elevator shoes that could increase that much height!?\u201d the youth exclaimed.\u201cIt could increase more than 10 centimeters? And not a trace of it can be detected? Not unnatural at all? What sort of shoes are those?\u201d Another interviewer nearly cursed vulgarities!Go to hell!How are you changing shoes here?You are f**king changing persons!Hu Fei did not care about this. He treated it as if there was such a magical shoe, for technology had developed so much. He stared at Director Wang, \u201cLittle Zhang has reached 1.78m with the shoes, and you said previously?\u201dEveryone else looked at the Director.Wang Shuixin was really\u2026 This guy really did it? He had originally found a reason to reject a problematic person like him, as he did not want him. However, the outcome was too surprising! What should he do now? He could not rescind his words, and furthermore he had said it in front of so many people. He was also the Leader\u2026After a long silence, Wang Shuixin looked at Zhang Ye, \u201cReport to work next week.\u201d After saying that, he turned and led the others away.He had entered the television station!He had finally entered the television station!Zhang Ye suddenly felt like all the hard work had paid off!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After taking the elevator, he did not return to his house, but followed the aroma from the landlady\u2019s house. The door was open and the sound of oil splattering could be heard from the kitchen. At a glance, the little rascal Rao Chenchen was in the living room, doing her homework.\u201cChenchen, are you busy?\u201d Zhang Ye smiled as he entered the house.Chenchen immediately shouted to the kitchen, \u201cAunt! Zhang Ye is here to scrounge for food again!\u201dZhang Ye nearly planted himself on the floor, \u201cThis unlucky child. I treated you well for nothing.\u201dChenchen gave her trademark smile, \u201cHur Hur.\u201d Then she lowered her head and carried on doing her homework.Rao Aimin from inside probably heard this. She opened the kitchen door and did not look kindly at Zhang Ye, \u201cYou really came on time. Is your Chinese Zodiac a dog? You followed the aroma over?\u201dZhang Ye was also not mad, for he had already adapted to her vicious tongue, \u201cI worked so hard for Chenchen, and you said the last time that my food for these days will be settled by you.\u201d\u201cYou only know how to eat. Did you not eat in your last life?\u201d Rao Aimin\u2019s mouth was vicious, but she was soft-hearted. \u201cWait a while. I\u2019ll cook another two more dishes!\u201d\u201cThank you, Landlady Auntie!\u201d\u201cMake sure that Chenchen does her homework!\u201dAfter the small rascal did her homework, the table was already filled with dishes.Rao Aimin threw a pair of chopsticks at Zhang Ye, \u201cYou sure look happy today! Did you pick up a wallet? Eh, wait a moment. Come over and let me take a look. Why are you so much taller?\u201dZhang Ye smiled, \u201cYou finally noticed it. I\u2019m wearing elevator shoes.\u201d\u201cOh, I was just wondering. Alright then, let\u2019s eat!\u201d Rao Aimin sat down and handed a bowl and chopsticks to Chenchen.Actually Zhang Ye was not wearing his elevator shoes, but his own normal shoes. He had said that for fear of not being able to explain it. After all, he had grown so much in a blink of an eye. No one would believe him if he said it. Hence, he decided to use the reason of elevator shoes to let others be used to his height. When people were accustomed to it, then there would not be a problem. Well, actually it was not something new for a person to grow 5cm overnight. At least in Zhang Ye\u2019s world, he had frequently heard of such miraculous things happening, such as waking up to realize that one had grown 6cm, or how family members heard his bones crackle at night while he was sleeping. When Zhang Ye heard of this, he was skeptical, but people growing tall overnight was indeed a fact. There were more than ten such cases in the world as examples, but the reasons were still unknown. Hence, Zhang Ye did not have any pressure. Even if others questioned him on this, he could use this as an excuse.\u201cLandlady Auntie, I\u2019ll tell you something.\u201d Zhang Ye told the good news, \u201cJust now, I was hired by the Beijing Television Station. I will be either a host or a guest after National Day.\u201dRao Aimin said, \u201cOh, you sure can create miracles in life. That can even happen?\u201dZhang Ye rolled his eyes, \u201cI\u2019m using my strength! Absolute strength!\u201d\u201cStop bragging.\u201d Rao Aimin laughed, \u201cChang\u2019e 4 just went up into space, and was taken down by your bragging!\u201dChenchen swallowed the celery in her mouth, \u201c\u2026Hur Hur.\u201dZhang Ye curled his mouth, \u201cKeep trampling on me. When I become famous, I\u2019ll let you open your eyes!\u201d After the meal, Zhang Ye was feeling bloated. He was too lazy to go home, \u201cLet me borrow your computer.\u201d\u201cGo home and use yours!\u201d Rao Aimin said impolitely.\u201cI can\u2019t even move. I\u2019m too bloated.\u201d Zhang Ye ignored her.Rao Aimin smacked her lips, \u201cIt\u2019s upstairs. Use it yourself.\u201d She went to wash the dishes.Zhang Ye clutched his belly as he walked upstairs with great difficulty into the landlady\u2019s bedroom. The moment that he opened the door, he was caught off-guard. A dazzling array of underwear and fall clothing assaulted his eyes. There were clothes of Big Sister Rao\u2019s on the bed. There were about 20-30 pieces. It was obvious without asking that Rao Aimin was clearing her closet in the afternoon. She was keeping her summer clothes and preparing to wash and dry her autumn clothes. But before she was done, she had to cook. Hence, there was a bunch of clothes left on the bed and balcony. This made Zhang Ye\u2019s heart race!Floral print dress.Hollow flesh-colored underwear.Black silk stockings with decorative patterns.There was white underwear that had just been taken off.Zhang Ye looked behind to make sure there was no one before closing the door. He could not help but pick up a few pieces of Rao Aimin\u2019s underwear and examine them before throwing them back. This Big Sister Rao was seriously too much. She was too careless. Forget it, let\u2019s look at my computer. Actually, just like Rao Aimin\u2019s vicious tongue, Zhang Ye was also slowly getting accustomed to Old Comrade Rao\u2019s careless demeanor. She had always been like that and never took heed about their difference in gender. But she had to be such a unkempt big sister, yet she made amazingly delicious food and was particular good at taking care of others.People were just so strange.At times, there were such contradicting amalgamations.Switching on the computer and going online, Zhang Ye was initially intending to check the current events and entertainment news. But he habitually first logged in to Weibo. He discovered that his poem had been posted online!\u201cLet me post a poem. I happened to hear it while chatting with a friend at the television station. The original author should be Zhang Ye.\u201d\u201cThe title is \u2018This is also Everything\u2019.\u201d\u201cNot every tree has been broken off by the storm.\u201d\u201cNot every seed cannot find soil to root.\u201dFinally he concluded, \u201cI was very excited after hearing it, so I posted it to share with everyone!\u201dZhang Ye looked at the discussion and messages below. It had already broken 1,000 views, and there were numerous messages!\u201cTeacher Zhang\u2019s new poem?\u201d\u201cHoly sh*t. I remember there\u2019s a poem called \u2018Everything\u2019, right?\u201d\u201cYes. It\u2019s \u2018Everything\u2019 written by Wang Shuixin. It even went in textbooks. This poem is clearly targeted at \u2018Everything\u2019, rejecting everything in it!\u201d\u201cHaha, this poem is so great!\u201d\u201cAs expected of face smacking master Zhang Ye\u2019s work!\u201d\u201cWow, everyone take a look quickly. Face smacking specialist, Teacher Zhang Ye has a new work!\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t say. This really is a smack in the face. Every line contradicts \u2018Everything\u2019! Teacher Wang Shuixin is probably crying! To encounter such a face smacking specialist!\u201d\u201cBut \u2018This is also Everything\u2019 is really much more suitable as a language education material than \u2018Everything\u2019. I pity Zhang Ye. Why can\u2019t such a good poet like him enter the Writers\u2019 Association? There is no official recognition of his position in literature.\u201d\u201c@BeijingWriters\u2019Association.\u201d\u201cWho told Teacher Zhang to trample on the people from the Writers\u2019 Association!?\u201d\u201cSupporting Teacher Zhang\u2019s entry into the Writers\u2019 Association. Or providence would not forgive!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. It doesn\u2019t make sense. Can the Beijing Writers\u2019 Association respond? Why isn\u2019t Teacher Zhang invited into the Association? Just because cultured people tend to scorn each other?\u201d\u201cSummoning the Beijing Writers\u2019 Association!\u201d\u201cTeacher Zhang is impressive! He has to enter the Writers\u2019 Association!\u201dEveryone stood in solidarity. Zhang Ye\u2019s works came one after another, and each one was more interesting and wonderful than the last. It made people feel disappointment that the Beijing Writers\u2019 Association did not have any response!But what Zhang Ye was most concerned about was his nickname and description!Face smacking specialist?Your sister\u2019s a face smacking specialist!Why is my nickname so terrible!?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When Rao Aimin returned back to her small duplex bedroom on the second floor, she pushed the door open and frowned. She began to keep the clothes on the bed, hanging them up, and those that could not be hung up were thrown into the washing machine. She turned back and said unkindly to Zhang Ye, \u201cYou, I\u2019m speaking to you. Look at the time. Quickly grab your stuff and get lost. It\u2019s time for Chenchen to sleep. Go back to wherever you came from!\u201dShe was wearing a very homelike sportswear. It looked old on her, and the colors did not look good. It was probably worn when she cooked.Zhang Ye glanced at her and said, \u201cOh, alright. I\u2019ll be done once I finish reading this.\u201dIt was news related to the first day\u2019s sales of \u201cGhost Blows Out the Light\u201d. Although there were no specific numbers, and the publisher firm had not made it public, by analyzing the numbers from various bookstores, there was only one conclusion, and that was that \u201cGhost Blows Out the Light\u201d had a craze-like sale. Except for a few large bookstores who had still one or two copies of \u201cGhost Blows Out the Light\u201d left, as they had a large inventory, the other smaller bookstores that ordered fewer copies were completely sold out!This was just the first day!The initial printing of \u201cGhost Blows Out the Light\u201d was just 100,000 for one volume, and 200,000 for two volumes!And almost half of it was already sold out? In recent years, very few books would have such crazy sales. They could be counted on one hand, not to mention a niche supernatural genre like \u201cGhost Blows Out the Light\u201d!After reading the news, Zhang Ye closed the page.At this moment, Chenchen was walking heavily up the stairs. She came and took a look at Zhang Ye. In her tiny pajamas, she slipped into bed.\u201cI\u2019m going, little rascal.\u201d Zhang Ye bade her farewell.Chenchen looked at him, \u201cZhang Ye, tell me a story.\u201dRao Aimin was done packing her clothes, and she said, \u201cYour Uncle Zhang needs to go home and sleep!\u201dChenchen ignored as she looked at him with silent big eyes, \u201cZhang Ye, tell me a story, or I won\u2019t be able to sleep. My aunt doesn\u2019t read me stories.\u201dRao Aimin mumbled, \u201cHow old are you to still want to listen to stories!\u201dChenchen reached out her tiny hand to grab Zhang Ye\u2019s big hand, as if she did not want him to leave.Zhang Ye had no other choice but to sit on the bed. Seeking the opinion of the landlady, \u201cThen I\u2019ll tell Chenchen a story?\u201d\u201cRead it, then. I\u2019ll go shower.\u201d Rao Aimin did not care and went into the bathroom and closed the door. A moment later, the sound of flowing water could be heard. Maybe she was feeling the comfort of showering, which resulted in the whistling sounds of Rao Aimin coming out of the bathroom.\u201cZhang Ye!\u201d Seeing him wandering with his mind, Chenchen called out very unhappily.\u201cOh. Oh, alright.\u201d Zhang Ye asked, \u201cHave you heard my fairy tales? Which ones have you listened to?\u201d\u201cOur school has read your \u2018Little Bunnies Be Good\u2019 and \u2018Snow White and the Seven Dwarves\u2019.\u201d Chenchen closed her eyes as she lay in bed.\u201cAlright, then. I\u2019ll read you \u2018The Wizard of Oz\u2019.\u201d Zhang Ye began reading. After speaking for so long, he also ended up tired. He ended up lying on the perimeter of the bed, with his shoes off and the blanket over him, as he carried on narrating to Chenchen.However, this little thing got more spirited the more she heard. Her large eyes grew brighter, and all the sleepiness had disappeared from her eyes.The landlady had finished her shower and, seeing that Zhang Ye was not gone, she looked at him, \u201cStill reading?\u201dZhang Ye gave a wry smile, \u201cShe doesn\u2019t want to sleep.\u201dChenchen insisted, \u201cI still want to listen.\u201dZhang Ye said, \u201cLet\u2019s do it tomorrow. I\u2019ll read to you tomorrow.\u201d\u201cNo, I must listen to it today.\u201d Chenchen said, \u201cWe don\u2019t have classes on National Day. I can sleep later.\u201dRao Aimin may look like the devil daily who stops people and grumble daily, but whoever had long exposure to her would realize that she was a very careful and soft-hearted big sister. \u201cThis child is so disobedient. Let\u2019s see when this aunt of yours will beat you up one day.\u201d After saying these ruthless words, she added on, \u201cAlright, alright, keep listening.\u201d Then she said to Zhang Ye, \u201cLittle Zhang, I\u2019m not going to care about you. I\u2019m tired, so I\u2019ll sleep first.\u201d\u201cUh, alright.\u201d Zhang Ye said.Rao Aimin tightened the towel on her body and went to the other side of the bed and slipped into it. Then she turned with her back facing them, \u201cKeep it down. Don\u2019t disturb me.\u201dChenchen said like a small adult, \u201cSleep then. Cover your blanket well. Good night, Aunt.\u201dThere were three people in bed. Thankfully, the landlady\u2019s house was big, and her bed was big, too. It was not crowded at all. Now, Zhang Ye and Rao Aimin took up both sides of the bed, with Chenchen in the middle. This scene looked like a family, making Zhang Ye feel some warmth.\u201cZhang Ye,\u201d Chenchen said softly.Zhang Ye then said, \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll carry on.\u201dHe read from 9:30 to 10, and then from 10 to 10:30.When it was nearly 11, Rao Aimin turned around in a sleepy daze in an annoyed fashion, \u201cWhy are you still reading the story? Quick sleep!\u201dChenchen did not answer, for she was already sound asleep.Only then did Zhang Ye notice. He was also extremely tired. He was too lazy to make a move, so he just slept where he was in the bed.\u2026Note: The following parts and the next chapter have been\u00a0retconned\u00a0by the author. The part after this is supposed to be rewritten by the author, but he has not done so. It is provided as is. However, note that the events can be considered as filler.The next day.The morning of the second day of National Day.There were a lot of sparrows here, so they began chirping the moment the day broke.The soundly sleeping Zhang Ye felt hot, so he kicked the blanket off him, then he turned sideways to find a comfortable position. He even lifted his legs over. He had the habit of hugging his blanket in his sleep.Oh?Why was there the scent of a woman?And it was the special body smell of a mature woman?Zhang Ye was a bit more awake, and he finally recalled that he did not sleep at home last night. Hence, he opened his eyes to take a look and was covered in sweat!This was the landlady auntie?Man! Why am I cuddling her!?Zhang Ye was still wondering why he could feel the touch of flesh on both his hands and legs. Chenchen had somehow crept to the end of the bed, and was near Zhang Ye\u2019s feet. Without any barrier in between him and Rao Aimin, Zhang Ye might have not been a honest sleeper, for he had snuck towards Big Sister Rao!Rao Aimin was still sleeping, but after a night of tossing and turning, the red towel on her body had unwrapped. Most of her shoulder was revealed. Her thigh was just barely covered by the towel, concealing the most critical region. The remaining two firm long legs were left revealed outside. He could see a tiny trace of flesh-colored cotton underwear on her right most side. Clearly, this was revealed when Zhang Ye kicked the blanket previously. The three people were in bed, but now, Big Sister Rao had been exposed!And it was not only that!The scene gave too much information!Zhang Ye\u2019s legs were lifted above Rao Aimin\u2019s buttocks. Her knees were fixed there and his knees moved floated up and down as Big Sister Rao\u2019s body breathed. What was most worth mentioning was Zhang Ye\u2019s hand. This pair of unlucky hands had happened to snuck into Rao Aimin\u2019s towel when he turned his body. His hands were located very close to her chest. Zhang Ye had never really touched females before, so he was not sure what the feeling was on his hands. He was not sure if he had touched things he should not have touched!Things were not good!Zhang Ye\u2019s sweat began streaming down his head. He did not dare to stay a second longer, nor did he dare to appreciate the soft touch. He quickly pulled his hand out a bit.But this made Rao Aimin wake up!It\u2019s over!Bad things are going to happen!Zhang Ye\u2019s face was green. He recalled the glorious deed of Rao Aimin beating up the two young renters in the past. Big Sister Rao was a powerhouse in the entire small district. Who wouldn\u2019t know this story? \u201cWoman challenges two hooligans. Hooligans beaten up badly.\u201d was even the title of the article that had appeared on some small unknown newspaper! Rao Aimin had gotten fame from that one fight. Her fighting prowess was well known by everyone in the small district.At this moment, Zhang Ye suddenly recalled his home country, recalling the parents he left behind in the far countryside. He recalled of his long lost child\u2026 Alright, it was just an artistic exaggeration.Anyway, he was just scared out of his wits!Zhang Ye remained motionless, hoping for a miracle to appear. He hoped Rao Aimin would not realize it and would go back to sleep.But Rao Aimin was still awake. Zhang Ye was already prepared to get beaten, but\u2026 The development was completely different from what he thought!\u201cOh?\u201d Rao Aimin uttered.Zhang Ye did not dare breathe. His hands were still by her chest, and his leg was still on her hips.Rao Aimin smacked her lips, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dZhang Ye did not know how to answer, so he did not speak.\u201cDon\u2019t go around touching and sleep.\u201d Rao Aimin reprimanded with a sentence.Zhang Ye\u2019s body had been tightened, awaiting the fury of the landlady, but he never expected those words. What did it mean? Why didn\u2019t you beat me up? Why were you so calm?Rao Aimin turned around, and her back faced him. The towel on her body slipped even more. Now her entire smooth back was revealed. She carried on sleeping.When she rolled over, Zhang Ye\u2019s hand had also slid off from her body, and fell onto her waist.Zhang Ye\u2019s heart was beating, but he was also emboldened. This time, he began touching on purpose. He was moving his palm on the landlady\u2019s waist!Flesh!The feeling was really good!Rao Aimin remained motionless, but she said, \u201cSleep. Stop messing around. I\u2019m sleepy.\u201dShe was still not mad? Zhang Ye was excited as he emboldened himself further. He knew such an opportunity did not befall him usually. He slipped his hand downwards and touched the landlady\u2019s thigh. At first, he did not dare to move much, but after observing Rao Aimin\u2019s reaction, he noticed that Rao Aimin did not say a word this time. As if he was given permission to continue, Zhang Ye shifted his body closer, sticking himself to Big Sister Rao\u2019s body. Then he began to carefully touch her!What about below?What should he do next?Zhang Ye did not know. He had no experience in this at all!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 99": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I\u2019m Really a SuperstarCH 98Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 98: The Landlady\u2019s LossIn the bedroom.A picturesque scene.The landlady did not make any obvious rejection, and didn\u2019t even reprimand him with any harsh words, so Zhang Ye did not stand on ceremony. He used the principle of \u201cyou are an idiot not to take advantage\u201d to explore the landlady. Zhang Ye, who was a person who had never had a relationship before, obviously had never experienced such a scene. He could only move steadily. This ambiguous atmosphere made Zhang Ye agitated. He felt like his entire body was almost melted by the landlady\u2019s flesh and mature body scent!This was a memorable occasion that made Zhang Ye want to give a song of love.You are my little, dear little apple*!Lighting my life\u2019s fire fire fire fire fire!Forget it, it spoils the atmosphere a bit. It\u2019s best not to sing it!Anyway, Zhang Ye was now feeling very daring. He felt life was pleasant.But when Zhang Ye wanted to change his position, with his palm preparing to attack the landlady\u2019s seductive ass, Rao Chenchen suddenly woke up!The little rascal said in a daze, \u201cAunt, I\u2019m hungry!\u201dThe landlady said gracefully, \u201cGot it.\u201d\u201cAunt, I\u2019m hungry.\u201d The little rascal constantly nagged with her eyes closed. \u201cI\u2019m hungry. I\u2019m hungry.\u201dSuddenly, Rao Aimin was awake. Her body suddenly stretched and in a blink of an eye threw away Zhang Ye\u2019s unmannerly hands!Before Zhang Ye could even react, his wrist was pinched by Rao Aimin!His eyes went blurry and his head went dizzy. Zhang Ye had no idea what had happened. He only felt the world spinning, and even the ceiling and the ceiling lights and pictures on the wall had flashed past him. Then, his ass was thrown off the bed. Only then did he feel the intense pain!\u201cAiyah, hey!\u201d Zhang Ye screamed.Rao Aimin looked at him from the bed, \u201cSo it was you! What were you doing on the bed!?\u201dAs Zhang Ye moaned, he said, \u201cOf course I\u2019m there. Ah, wasn\u2019t I telling stories to Chenchen yesterday. I was also sleepy and then I fell asleep!\u201dRao Aimin stared at him, \u201cThen what were you touching me for!\u201dZhang Ye was dumbfounded, \u201cYou did not know I was around?\u201dHe finally understood. Damn, the landlady had not quietly allowed him to take advantage of her, but it was because she had been sleeping with little Chenchen these past few days, so she had treated him as Chenchen? She thought the person touching her was her niece? Hence, she said, \u201cStop messing around.\u201d? Just now, when Chenchen shouted that she was hungry, the voice came from the other side of the bed. Only then did Rao Aimin realize? And then threw Zhang Ye off the bed!It was a misunderstanding!Your sister, it was a big misunderstanding!Zhang Ye felt like crying his heart out. He laid on the ground, without being able to get up. It was too painful. He didn\u2019t even know what had happened. He had been thrown off the bed with a single hand of the landlady. Big Sister Rao! Goddess Rao! How much strength do you have? You did a over-shoulder throw with one hand? That was too crazy! But since Zhang Ye was initially the one at fault, he could only be the first to complain despite being the one to offend. He lain on the ground screaming, \u201cI can\u2019t take it anymore! Aiyah! I\u2019m dying! My waist has broken! I can\u2019t take it anymore!\u201dRao Aimin glanced at him, \u201cWho let you grope!? Fine, stop screaming. Treat it as I mistakenly overused my strength!\u201dZhang Ye was embarrassed, so he shouted even louder, \u201cOh, my elbows! Aiyah, my knee! Aiyah, my disc!\u201d It was quite a catchy phrase.Rao Aimin wrapped the towel on her body again, then stepped off the bed with her bare feet. She squatted down and touched his elbow, \u201cIs there pain here?\u201dZhang Ye said, \u201cIt\u2019s not painful here.\u201d\u201cWhat about here?\u201d Rao Aimin examined his knee.\u201cAh, it\u2019s not painful here, too,\u201d Zhang Ye said.\u201cWhat about here?\u201d Rao Aimin pressed on his intervertebral disc.\u201cAlso not painful,\u201d Zhang Ye said.Rao Aimin kicked him in the ass with an unhappy face, \u201cDamn kid, if it\u2019s not painful, why are you screaming? Quickly get up. It\u2019s no big deal!\u201dZhang Ye\u2019s screams became worse, \u201cI can\u2019t get up, I can\u2019t move!\u201dRao Aimin curled her mouth and stretched her arm underneath his waist. And like she was lifting a bag of rice, she threw Zhang Ye onto the bed. It was unknown if she knew traditional Chinese medicine, as Rao Aimin checked his pulse. She then firmly said, \u201cIt\u2019s alright. You just have some muscle injury. Lie down. I\u2019ll give you some medicine!\u201d Turning towards Chenchen, she said, \u201cBring my medicine box over. It\u2019s at the bottom of the cabinet.\u201dChenchen gave a nonchalant, \u201cOh.\u201d and went to take it.Zhang Ye was still shocked that he had been thrown by Rao Aimin with one arm, \u201cLandlady \u00a0Auntie, have you practiced kungfu before?\u201d\u201cWhy do you care?\u201d\u201cThen why are you so powerful?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t mind my business.\u201d\u201c\u2026Oh.\u201d Zhang Ye did not ask again.With the medicine box brought over, Rao Aimin took a bottle of safflower oil. It was one of those especially old bottles. Right, it was like those sesame oil bottles.\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Zhang Ye complained, \u201cWill it work?\u201d\u201cAre you just full of nonsense? Lie down and stay still!\u201d Rao Aimin pricked him with a sentence. She then spread the safflower oil on him and massaged him, \u201cTell me where it hurts!\u201dAfter seeing this, Chenchen went downstairs. She was probably too hungry, so she went searching for food.After rubbing him a few times, Rao Aimin went onto the bed with her bare feet. It was likely because her pose was not conducive for her to use her strength, and it was also uncomfortable. She crouched beside Zhang Ye\u2019s side and massaged his back. This allowed her to use more strength.\u201cIt\u2019s painful here, it\u2019s painful here!\u201d\u201cGot it.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s painful here, too!\u201d\u201c\u2026Alright. Bear with it.\u201dRao Aimin must have definitely learned before, for her technique was very good. She was more professional than a professional.Zhang Ye\u2019s pain was slowly alleviated. What replaced it was more and more pleasure. It felt so good! It was too comfortable! Zhang Ye enjoyed it while closing his eyes!\u201cStill painful?\u201d\u201cPainful.\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t you look like you are suffering to me?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s especially painful!\u201dRao Aimin did not say anything more. She carried on massaging his back and thigh. She even grabbed his ass and gave him an angular massage.Suddenly, Zhang Ye turned his head and saw a flowery scene. As the landlady was crouching on the bed and her body was wrapped in a towel, the opening to the towel by her thighs was undefended. As Zhang Ye\u2019s position was low, so he could clearly see what was underneath! As he was afraid the landlady would discover it, Zhang Ye did not dare to keep looking. He looked away, but after waiting a while, he turned his head to sneak a peek.Ten minutes later.Rao Aimin patted his ass, \u201cAlright, it\u2019s done.\u201dZhang Ye sat up and stretched, \u201cWhy do I still feel sore?\u201d\u201cOf course. You should be happy that it was just a simple muscle pull after being thrown be me. If I had really went all out, it would be a light injury if you forearms and calves were only fractured.\u201d Rao Aimin chased him off the bed, \u201cHurry up and get lost. Be more honest when you sleep and don\u2019t go groping around!\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t eaten breakfast.\u201d Zhang Ye looked at her.\u201cNone! Go home and make your own!\u201d Rao Aimin said.Zhang Ye could only hobble downstairs to return to his home.Yes, this is the end of the chapter. Why? You asked why the title is called \u201cThe Landlady\u2019s Loss\u201d? Alright, it\u2019s because I wrote the wrong word. The title should be \u201cThe Landlady\u2019s Mistake\u201d!Hai, actually, it\u2019s about the same.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 100": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I\u2019m Really a SuperstarCH 99Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 99: The Five Million Copyright Fee has been Banked In!Home.After returning from the landlady\u2019s house in the morning, Zhang Ye crashed back into bed. There was nothing he could do about it. Rao Aimin\u2019s throw had caused him to go into a daze. He had still not recovered from it. Of course, the landlady was not easily taken advantage of. He had been taught a lesson, a bloody lesson!Beep, beep. A short message was received.Zhang Ye twisted his arm while feeling the pain and tapped on the phone. However, the next moment, he could not be calm. His waist did not ache, and his legs were no longer painful!It was a notification from the bank!He had received the copyright fees! There was more than five million Yuan!Excluding taxes, this was the amount Zhang Ye received for selling \u201cGhost Blows Out the Light\u201d and several of his fairy tale stories!His cellphone vibrated. A call was coming in. It was a call from the man from the Beijing Education Publishing Firm, \u201cHello, Teacher Little Zhang. Haha, did you received the royalty fees? Congratulations! The sales for \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019 yesterday was a huge success. No, I should say it was an unprecedented success! In all these years, our publishing firm had never, besides non-commercial publications, had a first day sales record of 90,000 copies!\u201d He was very excited, \u201cTo be working with you, it is our honour. All along the way, you have been a man of miracles!\u201dZhang Ye laughed, \u201cYou are generous with your praises, I\u2019m not that great. It\u2019s great due to your sales promotions.\u201d\u201cBut this sales figure is certain to decline; it won\u2019t be able to hold at such high numbers going forward. Our most conservative estimates say that we will hit at least 700,000 copies per series this year. The next year estimates will likely increase very little, but we will still reprint. I think that with time, to break through a million copies sales per series should not be a problem at all.\u201d said the middle-aged man excitedly.This sales figure was also within Zhang Ye\u2019s own estimates. It wasn\u2019t too much of a surprise to him, \u201cHow about the fairy tale stories?\u201dThe middle aged man reported happily, \u201cWe have already started on the promotions. When some of the bookstores and web stores knew that we were going to publish a compilation of \u201cSnow White\u201d, \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d and other fairy tales, many of them approached us to make pre-orders. The pre-order figures are already over 30,000. We have also put a priority on this publication. The firm\u2019s Leader has already decided to speed up the publication of your fairy tales for release in a short time!\u201dThey hung up.Zhang Ye was still a little worried, so he went online to check his bank account. There was indeed 5 million more in his account. This large amount of money made Zhang Ye dizzy. When had he ever seen so much money?I\u2019m rich!Time to buy a house and car!Zhang Ye first thoughts were to buy a 3 bedroom apartment within the 2nd Ring Road of Beijing City. Then what next? Then what\u2019s left to buy? Cough, cough\u2026 All you can buy is a fart, because you still have to pay it in installments after that! 5 million and you want to buy a 3 bedroom apartment within the 2nd Ring Road of Beijing City? That is something that would only happen in the New York Times and the Washington Post!At once, Zhang Ye opened up Weibo to interact with his followers. This was an activity that he liked doing very much recently because his followers had increased to around 89,000 odd people. He had found out that he could increase his Reputation this way, too. As long as he posted something interesting or something that left them in admiration, he would gain a certain amount of Reputation. Afterall, this was also a form of social media, not unlike that of a radio or TV station.After posting: Received the royalty fees, but after doing some calculations, I\u2019m still far from buying a house. Forget it; I won\u2019t be buying one after all.Unsure if ZhangYeNumber1Fan had been on standby for Zhang Ye the whole day, immediately after it was posted, the first to forward and comment on it was him, \u201cThat can\u2019t be? Teacher Zhang also cannot afford a house?\u201d\u201cHow much is the royalty fee? Requesting for insider news!\u201d\u201cDefinitely on the level of a million. \u2018Ghost Blows Out the Light\u2019 is too hot!\u201d\u201cHow can it be just a million? It has to be a least a few millions to do justice to a work like this!\u201d\u201cHaha, Teacher Zhang is deliberately playing dumb again. But honestly, property prices are getting expensive. I doubt I will ever be able to afford one in my lifetime. I can only afford to rent.\u201dEveryone was busy discussing.Suddenly, a nasty comment appeared, \u201cIs this Zhang Ye retarded? How are property prices expensive? It\u2019s cheap enough. If you can\u2019t afford it, it\u2019s because you are useless. Don\u2019t complain. Even though I can\u2019t afford one myself, the people around me have all bought one and have paid in full. And they\u2019re even in the top-tier cities!\u201dThis poster was nicknamed \u201cI\u2019mTheBest\u201d.Someone below replied, \u201cAre you for real? Paid in full? Top-tier city?\u201d\u201cI\u2019mTheBest\u201d replied \u201cOf course. Those are even houses in the city. It\u2019s not difficult!\u201d\u201cLaughable.\u201d Someone retorted, \u201cDo you even know how much property prices are right now? Don\u2019t you watch the news?\u201dZhangYeNumber1Fan was speechless, \u201cThis person watches the news, but I bet it\u2019s Xinwen Lianbo.\u201d (considered to be a government inclined news outlet)!\u201dAfter following Zhang Ye\u2019s Weibo, many of these followers were \u201cfighters\u201d. This challenge had provoked a war. Everyone was now arguing!All of these comments were posted under Zhang Ye\u2019s Weibo post, so, of course, he felt helpless and irritated. Scolding me? Even saying property prices are cheap? So he followed up with a post \u201cEveryone, don\u2019t argue. Actually, \u2018I\u2019mTheBest\u2019 has a point there. I also know a friend who paid in full for a house in a top-tier city, too. It\u2019s not impossible. You can still work for others and be able to afford a so-called luxury home. This is not an impossible dream.\u201d\u201cAn employee can afford a luxury home?\u201d\u201cHow\u2019s that possible!\u201d\u201cEh? Why is Teacher Zhang talking for that guy?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s can\u2019t be any logic in this? Even a fool knows how high property prices are!\u201d\u201cTeacher Zhang\u2019s gone crazy today, right?\u201dThe masses were now questioning Zhang Ye. Some of their comments were very nasty.Zhang Ye replied, seemingly unaffected \u201cListen to my friend\u2019s story first.\u201d He had randomly remembered a very popular story from his old world.\u201cTell us!\u201d\u201cHow is this not bullshit!\u201d\u201cI would like to see how you explain yourself out of this!\u201dA lot of people began to talk down to him.Zhang Ye posted \u201cFive years ago, my friend Xiaoke ran into walls when he was seeking employment. In the end, he found a job as a small-time programmer in a small IT company in Beijing. After half a year, Xiaoke felt that he could not continue on like this anymore and came up with a plan to buy a house within five years. Every step was carefully planned and followed! \u2018At first, it was really difficult. I could not do any social or entertainment activities.\u2019 Xiaoke related. \u2018From the start, I used any free time from work to study financial planning and programming courses to increase my knowledge.\u2019 Just like that, Xiaoke took all sorts of IT certification exams and got his company to give him yearly raises in increments of 3%. \u2018I even applied for management courses and got to know many outstanding industry people.\u2019 Using such networking, Xiaoke slowly built up his contacts. Finally, with the five years of accumulated savings of 50,000, adding on the 7.95 million that his parents gave to him, Xiaoke managed to buy his first ever house. It\u2019s even a house in Beijing City\u2019s 2nd Ring Road area. \u2018Having a dream that can be turned into reality is the most beautiful.\u2019 said Xiaoke with determination in his eyes.\u201dAt first, everyone was still seriously reading, trying to understand Xiaoke\u2019s miraculous plan to buy a house and learn from it. But when the story ended, everyone passed out!\u201cPu!\u201d\u201cHahaha!\u201d\u201cThat was a godly reversal!\u201d\u201cThis is definitely Teacher Zhang\u2019s style!\u201d\u201cTeacher Zhang is too cute! That was such a tease!\u201d\u201cThis is what a master is. A short story can be written with such sarcasm and depth!\u201d\u201cTurns out to be ironic! I had thought that Teacher Zhang went crazy! I quickly apologize! I\u2019m ashamed to have treated Teacher Zhang wrongly! I will definitely support you in the future!\u201d\u201cThis story has written out our voices and frustrations!\u201d\u201cThis is what a writer should be, at least to me. Look at Teacher Zhang; he can write modern poetry, ancient melody poetry, novels, fairy tales and even such thought provoking and humorous short stories. The Beijing Writers\u2019 Association must be blind. Are you sure that you won\u2019t be admitting Teacher Zhang Ye into the association?\u201dThis story had actually been so overused back in Zhang Ye\u2019s old world. If you surf the internet often enough, you\u2019d have heard of this story before. But it has never appeared in this world before, so everyone\u2019s curiosity was piqued and they laughed so hard at it. Then came the forwarding and dissemination of the story!A simple short story like that had now been voted to rank 9 of the main page!An explosive viral effect had been achieved within such a short time!This also made Zhang Ye secretly shocked. The power of the masses was indeed great. The number of Weibo fans and his Reputation points were both increasing! It seemed like he had to do such things more often in the future. He could not give up any opportunity to be famous. His goal was to be the world\u2019s number one superstar, so naturally, he had to grab every opportunity. No matter how small a mosquito was, it was still flesh. If he could go onto the front page of Weibo or make the headlines, it would greatly increase his popularity. And the poems, novels, passages and essays in Zhang Ye\u2019s mind were what he relied on greatly. He was not lacking in knowledge!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
