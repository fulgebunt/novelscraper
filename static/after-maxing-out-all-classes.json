    "Chapter 1": "Chapter 1: Being an Adventure is boring. I just want to be lazyA large green-skinned dragon flew over the pine forest, bringing with it a gust of wind that caused the pine forests to sway and the pinecones to rustle.Robb was sitting under a pine tree while looking at the bulging belly of the two-footed flying dragons flying over the treetops, thinking to himself, \u201cI am now a \u2018God Archer\u2019. Using the skill \u2018Dragon Killing Arrow\u2019, I can shoot dragons from the sky with one arrow. Then, I can equip a skinning knife and using the \u2018Advanced Skinning Skill\u2019, I can get the item \u2018Dragon Skin\u2019, then, using the \u2018Advanced Skinning Skill\u2019 again, I can make a pair of \u2018Flying Dragon Leather Armor\u2019. In this way, the proficiency of archery will increase by 5 points, the proficiency of skinning will increase by 2 points, and the proficiency of leather crafting will increase by 2 points\u2026.\u201dWhile thinking about this, he suddenly raised his hand and slapped himself. \u201cWhat are you thinking about again? You\u2019ve already practiced. You don\u2019t need to practice anymore.\u201dRobb, who is 18 years old this year, is a senior gamer. A few years prior, he became fascinated by \u201cDark Blade\u201d. \u201cDark Blade\u201d is a large-scale online RPG known as an MMORPG (TL: Massively Multiplayer Online Role-playing Games). It is set in a Western world full of swords and magic, with a vast and seamless world map, rich monsters, and numerous occupations. It allowed players to freely change full-time and part-time jobs, with rich customization that enabled the players to DIY their beloved game characters as they like.Robb fell into the game by accident. Maybe it was because he was a Virgo, but he always played the game to completion. To do otherwise left him feeling uncomfortable. Warriors, Paladins, Rangers, Rogues, Priests... He ran through all other common occupations in its entirety. He even fully practiced mining, tree cutting, cooking, skinning, leather making... and other skills.He established the largest guild in the entire server, defeated the most difficult of dungeons, defeated the strongest of epic-level monsters alone, and participated in a thousand-player raid.However, one day, when he logged into the game, he discovered that there was nothing left for him to do.Everything that can be experienced has been experienced by him.The world of swords and magic completely lost the attraction he once had when he first arrived. At this point, when he logged into the game world, he didn\u2019t even feel the slightest bit of excitement.Well, this may just be the ultimate destination for all gamers.He decided to quit the game. However, at that moment, he somehow transmigrated over and sat under a pine tree. He appears to look the same as the appearance of his own game character. He\u2019s a handsome blonde male, wearing a T-shirt and jeans made with skin bought with krypton gold. He also inherited all proficiency points he gained and developed in the game.He met an explorer and asked him some questions. He learned that this place is called the \u201cFengmo Continent\u201d, a world of swords and magic; however, it isn\u2019t a game world but a real world.Either way, no matter what it\u2019s called, whether real or not, he\u2019s already tired of everything about swords and magic. Seeing a goblin poking his head next to him, he didn\u2019t even bother to fight it. When he changed his previous career and had not yet fully practiced and developed it, whenever he encountered a monster with a delicate and soft body like a goblin, he would rush over and chop it up immediately so he could obtain one or two points of proficiency.However, what should I do if I don\u2019t want to move at all?I just arrived in a new world, but why do I have no interest in exploring?He looked at the sky and fell into a state of inactivity.At this moment, a voice sounded in the distance, and three people came over from the woods.Walking in front was a man in heavy armor carrying a big sword; behind him was a man in leather armor armed with a bow and arrow; and at the back was a woman in a robe holding a wand. The woman was pretty good-looking, with delicate facial features and red hair.This is an authentic adventurer\u2019s squad! They have a warrior, an archer, and a magician. Except for the lack of a priest, the overall structure of their squad is very reasonable.Of course, Robb also knows that only in the game can there be a clear occupation. In the real world, a farmer who picks up a sword Is a warrior, who picks up a bow is an archer, and if he learns magic, he can become a magician. Here, there is no reason to hang a certain job name on one\u2019s head, and there is no concept of experience points and levels.So, in the real world, you don\u2019t know what skills someone will use just by looking at them. Maybe a person with a staff will pick up a dagger and backstab you the next second. This is the norm here in the real world.This small group seemed to be very cautious. They took each step they took in the wood carefully. When they entered the pine forest, they saw Robb sitting under the tree. Unarmed and wearing a strange piece of cloth. He didn\u2019t look dangerous, and the warrior in front asked, \u201dHey! Are you a resident of Westwind Town? Isn\u2019t it dangerous for you to come here alone?\u201dRobb wanted to save the trouble and didn\u2019t want to talk too much with strangers, so he just lied casually, \u201cI just went into the mountains to collect herbs; although it\u2019s a little dangerous, wealth and danger come hand in hand.\u201d\u201cIt turns out to be herbs.\u201d The warrior in front then asked, \u201cDid you see a green-skinned wyvern around here? It often attacks the caravan, and the elders of Westwind Town asked us to get rid of it.\u201d\u201cOh? Is it a flying dragon?\u201d Robb really saw a flying dragon just now and was even thinking about using its skin as leather armor, he pointed in the direction where the flying dragon disappeared and said, \u201cIt just passed from me. It flew overhead and headed in that direction. I saw that it flew slowly with a low altitude. It seemed that it was about to return to its nest. Its nest shouldn\u2019t be far from here.\u201dThe warrior smiled and said, \u201cGreat, we\u2019ve been looking for it for a few days, and now we finally have new about the wyvern.\u201d He turned around and smiled at the archer and magician and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go and kill it, so we can go back and get ourselves paid.\u201dThe three nodded to Robb and said thankfully, \u201cThank you for the information.\u201dRobb spread his hands and said, \u201cYou\u2019re welcome!\u201dThe three people left, but Robb didn\u2019t care. When playing games before, when other players asked him, \u201cWhere is the NPC for a certain task\u201d, he usually pointed out the location of the NPC casually before ignoring it. He was not so enthusiastic as to accompany them on a task whenever he was asked for directions.He continued to sit under the big pine tree, lazily thinking about what he should do.I don\u2019t want to explore the world anymore. I\u2019m not interested and don\u2019t want t pick up any s*** quests or fight s*** monsters. He has done these things repeatedly in the game for several years until he practiced all occupations and skills to perfection. Tired to the point of vomiting, thinking about it carefully, it is stupid how ridiculous it is that I have been picking up tasks, then going to do ten tasks to blame this stupid thing for several years.It\u2019s better to be lazy than to do this stupid thing.However, it is not enough to be lazy all the time.He needs to eat, sleep, and wear clothes in the real world. It seems he is not allowed to sit under the pine tree in a daze.He stood up slowly, thinking, \u201cThe first thing I should do now is to find a town where humans live? I have to find out what to eat and where to sleep first.\u201dAt this moment, a violent roar suddenly sounded in the distance, it sounded like the voice of a flying dragon, and then a huge explosion sounded; this time, it was the sound of flame explosion magic.Robb looked for where the sound came from, and a large first burst into the sky.Then, the double-legged flying dragon I had seen just now flew into the air, rapidly spinning mid-air. Several arrows flew up from the ground, but they were all dodged by it or beaten down by its wings. Then, it roared and rushed down to the ground.\u201cOh? It seems that the three people just fought with the double-legged dragon?\u201dRobb has already seen this kind of thing a lot. Walking around in the game, he often sees squads formed by players to fight against small bosses living in the wild. He really isn\u2019t interested in getting involved.However, now he needs to find a town where humans live to find food and a place to live. Rather than searching blindly, he might as well ask those three people.The warrior seems to have asked him earlier if he was a resident of Westwind Town, which, thinking about it the other way around, is there a nearby town called Westwind Town. So, I can just ask how they get to Westwind Town.Robb took a big step forward and walked towards the direction where the three were fighting with the flying dragon.TL: I'm new to translating, so I'm up for suggestions.

    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2: You are actually a priestThe battle had already been going on for a while when Robb arrived at the battle site.Several arrows have been inserted into the body of the two-legged flying dragon with traces of having been scorched by magic on its body. On the side of the adventurer's team, the shield held by the warrior is already deformed and seems to have been used a lot during the fight. The impacts have caused the shield's surface to become uneven. The warrior's armor's skirt had been torn off, and his thighs were covered with the color red, with his trousers completely dyed red.The archer isn\u2019t doing any better either, with a deep claw wound on his shoulder.However, the most miserable among the adventurer's group members should be the red-haired female magician. The back of her clothes has been torn apart, and three deep claw wounds can be seen on her snow-white back skin. The blood-stained her robe and her face. Her face has become pale to the point where it seems like she might fall down at any time. However, she mustn't fall now, or her life will be forfeit, and she'll receive a \"Bad End\" as soon as she falls! At this point, she can only grit her teeth and try to defeat the two-legged dragon before she falls.Fighting Hard!Robb thought, \"Should I help them kill the dragon?\"He only needs one move if he makes a move, and the medium-level monster, like the two-legged dragon, is dead. It would be effortless to do such a thing, but it will also be easy to cause disputes.For instance, back in the game world, when a high-level player sees a group of low-level players trying to defeat monsters. He walks over, casually takes the monster down, and gets the final blow, which will give him all the loot and money. (The game that the protagonist used to play gives everything to the one who gets the last hit, to whom all the monster experiences and drops go)Such unethical and insensitive behavior!Those low-level players fought hard but with no return, and the mission wasn't even completed. Of course, they'd get angry. They turned around and yelled at the player who stole the kill, \u201cThe monster who stole your mother!\u201d And then they\u2019ll chase and scold each other for an entire hour.Of course, in the real world, there aren't really any problems in robbing the experience points and monster corpse by last hitting. Such worry is unnecessary, but rashly stealing someone else's prey can easily cause misunderstandings. If the adventurers' guild in this world has any weird rules, who owns the monsters of those who kill?Robb holds his hands and asks the adventurer party, \"You three, can I ask a question? How can I get to the nearest town here?\"The three adventurers had no time to answer his question. The warrior stared at the two-legged flying dragon with a sword and a shield in hand. The female magician was also preparing her magic. Only the archer turned her head his way and said with haste, \"I'm busy right now. Stand further and don't get involved.\"Robb shrugged and said, \"Well, you guys do look very busy. I'll wait for a moment.\"\"Loki, the God of Flames, please listen to my request\u2026.\" The female magician endured the pain in her back, chanting a magic spell. But the two-legged dragon has wisdom, and when it heard the mage chanting, it immediately roared and rushed toward the female magician.The warrior quickly raised his crooked shield and stepped in front of her.With a loud bang, the warrior was knocked out.\"\u2026 Lend me the power of fire temporarily\u2026 Fire Explosion!\" The female magician finally completed her magic, and a fireball flew out from the tip of her staff and hit the wings of the flying dragon with two feet fiercely.\" With a bang, the fireball exploded, and a large amount of flame magic power hit the two-legged dragon.The two-legged dragon uttered a miserable hiss but still didn't fall down. It waved its wing and wept away the female magician. She grunted and flew straight sideways.She didn't have a shield or armor to protect her body like a warrior. The impact was heavy, and Robb even heard the sound of a broken should and arm.The female magician slammed and fell right in front of Robb, spouting a mouthful of blood, and couldn\u2019t get up anymore.\u201dThe warrior shouted, \"Jike, look at how Xuelu is doing!\u201dIt turns out the archer is called Jike. He shot three arrows in a row and forced the two-legged dragon to fly into the sky. He then jumped towards the female magician. The female magician named Xuelu had her entire arm twisted and deformed. It seemed that it was fractured, and it is clear that she couldn't fight anymore.He couldn't help crying, \"Oh my God! Xuelu is so badly injured that she can't fight anymore. We have to withdraw quickly and find a priest for her to treat her injuries, otherwise, her arm will be gone.\"\u201cDamn it! We have to give up the commission.\u201d\"Beware of the dragon\u2026.\"When the two of them were talking about this, the two-legged dragon jumped over. The warrior hurried up while the archer hastily released an arrow. There was no time to take care of it. They lost the back-line support of a magician, and the two of them had to somehow deal with it. The two-legged flying dragon is having a harder time and is already thinking about how to withdraw.At this moment, Robb, who had been watching by the side, squatted down beside Xuelu and told her, \u201cMiss, I never mix in other people\u2019s fights indiscriminately, so to avoid being affected, but you are seriously injured now. I think I should help you take a bite out of basic MMO etiquette. Do you mind?\"\u201cWhat\u2026what MMO etiquette\u2026 what bite?\u201d Xuelu didn\u2019t understand what Robb was talking about.Robb said, \"Well, I plan to use healing techniques on you\u2026 is that okay?\"Xuelu nodded hard. \"If you can\u2026 then\u2026 thank you very much.\"The corners of her mouth were still dripping with blood, and even speaking became difficult, and she urgently needed medical treatment. However, she was suspicious of what Robb had just said. The man in front of her was wearing a weird commoner outfit. He claimed to have come to the mountains to gather herbs. But looking at it from any perspective, he looked nothing like a priest. \u201cDo you really know healing techniques?\u201dEveryone knows that healing arts can only be used by the priests loyal to the God of Light, Balder. How can this man in front of her be a priest?As soon as she thought of this, she saw Robb raise his hand, and a soft and golden light enveloped her. A warm feeling filled her body. It can't be wrong. This is definitely the healing magic of the holy element.The wound on her body began to heal at a speed visible to the naked eye, and the deformed arm quickly returned to its original shape. Even the three claw marks on her back disappeared without a trace and returned back to their previous perfect white and tender texture and appearance.The pain in her body instantly disappeared, and Xuelu sat up on the ground and looked at Robb next to her with a surprised look, \u201cYou\u2026 can really heal?\u201dRobb spread his hands. \"Just a little bit.\"Xuelu exclaimed, \u201cOh my God! You are a priest. I didn\u2019t notice at all. Ah, sorry, I was so rude. I should first give you my thanks for your help. If you weren\u2019t there, I would\u2019ve died.\u201dRobb said, \"Don't bother talking to me. Look at your two partners. It's embarrassing how they are doing without your support.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3: Go with us\u201cHey?\u201d Xuelu turned her head and looked. Sure enough, the two-legged dragon was attacking the warrior and archer restlessly. The warrior was knocked out again and hit a big tree with his back. Fortunately, warriors are usually thick-skinned and tough; thus, he is very resilient in fights. He shook his head and got up again, saying loudly, \"Jike, take the seriously injured Xuelu and leave\u2026 I\u2019ll hold this d*** two-legged dragon\u2026.\"The archer named Jike said, \"You might die!\"The warrior roared, \"I can escape, probably.\"At that moment, a familiar voice rang in the ears of the fighters and archers, \"Gorda, Jike, keep fighting! My injury has already healed.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d The warrior known as Gorda and the archer known as Jike turned their heads simultaneously and looked at Xuelu. The two saw Xuelu standing alive and kicking, with her left hand intact, as if the serious injury hadn't happened. It seems to be true. They couldn't help but be shocked.The slight shock almost killed them, and the two-legged dragon swooped down. Fortunately, Xuelu threw a fireball, which forced the dragon to fall back, saving them.Xuelu shouted, \"Don't be shocked. Keep fighting. This gentleman cured me. He is a priest.\"\u201cHey? Hey? There is a priest?\u201d The two men were overjoyed. Gorda raised his shield to block the next attack of the two-legged dragon and said loudly, \"That's amazing, Mr. Priest. Thank you for the healing Xuelu. Can you join us to deal with this two-legged flying dragon together? Afterward, we will divide the reward into four parts and give you one part too.\"Since they took the initiative to invite him to the team, Robb no longer had any concerns, and he could finally move with confidence. With a wave of his right hand, a soft light enveloped Gorda. The internal injury made by the two-legged dragon healed instantly, and he felt a massive rush of energy. This is indeed a genuine priest, such a powerful healing technique. It feels like he has a huge reservoir of magic power.With such a powerful priest behind him, he isn\u2019t afraid of the mere two-legged flying dragon anymore. Seeing that the dragon swooped down again, Gorda yelled, and the shield in his left hand moved forward and blocked! This time it easily stopped the dragon's impact, and with a counterattack, he stabbed the two-legged dragon\u2019s belly.\u201cHaha.\u201d Gorda roared, \u201cJike, Xuelu, shoot! I will focus on protecting the priest. We will slowly wear down this two-legged dragon.\"\u201cOkay!\u201d Jike\u2019s shoulder injury was also surrounded by a holy light and healed instantly. He was overjoyed and hurriedly drew his bow to release two arrows. The two powerful arrows accurately shot into the eyes of the two-legged dragon. It was so painful for the dragon that it raised its head and hissed.Xuelu once again chanted the magic, \u201cLoki, the God of Flames, please listen to my request and temporarily lend me the power of flames\u2026. Fly, Bird of Flames!\u201d A flaming bird flew from the tip of her wand and hit the dragon\u2019s chest.The three of them were able to fight vigorously, and they felt safe and happy with the priest.But Robb wasn\u2019t happy. Their attack power is terrible. They hit the dragon repeatedly for several rounds, but he was still alive. At this rate, they had to fight till the year of the monkey.The one you hit isn't tired, but I, the one watching you guys, is tired, really tired!Moreover, isn\u2019t this just the dragon blindly attacking and consuming his power while playing stupid? The dragon\u2019s eyes were worn out. Wouldn\u2019t he abandon his nest and run away? What are you guys going to do? The dragon doesn\u2019t even have any IQ!Robb shook his head and suddenly stretched out to block Gorda like an old hen protecting her cub, then he stepped forward and stood in front of him. \"Get out of the way. I'll take care of the dragon.\"\"Why?\" exclaimed Gorda. \u201cIt\u2019s dangerous, priest! Don\u2019t step forward. If you fall, we\u2019ll never be able to beat this two-legged dragon.The archer, Jiku, and the magician, Xuelu, were also startled, and both rushed forward at the same time, trying to get ahead of Robb, an instinctive reaction of any offensive profession.Protect Daddy!Robb shook his head and raised his hand high with his palm facing the sky.By this time, the two-legged dragon struck him violently, with a sharp gale on his paw, which, if this claw grasped firmly, the priest would definitely be torn in half on the spot.\u201cDanger!\u201dThe three people behind yelled in unison and rushed forward together.At this moment, Robb\u2019s hand slammed down. \u201c20 yards in radius, Holy Nova!\u201d (A yard is a unit of imperial length, and one yard is equal to 0.9144 meters. It is widely used in various Western Fantasy games. As a unit of measure for the scope of skills.)Sacred Nova is high-class magic of the Holy element, which likewise requires someone who holds a high-rank Holy class. It can restore the hp HP (Health Points) of all teammates in a large area and cause damage to enemies within the range.I saw a golden sphere in Robb's palm at the center, expanding in all directions, thus covering the range of 20 yards n an instant. Gorda, Jike, and Xuelu were bathed in the golden light at the same time. The holy light that they were bathed in gave them a very comfortable and reassuring feeling.However, the two-footed flying dragon did not feel as comfortable anymore. It felt power, holy magic hitting its head, and its power was even higher than that of the flame explosions, and flaming birds that were thrown by the female magician just now. This magic is way more terrifying, piercing the magic resistance of the two-legged dragon in an instant.It hissed and fell straight towards the ground, with a loud noise and splashing dust everywhere.Gorda, Jike, and Xuelu all looked astonished and forgot to speak for a moment.After a long time, until the dust dissipated, Xuelu shouted out, \u201cOh my God! The two-legged dragon is dead. It\u2019s dead\u2026 one blow! And the Holy Nova spell hasn\u2019t even ended, my goodness.\u201d\"My God, what kind of magic is this 'Holy Nova' spell?\" Gorda also exclaimed, \"As far as I know, the Sacred Nova is too large, and the holy element is scattered within its range, so its power is very weak. Usually, it's only used to deal with very weak and low-level monsters or to disperse the undead. Why can your Holy Nova defeat a two-legged dragon with a single blow?\"Robb, of course, can't say that he has fully maxed his proficiency in all holy professions. Even the highest-ranked holy profession, 'Pope,' has been maxed. In the beginning, to max the proficiency of 'Pope,' he spent a lot of money. It took a full two months to charge holy nova in a monster pile like a robot. How can it not be powerful?\"He could only spread his arms and say, \u201cMaybe I\u2019m just very religious.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4: My Name is RobbIn the game world, the power of one\u2019s magic mainly depends on the player\u2019s level, equipment, and proficiency.In the real world, however, the power of one's magic mainly comes from one's belief, practice, and meditation. The more devout a man is in the God of Light, the faster he can improve his holy magic and, consequently, the stronger the power of one's magic.Robb just killed the wyvern using Holy Nova, which is enough to show just how powerful his holy magic is, so of course, he must be one religious priest.The three adventurers couldn\u2019t help but be in awe, especially the red-haired female magician Xuelu. She couldn't help but sigh, \"Oh my God! Your level of devotion to the God of Light truly amazes me. I have never seen a more powerful priest than you, and your Holy Nova is more powerful than my flaming bird\u2026 I am beginning to wonder if I have the talent to be a magician.\"It's embarrassing indeed, and Robb thought to himself, \"In our game, did you know that a magician whose output is worse than a priest is going to be kicked out of the team? Well, forget it. You can't compare a low-ranking magician with Pope-level priests.\"He pointed to the corpse of the flying dragon. \u201cWhat are you going to do with this corpse?\u201dAfter defeating the wyvern, he instinctively ran over to \"touch the corpse\" and suddenly remembered that this was the real world, not a game. In the game, only when a monster is hit can its corpse be touched. In the real world, nothing can be felt from the monster.Only in the game can you do the strange routine of picking up silver coins from beasts. In the real world, beasts don\u2019t have the habit of running around with money.In addition, it\u2019s impossible for a monster\u2019s body to find anything like \u201cpork\u201d or \u201crabbit hair\u201d just by feeling around. If you want these things, you can only use a butcher\u2019s knife and slowly dissect them like Paoding Jie Niu (TL: For reference: https://fanti.dugushici.com/ancient_proses/71851). It\u2019s very annoying.However, it seems that the dragon\u2019s skin can be peeled off with the skinning skill\u2026 2 points of skinning proficiency, ah, no, I\u2019m already maxed.Thinking of this, he gave up dealing with the problem of the two-legged flying dragon corpse and let it be handed over to these natives.Points at the corpse of the two-legged dragon and reminds the three adventures to do their work. The three adventures were so shocked by the Holy Nova that they saw earlier that they forgot what they were doing. They couldn't help but shout, \"Ha, ha, ha, ha! At last, it fell! Let's take it back to the mayor for the bounty.\"Gorda said to the archer, \u201cJike, take the skin off the dragon, and you'll earn a lot of money when you get back and sell it.\" Then, he turned to Robb and said, \"Of course, Mr. Priest also has a share for both the bounty and the money for selling the dragon's skin.\"Robb thought to himself, \u201cHe\u2019s a very good man. No wonder he\u2019s the captain of the team.\u201dGorda asked, \u201cHow do we call you, Mr. Priest?\u201dRob thought, \"My current body is the one I used in the game, so I think I'll just tell them my in-game Name. In the future, I might not be able to use my original Name (Chinese Name) in this world. Using my IGN (TL: In-game Name) is probably better, so he said, \"My name is Vishmo Namorze Sidbuyabuyad.\"\u201cOh, what a long name.\u201d Gorda smiled. \u201cThen, we will call you Vishmo from now on.\u201dRobb shrugged. \"Uh, forget it, this Name was used in the game. It's okay. I don't know why it feels weird to be called by you. Just call me Robb.\"At this time, Jike was using a skinning knife and squatting beside the dragon, peeling its skin. As he peeled t, he turned his head and asked, \u201cMy. Priest\u2026 oh! Robb, did you come to ask us for directions?\u201d\u201cWell, yes.\u201d Robb said, \u201cI\u2019d like to ask for directions towards the nearest town.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you someone who lives near here? You don\u2019t seem familiar to the place at all.\u201d\"No.\" Robb had no choice but to lie. Casually, he lied, \"I'm from the far east. I've come a long way. I'm tired of wandering and adventuring, and now I'm just looking for a human town to settle in, so I don't have to walk around anymore.\"\"Oh, that's a shame,\" Golda said. \"We're short of a priest and want to invite you to join us. It's a shame that you're so strong that it doesn't seem like our small team is qualified to have you go with us, and you're tired of taking risks.\"Xuelu, the red-haired magician, said, \"Robb if you want to go to the nearest town, you can join us for a while. We'll go to West Wind Town that's at the foot of the mountain and report the two-legged dragon to the mayor in exchange for a good reward and sell the dragon skin. Your share is also in it, and it is probably better if you act with us.\"\"Okay then, let's go together.\" Robb had nothing to do with it, but he wanted to make a living, not to mention, it didn't really matter where he went. As for remuneration, he was a little interested. Whether in the game or in the real world, money is extremely useful, but he doesn't even have a penny right now.\"Jike peeled off the dragon's skin, rolled it up, and placed it on Gorda\u2019s shoulder. The skin of the wyvern was very thick and heavy. It was a big roll, like a thick quilt. Gorda carried it without much effort and smiled. \"Robb, Jike, Xuelu! Let\u2019s go! Let\u2019s go down the mountain.\u201dRobb followed the three of them, walking slowly.As if interested, Xielu came to Robb, and after walking two steps toward him, she said, \"Robb, thank you for helping us today. Without you, we'd be in big trouble today. Especially for me, there's a good chance I'd die there earlier, especially for me. You saved my life, so to speak.Robb stretched out his hand and urged, \"Why doesn't your adventure party have a priest, your team only has a T (TL: Tank) and a D (TL: Damage Dealer) to deal with the two-legged dragon.\" (TL: Revised and edited this sentence to make it easier to understand. Honors to Kastellan for helping me understand this sentence.)At the end of his sentence, Xieru was dazed, and her face seemed like she was confused, \"I can understand every word you said, but I have no idea what you mean.\"Robb changed his language and sighed, \"You came out to kill monsters, but you didn't bring a priest?\"Xuelu smiled awkwardly. Gorda turned around in front and said awkwardly, \"We miscalculated the strength of the two-legged dragon\u2026 cough\u2026. We thought it was a normal two-legged dragon. We thought it was enough to deal with it. I didn't expect it to be considered an elite among the two-legged flying dragons. It ended up becoming such a hard fight, and almost all of us died. It truly makes you laugh.\u201cOh!\u201d Robb muttered in his heart, \u201cThis dragon was an elite? It seems that the strength of the monsters of this world is weaker than the monsters of \"Dark Blade\" I played. The elite monsters in there couldn't be settled with Holy Nova. At least I had to change to a serious offensive class and use real offensive magic to defeat it in a single blow.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5: Are you a hero?Along the way, Xielu, like all magicians, was curious about everything in the world. And thus, she was naturally very interested in Robb, who seemed to be a \"mysterious\" priest. She asked Robb a barrage of questions, such as where he was from, how long he's been studying holy magic, where he had been prior to their encounter, and what manners and customs he has experienced, relentlessly, like someone's who's mouth just couldn't stop talking.Robb, however, couldn't answer her questions. He was still oblivious to the details of this world and knew nothing. He said nothing, remaining silent and occasionally replying to Xielu\u2019s questions.This kind of silent and indifferent attitude would've angered the girl long before anyone else. But he has shown himself to be extremely powerful. A powerful man who says only a few words yet is meaningful is often called \"earnest\" or \"mature.\" Girls don't hate this type of man; instead, they look up to and admire them.So, as she kept talking, Robb learned more about the world from her words.This world was ultimately called the \"Fengmo Continent,\" and there were three great kingdoms on the continent: Norma, the kingdom of knights, in the northwest, Gran, the kingdom of magic, in the southwest, and Big Tang, the kingdom of rabbit men, in the east. On the border between these great kingdoms, there are numerous small countries as big as sesame and mung beans, but it isn\u2019t worth mentioning;And the mountain they are currently on is called the Black Pine Mountain Range. It belongs to the territory of the magic kingdom \"Gran.\" To the east of the mountain range is a vast plain, wherein the \"Capital of Saints\" sits, and to the west is a barbaric land where monsters run rampant, with only a few towns near the border.The Westwind town they were going to was just west of the mountain range, a place surrounded by monsters.As the four descended the hillside, they could often see goblin heads poking their heads out, as well as a lone ogre looking at them from a distance, and upon seeing the four of them, none of the creatures dared to come near the party.\"It wasn\u2019t until the sun had set and the sky began to darken that Westwind Town was finally visible.This is a small town built on the hillside of the Black Pine Mountain Range. It was full of stone buildings, all well-built but not aesthetically beautiful. As the sky was turning dark, lights started being lit up everywhere around the town. The militia was standing on the town wall, with torches lit at intervals on the wall, shining clearly within a few meters of the town wall.Robb saw a few mines open next to the town, and a few carts were ready at its entrance. It seemed that this was a town for mining, but he didn't know what type of ore it produced.He felt that his mining and forging skills were starting to move around again, so he had to warn himself. \"You have already lost your interest in mining and forging since you've maxed them out.\"The four of them walked towards the town, and when the guards guarding the entrance of the town saw Gorda and the dragon skin situated on his shoulder, they immediately cheered, \u201cAh, Mr. Gorda is back with the skin of the two-legged dragon! Oh my god! They succeeded in defeating it.\u201dSeveral guards came. Someone came and shouted, \u201cMr. Gorda\u2019s back. They've killed that damned two-legged dragon. Let's cheer.\"The doors of many households of the town opened, and men and women, old and young, all gathered around the gate. Soon, hundreds of people gathered.Gorda spread the skin of the two-legged dragon flat on the ground, and with one foot, he stepped on it.As soon as the crowd gathered around, they began to chatter, \u201cThat mark on its back, it\u2019s the double-legged flying dragon. I\u2019m certain of it. I can\u2019t be wrong.\u201d\u201cGreat, this guy ate a cow from my house!\u201d\u201cMy son was killed by it, and it has finally paid for it with its life, oooo\u2026. It has finally paid for it with its life.\u201d\u201cMy. Gorda is so good. We didn't raise money in vain.\"Amidst the talk of the townspeople, a middle-aged man, well dressed and square-faced, approached, and the townspeople saluted him. It appeared that he was the mayor. He told the townspeople to line at the side, walked in front of Gorda, squatted, carefully looked at the skin of the two-legged dragon, and, after a while, raised his head to make sure it was the skin of the two-legged dragon he had commissioned to remove. He then raised his head and said, \u201cOh, brave adventurers, thank you so much. This dragon has caused great trouble to befall our village. Now that it\u2019s been slain, we should be able to live a long and peaceful life. We\u2019ve had two adventurers deal with it before, but they failed. Mr. Gorda is the best.\u201dGorda smiled a couple of times and said awkwardly, \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault. I didn\u2019t really know that the double-legged dragon was an elite. I almost failed too. Fortunately, there was this man, Mr. Robb. He\u2019s the one who lent his help to slay the dragon. He was so powerful that he defeated it with only one spell.\u201dAt this moment, everyone\u2019s attention shifted to Robb.\u201cWow, that\u2019s awesome!\u201d\u201cWith one spell, the double-legged dragon was brought down?\u201d\u201cOh, my God! I\u2019ve seen that dragon take down so many strong soldiers with my own eyes.\u201d\u201cThis Mr. Robb is amazing\u2026.\u201d\u201cIs he better than Mr. Gorda?\u201dHearing the audience\u2019s exclamation, Gorda added, \"His name is Robb, a priest. I saw with my own eyes that he healed me and my companion's wounds and slew the dragon simultaneously. I dare say he is the most devoted priest I have ever seen.\"What? Did he kill the double-legged flying dragon using the Holy Nova in one blow? The mayor was sent into a daze. Although most of the townspeople don't know the difference between weak magic and true offensive magic, the mayor is well-informed. He knows that although Holy Nova can heal his companions and harm enemies within its range, its power is terribleStrictly speaking, most holy magic is used for healing, and barely any of them are lethal. How devout to the God of Light do you have to be to be able to take down a double-legged flying dragon with magic like the Holy Nova? He's a super fanatic. How much power did the God of Light lend him?The mayor hurriedly gave Robb a solemn salute. \u201cHonorable messenger of light, Mr. Robb, allow me to welcome you on behalf of the Westwind Town. Your arrival has made all the residents of Westwind Town feel supreme honor.\u201dRobb stretched out his hand. \u201cWell said, well said! I just want to ask one question... when's dinner? I'm hungry.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 6": "Chapter 6: The mayor gave you a real estate\u201cEating?\u201d The mayor was dumbfounded for two seconds and immediately changed his expression into a smile and said, \"Oh, look at me. You must've been exhausted from your hard trek up the mountain, fighting the double-legged dragon. Of course, you'll have a nice meal. I'm just talking about useless stuff. I was stupid. Follow me, please.\"He turned around to lead the way, followed by Robb, Gorda, Jike, and Xielu, with the townspeople on either side and swarmed the mayor's house. They set up torches and tables in the middle of the courtyard without entering the house.Everyone was pleased with the success of the mission. These sidehammer towns had a simple custom. They dance when they\u2019re happy. Many men and women sang and danced at the table. Several pairs of young people were holding hands by Robb\u2019s table, twirling and dancing around it\u2026Robb was really hungry. He picked up a roasted lamb leg, took a bite, and instantly felt his brain trembling. What am I eating? What\u2019s this weird taste? What kind of fu****** roasted lamb legs are these? Even the worst roast lamb restaurant he'd been to couldn't make such terrible food.Well, forget it. I\u2019m too hungry. So I should eat my fill first.As he ate, he thought, \"It's still the food the mayor gave me to eat. If I had to eat the food given by the townspeople, it would probably taste even worse. If I have to live here, I'll probably have to make food for myself. Fortunately, I've maxed all professions, so my chef skills are maxed. Cooking isn't a pain. If I prepare the ingredients first, I can synthesize food with only one skill.The mayor took out a bag and laid it on the table.Gorda quickly opened the bag, and it was full of silver coins. Robb didn't count, but just from seeing it, he could guess that three or four hundred silver coins were contained within, which seemed to be a considerable amount of money. After a moment, a merchant passed by and placed a large pile of silver coins on the table. He smiled and said, \u201cMr. Gorda, that dragon skin if you don't need it, sell it to me.\"Gorda laughed and punched the merchant. \"You are a cunning man. You can buy normal dragon skin for only two hundred silver coins. You couldn't buy such elite double-legged flying dragon skin if you were in the capital, even with five hundred silver coins.\"The businessman chuckled and said, \"All I earn is hard money. It takes a lot of risks to be able to bring it to the capital of saints. Countless monsters roam there. It would take too much effort if you carry it all the way to the city of saints.Okay, here you are.\u201d Gorda laughed and received the merchant\u2019s money. He mixed it with the mayor\u2019s remuneration, and, instead of counting every penny, he poked it with his hands and divided it into four piles, one larger than the other three.He said with a smile, \u201cCome, come, come, one person at a time, take it! Mr. Robb, this pile is yours.\u201dHe pushed the largest pile of silver coins into Rob\u2019s face.Robb had to change his impression of Gorda again. He is too generous and sensible. This two-footed flying dragon was basically killed by Robb alone, and so it was only natural for him to take the largest share. However, Robb doesn't mind this small amount of money. If he really wanted to make money, he could use his ability to kill black dragons, golden dragons, a dragon of destruction, etc., every minute. The money that can be earned probably doesn't have to be mentioned. After all, just selling the double-legged flying dragon earned him a fortune.It doesn\u2019t really matter if he gets more or less of the money, but he likes Gorda\u2019s attitude toward dividing the money. This is something only a mature leader or a sensible person would consider.Rob, who also needed money to survive in the world, casually threw silver coins into his jeans' pockets, which bulged out at his sides and behind his buttocks, but the T-shirt and jeans he wore were so weird that nobody cared about it.The mayor said, \u201cThank you again, the four people who gave the Westwind Town help!\u201dGorda laughed loudly, \u201cWell, you\u2019ll probably have to get rid of some other monster next time.\u201d At this point, he suddenly remembered something and smiled at the mayor.\u201d But I may not be useful to your town in the future.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d asked the mayor curiously.Gorda pointed to Robb. \"Mr. Robb said that he's come a long way. He's tired and doesn't want to explore anymore. That's why he followed us to Westwind Town. He'll probably stay here, I suppose. After that, if the town wants to eliminate some monster, it won't us doing the work, haha!\u201dUpon hearing this, the mayor turned his head to Robb and asked, \"Respected Mr. Robb, would you like a place to live?\"\u201cYeah!\u201d said Robb. \u201cI\u2019m tired of grinding. Grinding doesn\u2019t mean anything to me now. I just want to silently AFK\u2026\u201dAt that moment, he noticed that all the people at the table were bewildered and coughed. \"I've come too far. I'm tired. I just want to find a place with green mountains and clean water, far away from the hustle and bustle of the world, and live a quiet life for a few years.\"Everyone at the other table understood his words clearly!The mayor\u2019s mind moved. This Mr. Robb looked so strong that as long as he stays in the town, whenever monsters attack the town, he'll be forced to protect the town to protect his home. Thus, the townspeople would be a lot safer and will be less likely to call adventurers.He couldn\u2019t help but exclaim with great joy, \u201cThat\u2019s great. Just stay in Westwind Town. It only has a green mountain and clean water!\u201dRobb replied, \u201cGreen mountains and clean water? There are several mines at the entrance of the town. It\u2019s a mess.\u201dMayor. \u201cUh\u2026\u201dThis was embarrassing. He hurried on, \u201cWe\u2019re far from the hustle and bustle. It\u2019s quiet here. It\u2019s a good place to settle down.\u201dRobb continued, \u201cWhy do you even raise money to hire adventurers? Obviously, it\u2019s because monsters often come to make trouble. It hurts to be so skilled.\u201dMayor. \u201cUh\u2026\u201d (TL: \u0449(\u0298\u257b\u0298)\u0449)Robb suddenly discovered that he had inadvertently learned a hidden profession, \u201ctsukkomi\u201d (TL: Japanese term). It felt so good spitting at someone to the point where their stomachs turn inside out.The mayor was so enjoined that he had no choice but to use his trump card. \"Mr. Robb, there's a chapel in town, but the priest when to the capital of saints and never returned. It's empty now. It just so happens that you are also the messenger of the God of Light. It would probably be best for you to manage it. What do you think?\u201d\u201cYo! The mayor didn\u2019t want to irk me, so he threw real estate at me,\u201d Robb thought. Well, I\u2019ve got to jump into this offer. If I want to live a comfortable life, I must eat, dress, and live. These three conditions are a must to have a comfortable life. Now I\u2019ve solved my accommodations right away. Comrade Mayor, you've got a lot of nerve.He spread his hands and told the mayor, \u201cWell, then I\u2019ll stay here for a while.\u201d\u3010Robb acquired a chapel\u3011Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7: Are you guys leaving?It was already very late by the time we finished eating dinner, so it wasn't too convenient to go to my real estate today.Robb and Gorda\u2019s party slept at the mayor's residence, but Gorda\u2019s snoring was so loud that they couldn\u2019t sleep in the same room as him, so Robb got up and sat down on a stone bench in the mayor's backyard.A figure slowly approached nearer. The red-headed magician, Xielu smiling, sat on the other stone bench beside Robb, looking at him with her head tilted.\u201cWhy? Is there anything on my face?\u201d asked Robb.\u201cYou exude a mysterious feeling.\u201d Xielu smiled, \u201cGorda and Jike may not have said it as I did, but they probably felt the same way. You were once a big shot, weren\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Robb exclaimed, \u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d\u201cOf course, first of all is because of your power. Needless to say, your magical powers are so powerful that you don\u2019t even need to chant or say a spell. And you can even cast magic with just a move of your hand. My God, I suspect that you might have an artifact on you that can shorten the time it needs for you to cast your spells. If a priest as good as you doesn\u2019t have a high position in the church of light, then you must\u2019ve had a high position in the past. It is impossible for you to be a no-name small priest, not to mention your attitude\u2026\u201d At this point, she pauses and organizes her words.A few seconds later, she continued, \u201cYou have a calm air surrounding you, and when you walk it us, you unintentionally release the aura of a great, powerful man, walking about the streets with his men. It\u2019s very subtle.\"Hey? Did I?\" Robb thought carefully, and perhaps he did. If someone uses a maxed account to go with some low-level players, he'll inevitably feel like an \"old man with a new man\", unintentionally. This is not good. I'll try to keep a low profile, so I don't gather too much attention. No, no one in this world will use a small trumpet on people anymore.Xuelu asked, \u201cAre you a high priest? Grand Priest? An Oracle? A cardinal? Oh, but you can\u2019t but such a young cardinal, but I think you\u2019ve probably held one of the other posts, and you must\u2019ve been or were a great figure in the church of light.\u201dRobb thought, \u201cThere\u2019s still the Pope, you mentioned all the top professions of the church, but you\u2019re right. I\u2019ve done them all.\u201dThough he only thought that in his mind and didn\u2019t reply to her, the expression on his face betrayed his intentions.The expression on Xieru\u2019s face hardened. She lowered her voice and exclaimed, \u201cOh my God, are you really such a big figure? I can feel that you aren\u2019t a normal person, but I didn\u2019t know that you were this good.\u201dRobb said, \"Well, you know my secret now. I might have to kill to silence someone.\"Xielu was visibly startled, and for a moment, she turned pale and trembled.Robb didn't realize that he frightened her, \"Heyyy, I\u2019m just joking.\u201d\u201cHuh!\u201d Xielu heaved a sigh of relief. \"Please don't make these kinds of jokes. You are too strong to be doing so. I almost jumped back and threw a ball of fire at you.\"Still a little frightened, she looked timidly at Robb's face and saw his soft expression. This time, she was truly relieved. She whispered to him, \"Why did a big figure like you come to such a small town? Are you on a secret mission? Or\u2026 huh? Could it be that you are being ostracized or even being chased? I've heard of such a story in the past where some great man offended another great man and was hunted down by a big army, so he had to live in a small town under a new name.\"\u201cYour imagination is too wild.\u201d Robb said, \u201cI just want to be carefree and lazy.\u201dHis laziness shocked Xielu again. \u201cSloth is one of the seven sins!\u201d she whispered. A normal man must go to a priest to confess. But for a great man like you to speak about laziness is a bad example! It would be bad if followers of the church of light follow your example\u2026 I think I at least know why you were ostracized.\"Robb thought, \"You're such a funny girl. Forget it. I'm too lazy to explain. I'll just go with being ostracized because of the seven sins.\"He didn\u2019t want to think about the question anymore. He asked, \u201cAre you leaving tomorrow?\u201dXielu nodded, \u201cYes, Gorda took a commission. In the birch forest to the southwest, a small village was invaded by trolls, and the villagers requested us to get rid of them. We've been here for days looking for the double-legged dragon, so we're tight in time. We have to get up early tomorrow and leave.\"\"Oh!\" replied Robb, apparently cold and seemingly indifferent about their future journey, but in fact, he was secretly worried. He was a more affectionate man than he had imagined. The three adventurers weren't annoying, making him feel a sense of attachment to them. He didn't want to hear from some traveling merchant that they'd been eaten by a troll in the birch forest a few days later.However, he also didn't have any intentions of accompanying them to the birch forest.Their journey doesn't end after reaching the birch forest. They might go to the black birch forest or the yellow birch forest afterward. They still have countless adventurers set for them, it's impossible for Robb to babysit them forever. Perhaps, he can give them a little gift to pin their blessings on their lapels and say his farewells.\u201cBy the way, since you\u2019re a magician, you often make magic scrolls. Do you have a blank scroll for making magic scrolls?\u201d asked Robb.\u201cOf course I do. Xielu takes a pocket from her waist and rolls a parchment from it. If this is the game world, this is a material named \"blank magic scroll\". Magicians can engrave magic he has already mastered on the scroll and give it to someone else. Even if the recipient isn't a magician, he can still use the scroll to evoke the engraved magic.Robb picks up the piece of parchment and uses the \"Create Magical Scroll\" skill. He selects \"Transmit,\" and selects the material \"Blank magic scroll,\" and begins to engrave the magic\u2026A cold blue light spread around him in an instant and dispersed into the parchment. A strange symbol began to appear on the parchment, which too was giving a faint blue light.Xieru glanced at it and exclaimed, \u201cThe magic scroll of instantaneous teleportation\u2026 It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s a precious life-saving magic.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8: Such a precious scrollInstant transmission is magic used to teleport yourself to another place in an instant.When you are in danger and your life is at stake, you can use the \"Instant transmission scroll\", and you'll instantly be put out of danger. It can be said to be one of the necessary scrolls for traveling and killing people. Unfortunately, normal magicians can only do \"Transmission.\" Only a few people know \"Instant transmission,\" and \"Instant transmission\" without the word \"Instant\" is a long way off.\u201cTransmission\u201d usually requires a pre-drawn magic formation on the ground, where the magician stands to make a long chant that lasts minutes to tens of minutes. This slow chanting speed can\u2019t save your life when your life and death are at stake.But \u201cInstant transmission\u201d is different. It is instant.The only disadvantage is that only a few people in Fengmo continent know how to use this magic. Only the highest-ranked magicians can use it. Moreover, just knowing the magic isn't enough for you to make an instant transmission scroll because it requires more magic power to create a scroll than to use it. The magician has to pour much of his magic power to make the scroll. After finishing, he has to meditate for a long time to replenish his lost magic power.Usually, they won't just give away the scrolls because of their high rank. And because they usually aren't lacking in money, they wouldn't sell or give away such powerful scrolls for money. Else, they might fall into their enemy's hands and save their lives instead.For instance, one day, a great magician fought with his old enemy and finally got the upper hand. However, the enemy suddenly took out the instant transmission he sent six months ago, smiled at him, and said, \"Thank you.\"Them, the scroll activates, and he doesn't have an idea as to where he went. And he'll spit out blood from your stomach out of anger.Because of that, such scrolls are incredibly rare! No, commoners didn\u2019t even have a chance to see it. Xielu recognized the spell because she saw it in a book.Xielu couldn\u2019t help but be stunned, \u201cWhat? My God, you\u2026 you can do this? Aren\u2019t you a priest?\u201d\"Shh!\" Robb put a finger up to his lips and whispered, \"Be quiet, don't tell others. I want to remain low-key, low-key.\"Xuelu hurriedly covered her lips and looked around carefully, \u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t mean to shout, but I was shocked.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d laughed Robb. \u201cI used Detection magic earlier. No one else is in the vicinity right now. But if you keep shouting, someone might hear you.\"\u201cDetection\u2026 detection magic?\u201d Xielu was startled. \u201cThat\u2019s a ranger\u2019s exclusive skill. You\u2026 what in the world are you\u2026?\u201dRobb laughed and said, \"Well, don't ask. I'll really be forced to kill someone if you keep digging into it.\"Xielu wasn't afraid this time. She looked at Robb softly. It was obviously a joke, and there seemed to be a hidden meaning in Robb's words: One of trust, Robb believed that she wouldn't spread gossip. The other was self-confidence. Robb wasn't afraid of her spreading it. Even if he had been known to the world just how mysterious and powerful he was, he wasn't afraid of the repercussions of what might happen to him.Xielu nodded, \u201cWell, then I won\u2019t ask! Now I know that you\u2019re a lot stronger than we initially thought. You seem to not only have practiced holy magic but spatial magic and ranger skills as well. Not to mention, you\u2019re still so young.\u201dShe already understands that Robb studies several kinds of magic, however it isn't rare to study multiple kinds of magic. Many powerful magicians study several kinds of magic. The most common ones are fire, water, wind, and lightning. It's just that\u2026 Robb seems to be the most powerful of the multiple magic practitioners she's ever seen. Not only is his holy magic so strong that it can take down a double-legged dragon in one blow, but even his space magic has reached the level of a great mage. It's scary. It's truly very scary.Robb picked up the instant transmission scroll and put it in Xielu\u2019s hands, \u201cHere, this is for you. When you are in an adventure and you run into danger, just activate the instant transmission scroll. Remember, this scroll can only carry a team of five people with you. When you use it, make sure that all the people you want to use it on are within 5 yards of you.\u201dXielu said, \"Hey,\" and stammered, \"For me? Such\u2026 such a rare and precious thing\u2026 for me?\"Robb spread ut his hands, \u201cIt\u2019s for you. Am I the type of person who doesn\u2019t commit to his words?\u201d\u201cBut\u2026 but.. it\u2019s too valuable.\u201dRobb winked and smiled, \u201cOh? Then you don\u2019t want it? You can just give it back.\u2019Xuelu\u2019s expression went stiff. The gift was too expensive. It was just a casual encounter, so it's a little too much to accept. But what she was holding in her hand was an additional life, and it was a pity for her to return it to Robb. Her little hand trembled softly, holding the scroll in its grasp.\u201cWell, don\u2019t worry about it. Just keep it.\u201d Robb laughed. \u201cYou saw how easy it was for me to make it, so you should know just how unimportant it is to me.\u201d\u201cIs it that easy to make this?\u201d I\u2019ve heard that it takes a lot of magic power to make this, and it usually takes dozens of days of meditation to replenish the loss of magic power with the power of a great mage. Are you\u2026 tired now, just to let me take it, understating your losses?\u201d Xielu asked cautiously.\"Oh?\" answered Robb calmly, sensing his condition and discovering that it only consumed a fraction of his magic power. After all, in the game and not in the real world, how can a game with a very high magic consumption be fun? If the players don't enjoy the gaming experience, the game won't be able to profit.To put it in another way, players in the game don't really die. Even if they make a mistake while fighting monsters, it is only a matter of resurrecting in the nearest city. Most players wouldn't use instant transmission scrolls to save their lives. They just use it to get to the road or jump over some rough terrain.So, the value of the scroll in the game is so low that it's impossible for the developer to make it have a high magic power consumption.Robb got an important piece of information from Xielu. His skill system is subtly different from those of this world, at least in terms of magic consumption. And if there\u2019s another genius who has mastered all of the professions, he won\u2019t be able to beat Robb.Without magic power, no matter how many skills or magic you have or know, you won\u2019t be able to cut it flat! It\u2019ll only make creep me out, for fear of you being a ghost.These thoughts passed in an instant. Robb smiled and said to Xielu, \"There's only a little loss, but I don't need to go out and take risks anymore. I guard the chapel leisurely daily, and the lost magic power will soon be replenished. So take this scroll with confidence. I'd rather not hear you fall into an accident than my loss of magic power.\"Then, she glanced at Robb with a flirtatious look, \u201cIf you could, I really wish that you could join me on an adventure.\u201dRobb stretched out his hand, \u201cI\u2019m really sorry. I\u2019m tired of doing tasks\u2026 Well, I\u2019m tired of helping people with their missions. I just want to be lazy and have a leisurely life.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9: This is not the lazy life I wantEarly the next morning, the three adventurers were escorted by Robb and the mayor and left the Westwind Town to set off for the birch forest to the southwest.Xielu was somewhat reluctant, but for a young adventurer like her, the temptation of adventure was far greater than a leisurely life. She couldn't stay in one place, and her little admiration for Robb and her budding feelings were forcibly shut. She had to suppress her strange feelings forcefully and waved goodbye to Robb.\u201cKeep safe!\u201d Robb gave an Eastern way of saying his farewells.\u201cYes!\u201d Xielu patted the bag hanging from her waist, which contained the instant transmission scroll that Robb had given her. She certainly wouldn't say it publicly, so a couple of pats conveyed her meaning.Gorda laughed loudly, \u201cIf we had a priest, we would be safer.\u201dRobb spread out his hands, \u201cYou guys will, but not me.\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s a shame.\u201d Gorda laughed and turned away. Jike and Xielu followed him, and the three slowly disappeared into the mountain path southwest of the town.At last, the mayor was relieved to see that Robb didn't leave with the party of adventurers. Now, Westwind town won't be bullied anymore by the likes of monsters. He faced Robb, \"Mr. Robb, it's time to show you the chapel.\"\u201cOh, thank you.\u201dWith the mayor in front leading the way, Robb followed. The two walk through the town. When I arrived last night, it was already evening, so I didn't get to take a close look at the town, and today, I can see it clearly. It's a small town with less than a thousand inhabitants. Merchants shipped from larger cities sell daily necessities like salt, cloth, utensils, etc... Minerals, crops, animal fur, and herbs produced in small towns must be shipped to large cities to bring income to everyone.For this small town, the trading routes are necessary for living, and once the routes are cut, the inhabitants will be short of goods, and life will be very inconvenient. It is no wonder the townspeople were prompted to raise money to get rid of the double-legged flying dragon, which often attacked caravans. Otherwise, nobody would have been able to survive.The mayor took Robb to the back of the town near a hill where a small chapel had been built. It was a little shabby because it's been years since the last priest stayed, but it should be as good as new with a little care.In the chapel yard, there were stone tables and chairs, wells, and a small field, and on the hill behind, a cemetery, though not too large, spread along the hill with hundreds of gravestones.Robb didn't like living next to the cemetery, but the churches in the west also had cemeteries. It was normal, so he couldn't complain.The mayor laughed, saying, \"This church will be left to Mr. Robb's care! I'll inform the whole town that we finally have a priest in Westwind town. We finally have a place to confess to in the future.\"Robb thought, \"Shit, confession? Will I have to sit in there and listen to the babble outside? It's annoying! But if he thought about it, he doesn't seem to be annoyed. It's something he hasn't done yet in the game, so he isn't tired of it yet. Hahaha, he's not tired of it yet!\"Robb wouldn\u2019t be lazy as long as he wasn\u2019t tired of playing.Besides, sitting in a cabin and talking to people is really interesting.He isn't like a clam. He isn't autistic! Actually, he's someone who likes making friends. Otherwise, he wouldn't have set up a guild before fighting wars. If he didn't like to socialize, then he wouldn't have played an MMO. Playing a single-player game would've been way more pleasant.In this world, where the internet doesn't exist, there is no QQ group, and no one to watch anime with, socializing can be a huge problem. If the townspeople came to talk to him, it would probably be okay.The mayor sent a few servants to help Robb clean the place up, laid out his bedroom, brought in some basic necessities, and took the servants away. Now, only Robb was left in the church.Quiet, happy, and finally, lazy.Robb found a stone stool in the small courtyard in front of the chapel and sat down. Looking up at the sky and watching flowers bloom and fall in front of the courtyard, watching the clouds move in the sky and relax, lying drunk on the hills, and smiling at the clouds being born and extinguished.It feels so good to be lazy. It's been a long time since he's experienced this!After an hour of being idle, Robb became thirsty.The real world isn\u2019t a game, so it\u2019s possible to become thirsty, and this was a serious problem. Although Robb can use magic to create water, it tastes soulless. Take WOW, for example, mages can create water and bread by themselves, but they still like buying proper food not made by magic.He had to get up and use the wooden cup the mayor gave. He was looking for a place to fetch water and suddenly remembered that there is no running water in this world.Now he's in trouble. He'll have to dig up a well and drink from it if he wants water. Isn\u2019t it troublesome?It\u2019s over! It\u2019s over! It\u2019s all over!This isn\u2019t the lazy life I want.Robb began to consider issues regarding laziness seriously.If I want to be comfortable in the real world, I\u2019ll need to solve the following problems: drinking water, eating food, washing clothes, and hygiene.Although he has just solved the drinking water problem (TL: inconveniently using the well), there are still a lot of problems waiting to be solved, and it doesn't seem possible just to solve it with a faucet. Take eating, for example. Although he has maxed his cooking skill, he needs the corresponding ingredients. For example, in the famous dish \"Delicious Wind Snake,\" you need to use \"Mutated fish\" and \u201cSweet Spices\u201d to make it (I don\u2019t know why snakes aren\u2019t listed in the ingredients). Skills alone aren\u2019t enough.And if you want to get the ingredients, I\u2019ll inevitably have to go to the vegetable market and bargain with the vegetable market aunt. How annoying.As for washing and cleaning, that's not something you can do in the game.Robb began to feel the difficulties in life. It\u2019s like the size of a mountain. He couldn\u2019t afford to be lazy.It seems that the only way was to be a damned feudal landlord and enslave others, just like how the mayor ordered his servants to clean up the church.Robb\u2019s eyes lit up as soon as he thought of slaves, hoping to get a maid with blue hair put on a black, white-rimmed maid uniform to take charge of his daily life.Wow, I can\u2019t. I shouldn\u2019t think about this. In the end, he just couldn\u2019t stop thinking about it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10: Maid recruitment, blue-haired girls firstHalf an hour later, Robb arrived at one of the crossroads of Westwind Town, where a small number of merchants and peddlers gathered. However, because of its small size and population of not more than one thousand inhabitants, Westwind town isn't prosperous. Except for one cloth selling shop that looked a little luxurious, the other shops looked small, dirty, and deserted.Robb took out a few silver coins, bought a white cloth, and took a pen. Then, he wrote on it, \"Maid Recruitment: includes food, accommodations, five insurances (TL: endowment insurance, medical insurance, unemployment insurance, work-related injury insurance, maternity insurance, and housing provident funds).\" Feeling that he wrote something wrong, he erased everything with magic. He wrote the words, \u201cHiring a maid, ages between 15-20, with good facial features, hardworking. If interested, apply for an interview with priest Robb of the town. Additional Notes: Blue-haired girls are prioritized.\u201dAfter writing it down, Robb clapped his hands and put the cloth on a wall in the middle of the streets.This world really is convenient. You can post ads on the streets. If you do something like this in my previous world, you'll definitely be beaten to death by the city officials.Anyway, I\u2019m already in the middle of town, so I\u2019ll try to prepare the things I need for dinner well. At least before successfully recruiting a maid, Robb had to do everything by himself to stay well-fed. He knows that it was impossible to buy ingredients used to create high-ranking cooking recipes and that only some basic dishes and ingredients can be bought here.As expected, there wasn\u2019t much to buy on the streets. Luckily, he managed to buy a large piece of wild boar and some salt to make \u201cRoasted Wild Boar\u201d. Tonight\u2019s dinner was happily decided.Just when he was about to return to the chapel with the wild boar on his shoulder, a stout merchant approached him. He was the same merchant who bought the double-legged dragon from Gorda yesterday. He smiled at Robb, \u201cMr. Robb, I just saw your post. It seems like you\u2019re looking for a maid.\u201d\"Yes,\" said Robb, reluctant to accept human trafficking. However, in this day and age, there was no such \"hiring\" of maids. An enslaved person can only be bought, just as they say, do as the Romans do, and for his own laziness, he could only be a cold-hearted human trafficker.\"Mr. Robb,\" said the stout merchant, laughing, \"I have a new maid in my hand. I bought her the other day from a small village in Stone Canyon. Her parents died, and she lived with her aunt. Her aunt couldn't feed her anymore, so she sold her to me. I was going to sell her to the nobles in the capital. But now that Mr. Robb is interested, I think I should hand her over to you here so that I may save some trouble for both you and me.\"\u201cOh?\u201d Robb tilted his head, \u201cDoes she have blue hair?\u201d\"Well, why does Mr. Robb prefer blue hair?\" He continued, \"As far as I know, there aren't any humans with blue hair. Only girls of elves, harpies, ghosts, and other races have blue hair.\"\"No blue-haired girls?\" Robb felt disappointed, but upon further reflection, he realized that the blue-haired maid he liked in a cartoon in his previous race was of the ghost race and wasn't a human.\"\"But lord Robb doesn't need to be troubled by such a thing.\" The merchant laughed, saying, \"You just have to dye her hair blue. It's simple.\"\u201cFine, seems reasonable enough.\u201d Robb said, \u201cTake me to see the girl you talked about.\u201dThe stout merchant tore off the notice on the wall and brought Robb to his residence. He had a had in the town in Westwind town, which wasn't small. It had many servants, all armed. They seemed to be the capital of his journey from the North to the South.The merchant gestured Robb to sit in the drawing-room, and soon two servants came in with a thin blonde girl, barefoot, dressed in ragged linen, with holes in her clothes covering her arms and calves, and her skin could be seen. But fortunately, her important parts were tightly wrapped and covered.Her clothes and hair were dirty, but her face was washed clean. It seems that it was in preparation for the buyers since buyers would find her ugly if her face was dirty.The merchant smiled, \"This girl has just turned 16. I assure you she's a pure virgin. My wife has personally examined her. Look at her. She looks like this. You can't find a better-looking maid in Westwind town.\u201dRobb took a serious look at the girl. She was indeed pure and beautiful. But if there\u2019s something wrong, she\u2019s a bit too thin, to the point where it\u2019s distressing. She couldn\u2019t even stand. Such a poor girl, she must\u2019ve suffered a lot.She's so pitiful. She should never have fallen into other people's hands. At least I\u2019ll treat her with human rights. Especially considering the native nobles of this world, it\u2019s hard to say.Robb said, \u201cWell, she seems fine. How much does it cost to buy her?\u201dThe merchant said, \"If a beautiful pure virgin like her were to be taken to the capital of saints and sold to their nobles, she would sell for at least ten gold coins, but I don't dare to take so much money from you with my conscience. It would also save me a lot of money to sell here. Let's do it this way then, just five gold coins, and I'll only earn the fare to get her here from Stone Canyon.\"Although he didn\u2019t know this world\u2019s pricing system, he believed that a small merchant would not dare deceive him. He believes that the people of this world seem to fear the \u201cOracle of Light\u201d and that the little merchant wouldn\u2019t dare to bully the \u201cOracle of Light.\u201dBesides, to Robb, five golds to buy a beautiful woman seemed like a mad bargain. Robb would buy and take all the girls home if all the pretty girls were sold on the street for that price. \"Well, I'll take it.\"Robb reached into the pocket of his jeans and felt something wrong. If he thought about it correctly, a gold coin is worth a hundred silver coins, but he didn\u2019t have as many as five hundred silver coins. He has only spent two days in this world, with most of that time spent in laziness, so he didn\u2019t have the time to make money. It was the pile of silver coins that Gorda gave him. He didn\u2019t even have to count the pile of silver coins, but he knew that it was less than five hundred.This is a bit embarrassing!Robb frowned, \u201cCan you give me a discount?\u201dThe merchant saw his movements and expressions and immediately understood, \u201cWell\u2026 Mr. Robb, I can\u2019t make her cheaper. I spent a lot of money to buy her from her aunt. I\u2019ll exchange someone cheaper instead.\u201dThen he winked, and the two servants pushed the girl back into the yard, intending to change her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11: I have to buy herWhen the girl was about to be pushed out, her expression suddenly became very sad. It turned out that earlier, when she just stood there, though she didn't dare to speak, she had been secretly looking at Robb, seeing that he was so young and good-looking, and a handsome blonde. She thought in her heart that it was better to be sold to serve such a master than a fat noble.Moreover, she also heard the merchant say, \"The priest of the Church of Light,\" which made her feel better about Robb. In the hearts of the poor, the Church of Light is the messenger of the God of Light and a synonym for salvation. The priest of the Church of Light must be good.Of course, this is just what the little girl naively thought. If a modern person were to understand it, it\u2019s a medieval religious organization, hehe! The priest is such a creature, hehe!In short, the girl was sincerely looking forward to being bought by Robb, and now seeing that the deal hadn\u2019t been completed, tears started pouring from her eyes, and she stumbled pitifully as the two servants pushed her.\"Wait!\" Robb said, \"I want her. You don't need to replace her.\"The expression on the girl's face immediately turned into an expression of ecstasy, and the two servants who pushed her dared not push anymore and froze in place.\"But.\" The merchant hesitated and said, \"You don't seem to be satisfied with the price\u2026.\"The merchant was quite euphemistic and did not say the words \"you can't afford to pay,\" saying that you were not satisfied with the price, which saved Robb's face.However, no matter how euphemistic this is, it still sounds upsetting.Robb\u2019s face sank, \"I'm satisfied with the price now. I must buy this girl for not a penny less than five gold coins.\"An awkward smile showed on the merchant's face: \"That\u2026 are you planning to\u2026.\"Robb said, \"just put it bluntly. How will I get the money?\u201dThe merchant laughed awkwardly.Robb put a hand on his chin, \u201cLast night, you bought double-legged flying dragon skin from us. Do you still have it?\u201dThe merchant nodded, \u201cIt\u2019s still there!\u201dRobb said, \u201cWell, you bought it from us with two hundred silver coins. I\u2019ll use two hundred silver coins right now to buy it back. It should be fine.\u201dThe merchant nodded and said, \"Of course, you can. The goods haven't been sold yet. So I haven\u2019t incurred any extra expenses yet. So there's no real problem with you buying it back for its original price. I'm not the kind of black-hearted merchant that charges more than necessary. But\u2026. don't you happen to be a little short on money? Buying back this skin is not only useless but will also reduce the money you currently own. won't it\u2026.\"\"Don't worry about it, and bring me the dragon skin.\" Robb took out a handful of silver coins from his pocket and counted two hundred silver coins on the table. Sure enough, he had less than five hundred silver coins in his pocket, but he still had another two hundred. After taking out the money, his trouser pocket completely shrunk, and it no longer had a big bulge.The merchant waved his hand, and a servant went into a nearby room and soon carried a large circle of skin. It was the dragon skin of the double-legged Flying Dragon yesterday, green, thick, and with a very heavy texture. It is a material for making leather armor because not only does it defend against sword attacks, but it also has a certain degree of magic resistance.\"Lend me a quiet room and give me a minute,\" Robb said.He nodded, \"Oh, please feel free to use the extra room there.\"Robb picked up the dragon skin, took the salt bag he bought for cooking the wild board, went into the extra room, and locked the door tightly.The merchant intently looked at the locked door and said with a questioning look, \"What on earth is he doing?\"Entering the room, Robb threw the heavy dragon skin on the ground, creating a dull sound. Then, he picked up the salt bag he had just bought, opened the bag, grabbed a handful of it, and sprinkled it on the dragon skin.Occupation Transfer \u2013 Leather Maker!Select material, one \"Double-legged flying dragon skin,\" select material, two \"Salt,\" Synthesis!Create, \u201cAged Double-legged flying dragon skin\u201d!Choose an item - \u201cFlying Dragon Leather Armor\u201d, using the material, one \u201cAged Double-legged flying dragon skin\u201d.Production Initiated!Master Leather Maker Skill Effect \u2013 Physical and magical defense is increased by 50% compared to normal flying dragon leather armor.Randomly enchanted \"Agility of a Flying Dragon\" effect: +20% attack speed, +15% movement speed.Production complete, item obtained \u2013 Flying Dragon Leather Armor!The flying dragon skin that Robb has just thrown on the ground has disappeared and been replaced by a flying dragon leather armor, glittering green light. Ordinary flying dragon leather armor doesn't produce this kind of glittering green light. This is a special effect only \"enchanted\" equipment possesses. The flying dragon leather armor not only has the same lines as an ordinary flying dragon leather armor but also carries an extra row of magical lines engraved on it because of the \"enchantment.\" It looks both beautiful and mysterious.If it\u2019s in the game, the item will have the \u201cagile\u201d prefix, but there is no such thing in the real world. It will only be called \"flying dragon leather armor.\" There will not be any prefixes.Robb took the dragon leather armor in his hand, pushed open the door, and went out.Outside the room, the merchant was confused, and the girl looked anxious. The both of them were waiting for Robb to come out, but neither expected that Robb would come out with flying dragon leather armor.As soon as Robb shook his hand, the flying dragon leather armor flew in a parabola mid-air and landed on the table in front of the merchant with a bang, shaking the entire table.Then Robb sat across the table, raised his legs, with his toes swaying in the air, and said lightly, \"You are a merchant. You should know the goods. Help me see how much this flying dragon leather armor can sell for.\"\"Huh\u2026 Huh\u2026? Where did you get the flying dragon leather armor? In that room. \" The merchant was shocked and stunned. That small room didn't even have a window. Where did Robb get that leather armor? Is it made of the double-legged flying dragon skin that he just carried? That\u2019s impossible!Fresh dragon skin can't be used to make armor immediately. It needs to be aged and dried. This process lasts several days. Then it takes a lot of days for a leather maker to cut, grind, sew, polish, and go through countless procedures before it becomes wearable leather armor. How could it have been done so quickly?He could only think that Robb used some secret trick in that room! Yes, it must\u2019ve been some trick!Robb knocked on the table and said, \"Hey, don't stay dazed. Just look at how much this dragon leather armor is worth. Don't be distracted.\"\"Oh, sorry.\" The merchant hurriedly stretched out his hand and gently stroked the flying dragon leather armor on the table. At the same time, he observed it carefully and was startled when he looked at it. The flying dragon leather armor was well made, and its craftsmanship was simply miraculous. This definitely wasn\u2019t just made on the spur on the moment. With this exquisite craftsmanship, it can be guaranteed that it is more durable than ordinary flying dragon leather armor, and of course, its defense ability is better.Moreover, this flying dragon leather armor also possesses \"enchantments.\" As a small merchant with limited knowledge, he didn\u2019t recognize the extra row of magical lines on his leather armor at all, so he couldn\u2019t guess the effect of the \"enchantment,\" but only by looking at the intensity of the glittering green light, he knew that it must be some top-class enchantment. The kind of thing that shocked even the skies.The merchant almost knelt on the spot!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 12": "Chapter 12: How much is this armor worth?Robb, \u201cI said, can you please stop being in a daze and answer the question I asked you! How much is this armor worth?\u201dRobb still doesn't know the pricing system of this world. After all, prices vary between the different game servers, let alone different worlds.\u201cHey?\u201d As soon as the merchant woke up, he quickly looked up, sat up with his back straight, and said solemnly, \"Sorry, Mr. Robert, I was fascinated by it by accident because of the workmanship of this flying dragon leather armor is so excellent... Oh, I swear I've never seen such exquisite craftsmanship in my life. This is at least the work of a master-level leather maker.Robb thought, \u201cThis merchant is a little discerning, but after all, he is still a small businessman who is still playing around. I am afraid he has not seen much of the world. A grandmaster obviously made this, but he says it is \"at least the master level.\" that is to say, his appraisal ability only works till the master level, but he can't understand the excellent equipment above it.Robb knocked on the table. \"You're half right, but not accurate enough.\" This armor is indeed above the master level, but to be exact, it is made by a 'Grandmaster leather craftsman.' \"\"Grand. Grand. Grandmaster? \" The merchant was so frightened that his chin almost fell unto the table. There were only two or three grandmaster leather makers on the entire continent. It was rare to see that this priest named Robert threw one out, my God.Robb said, \"Well, talking about it now, how much can it sell?\"The merchant wiped the sweat forming on his forehead and whispered, \"Athough a Grandmaster leather maker made it, its material is, after all, the skin of a double-legged flying dragon. As you know, double-legged flying dragon skin is not considered a high-class material. Although it is superior to wild boar and lizard skin, it is much inferior to a real dragon, behemoth, leopard, and other monster skin, so it is much worse. It can't be a real artifact. Therefore, it can\u2019t be a real artifact.\"Robb nodded. \"Correct, that makes sense.\"The merchant said, \"It will not be favored by the richest people, but will only be favored by some middle-class aristocrats and adventurers, who can't afford to pay a lot of money, so\u2026 if this leather armor is engraved by the name of the leather maker himself, which can prove the famous master\u2019s identity made it, it should be worth 500 gold coins. \"Robb interrupted him, \"there is no need for an engraving. The man who made this armor is not a famous leather maker.\" He is an eccentric hermit who does not like to communicate with others. He is unknown to the world\u2026 so there is no identity engraving on the leather armor at all.\"\"Oh, an unknown master, then it can only be worth two hundred gold coins at most.\" The merchant said, \"And even at 200, it may not be sold, because buyers will suspect whether it is really made by grandmaster leather maker. As you know, most people are not as good as I am at appraising items. They can only judge their value by looking at who built them. A discerning merchant like me can only understand whether it\u2019s at least made by a master, but I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s made by a grandmaster. So.\"\"I see.\" Robb said with a smile: So, after saying so much useful and useless stuff, you are probably thinking in your heart about the price you will buy from me and how you\u2019ll profit the most, right?\" So, you want to buy it at a master level price, then take it to the capital of the saints, and sell it at a grandmaster price to make a lot of money. \"The merchant's face flushed: \"Sorry, this is the instinctive reaction of a merchant.\"Robb said, \"So, at what price do you want to buy it from me?\"The merchant laughed twice: \"One hundred gold coins.\"Robb said, \"Then you\u2019ll take it to the capital of the saints and sell it for two hundred gold coins and make a profit of a hundred. It's a good business.\"The merchant's face turned red, and said, \"Mr. Robb, don't I have to pay for transportation? If you carry it to the holy capital to sell it yourself, you'll have to travel a long way, and then, you\u2019ll have to look everywhere for a buyer, won\u2019t you? \"As he said this, he looked a little guilty at Robb and thought, \"It looks like he's going to raise the price a little more.\"However, Robb didn\u2019t. Although he was mocking the merchant for trying to make a lot of profit, he had no intention of bargaining at all. To him, such flying dragon leather armor was just an ordinary item. He\u2019s too lazy to bother for such a minor thing to waste his precious time. Time is something that should be used for laziness, not for doing things.He said bluntly, \"I'll tell you what, if you give me a hundred gold coins, plus this little girl, this flying dragon leather armor will be yours.\"\"Hey? Really!\" The merchant was overjoyed and hurriedly decided, \"Then it's settled.\"He seemed afraid of Robb changing his mind and waved to his two servants, who pushed the little girl. She ran behind Robb and stood motionless behind him.[Robb acquired a maid].Robb glanced at the little girl's face by turning her head and saw that she was obviously relieved. Her eyes were filled with joy and she seemed satisfied that she had been sold to Robb.Robb realized that being the priest of the Church of Light was quite useful. Even buying a servant would make the servant feel very happy. He might as well use this identity in the future B that the status of the priest of the Church of Light was really very useful, and even buying a servant would make the servant feel very happy. He might as well maintain this identity in the future. There was no real need for him to cut off this status unless it was as a last resort.The merchant returned to his room, soon took a bag out and put it in front of Robb, opened the bag full of golden coins: \"Here are a hundred gold coins. Count them.\"\"No need to count.\" Robb put away the bag and said with a smile, \"I don't think you dare play tricks in front of me.\"\"No one dares to deceive the priest of the Church of Light!\"\"Well, it was a pleasant deal.\" Robb stood up and said, \"I'm returning to the chapel. I guess you'll make a lot of money in the capital of the Saints soon. Goodbye.\"The merchant smiled and said, \"Mr. Robb, there is one thing I really don't understand. You\u2026How did you make this flying dragon leather armor in that small room? Where did the big roll of dragon skin go? It couldn\u2019t have been made in such a short time, right? It is impossible to do so in terms of time. \"Robb lowered his voice and said mysteriously, \"I'll only tell you. I won't tell anyone. Just now, after I entered the small room, I immediately used a transmission scroll (TL: Yes, the one that takes a long time to activate) to teleport a hundred miles away, I looked for my grandmaster leather maker friend and gave him the double-legged dragon skin. Then he gave me a flying dragon leather armor, and then I sent it back.\"\"Wow, I see.\" The merchant's eyes were burning again, \"That\u2026.. Can you look for him for help in making anything in the future? I\u2026. I\u2019m willing to buy for a long time! \"Robb laughed: \"it depends on whether my friend is in a good mood. I'll tell you that he is a very lazy man who has long disdained to make these worthless objects.\"\"Oh, really? What a pity!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 13": "Chapter 13: Everyone\u2019s fatherRobb walked out of the merchant's house with the maid she had just acquired.The thin blonde girl followed him in small steps, with her head and hands down.\"What's your name?\" Robb asked.\"Please give me a name.\" The little girl bowed her head.Robb was amused and was about to say, \"From here on, you\u2019ll be called Rem (TL: From Re:Zero),\" but after thinking about it, he took it back and said, \"I don't want to erase the name your parents gave you. It is the most precious gift your parents have given you and will stay with you for the rest of your life, so I want to hear your real name, not the name I gave you.\" The name I\u2019ll give you may not even be something you\u2019ll like, but you\u2019ll still have to stick with it, which may be quite depressing for you.\u201dWith that simple sentence, the girl suddenly burst into tears. After several seconds, she calmed down and said in a shallow voice, \"Thank you, Master. My name is Lillian.\"\"Very good, then I'll call you Lillian from now on.\" Robb smiled and said, \"My name is Robb.\"\"I will remember your honorable name.\"\"Well, you don\u2019t have to be this polite.\"\"Yes, master!\"After six sentences, Robb realized that the conversation couldn\u2019t continue. The maid acted like she didn\u2019t want to talk to you and threw a special phrase at the end of the chat-\"OK.\"Forget it, there will be plenty more chances, and it's indeed very difficult to chat with a stranger of the opposite sex immediately. Robb smiled and said, \"That\u2019s all. Let's go and get you new clothes. Your clothes are dirty and full of holes. Let's change them.\"\"Yes, master!\"The two went to the cloth shop in the center of the town. As soon as they walked in, Robb was recognized by the shopkeeper. Westwind town was too small. Last night when Robb and Gorda came back with the skin of the double-legged dragon, almost the whole town remembered his face, and after that dinner, everyone knew that he would settle down in Westwind town and manage the chapel in the town.Robb immediately received a \"Welcome, welcome, a warm welcome\" from the shopkeeper. He didn't stop there and relentlessly shouted \"My Father\" to Robb, just like how Westerners called priests. Robb, taking advantage of the shopkeeper, waved to the shopkeeper and said, \"God bless you, my son!\"He suddenly found that he would be the father of everyone in Westwind town! He became a part of the older generation, whether it is a middle-aged man or an old man, anyone who sees him has to call him father obediently, and Robb has to call the person son. Moreover, whenever it happens, the people would happily listen...However, the Westwind town really is a fussy place. If a father wants to take his son's things, he has to pay money.Westwind town itself doesn\u2019t have the ability to produce cloth. Merchants from larger cities ship the cloth here, so the price is very expensive, much more expensive than cloth bought locally in the said larger cities.Lillian's eyes were locked on the coarse white linen in the store. She looked at the price tag and rolled out her tongue in fear, thinking to herself, \"How expensive!\" Although his Master is a priest of the Church of Light with a benevolent and charitable nature, he must consider whether such an expensive piece of cloth is worth buying for a servant.As soon as she thought of it, Rob put his hand on a roll of white cotton, which was several times more expensive than the coarse white linen, and with a snap of his finger, a gold coin flew out and landed in the shopkeeper's hand. \"I\u2019ll take this roll of white cotton. I\u2019ll also take this can of black dye next to it,\" he said, picking up the cloth in one hand and the can of dye in the other, and walked away.The shopkeeper shouted at the back, \"You only need 10 silver coins for that roll of cotton cloth. The dye is cheaper. You don't need as many gold coins. Please stop. I'll give you your change...\"Robb smiled and said, \"give it to my maid.\" Then, he turned around and left the store.The shopkeeper called Lillian. \"Hey, are you the maid that Mr. Robb just bought?\"Lillian nodded.\u201cCome here! Help take your Master's change back.\"Lillian held out her pair of small hands and spread them out evenly. The shopkeeper put 82 silver coins in her hand and warned her, \"This much money, you, little maid, don't think about stealing it. It won't do you any good. Westwind town is on the border, and it is full of monsters outside. If you dare to steal the money and run away, you\u2019ll have no choice but to die. Even if you reach another town or country, the Church of Light will be able to catch you back. \"Lillian bowed her head and said obediently, \"I won't run away. Master is a good person. I will follow him well.\"In fact, even if the shopkeeper didn\u2019t remind her, she knew that almost all the residents of Westwind Town, a town with a population of only a thousand people, knew each other. If she escaped from Robb, it would not take long for her to be found. Not to mention, leaving town is basically a death sentence. I don't know how many monsters are loitering outside, waiting for stupid guys to run into the mountains to let them have a good meal.If she wanted to survive, there was no other way but to listen to Robb.In fact, from the moment her parents died, and her aunt adopted her, she knew that she had to listen to others in order to live. The only difference was who she had to listen to. She was lucky to be able to follow a priest who represented \"light.\"Lillian came out of the shop with 82 silver coins in her hands, being careful not to drop them, and quickly caught up with Robb and followed him, \"Master, this is your change from the shopkeeper.\"\"Oh, keep it.\" Without looking back, Robb said, \"Here's your pocket money.\"\"Scared?\" Lillian was startled. (TL: It doesn't really make sense for her to say that in that situation ngl)Seeing the little girl's shocked and bewildered look, Robb had no choice but to change his words, \"I want you to buy a lot of things for me. I'll put the money with you for the time being.\"\"whoo-hoo!\" Lillian heaved a sigh of relief.Although the girl didn't say much, her facial expressions were very interesting, so Robb found himself to be quite fond of teasing her.After a while, the two returned to the chapel.In the eyes of ordinary people, a chapel is a sacred place. Lillian prayed at the door for a long time before she dared to set foot inside. She felt quite happy to think she would be living here in the future. There are no abusive aunts here, and there is no need to worry about being sold to anyone. Her new owner seems to be a very gentle and good man too.Robb smiled and said, \"Lillian, come here. I'll help you make your new clothes first.\"\"Making clothes?\" When Lillian heard this, she exclaimed, \"Ah,\" Not to mention that the material Robb was going to use was expensive cotton. The most incredible thing for Lillian was that Robb said, \"I'll help you make it.\" she couldn't help but be anxious, \"Master, how can that be? Please let me tailor the clothes myself.\"Robb rejected her solemnly, \"No, the style of the clothes you\u2019ll make certainly wouldn\u2019t satisfy me.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 14": "Chapter 14: I'll make you a maid's costume.Robb unexpectedly said that the clothes Lillian would make wouldn't satisfy him.The latter's face obviously raised an expression of being \"unconvinced.\" If this person were not her Master, she would probably be angry, but she dared not be angry with her Master, so she could only pout and say, \"Lillian is very good at making clothes.\"Robb smiled and said, \"It wouldn\u2019t be as good as mine.\"The corner of the little girl's mouth raised stubbornly, and she raised her voice with a little power, \u201cMaster! Lillian is really good at making clothes.\"Robb smiled, \"Well, let's make clothes together and compare them to see which looks better.\"\"Good!\" Lillian said with a very serious look, with little cheeks bulging.Robb brought tools such as scissors, needles, and thread from the mayor, split the large roll of white cotton cloth in half, gave one half to Lillian, and took the other. He then divided the black dye into two. \"Now I'll count to three, then we\u2019ll start working,\" he said with a laugh.\u201cOkay!\u201d\u201c1\u20262\u20263\u2026 START!\u201dRobb shouted to start, but he didn\u2019t move yet. He looked at Lillian with his head tilted to see what his new maid was capable of.Lillian lowered her head and began to work. She first picked up a small stone on the ground and drew a few lines on the cloth, all of which were drawn on the edges of the cloth. It was obvious that she was designing how to cut the least amount of cloth. This is \"expensive\" cotton cloth, not the cheap coarse linen. So, she is very reluctant to waste it.After drawing the lines, she began to cut, and with the pair of small scissors in her hand, she cut and she cut. She cut the cloth into two: the costume's front and back parts. Then, she took out a needle and thread and began to sew the front and back pieces together.Robb secretly praised that she was really a hard-working and clever little girl, but unfortunately, the style of clothes you made was really not to my liking. What kind of clothes are these? They resemble the outfit of prisoners with that tubed skirt. I will never admit that someone who wears something like that is a maid.Never mind, she\u2019s just a woman from a small border town. She has probably never seen the gorgeous maid outfit in my previous world. Even if she did, she wouldn\u2019t be able to make such a dress with that complicated of a design?Watching the little girl working for a long time, it was not until she sewed the last row of stitches that Robb began to put the cotton cloth side by side with the black dye and then changed his job to tailor.Choose an item -\"Maid outfit,\" select material, one \"White cotton cloth\", select material, two \"Black dye.\"Production Initiated!System Tip: The clothes you make are purely for aesthetics. The defense will be constant at 10.0, and no additional defense or enchantments from your grandmaster tailor skills will be given.Production complete!Robb's hands shook with a bang, and the maid costume appeared, the same style as Rem\u2019s (TL: From Re: Zero, I\u2019m assuming), with a black skirt dotted with decorative white edges. It hits well. It would truly be a man's ultimate dream if it were on a blue-haired girl.And Lillian, who was next to him, finally sewed the tube skirt, shook it open like a prisoner's suit, turned around, smiled at Robb, and said, \"Look, Master, I've done it. I've sewed it very...\"Before she finished talking, Lillian saw the maid\u2019s costume in Robb's hand.It is no exaggeration to say that since Lillian was brought into the world by her parents, she had never seen any beautiful clothes because her range of activities was still very small and had only lived in a small town near the border, where she came from. Then she was sold to a merchant and was brought to Westwind town. The merchant's wife wore the most beautiful dress she had seen before, but it wasn\u2019t as beautiful as the one in Robb's hand.Lillian fell to the ground with a \u201cpuff\u201d and said with difficulty, \"I may not be a qualified maid. My clothes are not as good as those made by my Master.\"\"Haha, don't be sad.\" Robb smiled at her and said, \"There have been countless professional tailors who lost before me. You are not a professional tailor yet. There is no need for you to compete with me.\"\"Huh? Hey, huh? \" Lillian looked confused and could not understand why her Master wanted to compare clothes with other tailors. Isn\u2019t master a priest of the Holy Church of Light? What is the point of such a noble man learning to tailor clothes?\"Well, don't stay dazed.\" Robb said with a smile, \"Take a shower and put on the new costume. The tubed skirt outfit you made yourself will be used as sleepwear. Just wear my maid costume for outdoor activities. I will make another set of the same style so that you can stay hygienic and change.\"\"Thank you, master.\" Lillian happily took over the maid costume. In fact, all the girls love to be beautiful. In the past, there were no conditions, but now they need to wear beautiful dresses. There is no reason for her to be unhappy.Of course, the happiest thing for her is still being able to meet her gentle and kind Master. He wasn't only kind to her but also willing to spend so much money on her. A humble maid like herself should only wear the cheap coarse linen. Noble families had a lot of servants, all of whom usually wore dirty dresses all year round.Unexpectedly, her Master made her clothes out of expensive cotton cloth and will make another beautiful dress for her. She can also wear one as a nightdress, which many ordinary girls, let alone servants, couldn't enjoy.Although the chapel was small, it had several rooms because the accommodation of priests, nuns, servants, and other people had been considered during the construction, so Robb didn't have to decide on them. And Lillian found the servant room herself.However, the mayor only arranged daily necessities for Robb's room, so the other rooms were all empty.Lillian looked at the unfurnished servant's room and thought, \"I have to get some hay and lay it on the ground. Otherwise, it will be hard at night.After taking a bath and changing into Robb's maid costume, she walked cleanly into the yard. There was a feeling of comfort spreading all over the body saying that her new life had begun and that it would be a lot better than when I followed my aunt.Then, she saw her Master limping on a stone stool in the yard. He was in a state of relative stillness.Lillian hurriedly said, \"Ah?\" Master! Are you not feeling well? \"\"Not really! I'm just too lazy to move,\" Robb replied.As It turns out, Robb has just entered a state of laziness!After being busy for a long time, he finally solved his maid problem. Now that a beautiful girl is helping him run errands, he can confidently be lazy, so of course, now, he is too lazy to move. While slumped on the stone stool, he looks at Lillian, who has just come out of the shower. After taking a shower, the little girl's skin seemed snow-white, with blond hair draped behind her head and a maid dress colored in black and white. It was really beautiful and pleasing to the eye.Such a lovely girl can be bought for just five gold coins. Feudalism is so... wonderful.There wasn\u2019t such a good thing in the game!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15: Life seems interesting.Her little action made Robb feel that it was really worth going out just now. At the same time, it made him feel a little guilty about his mother in his previous world because whenever he pulled an all-nighter because of grinding in the game, his mother would do her best and prepare a cup of water for him to drink. Thus, he never became thirsty.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, master?\u201d Lillian was a little worried when she saw the tears glittering in her master\u2019s eyes.\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Robb hid his expression and pointed at the cup of water on the table and said, \u201cLillian, let me tell you, it is unhealthy and easy to get sick when you drink well water like this. All kinds of parasites will enter your belly. When you want to drink water, boil it, so the parasites would be killed off.\u201d\u201cWhat are parasites?\u201d Lillian asked.Robb, \u201c\u2026\u201dWell, though the medieval west was often thought of as being well-educated and majestic because of \"Swordsmanship and Magic,\" it was actually quite barbaric and oblivious to most things in the world. Well, some things are better slowly changed, Robb said patiently, \"It's a tiny, invisible bug. It's in this water. Drinking it could give you diarrhea, so you'll have to boil the water to kill them.\"\"Wow, so the reason I got diarrhea back then was because of this?\" The funniest thing about Lillian is her facial expressions. Her facial expressions always reveal her emotions. And now, she's looking at the cup of water on the table with an expression of absolute disgust.\"Well, there's no need to be so disgusted. After it boils, it will be a normal cup of good water. Go boil it.\"\"Master... But\u2026 We don't have a pot here. \" Lillian said, \"I just went to the kitchen and found a shortage of utensils.\"\"Oh, that's true. I just moved in today, so I don't have anything yet.\" Robb then said with a smile, \"So go shopping first and buy everything you need in your daily life. Speaking of which, your room doesn\u2019t have a bed nor bedding yet, so you should go and buy it while you\u2019re there.\"Pausing there, Robb thought of something, adding, \"By the way, pots and pans are all heavy. It's very difficult for a girl to carry it back. Don't act brave, and remember to spend some money to ask a few townspeople to help you carry things back.\"Lillian froze, and her expression started. And then she instantly looked like she was about to cry.When she stayed with her aunt, she had no bedding, so she could only sleep on a haystack in the stables. Just now, in the servant's room, she was thinking of getting some hay for her to sleep on. She didn\u2019t expect that her master would ask her to buy some bedding. And when she thought she might not be able to carry these things alone, he asked her to pay for someone to help her bring them back.Her master is not only gentle and kind but also considerate, caring for his servants to the point of madness. Being bought by him was truly the greatestRobb reached into his pocket, grabbed some gold coins, and handed them over to Lillian.She shook her head abruptly. \"Master, I still have 82 silver coins left from when we bought the cloth, which is enough to buy a lot of things. There is no need to give me any more money. I will buy all our necessities now. I\u2026 I will do my best.\"She moved her legs and ran as if she were flying out of the yard. Robb sat motionless on the stone bench and only shouted, \"Slow down, don't fall.\"\"Mm-hmm!\"The little maid didn\u2019t have the klutz\u2019s attribute, falling or tripping. She ran fast and steadily. The maid wearing white and black, flew like a butterfly. In a blink of an eye, she slowly disappeared. Seeing her lovely back, Robb felt more and more that the different world seemed to be becoming more and more interesting. Of course, it's just that life is interesting. He still wasn\u2019t interested in doing strange adventures.That evening, Lillian came back with a large group of townspeople.Each townsman helped her carry a lot of things, including bedding, pillows, pots, pans, knives and forks, tables, chairs, candles, sesame oil, seasonings, tea, dried wood, vegetables, and beef. Even a pile of farm tools such as hoes, spades, and sickles were brought back.Robb, who was addicted to games and used to rely entirely on his mother to take care of his daily life, finally realized how troublesome it was to build a family. He could not help thanking his parents in his previous world, and then he secretly congratulated himself that the first thing he bought was the maid; otherwise, he would be crazy to take care of these messy daily necessities.In the evening, the sun began to set, and smoke rose from every household.There was smoke rising in the small chapel. Lillian was cooking on a fire.Holding a cup of black tea that Lillian had made for him, Robb continued to limp on the stone bench in the yard, lazy.After a long time, Lillian brought dinner to the table.Robb looked intently. My God, what the heck is this?What looked like a \"pot of soup\" on the table was 108000 miles worse than his previous world\u2019s soup. All kinds of strange ingredients floated in the soup. Robb glanced over and saw crushed pig bones, pig offal, mushrooms, and wild vegetables. In any case, all the ingredients present at home can be seen in this pot, and there are even pig intestines floating and sinking at the top of the pot. Not to mention, the pot gives off a very fishy smell.Robb pointed to the pot and asked in horror, \"Lillian, what do you call this? Dark cuisine?\"\"Huh? That's how everyone cooks. \" Lillian said, \"Haven\u2019t you eaten before, master?\"Pausing there, she suddenly realized she had made a mistake. She made soup that ordinary people often eat, that is, putting everything in a pot, but the nobles didn\u2019t seem to eat like this. They were much more fastidious. Her master is a priest of the Church of Light, so of course, he\u2019s a noble. He can't eat such food. (The medieval west ate such dishes. Unlike the Chinese, they didn't like making different kinds of food like fried pork liver. They prefer to chop up their ingredients and put them all in a big pot for soup. You all probably know the taste of boiled offal, and I\u2019m sure you couldn\u2019t handle it)Lillian said awkwardly, \"I. I don't know... How to make food for master.\"\"Oh, forget it! You haven\u2019t used up all the ingredients yet, right? \"\"There are still two large pieces of beef left. The beef is costly, so I didn't want to stew it with the cheaper ingredients. I wanted to dry it and turn it into beef jerky for preservation.\"\"Then bring them here,\" Robb then said, \"By the way, bring some mushrooms and some salt. Right, prepare two plates, knives, and forks.\u201dLillian obediently brought the ingredients and plates, knives, and forks.Robb changed his job to \u201cChef\u201d and started making steak with mushroom sauce, and in a blink of an eye, two steaks were placed on the stone table in front of him.Lillian saw that Robb didn't seem to do anything other than point at the ingredients. The ingredients synthesized into a beautiful dish within seconds, which was amazing. Wow, so this is the power of magic! However, should a noble thing such as magic be used on something so simple as cooking?Her mouth couldn\u2019t help but open so wide that she couldn't close it for a long time.Robb pointed at the chair on the opposite side of the stone table. \"Sit down and have steak with me. Here are exactly two, one for each of us.\"\"Ah?\" Lillian was startled. \"This\u2026 This is what nobles eat, right? I. I'll just drink the soup. \"\"That soup will be taken out and placed in the middle of the town. Whoever finds it appealing it will eat it. Our family will not eat that anymore. Just listen to me and eat the same thing as I do,\" Robb said commandingly.\"Yes, master!\" Lillian sat down carefully on the chair opposite Robb. Thanks to the fact that she was an unruly girl from a small town at the border, she didn\u2019t know much of the world. If she had been born in a big city and known certain rules and customs, she would never dare to sit at the same table with her master. She'll probably maintain respect and show her inferiority to Robb, which he hates.She picked up her knife and fork like Robb and thought to herself, \u201cIs this how nobles eat? Like her master, she pressed on the beef with the fork in her left hand and cut it using a knife with her right hand\u2026 Cut\u2026 Cut\u2026 Then, she used the fork in her left hand. Oops, no, that\u2019s too much power.\"Bang!\"The steak flew over the stone table and stuck to Robb's face, which was now covered with mushroom sauce.Robb put down his knife and fork and said sadly, \"Lillian!\"\"Master! I. I didn't mean to... Whoo. \" Lillian was so scared that she almost criedRobb shrugged and said, \"Don't be afraid. I'm not going to punish you. I just want to tell you that if you're not used to using a knife and fork, you can eat it with your hands. I don't mind.\"Lillian said timidly, \"Can I use my hands?\"\"Of course, you can!\"\"Wow, that would be great.\" Lillian was overjoyed, and with a smile on her face, she grabbed the steak in her hand and stuffed it into her mouth: \"Delicious, truly delicious\u2026 so it was true that food eaten by nobles is better than the soup.\"Robb pointed to the mushroom sauce on his face. \"Before you eat your steak, would you wash my face without a basin of water?\"\"Oh, dear! Master, I'll be right there. \"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 16": "Chapter 16: Return to your graveThe sky was dark. Most of the citizens of Westwind town have already fallen asleep, with only a few houses still lit.Robb took a big barrel, put it in the yard, and bathed.Truly, without a doubt, a warm bath must be done in a yard. Indoor bathing is depressing, but outdoor baths are comfortable. You can see the stars all over the sky, and the black pine mountain behind the chapel becomes a vast black silhouette with a great sense of gradation. At the same time, the wind flows across the water's surface and calmly brushes his head. It was indeed an indescribable sensation of comfortability.Additionally, the little maid was very happy. She wasn't shy when he entered the bath, but she turned her head when she saw Robb taking off his clothes. She waited until Robb sat in the water before moving and standing beside him with a bright red face.Whenever Robb said the water was getting cold, she ran to the kitchen, brought the hot water that had been boiling all this time, and gave it to Robb.Of course, he'll take his time in such a comfortable bath. Robb accidentally soaked for an hour. Lillian has already boiled two large pots of water, yet he still hasn't finished bathing.\"Master\u2026 When I went to the kitchen to fetch water... I heard a strange sound in the graveyard behind the chapel, rustling as if something was digging. \" When Lillian came back with the hot water this time, she had a frightened expression as if she was genuinely alarmed.Robb thought, \"It's normal for girls to be afraid of cemeteries!\"He smiled and comforted her, \"Don't be afraid, it's all right. Don't forget that I'm a priest. No undead will dare appear in front of me with the holy light in my hand.\"What he said reassured Lillian. With a Church of Light priest here, there was nothing to be afraid of. Speaking of which, cemeteries are built behind the church so that the souls of the dead can return to the God of Light as soon as possible which is more or less the reason \"light\" can be used to suppress the undead.She nodded and said, \"As long as master is around, I\u2019m not afraid.\"\"Of course, great!\"After soaking in the bath for a while, the water started becoming cold. Robb smiled, \"You have to heat up the water again.\"Lillian quickly ran into the kitchen again and soon came back with hot water with a frightened expression on her face, \"Master, there really is a sound coming from the cemetery. This time it is not only digging but also the kind... the kind that sounds like bones moving and cracking. It's so scary\u2026 Master\u2026 Would you like to have a look? \"\"I want to take a bath. I\u2019m too lazy to look. What bones are moving? At most, a few skeletons crawled out of the grave, that is to say, a skeleton king. It's no big deal.\"Listening to him downplay the situation, Lillian wept inside. She thought, \"Master if there really is a Skeleton King, the whole of Westwind town, oh, correction, a hundred miles near the vicinity of the town will be razed to the ground by the army of undead. How could you underestimate the appearance of a skeleton king?\"But\u2026 but\u2026\" Lillian then said. \"The cemetery is part of the chapel. If anything happens in the cemetery, your reputation will be tarnished.\u201dWhen she said that conflicted, Robb unexpectedly thought about it\u2026 huh? That's right. The cemetery is part of my property which is also my real estate. If something is suspicious in my most expensive real estate, it doesn't make sense for me not to take care of it.\"Well, let's just have a look then.\" Robb laid motionless in the barrel but secretly changed his job to \"Ranger\" and activated \"Detection.\"His vision expanded at once, detection could provide Robb with a field of vision of 5000 yards, and the Ranger had a passive called \"Night Vision,\" so the night didn't affect his vision.He looked far away at the cemetery on the hill behind the church.At a glance, he saw three tombstones tilted on the ground, three gloomy holes lay in front of the tombstone, and three skeletons were scraping dirt out of the hole as if they were trying to climb out.\"The skeleton really crawled out of the grave,\" Robb said.\"Ah? Aah! \" Lillian screamed, \"Skeleton?\"\"Don't yell. It's just a few skeletons. What\u2019s there to shout about.\" Robb then said, \"Forget it. After all, it's my real estate. I have to take care of it and return these skeletons back to their graves. If they run away, when the townspeople come to pay their respects, they\u2019ll realize that the remains of their loved ones are gone. Isn't it pitiful that they can't even pay their respects?\"Robb climbed out of the barrel, and Lillian hurriedly turned her head and handed over a piece of dry cotton cloth with her hands behind her. In fact, if she didn't turn her head, Robb would be shy. He was still just an eighteen-year-old virgin, and he couldn't bear to stand in front of the little girl naked, but the girl turned her head away first, so he managed to stay calm. Playing rogue still depends on who first surrenders!He took the cotton cloth and wiped his body. He wasn't wearing his previous T-shirts and jeans anymore. Ordinary people liked wearing loose clothes after taking a bath. He took a pair of \"Tube pajamas\" from Lillian and wore it on his body: \"All right! I'll go to the cemetery now. Lillian, wait here if you're afraid. \"\"Ah? I... I want to follow\u2026. \" Lillian then said, \"Staying here makes me more afraid. What if a skeleton suddenly climbs out when you leave?\u201d\"Nonsense! Skeletons can't climb out of anywhere! \" Robb smiled and said, \"If a skeleton wants to climb out, you must first have to have a skeleton buried underground.\"\"I don't know if skeletons are buried in the front yard\u2026.\"\"Whatever, just come along. By the way, bring a shovel; we'll bury something later.\" Robb doesn't mind being followed by a girl; rather, he likes to be followed by a girl. It was originally a tedious task, but it would be much more interesting if he did it with a girl. The girl was yelling 666 behind him, which is much more comfortable than a few stingy men shouting the same thing. (TL: She's yelling 666, meaning she's hoping that everything will go smoothly)Lillian followed cautiously, holding the shovel, and soon, they arrived at the cemetery. The cemetery was small, with only a few hundred graves. This is because Westwind town was small with a small population and short history.When Robb walked into the cemetery, he saw that not only the three tombs he had seen but also dozens of tombs were empty. Looking at the marks on the holes they dug out of; he realized that they'd been digging and climbing out for several days. He wasn't even at Westwind town yet when they started.He didn't care about it before, so he didn't talk about it. But now that he's here, he obviously won't allow them to crawl out of their graves anymore. Later, he finally came across a skeleton that was crawling out of its grave.Seeing a living skeleton crawling out of the grave, Lillian was frightened and grabbed the hem of Robb's clothes, trembling all over.Robb knew at a glance that she was barely afraid. It was just that she had been inflicted with \"Fear.\" Undead creatures all carry a certain degree of \"Aura of Fear,\" which can scare mentally weak people. The more powerful the undead, the stronger its \"Aura of Fear\" is, and the greater its range.The reason why Lillian looks like this is because of the aura of fear. Although a skeleton soldier is one of the weakest undead monsters, it can still frighten Lillian a little, but not to the extent of making her run away.Robb took her hand with his left hand and used the holy magic \"Dispel.\" Afterward, a stream of warm light dispelled her fear without a trace. Lillian\u2019s mind cleared up, and her trembling body finally stabilized.Robb squatted down with both hands on his chest to look at the skeleton crawling out in front of him.The skeleton was digging with both its hands, expanding the mouth of the hole, and crawling forward little by little. Then, it finally noticed him squatting in front of it, a blonde man in tube pajamas.The skeleton glared at Robb with its hollow eyes, then it opened its mouth and roared, \"Cracking!\" Creaking! \"\"Crack your head.\" Robb then put his hand on the skull of the skull and pressed on it hard: \"Return to your grave and never come out and frighten my little maid.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 17": "Chapter 17: NecromancerLillian was startled to see her master reach out and press on the skeleton\u2019s head. \"Be careful, master. It will grab you.\"As soon as she spoke, the skeleton's hand caught on to Robb by his ankle and tried to drag him underground.Robb could smash the skeleton to pieces at any time, but he knows that the skeleton was once a relative of a townsman, so it wouldn\u2019t be good to destroy it. The townspeople call him father, so he had to pay a little attention and care to their affairs.Thus, he had to give up on using the skill: Meteor Rain, Rending Earth, and Crushing Thunder. He'll be a little gentle and at least let his brother skeleton keep its whole body.As soon as the skeleton was about to drag Robb, it felt a terrible force on its skull: the arm strength of the man in front of him. He seemed to have pressed lightly, but its power was overwhelming. The skeleton's bones cracked a few times, trying to resist, but how could bear it. He was returned to his grave in an instant.He wanted to climb out again, but when he saw Robb pointing at him, a golden light flew out of his fingertips. It was the holy magic \"Dispel.\" The skeleton suddenly lost all its strength and returned to its inanimate state in the grave.Robb clapped his hands, turned to Lillian next to him, and said, \"Lillian, bury it!\"\"Yes, master!\" Lillian quickly used the shovel to push the dirt left on both sides of the hole, which the skeleton used to climb out and covered it up again. She was a little afraid that the skeleton would climb up again, so she was ready to escape, but the skeleton was completely motionless and was obediently buried.Robb had already found a second skeleton, half its body climbing out of the ground. As soon as Robb pressed on it with his hand, the skeleton returned to its grave, and then after using \"Dispel,\" he said, \"Lillian, after burying that, come and bury this.\"\"Yes, master!\"Around this time, a third skeleton had crawled out of its grave. He shook the dirt on him off and looked around. This guy was different from the two skeletons just now. He seemed sane enough to understand what was happening around him. It then turned its head and glared at Robb with its hollow eyes.Seeing Robb getting closer and closer, apparently, to return it to its grave, it suddenly broke its left arm with its right. Then, it held its left arm in his right hand like a stick and sternly looked at Robb.\"Well!\" Robb shrugged at the skeleton: \"Don't hurt yourself. I can leave your body intact if you put your weapon down and talk well.\"\"Young man\u2026Don't\u2026 Mind your own business\u2026 \" The skeleton spoke unexpectedly. It was clear that there was only one bone and that it didn\u2019t have a mouth or any other organ used to talk, but it could speak.Robb saw that two small flames were burning in the hollow eye sockets of the skeleton, which looked like a pair of eye beads, and it was evident that a soul had settled in the skeleton. It was no longer as simple as the two skeletons that were manipulated by some simple puppet tricks. This time, a powerful soul is controlling the skeleton's movements.\"Oh! A necromancer? \" Robb looked to his left and right. The hillside behind the cemetery was dark, and it was hard to see anything clearly. And even while using detection, its night vision, and its 5000 yards range, he still couldn't see anyone. Thinking about it carefully, there must be a necromancer manipulating the skeletons nearby.\"How can you tell that I\u2019m a necromancer?\" The skeleton was surprised: \"If so, you should know I am not one you can afford to offend. Mind your own business.\" Since Robb was in his pajamas, he couldn\u2019t see Robb as a powerful person; so he spoke with arrogance.Robb said, \"You ran into my backyard and tried to steal the bones of my sons' relatives, and you tell me to mind my own business? Damn retard, I went into your backyard to secretly dig your buried potatoes. Can you ignore me?\"The skeleton recognized Robb's identity from his sentence, \"Damn it, are you a priest of this chapel?\"Robb said, \"You deserve to die. Your whole family deserves to die.\"\"This is obviously an empty chapel. When did you come here?\" The skeleton looked a little angry.\"Unfortunately, today.\" Robb said, \"Don't you scout the location first before you steal? Oh, right, your main body is hidden very far away, so you couldn't even scout the place. You just used things like magic arrays arranged here in advance to manipulate them from a distance, right? I'll look for it carefully later. I should be able to find your magic array in several areas of the graveyard. \"Listening to his words, the necromancer who manipulated the skeleton understood that he messed with someone he couldn't afford! This isn\u2019t good. The skeleton had no choice but to strike, or he'll have to give up on all the graves of this village.He manipulated the skeleton and waved its left arm before rushing at Robb.However\u2026.Robb used \"Dispel,\" and the skeleton softly fell at his feet.Obviously, the necromancer didn't have the time to refine this skeleton into a real undead monster. If it was refined, simple using dispel wouldn't be able to stop it, at least with holy magic. But now, because it is only being controlled remotely by a necromancer, it's a soulless skeleton, not a skeleton soldier!This magic used to control skeletons remotely is, in theory, just a buff. One dispel is enough to clear the buff effects.If the necromancer\u2019s main body is here, he might be able to play with Robb a little. But with a remotely controlled skeleton, it wasn\u2019t even worth playing with for Robb. It only takes a normal dispel to deal with it. Even an ordinary priest can do it.When the skeleton fell softly to the ground, the two sparks in its eye sockets slowly dimmed, and the necromancer\u2019s magic had disappeared, so it returned to being an ordinary skeleton. Robb was just about to ask Lillian to come and dig the skeleton back to its grave; then, he suddenly remembered that the little girl was a little afraid of skeletons. Wouldn't it be scary to move such a creepy skeleton?Alas, I'll do it.He thought while working; his magic crept into the skeleton.The skeleton immediately began to move, and two more sparks lit up in its eyes, but this time it was manipulated by Robb, not by the necromancer.It first took back its broken left arm and shook its hands and feet, ensuring there were no missing arms and legs. Then, it grinned wide and clicked twice. Then it tried making a face at Lillian nearby, which was meaningless because it had no facial muscles. In Lillian's eyes, the skeleton just shook its head at her, creaking back into its grave. It laid down, folded its hands on its chest, and the spark in its eyes slowly dimmed again.Robb ended the \u201cSkeleton Control\u201d spell and smiled, then said to the dumbfounded Lillian, \"Bury this, too!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 18": "Chapter 18: This is a huge conspiracyLillian's heart was surprised that her owner could also manipulate skeletons. This was really strange! Wasn't master a priest? The messenger of the brilliant and holy God of Light. Why can he use this kind of sinister and evil magic used to manipulate skeletons?However, her facial expressions are so amazing that her thoughts, which should obviously be kept in her heart, were all exposed on her face.Robb winked at her and smiled, \u201cI am the messenger of the God of Light. I only used the holy light on the skeletons, and they obeyed God\u2019s will and went back into their graves. This is not some sinister and evil magic.\u201d\u201cAh? So that\u2019s it.\u201d A smile immediately formed on Lillian\u2019s face. \u201cI knew my master was a good man.\u201d\u201cAlright! Bury it quickly.\u201d\u201cYes, master.\u201d Lillian plucked the earth with the shovel in her hand and buried all the graves. Robb took advantage of this opportunity to look around several areas of the cemetery, and as he expected, strange magic runes were plotted in the four corners of the cemetery.To be honest, Robb doesn't recognize these runes. He only knew that they were used for manipulating skeletons from a distance. Although he knows the magic to control the undead, he can only use them and isn't good at identifying them.Because, in the game, when using magic, sparks of light flash on the screen, and then all kinds of other beautiful effects fly around the screen before a huge magic array is shown on the ground. Most players won\u2019t study how a magic array is made or plotted. The more complex the magic array, the less likely players will look at the small symbols on it.Anyway, even if Robb doesn\u2019t wear equipment or is stark naked, most magic wouldn\u2019t be able to break his basic defenses. It would be na\u00efve to think you can draw a magic array right before him. He could stand in the middle of a clash of monsters on top of the pile of monster corpses and watch the other monsters fight for half an hour. Only then could he have had a mouthful of his own milky satisfaction.He used four dispels on the four runes plotted on the four corners of the cemetery. Watching the runes slowly disappear, he clapped his hands and said, \u201cLillian, are you done?\u201d\u201cDone burying, master!\u201d\u201cGreat, let\u2019s go back and take a rest.\u201d\"Huh? Master! Just returning like that? Don't we need to keep watch?\" Lillian then said, \"What if the bad guy who tried to steal the bones returns? You seem to have spoiled his plans. I'm afraid he'll get angry and come to your door look for trouble.\u201d\"Look for trouble?\" Robb used detection again with a range of 5000 yards, shook his head, and said, \"He's far from us now. He wouldn't come. If he does come, it'll be a good thing. I'll just hang him from the ceiling fan and whip him\u2026. Right, the ceiling fan has to be set to fifth gear!\"Lillian looked confused, \u201cWhat\u2019s a ceiling fan?\u201dRobb used his hands to gesture the rough appearance of a ceiling fan and said, \"It's an instrument of torture, usually hanging from the ceiling. The villain is made to hang on it. When all five gears are turned on, the villain will keep spinning; then we'll beat him up with a whip. You can evenly hit every piece of meat in his body's front and back parts.\"Lillian stuck out her tongue, \u201cI don\u2019t understand, but it seems amazing.\u201dRobb smiled, \"Alright, let's go back to bed. We'll have to tell the townspeople what happened here tomorrow, especially the part where dozens of skeletons had already been stolen before I came. This must be made clear to them. It's not my pot. I'm not carrying it.\"The two of them returned to their rooms. Robb didn't sleep well at the mayor's house last night because of Gorda\u2019s loud snoring. So tonight, he was sleepy and fell asleep as soon as he got into his room.Lillian didn\u2019t sleep as well as Robb did. She went into the servant\u2019s room and got into the warm quilt, with her little head sticking out of it. She looked at the newly bought furniture in the room and couldn\u2019t help but feel happy; her new life had started, and it felt great!The second day!Early in the morning, Lillian went to inform the mayor of what happened last night, and he hurriedly issued a notice to everyone in the town.When they heard that some bones had been stolen from the cemetery, the townspeople were all startled. This matter was deeply related to the interest of the entire town, so it was necessary to witness it for themselves. So, all the hundreds of families in Westwind town came, and soon, the cemetery was full of people.At this moment, Robb and the mayor were standing in front of dozens of empty graves; beside them were dozens of townspeople, looking sadly at the scene in front of them.\u201cThe bones of my father\u2026 Sure enough, it was stolen\u2026 wowa\u2026 Who is this deranged?\u201d A middle-aged woman knelt on the ground and cried.\"My mother's bones are gone, too! Damn it. If I find the thief, I'll cut his head off.\" A blacksmith with an axe roared angrily.The mayor turned his head and shouted angrily, \u201cShut up, can\u2019t you see I\u2019m talking to the priest? How can we talk about it if all of you are so noisy?\u201dFearing the mayor\u2019s authority, the dozens of families and to turn down the volume of their sobs.The mayor then turned around and saluted Robb, \"Father, thank you for checking last night and saving three graves; otherwise, three more families would've knelt there and cried.\"\u201cWell! Robb then said, \u201cIt was just a little effort.\u201dOf course, it was an easy thing to do for him, but it provided great kindness to the townspeople whose relatives' graves were preserved. While they were constantly thanking the God of Light and their \"Father,\" Robb.Robb was distraught that they thanked the God of Light first. Fuck, what relation does the God of Light have with this? It is obviously all my credit. It has nothing to do with the God of Light\"Father! Look, what do you think about this?\" The mayor said, \"Should I organize some townspeople to go into the mountains to look for that damned skeleton thief, or should I pay to hire adventurers\u2026.\"As soon as Robb heard the last syllable, he understood that hiring adventurers was just a justification; his real intention was to let Robb take on all the troublesome things!Nonsense. Your great father here isn\u2019t going to do such a troublesome thing. I\u2019m tired of doing similar things in the game, okay? What\u2019s the difference between this and the game\u2019s \u201cInvestigate so-and-so and defeat the man behind him?\u201d It\u2019s not anything new! I am not playing that type of game again.Robb put on a serious face and was ready to 'fool' someone else to deal with it. Anyway, he said solemnly and seriously, \"My child, you seem to think this is simple. Did you think that the man behind this is a lowly thief? Did you think that this is something that can be solved by a group of townspeople or a party of adventurers? Na\u00efve! The God of Light has given me an oracle. This is a huge conspiracy; soon, darkness will cover this land!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 19": "Chapter 19: Ask the lordRobb's words word said solemnly and seriously; with that one sentence, the mayor almost knelt, and the townspeople opened their mouths wide and looked visibly confused.The mayor asked, \u201cWhat huge conspiracy? Wha\u2026 what\u2026 what conspiracy?\u201d\u201cLook at the dozens of empty graves here,\u201d Robb continued, \u201cIt shows that dozens of skeletons have been stolen days before I settled in Westwind town.\u201d\"Yes!\" The mayor nodded and said, \"Of course, we can see that.\"Robb said, \"I also told you last night my opponent was a necromancer. If you think about it, a necromancer has been stealing dozens of skeletons for several days, so what are they now?\"The mayor was startled. \"Do you mean they have all been refined into undead skeleton soldiers?\"\"Yes!\" Robb said, \"It is clear that after so many days, the necromancer has injected necromancy magic into their bodies. They are no longer dead bones but undead. Moreover, he isn't satisfied yet; he is still stealing skeletons. If I hadn't come last night, at least dozens more skeletons would have risen from the ground and walked toward the necromancer. Are you sure he only has the dozens of skeletons he stole from here? Maybe he's got hundreds, thousands of skeletons gathered elsewhere.\"The mayor began to consider the importance of this seriously. After a few seconds, he understood something, and his expression suddenly changed, \"Oh, why is this necromancer training so many skeletons? Could it be\u2026 don't tell me\u2026\"Robb nodded, \"You guessed right. This necromancer is involved in a huge conspiracy. He is forming an army of undead. This army only has one purpose: to cover a town in blood! Occupy a territory! Maybe he is even preparing to topple the magic kingdom Gran, overthrow Norma, the kingdom of knights, or march to the rabbit kingdom of Great Tang. He might try to seize the throne, rule the land under heaven, the whole world, or unify Fengmo Continent\u2026\u201dBluffing, just bluffing! Fearing things wouldn't escalate much, he seized the matter into his own hands and led them to the worst of possibilities. Anyway, he didn't need to invest much energy into talking bullshit; if he wanted to analyze the situation, he'd analyze it however he wanted. If his analysis was incorrect, then he can just say that he really was just a thief and was overthinking it to take the proper precautions before anything happened. Anyway, it is reasonable to say that these are the true colors of a con man.The mayor's mind swayed like a ball of paste as if he had imagined an army of undead wielding knives, and his face went dark, \"My father, you are right! Sure enough, this isn't a problem that can be solved by a group of townspeople or a party of adventurers. This matter must be reported to the lord as soon as possible, and the lord must send troops to deal with the matter.\u201d\"You are very wise.\" Robb patted him on the shoulder and said, \"Go and ask the Lord to deal with it.\"He was secretly cheering, \"Alright, bluffing over! I'm not in charge of this matter, so I'll just let the lord worry about him and let him lead his troops into the Black Pine Mountain Range. Like an idiot searching for something in a carpet, he\u2019s looking for a necromancer whom he didn\u2019t even know the whereabouts of. He's already done this stupid thing many times back in the game, so he won't do it again.So\u2026The mayor hastily wrote a letter to the lord, and the townspeople dispersed one after another, crying. After a while, Lillian, who went to inquire about some news, returned to Robb, \u201cThe mayor wrote a letter and passed it onto a merchant. The merchant then set out with the letter and his caravan toward Bright Road to the southeast. He said he was going to deliver the letter to the Great Duke of Bright Road.\u201dBright Road is an important city on the western border of the magic kingdom \"Gran,\" a military town, so to say. It's managed by the famous great duke of the kingdom, \"Yingsi\", who is a powerful holy knight. All small castles, towns, and villages west of the kingdom are under his jurisdiction.If something happens here in Westwind town, Yingsi must take charge. However, he certainly won't come in person; he'll probably send in a subordinate to lead a small team to investigate the situation first.Of course, it had nothing to do with Robb; even if he doesn\u2019t go, someone else will go in his stead.Peace returned to the town, and Robb could finally return to being lazy.\"Master, I want to learn how to make the dish you cooked yesterday.\" Lillian brought to pieces of meat with a cute expression, \"I can't just make that soup. I'll have to take charge of your diet in the future, so I have to make food that the master likes. Can you give advise me?\"Point at a ghost. I only got the chef skill from the game. I really can't teach you. Robb had to rack his brains to think about it and finally thought of how to make steak, \"First, use a stick to hit the meat, and beat it till it's soft. Then, chop the mushrooms into a paste, and stir it with salt and pepper to make the mushroom sauce. Afterward, heat up the frying pan and put a layer of butter on it. Wait until the butter melts and fry the beef until it\u2019s medium-well, then pour on the mushroom sauce. Mm-hm. That\u2019s about it.\u201d\u201cThis... This complicated?\u201d Lillian was stunned, \u201cYesterday, didn\u2019t master just point at the beef, mushrooms, and salt? Why are there so many steps when I have to do it? There are a lot of new ingredients as well?\u201dRobb was forced to act dumb, \u201cI used magic. Can you do magic?\u201dLillian shook her head pitifully, \u201cNo!\u201dRobb said, \u201cIt\u2019s not going to take a lot more steps, honestly.\u201dLillian pitifully went into the kitchen to do some cooking research.Robb sat in the front yard in a daze, lazy. After some time, he found a middle-aged townsman poking his head just outside the yard, as if he wanted to come in but was too afraid to.Robb shouted at the top of his lungs, \u201cThief! (TL: I\u2019m not sure about this word \u5454) little hiding thief\u2026 sigh\u2026 who are you? What are you doing walking around my house?\u201dThe townsman was startled when Robb shouted, but now that Robb had seen him, he had no choice but to walk up to Robb with his head drooping, \"My father, I've come to confess. But I was a little scared, so I wandered outside.\"\u201cOh? Confession? Robb immediately realized this was where he'd sit in a cabin while listening to the people confess outside. The thing he had never played in the game, he's beyond interested. He really wants to play!He hurriedly stopped being lazy and jumped up from the stone stool with a swoosh, \u201cGood! Don\u2019t be afraid! Only by confessing your sins to God can you take a big step forward. Let\u2019s start right away.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 20": "Chapter 20: Why don\u2019t you want to play with me?Robb sat in a small cabin. Of course, this worn-out house had a scientific name, \"Confession Room.\" He sat inside while the townsman sat outside, posing for a confession.Confessions are a very sacred thing for followers of Light. The usual process is that believers would confess their sins to the priest and repent their sins. While the priest will comfort him, saying that his sins can be forgiven. Only then will the confessor's heart be liberated and face the rest of his life with a smile.The townsman whispered across the cabin, \"My father, I\u2026 I have sinned laziness. I have often been too lazy to work recently.\"\u201cWhat? Lazy?\u201d Robb immediately followed up on his words and said, \u201cMy child, your behavior is understandable! Lazy for a while, lazy forever! Only laziness is the road for human beings to attain true happiness. As for diligence, it is useless. You\u2019ll encounter difficulties, and you\u2019ll only encounter difficulties forever. When you achieve everything through hard work, you\u2019ll find that you actually feel empty inside, and that feeling of losing a goal is terrible. I tell you, you can be a man of anything, just don\u2019t work too hard. If you work too hard, you\u2019ll have done everything. If you lack anything to do after having done everything, you won\u2019t be able to live as well as a dog. Be lazy! Be lazy as much as you want! When you start being lazy, you\u2019ll realize that the world is full of flowers.\u201dTownspeople: \"\u2026\"Robb said: \"Ah, I accidentally said too much. Continue confessing.\"Townspeople: \"Goodbye! Excuse me! \"\"Hey, don't go; keep confessing, I haven't played enough!\"The townsman left unusually firmly because he felt that he had lost his mind for an instant and felt that he had become an idiot. He left quickly for fear that he\u2019d abandon his life and future. The moment he walked out of the church, he silently made up his mind, I would work hard, I would struggle, and must not become the kind of lazy person said by \"My Father.\"\"Ah? Wait!\" The townsman suddenly understood: \"My father was deliberately being sarcastic. He\u2019s making it sound like he is saying that laziness has many benefits, but he didn\u2019t say any real benefits. It's useless for the world to be full of flowers; he won\u2019t get anything. He was trying to warn me that laziness is useless, and you\u2019ll be left with nothing. Moreover, he wanted to say that you can get everything through diligence! You can lose your goals because you\u2019re too rich. I also want to be so rich that I lose my goals. This truth was deliberately hidden in his words, but I almost missed it.\"\"Wise father, your child will always remember your teachings.\" The townsman bowed lowly at Robb and went away. He felt encouraged and full of energy.Robb crouched on the ground in the corner of the cabin and drew a circle with his fingers: \"Don't go! Come back and play confession with me.\"\"Master! The steak I tried making was a success.\" Lillian ran out happily with two plates. When she saw Robb squatting on the ground, drawing circles, she was startled, \"Master, what's the matter? Do you have a stomachache?\"\u201cNo! I\u2019m fine.\u201d Robb quickly regained his dignity, got up, and patted off the dust on him. Then, he sat down and said, \u201cHey, Lillian, come, let me try the steak you made.\u201dLillian happily placed a plate of steak in front of Robb, arranged his knife and fork, and wrapped a napkin around Robb\u2019s neck. Her little hand gently pulled the corner of the napkin at the back of Robb's neck, which tickled Robb's heart.\"Well, let me see how good your steak is.\" Robb picked up his knife and fork and looked intently at it. The steak on the plate looked good and delicious.At that moment, a young woman came to the front of the chapel. She looked very ordinary, far worse than Lillian, but in this small border town, she was somewhat pretty: \"My father, I \u2026 I'm here to confess.\u201d\"Oh? Come. \" Robb was overjoyed. He hastened to pick up his plate, quickly ran into the cabin, and sat down. Ah, eating steak while listening to a confession. Today truly makes me as happy as a fairy.The woman sat down outside the cabin!Across the cabin, no one could see each other. She had no idea that the priest was cutting steak with a fork in his left hand and a knife in his right in the cabin.The woman said carefully, \"My father, I have committed a very serious crime. I\u2026 I cheated. No, I betrayed my husband and spent the night with a handsome young man.\"\u201cPfft!\u201dAs soon as Robert stuffed the steak into his mouth, he felt an indescribable taste of terror spreading everywhere in his mouth. My god, what is this feeling? This instant destroys all his tasting nerves and paralyzes all the taste buds in his mouth. Aah! Aah! Lillian! Are you trying to poison your Master?Plop, he hurriedly spits it out!The woman outside's heart tightened. Oh no, Father seemed to have thrown up as soon as I said I was having an affair. This \u2026. Is this an expression of his anger?The woman hurriedly said, \"My father, I regret it now. I want to repent. Is there any way to make up for the sins I have committed?\"With a swoosh, a plate of steak was handed out from the cabin, and Robb said in a bitter tone, \"Do me a favor and help me eat it. Don't let my little maid see it.\"The woman took the plate with a bewildered face and saw that the dish made of such a good piece of beef that seemed to be very high quality. Isn\u2019t this the thing that\u2019s often eaten by nobles, called steak? What is \u201cFather\u201d trying to do by giving me this food? I don't understand what \"Father\" is doing at all; whatever, I\u2019ll take a bite first.She cut off a piece of the beef with her trembling hands and put it in her mouth.\"Boom!\"Here brain exploded!The woman burst into tears in an instant, saying, \"Goodbye! Excuse me.\"Robb hurriedly said, \"Hey, don't go. Eat and confess; I haven't had enough!\"The woman left, walking unusually firm; she was afraid that she would be poisoned if she stayed there. It was not until she walked out of the chapel and stood in the streets that she suddenly realized, \"My father, I understand now! Like this piece of beef, my affair looks beautiful and noble, but it is poison. It will destroy me and kill me. You deliberately spit out a few mouthfuls. It was to teach me to spit it out quickly and to not be confused by it just because it looks beautiful! In other words, I shouldn\u2019t indulge in the temptation of infidelity. I need to correct my sins, not to go deeper and deeper. I understand everything you\u2019re trying to say.\"The woman stood up and bowed deeply in the direction of the chapel, \"My father, I will remember your teachings and be a good wife and mother, and will never do anything wrong for my conscience again.\"Robb rolled all over the church floor, \u201cAHH, why? There is no one who wants to play confession with me! I'm the only one who hasn't had enough of this. Why don\u2019t you want to play with me?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 21": "Chapter 21: Help Lillian lighten her loadAfter three days, Lillian\u2019s steak was barely good enough to eat, at the cost of wasting more than a dozen pieces of beef, mushrooms, salt, and half a bottle of pepper that was more expensive than gold. For children who grew up in low-income families, wasting food is shameful and unforgivable, making Lillian feel very uneasy.However, this loss is not a problem for Robb, who has nearly a hundred gold coins in his arms. He\u2019ll be thankful as long as she stops poisoning her Master.Now a new problem is beginning to haunt Robb, and that is-- getting tired of confessions!The confession was a little fun at first, but after three days in a row, Robb has basically heard the same thing. The blacksmith in the east of the town stole the chicken of the farmer in the west, and the farmer in the west of the town slept with the wife of the herbalist in the south of the town. The herbalist's wife in the south of the town stole things from the miners in the north of the town, and then the miners in the north of the town slept with the blacksmith's wife in the east of the town.\"Ah! No one has come to confess. I can return to a state of laziness again.\" Robb turned over on the stone stool in the yard and lay on his side while looking at Lillian near him.Lillian was not idle. She was developing the barren field in the yard with a hoe. Dressed in a maid costume, it was very inconvenient to dig the dirt up, but she insisted on wearing the clothes given to her by her Master instead of her tube clothes. The small hoe dug up the soil and the field up one after another.Robb asked loudly, \"Lillian, what are you going to plant?\"Lillian wiped a handful of sweat from her forehead and smiled, \"Potatoes! We have a field, so of course, we have to use it to grow potatoes.\"Robb said, \"Oh, you can plant it, but it's unnecessary! Just abandon this piece of broken land. Why not just buy potatoes? \"Lillian shook her head, \"The strong gusts of wind didn't earn Master's money. I wasted a lot of money on steak the other day. I want to grow potatoes and help Master earn money back.\"Rob thought to himself, \u201cMy money and it being earned from the strong gusts of wind aren\u2019t that far off. Forget it; the little girl is probably just restless. Not everyone can stay lazy on a stone stool like me for an entire day.Lillian, who had been digging in the yard for a long time and sweating, looked back and saw that the cup on Robb's table was empty. She put down her hoe, sprinted to the well, laboriously fetched a large bucket of water, and went into the kitchen to boil it.Seeing her busy and hard-working for a bucket of water, Robb suddenly felt a little worried. She did all the things at home by herself. How tiring is it? No, I had to think of something to help her reduce the pressure of her work.The easiest way, of course, is to buy a few more maids, but Westwind town is too small, so there aren\u2019t many merchants, and most of the limited number of merchants are small local traders who are not real merchants. They only sell daily necessities such as cloth, salt, weapons, and farm tools. They do not sell high-end things such as slaves.And the only big merchant who has the ability to travel north and south, that is, the smart guy who sold Lillian to Robb, has now gone to the bright road with a letter from the mayor, and then he has to go to the capital of the saints to sell the flying dragon leather armor that Robb gave him. Next, he will probably have to go to many places to restock and so on. He will have to take a big turn on the map before returning to Westwind town.The old merchant has been out for months, and he\u2019ll probably have to wait a long time to buy a maid from him.Robb regrets that he didn't buy a few more maids then. Now, he can't buy it even if he wants to.I can't let my little maid get too tired, but I'm not willing to let myself help. If I really helped Lillian do this and that, it would seem that I was very gentle, but wouldn't the lazy life of the happy feudal landlord be completely ruined?While thinking about this, Lillian came out of the kitchen, went to the well to fetch a large bucket of water, and then diligently carried the bucket to the kitchen.Robb decided that first of all. He had to help Lillian solve the problem of drawing water since Robb is from the modern times and is much cleaner than people from the medieval age. What Lillian does most of the day now is to fetch water, get up in the morning to boil water and wash Robb's face and mouth, then boil water to make tea for Robb several times a day, and bring a large bucket of water to Robb in the evening. In addition, Robb had to wash his hands before and after meals, and he was very particular about the hygiene of cutlery and cups. Lillian was asked to wash her clothes with water before using them, and her clothes were changed frequently, which consumed several times more water than ordinary people.After the broken land was reinvigorated, she began to grow potatoes. Now, she often had to draw water to irrigate the fields.It is no exaggeration to say that drawing water is Lillian's heaviest task at this stage. If the problem of drawing water is solved, Lillian can relax by more than half of her current relaxation time.Robb made a ridiculous decision with a pat on his forehead: \"Let's just make a tap water system. With tap water, Lillian won't be so tired.\"He raised his voice and shouted, \"Lillian, stop what you're doing after you boil the water and go to town. Find me a Mason and a blacksmith.\"As soon as he finished saying that, Lillian heard a woman outside the chapel courtyard cry, \" My father, please save my husband. He just fell off a cliff and broke a leg.\"\"Oh?\" Robb turned to the courtyard door and saw a fat middle-aged woman in a burlap standing with a middle-aged man on her back. The man's face was gray, with many holes in his burlap. One of his legs was strangely bent and was dripping with blood.Well, with a glance, I can already see what\u2019s happening.There used to be no priest in this town, so when the villagers were injured, they could only use a bag of medicine to treat the injury. Not only did this treat the injuries slowly, but the patient would also have to bear the pain for a long time and eventually might be disabled for life.But now that there is a priest in the town, things are different. A priest can cure the wound with holy magic quickly and safely and will not have to let the patient suffer for a long time or leave side effects, so of course, it\u2019s better if he should come to see the priest.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22: I will teach you divine craftsmanship.Robb's eyes glanced over the middle-aged man's broken leg and said, \"It's badly hurt.\"The middle-aged woman hurriedly said, \"We, husband and wife are both loyal followers of Light. Please show benevolence and save my husband.\"Whether you believe in the religion of Light or not is none of my business! Robb thought so, but he didn't say that. There's no need to make trouble for himself. It's fun to play a cameo as a priest.He put on a bright and holy expression and said, \"Oh! My children, I am deeply saddened that you have suffered so much. May God bless you.\"When he was about to throw out a cure, he suddenly remembered that Xuelu had said that he did not need chants to cast magic and suspected that he had an artifact that could shorten the chanting time of the spell. This is not a good misunderstanding. Others may think that he has something valuable on him. What if some thieves plot against him?Robb is not afraid but doesn't like to make trouble for himself. If he lives in an environment with the threat of \"Assassination\" every day, he can't be lazy.Let's just pretend to chant.He didn't know how to say the authentic chants of this world, so he tried to copy the chant of Xielu and read it blindly, \u201cGod of Light..\" Saying it till that point, he realized that he didn't know anything about the God of Light. The God of Light has been written and explained in the game's background story, but he didn\u2019t read the background story carefully.Damn it! Forget it; whenever the God of Light showed up, he just skipped it and deliberately lowered the volume. He murmured a few syllables that you can't hear clearly. He\u2019ll just say the name of the God of Light and then say, \"Please listen to my request. Lend me the divine power temporarily... Fly, Heal! \"Seeing the priest saying the chant seriously, the middle-aged woman hurriedly laid her husband flat on the ground, then quickly knelt down, put her hands on her chest, and prayed piously. A golden light wrapped the middle-aged man's body, his twisted leg instantly restored to its original condition, and his gray face regained its healthy complexion, and then the middle-aged man jumped with a woosh.Probably thinking he was being rude, the man jumped and immediately knelt down: \"Thank you, God of Light. Thank you, Father.\"\"Well. All right! Get up.\" Robb began to get upset again, always putting the God of Light before me. Well, forget it, I\u2019m an adult, and I won\u2019t complain about such trifles.The middle-aged man stood up and respectfully handed over some silver coins with both his hands, \u201cMy father, I want to donate this money to the chapel.\"Robb knew that it was payment for the treatment, not a donation to the chapel, just to put it mildly. But a few silver coins is just too small a sum for him to take. He smiled and said, \"You don't have to donate money. I want you to do something for the church, is it alright?\"Of course, the couple did not dare say no, and nodded quickly, \"It is an honor for us to contribute to the messenger of Light.\"Robb said, \"Just go to town and bring me a Mason and a blacksmith.\"The couple looked at each other and took a while to realize that the priest was taking pity on the poor, so he was unwilling to take their money and changed the price to help him find someone\u2014what a benevolent man he truly was.Praise the God of Light, praise his benevolence, and praise the world.The middle-aged man said respectfully, \"Father, you don\u2019t need to look for a blacksmith. I am a blacksmith! I'll stay here and listen to you. My wife will find a Mason for you.\"The middle-aged woman respectfully saluted Robb, then spread her feet and ran to the town mason, the bricklayer, while the blacksmith stayed and sat down, ready to listen to Robb.Robb smiled and said, \"I didn't expect that you\u2019re a blacksmith. That's good! Are you good at forging ironware?\"The blacksmith nodded and said, \"Yes, my blacksmithing is good. No matter how complicated the object is, I can make it perfectly.\"A smile formed on Robb's face. \"Now, I'm going to teach you some very useful knowledge, Divine Craftsmanship. Would you like to learn it?\"In fact, Western priests are often knowledge disseminators, and they will spread all kinds of technology and knowledge to all parts of the world to recruit believers. Therefore, it is widespread for priests to impart knowledge to the people. Robb's words did not arouse the middle-aged man's suspicion but made him very happy, \"I do! My father, you not only helped me treat my injuries but will also teach me knowledge, you \u2026... You are really the messenger of God. \"\"Well said.\" Robb smiled and then said, \"First of all, can you make iron pipes?\" With his hand, he gesticulated a thin pipe that looked like a water pipe.The blacksmith immediately said, \"I'm sorry. I can\u2019t!\"Robb: \"Didn't you just say that your skills are good?\"The blacksmith said awkwardly, \"An iron pipe is a very advanced craft, which is usually used to make fireworks. This is not something a country blacksmith like me can do. It\u2019s usually a divine craft mastered by the army blacksmiths of Wang du.\" (TL: Wang Du was a warlord during the early Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period of China)\u201cDivine craft.. don't describe a mere iron pipe as a divine craft.\" Robb then said, \"Now listen to me. First, dissolve the iron, then wrap the dissolved iron on a steel bar. Afterward, beat it evenly, and when it solidifies a little bit, remove the steel bar. Then, you have a formed iron pipe.\"The blacksmith looked confused. \"Watt? It\u2019s that simple?\" He thought carefully for a few seconds, and then he was overjoyed, \"Thank you, my father. Thank you so much. I can now be as good as an army blacksmith.\"Robb said, \"I'll ask you my next question, can you make a faucet?\"\"What is a faucet?\"Robb had no choice but to use a branch to draw a faucet on the ground to tell the blacksmith how to get the valve inside. This thing is a little difficult for this kind of country blacksmith. After explaining it for a long time, the blacksmith finally understood. However, Robb does not know whether this guy can forge it successfully. It is estimated that even if he is successful, it will not be precise enough. There will be a slight water leakage, but it does not matter. If it leaks, I\u2019ll just take a basin and put it under the faucet.\"This is a little complicated, but if I think about it carefully, I'll be able to create it for father.\" The blacksmith respectfully continued, \"Give me two days. No, three days. It should be done by then.\"\"Then good, you\u2019ll be able to finish it quickly. You\u2019ll need to forge a few more iron pipes and connect them together. It\u2019ll be long, very long.\" Robb pointed to the chapel's roof and said, \"Together, there will at least one iron pipe that extends from the roof to the kitchen, one from the roof to the yard, and right, one from the roof to the toilet. Yeah! Just consider these three positions for the time being. It requires a lot of iron. I'm afraid you don't have enough money so here's some money. You can buy iron with it.\"Robb not only didn't accept the payment for his treatment but instead gave him a handful of silver coins.The blacksmith was so flattered that he could swear that Mr. Robb was the kindest, most honest, and most benevolent man he had ever witnessed in his life. He was the true messenger of God, with all the perfect qualities.He knelt, worshipped, and praised Robb with all the compliments he knew and left.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 23": "Chapter 23: Archimedes, do you know?The Mason soon arrived. The town wasn\u2019t big, so it took only a few minutes for the middle-aged woman to find the Mason. Just like the blacksmith just now, he was also a simple and honest middle-aged man. As soon as he saw Robb, he quickly looked respectfully, \"My father. I heard that you're looking for a Mason. I'm happy to help you.\"Robb did not beat around the bush and said directly, \"I need you to cut off the chapel roof and build a reservoir of water on it.\"\"Huh?\" The Mason was startled, \"Father, this can't be done. Building a reservoir on the roof is too heavy. The chapel will collapse easily and will easily leak like it\u2019s raining.\"Robb carefully thought about it. He\u2019s right. The building standards of here still haven't reached the level of building water reservoirs on the roofs of houses and chapels.\"I'll tell you what. Build a small stone tower on the clearing next to the chapel, which is next to the well, and then build a reservoir on top of that tower,\" Robb said.\"I can do this.\" The Mason quickly saluted: \"But it takes a little more strength, and a lot of stones need to be moved. I don't have enough strength alone.\"Manpower's quite troublesome for ordinary people to get, but for the rich, it is simple. Robb suddenly thought, \u201cI used to take tasks in the game and was commanded by NPCs. Now it\u2019s my turn to take command.\u201dOkay, time to release a building mission.He took out two gold coins, smiled, and said, \"Okay, now I'll give you a mission, that is, to help me build a small stone tower as high as the roof, and build a big reservoir on it. These two gold coins are the reward. Think of a way yourself to hire people. I don\u2019t have to care.\"The Mason was overjoyed. The manpower of this broken town was valued at two gold coins. He could invite many people to line up and carry stones with less than a dozen silver coins. Deducting the cost of materials, he'll earn at least one gold coin upon completion of this mission.He said happily, \u201cMy father, please leave t to me.\u201dThe Mason used all the commendatory words he knew to praise Robb and left happily.Three days later!Beside the well, a wide and thick stone tower was erected. Since the top of the tower is to be built with a reservoir, the stone tower cannot be built very small and must be built with a big arm and waist. The bottom is solid with stone, and the middle is not hollow like an ordinary \"Tower\" at all. It was filled with stone. It is not so much a stone tower as a stone mountain.The stone mountain was built by twenty townspeople, who kept carrying stones from the rocky slopes on the hillside, built under the command of the Mason for three days, and the cracks between the stones were glued with a strange kind of mud. Each of them was paid only three silver coins, and in this manner, they were alreadypleased.The Mason pasted layer after layer of waterproof material in the top-most part of the reservoir. To be honest, Robb didn't understand how people prevented water leaks in this era. He couldn't figure out this strange material, but it didn't matter. Anyway, it's good to be able to store water in the end.\"Father!\" The Mason courteously said to Robb, \u201cNow it's ready; after it dries, you can store water in it. If it rains before it dries, I'll get here immediately and cover it with a tarp.\"Robb said, \"Good, these two gold coins are yours.\"The Mason took the money and said, \"Thank you, God of Light, and thank you, Father.\"Thanking God again? Fine, if you're not benevolent, I'm not righteous.Robb assumed a magnificent look: \"Oh, my child, the God of Light will remember your dedication to the chapel.\"This is called treating him in his own way. Since you like to thank the God of Light so much, I will let the God of Light remember your dedication. As for me, of course, I will not remember. I want to be a feudal landlord with no feelings. Hum!After collecting the money, the Mason looked curiously at the stone tower towering by the well, \"Father, what on earth are you doing? Although I made this thing for you, I don't think it is practical. Why should the reservoir be built so high? How can water storage be used like this? Do you have to build a ladder to climb every time you have to use water?\"Robb smiled and said, \"well, don't worry yet! The answer will show up soon. \"At this point, the blacksmith came and brought many iron pipes of different lengths and several faucets.As soon as he saw Robb, he saluted respectfully, greeted the God of Light first, and then his father, \"My father, I finished the iron pipes and faucets as you asked, and after I got the techniques you taught me, I quickly made the iron pipe, but the faucet was so difficult that it took a lot of time.\"\"It doesn't matter. Understandably, it'd take some time.\" Robb smiled and said to the Mason, \"Help the blacksmith and put these pipes in the innermost part of the reservoir.\"The blacksmith didn't know what he was doing yet, but as soon as he saw the pipes, he looked up at the reservoir built high above and suddenly understood it. After all, he is a professional who often deals with muddy water, and the reason why water flows downwards is more apparent to him than to anyone else.\"Hey, hey, hey?\" The Mason shouted, \"I seem to understand something. It turns out this is how the reservoir is used? My God!\"The Mason felt as if he had learned something.However, he soon sat down on the ground and growled, \"No! Although it seems more convenient to get water, if it doesn't rain, there will be no water in the reservoir, and it\u2019ll end up being useless. Even if the next rainstorm fills it up, it will run out as long as it doesn't rain for a few days. Although the idea of adding iron pipes to this high reservoir is great, it is actually not very practical.\"Robb patted the Mason on the shoulder and said with a smile, \"Archimedes, do you know?\"\"I know!\" The Mason nodded abruptly and said, \"Archimedes, the most famous specialist of ancient devils, is known to all on this continent.\"Robb said, \"Great devil specialist? Ahem!\"Well, it seems that Archimedes exists in this world, but he is no longer an ordinary mathematician but a devil specialist; forget it, that's not the point! First of all, Robb said, \"Archimedes solved the pumping problem a long time ago. Its name is Archimedes Water Screw.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24:\u00a0 Water ScrewAround 250 B.C. in Europe, Archimedes solved the problem of pumping water. He designed a very powerful water screw. That's why Robb was surprised that Archimedes became a devil specialist in this world and has been dead for many years. Robb estimated that Archimedes' water screws are already being used by many in this vast world, but this remote town doesn't know it yet.For the time being, Robb won\u2019t explain what Archimedes\u2019 water screw is. The Mason should first work with the blacksmith to install all the iron pipes, faucets, and other things. They'll have to connect the iron pipes by burning both ends of the iron pipe on the spot and connecting them. The place where the faucet connects with the iron pipe should also be heated and connected. We can only use this simple and rough way to seal pipes together in this era. Put short, three long pipes were directed down from the reservoir and connected to the chapel toilet, kitchen, and the fields in the yard.Next, we\u2019ll have to wait till the reservoir is dry before we can put it to use.Therefore, at this moment, Robb called the blacksmith, drew a picture of Archimedes' water screw on the ground with a branch, smiled, and said to the blacksmith, \"When you head back, you have to forge this next. This time the iron pipe can be thicker, the iron sheet thinner, and bent into a spiral. This shouldn't be too difficult.\u201d\"Oh, there's nothing wrong with that.\" The blacksmith said, \"I can do it.\"He was so excited to find out that he could learn the techniques equal to a \"Divine Craftsman\" from Robb that his biceps stirred. It reached the point where he couldn't wait to make this bizarre object for him to see.Two days later, the screw pump was complete. Although the blacksmith's skills weren't good and couldn't make it accurate enough with each spiral parallel, it's fine as long as it can pump water; its ugliness is irrelevant.Two days wasn't enough time for the reservoir to dry, so Robb secretly used wind and fire magic at night to dry it up. He did this to match the timing of the blacksmith.Hundreds of townspeople flocked to the chapel that morning, and even the mayor and his wife came to watch. In such a small town, people can easily come and watch whenever the chapel plans to do something. The townspeople all came to watch when they heard that the priest would show off his great skills today.The small courtyard of the yard was full of people, with Robb and Lillian surrounded in the middle.The townspeople pointed at the reservoir above, and people were murmuring in a quiet voice from time to time.Robb doesn\u2019t have to listen to be able to guess what they\u2019re talking about. They\u2019re probably wondering what this thing is for. Now, all that\u2019s required is a demonstration.\"Blacksmith put the screw in the well.\"\"Alright, Father!\" The blacksmith and several townspeople who came to help carry the long Archimedes screw to the well and put one end of the screw into the deep well while the other end was on the edge of the reservoir. The long spiral iron barrel attracted all the townspeople to stretch their necks to watch.Westwind town is a small town with \"mining, agriculture, hunting, and herbalism\" at its core. There are a lot of blacksmiths in this town, with more than a dozen blacksmiths standing in the crowd. They looked at the spiral iron barrel and thought, \u201cI can also build this thing. I just don't know what it is, but if it works, I'll make one.\u201dThe Mason leaned up and stirred the handle of the screw pump himself. Soon the whole screw began to rotate, and the curved spiral pipe kept pumping water out of the well, and soon the first drop of water was pumped into the reservoir.\"Woah! This is something that draws water from a lower surface to a higher surface.\"\u201cWow! This thing is awesome!\u201d\u201cIt is said that it is the invention of Archimedes, an ancient devil specialist.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s amazing!\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t believe we can pump up water like this. Hey, if we put this thing by the river, won\u2019t we be able to pump water to irrigate the farmlands?\u201dYes, that\u2019s amazing. Let\u2019s make one for our family later.\u201dFor these simple townspeople, this kind of craft can genuinely be regarded as a \"Divine Craft.\" They all couldn't help but sigh.As the screw pump kept spinning, the water in the well was pumped up in large quantities, and soon the reservoir was filled with water; and the Mason who was in charge of operating the pump was not tired at all, and rotating the screw was much easier than he had imagined. He couldn't help shouting with ecstasy, \"My father, this thing is great! I can't wait to see your next demonstration.\"\"Well, the reservoir is full, so let's move on to the next stage.\" Robb stood out with a holy smile on his face and stood in front of the faucet by the farmlands. He raised his hand high and said to the townspeople around him, \"My children, next, what you will see is a truly great thing that can improve your life. I call it tap water.\"\"Tap water?\" The townspeople whispered silently.They saw Robb's hand softly twisting the faucet\u2026\u201cClatter!\u201dClearwater gushed out of the faucet.The result was as expected. The Mason wasn't surprised. He was the first person in the town to comprehend the tap water system, but the other villagers looked confused and thought for dozens of seconds. Their eyes extended along with the faucet to the reservoir. They finally realized what they saw.Robb said with a smile, \"When you want to use water at home, just connect the pipe to where you want it to go. At any time, just gently twist the faucet top, and the iron pipes will send the water directly from the reservoir... Twist it in the opposite direction and look. The water stopped flowing.\"After saying this, Robb found that the faucet was still dripping after it was twisted tightly. Ehh, there wasn\u2019t any rubber ring in it after all, so It was impossible for it not to leak. He hooked a wooden basin with his foot and put it under the faucet. And then continued to put on a brilliant and holy expression.\"Wow!\"\"That's amazing.\"\"This\u2026 This is great!\"\"Praise the God of Light, praise our father, praise Archimedes, for giving us such a great craft!\"Robb can't help complaining again. I'm not jealous of you praising Archimedes, but what's with the order of your praises? Putting the God of Light in front and me in the second place, all in front of Archimedes. Doesn\u2019t Archimedes want merits? Hello?? Apologize to Archimedes for me!While everyone was busy doing praises, Robb walked towards his stone stool, sat down, and instantly returned to a state of laziness, \"Alright, I'm done doing the demonstration. You guys do what you have to do, don't throw boos here. I have passed the necessary information to you guys. You guys will just have to figure it out by yourselves.\"The townspeople slowly dispersed. Then, the mayor grabbed the Mason and the blacksmith: \"Hey, don't go, my family is going to install one of these things. Hurry to my house to help make one.\"\"The price...\"\"We'll negotiate over the price\u2026.\"[Robb acquired tap water]\u00a0TL: Hi guys, sorry for the rough translation. I'm sick today, so my mind's kinda muddled rn. Some words were also difficult to convert to English, so I hope you guys aren't too bothered...Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 25": "Chapter 25: The year of the Black Dragon\u2019s FlightThe townspeople dispersed, and the chapel returned to tranquility. Lillian jumped towards the faucet with a woosh, looked left and right, and then, like Robb, gently twisted the faucet.\"Wow!\"A surge of water came out, which startled Lillian. She hurriedly twisted the faucet again and exclaimed, \"Master, this thing is so interesting.\"\"it's not for fun.\" Robb said lazily, \"This will be used to reduce your workload. I'm too tired to see you draw water many times a day, so I made this thing. In the future, when you want to use water, you can gently carry it from here, so you won't have to get it from the well anymore. Oh, by the way, there are faucets in kitchens and toilets, and if you want me to add faucets anywhere else, just let me know, and I'll call the blacksmith to install another one.\"An inexplicable expression arose on Lillian\u2019s face. Her face flushed, and her originally snow-white European face now has a touch of red. It hit him hard. Robb couldn\u2019t help but look stunned. He has never seen something like this in the game.\u201cThank you, master.\u201d Lillian bit her lower lip and said, \u201cI swear I\u2019ll be loyal to master for my entire life.\u201d\"Well, don't make such an oath just yet.\" Robb said, \"You\u2019ll never know. One day, a new life might come for you, so don\u2019t rush to set the tone of your life.\"In fact, he was talking about his feelings about his own life. Who would have thought that he would suddenly be transferred into the game after maxing everything? The ups and downs of life are truly hard to describe.\u201cMaster, master\u2026 the faucet keeps dripping. Should we take care of it first?\u201d Cried Lillian.\"Okay!\" Robb then said, \"Go and fetch me a pen and a white cloth. I'll write a commission and post it in the town center. I'll give a gold coin to anyone who can find me a piece of natural rubber.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it a waste to spend money like this? Should we just look for it in the Black Pine Mountain Range ourselves?\u201d\"I won't go. Even if I have to die, I won't go.\" Robb turned over and over on the stone stool. He then said, \"No way I'm searching a forest like an idiot again. I'm now an NPC who gives out missions, not an adventurer that does missions.\"Time slowly passed with his laziness.And several days passed in a blink of an eye!Robb's faucet no longer leaked. A group of townspeople dived into the woods. After avoiding a small group of goblins, they dug up many medicinal materials and picked up a piece of natural rubber for Robb's commission.And finally, the faucets in Robb\u2019s house won\u2019t leak anymore.Lillian\u2019s job is much easier now. As soon as she twists the faucet cap, the tap water surges out, saving her a lot of time. Only when the water in the reservoir is used up does, she have to take some time and effort to pump water in. However, it is still very different from having to draw water from a well.She had more time to stand beside Robb, sewing silently while Robb was being lazy. One master and one servant, as quiet as a picture.Now, she can not only cook delicious steak but also how to make a maid's costume. She can sew it even without Rob's tailoring mastery and skills.In her spare time, she has made several types of clothing for Robb, all of which were designed in a style that priests often wear. Robb could also sew, but he felt that the clothes he made weren't as pleasant as those made by women, so he ignored the lack of defense and put on the clothes made by Lillian.That afternoon, Lillian sat beside Robb, sewing with her little hands and said, \u201cMaster, the field is ready, and when it comes the right time to sow sweet potatoes, we can plant a whole layer of them.\u201d\u201cOh? Grow sweet potatoes?\u201d Robb remembered that he had never asked what month and year it was currently in this world. Other than the fact that it wasn't cold to wear a T-shirt, jeans, and tube clothes in the cemetery in the middle of the night.\"Ah? How come master doesn\u2019t even know what month and year it is? \" Lillian tilted her head curiously and said, \"This year is 1344 and the year of the Black Dragon\u2019s Flight. On July 20, a month before august, I will be able to plant the sweet potatoes.\u201dRobb said, \"I can understand that the year is 1344, but what do you mean by the year of the Black Dragon\u2019s Flight?\u201dLillian became more and more curious. Why didn't her master know? However, she was only a slave, so she did not question the qualifications of her master and honestly replied, \"Since my childhood, I\u2019ve heard adults say that there is a great mountain range in the middle of the Fengmo Continent, in which there lives a black dragon named Avicus. It\u2019s existed since the prehistoric era, so no one knows exactly how old it is. Usually, it sleeps in the mountains and does not come out to cause trouble, but every four years, it wakes up and flies out of the mountain to look for treasures to take back into its cave. Therefore, every year that\u2019s a multiple of 4, one or two cities will be ransacked by the black dragon, and that year is called the Black Dragon\u2019s Flight.\"\"I see.\" Robb divided the number 1344 by four and came up with an answer, \"In other words, this guy has robbed humans at least 336 times, and yet he hasn't been slaughtered yet?\"\"It\u2019s too powerful.\" Lillian stuck out her little tongue and said, \"There were countless adventurers who wanted to kill it and get the thousands of years of treasure from its cave. However, it can easily kill the greatest warrior in the world. No one could beat Avicus, the black dragon. We can only pray that it does not fly to our city.\"At this moment, she whispered, \"However, I've been through the Black Dragon's Flight three times, but I haven't seen it yet. In a poor town like ours, there isn't even a decent piece of treasure. The black dragon must not have found it appealing. It will never come to Westwind town, more like, \"I may never even get a chance to see it.\"\u201cDon\u2019t plant flags! But maybe if you plant this flag, you\u2019ll be able to eat on the same table with it this year,\u201d Robb said.\u201cHmm? What do you mean by planting flags?\u201d Lillian looked perplexed.\u201cWell, it\u2019s a little hard to explain.\u201dRob was chatting happily with the little maid until he saw a large group of people coming to the chapel door, headed by the mayor, followed by his wife and son, as well as some of the most respectable rich men in town, all with their wives and children.Robb said, \u201cWhat are you doing? Do you want to confess?\u201dThe mayor said, \u201cMy father, we\u2019ve come to invite you to meet Baron Perseus at the town\u2019s gate.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Who\u2019s Baron Perseus?\u201d asked Robb. I don\u2019t know him well, why should I meet him?\u00a0TL: I feel like an idiot ...(*\uffe3\uff10\uffe3)\u30cePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26: A nun is comingThe mayor and the rich townsmen all felt awkward, thinking silently, \u201cMy father doesn\u2019t r even know Baron Perseus.\u201dSeveral seconds later, the mayor said, \"In fact, we don't know him either. We just heard of him. He is a member of the White Lion Cavalry on the western border of Mingzhen, and the Great Duke trusts him a lot. This time, he came to our Westwind town because of you.\"\"Me?\" Robb said, \u201cI don't even know him. Why is he here for me?\"The mayor said, \u201cYes. Just a few days ago, didn't you prevent the three skeletons in the cemetery from being stolen by the necromancer and then expose a huge conspiracy? You asked us to write and ask the Lord to deal with it, so the merchant sent the letter to the Great Duke, who attached great importance to it, and sent his right-hand man, Baron Perseus, to deal with the matter.\"So that's what happened!Robb has teased the little maid and installed a water system these past few days, so he forgot about the necromancer. After all, he\u2019d long been bored of such worldly matters and didn\u2019t bother to take the matter to heart. How could he be worried about it? He just didn't expect that his casual bluff at that time had already touched the concern of the Great Duke.How annoying!Robb tilted his mouth, \u201cNot going, not going. Why should I be the one to meet him? He should come here to meet me instead!\u201dThe mayor was speechless for a moment and thought, \u201cThe priest of light is so famous that he doesn\u2019t have to care about a mere baron.\u201dThe rich men thought, \"Father is usually kind to us, but he's impatient when dealing with the baron. It seems that he's the kind of person who only cares about ordinary people but dislikes associating with nobles. I suddenly feel like Father is too benevolent.\"The mayor hurriedly said, \"My father, it doesn\u2019t matter if you don\u2019t want to greet Baron Perseus, but there is also a nun of Light. You Buy hair Ren, even if Baron Perseus, it doesn't matter if you don't want to greet him, but there is also a nun from the Holy see. You probably have to go and greet her.\"\"Ah? There's a nun?\" Robb cheered up instantly, \"Why didn't you tell me there was a nun? Ahh, I have always cared for my fellow church members, as I am also a devout believer of the God of Light. Of course, I'll meet her. Ahem! In this small town without anything, there's no one who can discuss the teachings of Light with me. My heart has long been turned into a withered desert and urgently needs revitalization with my fellow church members. Ahem! Ahem! Cut the crap, my children, lead the way.\"Mayor and the rich townsmen, \"\u2026.\"Robb turned to Lillian and said, \u201cClean the house. Don\u2019t let the church members see our chapel looking dirty.\u201d\u201cYes, master!\u201d Lillian hurriedly took a broom.Robb wore a brand-new priest's outfit, which Lillian had just sewed for him. It was a good fit. He trimmed his blonde hair and looked at himself through a mirror. There wasn't any dirt on his face. It was nice and a bit too handsome. Now time to go and see little sister nun.Of course, I'm just going to take a look. I have no hidden intentions (serious face).I\u2019ll just have to pray that the nun is a little sister. If it\u2019s an old nun, then... I just hope things won\u2019t come to that\u2026Robb prayed earnestly to the heavens, \"God of Light, I ask of you for your assistance. I hope your nuns are all beautiful women, not the kinds that look like old witches. Because I have accumulated a lot of believers for you, you can't ignore my little demands, right?\"Following the mayor and his party, they soon came to the eastern gate of the town, where there is a road that extends to the southeast, leading to the \"Bright Road\u201d, and then to the \"Capital of Saints.\" Merchants and soldiers often opt for this road, which is the bridge between the towns on the western border and \u2018Wangdu.'After waiting at the town gate for less than ten minutes, the dust rose and flew across the road, and an army appeared in the distance. Robb thought he would see cavalry; after all, they\u2019re called the White Lion Cavalry, but it was actually an infantry unit.Moreover, this army is completely different from the typical knights in heavy armor. They are swordsmen and archers, all in Light armor. Their number isn't large either, just a bit more than a hundred.There were two horses in front. One is a white horse, mounted by a tall and mighty knight in heavy armor that looks very powerful.The other was a red horse. It was shorter and was mounted by a nun. You can see a blue and white-edged nun outfit, which released a graceful aura. It is evident from his position that it is indeed a little sister.\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t come in vain!\u201d Robb was happy, \u201cGod of Light, you truly didn\u2019t fool e, hehe.\u201dThe mayor turned around and said, \u201cMy father, what are you talking about? Your voice was too quiet. I couldn\u2019t hear you clearly.\u201dRobb spread his hand and said, \"I am praying for them. It must have been a very difficult journey. May the God of Light bless them.\"The army finally arrived after a while, and the knight in front dismounted. Although he was dressed in heavy armor, he dismounted smoothly. He looked like a fierce athletic man who could accurately shoot while riding on a horse.This man seemed to be Baron Perseus, a member of the White Lion Cavalry. Robb glanced at him and was disappointed. Unlike in the game, it wasn't possible to tell what the occupation of others is in the real world. His attire looks like he could be a warrior, paladin, or even a priest, because western priests may also wear heavy armor and go to battle with weapons. I even remember throwing a holy counter or something back in the game.Of course, Robb's attention wasn't on the man. He only glanced at the man before turning his attention to the nun.The nun also dismounted, and her blue skirt drew a beautiful arc mid-air. It was beautiful. Robb found that the nun was skilled, unlike the backline type that can only chant magic. Not until she stood on the ground could he see her face clearly. She's a young girl, about twenty years old. She's good-looking with deep facial features. Her expression remained cold and indifferent. She has blonde hair like Robb, but it was mostly covered by her hood, with only a little bit of her bangs showing.The baron and nun came up to Robb and others, and the mayor and the rich townsmen immediately bowed and saluted, \"Welcome, Baron Perseus.\" It seemed that they also wanted to greet the nun, but they didn\u2019t know her name, so they had to say awkwardly, \"Welcome, nun.\"Perseus casually said, \u201cEn.\" After dealing with the mayor and the rich townsmen, he strode up to Robb and said, \"Are you Mr. Robb? I am Baron Perseus of the White Lion Cavalry. It's a pleasure to meet you.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 27": "Chapter 27: Nun from the Church of LightRobb said, \"Oh, hello as well! It's a pleasure to meet you.\"When others are polite, Robb will also be polite.Baron Perseus said solemnly, \"We have received a letter from you saying that there is a necromancer stealing bones here in a vain attempt to form an army of the undead and to do some insane conspiracy. The Great Duke attaches great importance to it.... \"When he said this, Robb was embarrassed. A few days ago, he threw the pot out of laziness, deliberately portrayed the matter exaggeratedly, and asked the mayor not to ask him to help. He did not expect that it would alarm the Great Duke. Isn\u2019t this a little too much?If it was just a thief mage stealing a few skeletons to do something sneaky, the Great Duke would be depressed after his painstaking efforts to find out.I won\u2019t comfort you with sweets even if you cry.Just as he was thinking about this, he saw Baron Perseus make a solemn salute, with one hand on his chest, and his upper body bowed 90 degrees forward, for it was not easy for him to bend down because he was wearing heavy armor. His armor rubbed and rattled.He only heard him earnestly say, \"Thank you for providing such important information. After receiving your notice, the Great Duke sent scouts and cavalry to several nearby villages to investigate. He was surprised to find that most of the towns near the Black Pine Mountains Range had skeletons stolen. Some towns had only a few skeletons stolen, some as many as hundreds, and in towns without priests, the theft was very serious. Counting all the stolen skeletons, more than 700 were stolen.\"Then, he paused to let Robb digest what he had just explained and then went on, \"Before you reported this, no one paid attention to it. The mayors of several towns even thought that wild animals dug up the bones. They didn't even bother tracking them and didn't report it at all. Your announcement made everything clear and made the Great Duke send someone to scout.\"Hearing this, Robb couldn\u2019t help but freeze slightly and thought, \u201cWhat, is there really a huge conspiracy going on? Didn\u2019t I just open my mouth and ramble? It really is undesirable to be able to plant flags at random.\u201dBaron Perseus said with a heavy look, \"You are right to worry. There is an evil necromancer who is forming an army of undead. God knows what it's going to look like. This year happens to be the year of the Black Dragon\u2019s Flight, and the main forces of the royal knights are guarding the Capital of Saints, not knowing when and where it'll attack, and don't dare to relax at all. Our white lion cavalry's main force is also guarding the Bright Road. If the black dragon appears, we will fight it to the death. Young people have more chances to act now that the main army can\u2019t run around anymore. The necromancer must have seen this and took the opportunity to assemble an army of undead to engage in his conspiracy.\"Robb secretly cursed, \u201cErase! Clear! Delete! No, I smell trouble.\u201dThe Baron said, \"The main army couldn't be moved recklessly now, so the great duke said that the lair and movements of the necromancers must be determined before the White Lion Cavalry can be dispatched to defeat his undead army with lightning speed.\"\"Oh, I see,\" Robb said. \"That's really hard work.\"He wanted to change the subject. Otherwise, the Baron might open his mouth to invite him to join the team to look for the necromancer.Though he can refuse and kick everyone away when he\u2019s unhappy, doing so would undoubtedly destroy his lazy life.If he refuses the Church's order or kicks out the people in front of him right now, his fake priesthood will certainly be exposed.The armies of the kingdom of Gran and the Church of Light will come like tidal waves, and I\u2019ll have to beat them back wave after wave. Frick, won\u2019t it just be a tower defense mission then?He\u2019s long since been towered of tower defense!If you don\u2019t want to make trouble for yourself, then I\u2019ll just change the subject.Robb turned to the nun standing next to him, and now, standing closer, he saw more clearly. The nun was tall and shapely. The nun outfit could not hide her graceful posture, coupled with her cold facial features and facial expression. It was pleasing to the eye, and he said, \"Who is this nun?\"The Baron was successfully distracted and hastened to introduce the characters: \"This is Ishir, the nun of the Church of Light! Because this incident involved tracking down a necromancer, and Holy Magic is the nemesis of the necromancer, the Great Duke asked the Church for assistance, and they sent this nun to assist us in our investigation.\"Wow! Robb was overjoyed. So since you already have the help of a nun, you won\u2019t have to pull me in. Safe, safe, I\u2019m safe.However, a new question arose. Since this nun is from the Church of Light, wouldn\u2019t she be able to tell that he\u2019s a fake priest? He\u2019ll first try then.Robb smiled at Ishir, Nice to meet you, my sister.\u201dIshir indifferently, with an icy expression, and emotionlessly replied, \"Hello, my father.\"Robb thought, \u201cGreat, I can be relieved now. It seems like she doesn\u2019t know that I\u2019m a fake priest.\u201dCome to think of it, this is normal. In the medieval era, information and transportation were extremely underdeveloped, and the Holy Light Chapel where this nun was located was only a small branch of the Church of Light. How could she know whether the priests in all the continents' churches were real?Not to mention her, even if the pope comes, he may not know whether he is real or not unless, before he comes here, the pope looks through the \u201cList of Priests\u201d of all the churches on the continent. From Mary to Sunny and Ivory, He still won\u2019t find my name\u2026Ishir said coldly, \"Father, we are here to find the necromancer as soon as possible. Please take us to the cemetery. There may still be clues left by the necromancer.\"\u201cOkay! Come with me.\u201dRobb thought to himself, \u201cAs long as you don't ask me for help, you can toss and play as much as you like.\u201dHe led the way towards the chapel, followed by the Baron and nun, then a large group of soldiers, the mayor, and the rich townsmen of the town were driven away and weren\u2019t allowed to follow at all.By this time, Lillian's already cleaned the chapel; even the yard of the chapel was clean. She was a little afraid when she saw so many people hiding behind a tree and showing half of her face occasionally.Robb was worried that the \"nobles\" around him would attack her. He'd inevitably have to fight against them to protect her if they did. So he waved to her, and Lillian understood and went back to the servants' room and didn't come out.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 28": "Chapter 28: A low-ranked priest who hasn\u2019t completely learned holy magicThe soldiers stopped at the door and divided into two teams. The first team is in charge of guarding the gate, while the second is spread out outside to protect the entire chapel.Robb found that although their army was small, it was well-trained. Baron Perseus didn't speak at all while the captain only pointed fingers. The soldiers found their station by themselves, so it can be said that they didn't lack any training.As soon as Baron Perseus entered the yard, he found a reservoir standing high near the well. It was so high that he couldn't tell there was a water reservoir, but only a large pile of stones built into a platform.He pointed curiously at the reservoir and said, \u201cFather, have you built a beacon in the chapel? If so, why is the beacon so short?\u201d\"It's for water storage; there's a water reservoir on it.\" Robb laughed.What are you doing storing water so high? Baron Perseus couldn\u2019t understand, but he didn\u2019t go about asking him questions. His top priority is still to find out the clues of the necromancer first. There wasn\u2019t any need for anyone to lead the way to the cemetery.Sister Ishir followed behind while Robb moved lazily.The baron crouched in front of an empty tomb and looked inside. He looked at the traces of the dirt at the mouth of the hole, and he looked up, \u201cSure enough, the skeleton crawled out. Even the earth was dug out from the inside.\u201dThe nun also went to the mouth of the hole, and after a few seconds, \"I can still feel the gloomy spirit left by the necromancer.\"The nun was really beautiful. She squatted down and stretched out her hand with an aura of tranquil beauty; coupled with her facial features and cold expression, she seemed like a painting.The baron looked up at Robb and said, \u201cFather, can you elaborate on what you saw that night?\u201d\"Oh, no problem!\" Robb slowly elaborated on what he'd seen that night. Of course, he only said that he used to dispel magic to stop the necromancer; he didn't say that he used 'Control Skeleton' to get the body back into the grave.The baron and nun listened calmly. After a few seconds, the baron looked up and then to the hillside, \"It seems that he may have been on that hillside manipulating the skeletons, and after being dispelled, he withdrew decisively. I should send a team to search that side immediately.\"Robb thought to himself, \"He's not there! I used detection magic at that time, but he wasn't there.Robb wouldn't say this out loud, though, to not cause any trouble.He didn\u2019t say it, but the nun next to him did. She said, \"Baron, I don't think the necromancer was on the hillside.\"Robb thought to himself, \u201cHuh? How did you know? Sister Detective Conan edition? Just a look at the scene, and voila?\u201dThe baron looked back curiously, \u201cSister, can you tell me your reason?\u201dThe nun put on a cold face, \"This necromancer is engaged in a huge conspiracy and has stolen more than seven hundred skeletons. From this point of view, he must be very strong. He's not incompetent; otherwise, his magic wouldn't be able to control an army of undead.\"Robb and the baron agreed, \u201cGood point!\u201dThe nun continued, \"If such a powerful necromancer had been on that hillside, do you think he would have retreated obediently? If a priest in a remote town stops his plot, the priest may even uncover his plot. He'll have to immediately kill the priest then and pretend to be a thief so as to prevent Westwind town from sending that letter to the Great Duke.\"The baron said, \"Oh,\" and realized, \"Yes, that's true.\"Robb thought to himself, \u201cHuh? This nun is very clever! Indeed, the necromancer did not know how strong I was, and if he had been here, he would have rushed out to kill me, but he could not reach out to me from so far away. Knowing that it was too late to stop me from sending the message, he just gave up on the idea. Of course, he was wise to give up; otherwise, he would have hung on the fifth-gear ceiling fan by now.\u201dThe baron immediately had a thought and added, \u201cWhat if the necromancer\u2019s afraid of being restrained by holy magic, so he didn\u2019t dare attack this priest?\u201dThe nun shook her head with a cold face, \u201cAlthough holy magic can restrain the necromancer, it also depends on who is using the holy magic. A powerful necromancer isn\u2019t afraid of a low-ranked priest who hasn\u2019t completely learned holy magic. The so-called restraint can only be said in the case of equal strength.\u201d\u201cOh, I see.\u201d The baron nodded and asked nothing more.However, the conversation between them affixed to Robb\u2019s head the title \u201cA low-ranked priest who hasn\u2019t completely learned holy magic.\"Robb didn't know how to complain, so he just comforted himself, \"Forget it, there are many nuns from the big city. In her eyes, town priests mustn't be strong. I won't argue to maintain my low profile. I'm lazy. Whatever you say, lest you think I'm strong. You'll probably drag me to do this and that for you if you do.\"The baron thought carefully, \u201cAll the villages and towns where the bones were stolen are at the foot of the Black Pine Mountain Range. We are certain that when the necromancer stole the bones, his body was quite far from them. That is to say, \u201cHis lair should be in the depths of the Black Pine Mountain Range.\u201dHe held out his hand and pointed to the mountain in front of him, \u201cIt seems that we have to go into that mountain to look for it. More than a dozen skeletons were stolen not too long ago, so he should\u2019ve left many traces when he entered the mountain. If we follow those traces, we\u2019ll have a good chance of finding the necromancer.The nun nodded, \u201cAlright!\u201dRobb said, \u201cLet\u2019s go! Let\u2019s go!! I\u2019m out of trouble now! It\u2019s just that it\u2019ll be a little regretful to have the beautiful nun leave. There is only a priest and no nuns in the chapel. It feels lacking.While he was thinking about this, the baron said, \"Fortunately, I was prepared. I brought light swordsmen and archers. It'll be no problem for them to search the mountain. It's getting late. We'll station in town for one night and head to the mountain tomorrow morning. My soldiers will camp on the hillside next to the cemetery. I saw a stream over there; you don't have to stay with us old men. Just rest in the chapel for the night.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29: I hate that everyone in this world is dirtyBaron Perseus led the soldiers to the hillside and camped along a brook. His soldiers were skilled. They managed to camp in an instant.However, the cold nun, Ishir, stayed.They stared at each other for an instant.\u201cFather, I\u2019m going to stay for the night.\u201d Ishir was clearly saying her thanks, but her expression was flat, cold, and emotionless.Robb had no reason to refuse such a beautiful nun's request to stay in the chapel for a night, either from a man's or a priest's point of view. He shrugged, \"You're welcome to stay, sister.\"\"That, um, I only live with a single little maid in the chapel, so there are still several vacant rooms. Just take whichever you like.\" Robb said, \"Besides, bedding and other necessities are not available right now... I\u2026\"He was about to say that I would ask the maid to buy them when Ishir took the lead and said, \"I'll take care of it. I'll go around town later and borrow one from one of the believers.\"\"Why borrow from a believer? Just buy it.\" Robb said, \"Borrowing bedding can be scary. If the original owner has skin diseases or anything similar and doesn't even wash it\u2026 Tut-tut, I'd rather buy a new one.\"Ishir replied, \u201cI don\u2019t have money! Nuns don\u2019t need money.\u201dHearing this, Robb suddenly remembered that nuns must make three vows. The first is \"Divine Poverty,\" or, in other words, being poor.Nuns spend their entire lives defending their own poverty and have no personal belongings. Although they are occasionally paid for their work, they won't leave with the money but give it either to an orphanage or a church.Although a little strange, one thing\u2019s certain. That is, they are not materialistic people.Robb loves these types of women. He spread his hands and said, \"If you don't have money, I do. I'll ask Lillian to buy you a set.\"Ishir shook her head thoughtfully and said, \"No need! I'll just stay for a night. I'll borrow a set of bedding. You don't have to be worried about infectious diseases. I know the magic \"Cure Disease,\" which can borrow holy power from the God of Light to cure common diseases. Father, you are also a holy priest. Do you not know \"Cure Disease?\"Robb replied, \"Though I know \"Cure Disease,\" I won't get myself infected deliberately and then use it to cure it. I'm not out of my mind.\u201dHuh? I feel like there\u2019s something wrong with what I just said.Whatever, I'm the host. I'll just make some demands on the guests.He then forcefully said, \u201cI don\u2019t care which quality place you came from. Since you\u2019ve come to my chapel, you\u2019ll have to listen to me. I\u2019ll pay for the bedding. Don\u2019t go outside and borrow some dirty, smelly, and infected bedding. Otherwise, I\u2019ll wrap you up in that smelly bedding and throw you into the cemetery for the night.\u201d\u201cOh! Well, since you insist, I don\u2019t have any problem with that.\u201d Ishir stopped being overly polite and calmy and accepted Robb's offer. In the eyes of nuns, it was only natural for the church to provide food, clothing, and shelter because they devoted their lives to the God of Light.Of course, she didn't know that Robb wasn't from the Church of Light. She would've pictured a huge sacred nova on his face if she did.\u201cThat\u2019s right, sister.\u201d Robb said, \u201cSince I\u2019ll be spending the next half of the day in the yard, can I make a small request?\u201dIshir asked, \u201cWhat requests?\u201d\u201cThink about it. Whenever I call you, I need to say 'My sister'. It's so long and troublesome to say, but if I call you by your name 'Ishir\u2019, it\u2019ll also be quite long. Why don\u2019t I just call you Yi? How is it?\u201d\"No!,\" Ishir coldly said, \u201cPlease use a more formal name.\u201d\u201cAll right, little Yi.\u201d\u201cPlease call me sister.\u201d\u201cI see, little Yi.\u201dIshir, \u201c\u2026\u201dHe was unreasonable. She didn\u2019t know how to talk to such a priest, so she just shook her head and gave up arguing. Call me whatever you want.She went into the chapel to find a vacant room, put down her luggage, and went back to the yard, where she saw Robb telling Lillian, \"Go to town and buy some bedding for the nun. Oh, and while you\u2019re there, buy some towels, water cups, and bowls. The things she'll use must be separated from ours. Err, let's see, maybe something similar will happen in the future. Just buy a few more sets for backup.\"\u201cMy father, I\u2019ll only stay for a night.\u201d Little Yi raised her voice, \u201cThere\u2019s no need for you to waste so much money.\u201d\u201cI know! Even if you only stay for an hour, your drinking cups and eating bowls must still be different from ours. Do you understand now?\u201dLittle Yi, \u201c\u2026\u201dShe's having a hard time understanding Robb's strange penchant for cleanliness. Isn't it odd that he's this fixated on cleanliness? Suddenly, she thought of something, and with an angry look on her cold face, \u201cDo you think I\u2019m dirty?\u201d\"I don't think you're dirty.\" Robb immediately denied it, and as soon as Little Yi's face eased up, he added, \"I hate that everyone in this world is dirty. Oh, no, my little Lillian had learned in recent days and has become quite hygienic. Everyone except her and me is dirty.\"\u201cNonsense.\u201d Little Yi got angry, \u201cI take baths too.\u201d\u201cOnce every?\u201d Robb asked.\"Six\u2026 No, seven days!\" (This world isn't in the middle ages but is a world of swords and magic. There aren't any differences between taking or not taking baths. It's just part of the setting, don't worry about it. Please let history respect my father-in-law's setting. If my father-in-law said that she washes once every seven days, then she washes every seven days! Don't reason with me, history!).Robb immediately showed a look of extreme disgust on his face and screamed, \"Don't\u2026 Don't come closer. Oh, my God, it's hard to imagine how dirty you are. You have such a pretty face, but it's a big trash can and a moving collection of bacteria. If you want to stay in my chapel tonight, you must take a bath, now, now!\"Little Yi almost fainted by his remarks, \"I have washed very hard, all right? Do you take a bath every five days? How dare you use this tone to criticize me!\"Robb told Lillian, \u201cTell this dirty nun the rules of this chapel.\u201dLillian did not dare to talk nonsense to a nun like Robb did. She saluted respectfully, \"Sister, the master's rule is that you must take a bath every day, rinse your mouth three times a day, wash your hands before and after meals, and if you fail to do a good job, he will instantly become lazy\u2026. Ahem. Ahem. Instantly change from a gentle priest to a violent one. Uh. Err, master, I was talking too fast. I'll shush now. I'm not going to call you a lazy or violent priest.\"Robb, \"You already said it!\"\"Wha, master\u2026. I didn't mean to. \"Robb grabbed Lillian and crumpled her little face into several strange shaped.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 30": "Chapter 30: With all due respect, may I askLooking at the master and maid fooling around, even Little Yi lost her anger. Instead, her heart was filled with doubts. What\u2019s the difference between this pair of master and servant? The maid\u2019s a country girl, so she probably doesn\u2019t know the rules, but the master didn\u2019t even make a scene. Is there such a priest in the church of Light? None of the priests I\u2019ve seen were like this.After being toyed around by Robb, Lillian went to town to buy the bedding and daily necessities, and soon, peace was restored to the little chapel.Little Yi and Robb didn\u2019t know each other well, so she couldn\u2019t find anything to say. It was awkward, so she wanted to do something. She saw a bunch of messy footprints on the ground at the yard gate left by the people who came earlier, so she took up a broom and swept the floor.The beautiful nun swept the floor. It was beautiful. The key was her style which Robb appreciated very much.After she finished sweeping, she wanted to clean a table. So, she went into the house to find a bucket and wrapped a rope around it. When she was about to throw it into the well, Robb cried out, \"Wait, err, here, we don't pull water out of the well.\"\u201cHmm?\u201d Little Yi looked at him curiously, \u201cThen, how do you use water?\u201d\"Look at the corner of the field; there's an iron pipe hanging down, see? It's attached to a water reservoir.\"\u201cI see it!\u201d\"Good, go there now, use that faucet. Yes! That thing, rotate it gently and don't put in a lot of strength\u2026.\"As soon as Little Yi twisted it according to his words, the rattling water gushed out of the faucet and startled her, \u201cWhat\u2019s this? Magic?\u201dRobb pointed at the reservoir above in the yard and said with a smile, \"It's called tap water. It's not magic. Put simply. It means to take out water from water stored in high places and use it in lower places.\"Little Yi looked up at the reservoir, then at the faucet. She seemed to understand something. She put the bucket under the faucet and watched the clear water slowly fill up the bucket. She then gently rotated the faucet. The water stopped, then she turned it on again, the water came again, and then it stopped again.After playing with it repeatedly three or four times, her cold expression melted slightly, and she flashed a smile for a moment, but she immediately put it away. She said, \"It's so convenient to use water like this! No wonder you can take a bath every day. If I had this too, I could bathe every day.\u201d\"There are also faucets and toilets in and near the kitchen.\" Robb said thoughtfully, \"Be sure to wash your hands after pooping. I know you like wiping your buttocks with your hands.\"Little Yi, \u201c\u2026\u201dHe didn't have to say that. Little Yi almost went crazy and said with a straight face, \"Father, don't you have any gentlemanly manners?\" Can the word buttocks be used in discussion with a nun?\"\"This is called stating facts.\"\u201cThere are some things you can say and things you can\u2019t!\u201d\"This is not a question of whether it can be said, but a question that must be said. Personal hygiene habits, defend them to your death. There is no room for euphemism, or you'll die off some strange disease sooner or later.\"\u201cHuh?!\u201d Little Yi stopped talking. Robb stopped bothering as well.Robb then spread out his hands, collapsed on a stone stool, and became lazy.After a long time, Lillian returned and brought back the daily necessities, but when she was going to help Little Yi make her bed, she was stopped by her. The hardworking nun decided to make her own bed without needing external help. Robb found something good about her with this small action. This girl doesn't like asking others for help. She likes doing everything herself.From this action, we can see that she isn't born into a wealthy family. I heard that all the nuns are girls from wealthy families, while girls who came from poor families can only be slaves. How did Little Yi become a nun? This is interesting.That night, Lillian's steak seemed to have become repetitive recently, making Robb quite dissatisfied. Westwind town is too small. It is almost impossible to buy any decent ingredients here. I only keep eating steak, lamb, pork, and chicken chops.But Little Yi enjoyed it. For the poor nun, the steak was very high-end.At this time, she'd already bathed and was dressed in clean nun clothes while eating the steak comfortably. Looking around, he saw that the nun clothes she'd changed were hanging on a rope, floating by the wind. It was beautiful.Although her face was cold, she thought to herself, \u201cWhy does it feel much more comfortable living here than in the main Church of Light? This relaxing feeling. Ah... stop... I should stop thinking like this. I almost committed one of the sins, laziness.She tilted her head and looked at Robb strangely when she thought of this.Robb shrugged, \u201cWhy are you looking at me like that? Do I have mushroom sauce on my face?\u201dLittle Yi said, \"Little Yi said, \u201cI don\u2019t seem to have seen you study the \u201cBible of Light\u201d?Robb really wanted to say the line, \"Looking at that worthless holy scripture would no be of no use!\" but he knows that if he says that, he'll probably have to eat \"Divine Punishment\" or \"Mind Shock.\" This little nun will definitely shoot all the attack magic she knows at my face in an instant. His magic resistance is high though, so she'll probably deal little to no damage. Then he'll have to play that tower defense type game again.The Templar knights will probably come to clean up, and after being blown up themselves, the church will ask for troops from the Kingdom of Gran. The Great Duke will then have to send troops to the Bright Road and, along with the White Lion Cavalry, will attack him and be blown up as well. Afterward, the royal knights will come and be blown up, and maybe the Kingdom of Gran will join with Norma. And, of course, they'll also be blown up by yours truly. (TL: This was a nightmare to translate.)On the other hand, the Great Tang Kingdom will watch the play unfold with their arms behind their backs with a three-lip grin. They may even write a few statements saying, \u201cWe are deeply regretful about the strife that has happened in your kingdom!\u201dThe tower defense will go on endlessly.So, to avoid it all, he had to spread his hands and say, \"When I get up every morning, I read the Bible of Light ten times. I think I've fully listened to the teachings of God today. When you saw me lying on the stone stool, I was actually practicing my holy magic in secret. On the surface, I'm lazy, but in fact, I've been practicing holy magic desperately over and over again. Ah\u2026 my body is filled with holy power and about to overflow.\"Little Yi's cold face looked suspicious. I can only believe you are practicing holy magic, but I was lazy just now. Laziness is one of the seven sins, and it almost led me astray.Of course, the seven sins aren't unforgivable as long as they are appropriately corrected. In the end, they will still be good believers, so she won't draw a line with Robb because of laziness. But she still had to remind Robb, \"With all due respect, may I ask to what extent is your holy magic now?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 31": "Chapter 31: We are inexplicably going to have a contestRobb replied, \"I feel pretty good about myself.\"Little Yi coldly said, \u201cIt\u2019s just your feeling. I have never seen a lazy strong man. You won\u2019t get strong without diligent practice.\u201d\"That's your misunderstanding.\" Robb spread his hands and said, \"Before you met me, my guild was unique. It was one in a million. How many players were there in \"Dark Blade\"? I was the first to take the clothes back then. I had several nicknames: The Grinding Emperor, The Demon of Xiuxian, Virgo's Feak, and the Pervert, who died while doing a patch update. My grinding tendency has long since been deemed a legend; although I've left the game, my legend is still being spread. I'm sure you've never seen such a hardcore grinder in your life.\"Little Yi didn\u2019t understand a word, \u201cWhat on earth are you talking about?\u201d\"I meant I'm hardworking, so I'm quite strong,\" Robb said.Little Yi, \"You said such strange things. Why did it turn short upon translation?\"Robb smiled and said, \u201cHa! This is called the secret of linguistics!\u201dLittle Yi\u2019s aloof style almost collapsed. This priest was just too weird. She didn\u2019t know why she always thought his smiles were cheap, especially his exclamations. Whenever he exclaims, it makes people feel the urge to yell at him, \u201cShut up, priest.\u201dOf course, they can't yell at him because \"Wrath\" is also one of the seven deadly sins. It's pointless to sin just to persuade another to stop committing another sin.She forcibly suppressed her soul, which tried to run away, and coldly said, \"But I feel that you're weak.\"\u201cThat\u2019s just an illusion. I\u2019m strong!\u201d\u201cBut I really feel that you\u2019re weak.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m amazing. Don\u2019t just talk about me. What about you?\u201d Robb said.Little Yi deliberately used Robb\u2019s tone and said, \u201cI am pretty good too!\u201dAt this point, the atmosphere became subtle and oddly played a glaring tone.\u201cThen should we have a match?\u201d It's unknown who said this sentence first or if both said it simultaneously. Still, it inexplicably turned into a situation where it was impossible to maintain a normal conversation regardless of victory.Robb said, \u201cIf we\u2019re having a contest, then we\u2019ll have one. Say the rules. What are we competing in?\u201dLittle Yi coldly said, \u201cLet\u2019s compare our Restoration magic. We\u2019ll compare which is more powerful, larger in range, and chant speed. If you lose to me, please spend your time practicing instead of lazing around.\u201dRobb said, \u201cThat\u2019s a constructive proposal, but why do you want to compete in restoration magic? Isn\u2019t it better to just compete in holy magic in general? Is it because you\u2019re unconfident?\u201dLittle Yi's face remained expressionless, and she chanted silently, \"Balder, God of Light, your faithful follow offers all my piety and faith to you. Please grant me holy power\u2026 Divine Punishment!\u201dA golden light flew from her fingertips and hit the ground next to her with bang. When the light dissipated, a big hole was left on the ground.She said coldly, \u201cSee, think I can use offensive magic?\u201d\u201cWow!\u201d Robb uttered an authentic priestly exclamation, \u201cAwesome, what a powerful \u2018Divine Punishment\u2019.\u201d But secretly, he thought, \u201cThe chanting of holy magic seems to be different from Xuelu\u2019s fire magic. I treated the townsmen's leg last time and used that nonsense, but it seems I was wrong. Urgh, forget it! I'll just watch my words in the future.\"He smiled and asked Little Yi, \u201cIf you can use offensive magic, why do you want to compete with restoration magic?Little Yi said, \"The God of Light is loving. He loves everything. Because of this, most magic he creates is used to cure patients and save lives. The limited offensive magic we have is a weapon we use when darkness strikes. It is not what God wants us to master! So, to find out who is more pious to the God of Light and who is more proficient in divine magic is better tested with restoration magic.\"*clapping* Robb applauded, \u201cAdmirable. I already knew how worthy of a nun you are, but\u2026 to compete in restoration magic? Do we go and find a group of townspeople, give them some serious injuries, and then cure them afterward?\u201dLittle Yi almost jumped and committed \"Anger\" again, \"Are you kidding me? Why is your idea for competition so cruel.\u201d\u201cThen what better way do you have?\u201d Robb asked.Little Yi said, \u201cYou see, the sun is about to go down. Soon, it\u2019ll be the time when monsters are most active. We can go into the mountain and find a group of goblins or ogres. We'll beat them with kindness and come to cure them.\"Robb: (\u256f\u00b0\u0414\u00b0)\u256f\ufe35 \u253b\u2501\u253bThis is definitely a fake nun, saying that offensive magic is not in line with the purpose of the God of Light but insane enough to the extent that people have to flip their tables in anger.However, this is ridiculous. Whatever a competition is, a competition. Robb is a lazy person, but he\u2019s unyielding. Only this kind of person can become the grinding emperor.After dinner, the sun set. It wasn't completely dark, so it was the best time to go into the mountains to find monsters to beat.Little Yi went o the red horse she rode and took her weapon. Robb saw that her weapon was a staff, not some magnificent staff used by wizards with precious gems at the top, but a staff made of pure wood with no gems embedded, an unadorned staff.Robb smiled and said, \u201cWow! It\u2019s a simple weapon. It goes well with a poor nun.\u201dLittle Yi didn't bother to talk to him and threw a white eye at him. After several seconds, she asked, \"Where's your weapon?\"Robb said solemnly, \u201cTo show that I\u2019m a real priest, I have no weapon. However, you do, so we can see that I am the man who truly loves everything and believes in the God of Light! I won before we even started using restoration magic.\u201dLittle Yi, \u201c\u2026\u201dSince she hadn't learned that Robb had slain a double-legged dragon from the mayor and the townspeople, she thought that Robb was just an average priest who hadn't learned much about holy magic. She thought, \"It seems that he can only run his mouth, but his actual combat effectiveness is weak. It'll be up to me to seriously injure monsters; all he'll have to do is use his restoration magic.She carried her staff on her shoulder and pointed at the mountains that had been dyed red by the setting sun, \"Let's go! Let's find if there's a goblin or an ogre, which are both good targets for our competition.\"\u201cAre you sure you want to do this? Goblins and ogres are not creatures you can play around with. Moreover, it's dangerous to enter the mountains after sunset. If ogres surround you, I won't save you.\"Little Yi said, \"I'll save you, though.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 32": "Chapter 32: It\u2019s you three againAt this point, there really isn't anything to say. Robb found that Little Yi's a strong nun. She has her own style. If this kind of woman was in the game, she'd be called the Grinding Empress! He's the Grinding Emperor, which seems to be a good match.\u201cWhat are you doing in a daze? Let\u2019s go hurry into the mountain before the sun goes down.\u201d Little Yi walked to the hillside behind the chapel.Robb whistled and followed behind.To be honest, Robb isn't looking forward to what'll happen next. That is, beating a bunch of goblins and then using magic faster than her. Robb doesn't need to chant to cast a spell, so he's unlikely to lose, but that isn't fun. Were it not for Little Yi's conviction, he wouldn't have bothered to do this.He put his hands in his pockets and walked a few steps before two heads suddenly appeared in the distance, two soldiers with the baron. They were dressed in leather armor, bows on their backs, and swords and quivers hanging around their waists. They seemed to be responsible for scouting around their camp.They saluted Robb and Little Yi and asked respectfully, \"Father and sister, are you two going up the mountain? It's dangerous in the mountains. Please be careful!\"\u201cIt\u2019s alright,\u201d Robb said with a smile, \u201cWe\u2019ll just knock some goblins down before coming back.\u201dThe expressions on the faces of the two soldiers were so wonderful that they seemed to want to ask, \u201cAre you sick? Why would you knock some goblins down at this time of day? It\u2019s your skulls that\u2019ll get knocked up, right?\u201dBut they were only minor soldiers and dared not complain about the priest and nun of the Church of Light.At this very moment!A strange blue flashed up on the hillside next to the cemetery, and then a magic array spread out on the hillside with a radius of about 5 yards. That is, it was 10 yards in diameter. A huge circle was drawn instantly; the next moment, it was filled with all kinds of strange magic symbols.Robb pointed curiously, \u201cWhat the hell?\u201dJust as he uttered these three words, Little Yi next to him also cried out, \"It's a teleporting array. Something is coming!\"\u201cAlert!\u201d The two soldiers shouted at the same time, \u201cBeware of enemy attacks!\u201dWhen several people said these words simultaneously, the 10-diameter magic array had been fully deployed and began to activate. Brushing the dirt away, a few figures appeared in the middle of the array, and then a huge figure appeared.The light of the magic array then disappeared, then finally, three people and a huge double-headed ogre.Those three people were people that Robb already knew, Gorda, Jike, and Xielu.The trio looked terrible. Gorda\u2019s heavy armor was full of holes and seemed to have suffered many heavy blows. His body under the armor was probably scarred. His face and head were covered with blood. And this shield that used to be on his left hand was gone. He had his sword in his right hand, but judging from how he held it, he had no strength left.Jike looks terrible too. There are black marks on his leather armor. It seems like he\u2019s been scorched by fireballs. Even his hair and beard were yellow and curled up. He had also suffered internal injuries that weren't visible to the naked eye.As for Xuelu, the fire magician, her left hand, left shoulder, and wand held in her left hand were frozen in ice, while her right hand was spread flat on her chest, holding a used magic scroll in the palm of her hand. The runes on the scroll dissipated, leaving only a faint, blue, scattered magic light still pervading over the scroll.It\u2019s obvious that Xielu used the life-saving scroll Robb had given her and was teleported here.Moreover, when they teleported, they failed to shake off the enemy and brought it back with them. Standing in front of them was a tall and fierce double-headed ogre, at least three meters in height, with arms as thick as buckets and a giant stick in its hand. It has two heads: one blue and the other red.Robb was quite familiar with this type of double-headed ogre. This was also in the game. It was not only physically powerful but could also use magic. The blue head on its left can spit ice arrows, while the red head on its right spits fireballs. It's a powerful monster with ice, fire magic, and high physical attack and defense.The boss, the double-headed ogre, is one level higher than Elite. (TL: Ranks are still vague, the author has been using the same term since)The ogre was confused. It still hasn\u2019t understood its situation because it was suddenly teleported.Robb took the opportunity to say hello to the three adventurers, \u201cWhy are you guys in a weird situation every time I run into you? Last time, it was against an Elite double-legged dragon. Now you guys are fighting a double-headed dragon. It\u2019s getting worse. The next time I run into you, will you guys be fighting against an elite black dragon?\u201dThe three adventurers heard Robb's voice and breathed a sigh of relief. Of course, there wasn't any time to pay attention to Robb's words.With the last of her strength, Xielu shouted, \u201cMr. Robb, help!\u201dShe just said these three words of help before the ogre moved. It's acclimated to the sudden teleportation and decides to kill the people around first. Xielu\u2019s stick fell because her left arm was frozen. She couldn't move, nor could she dodge.Gorda leaped from the side with the last of his strength. And with a loud bang, he and his sword flew in both directions, flying in two long parabolas mid-air, and fell miserably.Robb sighed, \u201cI can\u2019t even be lazy... Forget it, I'll do\u2026\"Just then, the sound of a bow being tugged suddenly sounded nearby, and two powerful arrows shot into the air and into the chest of the ogre. It turns out that the two soldiers nearby assisted. As soon as they sent the alarm, they immediately helped and shot two arrows at the ogre, just enough to stop it from attacking Xielu again.The attention of the ogre was briefly placed on the soldiers. It looked around and wondered where they came from.At this time, Little Yi\u2019s voice sounded, \u201cBalder, God of Light, your faithful follow offers all my piety and faith to you. Please grant me holy power\u2026 radius, 10 yards, Holy Nova!\u201dThe tip of the nun\u2019s wooden staff burst into a golden halo and spread in all directions, instantly shrouding the three adventurers and the ogre.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 33": "Chapter 33: You winWhen Little Yi made her move, Robb stopped and watched her abilities.As strong as he is, he doesn't know enough about this world. In this world, people don't have a panel suspended over their heads, no level, no BWH data, or the like. If you want to know the strength of others, you can only watch their battles live.The holy nova released by Little Yi instantly wrapped all three adventurers, causing them to feel a surge of warmth. Some of their wounds healed instantly.The three of them couldn't help but freeze slightly, a little unaccustomed to the situation. The last time Robb used holy nova, they were healed instantly and energized as well. However, this time, they only felt a little better and didn't fully recover after eating a sacred nova. It can only be said that they\u2019ve been healed from their moderate injuries, so at least they won\u2019t die.In fact, this is the normal power of holy nova!There is also the double-headed ogre that's shrouded by the holy nova, but it seems that it's only being tickled. Instead of paying attention to the caster, it focused on the two soldiers who shot the arrows on the hillside.Its red head opened its mouth and spat out a fireball the size of a football. It flew across the sky and hit the two soldiers. One of the soldiers took out a small leather shield. He knelt on one knee and used his shield to charge at the fireball.\u201cBang!\u201dThe fireball hit his shield and exploded. Fire surged on both sides of the shield, and the soldier swiftly fell back and rolled on the ground more than a dozen times before stopping. His leather armor had blackened everywhere.The other soldier turned to look at his companion, then shouted in the direction of their camp, \u201cHelp us! We can\u2019t handle this thing.\u201dA large group of soldiers then rushed out of the hillside. But instead of rushing to the front of the ogre, they bent their bows and readied their arrows, shooting at the ogre. The ogre turned his head and slapped the arrows with its giant stick. A small number of arrows were slapped down, but some of them hit. Within a few seconds, dozens of arrows had been laid on the ogre's body. However, they didn't seem to penetrate into its skin. Not a drop of blood was shed. It didn't even howl in pain. Instead, it yelled angrily at the soldiers.Its blue head on its left also opened its mouth, and an ice arrow was shot out towards the hillside. This time, no soldier foolishly tried to block it. They rolled away in an instant.The cold arrow hit the ground, and a large area of flowers and plants were frozen into ice.The ogre strode up the hillside and swiftly killed the group of soldiers.While this was going on, the three adventurers breathed sighs of relief. They looked at Little Yi, who had just cast a healing spell and then turned to look at Robb. They didn't know what was going on.Robb originally wanted to wave his hand to cure the three, but after glancing at Little Yi next to him, he gave up and asked, \u201cWhat trouble have you come across this time?\u201dGorda got up from the ground with difficulty and said, \u201cWe completed the mission of the villagers in White Birch Forest. We killed five or six ordinary ogres. And after getting our rewards, we left. But we didn\u2019t expect to meet an ogre boss on our way, and then\u2026 as you\u2019ve witnessed\u2026 Fortunately, Xuelu had an instant transmission scroll, which is surprising consideringits value.\"Xuelu didn\u2019t dare tell others that Robb gave it to her. She shook her numb left arm and said, \u201cThis life-saving scroll was given to me by my magic teacher. I\u2019ve treasured it for several years, but I didn\u2019t expect to use it here.\u201dJike shrugged. The archer doesn\u2019t talk as much as his two companions.Before Robb could continue complaining, Little Yi squeezed into the conversation, \"Are you free enough to talk? Raise your arms. I'll restore them for you. We must clean up this mess as soon as possible. The consequences would be unimaginable if we let the ogre run into town.\"With that, she chanted again because she knew full well that the holy nova she cast wasn't enough to heal all their injuries. She knew that she needed to use a much more effective spell.Xuelu looked curiously at the nun with a stern look on her face and said strangely, \"Who is this?\"Robb spread his hands and said, \u201cAs you can see, she\u2019s a nun from a big city. Before you came, we were supposed to compete in restoration magic. The plan was to go to the forest, find a group of goblins, beat them up with kindness in our hearts, and then see who can heal them faster and better.\u201dXuelu said in surprise, \u201cCompete with you? Isn\u2019t that just asking for defeat?\u201dGorda considered this differently from Xuelu. He laughed and said, \"Then why don't you treat us? We are in urgent need of help.\"Robb said, \"Indeed, Now that you\u2019ve said so, it seems that there is no need for us to beat goblins up. We can just compare to see who can heal you better, this fart nun or me.\u201dNo sooner than he finished his words, he heard Little Yi sing her chant and finish the closing notes, \u201cGroup Heal!\u201dThen, a holy light wrapped the three adventurers.This time, its effect was very good. The three felt their injuries recover quicker. And in a blink of an eye, their injuries healed.(Put simply, Holy Nova is a fast AOE spell with AOE damage and heal. According to the general rules of Western Fantasy magic, this fast and comprehensive spell is less powerful and is usually used to rescue people, albeit weakly. Group healing, on the other hand, takes a while to cast and doesn't have any offensive capability, so its healing effect is better than Holy Nova. It's usually used when the situation isn't urgent).Little Yi made a cold and arrogant face and said to Robb, \u201cI\u2019ve won!\u201d\u201cHa!\u201d Robb protested, \u201cYou used two magic spells to heal them. This is cheating. You didn\u2019t even agree to treat them. Cheating!\u201dLittle Yi said impassively, \u201cIt\u2019s not that I cheated, but that you lack the normal habit of using your holy light to benefit sentient beings and heal those around you whenever and wherever. This is a sign of your lack of practice in holy magic and your lack of faith in the God of Light.\u201dRobb secretly complained, \"Bull, I had a mouthful of milk when I saw people hurt in the game. I always planned to ask them what happened before throwing a cure at them, but I was worried that you'd notice that I don't chant. I'm worried about my identity being exposed, so I didn't cast a healing spell. But, I was ready to pretend to recite a few words for the chant before healing them. Who knew you were such a sinister nun? You unexpectedly rushed the situation.\"Forget it. I'm a man with a good temperament. I should be calm and give way to petty women.

After eating that fireball straight at its back, a large area blackened, and it was in pain. With a roar, it grabbed a large piece of stone on the ground and hurled it at Xuelu.Robb, with his quick wits, reached out and pulled Xuelu towards him. Xuelu fell into his arms, and the two tumbled in circles. When a hero and heroine first meet in a TV series, the hero also hugs the heroine and tumbles a few times. The stone passed through the place where Xuelu just stood, brushed past Robb, and flew towards their backs.Robb whispered, \u201cIs everything alright?\u201dXuelu grinned, \u201cYou saved me quickly, so of course I\u2019m alright. Look at us fighting so hard. You sure you don\u2019t want to help us deal with it?\u201dRobb was reluctant to release the girl in his arms, so he shrugged, \u201cI\u2019m too lazy to fight this kind of rubbish.\u201dXuelu pointed behind Robb, \u201cBut. your chapel seems to have been crushed.\u201dNani? Robb turned to look. Fuck. The stone didn\u2019t hit Xuelu but flew into the chapel yard instead and hit the wall instead. It wasn't as modern as to be built with steel and concrete, which can withstand a lot of pressure, so a hole was formed in the wall with the ogre's strength. Several pieces of furniture were knocked over and scattered around.\u201cI just bought those last year!\u201d Robb was furious, \u201cSon of a bitch, that ogre destroyed my house? How can I be lazy if I don't have a house? Food, clothes, and accommodations are the three fundamental needs of being lazy. You are shaking the foundations I've painstakingly prepared by destroying my house. What's wrong with being lazy? Why did you do this to me? I swear if we don't kill it today, I will not be called Robb!\"Xuelu playfully shrugged like Robb and said, \"I'm too lazy to find this kind of rubbish again!\"Robb put Xuelu aside and took a step toward the battle of the ogre and the soldiers, looking at the ground for a weapon to beat the guy.Beating this guy with his fists is no longer enough for him to vent his anger. Destroying a house is absolutely intolerable for the Chinese. These ogres just don\u2019t know how important \u201cHome\u201d is to the Chinese. Robe's home has already entered a serious situation.This ogre must die now! It\u2019s just a matter of how it will die now.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Nearly a hundred soldiers are fighting at it at the same time. They were well-trained, organized, and disciplined, but their individual strengths were weak, making it difficult for them to deal with the ogre, a BOSS monster. (TL: BOSS is a rank, I guess)The biggest problem is the ogre's \"Defense.\" The soldiers weren't strong enough to penetrate through the thick skin of the ogre, so their continuous attack didn't spell much trouble for the ogre.Baron Perseus, who was in command, frowned. His army was comprised of light soldiers, and when they came, it was to search the mountain. Because of this, when they selected its members, they deliberately chose light swordsmen and archers for easy maneuvering through the mountains.Although this kind of force is flexible and agile, its frontal combat effectiveness is not very strong. If it's against weak enemies, they can deal with them, but there's nothing they can do when they run into a thick-skinned monster like this ogre.It was not until Gorda, Jike, and Xuelu joined the battle that the ogre finally suffered some injuries. It was scorched by Xuelu and sustained a heavy cut on its leg, which cut through its skin and made it bleed. Jike\u2019s arrows are also more potent than their archers, shooting several holes into the ogre.Baron Perseus felt that the battle was nearing its end. He joined the battle himself, and with the three adventures, he might be able to take down the ogre. He drew his two-handed sword from behind and held It high.It turns out that this guy\u2019s a berserker.\u201cSoldiers, stand back!\u201d Baron Perseus roared, and his eyes turned red. This is a sign of a berserker\u2019s blood wrath. It burns his anger and doubles hit attack power, but simultaneously, his body becomes vulnerable.Of course, he wasn't afraid of getting hurt with the nun.With a roar and a sword in his hand, he rushed towards the battle, and when the soldiers heard his command, they moved towards the sides. Baron Perseus leaped high, raised his sword over his head, and cut down from top to bottom.\u201cDie! Mountain Beheader!\u201dHowever, he underestimated the ogre. The moment he leaped high, the ogre shone red. Gorda was startled and shouted, \"Be careful. It's using Bloodfury!\u201d\u201cBloodfury\" is the ability given to many monsters. It's similar to the blood wrath of Baron Perseus. And it greatly improves their combat effectiveness. The ogre seemed to have expanded in size. It has increased from three meters to four meters tall now.Baron Perseus jumped high, but when the other side suddenly enlarged, he only managed to reach the ogre\u2019s chest, and \u201cMountain Beheader\" lost momentum.Startled, he saw the ogre\u2019s stick seep over him and collide with his sword.\u201cBang!\u201dBaron Perseus flew like a sandbag. After several seconds, he sat up, shook his head, and said, \"This thing is more powerful than I thought.\"\u201cDon\u2019t act rashly, my lord! Let\u2019s cooperate.\u201d Gorda jumped in front of him and raised his shield. \u201cI\u2019ll attract its attention from the front, and you jump in and cut it from behind.\u201d\u201cOh! Let's cooperate then.\" Still feeling a little dizzy, Baron Perseus looked around and asked, \"Where is my sword?\"A soldier shouted, \u201cFather, can you please bring me the Baron\u2019s sword?\u201dBaron Perseus looked at where his voice was pointing, and it turned out that his sword had fallen beneath Robb's feet.Robb bent his back and picked up the sword with both his hands. He weighed it in his hand. Well, it\u2019s not bad. He\u2019s quite satisfied with the weight. Just when he was looking for a weapon to beat the ogre, a two-handed sword fell at his feet.\u201cFather\u2026 The baron\u2019s sword\u2026 heyy, hey, hey!\" The soldiers thought Robb would pick up the sword and hand it to the baron. But Robb picked it up, waved it with his hand, seemed satisfied, and then put the sword on his shoulder before walking towards the ogre.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d The soldiers were startled, \u201cIt\u2019s dangerous here. Don\u2019t come.\u201dBaron Perseus jumped up and said, \u201cMr. Robb, wait! Don't go and die. Give me the sword.\"He had just taken two steps before Gorda grabbed him. Gorda shook his head and whispered, \u201cMr. Robb must have a plan of his own.\u201dLittle Yi was also startled and wanted to call Robb back, but Xuelu grabbed her and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Let\u2019s see what Mr. Robb\u2019s going to do.\u201dSo, in full view of everyone\u2019s eyes, Robb stood in front of the ogre and looked closely at the monster.The bloodthirsty ogre was four meters tall and looked down at Robb, just like an adult looking at a six- or seven-year-old boy. He didn't even take a look and kicked Robb.Miss!The ogre kicked the air. It didn't know why; the other side didn't move at all. His huge foot kicked past a motionless person? It doesn't make sense!It kicked again, seemingly unconvinced.Miss!He still missed.The double-headed ogre felt its brain tremble, it had two heads, so when one head trembled, the other trembled as well. The blue head looked confused, while the red looked like Sparta.How would it know that if the agility gap is too big in the game, the hit rate of physical attacks will become 1%? Even if Robb stays still, the ogre's hit rate will only be 1%.This kind of thing can\u2019t happen in the real world. Robb can\u2019t make his own rules. Once anything happens, he can only eat the rules.However, even when he\u2019s motionless, the ogre only gets an average of one hit for every one hundred. Of course, even if it hits, it\u2019s useless if it can\u2019t break his defense, but that\u2019s a different matter altogether.Robb raised the sword with one hand, pointed at the ogre, and said, \"How dare you destroy my house? You are dead meat. Let me ask you, how many times do you want to be beaten to death?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Super fierce roar x2!Lifting its left foot, kick, MISS!Change to its right foot, kick, MISS!Wave stick with both hands and aim at Robb, MISS!Open left head mouth, spit cold arrow at Robb, RESISTED!Open right head mouth, spit out a big fireball at Robb, RESISTED!Ogre, \u201cI feel so tired!\u201dThe Baron, the three adventurers, the nun, and the soldiers who watched, were collectively confused.\"What happened?\"\"Damn.\"\"This is impossible!\"Under the dumbfounded gazes of everyone, Robb finally moved. Moreover, his move was the same as the one Baron Perseus used before he attacked.\u201cIt\u2019s blood wrath!\u201d Baron Perseus shouted, \u201cHey?! Mr. Robb is a berserker?\u201dThen, Robb jumped with a swoosh.Mountain Beheader!This was also the skill used by Baron Perseus. Just as the Baron was about to say it won't work, he saw that Robb struck the ogre with the sword. He moved so fast that the ogre had no time to react. It's impossible to stop Robb's mountain beheader.Then, Robb\u2019s sword moved from swiped from left to right, one strike, one cross, and followed by three chops, blood gas, anger burst, silver blade, mountain beheader, avalanche\u2026The Light of the sword was dazzling and dizzying. Their eyes seemed full of scattered sword flowers, all kinds of flashes, the air blowing strong, and all kinds of light particles flew around.At first, Baron Perseus recognized what Robb was doing, but as more time passed, he couldn't see him anymore. The naked eye wasn't enough to perceive Robb's actions. He could only see a vague figure chopping off the ogre with a giant sword. He couldn't see anything else.It's unknown how long it took, but it wasn't until everyone got out of a daze that they found out that Robb put away the sword and threw it casually. The blood scattered across the sky, and poof, it stuck on the ground in front of the Baron. He clapped his hands and said, \"Damn it, I accidentally killed it when I got to 943. I planned to dish out 1000. Now, my son is dead! Here's your sword. I won't play berserkers for a while.\"The crowd was speechless for a moment and looked at the double-headed ogre.No, it no longer existed. It only left a mess of visceral fragments, meat, and bones. Thanks to the fact that everyone\u2019s used to seeing blood and the dead, they didn\u2019t vomit on the spot.Robb said, \u201cSorry! That wasn\u2019t good. I wasn\u2019t careful enough. I accidentally beheaded it.\u201dAt this time, of course, he had to get out of the limelight. The people were confused, and when they came to their senses, they might ask why he was so strong. They might worship him. Then they'll ask him to help or something.He quickly reached out a hand and grabbed the confused Gorda, \"You!\" With a flash, his other hand held Jike, \u201cand you!\u201dHe clasped their shoulders and said, \"Go and fix the big hole in my chapel. It's the ogre you brought. It's your responsibility.\"Gorda, \u201c\u2026\u201dJike, \u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cHey, don\u2019t be in a daze and fix my house!\u201dGorda and Jike woke up abruptly, laughing with tears in their eyes, \u201cRepair, right?\u201dThe two men walked to Robb's chapel and walked a few steps before suddenly remembering something, \"Mr. Robb, why are you only bringing both of us? Doesn't Xuelu need to help? She also brought the ogre.\u201dRobb scolded with a smile, \u201cYou two, big men, how dare you ask a woman to do such a tough task? Cut the crap and hurry up.\"Gorda and Jike couldn't refute anything and obediently went to mend the hole in the wall.Meanwhile, before the shocked Baron Perseus, Little Yi, and the soldiers woke up from their confusion, Robb had already slipped away and waved, \"It's getting late. Let's all go home to wash up and sleep. Don't waste your time here. Go back and take a rest.\"Baron Perseus and Little Yi could only nod mechanically.Robb took Xuelu\u2019s hand and dragged her to the church, \u201cCome with me. I have something to tell you.\u201dXuelu didn\u2019t have any strength left, so she gently let herself be pulled and followed along.It was not until they returned to the chapel that they didn\u2019t know what to say.Baron Perseus on the side woke up from confusion, turned to Little Yi, and said, \"This\u2026 this priest. Who on earth is this sacred? My God, how does the church of Light have such a powerful berserker?\"Little Yi said awkwardly, \u201cI don\u2019t know. We have to ask him later. It seems that he is not an ordinary town priest.\u201dWhile Robb and Xuelu returned and came to the quiet confession room. This is the holiest place of the chapel, and it is almost impossible for anyone to eavesdrop here.As soon as Xuelu sat down, she gasped heavily. Although Little Yi cured the physical injuries, she still felt tired. This is not a problem that a single cure can solve. She stretched her tired hands and feet, rubbed the muscles on her calves, and complained, \"Damn it. I thought we only had to deal with a few ordinary ogres. I didn't expect to attract their leader\u2026\"Robb, \u201cIf you are this unlucky, how have you lived till this day?\u201dXuelu said, \u201cIt hasn\u2019t always been this bad. It was quite good before, but since I met you, my luck took a sharp turn for the worse, and I was almost finished twice in a row.\u201dRobb smiled and said, \u201cWow, now you blame me?\u201dXuelu smiled and said, \u201cHahaa! It\u2019s just a little joke. I know we\u2019ve got death luck. You\u2019ve already saved us twice. I really don\u2019t know how to thank you.She\u2019s a woman who likes joking very much. She always speaks freely. In fact, she wanted to make a joke and say, \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s enough to just promise to one another.\u201dBut before she could say the joke, she felt shy. She felt it was too early to play such a joke in their relationship, so she forced it behind her throat and said, \"What do you want to tell me by bringing me here?\"Robb said, \"Same as last time. Do you have any blank scrolls? Take it out. I'll make you another instant transmission scroll.\"Hearing this, Xuelu couldn\u2019t help but freeze slightly and felt moved, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. You gave me such a precious scroll last time, but I wasted it in a blink of an eye. Are you sure you want to make it now? The last time you made it was only a few days ago. Have you already recovered your lost magic power? If you haven\u2019t recovered, you\u2019ll be tired to death if you make another right away.\u201dRobb smiled and said, \u201cI won\u2019t die. Don\u2019t worry! If you don\u2019t want the scroll, it will make me worry more about the safety of your team.\u201dXuelu was inexplicably moved in her heart. They met by chance, but she really didn\u2019t know how to thank him enough for being able to do this for her party.Robb said, \"One more thing. Can I ask you a favor to make a fool out of what happened earlier? I don't want anyone to know that I'm powerful.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As always, thank you for your support.Chapter 37: Fooling around with this thingXuelu listened silently, \u201cHow can this even be faked? Your battle just now brought your berserker skills into full play. With so many people present, not one being blind, is it even possible to bluff out of this?\u201dRobb said, \"I didn't want to do it either. But when I just saw my house broken all of a sudden... Well, alas, I need to fix my house now.\u201dXuelu shook her head, \"I can't solve this problem for you. No matter what you say, no one will believe you are weak.\"\u201cThere\u2019s still a way.\u201d Robb said, \u201cI would like to ask you, in the system of Fengmo Continent, is there any magic that can instantly take a soul out of its original body and possess it? This of which suddenly makes the body powerful by borrowing the power of a hero?\"Xuelu nodded, \"There are similar records in the ancient magic system. For example, so-and-so got a cursed secret treasure, and so-and-so hosted the soul of a hero because he used the treasure. The treasure can cause the hero to possess the man's body and become very powerful temporarily, but he will be tired like a pile of mud afterward, taking a long time to recover.\"\"Well, this is good, then this is it.\" Robb said with a smile, \"If you have any worthless gems or strange magic tools on you, give them to me and tell others later that it is an ancient secret treasure with a Berserker hero. Um... Here we have to make up a powerful name for the Berserker hero. Let's just call him \u201cDora Dream\u201d. In short, there is a powerful soul housed in the gem. I just used the secret treasure, and then the soul possessed my body, and I became stronger. Now that the secret treasure has been used up, I will soon be tired and look like mud. It will take at least ten days, no, seven, seven weeks, and forty-nine days to recover.\"Xuelu was suddenly covered in sweat, \u201cHey, this is crazy. How would anyone believe it?\u201d\u201cI know it\u2019s hard to believe, \u201c Robb said, \u201cbut it\u2019s even more unbelievable than my red eyes and infinite murdering capabilities.\u201dWhen Xuelu thought about it carefully, it seemed that this was the case. Just now, Robb's eyes looked red, and he looked terrible. He stood still and let the ogre hit him several times. Then, there was that set of deranged attacks. Even if she, a person who already knew he was strong, found it unimaginable, it would be more difficult for others to believe it. You might as well believe that the secret treasure came out of nowhere.She touched around her pocket and found a small red gem, a ruby with a poor appearance looking like it wasn\u2019t valuable. \u201cWe, adventurers, are very poor,\u201d she said awkwardly, \u201cI have only one ugly stone on me. I don\u2019t know if it can be used to deceive people.\u201dRobb looked at it twice and said with a smile, \u201cThe stone is a little bad, but with a little magic, it can be used to deceive people.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d Xuelu was about to ask how he\u2019ll add magic to it when she suddenly saw a strange red light emitted by Robb. Then, the magic spread from Robb and drilled into the worthless ruby. The ruby, which looked like a broken stone by the side of the road, emitted a brilliant red light in an instant. It became dazzling red.Xuelu\u2019s beautiful eyes opened wide, \u201cHey, hey... This\u2026 this stone, wow! I feel that it has become great in an instant.\"\u201cFeel its magic,\u201d Robb said.Xuelu felt it carefully and was startled, \u201cThis.. what terrifying magic this is.\u201dRobb smiled and said, \u201cNow it can be used to deceive people, right?\u201dXuelu nodded fiercely, \u201cAbsolutely!\u201dRobb smiled and said, \"That's great, just say this\u2026.\" Robb arranged a play which was clear and vivid.It was dark at night, and most people of Westwind town had already gone to sleep, but Robb was bathing.The berserker occupation is inelegant. Robb was inevitably covered in blood and flesh, so Lillian heated a big tub of water. He was soaking calmy in the tub and looking at the stars while whistling and humming cold melodies.The sound of footsteps sounded. It sounded like two people. Robb didn\u2019t even have to look behind him to know that it must be Little Yi and the Baron coming, especially the heavy footsteps of the Baron, which sounded clearly in the silent night.\u201cMr. Robb, may I interrupt your bath?\" The Baron's footsteps stopped beside him, and Robb turned to look at the Baron while Little Yi stood a few steps behind the Baron. Her eyes weren't fixed on Robb but deliberately deviated from her first target, looking at the Black Pine Mountain Range at night. It is evident that the cold nun didn't want to look or was too embarrassed to look at a man taking a bath, even if only the head's exposed.Robb waved to the Baron, \"Don't bother. I'm thick-skinned and not afraid of being looked at while bathing.\"With admiration and respect on his face, the Baron said, \u201cMy father, I\u2019m sorry to bother you so late\u2026 but *cough* That is, the series of movies you used when you cut down the double-headed ogre\u2026 Although I\u2019m just a useless berserker, I can see that your series of attacks have reached the highest level of the occupation. I wonder where you learned such good fighting skills.\u201dThe Baron spoke in a humble tone. He was startled because he himself is a berserker. He knows full well just how powerful Robb's attack earlier was. He isn't sure he'll be capable of doing such a thing even if he practiced for another 20 years.Of course, it's not his fault. In the real world, training is slower. It's not that he doesn't work hard enough. It's just that Robb only needs to turn the plug on before.As soon as he finished asking, Little Yi also said, \u201cFather, I would also like to know how you can use that despite being a priest and clergyman of the Church of Light.\u201d That kind of\u2026 Cough\u2026 doesn\u2019t look like a priest\u2019s way of fighting.She intended to say \u201cinelegant, bloody, and cruel,\" but she felt it wasn't a good idea to say, so she said it more politely.There are some unwritten rules that western clergy must follow. Western clergymen usually don't use weapons such as swords and spears that can pierce holes in enemies or make the limb of an enemy fly bleeding. They usually use stuff like a staff, hammer, wand, and so on, hitting people through internal injuries. This is called being secretly evil. Otherwise, how can we embody the loving spirit of the God of Light?It is not priestly to chop a monster to pieces with a two-handed sword, as Robb did just now.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

And now, he calmly made one of his arms dangles on the edge of the tub.This action of his startled Little Yi. She thought Robb was getting out of the bath. She didn\u2019t want to see a man\u2019s naked body, so she quickly closed her eyes and said, \u201cHey, just talk, don\u2019t suddenly get out of the tub and act like a ruffian.\u201dRobb smiled and said, \"How did I even jump out of the tub? I only moved my hand, so don't make such a fuss because of nothing.\"\"Oh, that's fine then.\" Little Yi opened her eyes but was still too embarrassed to look over. She only glanced at Robb's side before seeing something clenched in Robb's palm.\u201cWhat are you planning to do?\u201d She couldn\u2019t help asking.\u201cI just want to explain how I became so powerful earlier. The thing I\u2019m holding in my hand should be able to explain my strength from earlier.\u201dLittle Yi\u2019s interest was suddenly picquet. She didn\u2019t even bother about the distinctions between male and female and took two steps forwards. Her eyes firmly locked on Robb\u2019s clenched fist.So did the Baron. More like, he was even more curious than Little Yi. The skills Robb used earlier was the pursuit of all berserkers. It was so beautiful and bright that Baron was jealous. It would be great if he could be as powerful. Now that the secret to that strength was in the palm of Robb's hand, he couldn't help but breathe faster and took two steps forward.Robb slowly opened his palm. It was so slow that the Baron wanted to rush up and break his fingers. After a few seconds, his palm was completely opened, and what appeared was a red gem. At a glance, the gem wasn't anything ordinary. It shone bright red, the favorite color of berserkers, and the color of their fate, just as the believers of the God of Like favor gold.\u201cThis\u2026 what is this?\u201d The tone of the Baron became slightly unusual, \u201cI like its color. Oh, I even feel power emitting from it.\u201dLittle Yi also looked at the stone without blinking. Unlike the Baron, who was a berserker with limited magic knowledge and weak sensing capabilities. Most of the time, berserkers like the baron judge things by a sigh and their sixth sense.However, Little Yi is a priest who deals with magic all year round, so she is much more magically capable than the Baron. She feels powerful power, overwhelming power from the gem.Little Yi couldn't help but ask, \"What on earth is this? I don't understand it, but it feels powerful.\"Robb shrugged, \"I picked it up in the mountains, and after I picked it up, I didn't know what it was. I felt it was very powerful, just like how you felt just now, so I carried it with me whenever I walked around. I felt angry when the ogre threw the stone and smashed my house. Then, the stone in my pocket suddenly injected a lot of power into my body, and I lost consciousness. When I came to be, I found that the ogre had been cut into pieces. Oh\u2026 I can swear by my devotion to the God of Light. I really don't know anything.\"Swearing to the God of Light was a very serious matter, so Little Yi immediately believed Robb's words. The Baron didn't even doubt a word, his eyes locked on the ruby in Robb's hands. It took a long time for the Baron to say, \"Father, do you mean that as long as you hold this gem, you can be as strong as you were earlier?\"Robb said solemnly, \u201cProbably, maybe\u2026 maybe that\u2019s right.\u201dThe Baron swallowed a mouthful of saliva and asked, \"This.. this is really.. amazing! What on earth is this?\u201dJust then, a cry sounded, and then a figure appeared. The red-haired magician Xuelu jumped from the size. She pointed at the gem in Robb\u2019s hand and shouted, \u201cOh, my God! It\u2019s a cursed ruby. I can\u2019t believe you have this thing. No wonder you were so strong just now.\u201dLooking like an Oscar-winning actor, Robb said, \"What is the cursed ruby?\"Beside him, the Baron and Little Yi also ignorantly asked, \u201cWhat cursed ruby?\u201dXuelu coughed and said in a mysterious voice, \u201cWhen it comes to cursed rubies, I have to tell a story. It started when I was an apprentice magician. I was locked up in the library by my master and was told to memorize the book \u201cThe Chants of Common Fire Magic\u201d to be able to get out. While doing so, I randomly browsed for books in the library to read.When Xuelu said that part of her story, Little Yi intervened and couldn't help but complain coldly, \"Since your master locked you up to read one book, why did you read other books?\"Xuelu said, \"Magicians aren't conformists in nature, unlike priests. We are full of curiosity and often never follow the rules. It isn't strange for a magician to read half a shelf of books before finishing one.\"Little Yi, \u201c\u2026\u201dWhen the Baron heard the two, he pulled them apart instantly. He couldn't help but say, \"Ladies, can you please get to the point? We are talking about the gem.\"Xuelu resumed storytelling and said, \"Well, continuing, I saw a book called the 'Cursed Treasure.' There was a page that happened to show the ruby in Mr. Robb's hand.\"\u201cOh, oh!\u201d The Baron got excited and asked, \u201cWhat is it? Say it. Say it!\u201dXuelu smiled and continued, \u201cThe cursed ruby is a secret treasure left by the great, yet unknown berserker, \u2018Dora Dream\u2019.\u201d\u201cDora Dream?\u201d The Baron said strangely, \u201cWhy haven\u2019t I heard of this ancestor?\u201dRobb complained, \u201cDo you think your knowledge is vast enough to know everything in the world? Can you recite the names of all your ancestors?\u201dThe Baron immediately looked embarrassed and quickly bowed his head, \"Sorry, I was arrogant. Please continue.\"Xuelu gave a thumbs up to Robb behind her back and continued, \u201cDora Dream, a berserker ancestor, was seriously injured in a battle with a strong enemy. Close to death, he asked his master to seal his soul in the ruby, waiting for a day to use others\u2019 bodies to continue to fight.\u201dThen, she pointed at the ruby in Robb's hand, \"This is the ruby! It's exactly the same as the one shown in the book.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Robb stopped talking and let the others guess the rest. Robbs knows this full well, and the script he arranged for Xuelu is about to commence.Sure enough, when Xuelu said it, she immediately shut up and put on a \u201cnow you understand\u201d expression.The Baron understood. He first cried \"Ah!\" and then said, \"I see. So the priest got angry when he saw that the ogre smashed his chapel, and anger is the source of strength for berserkers\u2026 so the cursed ruby activated, and the sealed soul of Dora Dream was released and attached to the priest. Then, Dora Dream temporarily controlled the priest's body and used his earth-shaking, powerful swordsmanship.\"\u201cYou are truly wise!\u201d Xuelu sighed, \u201cI think that\u2019s about correct.\u201dLittle Yi also understood and couldn\u2019t help but sigh, \u201cAh, no wonder I can feel tremendous power from this ruby. It houses the power of an ancient hero. It is truly commendable.\u201d\u201cSo what I found was such a powerful thing?\u201d Robb pretended to be ignorant, \u201cWow, then I will be invincible. As long as I am angry, I can call him out with this ruby. I don\u2019t have to be afraid of monsters in the future.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that easy.\u201d Xuelu said with a smile, \"There are side effects to this; otherwise, it wouldn't have been called a 'Cursed Ruby.' This kind of gem calls forth the power of heroes, which is usually beyond the normal capacity of a human body. You'll feel exhausted after use, whether it's energy or physical strength. You will be as tired as a pile of mud in the next seven to 49 days.\"\u201cHuh?\u201d Robb then said, \u201cAh? No wonder I feel powerless, to the point that I don\u2019t have the energy to move in the bathtub. Oh, my God. I lost too much energy and physical strength. Aah! Noo, I don\u2019t want to be unable to move for 49 days. I\u2019m a very hard-working person. I can\u2019t be lazy. I want to get up and work. I love work.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not laziness. It\u2019s magic. And not only that, if you keep it with you, it will keep sucking out your energy and strength until you become mummified.\u201d\u201cAh? I don\u2019t want to die!\u201d Robb frowned In pain. He struggled to climb out of the bathtub, but in vain, \"Damn this gem. It's absorbing my energy and strength. It's trying to kill me!\"Robb threw the ruby out of his hand.The secret treasure fell to the ground and rolled.The Baron cried, trying to reach out and pick it up from the ground, but Little Yi, next to him, suddenly pushed him away and said coldly, \"Baron, didn't you hear the magician's explanation? You must not be attracted to the curse of this secret treasure; else, you'll get sucked and mummified.\"\"But\u2026 but it contains the soul of Dora Dream, the ancestor of the berserkers. I\u2026 I want his power. If I could get such a combo out as he did, I would be so happy that I could die.\"\"You have sinned greed!\" Little Yi raised the stick in her hand and hit the Baron, \"Wake up!\"The blow sobered the Baron up, clearing his mind in the process, \u201cOh yes, greed is a great sin. It will kill me.\u201d\"We need to destroy it so as not to let it stay in this world to harm more people.\" Little Yi waved her staff and went to smash the ruby. A flash of red light appeared, followed by a dull sound. Little Yi\u2019s staff was deflected, bounced, and fell ten yards away.\u201cI don\u2019t have enough strength.\u201d Little Yi shouted, \u201cBaron, it\u2019s up to you.\u201dThe Baron clenched his teeth but resolved himself and resolutely drew his big sword. His eyes turned red with blood. He raised his sword with both his hands, held his head high, and shouted, \"Mountain! Beheader!\u201dThe double-handed sword, fueled by the Baron\u2019s anger, headed towards the cursed ruby. The fierce blade cut open the surface of the stone instantly. With a flash of red light, the magic in the gem surged out, carrying with it a strange sound. It was as if a voice could be heard laughing in its midst, \"Hahahaha!\u201dThe voice flew higher and higher as if it had been a long time since it\u2019s felt such a thing.And finally, the red light dissipated. The red ruby became dim and looked like an ordinary stone by the roadside.The Baron raised his hands and sword high, gesturing for victory. Tears fell from his eyes, roaring, \"I did it. I didn't just cut a gem. I separated myself from greed and desire! I crossed the most difficult wall to penetrate for growth! I defeated myself!\"The \"weak\" Robb couldn't help but give the Baron a thumbs up, \"You win! The rarest thing for human beings to do is to defeat their inner selves. You have done it. I do not doubt you will achieve greater achievements than your berserker ancestor 'Dora Dream'. Only by relying on yourself can you surpass him.\"\u201cHa, ha, ha!\u201d The Baron looked up at the sky and smiled fiercely. He picked up his big sword with both his hands and walked proudly to the camp on the hillside. Everything he experienced today will become a precious experience in his life that enabled him to continue forward.Little Yi went closer to Robb, silently picked up her stick, and told Robb, \"Don't you have no energy and strength? Let me help you back to your room.\"\u201cHow can I?\u201d Robb said, \u201cI\u2019m naked. You\u2019re a girl, so it\u2019s not appropriate.\u201dLittle Yi shook her head, \"When I am saving lives, I am no longer a woman but a messenger of God. Whether you are dressed or not makes no difference to me. You are just a weak patient now.\"\u201cHm, it\u2019s still not fine.\u201d Robb said, \u201cIf I rest a little longer, I should be able to go back.\u201dXuelu stood nearby and said, \"Sister, you can leave first. I'll help Mr. Robb back to his room. I brought the ogre here, so I'll take responsibility.\"Little Yi thought about it carefully. After all, she was still too embarrassed to see a naked man's body. Since miss magician is willing to help, that should be fine.\u201cThen I\u2019ll go to bed. Good night.\u201d She said coldly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The Oscar-winning actor and actress looked at each other and laughed.Xuelu chuckled and said, \u201cThey are so gullible! Are nobles and nuns really so na\u00efve and gullible?\u201dRobb said, \u201cIt\u2019s not that they\u2019re gullible, but rather, they\u2019d rather believe in the power of a secret treasure than to believe I\u2019m strong. It\u2019s easy for them to make the wrong choice.\u201dXuelu said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be so gullible.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because you haven\u2019t seen what I look like when I\u2019m lazy,\u201d Robb said.Hearing this, Xuelu couldn't help but shrug and say, \"I don't understand. Why are you being so lazy in such a small town? At first, I thought that you were being chased after, so you had to remain hidden. However, when I saw the Baron of the kingdom of Gran and the nun of the Church of Light talk with you peacefully, I knew you weren't being chased. You have no reason to hide in such a small town. With your skills, you can easily live a lavish life in any large city. Or, you could take plenty of risks and hunt the most ferocious of monsters and find the most mysterious of treasures?\"Robb shrugged, \u201cWhat\u2019s the point in getting ahead of others and living a lavish lifestyle? What\u2019s the use in fighting monsters? What about mysterious treasures? It doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201dXuelu didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry, \u201cWhat is the point of living a life like an eastern rabbit monk living an isolated and monastic lifestyle?\u201dRobb smiled and said, \u201cWell, Miss Xuelu, please stop trying to persuade me and let me be lazy. I will always be here waiting for you to come back to see me the next time you use instant transmission scrolls.\u201dXuelu said solemnly, \u201cI don\u2019t use those easily!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t plant flags!\u201d\u201cWhat does it mean to plant a flag?\u201d\u201cHa, I\u2019m too lazy to explain.\u201d\u2026\u2026That night, Xuelu took a bath using Robb\u2019s tap water system. She couldn\u2019t help but marvel at the invention. After the bath, she changed into clean clothes. Robb was shocked. The magician with red hair and slightly wet eyes - It\u2019s really sexy and hot.However, Xuelu\u2019s other two party members weren't so lucky. They've been repairing the chapel all night. They weren't good masons at all. If the hole in the chapel was fixed by a real mason, it would at most take an hour or two, but the two were busy all night, and by the dawn of the next day, the church was finally fixed. The two fell asleep with their heads tilted on the grass.The most tragic thing was that as soon as they fell asleep, they were awakened by the shrill whistle on the hillside and opened their hazy eyes, only to find that the scout team led by the Baron was ready and about to march into the Black Pines Mountains.Robb, who had always liked sleeping till late, rubbed his eyes and went out of the church. He wore a tubed nightdress. With a cup in his hand and a toothbrush, he stood by the faucet on the edge of the field and filled up his cup with water. He brushed his mouth, murmuring, \u201cWhat? Are you kidding? Whistling at dawn?! Don\u2019t you have any sense of morality?\u201dLittle Yi, wearing a nun's outfit, was carrying a wooden stick and a small bag. She got up and came out of the room she chose in the chapel. She was stunned when she saw Robb brushing his teeth in the yard. She said, \"Father, weren't you cursed by the ruby and had your physical strength and energy absorbed? Don't you need another forty-nine days to recover? Why can you walk around so freely?\"Robb also couldn\u2019t help but freeze. He secretly scolded in his heart, \u201cI forgot! I was half-awake when I woke up. I only remembered to brush my teeth.Don't panic; keep steady. He hurriedly put up a holy face, \"I desperately recited the Bible of Light last night and begged the God of Light for a favor. Perhaps it was because I was very religious, but the God of Light gave me something like a miracle. I suddenly returned to a state of barely being able to move. Now, although I can't use all my strength, I can use a bit, enough to wash my face and brush my teeth.\"The nun, who was pure and untainted in heart, was easily deceived. She nodded to Robb and said, \"That's great! In this way, I can feel at ease. Have a good rest. We'll come to you when the Baron and I find the evil necromancer.\"\"You're welcome,\" Robb said.\"Father, sister.\" The Baron strode to the two: \"We are about to leave!\"\"Ok, I'm ready as well.\" Little Yi nodded to him.Robb waved, \u201cI wish you success in finding the evil necromancer for the lord to send his troops as soon as possible. And maybe, the dozens of skeletons stolen from Westwind town can be recovered.\u201d\u201cI hope so!\u201d The Baron smiled and said, \u201cNow I have the confidence to face the difficulties that will block my path.\u201dRobb could see that this guy really seemed different. After smashing the ruby last night, he probably came upon a realization. Although the stone is fake, the demon that the Baron cut is real. He really cut off his greed and desires, so he'll achieve growth.\u201cSir Baron, sister.\u201d Gorda\u2019s voice sounded nearby, \"I was listening to your conversation just now. It seems that you are going into the mountains to search for some bad guy?\"\"Yes!\" The Baron didn't hide it at all and said, \"We are pursuing an end to a huge controversy.\"\u201cOh, that seems great!.\u201d Gorda grinned and said, \u201cWould you allow us to go with you? As you can see, the three of us are very powerful adventurers. The Black Pine Mountains where you are about to go to isn\u2019t a peaceful place. It\u2019s full of unknown dangers. Although the 100 soldiers under your command are well-trained, they are just soldiers, after all. Their combat strength can be seen clearly in yesterday's battle. I think together, with the three of us, will make your pursuit go more smoothly.\u201dThe Baron was slightly stunned. The yes or no question was easy for him. Three seconds later, he held out his hand to Gorda and said, \u201cYou\u2019re welcome to join us. I\u2019m willing to pay you twenty gold coins for this mission.\u201dGorda smiled and said, \u201cTwenty for three isn\u2019t easy to divide. Do you want us to fight amongst ourselves? I think you should make it 21.\u201d\"It's a deal.\"Robb put down his cup and toothbrush and snarled, \"I say, Gorda, do you even know what the Baron is dealing with? You're too rash to take on such a task with more than seven hundred skeletons and a powerful necromancer. You'll have to get close to death again within a few days.\"Gorda laughed, \"Are there any adventurers that don't brush close to death every day? People who are afraid won't take risks.\"Behind him, Jike and Xuelu shrugged, saying nothing, but agreed to Gorda\u2019s words.Robb thought, \"Do you really want to worry me like this? Although he gave Xuelu another instant transmission scroll, he still felt worried. Urgh, who am I to get so sentimental?\u201dHe said to everyone, \u201cWait a minute, I\u2019ll get something from the warehouse for you.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was messy and had a lot of things, such as metal ingots, herbs, grains, and animal skin. All of them were sent by the townspeople. He had been in this town for around ten days, and during this period, he listened to confessions and made tap water. In addition, he did something that every priest couldn't avoid: curing the townspeople.The four major industries of this small town are mining, herb gathering, hunting, and agriculture. The first three are risky, often encountering danger. Today, a person broke a leg, and the next day, there'll be someone hurt by a monster. And the day after that, some herbalist was poisoned by a snake.And then, there are diseases!Since there hasn\u2019t been a priest in this town for the past several years, the townspeople either took medicine indiscriminately to treat their illnesses or were forced to take a slow death. Dozens of townspeople had severe chronic diseases and had no way to be cured. As soon as Robb came, they hurriedly asked for help.Robb was lazy, but it wasn\u2019t to the point that he won\u2019t help them. Not to mention, after each healing session, after the townspeople recover their health, they were often grateful enough to give something to Robb in return.However, they were relatively poor. Most of them couldn\u2019t afford to send money, so they simply gave their harvests to Robb.Therefore, this pile of metal ingots, herbs, grains, and animal skins was in the church's basement warehouse. Of course, none of them are of high quality!Robb doesn't need any of these other than the food, but it will come in handy today.He first picked up a few iron ingots and put them in front of him. Then, he took a few pieces of coal and used his forging skills. In a blink of an eye, the iron ingots and coal merged into \u201cSteel Ingots\u201d.Then, there was another round of forging - \u201cSteel Armor\u201d has been successfully forged.\u201cQuickshot Birch Bow,\" \"Silver-plated Arrow,\" forged successfully.This way, Gorda and Jike can be armed. He was about to leave before suddenly thought about the cold nun. Though he was at odds with her, he felt that she wasn't a bad person. So he had to prepare something for her. He looked at the few materials left in the warehouse\u2026 What should I give? Oh, yes, something that seems to be suitable for nuns!After a while, Robb completed what he needed to do and came back to the yard.By this time, the Baron was getting a little impatient. As soon as he saw Robb come out, he quickly said, \"Oh, good. Mr. Robb is finally out. I was worried you won't come out in a long time.\"Everyone looked at Robb curiously and saw him drag a huge bag out. They didn't know what was inside, but it seemed heavy.Little Yi couldn't help but wonder. This guy said he won't have any strength for forty-nine days, but he got up early this morning. And now, he's dragging such a heavy bag. I'm afraid that he was acting yesterday.However, while she was skeptical, she had no evidence, so she had to be patient for the time being.Robb first went up to Gorda and said, \u201cWhen you fought with the double-headed ogre yesterday, your iron armor was riddled with holes. I think it\u2019s unreliable. I\u2019ll give you better armor.\u201dHe reached into the bag and grabbed the steel armor out of it. He threw it to Gorda and said, \u201cTake it.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Gorda knew at a glance that the armor wasn\u2019t anything ordinary. Steel was much stronger than iron. Moreover, the craftsmanship of the armor was perfect. It was something only one of the best blacksmiths could make Moreover, it had a faint yellow light, the unique color insinuating a defense enchantment. From the intensity of the light, it was a very advanced enchant.Gorda couldn't help but exclaim, \"What great armor! This\u2026 is not normal. Is it really for me? If you want to charge me, I can't afford it.\"\u201cHere you go.\u201d Robb said, \u201cI got this a long time ago when a knight who was seriously ill and about to die confessed his sins. He entrusted me with his legacy and asked me to give it to a brave soldier. I think you are fit to inherit this equipment. Take it.\u201dWith that, Robb went to Jike, took out the bow and silver arrow from the bag, and said, \"These are for you. The enemy you'll be facing this time has at least 700 skeletons. God knows if there are any other undead that he has. The best equipment to deal with the undead is silver. I don't have much silver, so I couldn't make a silver arrow. It's only a silver-plated arrow, but it should be much better than an ordinary arrow.\"Jike also understood. He first took a look at the bow. It is clearly a birch bow, but it was shining in green \u2013 the color of agility. It\u2019s bright green, indicating that the enchantment level is not any lower than that of Gorda\u2019s armor. This is also a bow that he couldn\u2019t afford to buy.If you look at the arrow, it's clear that it's only a silver-played arrow. However, it has a faint golden light. It seemed to have been enchanted with the holy power, which has increased damage towards the undead. It's a good arrow! However, this is a problem\u2026 I'm reluctant to shoot such a precious arrow.The arrow needs to be collected after each shot!The two were moved and didn\u2019t know what to say after receiving such great gifts.After several seconds, Gorda curiously asked, \u201cMr. Robb, why didn\u2019t you give Xuelu anything despite giving Jike and me gifts?\u201dRobb solemnly said, \u201cBrothers are brothers while women are like clothes. I value you two more, so I don\u2019t care about Xuelu.\u201dGorda and Jike, \u201c\u2026\u201dXuelu secretly touched the second instant transmission scroll she received in her pocket, smiling like a fox. However, regretfully, she said, \"I really don't understand the friendship between you men.\"After that, Robb walked over to Little Yi and said, \"Little Yi, we are all believers of the God of Light. I sincerely hope that you won\u2019t encounter any danger. I have something for you, too.\u201dLittle Yi's cold face couldn't help flash a slightly moved expression, \"I acted somewhat against you, yet you have something to give me? Father, you are very tolerant.\"\"It was easy for me to decide.\" Robb said, \"Yesterday, when I saw you hit the ruby with the stick and have it bounce off. Together with the fact that your holy nova and divine punishment are mediocre against enemies. I feel you lack the means to deal sufficient damage to the enemy.\"\u201cI am the messenger of the God of Light. I don\u2019t need the means to deal damage to the enemy.\u201d Little said coldly.\"However, sometimes you'll need it. As you've said, light needs to beat the dark, so you'll need a good weapon to make up for your lack of attack,\" Robb said.Although Little Yi isn't greedy, after listening to Robb, she became curious and said, \"Alright! Thank you for your kindness. Is it a staff or a scepter?\"Her eyes were fixed on Robb\u2019s hand, thinking that no matter how good the weapon was, she might not be able to wield its power.While thinking about this, Robb's hand came out of the bag, and together with it, a pair of silver-plated short firearms! It shone with golden light.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I went on a short vacation with my family to Gensan and arrived home the other day. However, when we came home, we all contracted covid, so I couldn't focus much on translatingChapter 42: The successful creation of the holy gun nunThe pair of silver-plated short firearms are only as long as an average person\u2019s forearms. They are small and delicate \u2013 pocket-sized.As soon as he took it out, the several people present immediately gave it a stare.Though firearms aren\u2019t exactly a rare thing in this world of swords and magic. It has undergone many years of development since its creation by dwarven craftsmen.To this day, dwarven and human craftsmen continue to transform and strengthen firearms. Its technology becoming greater and greater by the day, constantly moving towards something light and small to be carried.However, no one present has ever seen such a small firearm.Gorda and Jike couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cDoes this pair of firearms actually work?\u201dRobb smiled and said, \u201cOf course it does. Watch.\u201dHe took a steel ball and stuffed it into the firearm's barrel. Then, he held it up and pulled the trigger, pointing at a tree about five yards away. All he heard was a bang before smoke appeared from the tree. The people present stared and saw that a deep hole had been made by the steel ball in the middle of the tree trunk.\u201cWow, such a small firearm actually works! This is amazing.\u201d The baron couldn\u2019t help but marvel. \u201cWhat clever craft this is, such a light and ingenious firearm. This is simply amazing. Where\u2019d you get such a great thing?\u201dRobb made it, but he couldn\u2019t just say it. He put on a face of a reminiscing person and leisurely said, \u201cIt\u2019s a long story. Three years ago, I met a dwarven craftsman in a valley. He was\u2026\u201d He deliberately acted like it's difficult for him to explain, and it'd take half an hour to prepare himself, so the baron hurriedly said, \"Oh, so it was a dwarven craftsman who gave it to you?\"\"That's right!\" Robb said, \"In short, this story began when I got acquainted with a dwarven craftsman\u2026.\"The baron hurriedly said, \u201cWell, Mr. Robb, we\u2019ve got to hurry into the mountain. Please tell the story next time.\u201dRobb didn't really want to make up a story and deliberately made it easier to interrupt. Of course, he didn't make it up. He smiled and said, \"Well, let me just say the result: this pair of short firearms are suitable for Little Yi. Although your fighting skills and strength aren't good enough, the strength requirements of this weapon itself are near zero. You only have to take it out, load, aim, and fire. With that, you'll be able to do enough damage to the enemy. It should be able to compensate for your weakness in attacking, so I'll give this to you as a gift.\"\u201cHuh? But\u2026\u201d Little Yi hesitated. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t suit the style of us priests. We usually don\u2019t use weapons that make enemies bleed a lot.\u201dRobb said, \"Usually not, but you should when it's dangerous. For example, last night, when you tried to destroy the cursed ruby. Your staff bounced off because you lack strength. At that time, it would\u2019ve been nice if you could find a short gun and destroy the ruby.\u201d\u201cThat\u2026 that makes sense.\u201d Yi hesitated.Robb continued, \"And as you can see, these two short firearms are so small that you can tie them to your thighs and cover them with your skirt. No one will notice that you're carrying such a weapon and doubt your belief in the God of Light. As long as your faith is strong enough, you won't have to worry about misusing it to kill innocent people and breach the teachings of the God of Light, right?\"Little Yi said, \u201cit seems like the more I listen, the more it makes sense.\u201dRobb put the pair onto her hand, \u201cThen take it! There are two belts here. Use them to hang the guns onto your thighs.\u201d\"Oh, alright!\" Little Yi quickly took it, went behind the tree, and hung the two firearms on her thighs. She then came out with her skirt down. No one will notice that she has guns hanging from her thighs.Robb solemnly said, \"Yi, I think you'll need some basic training before you leave. Come! Try it. When you\u2019re in danger, quickly shake your skirt and pick up the firearm from your thigh and make a shooting position. It must be fast, accurate, and stable enough to access its full power.\u201dLittle Yi was unaware of the plan, but she still did it according to Robb's words. She turned on the ground, and with the inertia of her rotation, her skirt made a beautiful flutter. Her hands quickly went towards her thigh and took the firearm into her hand. Then, she half-squatted and pointed at the big tree next to her. However, she didn't pull the trigger because the God of Light loves everything, which meant not hurting the tree.Although this is the first time she's done this, it's still beautiful and vigorous, fitting for her ice-cold temperament. It gives off the feeling of \u201cKiller Nun\u201d.Robb laughed strangely in his heart and said with delight, \u201cIt\u2019s a success! The successful creation of the holy gun nun truly is pleasing to the eye. Hah! A nun must be hung with the word 'killer'; otherwise, what kind of could it possibly be?\"Yi put down the firearm and turned to face Robb, \u201cFather Robb, thank you for your generous gift. I will not misuse this thing easily. I will only take it out and use it in the most serious of times.\u201d\u201cMhm!\u201d Robb nodded, pretending to be serious, \u201cThat\u2019s how it should be.\u201dLittle Yi looked confused, \"Why do I feel you are always smiling?\"Robb\u2019s face glowed with holiness, \u201cI\u2019m not smiling. You can tell from the wrinkles on my face.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t see the wrinkles, but I can\u2019t help but feel that you\u2019re smiling. Not to mention, it\u2019s a wicked, evil smile.\u201d Little Yi said, \u201cit\u2019s like you\u2019re digging a hole for others to jump in, but they still thank you for it.\u201dRobb put on a heartbroken expression, \u201cSister! I generously gave you the weapon I\u2019ve treasured for many years. You\u2019ve seen how happy Gorda and Jike are, but you still doubt my intentions and say I'm digging a hole for you? Is that what the God of Light taught you? Is this how you respond to the kindness of others? Tell me\u2026 I gave you a pair of rare firearms; how can they be considered harmful? Alas! I feel disappointed. I'm extremely disappointed. I can no longer feel sincerity and trust for the world. I only see doubt and vigilance. O' God of Light, save this confusing world.\"He quickly said in reduced volume, \"Unless you show me your act of spinning your skirt and taking the gun from your thigh again, I\u2019ll stay angry.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What did you say at the end? I didn\u2019t hear it clearly?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything,\u201d Robb said. \u201cI was just talking to myself because I\u2019m sad and depressed, so I lost my temper.\u201dLittle Yi didn't hear the second half of Robb's unscrupulous words but only listened to the first with great regret and remorse. Father Robb gave me such a great thing, yet I suspected he was digging a hole to harm me. I was really acting outrageously. I've shamed the teachings of the God of Light. She hurriedly looked down and bowed before apologizing sincerely, \"I'm sorry, I was wrong.\"\u201cForget it. As long as you know your mistakes, the God of Light will forgive you. I\u2019ve said all that I have to say. I wish you a pleasant journey,\u201d Robb said.Waving his hand, he watched the Baron, Little Yi, Gorda, Jike walk towards the hillside, with Xuelu a little behind. Seeing that everyone else was far away, she approached Robb and said with a soft smile, \"Did you just make these weapons in the warehouse?\"Robb smiled and said, \"No, I don't know how to do that.\"Xuelu smiled and said, \"You are amazing! I'm the one who helped you with the Ruby and fool them. Oh, you can't fool me now.\"Robb smiled and said, \"It\u2019s alright. I can kill you.\"\"Ha!\" Xielu was not afraid at all. She cast a little wink at him and then walked quickly to the hillside, and after a few steps, she turned and waved to Robb and said, \"I\u2019m looking forward to seeing you next time.\"Robb shrugged and said, \u201cYou can bring your pretty face, but don\u2019t bring trouble.\u201dXuelu laughed, waved to him, and turned to catch up with the group.Robb returned to the stone stool in the courtyard, sat down, and activated detection, which had a range of 5000 yards, so that he could see the movements of the baron and Gorda\u2019s party, all of whom first went to the cemetery and crouched beside the dug-up graves.Jike studied the traces on the ground very carefully. The skeletons in the dozens of empty tombs were stolen more than ten days ago, and although so many days had passed, Jike easily found the footprints they had left when they walked into the mountain.He probably used something like \"Track\" and soon found the way which pointed up the hill, then the baron waved. A small group of scouts went first, and the rest of the soldiers grouped and followed.They weaved past the trees, crossed a stream, climbed a stream, and finally went out of Robb's range.When these people were around, Robb was afraid that they'd trouble him to the point that he couldn't be lazy. However, when they left, he looked at the empty church and felt lonely again. Just like a group of your teammates you practiced with for several days in a row suddenly saying that they won't be online for a while, you'd suddenly feel a sense of loss and loneliness.This feeling is annoying!He finally realized that he's actually quite the hypocrite.\u201cLillian!\u201dRobb gave a loud cry.\u201cComing!\u201d Lillian immediately came out of the kitchen with a kettle In hand. It seemed that she'd just boiled a pot of water for Robb. She dashed with the kettle and went beside the stool. She asked while pouring water onto the teacup on the stone table nearby and said, \"What can I do for you?\"\u201cI don\u2019t have any orders. Sitting alone is boring. I want you to sit next to me.\u201dLillian looked up with a smile on her little face, \u201cAlright!\u201dAfter pouring water for Robb, she sat obediently on another stone stool opposite the stone table and picked up a sewing kit, \u201cMaster, will it be alright if they go for the necromancer?\u201d\u201cProbably not.\u201d\u201cMaster, will the necromancer come to our town?\u201d\u2018I hope so. I\u2019ll prepare the fan and wait for him!\u201d\u201cFifth gear, right?\u201d\u201cHaha, you are understanding me better and better.\u201dThe master and servant finally returned to their daily cycle.In a blink of an eye, two days passed. So far, no news has come from the baron and the rest of the group. The Black Pine Mountain range was so large that it couldn't be explored in two days.Today, Lillian began to sew something called underwear, which was \"invented\" by Robb, but Robb only showed her a sample but did not make it himself.Robb himself can't do it because his tailoring skills came from the game. Although he can turn a piece of cloth into a robe, cloth armor, or maid outfit in mere seconds, he can't make \"Clothes that don\u2019t exist in the game.\" Not to mention, underwear can\u2019t be tailored in the game \u201cDark Blade\u201d.Robb wore the underwear when he traveled had already been washed several times, and every time he washed his underwear, he had to take a day off, which made him feel very uncomfortable as he came from modern times. So, he took his only pair of underwear as a sample for Lillian to study and copy.At this time, on the table in front of Lillian was Robb's only pair of underwear, and she was holding two pieces of cotton cloth in her hand, studying to sew them together to make a new pair of underwear.Seeing her stare at his underwear, turning it over and over, Robb couldn't bear it and said, \"I mean, Lillian, it's quite easy for a person like me to be shy when you stare at my underwear like this.\"\"Huh?\" Lillian looked up and said, \"I\u2019m only looking at a piece of cloth. Why is master feeling shy?\"\"Those are my underwear. Can I not be ashamed of having it stared at by the opposite sex?\"\"But I won't be shy!\"\"That's because you're not wearing underwear at all.\" Robb said angrily, \"after you've made me a pair of underwear, you'll make two pairs for yourself to put them on. Then I'll stare at your changed underwear and turn it over and over in my hand. Let\u2019s see if you\u2019ll feel shy.\"Lillia still didn\u2019t understand!She sewed up the last few stitches, unfolded them, and said, \"Master, it\u2019s done.\"\u201cOh, that\u2019s great!\u201d Robb hurriedly took the underwear she had just sewed. At this time, he was wearing his \u2018father\u2019 clothes, a black tube outfit. He lifted up his man-skirt and put on the underwear on the spot. It felt good. Lillian's tailoring skills are not bad. This underwear is exactly as comfortable as the underwear they made in modern times.While happy, he suddenly heard a man's voice, \"Father, you seem to be in a good mood today.\"Robb turned around and saw that it was the mayor with a square face. He was standing at the yard gate with a smile, holding a large jar in his hand, \"I brought you some apple juice.\"Robb smiled, \"Why are you sending me something all of a sudden in broad daylight?\"The mayor smiled, \"My water reservoir is working now. With that thing, it feels much more convenient. When I want to use water, water will rush out as soon as I twist the faucet. When there is no water, I'll just let the slave use the pump for a while and soon fill the reservoir. It's really great. I think this is the new technology brought to us by Father, so I thought to bring you something. I squeezed some apple juice at home, so I packed a jar for you.\"Robb smiled and said, \"you're welcome. It's just a little thing.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Father, ask your maid to come to my house if you want more. I have plenty.\"Robb smiled and said, \"Thank you!\"Instead of acting polite to the mayor, he smiled calmly, opened the jar, and looked inside. The jar of apple juice smelled delicious and looked really good.Lillian quickly poured him a glass, and Robb took a sip, \"Gee, it tastes good. The freshly squeezed apple juice is good. If I were to make a complaint, it's not cold.\"The mayor said with a smile, \"it's summer, of course; it can't be made cold, but Father can seal the jar, soak it in a well, and take it out when you want to drink it. Alas, it is more convenient for the men in the city because they can find ice magicians at any time and ask them to cool their juices with ice magic, which tastes great.\"\"Oh? Ice magic? \" Robb's eyes lit up, and he said, \"ha, I can do something about this!\"The mayor said, \"Oh? Does father have a way?\"As soon as he finished asking, he heard Robb's mouth murmur the chant: \"God of Winter\u2026 Please listen to my request and lend me the power of winter. Come, Ice Arrow!\"Robb used a random chant. He didn\u2019t even know if it was accurate. Anyway, the mayor couldn\u2019t hear him, and with the sound of *Biu*, an ice arrow flew out of his fingertips and right into the jar. The jar and the apple juice inside instantly turned into ice.Mayor: \u201cHuh? How can father use ice magic?\u201dRobb said, \u201cWell, I know a thing or two. Though I\u2019m not that good at it. I only know the basics, like the ice arrow. Well, I used it for the first time and didn\u2019t really master the spell that well, so the whole jar froze. This is embarrassing...\u201dThe mayor was also confused and embarrassed, \"then we'll have to wait for it to slowly melt.\"Fortunately, it was late July, and the temperature was high. The jar melted after a few minutes of bathing in the hot sun. Robb picked up a cup poured with the apple juice and took a sip, saying happily, \"The cold is truly great. I feel like I\u2019m finally back in my hometown, drinking. Lillian, try it.\u201dLillian drank nicely and poured the mayor a glass of cold apple juice using a \"Guest\" cup.The three of them each held and drank cold apple juice.At this time, Robb felt homesick. After drinking a cold drink, he suddenly missed his original world. Ice, I really want to drink ice!Is it possible to recreate coke in this world?He put his hand on his chin and began to think deeply.It\u2019s almost impossible to make a complete replica. The recipe of Coca-Cola and Pepsi are top secrets, so he doesn\u2019t know it. Even if he does, if he can\u2019t gather the ingredients, then it\u2019s all for naught. Not to mention, he can\u2019t make a fortune here in this generation.It seems I've no choice but to make a carbonated apple-flavored drink.Carbonated drinks made in modern times are done by pressuring edible carbon dioxide gas into the water using a *carbonator\u201d.However, he can\u2019t get such an advanced machine in this world!He used his brain, and an answer soon came up. Doesn't a carbonator use strong pressure to force carbon dioxide into the water?Strong pressure can be made with magic.However, this requires advanced magic, which is beyond the grasp of ordinary magicians. It's fine to use something like an ice arrow before the mayor, but if I perform something that can manipulate gravity and exert pressure, I'll have some unnecessary trouble.So, he smiled and said, \u201cMr. Mayor, please wait here. I\u2019ll go outside and improve this juice. I\u2019ll take it out later and have you taste it.\u2019The mayor said, \u201cAlright!\u201dRobb took the apple juice jar into the warehouse and asked Lillian to prepare a few small bottles for later. He first activated the spell \"Water Control\". With that, the apple juice flew out of the jar, and with his control, it floated mid-air.Then, using fire magic, he instantly burned all the oxygen next to the floating oxygen and turned it into carbon dioxide. Afterward, he used the natural magic \u2013 gravity!Gravity is the ability to create a field with huge pressure. It\u2019s usually used to crush enemies, but he\u2019s using it to make carbonated water. The magician who first used the magic is probably crying.Huge pressure was exerted in all directions and pointed towards the center, trapping the carbon dioxide. Afterward, it was sucked into the apple juice, dissolving it and saturating the drink. Robb put the result into an empty bottle nearby and sealed it with a cork.Carbonated Apple-flavored drink, produced successfully!Robb excitedly picked up the bottle, and uncorked it. The sweet sound of \"zizi\u201d appeared, the sound of opened carbonated drinks. Coke, 7-Up, Sprite, and Mountain Dew all come to mind. This brings me back home. I really miss home, I don\u2019t want to go back, but it doesn\u2019t hurt to reminisce.Putting the jar to his mouth, he raised his neck, gurgled, and drank up half the jar instantly. The refreshing sensation of carbonated drinks rushed along his throat and into his stomach.Wah, this is the taste of summer.[Robb acquired Coca-Cola]A few minutes later, Robb returned to the yard with a bottle. The mayor waited patiently, and when he saw Robb come out, he hurriedly asked, \u201cFather, what do you have there?\u201d\u201cHave a taste of this!\u201d Robb handed over the bottle in his hand.The mayor curiously took the bottle and uncorked it. The sound made him feel very strange, and at the same time, he was a little afraid, \"Father, what kind of strange water is this? Why does it make such a sound?\"Robb put on a serious face, \"This water is called Coca-Cola, which I have hidden for many years. I have added the apple juice you just gave me, and it has been chilled. Therefore, its exact scientific name should be 'Chilled Apple-Flavored Coca-Cola\u2019. Take a sip first, and let\u2019s talk after.\"If another inexplicable person handed him a bottle of such liquid, the mayor would never drink it. He was afraid of poison. However, a priest of the Church of Light, a benevolent priest, asked him to drink, so he did not hesitate to pick up the jar and take a big sip. For a moment, the feeling of carbon dioxide in his nose almost made the mayor out of breath, but the comfort came at the same time, down his throat and seeped into his bones.*Hiccup*After a hiccup, the mayor shouted, \"Delicious, too delicious, this Apple-Flavored Coca-Cola is really amazing, great. It's the first time I've drunk something so good.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

How about we have a little discussion?\u201dThe mayor listened attentively and said, \u201cWhat discussion?\u201dRobb smiled and said, \"I'll help you make this type of drink. But you'll have to provide me with apple, grape, and other fruit juice. We can make different flavors of Coca-Cola. What do you think?\"The mayor nodded without hesitation, \u201cOf course! It\u2019s July, and all kinds of fruits will be picked. I\u2019ll get you all sorts of fruit juices. Ha, I\u2019ll save it and drink it slowly for a year.\u201dThe mayor left happily, and after a while, his servants brought in dozens of large buckets, which occupied half of Robb's warehouse, each filled with juice. Because Westwind Town is located at the foot of the Black Pine Mountains, next to the dense mountain forest, all kinds of fruit are produced, so the mayor got a lot.The servant chief who brought the juice respectfully said to Robb, \"the master said that there are still many fruits on the mountain that they haven\u2019t picked. Since Father can use them, he\u2019ll send someone to pick them all and get more juice.\"Robb said with a smile: \"Alright, go back first. Come back at noon tomorrow. I will give half of the produced Coca-Cola to the mayor.\u201dThe servants left.After they left, Robb made dozens of buckets of Coca-Cola. In fact, it was quite boring to do the same thing repeatedly, but for him, doing this was a very new thing. It was a piece of cake to do. It's really too easy compared to acting like the pope.That evening, at dinner, Lillian placed two plates of steak and two slices of bread on the stone table. She witnesses a rare sight of Robb standing. He stood up and threw two magic, chilled cups of Coca-Cola.In the afterglow of the setting sun, he raised his cup and told Lillian, \u201cCome! Cheers!\u201d\u201cMaster seems to be in a good mood today.\u201d Lillian couldn\u2019t help but mutter. \u201cThough this Coca-Cola is delicious, there is no need to be so happy.\u201dRobb smiled and said, \"You don't understand. I'm not happy because of the drink. I'm glad this place has come to resemble my hometown a bit more. Maybe one day, I can make this place like my hometown.\"\u201cIf you miss your hometown so much, why not return?\u201d Lillian asked curiously. \u201cI want to follow and see what kind of place master used to live in.\u201d\"I can't go back. I don't really want to go back either.\" Robb looked up at sunset and said leisurely, \"Though I miss my mom a little, she'll surely support me if she knew I was living such a happy life.\"At noon the next day, the mayor\u2019s servants came and took half of the Coca-Cola.In the afternoon, several rich people from the town also came and brought a lot of juice. The town's too small to keep secrets. After the mayor brought back Coca-Cola, the rich people immediately caught on and ran to the mayor to take a taste.It soon became the norm to trade two buckets of juice for a bucket of Coca-Cola. The wealthy tenants who came later didn't even talk bull; they just gave the fruit juice and left with the Coca-Cola.July passed quickly, and August came in a blink of an eye.That morning, Robb had just gotten up and was lazy in the yard when he saw the townspeople passing by at the yard gate, which he had not paid much attention to.He saw three or five townsmen pass by, all heading towards the center of town.Curiosity sprang up, and I couldn't help but ask a townsman, \"Why are all of you going to the town center?\"\"Father!\" The townsman respectfully said, \"Today is the day when the traveling merchant comes to Westwind Town.\"\u201cTravelling merchant? Is he the guy who sold me Lillian?\u201d Robb asked.\"Oh, not that one.\" The townsman replied respectfully, \"The merchant who sold her to you is a wealthy one. He usually comes to Westwind Town every three months to half a year and does high-end business. Generally speaking, he comes to a remote town like Westwind Town only to buy rare things or to buy the daughters of poor families, not to sell things to poor people. We can't afford what he sells. And when he comes to Westwind, we won't go to the center of town.\"Robb understood, \"That is to say, if you are all walking to the center of town, it means that this time you are going to a lower-end merchant?\"The townsman nodded respectfully and said, \"Yes, the traveling merchant is a merchant in the daily necessities department. He comes to Westwind Town every two months to bring us salt, seasoning, and cloth. Anyway, what he brought were necessities that Westwind Town couldn't produce, so every time he came, we would flock to the center of town and buy things from him. \" At this point, he looked embarrassed and continued, \"I usually work hard, but almost all the money I earn will end up in the hands of the traveling merchant!\"Robb smiled, \u201cThat\u2019s interesting.\u201d\u201cMy father, aren\u2019t you going to have a look?\u201d The townsman whispered, \"many of the things he sells can't be bought in the town. You may need them. If you are free, you might as well go and have a look.\"Robb thought about it carefully, whether he should or shouldn\u2019t take a look. Although he didn't know if he needed anything, he might find something interesting. Anyway, it's just shopping, not a mission.He shouted, \"Lillian, grab a shopping basket. Let's go shopping.\"Lillian ran over with a smile, smiling like a flower, \"Ah, when my parents were still around, I liked shopping with them. There were always a lot of good things from big cities.\"Seeing her lovely smiling face, Robb was also happy, \"Then, every time the traveling merchant comes, let's go shopping.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The master and servant walked leisurely to the center of town.When he first arrived, it was still early July, but now, it's early August. This is the second time Robb's been out shopping, mainly because he'd been so lazy this past month.This time he went out, he realized that Westwind Town looked quite different since the last time he went out shopping. Many families seem to be building water towers with water screws everywhere. It is amazing. Iron and copper pipes hang from the water towers.Since mining is the best of the four major industries in Westwind town, even the poorest of townspeople in Westwind Town, even the poorest of people could easily acquire iron and copper. Some people copy Robb and use iron, but some senior townspeople who deal with metal choose copper pipes instead.When Robb saw the iron pipes, he remembered, \"Since there is copper, I shouldn't use iron as a pipe. Copper won't oxidize, nor will it rust easily, which is a huge improvement compared to iron pipes. Alas, I thought like a modern person would. In my original world, the motherland was short of copper. It wasn't even enough to make copper money, so people used iron to make all kinds of objects instead. However, copper doesn't seem rare in this world, and it's not difficult for these people to use it for pipes.\"Robb turned to Lillian and said, \"Remind me when we get home that I have to ask the blacksmith again to replace all the water pipes in the chapel with copper.\"Lillian nodded, \u201cYes, master.\u201dAs they walked, the townspeople they passed by respectfully saluted Robb. From time to time, people would shout, \"Good morning, my father.\" Robb waved to everyone with the aura of a leader.When they arrived at the town center, Robb saw a gathering of people. He thought they were just blocking his view, but then he heard a townsman shouting, \"Father is coming!\"The townspeople who gathered around seemed to have been split by force capable of splitting open Mt. Hua. They separated from each other to make way for Robb, and they saluted, \"Father, after you.\"Robb felt embarrassed by their actions and said with a smile, \"You guys are too kind.\"The townspeople said respectfully, \u201cOf course!\u201dWell, it\u2019s okay for a son to be polite to his father, but can you sell things to your father for free? After a wave of complaints in his consciousness, Robb walked through the welcome array of the townspeople and came to see the \u201cTravelling merchant\u201d.He didn't notice at first, but it's a welcome sign to see that the traveling merchant's a dwarf. He's short, only as high as Robb's waist, with a big head accounting for 1/3 of his total height, with a beard dragging towards his waist. He stared at Robb with great interest.Behind the dwarf was a group of servants guarding the cart loaded with a dazzling array of goods. Robb glanced at bundles of linen, cotton, salt, pepper, vanilla jars, and some messy daily necessities. There were too many to enumerate.\u201cOh, dear father.\u201d The dwarf said, \u201cI come to Westwind Town every two months, but I didn\u2019t see a priest the last time I came. I didn\u2019t expect to see one now. You are so young and handsome.\u201dAs soon as they met, the dwarf immediately started flattering him. Sure enough, it\u2019s a merchant. Robb smiled and returned, \u201cI also think I\u2019m quite handsome in this character.\u201dThe dwarf said, \u201cCharacter?\u201dRobb smiled and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about the minor stuff. Let me look at the goods.\u201dThe dwarf hurriedly bowed and said, \u201cPlease choose as you will.\u201dRobb went to the cart and looked closely, immediately finding a roll of silk. The dwarf followed where his eyes went and quickly explained, \u201cFather, you understand. This is of high quality. It was shipped from Big Tang from the East. It\u2019s used to make light and comfortable clothes that aren\u2019t near comparable to cotton cloth. It\u2019s popular among princes and nobles.\u201dAt this point, he leaned close to Robb\u2019s ear and whispered, \u201cIt\u2019s especially suitable for making pajamas for women. Tsk, reach and touch it\u2026 that feeling, hehehe\u2026.\"Robb knows this, of course, and he also knows that robes made of silk are a lot better than cotton cloth, regardless of defense, intelligence, and magic power. This kind of thing, which can only be imported from Big Tang in the East, is very rare in the West, and it is not easy to buy it ordinarily.He smiled and said, \u201cGood, then I\u2019ll take it. How many do you have?\u201d\"I have ten!\" When the dwarf heard that Robb would buy it, a bright smile appeared, \u201cone gold per piece.\u201dRobb smiled and said, \u201cI\u2019ll take it all.\u201dCotton cloth only costs 10 silver, but silk costs ten times more. Of course, ordinary people can't buy it. In fact, it's quite difficult to sell this stuff on the western border. It's only occasionally bought by the mayor. Robb bought ten at once, which made the dwarf happy. He smiled, took the money from Lillian, and put it in his pocket. His servants put ten pieces of silk in Lillian's hand.Lillian couldn\u2019t carry all of them on her own, but there were enthusiastic townspeople who immediately came to help.Robb bought another big jar of salt, vanilla powder, and many things that could not be bought in Westwind Town, both useful and not-so-useful.However, after such an operation, Robb didn't have much money remaining. Last time, he made a hundred gold from selling the leather armor, which seemed to be a lot of money. However, he spent a lot of money on shopping and casually issued a mission with a request. With that, more than half of the money he had gone bye-bye at once.When his eyes turned to a large can of pepper on the dwarf merchant's cart, Lillian tugged at the corner of Robb's clothes and whispered, \"Master, don't. Don't buy pepper. You don't have much money left.\"\u201cOh, are we running out of money?\u201d Robb always left the money to Lillian, so he didn\u2019t know how much he had left.Lillian whispered, \u201cWe still have ten gold coins at home. It's okay to buy something, but... we can't buy any more pepper. It's too expensive, as expensive as gold. It takes a pound of gold to buy a pound of pepper. We'd better save a little bit now and stop buying such expensive things.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Without it, our limited recipes will have to be reduced again. I don't want it! Eating is a top priority, more important than conquering the world. If I want to eat rich and varied dishes, all kinds of seasonings are essential.\"\"Lillian said, \"No matter how important it is, you must be rich to buy it. If you don't have money, you'll only be able to eat potatoes.\"Let\u2019s make money. Robb walked behind a nearby house with a piece of silk. After a while, the silk turned into a silk robe emitting a blue aura. He went to the dwarf merchant and took it out. He smiled and asked, \u201cMr. Dwarf, are you interested in buying this robe?\u201d\"Wow!\" The dwarf merchant exclaimed, \"This is a really good robe. Ah, look, look at this workmanship. This is not ordinary. Coupled with this blue light, it has a very powerful enchantment. No mage or priest can resist this.\"Robb smiled and said, \u201cHow much are you going to pay for it?\u201d\"Ah! My apologies, but I don't dare to purchase this while it's great.\" The dwarf merchant awkwardly said, \"Your robe is at least worth more than a hundred gold, but as you can see, I'm just a small merchant selling daily goods. The biggest business I've done in the past two months is the ten pieces of silk you bought, which was only worth two or three gold coins. As for other commodities, such as salt and cotton, I can only earn a few copper and silver at a time. I don't dare buy goods worth a hundred gold coins at all. Otherwise, I'll go bankrupt if I can't sell them.\"Robb thought to himself, \u201cOh! Is that so?\u201dWell, it seems that although I can make great equipment, I might not be able to sell it.The real world isn't a game. The game has auctions, where players can easily buy your things. However, in the real world, sales channels limit your means of selling your goods.The robe he just made may be wanted by rich magicians, but where are these people? I can\u2019t find them.This is the current situation in the middle ages, buyers and sellers aren't connected, and the circulation of goods is extremely inconvenient.Of course, Robb can also fly to a big city with a flying spell and find a rich magician or a big merchant, and afterward, he can even use the knowledge to teleport back and forth conveniently (The game has a rule in which you can only teleport to cities you\u2019ve been to)However, that's not what a lazy person does! If he flies all over the world just to make some money, what's the difference between that and doing a \"delivery\" mission in the game?No matter how much money you earn that way, it can only be called hard-earned money, which doesn't line up with my spirit of laziness!Is there a way to make money lazily?Robb spread his hands and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s aspects are your favorite in terms of acquisition?\u201dThe dwarf smiled and said, \"Someone everyone can afford, needs, and is easy to carry. For example, pepper! It's necessary for making all kinds of delicious dishes. The price is high, profit is high, and it sells quickly. The rich people in every big town buy some of it, and it's easy to transport. If I buy it at a relatively low price and load it onto several big carts, it'll still be sold out easily. For example, you really want to buy, don't you?\"Robb was happy, \"I want to sell you something for pepper, but you say you want pepper? Are you kidding me? As far as I know, pepper isn't produced in the west, so it has to be shipped from the east, so it's more expensive than gold. Yet you say you want to buy here. That's bullshit.\"\u201cI don\u2019t dare!\u201d The dwarf merchant respectfully said, \u201cNo one dares to tease a priest. I\u2019m just saying what I want.\u201d\u201cFine, I know what I have to do now.\u201d Robb smiled and asked, \u201cHow long will you be in Westwind Town?\u201d\u201cFive days!\u201d The dwarf merchant smiled and said, \u201cI stay in each town for five days before leaving for the next.\u201d\u201cFive days? Great!\u201d Robb smiled and said, \u201cCome back after five days before you leave Westwind Town, come to my church, and get ready to buy pepper. I\u2019ll make you a lot of money.\u201dThe dwarf merchant respectfully replied, \u201cOkay, then I\u2019ll certainly come on time.\u201dRobb said, \"By the way, before you come. First, sell me a handful of pepper.\"\u201cHuh?\u201d The merchant suspected that he heard wrong, \u201cPriest, you say that you\u2019ll sell me pepper in five days. Why are you still buying pepper now? My purchase prices are much lower than the selling price, so if you buy now and sell it to me later, you\u2019ll lose a lot of money.\u201dRobb smiled and said, \u201cIt\u2019s in my personality to give money. It\u2019s called relieving creatures from suffering.\u201dLillian felt embarrassed beside him. Her master really liked throwing money around. Since she took charge of their accounts, she found out that her master's really fussy about his meals. He had to eat meat at every meal, and she had to eat the same as his servant. The clothes he wears are also fastidious. Several sets of clothes are worn accordingly, all in different styles, forcing her, his servant, to change clothes as well.Moreover, her owner was super lazy and didn't bother to do anything himself. He had to take the money to ask someone to pick the fruit that he could pick with only a few steps up the mountain, and he had to pay to hire a townsman to do it when he went out and went around the town.He also has this strange habit of asking people to do things by posting a piece of cloth in the town with the name: \"Quest Board.\" According to himself, this is very funny, saying that it is the adventurer turns to host, anyway, it\u2019s a lot of nonsense that I don't understand.Now her master's playing again. He actually wants to buy and sell pepper to the merchant in five days. Is this a distortion of human nature or a loss of human morality?Lillian quickly held Robb\u2019s sleeve and said hurriedly, \u201cMaster, what on Earth are you going to do? We really don\u2019t have much money.\u201dRobbs smiled and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, your master just remembered that in the game, there was a minigame, Black Blade Happy Farm, hahaha!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although, as a servant, she shouldn't be upset with her master, her situation as a servant with master was different from ordinary master-servant relationships. Robb was very kind to Lillian. After being together for more than a month, Lillian gradually became different from that of a normal servant.She and Robb became closer, smiling, with occasional coquettish emotions, showing Robb expressions that ordinarily aren't seen on the faces of ordinary servants. Sometimes she's clingy, occasionally shy. In short, she's completely different from when she only said \"Yes, master\" when Robb just bought her.Such is the case now. She frowned to show her master her dissatisfaction.If she had a different master, she\u2019d have broken her leg now, but instead of being angry, Robb thought it was cute and said, \u201cLillian, are you mad at master?\u201d\"No!\" Lillian said no, but her mouth was still frowning. After a few seconds, she added, \"our family doesn't have much money. Yet you still buy so much pepper, and we have to sell it to the merchant at a low price five days later. Lillian doesn't understand what master is planning.\"Robb smiled and said, \"I'm going to take these peppers back and plant them! Haven't you already converted the field? I will use it to grow pepper, so I bought some pepper from the merchant first. It's the seed itself. If it's planned and you pour water on it, a new pepper will grow. Then, we'll have a large amount of pepper. We'd make a fortune if we sell it to the merchant.\"Lillian said with tears and laughter, \"Master, that is obviously what someone who has never planted would say. How can you reap a harvest in a mere five days? Not to mention, pepper isn't suitable to grow in our place, especially regarding temperature, humidity, climate, and season.\"Robb said, \u201cWhen did Happy Farm ever say anything about climate, season, temperature, and humidity? All you have to do is water it. Besides, five days is too long. If you want players to have a great experience, then it\u2019s common sense to plant and harvest in a day.Lillian was bewildered, \u201cWhat the heck?\u201d\"Well, in short, just follow.\"The master and servant pair returned to the yard. Robb went to the field in the yard. It wasn't that large, just the typical private farm field. When the mayor handed over the chapel to Robb, the land was dry and deserted. But since Lillian came, the land's been turning well, saving it for growing some sweet potatoes, so it's now flat and soil soft with the weeds pulled out. It's beautiful now.Robb took out a handful of peppers he had just bought, picked one out of the many, and planted it.Lillian felt distressed seeing her master\u2019s \u201cwasteful\u201d action. But she held back because she didn\u2019t dare doubt her master. Oh, but she also stood up and said, \u201cMaster, let me sow the seeds. I\u2019m good at growing crops.\u201d\u201cNo!\u201d Robb shook his head solemnly, \u201cI have to do it myself.\u201d\u201cHuh? Why? How can a noble like you do this?\u201dRobb said, \"because I can distort the laws of the world, only the seeds I plant sprout quickly. You can't plant them.\"Lillian didn't understand the part \"Distort the laws of the world\" at all. But she knew her master's a great person and was right to listen.\"She saw that her master sowed the pepper seeds in intervals, and in a blink of an eye, the handful of pepper he bought were all planted.Then Robb looked back and smiled at Lillian and said, \"go and get me a little kettle.\"Lillian wanted to say, \"I'll water it,\" but when she saw that her usually lazy master decided to do it himself, she knew there was no room for negotiation. She obediently drew a pot of water, and Robb watered every pepper seed. Then he went back to his stone stool and sat down: \"Oh, I'm so tired of growing crops.\"Lillian couldn't help complaining, \"Master, how are you already tired? You didn't even fertilize it, so, strangely, you think it'll grow. Please don't shout that you're tired of farming after omitting such a vital step.\"\u201cThe steps I took were absolutely perfect. I didn\u2019t omit anything at all. Anyway, we\u2019ll see tomorrow.\u201dHow could Lillian sleep that night? Thinking that her master had wasted the price of gold pepper, she couldn\u2019t sleep. As soon as it was dawn, she jumped out of bed and ran into the yard.There was a faint golden light in the morning light. Lillian stood at the chapel's door and looked at the pepper field in the yard. She was startled. She saw a large patch of pepper trees growing in the field, obviously close to maturity and taller than Lillian, with a lot of green peppers on it.\u201cHuh, huh, huh?\u201d Lillian was surprised, \u201cMaster, get up, pepper, pepper, they grow overnight!\u201dRobb came out of his room in his pajamas, yawning, and said vaguely, \"Shouldn\u2019t this be taken advantage of?\" Happy Farm to grow vegetables, 24 hours a harvest; why make such a fuss! There are still a few hours to go. These peppers are not yet ripe. You can keep an eye on the time. As soon as I planted them yesterday, I hastened to cut them all so no one else would steal them.\"Lillian said, \u201cWho dares steal from the church? Aren\u2019t they afraid of getting damned? Oh no, I almost missed the point! The point is, why does the pepper grow this much after only a day?\u201d\u201cI told you I can distort the laws of the world, \u201cRobb smiled and continued, \u201cDon't worry about it; just get the bottles and cans ready. It\u2019s almost time to collect the pepper. It may be a little difficult for you to harvest it by yourself. Take some money to hire a few townspeople to help with the harvest, cut it all, pull out the roots and throw them away, and relevel the field as quickly as possible. I have to plant a second round. In five days, we can plant five rounds of action quickly. Hey! \"Lillian was only stupefied for a moment, \"Yes, master!\"After a while, the townspeople who Lillian paid to help with the harvest arrived, and when they saw such a beautiful patch of pepper growing in the chapel yard, their mouths widened agape and couldn\u2019t close for a while. Afterward, the miracle of the church in Westwind town spread so quickly that everyone said that the God of Light threw miracles in the world and made the plants planted in the chapel blossom and bear fruit overnight. This is the love of God, and the commendation Father Robb deserves for his pious sermons\u2026The townspeople then knelt outside the chapel and worshipped the private land.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They can only be harvested once. Pepper can be picked every year. These pepper trees have finally grown to such an extent that it's a pity to remove them so early.\"\u201cYes.\u201d Another townsman said, \u201cAs long as it\u2019s kept alive, it will bear a lot of pepper the following year, which can sell for a lot of money.\u201d\u201cA year is too long. Pepper trees that don\u2019t grow pepper in a day are not good trees,\u201d Robb said, \u201cTake them out.\u201dTownspeople, \u201c\u2026\u201dThere is no reason to talk to such an insane priest. A townsman bravely requested, \u201cFather, can I make a request? Since you\u2019re going to pull them out and throw them away anyways, you might as well give me some. I\u2019ll move them back to my own field. Even if the temperature and humidity aren\u2019t suitable, I should be able to get a harvest next year with proper care.\u201dAnother townsman also shouted, \u201cI want some, too! I want some, too!\u201dThe townspeople who came to help also shouted, \"I want some pepper, too!\"Robb smiled, \"Okay, whoever wants, just get it! But do it quickly, don\u2019t stop me from sowing another batch of seeds.\u201dAs soon as he said this, the entire field of pepper trees was dug up by the townspeople in the twinkling of an eye. They picked up the pepper from the tree, put it in a bag, and gave it to Lillian. Then they picked up the pepper tree and left fast. Instantly, they ran home and planted the pepper tree in the best place at home, ready to take good care of it and wait for tomorrow's harvest.Pepper is more precious than gold. As long as you have a tree that can produce pepper, it can easily make a town rich.If it was the usual Lillian, she'd certainly be distressed that her grown crops are being taken by others, but now, she's holding several large bags of freshly picked pepper. Her face is so confused that she doesn't even know what's happening.After the field was cleared out, the townspeople leveled it again, and then, as Robb looked at the time, he grabbed a handful of freshly picked peppers and sowed them into the field. He picked up a small kettle and watered each pepper. Then, he lazily sat on his favorite stone stool.Lillian said in a trembling voice, \u201cMaster, you didn\u2019t ask me to help you sow and water the pepper. Does this mean that this batch will be harvested in a day?\u201d\u201cWow, my Lillian is so smart. She already understands.\u201d Robb clapped and said, \u201cFrom now on, all crops I plant will only take a day to harvest.\u201d\"Wow, master's amazing. Our family will make a fortune if you plant a batch every day.\"\u201cNo way! I only move when the four basic needs: food, water, clothing, and shelter can\u2019t be met. Usually, I\u2019m too lazy to do it. Meeting my need for laziness with minimal action is my way of life.\u201d\u201cMaster, the nun said that what you\u2019re doing is wrong. Sloth is one of the seven deadly sins. It\u2019s not good for you to do so.\u201d\"Don't listen to that nun's nonsense. I'll tell you. She has already fallen 10% into laziness after staying in our house for a day. When she returns from finding the necromancer and stays with us for a few more days, she will become even lazier than I am. You'll see.\"In a blink of an eye, five days passed.It\u2019s the traveling merchant\u2019s last day in Westwind Town. He has made much money in Westwind Town over the past five days. This batch of cloth, salt, spices, peppers, and other things have already been sold. Almost all of the savings that the residents of Westwind Town painstakingly saved have fallen into the pockets of the traveling merchant.Having made his harvest, the dwarf couldn\u2019t help but smile.An armed servant leaned over from behind and whispered, \u201cMaster, we have an appointment to buy pepper from the priest today.\u201d\"Oh, right!\" The dwarf merchant laughed and said, \"This is the last thing we'll do in Westwind Town today. Let's go and visit the priest. Although we don't know what he's planning, we shouldn't offend a priest of the Church of Light; otherwise, he'll move the entire world for us. Even if he can only cough up ten pitiful peppers, we must hold back and not laugh. We must maintain reverence, pretend to admire, and praise him with the strength to save him face.\"The servant shrugged, smiling.The dwarf merchant walked in front, armed servants walking behind to protect him through the town.A servant suddenly pointed at a garden of a random town house and shouted, \u201cMaster, look\u2026 isn\u2019t that a pepper tree? And it\u2019s a mature one at that, taller than some people.\u201d\"Huh?\" The dwarf merchant rubbed his eyes and said, \"It's really a pepper tree. Hell, doesn't this only thrive in the far east? Since when can you find such a good pepper tree in Westwind Town?\"\u201cThis is strange, master. You see\u2026 there are also some in other houses.\u201d Cried the armed servant.The dwarf looked at where the servant was pointing; sure enough, several pepper trees were planted in front of him, all taller than a person. It was the kind of tree that could be harvested for a lot of pepper when it comes the time to harvest.\u201cMaster, this house has one, too!\u201d\u201cOh, my God, here too!\u201d\u201cThis is impossible. There\u2019s one in this family\u2019s, too!\u201d\u201cWhat the heck?\u201d The dwarf almost jumped and said, \u201cI came to this stupid Westwind Town every two months, and I've never seen such pepper trees here before. But all of a sudden, there are pepper trees everywhere. What on earth happened?\"He knocked on the door of a townsman. As soon as the townsman came out, the dwarf impatiently asked, \"Why are there so many pepper trees in your town suddenly?\"The townsman smiled and said, \"The priest gave it to us. The God of Light gave us a miracle that the pepper plant in the chapel could be harvested in a day. After he harvested the pepper, he gave us the tree. Many farmers have moved a few of them home to plant them. Next year, Westwind Town will be full of pepper, and everyone will be rich.\"Dwarf Merchant, \u201c\u2026\u201dHe began to feel something wrong. He hurriedly took his men and rushed to the chapel as soon as possible. There, he could see Robb sitting on a stone stool, watching a group of townspeople help him harvest peppers. Every time they harvested the peppers from each tree, the townspeople dig up the entire tree together with the soil. Then, they picked it up and ran back home.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They were as big as a bowl, and they were all filled with fresh peppers. The merchant's expression seemed restless as soon as the bag was put in front of the him.In his opinion, this is not pepper but gold!Robb picked up a piece of pepper and put it in his hand with a smile. \"try it and see if it tastes authentic.\"The dwarf merchant put the pepper into his mouth, and as soon as he bit it, the fragrant feeling immediately spread in his mouth, \"Ah, it's a great piece of pepper, and it tastes very mellow.\"Robb smiled, \"now you can buy from me as much as you want. I'd like to know how greedy you are for pepper and whether you can buy all my stock.\"The dwarf merchant glanced at the harvesting field next to him and thought, \u201cI should have no problem purchasing all the pepper produced in such a small private reserve. In any case, pepper is very easy to sell and is an indispensable seasoning for aristocrats and rich people at the dinner table. I can sell out no matter how much I charge, and of course, I earn more if I collect more.\u201dHe put on a serious face and said, \u201cFather, I want to buy all your peppers, all of them!\"\"Oh? All of them? Although the wholesale price is certainly much lower than the retail price, pepper is a very expensive commodity compared to gold,\" Robb then said, \u201cIf you're going to purchase all my pepper at wholesale price, I'm a little worried that you don't have that kind of money.\"The dwarf merchant said confidently, \"of course, I know it's expensive, but I can afford to buy pepper in a field that only encompasses such a small tract of land.\"\u201cAre you sure it\u2019s just a small tract of land?\u201d A strange smile bore on his face.The dwarf merchant has traveled north and south, dealing with countless people and doing business. He can tell something is wrong by looking at Robb's smile. Damn, why is the priest's smile so cheap? I feel like I'm stepping on a thunderbolt as if I'm going to be clouded away.Robb said, \"Lillian, go and get the pepper out of the warehouse... \" At this point, he suddenly said, \"Also, since you are delicate and soft, you can't carry such heavy things. I'll give you a BUFF before you go.\"He waved his hand, and as soon as he did, a golden light shone over Lillian, and in an instant, Lillian felt powerful.She couldn\u2019t help but wonder, \u201cMaster, what did you add to me?\u201d\u201cBUFF!\u201d\u201cBafu (\u62d4\u6d6e b\u00e1 f\u00fa)? What on earth is that?\u201d\u201cWell, the exact name is \u2018Blessing of the King\u2019. You\u2019ll understand once you start moving things.\u201dLillian said, \"Oh,\" and dashed into the warehouse. After a while, she came out with a super-large pocket in her hand, which was bigger than an ordinary person and looked heavy, but she carried it with one hand. She ran to the table, laughed, and said, \"Master, the way you have floated me is so strong that I can carry such a heavy pepper bag.\"The dwarf merchant swallowed a mouthful of spit and said, \"You mean\u2026 this bag is full of pepper?\"\"Yes!\" Lillian opened the bag and smiled, \"see for yourself.\"\u201cHey? Huh?\u201d The dwarf merchant sweated profusely and said, \u201cThis bag of pepper is probably worth hundreds of gold. I\u2026I\u2026\u201dKnowing that he wanted to say he couldn't afford it, Robb, the bad guy, deliberately said, \"Wow!\" Are you trying to say that the portion is too small? It doesn't matter. I still have several bags in the warehouse. If it's not enough, you can stay in Westwind Town for a few more days. It's not a problem for me to get you dozens of bags.\"The dwarf merchant sweated even more and said, \"No, stop! I can't do this anymore. I have no money. I have to throw in the towel. I only have enough money to buy one bag first, and when I return to my hometown and bring more money, I can buy a few more bags.\"Robb laughed as he intimidated his business partner. Of course, after having his fun, he stopped. He's not a person who deliberately annoys people either. If possible, Robb wanted to get along with all the good people in the world.\u201cLillian, pour Mr. Merchant a glass of pressured water.\u201d\"Yes, master!\" Lillian saw the look in Robb's eyes and knew he wasn't talking about ordinary water, so she ran back to the warehouse, picked up a jar, pulled out the cork, and Robb turned his hand while the dwarf merchant didn\u2019t notice. The ice that had just been made by ice magic had been sent straight into the jar.Lillian poured the dwarf merchant a glass of green, bubbling, and icy water and said with a smile, \"Mr. Merchant, please drink.\"The dwarf merchant could not understand what was in front of him. Fortunately, Robb was a priest, and the dwarf businessman, like the original mayor, would not suspect that the drink handed over by the priest was poisonous. He dared to take it and gently took a sip. The expression on his face became extremely euphoric in an instant.\"This is a wonderful drink, \"The dwarf merchant was in high spirits; my intuition in doing business for many years tells me that it will not be any harder to sell than pepper or even more popular than pepper. What on earth is this?\"\u201cIts name is Apple-flavored Coca-Cola. In fact, there\u2019s still grape and orange flavor. Do you want to buy some, too?\u201d\"You still have other flavors?\" The dwarf merchant was really convinced, and there was an obvious dilemma on his face. Obviously, he wanted pepper, but he also wanted Coca-Cola, but he had limited cash on hand, and he didn't know what to choose.Robb smiled and said, \"Well, let me give you some advice. Spend your money on pepper this time because you know more about pepper and must have regular customers. Sell it first. As for Coca-Cola, don't purchase in large quantities yet. I'll sell you a bucket at a low price. When you sell pepper to your big customers, take a glass and give them a taste. Then, tell them that it's tough to purchase it and that they'll have to first make a deposit before you bring it to them next time. In this way, people will always give you some deposits. If you take the deposit, they give, plus the money from pepper, come to me again. Won't it be easy to decide how much pepper and Coca-Cola you have to buy next time?\"\"Oh, that's a good plan.\" The dwarf merchant said with a smile, \"I didn't expect the priest to know how to do business.\"\"No, I don't understand\u2026 I don't understand as much as you do.\" Robb smiled, \"I just know some basic tricks, anyway. Let's make money together!\"The two clasped hands tightly. The dwarf merchant left with pepper and Coca-Cola with his dream of getting rich in the future.Robb slumped on the stone stool, waved to the merchant's not-so-tall figure, and whispered, \"The way to make money together is that I sit still, and you run around the world to make me money! Work hard, young man.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Unfortunately, silk stockings are not \"equipment that can be made by tailoring skills in the game,\" so Robb can't rub them out with his hands.So he let Lillian try to make a pair of stockings out of silk instead. Although she made the general structure, the silk stockings she made are inelastic and can\u2019t define a woman's legs beautifully and tightly like the silk stockings of modern times, so she had to give up.Virgo, people of Virgo, are always unhappy when something is imperfect.\"Oh!\" Robb rolled over on his stool. \"I feel like time has slowed.\"\u201cMaster, but I think time moves fast.\u201dRobb said angrily, \"when you feel happy, your time will move faster than others, and when you feel pain, your time will move slower than others.\"\"What master means\u2026 is\u2026 you\u2019re unhappy?\" Lillian was starled again, showing a worried expression, \"master has given me such a happy life, but you are not happy yourself. Lillian can\u2019t do this. Is there anything I can do for master?\"\"I want to see you wear silk stockings!\" Robb rolled off the stone stool and fell to the ground, then rolled all over the floor, acting like a child, \"I don't care. I\u2019ll make silk stockings no matter what.\"Lillian was startled when she saw that her master, who was usually too lazy to make noise like a maggot, dusty rolling on the ground, so she said, \"Don't worry, master. I'll ask Mr. Mayor to see if there is any elastic cloth that can be used to make silk stockings. Wait a minute. I'll go right away.\"Lillian ran out and returned after a while with a strange piece of white cloth in her hand, about the size of a palm. She went to Robb, who was too lazy to move on the floor and gently poked him with a finger. She whispered, \"Master, I'm back.\"\"Oh!\" Robb responded feebly.\"The mayor lent me a small piece of cloth, which is very flexible. Will you take a look at this?\"Robb turned over and sat up, taking the palm-sized white cloth from Lillian's hand, placing it in his hand, and gently felt it, \"Huh?\"The elasticity of this cloth is really good. As soon as Robb exerted some strength, he pulled it a bit. And after a while, he lets go, then he retracts again. Isn't this the perfect material for making silk stockings? He couldn't help being overjoyed and cheered up, \"are there any more? This is not enough to slap a big piece.\"Lillian said, \"the mayor said he had only a small piece and no more.\"\"Why is that all?\" Robb's newly rising joy instantly disappeared, \"well, where\u2019d it come from?\"Lillian replied, \"The mayor said that this is made of silk spit by the famous \u2018man-eating spider' in the depths of the Black Pine Mountains. It is a horrible spider with a human head. It lurks in the depths of a valley and weaves a web to catch all kinds of wild animals, humans, and even other monsters before eating them. This kind of spider spits silk with both toughness and elasticity, as is the case with the cloth used to make it. However, the spider lives in the depths of the mountains, so only a few adventurers go to trouble them. Not to mention, it must be brought back alive to force it to spin silk to weave cloth. So it's hard to get this kind of cloth. Maybe you can only find merchants to sell it to if you go to Bright Road or a big city like the Capital of Saints. We have to take this chance because there may not be any others.\"At this point, she paused and muttered, \"Mr. Mayor said that if master needs a lot of this kind of cloth, you can either try your luck in a big city, or you can issue a reward mission to invite adventurers into the mountains to catch man-eating spiders, and that it must be caught alive.\"Robb tilted his head and said, \"You can only buy it by chance in a big city, and adventurers don't necessarily succeed, right? Especially with adventurers like the helpless trio, there is almost no doubt that they will fail. Neither of these plans seems reliable.\"Lillian nodded.Rob jumped up with a swoosh, \"Well, it's decided. I'll go into the mountain to catch the spider myself.\"\u201cHuh? Lillian was shocked and said, \u201cMaster\u2026 going out\u2026 to the mountains yourself?\u201d\u201cYes! Why do you seem surprised?\u201d\u201cYou... Don\u2019t you keep saying that you just want to be lazy and stay still?\u201d\"Of course, I'm lazy about things I'm tired of playing with, but dressing up my maid is something I'm never tired of.\"The feeling others get when looking at Robb suddenly changed, from the lazy guy who seemed like a slug to one that seemed radiant and sparkling, a sign that the grinding emperor was about to return.In fact, he is a very diligent and persistent man compared to most people. Once he sets a goal, he will achieve it even if he has to manually repeat the action ten thousand times, but now, making a few silk stockings for his maid has become his new goal. A Virgo's spirit of never giving up until he achieves his goal burns in him again and restores his true character as the grinding emperor.\u201cI\u2019m going out to get some stuff to prepare.\u201d Robb then hurried into the warehouse and picked up a pile of ingredients. He rubbed, and afterward, food was made. After all, food is a primary need.He picked up a few more herbs and rubbed them together, and then a red and a blue antidote bottle were ready. Although his chance of injury and poisoning is near zero, no veteran player can go without meds.He picked up a piece of wild boar skin, rubbed it, and finished a set of leather armor and boots.Why choose leather? Because his level is too high and his stats are exceptional, there's nothing for him to be afraid of in this world, so he doesn't need to be equipped with high defense armor, so he only made a leather set with a useful enchantment called \"movement speed.\" Leather boots made with good ingredients can be enchanted with \"Movement Speed +30%\" at most.For a low-grade leather such as wild boar skin, its limit is only +10%, but as long as his boots, chest plate, leggings, hand guards, and helmet have +10% each, he can still gain a total of +50% movement speed. This attribute is widely used to explore mountains, so it's convenient.Of course, pure leather gear lacks appeal, so I must use a \u2018costume\u2019 addon.Robb picked up the set of T-shirt and jeans he was wearing when he first crossed over. This is not a simple pair of T-shirt and jeans, but a set of RMB equipment bought by Krypton gold. Its biggest perk is that it does not use up an equipment slot. Instead, it occupies an extra slot called \"exterior ornaments.\" Equipping this thing on top of it will cover up the appearance of your equipment and make you look like you\u2019re wearing a pair of T-shirt and jeans. It\u2019s especially used to cover ugly equipment.Robb put on the T-shirt and jeans, and the leather gear with movement speed enchants disappeared before long. He's now back to how he first looked when he initially came to this world, with his blonde hair, T-shirt, and jeans.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It's dangerous in the mountains. You\u2019ll surely die if you go in there alone. \"\"Don't worry, I'll be fine.\"Robb doesn't need to say much since Lillian is a very hardworking and capable little girl. In just a few days, she can already take care of herself.He walked to the cemetery behind the chapel, through which was near the hillside, and up the hillside, there were traces of the baron's small army that camped a few days ago.He walked up the hill, which was still close to the town. There are no monsters to be seen on the hillside yet. Instead, a townsman is chopping firewood here. When he saw Robb coming head-on, the townsman shouted in amazement, \"Father!\" What are you doing up the mountain? \"\"Why do you look so surprised?\" Robb smiled, \"I came to the mountains to find something.\"\"Ah!\" The townsman shouted, \u201cFather went out to the mountains, big news, I want to inform all the townspeople that motionless Father unexpectedly went up the mountain...\"While screaming strangely, the townsman rushed back to the town.Robb, \u201c\u2026\u201dThis is unreasonable; whatever. It's pointless to talk to these insignificant townspeople.Robb continued to walk; with his +50% movement speed bonus, it went even more smoothly. The town is very far now. He's already deep in the forest, and his surroundings are silent. Five or six goblins poked their heads from behind a big tree and looked at Robb at a distance. Goblins are timid when alone but courageous in groups. However, they are even more courageous when faced with a lone enemy. They're planning on beating Robb before killing and bringing him back to eat.Robb didn't bother involving himself with these trash monsters. After making sure that there were no townsmen around and that he won\u2019t be seen, he immediately launched a flying spell, whizzing straight into the blue sky.The goblins who were thinking about going at him were immediately scared to death. This human being knows how to fly. That's a top spell that even a great magician doesn't necessarily know. And they actually wanted to beat up Robb just now. Now, they feel scared when they think about it.Robb doesn't know where the man-eating spider is, but it doesn't matter. Lillian once said that the man-eating spider is in the depths of the Black Pine Mountains. Just one clue is enough. He flew to the deepest part of the mountains, where the mountain is high, and the forest is dense.The speed of flying is, of course, extremely fast. He flew over the distance he had to walk for several days in no more than three hours.The towering peaks and dense pine forests seem to be the depths of the Black Pine Mountains.Now that he had reached the place, Robb had to stop flying. With a thick canopy, he could hardly see the ground from the sky.He deactivated the flying spell and fell straight out of the sky, falling hundreds of meters high. A high ordinary people would undoubtedly fall to their deaths.But when Robb was about to land, he activated \u201cIce Box\u201d (Ice Barrier). When he landed, the ice immediately made a solid hole in the ground, and a few seconds later, the ice melted, and Robb came out unharmed.After shaking his hands and feet for a little, he took a deep breath.He walked forward for a while, breathing the fresh air from the forest, \"well, I haven't been out in a long time. It feels good to come out once in a while.\"When Robb finished saying this, he heard a gloomy voice behind him, \"I haven't seen a human in a long time. It feels good to eat a human once in a while.\"When he turned around, there was a harpy standing behind him.This is an indecent creature. Its lower body is that of an eagle, but its upper body is a woman\u2019s. It has a woman\u2019s face, large oppai, dangling right before his face. Ah, so the holy light that dangled on the screen was this.In fact, Robb felt quite tired of seeing Harpies in the game, but when he saw it in the real world, he felt that it was different. After all, the oppai on an LCD screen is completely different from reality.Robb rubbed his eyes and protested, \u201cCover up your oppai. It\u2019s not that appealing for a woman to show it so thoroughly when you first meet. Men still like obscure beauties. If it\u2019s only partially hidden, then it\u2019s a good oppai.\u201dThe eagle harpy suddenly stopped. The man was so calm even after he saw her, saying such strange words. Shouldn't you be scared and run away or retaliate? Yet he talked about how I'm dressed.It uttered shrill cry, waving its right-wing forward and firing a whirlwind towards Robb.This is not normal wind produced by force, but wind produced by magic. If the whirlwind hits, it\u2019ll cut a human body like a knife.However\u2026Robb\u2019s magic resistance is far beyond what the harpy can imagine.It was inevitable resisted!The whirl ward passed by Robb before disappearing.Robb, as if he didn't even notice it, said to the harpy, \"I'm looking for a man-eating spider. Do you know where it is? If you take me to find it, I will reward you with a bottle of Coca-Cola. After drinking it, I will make sure that your oppai will grow bigger. You see, when I went on a long trip, I only took one bottle for me, so I didn\u2019t prepare another for you. What a valuable and good thing it is. It's a good deal for you. \"Two whirlwinds crossed with a wave of its left and right wing.Resisted! Resisted!Robb said, \u201cNegotiate now while I\u2019m still willing. Don\u2019t force my hand.\u201dThe harpy cried angrily, flew high, and swooped down on Robb, its two claws stretched forward to scratch Robb.Miss!The next moment, Robb held it by the neck and picked it up like a sandbag, \"if you refuse to talk properly and use violence against me, there is nothing I can do about it.\"He threw the harpy to the ground, and the latter's back fell with a bang, making a big hole in the ground. The harpy felt that all its bones were torn apart by this blow. It was paralyzed to the ground and could not move anymore.Robb put one foot on her wing and asked, \"now that the Coca-Cola option is gone, only the questions I ask you remain. If you can't answer them, I will beat you to death. Answer, where are the man-eating spiders?\"The harpy trembled with fear. It now knows how powerful the person she is messing with is, \"in the North\u2026 North... It's in the valley to the North!\"\"Oh, that's right.\" Robb withdrew his feet, turned around, walked a few steps, and suddenly looked back, \"I remember the first thing you said. You seem to be a man-eating monster.\"The eagle harpy froze, petrified.Robb waved his hand, and a huge fireball flew from his fingers before burning the harpy to ashes.\"It's better to kill a man-eating monster, but sadly, it doesn't give experience.\" Robb sighed regretfully, \"if only the game had an update and increased the level limit from 200 and added two new classes, my experience in killing these monsters would not be wasted. Alas!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You can see a towering peak in front, which should be the highest mountain in the Black Pine Mountain Range. It looks very high with its peak covered with thick snow; from the mountainside, there is a dense green forest.To the south of the mountain is a steep cliff, below which is a deep valley.Seeing this valley, Robb's heart cheered. The eagle harpy said that the \" man-eating spider\" is in this valley. That is to say, Lillian's stockings are also in this valley; I'm happy!Stockings, I'm coming.Robb sped up. His speed was simply terrifying, moving several meters in a flash. A basilisk hiding was just about to attack Robb, but Robb had already run more than 10 meters away, frightening the basilisk to the point that it dared not move.It was not long before Robb came to the mouth of the valley and looked inside. It was full of rocks and trees. Even if detection was activated, it only had a range of 5000 yards, but it saw through trees and stones in its range.Robb was upset, \u201cWhy do man-eating spiders live in places like this?\u201dAfter complaining, he did understand that it is convenient to spin cobwebs in such a place. How can cobwebs be made in an open area?He stepped into the valley. And because of his combat prowess, he didn\u2019t have to tread carefully and dared to just keep moving forward.Doing it this way, however, made him prone to going in the wrong direction. But he didn't go far before a strange figure appeared behind a tree next to him. It moved quickly and cut Robb in the neck with a knife. However, after it missed, it stopped attacking.Robb turned around and saw a skeleton soldier looking at his knife with its empty eye socket, then at Robb's neck. There was no expression on the skeleton's face, but its actions made it seem cute and confused. It doesn't seem to understand how it was missed.He realized that t wasn't being controlled by control skeleton, but acted of its own volition. That is to say, it's a true undead.\"Yo! This is the first time I've seen the undead. \" Robb waved to the skeleton soldier. \"Dude, are you from this valley? Have you seen any man-eating spiders? Show me the way.\"The skeleton indicated that it didn't want to talk to Robb and waved its knife at him.Robb kicked it right on the waist, knocking it to some sort of wall.He thought it would hit the edge of the mountain and turn into a pile of broken bones, which was also the purpose of Robb's kick. Still, unexpectedly, after flying back a few meters, the skeleton soldier suddenly froze mid-air and stopped moving. Then, it sloshed twice and finally suspended mid-air, making a strange \"\u5927\" shape.\"Huh?\" Robb could not help but freeze, \"what the hell?\"However, two seconds later, Robb realized that the skeleton soldier was not suspended in mid-air by its own strength but was caught by an invisible web. It turned out that there was a huge, transparent net on the mountain in front of him. After the skeleton soldier was knocked over, it hung on the web and was stuck.As soon as he thought of this, he saw a head appear from a hole near the edge of the mountain. It was the head of a beautiful woman with beautiful features, silky eyes, and red lips.However, below the head of this beautiful woman is its ugly spider body, the kind that can instantly scare a man into impotence.It was obviously attracted by the vibration of its web, so it poked its head and a small part of its body out of the hole, glanced at the prey in the web from a distance, and felt disappointed that it caught a skeleton soldier, which had no blood or flesh and could not be eaten!It gently scratched its leg on a strand of spider silk at the mouth of the hole, and the whole web trembled, making the skeleton soldier fall off, and then it retreated into the hole with a swoosh and did not come out again.In fact, the entire sequence of actions took place in a matter of seconds before the cliff's edge was restored to what it had been like before, instantly and quietly. With such a large transparent net hanging in mid-air, no one knew that a man-eating spider was hidden in a hole next to it.Robb was delighted and said, \u201cInteresting! There's nothing like that in the game I played, which makes it a very interesting creature.\"Robb reached into the hole and pulled out nothing. The spider hiding in the hole's depths did not seem to come out to bite his hand, making it impossible for him to complete the task of \"fishing for spiders\" with his hands.Robb doesn't want to go into the hole to catch it! Normal humans don't like to go into holes where you can barely move in.\u201cThis is troublesome. It seems that this monster\u2019s very vigilant. It\u2019s the type that won\u2019t leave its hole unless it has something in its web.\u201dThere\u2019s only one way to lure it out alive.Using my body as bait!Robb walked up to the transparent web, and shrugged before kicking the ground for momentum. He flew and crashed into the spider web.\u201cResisted!\u201d\"Resisted!\"\u201cResisted!\u201dEvery contact he had with the web produced 'Resisted'. The power of the spider is obviously not enough to threaten Robb.Robb secretly scolded in his heart, \u201cDamn it! Why can\u2019t I use my body as bait? Now I have to do something else.\u201dHe stretched his hands, grabbed a few thick filaments of the web, and deliberately kicked the cross-sections of the web before shaking them hard. The whole web shook violently with his movements.Also, since the spider has a human head, it may be able to understand human language, so he acted like he was caught successfully.Robb simply shouted at the top of his lungs, \u201cHelp! I\u2019m caught in a web. Somebody help!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A mere spider with an IQ of less than 5 will surely be fooled.He wobbled and struggled and screamed for help, showing incisively and vividly what a man who was accidentally caught in a cobweb should look like.Soon, there was a movement at the mouth of the spider hole, and the first one sticking out of the hole was a spider's foot, which was placed on a strand of thick silk at the mouth of the hole, through which the vibration of the cobweb was felt.Then, it was convinced that its cobweb had reached its prey.The spider's head came out a little bit, seemingly careful and vigilant.The depths of the Black Pine Mountain Range houses all kinds of powerful monsters. If it's not careful, it will surely die a gory death.The spider, with its beautiful female head, glanced at Robb with a pair of beautiful eyes, watching warily to see if the prey was really managed by its own cobweb.It could see that the human being really fell into its trap!He was struggling desperately, but his hands and feet were entangled in its cobwebs, and he struggled feebly, which proved that he had completely lost his fighting ability. All it had to do was to climb over and inject venom into the human\u2019s body. It can paralyze him and then easily drag him into the hole and eat him.There was an evil smile on its beautiful face when it began to poke out of the hole slowly.Robb watched the spider coming out of the hole bit by bit, thinking to himself, \"here we come!\"A little more before your entire body is sticking out of the spider hole. When that happens, I\u2019ll come right over and buckle your neck.Then my maid will have excellent elastic stockings to wear, hehe\u2026Transparent spider silk, the woven cloth should also be transparent, dyed white is white silk, dyed black is black silk, not dyed is bare, oh shit, it\u2019s too cool.The head of the spider finally came out, and then its round spider belly, bit by bit, came out of the hole. While Robb slowly gathered his momentum, getting prepared to engage.However, just when Robb was about to charge, an arrow suddenly popped into the air with great power. And poof, right in the face of the man-eating spider. The beautiful female head was then immediately split in two by a big sword, and its whole body was cut in half by the blade.Green blood splattered everywhere, man-eating spider \u2013 Dead!Robb, \u201c\u2026\u201dFor Robb, what was cut in half was not the spider but the silk stockings of his lovely little maid. This merciless knife shattered the teenager's yearning and longing for a better life.I\u2019m Angry!Oh, I still have resurrection magic!Robb hastened to use resurrection on the spider's body, but it didn't work. The spider is designated as \"Evil,\" so rather than doing good to the creature, it has a lethal effect on it.Then, he quickly used \"Undead Resurrection\". As a result, the spider stood up but became a skeleton spider. Not to mention silk, it doesn't even have flex or blood.Robb scolded in his heart, \u201cMMP!\u201d (TL: My friends used this term before, they said it\u2019s \u2018Son of a Bitch\u2019)I have an MMP sentence that I have to say!Just then, behind a large stone In the distance, Baron Perseus jumped over and said with a look of fear, \"Oh, I heard someone calling for help, so I ran over quickly. I happened to see that the spider was going to attack a human being. Fortunately, at a critical moment, my sword caught up.\"Robb, \u201cDamn it!\u201d He quietly yet quickly used a holy spell on the skeleton spider, making it scatter all over the floor.Baron Perseus came out from behind the stone, saying, \"what are you doing in the depths of the Black Pine Mountain Range alone, young man? It\u2019s dangerous, isn't it? You were almost eaten by a spider. Huh?\"He saw Robb's face and was startled, \"Mr. Robb? You\u2026 What are you doing here?\"Robb didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry. It\u2019s an awkward situation.It turns out that Baron Perseus led Little Yi and the three adventurers here after several days of trudging and tracking, but Robb used a cheat skill to fly ahead of them in a matter of hours, which led to this very embarrassing situation.What am I supposed to do now?Yi, the three adventurers, and a large group of soldiers continued to emerge from behind the boulders in the distance, most of whom now looked at Robb with strange eyes. Only the three smiled because they knew that Robb was not simple and had a secret identity and that seeing Robb here was not as unexpected as it was for the Baron and Little Yi.Robb looked at the caring eyes of the Baron and Little Yi before looking at the man-eating spider and sighed. He can't blame the Baron. He killed the spider because he wanted to save Robb. It would be immature to lose his temper because others saved him.\u201cFather, why are you here?\u201d Little Yi, who he had not flirted with for several days, regained her aloof demeanor and spoke in a cold tone.Robb had to start bluffing, \"After you left, I was worried about your safety. I felt that I could not just let you go into the mountains to take risks like this. I should also contribute to the just cause, so I came to the mountains to find you. Then I walked and walked. I came here and was accidentally caught by a cobweb.\"The Baron could not help but feel moved, \"Father, I admire you for being so kind.\" A berserker's brain is really simple; he's too gullible.Little Yi is not as easy to fool, her cold face flashing doubt, \u201cYou entered the mountain alone? How were you able to walk into the depths of the Black Pine Mountain Range when the cursed ruby absorbed your strength? How were you not eaten by monsters along the way?\u201dWhy do you have to be so smart at a time like this? Robb vomited in his heart but said, \"You see, wasn't I almost eaten by a monster just now? This shows that I was just lucky so far, but my luck has finally run out.\"Little Yi felt something was wrong but didn't couldn't tell what it was, which made her feel very uncomfortable.\"Don't say that kind of stuff anymore,\" said the baron. \"Release the priest from the spider's web first. It's hard for him to hang there.\"Several soldiers rushed over and took out their knives to cut the spider silk. Unexpectedly, the spider silk was really tough. The soldiers couldn't cut it with their knives even after a long time had passed. Robb cried, \"Don't cut it randomly; just cut the edges of the spider web. Don't cut the middle. I want this silk. Save it for me!\u201dHearing him say this, the three adventurers seemed to understand something. After glancing at each other, Gorda strode up, waved his one-handed sword, and cut at the corners of the web. Robb \"fell\" from the center of the web, and when he landed, Robb pretended to fall, and Xuelu jumped forward and pretended to help him.Robb was helped by Xuelu and finally \"stood firmly.\" He patted his chest and looked frightened, \"That was close. I was almost eaten by a monster. Thanks for the help.\"Xuelu nudged him on his waist and whispered, \u201cMr. Robb, what are you playing at?\u201dRobb also whispered, \"I came into the mountain to catch the man-eating spider for its silk to make something. When I was about to catch a live one, I didn't expect the Baron to kill it. Tell me if it was justified or if I was wronged!\u201dXuelu laughed \"Pfft\" and quickly hid it, whispering, \"Don't worry, there's more than one spider. We'll catch it later.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He was smart enough not to give it directly to Robb but held it in his hand and hid it behind his back, and then when he came to say hello to Robb, pretended to shake hands with Robb and put the ball of spider silk in his hand.Robb took it, threw it into his bag, and it was settled.The two exchanged a tacit look. Robb patted Gorda on the shoulder and smiled, \"Thank you for removing me from the spider web.\"Golda knew that although he was saying this to the Baron and Little Yi, he thanked him for helping him collect the spider silk and said with a smile, \"You weren\u2019t afraid of danger and came into the mountains to help us. We should thank you instead.\"Robb turned himself into an \"eager to help\" person, so he had to go up to the Baron and Little Yi, \"Fortunately, I found you here, and I can make a contribution to the peace of the Kingdom of Gran.\"\u201cWelcome,\u201d said the Baron.Little Yi kept a cold face and did not speak, obviously still a little suspicious. This lazy guy? Help? It isn\u2019t right to think with your toes.Robb asked, \"Mr. Baron, how are you doing with your search? Do you have any clues to the evil necromancer?\u201d\u201cWe have!\u201d Speaking of this, the Baron looked very excited, \"thanks to Mr. Jike's tracking skills, we found the traces of dozens of stolen skeletons in Westwind Town when they entered the mountains, and we tracked them the entire. Although we went the wrong way twice, Mr. Jike found the path again and made us go the right route.\u201dLittle Yi said, \u201cWhen we explored the vicinity of this valley, we encountered skeleton scouts several times. It\u2019s obvious that someone sent scouts to guard the area around the valley and didn\u2019t want people to come near. There\u2019s obviously something going on in the depths of the valley.\u201dHearing them talk, Robb remembered that he had just kicked a skeleton soldier! No wonder I met them here. The spider I was looking for was in the same place as the necromancer.The Baron said, \u201cSister Ishir was the only holy person we had, so I was worried that the undead would be difficult for us to deal with. Now that we have Mr. Robb, we have two holy members. I'm more certain of dealing with the undead now.\"Robb said, \u201cAren\u2019t you here to scout? Why do you suddenly want to deal with it?\u201d\"If we can kill, why scout?\" said the Baron.Robb applauded, \u201cYou really are a qualified berserker.\u201d\"In short, we will explore every corner of the valley in detail.\" The Baron said, \"We\u2019ll find traces of the necromancer. If we can kill him, kill him decisively. If not, we\u2019ll look for its lair and head to inform the Great Duke to lead the White Lion Cavalry here.\"Robb thought, \u201cYou want to search carefully? Great! Find me some man-eating spiders while you\u2019re at it. It\u2019s easier with more people. I\u2019ll join you then.\u201dIt was already getting late, and the sun was about to set.After giving a general account of the situation, the Baron directed his soldiers to camp in a secluded place in the valley to start a fire and spend the night.Little Yi stayed outside the camp, dipping a pen with holy water and drawing some strange patterns on the ground. Robb doesn\u2019t recognize these patterns, but he can guess what Little Yi is doing. What she is drawing should be a holy magic array called \"Holy Light Sanctuary.\" Its effect is to prevent unclean things from entering the magic array.The word \"unclean\" includes many things, such as skeletons, zombies, vampires, ghosts, skeleton dragons, and man-eating spiders. In short, all undead and evil creatures will be seriously hurt if they encounter this array.But its weakness is obvious. You can't move while drawing it, and it takes a long time to draw this magic array. Depending on the size of the area you want to protect, it takes dozens of minutes to hours when it comes to defend a city. It could take even a group of priests months to finish drawing the array, and if a monster comes rushing over in the middle of it, it's over.Therefore, while this method looks powerful, there are not many places where it can be used in.Of course, Robb does not have this problem with this since his game, called \"Dark Blade,\" only needs 5 seconds to finish a \u201cHoly Light Sanctuary\u201d with a radius of 20 yards on the ground.While he was thinking about this question, Xiaoyi confessed to him: \"Father, it is too slow for me to draw the Holy Light Sanctuary alone. Can you help me draw the magic array on the other side of the camp?\"While he was thinking about this, Little Yi confessed, \"Father, it will take too long for me to draw the Holy Light Sanctuary alone. Can you help me draw the magic array on the other side of the camp? We each draw half and connect them in the middle.\u201dRobb spread his hand and said, \"Before I came, did you draw alone?\"Little Yi replied, \u201cYes!\u201d\"Then why are you only willing to draw half when I'm here?\" Robb said solemnly, \"You can't be lazy like this, laziness is one of the seven sins. Don't you feel ashamed as a nun of the Church of Light? You should continue to finish it alone. \"Little Yi, \u201c\u2026\u201dThis argument inevitably fails as Little Yi said with a cold face, \"You don't know how to draw Holy Light Sanctuary, do you?\"\"Look at who you're talking to. Me! A faithful believer of the God of Light. How could I not draw such a simple array like the Holy Light Sanctuary? I can draw it with my eyes closed.\"\u201cThen look at the part I\u2019m at now. What\u2019s the next stroke?\u201d Little Yi pointed at the magic array on the ground and looked at Robb with her cold eyes.Robb doesn't really know what the next stroke is. Like, who bothers looking at that stuff in the game?He spread his hand and said, \"It's too easy. I don't even need to explain.\"Little Yi, \u201cCut!\u201cWhat cut?\u201d\u201cAs you guessed.\u201d\"Well, it's time for me to show some real skills.\" Robb slapped his butt and stood up, \"I don't like drawing magic arrays in front of others. But if I want to draw, I'll draw a new one. And not just part of the array, but the entire thing.\"Little Yi looked at Robb and said nothing, but she obviously didn't believe it.In fact, since she met Robb, she has never seen Robb seriously use holy magic. In her opinion, the last time Robb did something, he became a Berserker. He hacked the double-headed ogre to death with the power of the cursed ruby, not his own.Of course, it felt a little suspicious later, but she didn't know what Robb could do.Robb is also tired of being picked on by this nun. Although laziness is important, men can't always accept being p***sies and making women feel better about themselves.He stood in front of Little Yi, took the pen, and said with a smile, \"in the far East, there is a drawing technique called ink splashing, which means you can draw just by throwing ink out. I learned this technique in the East. I found that it can be used not only to draw regular images but also to draw magic arrays. Do you believe me when I say that when I throw this holy water around me, I\u2019ll make the Holy Light Sanctuary?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Your nonsense has a limit. Although lying isn't one of the seven sins, the God of Light doesn't advocate it.\"\u201cI\u2019m not lying!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re exaggerating, which isn\u2019t much different.\u201dRobb said, \u201cLet\u2019s have a bet. I'll spill this, and the array will be formed; what do you say?\"\u201cI\u2019ll apologize to you.\u201d\u201cIf an apology is enough, then what\u2019s the point of judging heretics? Just let the heretics apologize, and it\u2019s over,\u201d Robb said.Little Yi, \u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d\"Common sense is to apologize by showing your chest\u2026 ahem\u2026.\" Robb forcibly took his sentence back. Forget it. Flirting should be kept in moderation.Although he's a little naughty at times, he never acts like a hooligan, \"Just do this instead then give me a shoulder massage. That shouldn't be too hard, right?\"\u201cOkay! But if you can\u2019t do it, please stop being lazy and practice harder.\u201dRobb could see that the nun didn't mean any harm from the request she asked for. She really just wanted me to improve. She is a good person, so I can\u2019t bully her much.\"Then, I'll begin.\" Robb held up the bottle of holy light high and began to use the sanctuary of light with a completion time of 5 seconds. He waited for it to finish before doing anything else.At this time, the nearby soldiers could not help but look over together. Several soldiers nearby heard the argument between Robb and Little Yi and knew what they were betting on, so they whispered to their comrades-in-arms. Even the Baron heard it. A large crowd of people crowded over and looked at this side curiously.Only the three adventurers stood in the distance, too lazy to join the party. Xuelu said with a low laugh, \"The nun is bringing embarrassment upon herself again.\u201dGolda shrugged. \"She doesn't know what kind of person she's dealing with, but luckily we do.\"Xuelu asked, \u201cWhy does this woman always pick on Mr. Robb?\u201dGorda, \u201cProbably something along the lines of a veteran adventurer reminding newbies, but more on who among the clergy of the Church of Light can make greater demands on each other.\u201dXuelu shrugged, \u201cMagicians mind their own business.\u201dGorda said, \u201cBut I like it!\u201dIn full view of the public, the moment his activation time was over and the skill was about to be released, he opened the holy water bottle and raised it to the sky with strength. The holy water in the bottle flew high, making a circle of droplets mid-air, flying in all directions.Everyone couldn't help but look up at the droplets in the air. When they fell, their eyes looked down, and their eyes sat on the ground.As soon as Robb looked up and bowed, there was already a golden magic array on the ground. So, as soon as the water droplets fell, the magic array was formed.In other words, from their point of view, this looks like it was painted with holy water.\u201cIt\u2019s the Holy Light Sanctuary!\u201d A soldier called out, and then more soldiers began to talk.\"It's exactly the same as the magic array drawn by the nun last night.\"\"Impressive! It really was just a splash before the Holy Light Sanctuary was completed. The nun painted for half an hour last night.\u201d\u201cThe range of this Holy Light Sanctuary is very wide, 20 yards, which is much larger than the one drawn by the nun yesterday.\u201d\"This is amazing.\"\"If you can draw the Holy Light Sanctuary at this speed, you can stand directly in front of a pile of monsters and punch their faces inside the array.\"\u201cAmazing!\u201dThe soldiers were amazed.Little Yi also opened her mouth wide and couldn't close it for a while, \"This\u2026 this\u2026 Isn't this too much? Can you really draw an array like this? Does it really have protective power?\"She quickly squatted down, stretched out a hand, put it on the magic array, and sensed it with her heart. She didn't know it yet but was startled when she felt it. This magic array contains a lot of holy magic, and its intensity is so high that it is much stronger than her own.The Baron applauded hard: \"interesting, very interesting, what do you call it, the ink splashing technique of the east? This is revolutionary. I have to report it to the Great Duke. If our White Lion Cavalry magicians can draw magic arrays at the same speed, no enemy can stop us.\"The Baron did not know that because of his words, the magicians of the White Lion Knights practiced \"Ink Splashing\" for more than two months. Of course, none of them succeeded, and all the magicians had no choice but to admit they had no talent.Robb smiled, \u201cIsn\u2019t the ink splashing technique of the east great? It took me a while to study in the east to understand it. Fortunately, easterners only use this technique to draw paintings, but not for magic arrays; otherwise, the west would\u2019ve been destroyed.\u201dXiao Yi nodded with difficulty, \"indeed, I heard that Big Tang did not do it for magic arrays. If they had painted magic arrays in this way, the magical kingdom, Gran, and Norma, the kingdom of knights, would have perished long ago.\"Robb said, \"well, now that I've drawn the magic array for you. Admit defeat and come massage my shoulders.\u201dLittle Yi, \u201c\u2026\u201dLittle Yi couldn't say anything to refute it. Robb sat on a big stone while Little Yi stood behind him with a straight face, stretching out her hands while kneading Robb's shoulders. A subtle silence bore between the two for a while.Robb felt a pair of soft little hands pinching and massaging his shoulders. Too comfortable.He closed his eyes to enjoy it.Little Yi thought Robb would open his mouth to ridicule her but did not expect him to be unexpectedly quiet, so she couldn\u2019t help whispering, \"I thought you would laugh at me for trying to go beyond my limits or scold me for being blind.\"Robb smiled, \u201cDo I look like someone who\u2019ll do that?\u201dWhen Yi thought about it, indeed, Robb is not that kind of person. Although Robb is very lazy and looks cheap when he says \"wow,\" he doesn't look like a guy who likes to say hurtful words. I don't want to know. But thinking about it carefully, nothing seems to be wrong with him.She couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cTo what extent did you practice your holy magic? The last time, we used restoration magic, but because I rushed to do it, you didn\u2019t have a chance to show yours at all. Only now did I realize that your holy magic is so great that it\u2019s far beyond my imagination.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

How strong can a little priest in this small place at the border be? I just learned ink splashing in the east, other holy magic are just average.\u201dIf Robb jumped up and pretended at this time, bragging about his strength, Little Yi would believe that he was a little priest in a small place at the border that picked something up to make him stronger.However, Robb did not show the appearance of frivolity. Instead, he had a calm attitude, speaking with some modesty and a faint sense of self-confidence.Little Yi is a person who grew up in a big city. She has seen much more people and experienced many more things than the townspeople of Westwind Town. Her thought is entirely different. She knows that the more influential the big shot is, the easier it is to become like Robb.For example, the great aristocratic men of the Bright Road also maintain basic etiquette, or gentlemanly demeanor, to people much lower than themselves. Still, their eyes are full of pride and self-confidence.For example, the archbishops in the Church of Light can put down their status and show a kind smile in the face of ordinary people, showing a gentle, calm, and holy demeanor. Still, when they look at the inferior people, their depths feel a sense of superiority.That is the \"I am better than you, I am more elegant than you, I am of higher quality than you\" attitude towards life!The more she looked at it, the more she felt that Robb was not simple. She squeezed Robb by his shoulder and whispered, \"I see that I can't see through you at all.\"\u201cWhy do you want to see through me? Are you interested in me?\u201d\u201cInterested, but not in the way you\u2019re thinking.\u201d Little Yi suddenly lowered her voice and whispered, \"after seeing your Holy Light Sanctuary, I understand that you are a very powerful priest, and your holy magic is surely way above me. Coupled with the fact that you came with little to no good equipment and weapons to follow after us yet appeared in the valley first.\"She did not say what she didn\u2019t know, but the more she said, the more doubts she had, and she could not help thinking in the most terrible direction, \"even if I am a fool, you have some kind of mission entrusted by the church. You must be investigating something\u2026 being Father is only your secret identity. You must be a heretic judger!\"A heretic judger is a position responsible for eradicating dissent from the Church of Light.Heretic Judgers are divided into two: the first are people who walk in the sun and look brilliant and upright, who often occupy high positions in the Templar Knights, and when they find heresy, they solemnly declare war and lead the Templar Knights to root out the heretics.The other kind of heretic judgers is those who walk in the dark. They usually hide their identities and disguise themselves as humble little priests, fanatic believers, or even pretend to be ordinary people. This is usually done when the church needs to deal with a heretic secretly. They will act like assassins and kill the target.Little Yi is now somewhat suspicious that Robb is the second kind of Heretic Judger, primarily because his identity is very strange, a priest at the border shouldn\u2019t be skillful at magic, but he is extremely great. The Holy Light Sanctuary he drew was revolutionary.Powerful yet low-key and placed at the border. I'm afraid it's not just heretic judgers who do this.\u201cYou\u2019re a heretic judger, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Little Yi asked in a low voice.Robb thought to himself, \u201cDid you use too many brain supplements? Who the devil are you calling a heretic judger!\u201dForget it! I don't need to refute. I'll use your words. What you think is your own business.Robb spread his hand and said, \"I'm not a heretic judger. I'm just an ordinary priest.\" After saying this, he winked at Little Yi on purpose and made an expression called \"you understand.\"Xiao Yi immediately \"understood.\" She looked left and right, took a vigilant look around to see if anyone was eavesdropping, and then whispered, \"Sorry, slip of the tongue. I shouldn't have asked so directly. You can't give me an answer now.\"Robb gave another \"you understand\" look and said solemnly, \"that's right! Do not ask. I can only tell you that I\u2019m not a heretic judger. You only need to know one thing: I have a vital mission. But I can\u2019t tell you what.\"Robb didn't lie. What he said was true! Indeed, he is not a heretic judger, and he is also charged with the important mission of \"making maid silk stockings.\" As for the look in his eyes just now, it is none of his business how she understands it.When asked afterward, Robb could just say, \"you're imagining it! I wasn\u2019t lying.\"Sure enough, Little Yi began to think about it. After thinking about it for a long time, she bowed her cold head and said, \"I see!\"\"It's good to understand. I'll quietly reveal a little bit to you for your clever sake.\" Robb whispered, \"I came to the western border this time, mainly because I took a fancy to the man-eating spider in the Black Pine Mountains. I want to take one back alive.\"\u201cWhat are you planning on doing with it? As far as I know, the man-eating spider has no other characteristic except the tough silk it spits out. Is there any research value for this thing?\u201dRobb said some nonsense, \"It has a human head, understand? I can't reveal any more.\"Little Yi understands a damn. She doesn't understand a thing in the sentence Robb just said; it's nonsense. But it's not really convenient to ask since it involves a church secret. She is just a small nun who follows a reconnaissance unit. How dare she dig into things. Robb's already given her some information and has taken good care of her.Although Little Yi still doubts Robb\u2019s identity, she\u2019s more inclined to trust him now. After all, Robb hasn\u2019t harmed her and even gave her a new weapon. He also has powerful holy magic. In any case, Robb looks like a church member.Because of that, Little Yi has no reason to suspect Robb.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The three pointed to the edge of the camp. Robb understood and followed them to the far corner of the camp.All four squatted down and huddled behind the grass. Gorda lowered his voice and said, \"Mr. Robb, did you come into the mountain to find the silk of the man-eating spider?\"Robb smiled and nodded, \u201cYou are so much smarter than the Baron and nun. They must have been in the organization for a long time. They are so naive that they still have no idea why I\u2019m really here.\"All three adventurers were happy, and Gorda whispered, \"The silk you got earlier from the web during the day shouldn\u2019t be enough for you. Do you need more?\u201dRobb took out some spider silk from his pocket, which was the silk of the cobweb that Gorda had cut for him during the day. It was so little, he sighed, \"It\u2019s too little! I need more. I will act with you, but my main purpose is to catch spiders. I don\u2019t care about the necromancer.\u201dGorda nodded, \"I see! Then we'll pay attention as well. The next time we encounter a man-eating spider, we'll try our best to capture it alive.\"Robb smiled and said, \u201cI\u2019ll trouble you for that then.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t say trouble. You have helped us twice and given us a lot of things. This time when we entered the Black Pine Mountains, the things you gave us helped us tide over several difficulties. We should do something for you.\"Jike, who is not very talkative, also nodded and said, \"Let us help you find man-eating spiders. We are adventurers and have a lot of experience looking for things.\"Robb has a lot of experience finding task monsters in the game, but it's hard to say the same in the real world. These three are familiar with this, so since they are willing to help, it couldn't be any better. He smiled and said, \"then when you help the Baron find the necromancer, also help me find the man-eating spider. It must be captured alive, not dead!\"All three adventurers raised their hands and made an OK gesture.The next day, early in the morning!Even though the sun had already risen, it couldn't be seen from inside the valley. At the same time, the scouts under the Baron dispersed in groups to explore the valley carefully.Robb and the three adventurers walked on the side, keeping a distance from the Baron's team, looking for a man-eating spider.\u201cPay attention to narrow and dark places.\u201d Jike said as he walked, \"That's the kind of place man-eating spiders stay in. Look carefully\u2026 The gap between two big stones looks like a place where spiders prefer hanging webs, but a poisonous frog is squatting next to it. Man-eating spiders are afraid of these kinds of frogs, and they\u2019ll surely not appear in the same area.\u201dThe others nodded.Robb listened modestly while being interested. Little Yi's head appeared behind him. She nodded to Jike and said, \u201cMr. Jike, thank you for your explanation. I really wanted to go over to see if there are any webs here. Your explanation saved a lot of time.\u201dGorda said, \"Sister, why are you looking for spiders? Aren't you helping the Baron find the necromancer?\"Little Yi didn't say it, but she thought, \"Although I'm apologetic to the Baron, the church is more important to me than the kingdom. Since the priest is looking for spiders, then I have to give it more priority.\"\u201cOh, look over there. It looks like a place with spiders.\u201d Jike pointed ahead, where two large, bare stones between which formed a small, narrow passage.\u201cIndeed, spiders spin their webs in such places. Let\u2019s go take a long,\u201d said Little Yi happily.The group of people quickly walked in front of the two big stones and got closer. Sure enough, they saw that there was really a transparent spider web hanging in the middle. Looking along the main filament of the cobweb, there was a small hole next to it. Just enough to fit the width of a person's shoulder.Robb could not help saying, \"this is the hole! The spider that was hacked to death by the Baron yesterday also hid in such a hole.\"Jike said, \"Now, we have to draw it out!\" This kind of thing is very timid and vigilant. It will not come out until its prey is netted and no threatening creatures are outside. So, all of us have to hide and send one person to hang on the web, and when the spider comes out, the people hiding will rush up and capture it alive.\"\u201cGreat! I can rest assured with you in command.\u201d Robb gave Jike a thumbs up.\"The question is, which of us is going as bait?\" Jike said.As soon as these words were spoken, everyone's eyes turned to Little Yi almost simultaneously!The latter knew what they meant just by looking at their eyes and could not help pointing to her nose, \"Why me?\"Robb said, \"you are a nun. If you don't go, who will go?\"Little Yi said, \"Why should a nun go at a time like this?\"Robb said, \u201cThe innocent nun was trapped by an evil spider and was saved by a group of adventurers. Isn\u2019t that how most stories go? Otherwise, if you think of it in another manner, a careless, muscular Gorda, trapped in a web. The nun runs out to fight the spider and saves the muscular man.\u201dLittle Yi, \u201c\u2026\u201dLittle Yi didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry, \u201cI accept then.\u201dEveryone agreed and kicked the ground, spreading out and hiding behind the nearby stones and trees, leaving Yi alone in the area.She looked around, sighed, and looked at the webs in front of her. Nothing much, let\u2019s go.She jumped, her body rotating mid-air. Hit! She\u2019s stuck!She did not jump nor resist like Robb did, but there was no doubt that she was stuck. Her left hand and feet were all immobile, leaving her only one hand to move.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Get ready!Little Yi is glued to the web, and she starts panicking inside. When a human can't move, their hearts panic.She had to say to herself repeatedly, \u201dDon't be afraid. The priest and the three powerful adventurers are hiding nearby. If I am in danger, they will come out to save me. Not to mention, I still have my right hand. If necessary, I can use it to pull the short firearms from my thighs to attack the man-eating spider.\u201dAfter saying this to myself several times, she felt much more at ease, pretending to struggle, shaking the cobweb, and staring at the little spider hole.At this time, Robb, Gorda, Jike, and Xuelu all stared with their eyes opened wide at the spider hole.When the man-eating spider comes out, the plan is to jump on it and capture it alive.Jike whispered, \"Be careful when catching spiders. This thing has two mouths, one on the human head and the other under its abdomen. There is a real spider's head. Both mouths will bite. Don't be bitten. Otherwise, you will be paralyzed all over the body and die of respiratory failure. Although we have a priest who can detoxify it, we should try our best to avoid poisoning.\"\u201cUnderstood!\u201d Gorda and Xuelu responded.Robb thought, \"I might as well use ice magic to freeze the spider since I don't want to use my hands. However, I fear that my magic's too strong that it will not only freeze but die. Ah! I can use an earth wall. I can cast it four times to trap it as soon as it comes out.Just as he was thinking of this, Xuelu poked him gently and motioned him to look.As soon as he looked, there was movement in the spider hole. Like yesterday, a foot was exposed first before a beautiful woman's head peeked out and looked around cautiously. It saw a weak woman struggling on the net and continued to leave its hole.Little by little, it slowly crawled out of the hole.Robb was overjoyed, and now he was just waiting for it to get out of the hole. As soon as it comes out, he will block its way back with an earth wall before placing another three earth walls, catching it instantly.The spider is almost out!Suddenly, a spider shouted, \u201cThere\u2019s a problem, be careful!\u201dThe cry was so harsh that it echoed in the open valley. Startled by the sound, the man-eating spider shrank back and returned to its hole.\"Damn it!\u201d Robb almost jumped with anger.He turned to look in the direction of the soldier's cry, just in time to see a group of soldiers running in the direction of everyone, running and shouting, \"be careful! Undead, a large number of them!\"Five soldiers stumbled in front, followed by a large group of skeletons, at least 50 wielding swords and shields, crackling after them. Before everyone could escape hiding, another five soldiers ran down another mountain path, shouting, \"Undead!\"Everyone turned around and saw that they were also followed by a large group of skeletons.The whole valley became lively in an instant, and people everywhere shouted, \"What out! Skeletons came out of nowhere.\"\u201cGather!\u201d\u201cGather around the Baron.\u201dThen, the Baron\u2019s voice rang out, \u201cI\u2019m a berserker, not a professional in dealing with skeletons. Assemble near the nun.\u201d\u201cUnderstood, understood! There\u2019s also the priest.\u201d\u201cThe priest can instantly paint the Sanctuary of Light and go to the nun.\u201dThe sound of chaos sounded everywhere, accompanied by the sound of weapons and the sound of broken arrows from time to time. Soldiers ran out in all directions, fighting and running, followed by a group of skeletons.In an instant, everyone gathered around Little Yi.Little Yi, while hanging high, saw quite far. She\u2019d already seen soldiers being chased by skeletons and was chanting silently. As soon as the soldiers reached her side, she shouted while on the web, \u201cHoly Nova!\u201dHer right hand, which was the only one that could move, released golden light, covering 10 yards instantly. All the soldiers at her side were treated, and their injuries slightly recovered.Several skeletons that rushed into its range were smashed by the power of the Holy Nova. And although her holy power isn't substantial, it had a significant effect on skeletons. The skeletons who rushed in the fastest were knocked by the holy light and flew back, almost falling apart.The soldiers were in high spirits, \u201cGreat! Priests truly are enemies of the undead.\u201dAfter praising the nun, the soldiers looked at Yi hanging in the web and asked foolishly, \u201cWhat on earth is the nun doing? Why hang yourself on the web?\u201dLittle Yi didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry, \u201cPull me off this net, and I\u2019ll help deal with these skeletons.\u201dSeveral soldiers hurried to cut the cobwebs while Yi continued to recite chants. With a wave of her hand, Holy Strike, and a skeleton soldier fell in the distance.It may seem slow in text, but it all took place in a moment.And by the time Robb and the three adventurers came out from behind the tree, it was already very lively. The soldiers were fighting against the army of skeletons, and from time to time, people were injured while skeletons were still drilling out on both sides of the valleys. It\u2019s unknown how many there really are.The Baron rushed out, followed by several pro-guards, one of whom was wounded in the leg and needed a companion to help him run. His speed was obviously not that fast, as he was about to be overtaken by skeletons. The Baron's eyes turned red, he used Blood Wrath and swept his sword, and the three skeletons were broken into six pieces.However, the undead was not so easy to kill, and the skeletons who were broken into six pieces actually recombined, crawled, and reunited to chase them again.\"Run!\" The Baron pulled his guard by hand and said, \"when you get to the priest and nun, you will be safe.\"Robb sighed when he saw the destruction everywhere, \"my spider must not dare to come out of the hole now! What should I do about the stockings? You guys\u2026 you guys must be screwing with me!\"\u201cMr. Robb.\u201d Gorda shouted, \u201cWe took the Baron\u2019s money, so we need to fight for him this time.\u201dRobb said, \u201cAlright! I can\u2019t catch the spider now anyway.\u201dGolda picked up his shield in his left hand, and the sword in his right hand roared and rushed up.Jike and Xuelu also shrugged and joined the fight with Gorda. Robb looked around, and fights were everywhere.What's the deal? It'll be quite bad if I stay lazy at this time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It turned out to be Little Yi. She blocked Robb with her delicate body.Robb asked, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dLittle Yi quickly said, \"Tell me first if you can take action or not. If you can't, you better not.\"Robb, \u201cHuh? Why?\u201dLittle Yi whispered, \u201cDon\u2019t expose your identity.\u201dRobb understood that Little Yi really regarded him as a heretic judger, mistakenly thinking that he was hiding his identity and carrying out a secret task assigned to him by the church. In this case, of course, he kept a low profile, and if he accidentally exposed his identity and something is seen by the Baron and his soldiers, the church's plan may be undermined.Out of consideration, of course, Little Yi asked Robb not to do it.Robb said, \"Can you really cover me if I don't do anything? Look at this area. It's full of skeletons. I'm afraid these are the stolen skeletons from the different towns.\"Little Yi looked up and looked around. There were indeed a lot of skeletons, hundreds of them attacked nearby, and many more came to land inside. Looking at the total, she\u2019s afraid it\u2019s reached the thousands.Robb said, \"This is reasonable. There are more than seven hundred skeletons lost in the town alone. Won't the necromancer dig up some more ownerless bones in the wild? Especially in these years of chaos and war, it's unknown how many bones scattered about in the wild.\"Little Yi bit her lower lip and said, \"I'll think of something.\"Robb said, \"Just give me a bottle of holy water first, and I\u2019ll paint the Holy Light Sanctuary. Anyway, this trick has been used in front of the barons and soldiers, so there is no need to hide it.\"Little Yi thought about it carefully, and it\u2019s true.She reached into her bag, took out a small bottle of holy water, and gave it to Robb. She then turned back to face the battlefield and chanted another holy nova.Robb took the holy water and cast the magic array, Holy Light Sanctuary.He waited 5 seconds, and while waiting, he looked around the battlefield.Xuelu used a fireball on the skeletons, turning them into a pile of skeletons.Gorda put up a shield in front of her and helped her block arrows coming towards her.Jike took out a silver-plated arrow to shoot, hesitated, placed it back In his quiver, and took an ordinary arrow and shot it instead.With his red eyes, the Baron charged into the army of skeletons with bloody anger and shouted, \"Damn you pieces of bones, present yourselves to me.\u201dAs for the ordinary soldiers, their situation was quite dire. Their combat power is relatively poor, but they can deal with two skeletons alone, but if it\u2019s ten times their number, they have to fight together.In just a short period of time, a lot of people have been injured and healed. Little Yi barely has the time to treat them now. They can only wait till Little Yi releases another Holy Nova and use normal treatment that works terribly.Five seconds, complete!Robb\u2019s Holy Light Sanctuary has finally finished activating!Swoosh!A golden, huge magic array spread out below everyone. A huge circle with a radius of 20 yards and a diameter of 40 yards froze all the skeletons simultaneously. The golden light rushed up from below like particles of light and made the skeletons go flying mid-air.After they froze for a few seconds, they crashed into the ground and became inanimate again.The skeletons outside the array were also startled. A skeleton soldier tried to rush in, but when it reached the edge, it seemed to hit a wall, and a bang sounded. Golden light particles exploded on its forehead.The skeleton soldier fell back, and its rusty sword that was raised high fell to the ground and rolled several times.The Baron was overjoyed and cried, \"it's the Holy Light Sanctuary opened by the priest. Everyone. Retreat to the Holy Light Sanctuary!\"The well-trained soldiers didn't need to be commanded to do so and had already retreated into the array.More than a hundred people stood in a circle with a radius of 20 yards. It didn\u2019t even look crowded, and they still maintained basic formation.The offensive of the skeletons stopped. They all stood outside the circle and dared not rush in. They were obviously studying how to break into the circle.The soldiers inside breathed a sigh of relief and briefly laid down their swords.\"Count the losses!\" The Baron shouted, \"Count.\"\u201c1\u2026\u20262\u2026\u20263\u2026\u2026\u201dThe soldiers began to count, and a soldier shouted, \"John is seriously injured. I'll count for him, 65.\"Little Yi hurriedly turned to look over. A soldier fell to the ground, his eyes closed, blood flowing around his waist. It seemed that he was badly hurt.She hurriedly tried to treat him, but just once, healing magic could do so much. The soldier was just injured too badly. Little Yi's healing could only restore half his injuries.Little Yi had to recite the chant for the second time.The healing chant has just begun. Someone over there shouted, \"Jack is terribly hurt. He needs treatment.\u201cSister, Mervin has a broken arm and is in urgent need of treatment. Otherwise, he\u2019ll be handicapped.\u201dLittle Yi suddenly felt that the situation was quite dire, \u201cPut all the injured people together. I\u2019ll treat them with group heal.\u201dOne soldier said, \u201cIt\u2019s reported that 67 people have varying degrees of injuries.\u201dAs soon as Little Yi heard the number, her brain stopped. Although she can use group heal, there is a limit to how many people it can accommodate, which is five people at a time. Moreover, although its effect is good, it consumes a lot of magic. She\u2019ll use up all her magic in just a few tries.If everyone is surrounded by an army of skeletons and you run out of magic, that\u2019s not a good sign.\"is military-level treatment still too stressful for a nun?\" Robb came out from the side and said angrily, \"Why didn\u2019t the Church of Light send a few more to come out with you?\"Both Little Yi and the Baron said with a bitter face, \"it's just a reconnaissance mission. No one expected it to be like this.\"\u201cForget it. I\u2019ll do it!\u201d Robb said, \u201cDon\u2019t look at me like this. I\u2019m a priest, too.\u201dLittle Yi whispered, \"Hide your strength\u2026.\"\u201cI can\u2019t hide it after all this, can I? If I still hide it, people will die.\u201d Robb said, \u201cI originally planned to get along with you all as an ordinary person, but in exchange, I was alienated. I\u2019m done pretending. I'm putting my cards on the table.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It's already a question of whether we can survive and return now. Even if Robb is a heretic judger, there's no need for him to hide now.She took two steps back and whispered, \"I'll leave it to you.\"Robb stood in front of the wounded soldiers, all huddled in Holy Light Sanctuary that was 40 yards in diameter and looked at the skeletons outside.However, the soldiers panicked when they looked at the skeletons through an aperture.Coupled with the fact that many soldiers were injured, their hearts became even more panicked.They are not chicken soldiers but veterans who have experienced many battles. They have seen the scene of priests treating them on the battlefield. Generally, a single priest cannot care for such an army-level injury. The army is often equipped with a special medical team, which requires the treatment of a whole team of priests.Otherwise, a single priest will exhaust all his magic and won\u2019t be able to cure all the wounded.As soon as Robb came over, some of the less injured soldiers took the initiative to step back, trying to get Robb to apply his magic to their more seriously injured comrades-in-arms.\"Father, treat my brother. He is badly hurt.\"\"Father, I'll be all right! John is dying. \"Robb smiled at them: \"Don't worry, it can be cured. No one needs to be let go. I can't be overcome by this injury.\"\"Ah? His injury is devastating\u2026.\" The Baron said, \"You sure you can still cure it?\"Robb stopped talking nonsense with them. In the face of doubt, the best way is not to explain with words but to prove with action. Even if you say a thousand words or say ten thousand sentences, shooting magic in their face will still prove more useful.Robb raised his hand\u2026Afterward, a holy light came out of his body, and he began to pretend to chant the mantra at the same time. He didn't chant It loudly, however, because Little Yi was beside him; otherwise, it'd be difficult to explain the differences. So when he chanted the mantra, he only uttered it in a very small voice, only at the volume he could hear, \u201cEat grapes without removing the grape skin, do not eat grapes but remove the grape skin, black fertilizer turns into ash, ash turns into black fertilizer, the pole is long, the bench is wide, but the pole is not as long as the bench.\u201dHe chanted for three seconds, twisting his tongue into several shapes.He stopped and returned his tongue to normal.As people in this world do when they cast magic, they shout, \u201cHoly Hymn!\u201dFor a moment, everyone seemed to hear the sonata of an organ, and then, it was as if a group of children was chanting the hymn in unison.Little Yi listened but could only vaguely hear the lyrics:The Pure Holy Love,Goes beyond all love.And the Joy of Heaven Falls on Earth.\u2026..The Almighty God of LightSeek salvationAnd receive God\u2019s grace\u2026\u2026The holy light flew like musical notes following the hymn, jumping on all the wounded soldiers. With each jump, a wounded soldier is healed. The sky filled with light, and the ground was full of broken shadows. The golden light waves gently rippled through, soothing everyone's bodies and minds.The seriously injured soldiers who fell to the ground got up one after another.And in a blink of an eye, all the wounded soldiers found themselves as if they had not been injured at all, and only the holes in their leather armor reminded them that they had been stabbed or cut by skeletons.\u201cHealed?\u201d\"What kind of healing magic is this? That was awesome! Everyone was cured all at the same time.\"\u201cJohn was so badly hurt that it was a wonder how he didn\u2019t die. How\u2019d he get up instantly?\u201d\u201cYes, me too! My intestines were coming out, but it was suddenly cured. I\u2019m so confused!\u201d\u201cOh, my God!\u201d\u201cThis is impossible!\u201d\u201cWhat kind of magic is this? I\u2019ve never seen it before.\u201d\"The sound of this chant is so holy.\"\u201cI want to kneel!\u201dThe soldiers had never seen such magic before, but several knowledgeable people had seen it.The Baron recognized this spell, a group recovery magic called \"Holy Hymn\" that can only be used by high-ranking priests in the Church of Light. Its effect is excellent. It can recover a wide range of wounded soldiers instantly, and the recovery effect is far higher than that of ordinary healing magic.It\u2019s no ordinary magic a normal priest can do!Even if young priests try their best to memorize this problematic and long chant and read it completely, they will fail to cast it because they lack holy magic, and it would not have any real effect other than making themselves exhausted.But now Robb just used the magic with a wave of his hand, and its effect was amazing. In an instant, all 67 wounded soldiers of different degrees were all restored back to health.Little Yi opened her mouth wide in surprise and thought to herself, \"What a powerful \"Sacred Hymn. I can't use this magic yet. My spiritual practice is far from enough! Now I\u2019m all the more certain that he\u2019s a heretic judger. He must be!\u201dAlthough the Baron was surprised by the magic, he was the first to wake up and roared, \"Hey, what are you all doing standing there? Hurry up and thank the priest, you bunch.\u201dThe soldiers woke up as if from a dream and quickly bowed to Robb, \"Thank you for the treatment, father.\"Robb said with a smile, \"It's a piece of cake. It's just some simple magic. It's no trouble at all.\"Everyone thought, \u201cYou still call this simple? It\u2019s so hard that it\u2019s dumbfounding.\u201dThe Baron exclaimed, \u201cMr. Robb, your Holy Hymn was wonderful! This is magic that only high-ranked clergy can use. I didn\u2019t expect a small priest at the border could use this. I really admire you.\u201dLittle Yi thought, \"Oh no, say a few more words, so the Baron will doubt what he's thinking more. A heretic judger can't let others find out about his identity easily; otherwise, it will affect the secret mission given to him.\"She didn't know that Robb had no secret mission or identity to reveal. Even if she did attract any enemies, he could only play tower defense, and Robb himself didn't care at all even if he did.She wanted to help Robb hide his identity and hurriedly stepped forward and said, \"Baron, let's think about how to break out of the siege. We are now sure that this is the Necromancer's lair. We just need to take the news back now.\"\"Oh, right!\" The Baron woke up and said, \"We have no time to waste. We have to prioritize how we should escape.\"He looked around and saw that thousands of skeletons were still watching covetously outside the golden circle 40 yards in diameter. Just now, when Robb was treating the wounded, two or three skeletons tried to break through the Holy Light Sanctuary. But they were all bounced back by the light, and now the skeletons seemed to be trying to figure something out, but they had only bones and no brain, and they also didn\u2019t know what they were thinking about.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Can you think of something?\"Golda spread his hand and said, \"there is a way!\"The Baron was overjoyed and said, \"what is the way?\"Golda pointed to the southwest, that is, the direction everyone entered the mountain from, \"From here, we forcibly kill our way through.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that difficult?\" The Baron asked unpleasantly, \"I will fight through too. After all, berserkers are the best at piercing through the frontlines. Then asking you three, what about your rich adventuring experience?\"Gorda said, \"now that we\u2019re surrounded by so many skeletons, adventure experience is no longer needed. It should be your army\u2019s combat experience that is useful. Are you sure you can still play such tricks here? There is only one way to escape.\"When the Baron thought about it, it seemed to be true.\"It\u2019s just a bunch of skeletons. It's not hard to get out.\" Little Yi said, \"With the priest and me treating everyone along the way, let's break through from the southwest.\"The Baron thought about it carefully. That is, although there are a large number of skeletons, they are only the weakest soldiers in the undead department, and their individual combat ability is not much better than their own scouts, so it is not difficult to kill them while we\u2019re being treated by the priest and nun.He pointed his sword to the southwest and exclaimed, \"Everyone, attention! Prepare to break through.\"Golda raised his sword and shield with one hand each and shouted, \"I'll go ahead and open the way for everyone.\"At this moment, Robb was thinking, \"Let's go, my ass! I haven't caught my spider yet, and I'm not going anywhere until I catch it, but now there are so many skeletons and people in the valley that the spider won\u2019t even come out. I seem to have to sweep the skeletons of this place and kick the Baron out of the valley. I only need the adventurers and Little Yi to help me catch the spiders.\"As soon as he thought of this, a dark and strange laugh suddenly sounded, \"Jiejiejiejie.\" With the laughter, a man in a black robe suddenly appeared. His robe seemed big but very empty. Everyone could still see that the body under the robe was extremely thin, wondering if it was just skinny or just a skeleton.He smiled a few times with his head down but couldn't just laugh. All these stupid villains have to look up and say a few words, pretending to be some bastard, and this guy is no exception.After laughing, he looked up, letting everyone see his face. It\u2019s a disgusting man as thin as a corpse, with his skin wrapped in bones.His face was pale, and his eyes were dead as if he could be blown down by the wind. Powerful black magic diffused through his body, which spread its teeth and claws like an octopus\u2019 tentacles behind him.He waved the skull staff he was holding, pointed at Robb and others who were in the middle of the valley, and said with a strange smile, \"Want to leave? No one can leave, jiejiejiejie! How can I let you guys leave and bring a bigger army?\"The Baron and Little Yi turned to look at the man, and their faces changed at the same time, \"A High-ranked necromancer! He has such strong magic that you can feel his gloomy aura from far away.\"Gorda, Jike, and Xuelu took a step toward Robb without hesitation. These three guys knew best how strong Robb was, so when they saw a strong enemy, their first reaction was to hug his thighs.\u201cWait!\u201d Robb suddenly said, \u201cCan\u2019t you be more creative with your entrance? The way you laughed and came out at the same time is so outdated, you know? If you do a 360-degree naked somersault and turn for another two and a half weeks, it\u2019ll be amazing and even surprise me. But I\u2019m tired of watching you laugh and enter. Go back and try again.\u201dNecromancer: \"\u2026\u2026\u201dBaron: \"\u2026\u2026\u201dSoldiers: \"\u2026\u2026\u201dSkeletons: \u201c\uff1f\uff1f\uff1f\u201dThe whole valley became eerily quiet, and after a while, the necromancer roared, \u201cThis is outrageous! How dare you be rude to me. You, I know you\u2026 You are that damn priest in Westwind Town! At that time, I was too far, so I didn't get to take care of you, but now you've finally come knocking at my door. You're just a little priest relying on the Holy Light Sanctuary to protect you. How dare you act arrogantly!\"Robb walked to the edge of the Holy Light Sanctuary, stood a little bit on the edge of the outermost ring of the magic array, and made a face at the necromancer: \"come on, come in and hit me.\u201dHe then said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t come in here and hit me, I\u2019ll come out and hit you.\u201dHowever, the necromancer is someone who likes some fighting, and before Robb even finished speaking, the necromancer interrupted him and said, \u201cThink I can\u2019t get in? Ha! I Watch me destroy your Holy Light Sanctuary.\u201dWith that, he chanted a mantra with his staff raised high.Robb had intended to shoot the fake criminal, but as soon as he heard him chanting, he stopped moving and watched the rest unfold.There are still many unknown things in this world for Robb. Only by observing more can he better understand the world. If he slaps everything in front of him, he will always be an outsider who knows nothing.So he raised his hand and got ready to see what the necromancer was planning.The Baron was not as idle as he was. As soon as he saw the necromancer chanting the mantra, he immediately shouted, \"Archer! Interrupt his spell.\"Several soldiers immediately jumped out, drew their bows and arrows, and shot at the necromancer. Still, they were at the bottom of the mountain valley, and the necromancer stood on the mountainside, which was extremely disadvantageous to the archers. The arrow was too weak to hit the necromancer, but no one doubted that the necromancer could hit them.However, in addition to the ordinary archer soldiers, there is also a powerful Archer adventurer in the team.Jike stepped out from behind Robb, kicked the floor, and loaded his Quickshot Birch Bow with a silver-plated arrow. Skill: Precise Shot.A silver-plated arrow came out of the string and shot at the necromancer's chest.The arrow was so powerful that even Jike, an experienced archer, was startled. He did not expect the bow sent to him by Robb would have such a powerful effect. Looking at the arrow, he will surely die if it hits the necromancer.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They were a head bigger than ordinary skeletons, with not only broken embroidered iron swords in their hands but also shields and helmets on their heads, which were obviously much better than the ordinary skeletons.The two skeletons raised their shields simultaneously and blocked in front of the necromancer.\u201cBang!\u201dWith the arrows shot by the birch bow, the bones of the first skeleton soldier were pierced through, and it was blown into a pile of powder and scattered everywhere. However, the strength of the arrow also diminished a lot.The second skeleton soldier raised his shield again, and the arrow was finally blocked by it and stuck onto the second skeleton soldier's shield.\u201cAh!\u201dJike, the Baron, Little Yi, Gorda, Xuelu, and all others sighed and expressed their disappointment.When Jike was about to shoot again, he saw a large group of skeletons raising their shields to protect the necromancer.\u201cI can\u2019t interrupt his chanting! Prepare for the magic.\u201d Jike shouted.Little Yi also began to chant quickly, \u201cTrue Shield!\u201dA small golden shield made of light shrouded Little Yi.Xuelu also read the chant, \u201cFire Wall!\u201dA wall of flames was then erected in front of her.The Baron beside her retorted, \"Hey, are you only protecting yourselves? What about us?\"Little Yi said awkwardly, \u201cIt won\u2019t be like that.\u201dBut Xuelu waved and said, \"you can come and stand behind my firewall. You see, Gorda and Jike have already squeezed in earlier.\"Baron: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe Baron was mad! A great Baron such as himself can\u2019t do such a shameful thing.The Baron ordered, \"break through to the southwest before he finishes the mantra!\"Robb grabbed him and said, \"Don't run about. Instead of rushing around at this time, you might as well stay in the Holy Light Sanctuary I painted for you, which may also block his dark magic.\"\u201cHuh?\u201d The Baron thought carefully that the priest was right and that there was no safer place in the face of dark magic than the Holy Light Sanctuary, and it was better to wait and see than to be hit in the back by magic.But he still felt guilty that he put up his sword and stood in front of him like a shield.The necromancer finally finished his magic and slammed his staff on the ground!A black, ghastly, terrifying smell poured out from the staff, and the dark magic surged and gushed in all directions. Even the naked eye can see the black mud on the ground.The ground where the necromancer was standing turned black instantly, and his surrounding soul began to blacken. Flowers and leaves withered instantly, and with the spread, even trees withered.The black mud spread towards the Holy Light Sanctuary.\"No, it's the Plague! It's very advanced dark magic. This is not good. If this thing spreads, it will destroy the Holy Light Sanctuary.\"This sentence startled the soldiers!The soldiers had a brief fight with the skeletons, and because of the wide gap in number, 67 were injured instantly, and they were temporarily safe only because of the protection of the Holy Light Sanctuary. But now that they heard that The Plague can destroy the Holy Light Sanctuary isn't this dire?\"Little Yi said, \u201cBaron, stop talking so much! Whether the Plague can really break the Holy Light Sanctuary depends on the power of both sides. The necromancer may not necessarily win over Father Robb.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026 The necromancer looks so strong. I feel powerful dark magic in him, but I can't feel anything in the priest\u2026 cough\u2026.\"Little Yi wanted to pull on the Baron's ear and shout, \"that's because the priest is a heretic judger. He deliberately reined in his magic to hide his identity so that you wouldn't notice.\"However, she could only keep it to herself. She can't really say it.The identity of heretic judgers was top secret and must not be revealed, so she had to comfort the Baron and say, \"Don't be afraid. Look at Father Robb. He's calm.\u201dThe Baron turned to Robb. Indeed, Robb looked calm and even seemed a little happy.However, as soon as he thought of this, he saw that Robb's expression suddenly changed from a happy expression to an angry expression that was about to jump up and hit someone.As it turns out, Robb saw something which annoyed him.The place where the necromancer is standing is just above where the man-eating spider everyone was just trying to catch was. There is a living man-eating spider in there, which is the supplier of raw materials for silk stockings Robb wants to get.However, after the Plague of the necromancer spread, it moved quickly, devouring all the normal ground, turning the earth into highly poisonous black mud, all the flowers and plants withered, and the earthworms, centipedes, worms, and so on in the soil, all died miserably one by one.The Plague soon spread to the mouth of the spider hole. The man-eating spiders are much stronger than ordinary insects, but who can withstand this Plague?If it still lingers in its hole, it will be killed by the Plague in minutes.The man-eating spider darted out of the spider hole crazily, running out of the Plague, not caring about how many skeletons were outside.At the same time, several holes in the area opened up for man-eating spiders to jump out at the same time.The mountainside appears to be where the colony of man-eating spiders lives, and a total of five lived there, all jumping out and running for their lives.Of course, Robb loves to watch this picture so much that he can't stop the expression on his face from showing and can't help but smile.He\u2019s ready to catch some!Just then, a skeleton soldier looked down at the man-eating spider running under his feet and chopped it impatiently. The man-eating spider screamed, and green blood spilled all over the floor.At this moment, Robb's expression changed, suddenly becoming furious.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You don\u2019t want to live, don\u2019t you?\u201dXuelu said playfully, \u201cMr. Robb, they are already dead.\u201dRobb: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe didn\u2019t have the time to play around and complain with Xuelu. He glanced at the mountainside and saw that there were still four spiders running for their lives with the plague chasing after them, ready to devour them. These spiders crossed countless skeletons. It is truly different for spiders to live. A tiger in front and a wolf at the back.Robb only looked and saw how hard the spiders were fighting for their lives. It really made people cry.\"Little spiders, don't be afraid, brother here is coming to save you.\"Robb rushed out of the Holy Light Sanctuary with a loud roar and straight to the nearest spider.This action startled the Baron, Little Yi, and the more than a hundred soldiers present. Only the three adventurers were calm, especially Xuelu, who already knew that Robb was unfathomable and had no intention of worrying about him.Little Yi shouted, \"Father, come back quickly. Without the protection of the Holy Light Sanctuary, it is too dangerous.\"The Baron also cried, \"Father, what are you doing?\"Without looking back, Robb said, \"Wait for me. I'll be right back.\" Two skeletons had already attacked him with their knives with these two sentences. He had no weapon in his hand, but he just reached out and gently pushed them, and the two skeletons were knocked back, bumping into each other and knocking over a large number of skeletons.His mobility skills, coupled with his 50% bonus movement speed, can only be described as sheer terror as he instantly pierced a path of blood through the skeletons. Oh right, skeletons had no blood, so he actually made a path of broken bones. He pushed all the skeletons away or broke them up with a punch.With just a flash in everyone's eyes, Robb reached the front of the man-eating spider, put his hand around its neck, and held it up with a happy smile on his face.Just then, a powerful skeleton soldier in armor and helmet jumped from behind and slashed at Robb's back with a knife.Robb placed the spider in his left hand and hit the skeleton soldier with his right, instantly reducing it to scraps. Then, he flashed and ran to another spider, holding his right hand out to catch it. Now, he was clutching a large spider in each of his hands.The man-eating spider's head is as big as a human head and has a huge body half the average person's side. Robb grabs it with one hand and puts it in front of his face.Everyone only saw the two spiders in his hand were still struggling with their jaws.Robb was so happy that he suddenly ran back to the Holy Light Sanctuary and handed the two big spiders to Gorda and Jike, \u201cHold it for me! Be careful to not let it die!\u201dGorda and Jike quickly picked up the spiders, and the nearby Xuelu took out two large bags and put the two spiders in separately. They were experienced adventurers who knew that this evil creature could not be put in the same bag, or they might bite each other.Robb then ran out of the Holy Light Sanctuary in a flash.The Baron doesn't even know whether to complain and said, \"Father, are you going out again?\"Little Yi said, \"The plague is about to reach the Holy Light Sanctuary\u2026.\"Robb went to catch the spiders again, but the Plague was already very close to the Holy Light Sanctuary, so the other two were getting closer to the array.Their intelligence isn't enough for them to understand the array painted on the ground in front of them. As soon as they hit the edge of the sanctuary, they will be wiped out instantly.But Robb was quick on the uptake. Long before they hit the magic array, he buckled their necks and picked up both spiders. Then, he looked at the sky and smiled, \"Hahahaha! Black silk, white silk! Here we go, hahaha!\u201d\"Father, watch your steps!\"\u201cFather, return to the Holy Light Sanctuary.\u201dThe Baron and Little Yi exclaimed at the same time.It turned out that by the time Robb jumped out of the circle to pick up the two spiders, the Plague had spread to the edge of the Holy Light Sanctuary, and everyone was ready to watch the \"collision\" between the Plague and the Holy Light Sanctuary.But unexpectedly, the moment before the collision between the two great magic occurred, Robb actually jumped out and stood outside the array, which was simply suicide.The Plague immediately went and surrounded Robb's feet.Several strange hands were stretching out of the mud, grabbing Robb's calves and trying to drag him to the ground.Little Yi hurriedly chanted for treatment.The Baron also jumped forward, ready to pull Robb back into the array.However, Robb suddenly lifted his right foot, and several of the muddy hands grabbing his right calf were torn off in an instant. Then he frowned and said impatiently, \"what the heck is that?\"With that, he stomped on the ground again!\u201cBang!\u201dA light sound came from where he settled, golden light spreading around the soles of his feet. And the Plague, which swarmed the area, was instantly pushed back as fast as it came.The skeletons nearby were holding their swords high, ready for the Plague to break through the Holy Light Sanctuary and rush in to kill all the humans inside. Unexpectedly, before the two even collided, the Plague disappeared, and the skeletons had to stand with a cute look on their faces, not knowing what to do.The necromancer on the mountainside also froze.He was so sure of his dark magic that he thought it would be easy to deal with a little priest, but he didn't expect something so unreasonable as someone breaking his Plague with one foot without even relying on an array.In a flash, Robb returned to the Holy Light Sanctuary and put the two spiders he had just caught into the hands of Little Yi and Xuelu, \u201cYou two also help me carry one each.\u201dThe two girls each carried a spider. Their faces bore complicated expressions.This is also thanks to the fact that they are all women who experienced adventurers and war. They surely won't touch such a big spider if they are normal women.The Baron looked confused and said, \"What's going on? Isn't there a very serious battle going on? Why did we get into the man-eating spider catching rhythm?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I'll show you this time.As he began to chant the mantra, Robb clapped his hands and smiled, \"I finally caught the spider, haha!\"With a spider bag on his back, Gorda leaned over and said, \"Mr. Robb, that guy is chanting again.\"\u201cOh, chanting again?\u201d Robb glanced at the mountainside, \u201cI\u2019ll watch and see what else he\u2019s capable of.\u201d\u201cHuh? Why don\u2019t you kill him before he finishes?\u201d Xuelu said.\u201cThen, I won\u2019t know how strong he is.\u201d Robb said, \u201cIf you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you only beat the enemy to death without knowing his strength, you won't be able to tell him who's BOSS. Such a thing once happened. A new girl asked me how to hit and stuff about a BOSS, and I replied that she could just cut it with a knife. As a result, the girl said I didn't answer her question properly and blocked me. Alas, she was a beautiful girl, what a pity. So, from then on, when I meet strange BOSSES, I observe the moves they have.\"Xuelu felt pressured. She had no idea what Robb was talking about.A few seconds later, the necromancer finished the mantra, the skeleton staff in his hand pointed forward, and countless bone spears came like meteors falling all over the sky.These bone spears are condensed by dark magic, causing them to be extremely powerful, flying in mid-air with a huge howl of ghosts, afflicting the minds of others.Everyone can't help but get nervous again!The bone spear shot towards the Holy Light Sanctuary, which started a battle between holy magic and dark magic. Whoever has better magic wins, and no mistake must be made. To others, the necromancer looks really strong, and Robb looks weak.Everyone was worried that the bone spears would break through the Holy Light Sanctuary.However, when the bone spears flew and hit the aperture of the Holy Light Sanctuary, there was a sudden golden light, as if a golden round cover appeared in mid-air.When the bone spear hit the cover, it cracked and turned into dust, flying through the sky and dissipating without a trace.Necromancer: \"\u2026\u2026\"Robb: \"is that it? Keep shooting\"The necromancer trembled all over. Just now, that move was already his strongest move, but unexpectedly. It can\u2019t even blow off a cover? Damn it, what kind of strange Holy Light Sanctuary is this? Why is this magic array drawn with holy water so strong?It is not that he hasn\u2019t dealt with priests before, and he\u2019s broken the Holy Light Sanctuary two or three times before. In the past, it was very easy to use a plague to destroy the Holy Light Sanctuary. Otherwise, he'll use a few bone spears and pierce them directly. What on earth is going on with this Holy Light Sanctuary? It\u2019s weird!This is obviously a sanctuary of light painted by him hurriedly with holy water. Why does it feel like a large group of high-ranking priests worked together to paint this \"Army-grade\" defensive sanctuary?\"Hey, if you don\u2019t do anything, I will take action.\" Shouted Robb.The necromancer trembled\u2026 He kinda felt like running\u2026Robb felt that nothing new could be dug out of this guy, so he reached out and dragged Jike's bow, then pulled a silver-plated arrow out of his quiver and smiled, \"Let me borrow this.\"Jike said, \"this is what you gave me. Please feel free to use it.\"As soon as they saw him holding the bow, they had a strange feeling in their hearts and thought, \"how can you use the bow? What are you doing? You don't know how to use a bow, do you?\"Robb took the bow, pulled it in his hand, took the silver-plated arrow he had just brought, pointed it at the sky, and shot the arrow directly above, then put the bow back in Jike's hand, smiled at everyone, and said, \"Come, let\u2019s go home.\"Everyone: \u201cHah!\u201dRobb said, \"Hah, what?\"Everyone pointed to the sky, sweating, and said, \"You shot an arrow into the sky.\"\u201cRight!\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you completely miss? Is that alright?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine!\u201d Robb said solemnly, \u201cright now, it will fall and hit right on the necromancer. Really, you have to believe me.\"Everyone: \u201cBelieve a ghost!\u201dThe baron said, \"I know that long archers have a unique skilled called 'Shooting,' but its aim isn't very good. So it's usually used by a lot of long archers at the same time to deal damage to an area. How can you hit the enemy with this shot?\"Even Gorda, who had always believed in Robb's strength, could not help saying, \"There are many skeletons around the necromancer holding shields and can block arrows by holding the shield over their heads.\u201dRobb spread his hand, \"you should believe in physics!\"As soon as his words fell, the arrow that had just been shot into the sky had already started falling. No, it should not be said to be \"falling\" because the word \"falling\" means that it has no kinetic energy and is being pulled down by the earth's gravity.But this arrow maintains strong kinetic energy. It's not \"falling,\" but flying!It just went from flying up to flying down.With a little intelligence and thinking, it was clear that the arrow must have turned in the sky; otherwise, it could not have maintained its kinetic energy.\u201cThis arrow moves!\u201d Jike was the first to react, \u201cIt\u2019s a hunter\u2019s tracking arrow!\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Hearing Jike\u2019s cry, everyone was surprised, \u201cWhat the heck?\u201d\u201cHunter?\u201d\u201cTracking arrow?\u201dA hunter is a title obtained only after the extreme practice of the archer profession. It's when archers that have reached their peak hunt and kill the most powerful monsters to obtain the honor.And one of the signature skills of hunters is their tracking arrows.The arrow locks on the target and flies around in the sky. No matter how the enemy escapes, it will chase after it. Unless the enemy forcibly blows the tracking arrow down with shields, swords, magic, and the like, it will chase you to the end of time.The arrow that Robb just shot into the sky is a tracking arrow.It first flew into the sky, then turned its head down and went straight to the head of the necromancer.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It raised its shield to the top of the necromancer's head, and the arrow hit the shield with a bang. The shield which supposed to have blocked the arrow instantly bounced back, and even the hands of the skeleton soldier raising its shield were broken to pieces and scattered all over the ground.Although the necromancer was chanting the following mantra at this time, he was also watching the arrow. Just looking at the coming of the arrow, he felt that the weak skeleton soldiers would not be able to stop it. When the skeleton soldiers helped him block this, he took the opportunity to take a step back.After the first skeleton soldier was lost, he brushed past it and flew behind it.As soon as he did, the arrow turned again in mid-air and shot again at the heart of the chest.A skeleton soldier roared \"clank\" and pounced on the necromancer's back, blocking the arrow with its body.The arrow passes through the skeleton soldier, and its undead killing power starts acting, shaking it into bone powder, and then continues to shoot at the necromancer.\u201cBone Wall!\u201d The necromancer finally finished chanting, and a large number of bones came out of the ground, forming a solid wall behind him.The bone wall is so thick that if the arrow is shot at it, it will almost certainly be blocked and lose the last bit of its kinetic energy.However\u2026\u2026When the arrow flew near the bone wall, it suddenly pointed up and went above it before continuing. It drew a ridiculous \"\u51e0\u201d shape mid-air.The necromancer shouted, \u201cFuck, you cheated!\u201d\u201cPang!\u201dThe arrow went into the necromancer's chest and burst a big hole in his chest in an instant. After piercing his chest, the arrow finally used up the last bit of kinetic energy it had and fell to the ground with a clatter.The necromancer, however, lost his life and fell feebly.The dark magic that he released, which lost its hope, disappeared, and the gloomy air in the valley suddenly cleared as if the sun had become brighter.Robb shrugged and sighed, \"I guess a bad guy is just a bad guy. It's so inelegant to use such a profane word before dying. I'd never do such a thing for a person of my quality. Damn it! Fuck! Gorda, be careful with my spider, don\u2019t kill it.\u201dEveryone: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe area became eerily quiet!Everyone was so astonished by Robb's arrow that they didn't want to speak. After a while, the Baron woke up from his astonishment, shook his head, and said, \"Father, your arrow is really an eye-opener!\"Even Jike, who usually speaks very little, can't help getting excited, \u201c A skill from a hunter! I\u2019ve finally seen it with my own eyes. How strong! It\u2019s so strong! I will also use this spell in the future. With that, no mage will survive my attack.\"Xuelu can\u2019t help sighing, \u201cIt\u2019s too scary; I'll use the 'instant transmission scroll' to run away if I see a hunter next time. I won\u2019t even fight.\u201dGorda said, \u201cHuh? You had another one?\u201dXuelu said, \"Ahem\u2026 ahem\u2026.\"Little Yi beside him was astonished as well. She thought, \u201cI don't understand this priest more and more. How does he know the skills of a hunter?\u201dRobb immediately found that he was being suspected again and hurriedly used his toes to grab a black stone on the ground. He stretched out his hand, and grasped it in his palm. He then let Little Yi and Baron see the look of pain on his face, \"Oh, this damn stone, it's sucking my energy. Ouch\u2026\u2026 This\u2026\u2026 this is a cursed black ruby? It may host the soul of a hunter's ancestor, Jonathan Josda!\u201dThe Baron and Little Yi bore depressed yet laughing expressions on their faces, \"Hey! You can't play this trick again. We already know that you and Xuelu lied to us last time.\u201dRobb: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\"Alright.\" Robb threw the stone aside, \"It doesn't matter; I'm the boss. I only took action.\"Little Yi had already decided that Robb was a heretic judger, but now she became a little uncertain after seeing his hunter's skill. She was so confused that she didn't know what to say for a moment.But the Baron said earnestly, \u201cThere are so many good hands in the Church of Light. I\u2019ve finally seen it.\u201dRobb smiled and said, \u201cIt\u2019s normal.\u201d\u201cYou are so modest,\u201d said the Baron.A soldier next to him called, \"Baron, the necromancer has fallen, but these skeletons have not fallen! What should we do?\"Everyone woke up and looked out of the Holy Light Sanctuary.The skeletons outside were originally commanded by the necromancer, but now that the necromancer is dead, they have lost their pillar.But unlike the puppets manipulated by control skeleton, they are monsters that have achieved immortality.So even if the necromancer fell, they can still move.The skeletons looked blankly to the left and right. There was no expression on their empty eyes and bones, but everyone saw they were at a loss.Pointing to the skeletons, Little Yi said, \"these are ordinary townspeople who have been stolen by the necromancer to become undead. Their souls are trapped in their bodies and tortured, unable to fly to heaven or fall into hell. They will always wander around the world blankly in the future, attacking all the living creatures they see. And since this place is their place of activities. It will become a dead area, and all animals and monsters will stray away from here, turning it slowly into a wasteland.\u201dGorda said, \u201cis it that bad?\u201dLittle Yi sighed, \"it is so bad that they need to be purified. Only by releasing their souls from the skeletons can they rest in peace.\"With that, Little Yi chanted a purification mantra, and the skeleton closest to the Holy Light Sanctuary suddenly stopped, and then there was a golden glow, and it made a gesture of stretching out its hands toward the sky. Something seemed to fly from the top of its head and rose into the sky, and then the skeleton slowly fell down, lost its life, and became a bunch of bones again.Everyone understood that the soul of this skeleton was no longer being tortured, and it should go to heaven.Little Yi used two more purification techniques and saved two more skeletons, but at the fourth, she stopped and sighed, \"there are thousands of skeletons here. I can't purify them all. My magic capacity doesn't allow me to. It seems that we can only go back to the Church of Light and invite more priests over.\"The Baron nodded and said, \u201cThe White Lion Cavalry isn\u2019t needed for this, but the Templar Knights need to make a trip here.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even then, for the grinding emperor, using purification magic a thousand times is nothing.But he doesn\u2019t really have a reason to do so!His grade and proficiency are also maxed. What's the point of using purification magic a thousand times like a son of a bitch here?No gain, no experience, no proficiency; these skeletons won't drop money or artifacts either.And this area is not his real estate either; even if it becomes a wasteland, it has nothing to do with him. He really doesn\u2019t want to meddle here, so he\u2019ll just let the templar knights deal with it.\u201cLet\u2019s go! Time to return. We should be able to walk through these skeletons easily.\u201d Robb smiled at the crowd and said.Gorda put the bag containing the spider on his right shoulder, held his shield in his left hand, and walked slowly out of the Holy Light Sanctuary.As soon as he went out, a skeleton soldier very close to him rushed over and waved its rusty sword.Gorda waved the shield in his hand, which slammed and hit the skeleton soldier, causing it to fly far away and fall apart, but its broken bones soon came together to form the skeleton soldier again.However, after it stood up again, it did not pounce on Gorda because he was out of its range.Everyone found that this large group of skeletons had not acted together as before but had become scattered sand, and only the skeletons close to Gorda would attack him. In contrast, the skeletons in the distance remained wandering pointlessly.The Baron rejoiced, \"Sure enough, it's easy to leave now. Mr. Golda, please find out what their range for attack is, and afterward, we can easily go out.\u201dGorda nodded, raised his shield, and approached a skeleton soldier not that far away.20 yards, no response, 10 yards, still no response, but when Gorda walked within five yards, the skeleton soldier suddenly woke up and pounced on Gorda with its knife.With a wave of his shield, Gorda knocked the skeleton soldier out of its range of five yards, and the skeleton soldier immediately wandered blankly again.The Baron ordered, \u201cAttention! Snake formation! We are piercing through the southwest of the skeleton army. Pay attention to the distance of the skeleton soldiers and do not get within 5 yards of it. If a skeleton soldier enters the range of five yards, blow it out immediately.\"The soldiers answered in unison, \"Yes, sir!\"The three adventurers cut open the way, and the soldiers walked behind with Baron, Little Yi, and Robb, walking cautiously through the army of skeletons; more than a thousand skeletons huddled in the narrow valley made it hard to avoid their 5-yard range. Fortunately, the skeletons that were more than 5 yards away would not come to help, so what they always had to face was only a handful of skeletons.Under such circumstances, it is really not that to get out of the siege.Effortlessly, everyone walked out of the valley, away from the area that had been occupied by skeletons.\"In this way, the reconnaissance mission will be perfectly completed. We not only completed the reconnaissance but also defeated the necromancer. When I get back, the Great Duke will surely reward me.\" The Baron said, happy to everyone, \"Thank you, adventurers. And of course, most importantly, thank you, Mr. Robb.\"The three adventurers said with a smile, \"Don't thank us, we are here for the money.\"Robb also said, \"Do not thank me, serving the people is my motivation to live.\" (solemn face)The Baron was moved, \"Father is really the kindest and most warm-hearted person I have ever met. I should have given father a great gift, but I didn\u2019t bring anything with me on this expedition. I'll send someone to deliver it to you when I return.\u201dRobb smiled and said, \"you don't have to be so polite!\"The Baron said, \u201cBefore I went out, I brought a scroll that can teleport to the Bright Road. I can open a portal that supports two hundred people. Will you come with me? I\u2019ll take care of you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not going.\u201d Robb is now focused on the four spiders he has caught and will go home to make silk stockings right away. Where is there any time to go to the Bright Road and take ten or even dozens of days to go home? Isn't that a son of a bitch?He spread his hand and said, \"the townspeople of Westwind Town are often injured. I am very worried about their safety. I must go back and guard them and be ready to treat them at any time. I appreciate the kindness, Baron.\u201d (solemn face)The Baron sighed, \"you are such a good priest.\"Robb said, \"I'm flattered. But I\u2019m not as good as you make me out to be.\"Little Yi handed the man-eating spider on her back to Robb, \"I will also return to the Bright Road with the Baron to report what I have seen this time to the bishop of the Church of Light and ask the Templar Knights to purify the skeletons here. This is where we say goodbye, father.\"Robb smiled, \"Don't say too much about me, okay?\"After hearing this, Little Yi moved slightly and thought to herself, \"is this a hint that I can't reveal his identity? Also, if he is really a heretic judger, then I can't tell too many people about him, so I'll talk to the archbishop in private.\"Finally, there are the three adventurers, each of whom is now carrying a bag containing a man-eating spider.Golda said with a smile to the Baron, \"We won't go to Bright Road. Unruly adventurers like us are not suitable to go to places full of big shots. We may offend someone because of our free and loose style. Haha. We'll help Robb send the spiders back to Westwind before we consider our next destination.\"The Baron thought about it carefully, and so he thought of something. He took out his purse and counted thirty gold coins, and gave them to Gorda. He smiled and said, \"the agreed number is 21, but this time I have accomplished the task more than expected, so I will give you 30 pieces, which is better.\"Gorda laughed, \u201cThis is why I love berserkers! If you\u2019re a magician, you\u2019ll haggle with me a lot. You know magicians like haggling over things.\u201dXuelu shouted, \u201cHey! What do you mean by that? Do you despise us magicians? Do you want to eat a fireball or two?\u201dGolda quickly waved, \"No, I'm just kidding. I have absolutely no intention of looking down on magicians. Ouch, stop\u2026 Don't chant. Stop it quick\u2026.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Like all other magic runes, Robb didn't understand them at all, and he couldn't help thinking to himself, \u201cI'm going to remember the shape of these magic runes in the future. In the game, each item is written with a name and a detailed description, so you can see what it is. But in the real world, recognizing magic runes, requires memorizationThe Baron took the scroll and said, \"this is a Strategic-grade magic scroll, which has required ten magicians of the White Lion Cavalry to inject magic into the scroll so that it can reach the carrying capacity of 200 people. Honestly, people of my status and title usually can't touch it. Fortunately, this year is the year of the Black Dragon\u2019s Flight, and the main army has to stay in the big city, so I was given a chance to take this out.\"He used the scroll, and purple-black light flew out, which is the usual color of space magic. The purple-black light converged slowly in mid-air, and it took about five minutes for it to become a portal emitting purple light.A portal to Bright Road!Robb thought, \u201cIt is mysterious that even a magician can open this portal in the game I play. And as long as the magician himself does not go in, the door will never disappear, and as many people as the magician wants can enter. But here, you need ten magicians to inject magic together to carry 200? It\u2019s so low.He now gradually understands that in the game world, a lot of magic is convenient for players, all of which are \"experience optimized.\" To make players comfortable in the game, they reduce a lot of stringent requirements, but in the real world, there is a lot of magic that is restricted in many ways.Teleportation is one of them. If this magic can be easily used in the real world, a war between countries will be tragic.It\u2019s hard to get near the enemy? I can just flank the enemy by opening a portal directly behind them!It\u2019s hard to attack a city with a wall? I\u2019ll send magic directly over the wall!In execution, I can send a bunch of people to the palace to kill the emperor.If teleportation could be used in this way, the world would go crazy.Therefore, in the real world, the use of magic, such as transmit, instant transmission, portal, and so on, are severely restricted. Either they\u2019re slow to cast, consume a lot of magic, or are difficult to learn.Robb can also guess with his toes that there must be strict restrictions on magic, such as flying and resurrection, but he hasn\u2019t seen others use it yet. But when he sees it, he will learn that the rules are truly different from those in the game.The Baron's soldiers lined up to enter the portal.Robb waved goodbye to the soldiers with a kind smile, half of whom had been treated by Robb with his sacred hymn, and the rest were protected by Robb\u2019s Holy Light Sanctuary. Everyone turned around to salute Robb before entering the portal.The Baron also saluted Robb, \"Father, are you sure you don't want to come? You still have to walk several days to get back to Westwind town from here. It's too hard. You might as well teleport it to Bright Road and then take a carriage back to the town using the official road. \"Robb smiled, shook his head, and said, \"I\u2019m used to walking on the mountain. It's all right.\"\"Well, I'll see you next time. I'll send someone to bring you a present in a few days.\" The Baron waved and entered the portal.Finally, Little Yi was left. She looked deeply at Robb and bowed, \"May the God of Light bless you.\"Robb smiled and said, \"May the God of Light bless you, too.\"The two didn't talk more nonsense, and Little Yi turned and entered the portal.Then, the portal became transparent, slowly disappeared, and finally turned into a purple-black spot of light that drifted in the air before disappearing without a trace.\u201cOh, those guys are finally gone.\" Xuelu immediately laughed, \"Mr. Robb, now we can talk freely.\"Robb limped his shoulders and said, \u201cThough those people who mingle with organizations a lot can't talk with us, without organizations, the world will become a mess and follow the law of the jungle. Whether in the city or the mountains, you'll have no sense of security. Therefore, it is still necessary for organizations to exist to maintain superficial fairness and justice, basic ethics, and morality so that people with some brute strength do not bully the old and the weak at will. \"Xuelu smiled and said, \u201cHaha, well said! I didn\u2019t expect you to have this kind of opinion.\u201dRobb smiled and said, \"I only know a thing or two.\"Xuelu said with a smile, \"in short, all the people in their organizations are gone, and there are only a few of us left. It's almost time for you to use your unique skills, right? You must be able to use teleport magically to get us back to Westwind Town. I don\u2019t believe you'll walk back through the mountain road. \"Of course, she knew that Robb could use teleportation magic, even that Robb could use instant transmission, but as long as Robb himself did not take the initiative to say it, she would not expose it.\"You are so smart.\" Robb said, \"Smart women are not liked by men. Stupid women are the cutest.\"Xuelu shrugged. \"A stupid magician? That\u2019s hard to imagine.\"\u201cHaha, you said so.\u201d In the face of the three adventurers, Robb was too lazy to pretend to say any more. As soon as he raised his hand, a blue light lit up, and a magic array with a radius of 5 yards appeared under their feet, which was \"instant transmission.\" Magic that can send a group of people out in an instant.When Gorda and Jike saw this, they couldn't help shrugging their shoulders and thought to themselves, \"well, now we know where Xuelu\u2019s instant transmission scroll came from. This Mr. Robb is really bad. He said that brothers are like brothers and that women are like clothes. But he secretly gave it to Xuelu.\u201d\u201cNo!\u201d Robb suddenly collected the magic, and the magic array on the ground disappeared without a trace, \"I almost forgot that this magic can only be used on five people at a time. Each of us is carrying a man-eating spider. They also count.\"With another wave of his hand, a purplish-black portal stood in mid-air with a woosh, just like the one made by the Baron with \"a strategic-grade magic scroll.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

My God!\"Gorda said, \u201cA single person is capable of making this portal? I\u2019ll just say that it\u2019s because it\u2019s you.\u201dJike mumbled, \u201cTracking Arrow! Tracking Arrow!\u201d\"Stop mumbling and go in.\" Robb kicked Jike into the portal.Every one passed through the portal easily and arrived at the chapel yard in Westwind Town. Lillian was squatting on the ground with a small kettle in her hand, staring at the field, murmuring, \"Why? The God of Light should have blessed this field. Why can\u2019t the pepper I plant ripen in a day? Why can master do it? I\u2019m doing exactly as he did.\"Robb smiled and said, \"Lillian, what are you working on?\"Lillian was startled by the sudden sound. A fart sounded while she squatted on the ground. She turned around and saw her master and the three adventurers, each carrying a large bag.Her little face suddenly blushed, \"Oh, master is back, I\u2026 I\u2026 I embezzled a piece of pepper and planted it in the field. You\u2026 you won't scold me, right?'\"Don't be so nervous about a piece of pepper. It's okay to use another two more.\"\"Master, you can't waste it like that!\"\"All right, go boil some water. I want to take a bath. It's really inconvenient to be away from home. I didn't take a bath last night. I feel so dirty.\" After Robb said this, he suddenly remembered something and turned to the adventurer trio and said, \"When was the last time you took a shower?\"The three spread their hands together, \"The day of departure.\"\"Oh, my God!\" Robb almost jumped up, \"Gorda and Jike, put my spider down, go to the mountain spring to take a bath, Xuelu, you don't have to go to the mountainside. Wait for Lillian to boil water.\"\u201cHuh, why are we being treated differently again?\u201d Gorda shouted, \"you can't be so partial to your friends.\"The yard was filled with a cheerful atmosphere.On the other hand\u2026Thousands of skeletons wandered aimlessly in the valley of the Black Pine Mountains because they had lost their leader.The body of the necromancer turned cold.A group of men dressed in black cloaks passed through the area where the skeletons roamed and came to the necromancer's body.The leader of the cloaked men whispered, \"number 32 was killed.\"Another man said, \"it seems he had been killed by a priest and an arrow. His dark magic was first broken, and then he was shot by a bow and arrow. There are a large number of human footprints in the valley, which should have been from the Kingdom of Gran and the Church of Light.\"Another man said strangely, \"I told you that he acted so arrogantly that he stole skeletons from human villages and towns to make skeletons. Sooner or later, he would be found by the Kingdom of Gran and the Church of Light. He should\u2019ve learned from us and only looked for bodies in the wilderness so that although it is slower, it is safe and undetectable.\u201d\"That was a really stupid idea.\" The leader of the cloaked men said, \"but thanks to him, more than a thousand skeletons have been gathered here in just a few decades. If we use it well, we can have a strong combat force, so I will accept it impolitely.\"He slowly raised his hand, releasing dark magic which pervaded the whole valley, and the skeletons wandering nearby suddenly turned to look at him at the same time and then crackled. They knelt on one knee neatly, obedient.A man said, \u201cNeither the church nor the kingdom of Gran will allow these skeletons to wander here. The templar knights will soon be sent to purify this land. And when they realize that the skeletons have a new master, war will be inevitable.\u201d\"Yes!\" The leader of the cloaked men said faintly, \"War can no longer be avoided. But we have nothing to be afraid of. We have been preparing for this war for more than three years. We had planned to send troops to fight simultaneously when the Black Dragon attacked to destroy the Kingdom of Gran in an instant. However, more than seven months have passed since the year of the Black Dragon\u2019s Flight, and the black dragon has not yet arrived, and no one knows which town the damned black dragon will appear in this year or if it even will appear at all. We waited in vain for more than seven months, damn it.\u201d\"There are still four months to go before the Black Dragon\u2019s Flight ends.\u201d\"We can't wait for the damned dragon,\" said one of the men. \"We must at least destroy the towns west of the Bright Road while the Royal Knights and White Lion Cavalry are stuck in their places.\"The leader of the cloaked men seriously considered the question and said, \u201cYou are right! We can't afford to wait. Spread out, attack the planned target towns quickly, and build up our power before the White Lions Cavalry react.\u201dA man pointed to the body on the ground, \"the original target of No. 32 was Westwind Town, but now he is dead. Who will occupy Westwind Town in his place?\"\"I'll go!\" A cloaked man came forward and whispered, \"my original target is the stone canyon, but it is only a tiny village. I can occupy the stone canyon as fast as I can and then take over Westwind town.\" (Stone Canyon is Lillian's hometown. For those who have forgotten, please refer to Chapter 10.).The leader of the cloaked men thought, \"All right, it's all yours. Note that Westwind Town, with a population of nearly a thousand, should be able to organize a militia with hundreds of people, and I heard that a priest has recently settled there. Although a town priest will not have much power, holy magic is the nemesis of our dark magic and must be treated with caution.\u201d\u201cUnderstood!\" The cloaked man who had spoken before folded his hands on his chest and retreated.Then all the people in cloaks dispersed and disappeared into the dark night.Only the last man in the cloak, who looked up at the starlight in the sky, said in a gloomy tone, \"I will rule you, Kingdom of Gran! No one deserves it but me.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The sun shone brightly at the chapel yard.Four man-eating spiders are chained to four iron pillars.Robb, with a thin piece of bamboo in his hand, is standing in front of the four spiders, giving a leading speech.\"listen to me, the four of you. From now on, spin your silk obediently. I will give you delicious food and hot drinks frequently if you do. But if you are not willing to work hard and bring me defective silk, this thin piece of bamboo in my hand will be in close contact with the most sensitive place on your body. I promise it will hurt. \"The four spiders trembled\u2026Robb found that they really seemed to understand some human words. It seemed that they had not grown a human head in vain.\"Well, first of all, I will show my sincerity and prove that I am not a capitalist who only knows about exploitation and oppression.\"Robb waved, and Gorda took four dead goblins from the side and threw them in front of the spiders, \"Here\u2019s some food.\"These four goblins were killed and carried back with the help of Gorda.Robb hummed to the four spiders, \u201cSee, if you work in my company, you won't have to spin silk and build a web to find your own food. In the future, when I feed you, you can eat. If you want goblins, we\u2019ll give you goblins. If you want ogres, we\u2019ll give you ogres... It is not uncommon to have a good meal with beasts once in a while. I can catch you whatever you have in the forest, so making a web is very wasteful. Why don't you just spin some for me and do something good for the world? Perhaps your evil impressions in people's minds will improve. Maybe in a few hundred years, you will be called beneficial insects by human beings!\u201dThe four man-eating spiders seem to have understood their fate of captivity like livestock and obediently climbed onto the corpse of Goblin and began to eat.When you are full, it is time to work.They have to do it. Although the bamboo in Robb's hand is very thin, it hurts. If any of the four spiders dared not work, Robb raised his hand and smacked them, and it was so painful that it rolled around on the ground. They had to hurry up and spin silk to not be beaten.Soon after, Lillian collected a large bundle of spider silk.The three adventurers sat by and watched Robb go crazy. At this point, Xuelu asked, \"Mr. Robb, you went through so much trouble to run into the depths of the Black Pine Mountain Range to get this silk.\" What exactly are you trying to do? If it is a robe, the strength of the spider silk is not enough. Apart from its toughness, it has no other advantages, its defense ability is very weak, and it cannot be enchanted.\u201d\u201cHey, who said I\u2019m going to make robes?\u201d Robb casually used space magic and took the \"silk robe\" made on his last tour and threw it into Xuelu's hand, \"this is for you. Do you think I am the kind of person who needs to make robes?\"Xuelu looked at the silk robe in her hand and immediately fell in love with it. She couldn't help sighing, \"what a powerful robe, it is made of a top fabric handed down from the Big Tang. This magnificent thing was given to me casually, showing that you don't need to make robes. \"Gorda shrugged. \"It seems Mr. Robb's going to make an earth-shaking artifact.\"\"Bingo! That's right.\" Robb laughed and said, \"You'll be amazed. It will be one of the greatest inventions of the new era.\"Xuelu saw Robb's strange smile and saw his malicious eyes fall on her calves.Although Western women are generous and not afraid of being stared at their legs, she still felt a chill in her back. She can't help but get embarrassed and put her hands around her calves, \"Mr. Robb, I think you are staring harshly at my legs?\"\"No, you're wrong about that. It is obviously full of longing,\" Robb said.Xuelu smiled and said, \"Really? Then, please don't just look at my legs, just propose to me! I might consider marrying you.\u201d\"Geez, come on, I haven\u2019t been single long enough.\" Robb said, \"Although I like women, getting married prematurely will only ruin my freedom. Women will make me do this and that and do a lot of things I don't want to do. It's too annoying. I won\u2019t propose to anyone till I\u2019ve had enough of laziness.\"\u201cHahaha!\u201d Gorda and Jike laughed, \u201cXuelu, save it. You take risks everywhere, but Mr. Robb likes staying at home. He won't want you until you're tired of adventures.\"Xuelu shrugged, but she didn't care at all. Westerners are very open-minded in this respect.With an agility BUFF, Lillian moved as if she was flying, and in a blink of an eye, a large piece of cloth made of spider silk was ready.This kind of spider silk cloth is really interesting. It is completely transparent. Holding it in your hand is like holding a transparent piece of plastic. With a little force, it can be stretched, and upon letting go, it retracts.Robb thought about it carefully. Since Lillian is wearing a maid outfit that imitates Ram and Rem, which, \"Lillian, dye it white first.\u201dLillian quickly took out the white dye and began to dye it.Robb used magic to dry it, and the white spider silk cloth was instantly made.Then Lillian used her unparalleled tailoring skills, coupled with her high agility. And soon, two pairs of white stockings were successfully tailored.Robb roared quickly, \"Quickly, go back into the house, wear it and come out.\"The last time Lillian saw her master rolling in displeasure, she knew that wearing this would make the owner happy. Therefore, she did not hesitate to return to her room and put on the stockings.On the other hand\u2026Gorda spread his hands and said, \u201cMr. Robb, I always thought you were unfathomable, and everything you did meant something, but this time, I really don't understand you. What you asked the maid to make is stockings, right? What\u2019s so interesting about it? All the aristocrats in the city are wearing stockings. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s such a great invention.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I don't know what to say.\"Jike also spread his hand, and though he said nothing, he obviously felt that Robb was making a mountain out of a molehill.Only Xuelu did not express anything. Magicians are all highly intelligent and seek the unknown, explore the truth, and study things that have not been studied, so until the final result of this thing comes out, she won't express her opinion.Robb smiled at Gorda and said, \"Complain now. But don't get down on your knees when you see the real thing and beg me to give it to you.\"Gorda smiled and said, \"It\u2019s impossible for me to get down on my knees and beg you!\"As soon as the words were over, Lillian came out. She had put on the white stockings, and with her beautiful legs, it can be called a match made in heaven.Elastic stockings are completely different from those worn by nobles of this era because they are elastic, so stockings can be made smaller, unlike inelastic stockings that have to be slightly loose.The white stockings were worn tightly on her legs, making the girl's legs longer and straighter, instantly making Lillian look a little taller. Her legs were tempting and fascinating.Jike froze in an instant, and Gorda smacked his mouth and whispered, \"Oh! My God!\"Robb was ecstatic and said, \u201cWow, Lillian! Turn around\u2026 turn around!\u201dLillian turned around as he said, and as she rotated, her maid skirt rose to the height of her knees, and her white legs looked more beautiful.\u201cAwsl!\u201d Robb fell to the ground and stopped moving.Gorda knelt on his knees without saying a word, \"How great!\"[Robb acquired white stockings]After a moment, Robb got up from the ground, glanced at Xuelu beside him, and laughed.When Xuelu saw his eyes on her leg, she knew that this guy was going to give her a pair of stockings. Eastern women may be ashamed of showing such, but western women were different. She smiled at Robb and said, \"You want me to do it, too? I don't think I'm suitable for white, though.\"\"Yes, I don't think you are suitable for white, either.\" Robb smiled, \"Lillian is still relatively young and pure. So white suits her, but you are mature and a very sexy lady. So, I guess you must wear a black silk stocking to look good.\"\u201cOne? What\u2019s with the strange quantifier?\u201d Xuelu asked.\u201cThe quantity is alright.\u201d Robb quickly took out the black dye.An hour later, Xuelu was dressed in an open-edged silk robe and black silk stockings on her legs. When she stood still, the robe covered her legs so that no one could see anything.But when she walked around a little, the open edge of the robe rippled, revealing the long black legs inside, and releasing a mature and charming charm that could capture a man's heart in an instant.Men couldn\u2019t resist seeing black silk and long legs; men of this age had never even seen such silk stockings. Gorda and Jike were dumbfounded. It\u2019s as if they had never known that Xuelu was so beautiful.[Robb acquired black stockings]\"Haha, black and white silk, perfect start.\" Robb put his hands on his hips and laughed wildly, \"Gorda, I told you, this is one of the greatest inventions in the new era. Are you convinced?\u201dGorda is convinced.Xuelu said, \"Mr. Robb, you are usually a low-key person; why are you smiling so arrogantly now? And Gorda, why do you like that when you\u2019re just obediently throwing in the towel and surrendered? \"Robb laughed and said, \u201cMen should be arrogant at a time like this!\u201dGorda also looked up and said, \"it's etiquette for men to admit their mistakes at a time like this.\"Xuelu spread her hand and said, \"I don't understand you men!\"After complaining about the two men, she looked down at the black silk stockings on her leg and felt quite satisfied. Women are all beautiful, but Western women are particularly more generous and unrestrained and are not afraid to show their bodies properly.She thought to herself, \u201cIs my robe too long? Wouldn't it look better to cut off the edge of the skirt and show more of my legs? Oh, but this robe was given to me by Mr. Robb. It's a very excellent robe. I'm afraid it's worth hundreds of gold coins. I don\u2019t want to cut it.\u201dAfter his great goal was accomplished, Robb returned to being lazy.---It was a sunny morning with fresh air, but at the best time of the day, he collapsed on his stone stool in the courtyard, looking like a ball of unlovable rubbish. Only when Lillian walked past him did his eyes sweep across Lillian's beautiful legs and slightly regain his vitality.The three adventurers went out since they received a mission from the mayor this morning.A group went to the mountain to collect some herbs and was attacked by goblins. They hid in a cave and sent the bravest man back to town to request help. The mayor then hurried to the church.He wanted to invite Robb to come forward, but unexpectedly, the three adventurers happened to be chapel guests, so the three adventurers took the initiative to take up the task and helped save the lives for free.Ah, the church is peaceful again!Robb expected another dull day, but unexpectedly, a fat head emerged from the yard gate and waved to him, \"Mr. Robb, do you remember me?\"Robb glanced at the man and recognized him as the fat businessman who had sold Lillian to Robb, vaguely remembering that his name was Pobo.\u201cOh! It\u2019s you, Mr. Merchant.\u201d Robb smiled and said, \"How long have you been gone? I can't believe you're already here.\"Rob greeted Pobo and saw a dwarf\u2019s head behind Pobo. It turns out that the traveling merchant had also come.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He makes a lot of small sales and fast-moving consumer goods and specializes in making small money from the townspeople. Of course, he also sells pepper and silk to the rich.Robb was a little surprised when the two merchants arrived simultaneously. \"Please come in and sit down,\" he said with a smile.Pobo and the dwarf merchant obviously knew each other with no real competition between each other. They were both friendly and rich, and they both grinned and happily walked into the yard and sat on the stone bench opposite Robb.Lillian hurriedly placed three glasses of coke on the stone table.Pobo picked it up and drank it with a wonderful expression on his face, but he had no intention of selling it. He smiled and said to the traveling merchant next to him, \"I\u2019m sure you had an idea about this drink.\"The traveling merchant chuckled and said, \"Yes, that's what I'm here to talk to Mr. Robb about.\"Pobo said, \"is it easy to make money on consumer goods?\"The traveling merchant smiled, \"Not any harder than your stuff.\"Seeing that the two merchants were about to talk endlessly, Robb quickly interrupted them and asked with a smile, \"doesn't it take both of you months to come to Westwind Town? Why are both of you back so soon? \"Pobo immediately said with a smile, \u201cOf course, it\u2019s because Mr. Robb\u2019s in town. I came back this time to ask if you have any new products.\u201d\u201cDid it sell fast?\u201d said Robb.\"Yes!\u201d Pobo said, \u201cThe flying dragon leather armor immediately attracted the attention of two nobles. They fought over the skin for several days. To buy it, one of them agreed to buy all my goods, so I sold him the armor, slaves, and some precious stones from Stone Canyon. I had no need to go to the Capital of Saints. I came back to restock.\u201dThe traveling merchant said, \"it's about the same on my side. When I got to the Bright Road and traded pepper with a nobleman, I poured him a glass of Coca-Cola and gave him a taste of it. Unexpectedly, he immediately asked to buy my bucket of coke. I said it was just a sample, and I wanted to give it to other customers, so I couldn't sell it. He said that if I was willing to sell him the whole bucket of samples, he would buy all my peppers. Because of that, I had to come back to restock.\"Robb laughed, \u201cThese nobles are so boring. Can\u2019t they spend it on anything else?\u201dPobo smiled and said, \"That's right! These nobles are rich but don't know where to spend it.\"Robb made money with Lillian for nothing. After a while, Lillian brought up two large bags of pepper and buckets of coke from the warehouse. And a few pieces of equipment that Robb made when he was bored in the warehouse.Both merchants got the goods, and Robb earned hundreds of gold coins for nothing. Everyone was happy.\"Mr. Dwarf.\" Robb smiled and said, \"Look at the stockings on my maid's feet. How does it look?\"The merchant, till now, had all his attention on Robb and didn\u2019t look much at his surroundings. So hearing what he said, he looked at Lillian's leg. Without comprehending or understanding it, he was startled, \"Oh, these stockings. This thing will definitely be welcomed by nobles. \"\"What do you think? Do you want to buy some goods?\u201d Robb smiled, \"I will probably keep making these socks here in the future.\"\"Of course! we have to restock.\" The traveling merchant hurriedly said, \"I'm sure it's a thing that can be sold out in the blink of an eye.\"\"But I don't have much of this either.\" Robb said with a smile, \"it's too slow and hard for my little maid to do it alone. I don't want her to be exhausted. So I need Mr. Pobo to help.\"Pobo immediately understood, \"do you need more slaves?\"\"Exactly!\" Robb said with a smile, \"No men, only women about the same age as Lillian.\"\"This is a trivial matter. Please leave it to me.\" Pobo said with a smile, \"I will go around the poorest and most remote villages and towns nearby as soon as possible. I will buy you a lot of female slaves and ensure that they are all beautiful and pure virgins. As you know, I only do high-end goods. I don't sell those worthless junk maids.\"Robb retorted, \"You dare say a maid worth 5 gold is high-end? I'm waiting for you to find me a good product with a reasonable price of 100 gold coins.\"Pobo said, \"Mr. Robb, please don't embarrass me. 100 gold coins are worth at least the daughter of a noble family of an enemy country. This kind that was caught in the war is so rare.\"Robb tilted his head, \"You can buy the daughter of a noble for a hundred gold coins? I just need the flying dragon leather armor! Then what\u2019s the price of the princess? I\u2019m a little interested.\"Pobo said, \u201cThis\u2026 a kingdom has to be destroyed before their princesses can be sold as slaves. In the last ten years, there has been no large-scale war, and no kingdom destroyed.\"\u201cHaha, I was just saying.\u201d Robb said, \"I am a good person. I do not seek disaster and watch kingdoms destroyed just to buy a princess. I won\u2019t order her to do something shameful and finally force her to turn eighteen.\" (solemn face)The two merchants thought, \u201cI believe you are a very bad priest.\u201dAt this point, Gorda, Jike, and Xuelu returned.With smiles on their faces, the three apparently successfully completed their mission of rescuing the herbalists attacked by goblins.Gorda still has some green blood on his armor, which should be the goblin's blood. He frowned as he wiped the blood with his hands. This armor is from Robb. It is so high-end that he is reluctant to get dirty.On the other hand, Xuelu held a strange thing in her hand.As soon as she saw Robb, Xuelu waved, smiled, and said, \"Mr. Robb, Jike found something good in the mountain. Oh, look!\"Before Robb could get close to it, the traveling merchant suddenly jumped up and said, \"Ah! It\u2019s a beehive. I smell honey. It\u2019s truly great.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Their only way to get a taste of sweetness was honey.It is common for several nobles to wage war for a little honey. The Cathedrals had a song titled \u201cWhere the Milk and Honey Flow,\" which vividly shows the nobility of honey.Xuelu put the beehive in her hand in front of Robb, \"Here you go. Although it's worth nothing compared to what you gave us, you seem to pay great attention to your diet. With this, you can make sweet bread.\"Robb really likes it. After coming to this world for over a month, Robb has hardly eaten anything \"sweet\" in his mouth. This world lacks sugar-making technology, so there is no sugar and caramel.Holding the beehive, Robb smiled and said, \"Thank you so much. Lillian, keep this and make sweet bread tonight.\"The traveling merchant swallowed hard and whispered, \"Mr. Rob, are you willing to sell this hive? I\u2026 I can offer a very high price.\"\"Of course, it's not for sale. Money is not as important as eating,\" Robb said.The traveling merchant had a regretful expression on his face.Even Pobo, who specializes in high-end goods, showed a strong interest in the honey and said with a smile, \"this time I came back, I heard that Mr. Robb has made a lot of interesting things, including tap water, Coca-Cola, and grew pepper overnight. These strange stockings as well. There may be a way for Mr. Robb to produce honey in large quantities.\"The traveling merchant was instantly refreshed and hurriedly sat up straight, \"that's right! Mr. Robb, do you have any honey miracles?\"\u201cNonsense!\" Robb smiled and said, \"What miracle? I don't even know how to keep bees.\"The traveling merchant said with great regret, \"Oh! I wish I could have it.\"This conversation made Robb think seriously about this problem. It has been more than a month since he came to this world, and it\u2019s the first time he\u2019s seen something sweet. He usually ate light and tasteless bread, which was hard. It can\u2019t go on like this.Robb seriously said, \"No, I need to fix the sweet problem. I want to eat sweets.\"\u201cYes, yes!\u201d Two merchants and three adventurers nodded together, \"Living without sweets is terrible.\u201dRobb thought carefully about how to get sugar in the western world. There's no sugar cane here in the West. He can't make marshmallows anyways because glutinous rice is needed to make marshmallows, and glutinous rice is not produced in the West.Then, the only way to get sugar - Beetroot!Robb knows a skill to make sugar from beetroot.Robb carefully recalled the picture of the \"beetroot\" item in the game, picked up a branch, and drew it on the ground, \"Take a look. Do you know this crop?\"Pobo regretfully spread his hand, \"Sorry, I don't know much about crops.\"The traveling merchant also looked confused, as if he had never seen it before.The three adventurers aren\u2019t even worth mentioning. They don't know anything about crops.Instead, Lillian jumped from the side and said with a smile, \"Master, I know this plant. It\u2019s called beetroot. People in our village called it a red carrot. And some people call it beetroot.\" (TL: Three terms of beetroot were used here: The first, \u83fe\u83dc, the second, \u7ea2\u83dc\u5934, and the third, \u751c\u83dc)Robb was overjoyed, \u201cMy Lillian is the smartest and most useful person alive. Where can I get this?\"Lillian said, \"in my hometown, Stone Canyon, someone planted this thing in small quantities. You can cook a sweet soup if you boil it in a cauldron. \"\"Very good!\" Robb said, \"Lillian, go and get some white cloth. I'm going to issue a new mission. I will pay five gold coins if anyone can go to the Stone Canyon and bring me a bag of beetroot seeds.\"\"Five gold coins?\" Even Pobo, a high-end merchant, could not help sweating, \"Mr. Robb, you offered a price equal to slaves for a bag of seeds?\"\"Is there a problem?\" Robb spread his hand and said, \"the mission is to pay more so that everyone can be happy. I hate those missions that pay very little yet are very troublesome to do. They are simply anti-human. They have to give cost-effect missions. Otherwise, I\u2019ll feel very uncomfortable looking at an exclamation point on NPC's head.\"The more he spoke, the more he became saddened and angry. He spread his palms to the sky, straightened his fingers, and complained, \"Don't release a mission with little pay. It is disgusting. I want to hack those game developers to death.\"The group of people next to him could not understand what he was saying, but they only knew that the priest seemed to have been cheated by someone and looked very angry.Gorda smiled and stopped Lillian from taking the white cloth to write the mission, \u201cMr. Robb, don't bother anyone else for this task. There happen to be three experienced adventurers here. We\u2019ll go to Stone Canyon and get the beetroot seeds back as quickly as possible.\"\"Oh, you guys would go? That would be for the best. \"As soon as it was agreed, the three adventurers packed their bags, said goodbye to Robb, and set off toward the Stone Canyon to the northwest. Westwind Town is not far from the Stone Canyon. It takes a few days to walk along the official road. Although there are occasional monsters on the official road, they are not powerful. With the ability of the three of them, it should be no problem to bring back some beet seeds.Pobo also said goodbye to Robb, \"I will go around several villages nearby, buy you some slaves, and then go to the Bright Road and the Capital of Saints to sell the equipment you gave me this time.\"Lastly, the traveling merchant smiled and said, \"thanks to Mr. Robb, I made a lot of money on pepper last time. It is much more convenient to transport pepper from you to big cities than to transport from the far East. This Coca-Cola should also bring me a lot of money.\"Robb smiled and said goodbye to them one by one, especially the two merchants, \"Work hard to earn money, okay?\"As soon as they went their ways, the square-faced mayor came again, and as soon as he saw Robb, he smiled and said, \"Father, the poor people in our village who cannot build water towers have recently joined together to put forward a plan. It is said that each family will give a little money, gather everyone's strength, and build a huge water tower in the middle of the village to supply water to all the town's residents. I've come to ask for your advice. Would you like to join us?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Not long after I passed on the technology of tap water to you, they themselves came up with this plan.\u201dThe mayor smiled and said, \"this is all thanks to you. It was you who taught the townspeople this trick.\"Robb said with a smile, \"the plan of concentrating efforts on building a big water tower is certainly possible, and it is better than building a water tower for each household. However, as a mayor, you must guard against \u201cOne monk carries water to drink, Two monks carry water to drink, and three monks have no water to drink left.\u201dThe mayor did not understand, \"Huh? Which monk has no water to drink?\"Robb had to keep it simple, \"that is to say, collective strength is sometimes not as great as one person's because everyone wants to be lazy. At such times, a special group must be set up to maintain the whole town's huge water tower and water supply.\"The mayor suddenly realized, \"Yes, that is indeed a problem.\"Robb said with a smile, \"and who will pay for this group? Which family uses more water, which uses less water? It is not clear who should pay how much. It's still not clear.\"Mayor: \"\u2026...\"Robb knew that it was impossible to make a big water tower in this day and age, and it was impossible to use magic, so the plan mentioned by the mayor could not be completed just by raising funds, and in the end, it was necessary to show him reality.He reached out and tapped gently on the stone table and said with a smile, \"well, I will pay for the construction of the giant water tower, and I will pay for the people who manage the water tower. On the other hand, residents who use the tap water provided by huge water towers will pay me a monthly salary. Pay more if you use more water, and pay less if you use less. As for who uses more and who uses less, let them count themselves. Anyway, the God of Light is watching them in the sky, and I\u2019ll see if they dare to fool the God of Light.\"Hearing this, the mayor could not help but shake in his heart, and suddenly found that Father Robb's move was a bit like doing business, and if the business was done well, it might be quite profitable.Robb smiled and said, \"Mr. Mayor when I look at your face, you seem to be very interested?\"The mayor smiled, \"I do have a little interest.\"\"Then I won't take the lead in doing the movement. You do it.\" Robb smiled and said, \"I don't do such troublesome things.\"The mayor was overjoyed that Father Robb had taught him a profitable business plan. Ha, great. When I go back, I\u2019ll quickly ask the workers to build a giant water tower and then let the slaves in the family manage the water tower. I can then collect money from the townspeople every month.The mayor left with a dream of getting rich.Robb looked back and thought interestingly, \u201cIt is estimated that it will not be long before the \"Westwind Waterworks\" will come out officially. However, there are no big water towers in this day and age. Brother Mayor, you will lose a lot of money in this business. There will always be some greedy town residents who bargain that a ton of water is only a bucketful. You can't lie like me.\u201dBut forget it, whether the mayor loses money or not has nothing to do with Robb. Don't meddle in other\u2019s affairs, and take good care of my own land.He withdrew from his thoughts, and his eyes followed Lillian, dressed in white silk, standing on the bank of the field beside him. Her long, straight legs covered by silk stockings blinded Robb's eyes, but she looked at the turned field with a lovely frown.Robb waved to Lillian, \"Lillian, what are you doing there frowning?\"\"It's already August,\" Lillian said. \"I think it's about time to grow sweet potatoes, but... master made my stockings white, so it is not very convenient to work in the field. \"Robb smiled and said, \"then don't work! It just so happens that I need this field to be empty, and when the adventurer trio brings back beetroot seeds, we will use this field to grow beets. If you plant a pile of potatoes now, you'll have to dig them up when I want to grow beets.\"\"But if I don't do something, I\u2019ll feel lazy.\" Lillian thought for a moment again and said, \"Then, I'll knit some spider silk cloth. The dwarf merchant said he would buy a lot of these stockings when he came next time, but we haven't made any at all. \"There are four man-eating spiders in Robb's chapel. They spit silk very fast. As long as they have enough to eat, they can keep producing silk from their stomachs. However, there is only Lillian in Robb's family. She is responsible for weaving cloth and turning it into silk stockings.Therefore, the first batch of silk stockings were produced in small quantities, only eight pairs, which had just been bought by the traveling merchant.Seeing the eight glittering gold coins, Lillian felt that she should work harder and make more socks to earn money for the family.Robb said with a smile, \"How many stockings can you make if you work hard by yourself? As far as I know, there is too much spider silk to use, right? You absolutely can\u2019t handle it all, right?\"Lillian said awkwardly, \"Yes, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m enough. if my master doesn't give me that thing called Bafu', I can't keep up with the spiders\u2019 speed of spinning silk.\"\u201cIt\u2019s Buff, bafu! I can't BUFF you every time I see you weaving,\" Robb said. \"there are some things that depend on you more, not magic. Come on, stop fooling around and go to town and ask the women who are idle at home if they are interested in helping us weave and sew stockings. I'll pay for them. All you have to do is teach them how to make stockings! When Pobo sells us a new maid for our family, there will be no need to invite outsiders to do it anymore. \"Lillian took the order, and it wasn't long before she brought back four women.These women knew Robb, and Robb knew them. They had come to confess before.They saluted Robb and followed Lillian into the spider room, and began to work.Because of this, their speed of weaving increased greatly, and it was no longer that Lillian could not keep up with the speed of the spiders, but that the speed of spiders could no longer keep pace with the speed of the women.Robb estimated that this should be the limit of producing stockings. The silk spit out by four spiders is limited after all and can only be supplied in small quantities in the future.Unexpectedly, that night, one of the man-eating spiders laid eggs. Moreover, it lays several hundred eggs each time. The spider eggs in the spider room were so dense that the women who came to work the next day screamed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He saw four large spiders still chained to iron pillars. Around one of the big spiders, numerous eggs were scattered, and the eggs were covered with spider silk. All well protected.The big spider that laid eggs had a shriveled belly and seemed to have lost a lot of energy.Robb said with tears and laughter, \u201cDid this happen today?\"Lillian and the four middle-aged women who had been invited to help weave and sew socks hid in the distance, poking their heads inside in fear, and nodded when they heard Robb's question. \"Yes, it wasn't like that yesterday.\"One woman said, \"No wonder this big spider was not willing to spin silk yesterday. It was about to lay eggs.\"\"This is really scary.\" Lillian said, \"we can still raise them a few dozen eggs, but we can't care for all of them, master. It seems that we can only get rid of more than half of the eggs and leave only a small part of them. Otherwise, if these hundreds of eggs hatch simultaneously, little spiders will run all over the ground. Disgusting.\"Robb was actually thinking about this, but he glanced at the middle-aged woman next to him and suddenly thought of hundreds of such women in Westwind town. They were idle, so he laughed and said, \"it's too wasteful to dispose of it. This kind of spider silk can be used to make silk stockings and can be sold at a good price, so it can form a very good industry. I'll build a big factory. We\u2019ll hatch these hundreds of spider eggs, use them for silk spinning, and then hire all the women in the town. Let's create the fifth largest industry for Westwind Town-- Silk Stockings Manufacturing Industry.\u201dAt present, there are only four industries in Westwind Town, namely, mining, hunting, agriculture, and herbalism. Apart from agriculture, the 3 industries are all high-risk and heavy physical work, and only men can do it. Westwind women do not have any real value except for helping their families do some farm work.Undoubtedly, Robb hiring all the women in the town will be a great act of charity.The four middle-aged women nearby gave Robb their most courteous bow, \"praise the God of Light, praise Father Robb!\"\"I don\u2019t indulge in praise.\" Robb said with a smile, \"go to someone and call the cloth merchant in the town for me. I'm going to build this factory, but I can't do it without the help of the cloth merchant.\"Soon after, the cloth merchant was invited.The cloth merchant in Westwind Town is actually a very small merchant. When Robb first bought Lillian a month ago, he went to the cloth merchant to buy black dye. As soon as he saw Robb, the merchant quickly saluted his father. Then he stood with his hand down and said, \"You called for me? What can I do for you?\"Robb smiled and said, \"you must know I use spider silk to make silk stockings?\"The town was too small to keep secrets, and the white stockings on Lillian's legs were too conspicuous. The whole town actually knew that Robb was making silk stockings since there was no privacy law here.The cloth merchant nodded quickly, \"Yes, I know.\"Robb said, \"my spiders suddenly laid hundreds of eggs. I wanted to burn them all, but when I thought about it, I thought it was too wasteful. I might as well care for all these spiders and build a large silk stocking factory. But, you know, I'm very busy. \"As soon as he said this, a strange expression flashed across the cloth merchant's face, and although he did not speak, Robb seemed to hear him say, \"cut!\"Robb, \u201cWhat\u2019s that look on your face?\"The cloth merchant hurriedly said, \"No! I didn\u2019t show any expression.\u201d\"Well, then I\u2019ll continue.\" Robb put on a pondering face, \"where were we? Oh, right, I just mentioned that I am very busy.\u201dCloth merchant, \"cut!\"Robb, \"Damn it, you didn't just look express it this time. You actually said cut.\"Cloth merchant: \"\u2026...\"Robb said, \"forget it. Let\u2019s get down to business. I don't have time to do things like factory and operations management, so I think you are very suitable to become a professional manager or factory director. \"\"Huh?\" The cloth merchant looked a little excited, \"really?\"Robb said, \u201cMost of the townspeople in this town are small producers, small craftsmen, who can't even do the simplest math. Only you, a merchant, can make the overall arrangements and calculations. I think you can do it. \"The cloth merchant was inexplicably moved!Robb said, \"if you only sell linen and cotton cloth, you won\u2019t make much money. Following me to make silk stockings and high-end goods is a better way to get to the top. I won't talk any more nonsense. I'll just ask you if you want to work for me.\"\"Yes, of course, I want to!\" The cloth merchant hurriedly agreed.In fact, the cloth merchant knew very well how valuable the stockings were because he and the traveling merchant were good friends.The cloth merchant\u2019s supplier is the traveling merchant, and every time the traveling merchant comes to Westwind Town, he will bring him some cloth and let him sell it in his store.Because of this, every time the traveling businessman comes to Westwind Town, he will have a chat with him.A few days ago, the traveling merchant came to Westwind Town and bought a small number of silk stockings from Robb. At that time, he sighed to the cloth merchant, saying that these silk stockings were the only good items in the Fengmo Continent, and the dignitaries absolutely liked them. It sells for a high price, but the quantity is too small.The cloth merchant listened to it and kept it in mind, but he could not get involved, and now Robb suddenly wanted to leave the business to him to manage, which was a great joy for him.\"Father, just tell me what you want me to do. I\u2019ll do my best!\"He thought about it and said, \"the first thing is to build a factory. You need to ask some townspeople to help and pay them. Just build it on a piece of land on the hillside behind my chapel. Pay attention to the problem of raising the spiders first. Ask some experienced hunters to guide us on how to build a house most suitable for raising spiders in large numbers. \"The cloth merchant wrote it all down quickly.Robb smiled, \"While the factory is under construction, you have to hire people. The division of labor must be made with precision. It should be divided into at least four groups of people. One group needs men who\u2019ll be mainly responsible for raising spiders and nothing else. The second group should be all women. They only need to weave cloth and don't care about anything else. The third group also needs women. They\u2019ll be responsible for sewing the woven cloth into silk stockings and nothing else. The fourth group is responsible for counting the number of silk stockings, putting them in the warehouse, managing them well, and shipping them to the traveling merchant when he buys them. If the traveling merchants can't catch up with our production speed, we can set up a caravan for the fourth group and ship the stockings to the Bright Road.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If everyone's work is divided into such, some people will be less useful. Won't it only lead to us hiring more people? We have to pay more for monthly salary.\"\"No, it won't. If one person does everything from raising spiders to weaving to sewing socks to selling, it will make it highly inefficient, and as a result, it will take a lot more people to do it. \" Robb said with a smile, \"A refined division of labor can make us hire fewer people and pay less salary. You will understand later.\"The cloth merchant didn't understand, but that didn't stop him from doing it obediently.After receiving some start-up funds from Robb, the cloth merchant went to the town to find people to build the factory.Before long, a large group of townspeople returned with the cloth merchant. Among them was an old acquaintance, the mason who built the water tower for Robb. He was very excited when he heard he was going to build a factory for Robb. As soon as he saw Robb, he kept saying, \"it's an honor for me to work for Father again.\"Robb said with a smile, \"what we want to build this time will enable all the women in the town to participate in production jobs. It will make everyone a lot of money.\"\"That would be great. My wife has always wanted to do something to earn money for the family.\"The factory building was built quickly. In this day and age, there is no need to build a house with a proper foundation or anything like a sewer pipe. They simply need to level the land, pick up a pile of stone and mud, and dozens of townspeople will work together in a few days. And voila, it\u2019s complete.Then there was the transportation of spider eggs. The cloth merchant invited the most experienced old hunter in town as a guide to move the spider eggs one by one to the factory building and put them in a small spider room.Robb heard the old hunter warning the townspeople who moved the spider eggs in the big field, \"be careful! There is highly poisonous mucus in the eggs of this spider, and although there is a priest behind us who can detoxify you, no matter how fast you are detoxified, you will still feel excruciating pain. I'm sure you don't want to experience that feeling. \"Hearing this warning, the townspeople dared not neglect it and carefully moved the eggs into the new factory building.Finally, the old hunter personally took the four big spiders to the factory, locked them up, breathed a sigh of relief, and finally warned, \"I must remind you that you must be very careful not to let one of them escape. Otherwise, if they come out to poison the townspeople, God will condemn you. \"Robb smiled and said to the old hunter, \"Don't worry, I will draw a huge circle outside the factory with holy water. This kind of spider is evil, and they don\u2019t like holy water.\"Hearing what Robb said, the old hunter was relieved, \"All will be good with the protection of the priest.\"The next step was to prepare many looms, sewing kits, and hire the town's women. All the preparations were carried out in an orderly manner, and of course, the cloth merchant did all these things. Robb just had to be lazy in the yard.Then, more than ten days passed in the blink of an eye.The first batch of small spiders hatched in the factory, and the \"spider raising group\" hired by the cloth merchant took the lead in the work. They were responsible for raising these little spiders healthily enough to spin silk.Robb really didn't know how to raise spiders, but fortunately, it was not a problem for the hunters in the town. They took good care of the little spiders.In mid-August, the heat was strong.Robb was still lazy on the stone stool in the courtyard when an uninvited guest suddenly appeared at the chapel\u2019s gate.Robb only glanced and smiled, \"Yo, it's Little Yi. What brings you here again?\"It was Sister Ishir, who looked exactly the same as when they parted, dressed in a blue nun dress, her hair covered by her hood, revealing only her little golden bangs, riding her red horse with a wooden staff across her back.Little Yi said with her expression still cold, \u201cI came to Westwind Town to be a resident of the chapel. The archbishop of the Church of Light has officially issued me the letter of transfer. So, from today onwards, I would like to ask Father Robb to take care of me. \"\u201cNani?\u201d Robb almost jumped up and said, \u201cYou want to stay? Who dares to shove a girl into my house without my consent? Damn! This is just\u2026 crazy. Good job!\"Little Yi dismounted, went into the yard, and sat on the stone bench opposite Robb. She really took a parchment out of her arms and spread it out on the stone table.Robb glanced at it, and sure enough, it was a transfer document issued by the archbishop of the Church of Light, ordering Little Yi to be transferred to the Westwind Town Chapel to spread the teachings of God to the townspeople of Westwind Town.Robb can not help but laugh, \"Little Yi, you have been demoted, ah, from the big city church, kicked to a small town church, isn\u2019t this sad?\"Little Yi's face was expressionless, \"it's the same for me as long as I get to listen to God\u2019s teachings.\"\u201cEn, I see.\u201d Robb's fingers tapped gently on the transfer paper on the table, and after a few seconds, he suddenly looked up and said, \"your mission this time is to spy on me, right? Or, to put it better, to observe me?\"Little Yi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dRobb smiled and said, \"Let me guess what happened when you returned this time.\"He changed his tone, pinched his voice, and said coldly, \"Archbishop, when I went out on a reconnaissance mission, I met a very powerful priest. He seemed to be a heretic judger.\"Then he immediately lowered his voice and turned into a hoarse accent, \"Oh? How can such a thing happen? I don't remember arranging any heresy judger to stay in Westwind Town. Are you sure he's one of us? \"Immediately changed into a female voice, \"his holy magic is very powerful. If his faith in the God of Light is not enough, he can't use such powerful holy magic, so he can not be outside the Church of Light.\"Robb changed back to his hoarse accent, \u201cGood point. Maybe he\u2019s someone directly sent by the Pope. He actually sent such a powerful guy to Westwind Town without informing me\u2026 en\u2026 Let\u2019s see\u2026 I must hurry to write to the Pope to see if he has any plans. Before receiving his reply, go to Westwind Town and keep a good eye on this man. If anything happens, please report to me as soon as possible. \"The cold expression on Little Yi's face burst instantly: \"my voice is not as bad as that.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The point is whether I am right.\"The expression on Little Yi\u2019s face changed, but she soon stood up and returned to her cold face. With a touch of embarrassment, she sighed, \u201cDon\u2019t just lay it bare like that. Why do you have to say it?\"Robb smiled, \"You\u2019ll seem more friendly if you just lay it bare.\"He told Lillian next to him, \"bring a Coca-Cola to make the nun happy.\"Lillian immediately went to fetch it.Robb turned around and said to Little Yi, \"Even if I don't tell you, you think I don't know? You must be ready to get discovered when you spy on me. I'm not happy that you\u2019re hiding it from me. I don\u2019t like it when you pretend not to look at or be very close to me. It\u2019s uncomfortable. So if I just break it to you, you can follow me generously, stare at me, and genuinely question what I do. Don't you think that's better?\u201dAfter Little Yi had thought about it carefully, she said, \"well, that's good, too. I don't like lying and deceiving people in the first place. The archbishop sent me to spy on you. I was against it and raised an objection. But the archbishop insisted that I do it, and I could not disobey his orders, so I had no choice but to come. Now, I can ask you clearly. Are you really a heretic judger sent by the higher-ups?\u201dRobb spread his hand, \"do not ask, I can only tell you otherwise if you do, but even if I told you, the archbishop would not believe me.\"\"That is to say, I can only rely on my own eyes to confirm it?\"\"Your eyes can't confirm it. You think lightly of yourself, so you won\u2019t believe whatever you see nor think. You'd better wait for the pope to reply to your archbishop. What he says will be more useful.\"Robb was a little upset when he finished saying this. He knew that once he exposed his strength, he would have a lot of problems to deal with. After the archbishop receives a reply from the pope, he might have to start playing tower defense. He feels bored just thinking about it. Can't the world give people time to be lazy?Robb said weakly, \"from now on, what I'm going to do is exactly the same as when you came here before. Keep an eye on my actions, and don't look away. Remember to record my actions in detail and send them back to the archbishop. After deep research and analysis, he\u2019ll have a basic understanding of my personality.\u201dWith that, he collapsed on his stone stool and continued to be lazy.Little Yi is a very obedient nun, and of course, to properly complete the task assigned to her, she took a sip of the Coca-Cola handed by Lillian. She sighed and thought that the drink was delicious, picked up a pen, and began to record in detail.Year 1344, the Black Dragon\u2019s FlightOn August 16th, Father Robb was lazy all day.On August 17th, Father Robb was lazy for another whole day.On August 18th, Father Robb was lazy for another whole day.On August 19th, Father Robb was lazy for another whole day.On August 20th, Father Robb was lazy again\u2026 and again... and again\u2026Little Yi\uff1a(\u256f\u2018 - \u2019)\u256f\ufe35 \u253b\u2501\u253b\"Father Robb, you are not a priest at all. Oh, no, you aren\u2019t even human.\u201d Little Yi dropped the record, pulled out her pair of firearms, and fired at it. She then jumped and screamed, \"Just turn me into a slug!\"\u201cNonsense, slugs can\u2019t touch salt, but I often eat it,\u201d Robb said.Little Yi said, \u201cThat\u2019s not the point.\u201d\"All right, get to the point. Isn't it hot when you jump, scream, lift the table, and use firearms?\" Robb said lazily, \"it's really hot in August.\"Little Yi was sweating, but the sweat didn\u2019t feel hot at all. It was cooled by Robb's laziness. She wiped the sweat from her forehead and said, \"can't you do anything?\"\"No! There's nothing worth doing,\" Robb said.Little Yi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dIt\u2019s pointless to talk to such an insane and lazy person. Little Yi used to say that Robb's laziness only weakens him and that he has to practice hard to become strong, but after knowing how good Robb is, she can't even say that anymore.She shook her head at Robb and sighed, \"I don't understand. It's unreasonable. What is the use of the archbishop sending me to spy on you? I shouldn't spend my precious time with such a lazy guy.\"\"That's none of my business. I didn't ask you to spy on me,\" Robb said.Just as they were talking about this, a knight appeared at the gate of the courtyard. He rode a tall horse and was dressed in light armor. as soon as he arrived at the chapel door, he dismounted and said respectfully, \"Father Robb, Sister Ishir, I am John. I don't know if you remember me well enough in the Black Pine Mountain Range.\"\"Oh!\" Robb immediately remembered, \"come on in, don't just stand at the entrance of the courtyard. It's too far away. It's too hard for me to talk to you while shouting. Come here, so it's easier.\"Little Yi, \u201cYou\u2019re too lazy to talk? Oh, my God!\u201dJohn tied the horse to the stud at the gate of the courtyard, put his helmet around his waist, strode over to Robb, and saluted deeply in front of Robb, \"Dear Father, I came here on the order of Baron Perseus. In the last reconnaissance, you helped the Baron to accomplish his mission beyond all expectations. When he went back, the Baron was rewarded by the Great Duke. He is very grateful to you. So he let me hurry and send you a small gift.\u201d\"Oh? Gifts?\u201d Robb happily said, \u201cI like gifts.\u201dJohn took out a small box from his arms and handed it to him with both hands, \"it's not a great treasure, but a little magic item newly developed by the Magic Research Institute of the White Lion Cavalry. The Baron said to give it to you so you could have fun. \"\u201cMagic item?\u201d Robb jumped out of his stool with a swoosh. He had never tried these. There was no such thing as a magic item in the game. \u201cGreat, let me see what it is.\u201dLifting the lid of the box, Robb saw a small metal jar that looked like a small teapot. It was empty. He couldn't help wondering, \"What on Earth does this thing do?\"John said respectfully, \"It\u2019s called a magic container! This is an item that can store magic. It\u2019s similar to a magic scroll, except that scrolls are used to store specific magic, and once that magic is cast, it is gone, but this magic container can slowly release the magic in it. \"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It can be filled with magic and then slowly poured out for use. No wonder it is called a \"magic container.\"There was no such thing in the game. Robb felt a great interest in it. He took it in his hand and looked left and right. Then, he infused a little bit of holy magic into it and saw that the body of the \u2018teapot\" slowly brightened up. A mass of golden particles rippled in its body.\u201cHow do you release specific magic after injecting it?\u201d Robb asked.John said respectfully, \u201cSorry, that is still being studied. The Institute of Magic is still carrying out its development, and so it\u2019s not perfect yet. At present, this thing only has the function of collecting magic and releasing it, but there is no specific magic that can be released. You see, click the button on it, and the magic inside will be released. \"Robb looked at the magic container, and there was a button, and the golden magic inside, like running water, ejected from the teapot's spout and dissipated in mid-air.\u201cThis is fun.\u201d Robb laughed, \u201cIt\u2019s interesting.\u201dHe was a little interested in this new thing. Although it was only half-developed and useless, it was much more interesting than what he was tired of doing. He smiled and said, \"John, please reply to the Baron. I like this thing very much. If there are any new magic items in the future, come and let me play with them again. \"John said, \u201cI will certainly relay your words to the Baron.\u201dJohn left with Robb's words in his mind and hurried back to Bright Road.Meanwhile, Robb returned to his usual lazy attitude. But he wasn't like a paralyzed man. But he sat upright, tossing the magic container around his hands.As soon as Little Yi saw his actions, she quickly picked up her record that fell on the ground. The firearms blasted two holes on the record, but this did not affect it. She picked up her pen and wrote on it, \"on August 20, 1344, Father Robb finally acted. He began to study a magic container attentively. He injected ice magic (He can do ice magic?),and shouted, \u2018Refrigerator\u2019. Then, he asked his main, Lillian, to bring a bottle of Coca-Cola and slowly poured the contents of the magic container onto the drink. \" (TL: I changed it from Ice Box to Refrigerator since it seems more appropriate)\"Little Yi, don't write on paper. It's a waste of life.\" Robb put a bottle of cold Coca-Cola in front of Little Yi with a smile, \"you see, we have a refrigerator. When we want to drink ice water, pour the contents of the magic container on the water, and we can make the water cold instantly, so you don't need to use ice magic every time you want to drink cold Coca-Cola. Hahaha!\u201d\"Bang!\" Little Yi slammed the stone table, \"such an advanced thing like the magic container should not be used in this way, should it?\"\"Why? Who said so?\u201d Robb said, \"then what do you think is the specific use of this magic container?\"\u201cThis\u2026 This is\u2026 Isn\u2019t the Magic Research Institute of the White Lion Cavalry studying it? I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll come up with something.\u201d\"Cut!\" Robb said, \"Study how to use the magic container for fighting? What's the point of that? I have ten thousand ways to beat the enemy, and I don't need a magic container at all, so it's better to use it as a micro-refrigerator. \"Little Yi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\"You see, we can also use it to make a simple stove.\" Robb injected fire magic into the magic container, then put it on the table and asked Lillian to set up a pot on it and fill it with water. Robb pressed the button on the magic container, and fire magic slowly flowed out, constantly heating the bottom of the pot. In a twinkling of an eye, the water in the pot boiled.Lillian poured out the boiling water and made Robb a cup of black tea.Robb laughed, \u201cHow fun! It seems we can do a lot of tricks with it. The Baron really gave me a good thing this time. It was worth going into the Black Pine Mountains to help him fight the bad guy.\"Little Yi covered his face and said, \"Please stop using the magic container like this. The magicians who developed it will cry.\"Lillian suddenly said, \"Master, can you use this magic container to move the ceiling fan you mentioned last time?\"\"Huh?\" Robb was overjoyed, \"Lillian, you're so smart. Come on, call the blacksmith. I'm going to build a ceiling fan!\"As a result, Little Yi continued to write on her record, \"Father Robb asked a blacksmith to make a long iron stick and put some strange fans at the tip, which looked a little sleek. The blacksmith did not understand at all. Not to mention, it wasn\u2019t easy to make it even under the repeated guidance of the priest. And then. Father Robb asked the blacksmith to create several strange things, which are said to be called 'gears'. Finally, he hung the mess on the tree and injected wind magic into the magic container. (How does he know wind magic?).\"Robb spread his hand and said, \"because it\u2019s too difficult to make a small electric motor, I can\u2019t use electricity for energy. I have to use wind to turn the gears to move the fan. When I figure out how to make the motor, I\u2019ll change it to run on electricity.\u201dLittle Yi said miserably, \"I don't understand. What's the use of such a thing?\"\"Gee, if you could understand what I\u2019m doing, wouldn't you be as good as me? Do your job as a spy, but don't expect to understand what I'm doing,\" Robb said.He waved to Lillian, \"come and sit under the ceiling fan. It's very comfortable under the ceiling fan in this hot summer.\"Lillian said, \"isn't this an instrument of torture?\"Robb said solemnly, \"when there are no bad guys to execute, it is the artifact that blows us air.\"Lillian made an \u2018Oh\u2019 sound and sat down under the ceiling fan. The soothing wind lifted her blond hair, making it wave. The picture was so beautiful that Robb almost froze.Lillian clapped her hands and smiled, \"Oh, it's really cool under the ceiling fan.\"\"Really?\" Although Little Yi kept a straight face, she moved without hesitation and stood under the ceiling fan. The wind blew on her face, and her cold face showed a \"very comfortable\" expression that looked pleasing to the eye.\u3010Robb acquired a ceiling fan (Wind-powered)\u3011Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It used to be just him and Lillian, but now it's much more complicated with a nun.Robb once took off his clothes and was about to climb into the tub when Little Yi came out of the chapel. After a loud scream, she hid in the chapel for five minutes and dared not look again.Another example is when Robb was drawing new suspender stockings for Lillian, Little Yi walked by. She kept a straight face and took a sneaky look at their drawings.The next day, Lillian secretly gave her a pair of white stockings. Little Yi then hid in her room for at least an hour, but when she came out, she didn't wear the stockings on her legs.Robb couldn't help protesting, \"Hey, I thought you went in and put on the stockings. Why did you come out barelegged? Why don\u2019t you just wear it in your room and take a look at it there? Why don\u2019t you want to show me?\u201d\u201cIt\u2026 it still feels a little difficult for me to wear.\u201d Little Yi's cold face flashed a rare touch of red, \"It's too\u2026 It's too embarrassing. I can't let a man see me wear that.\"\u201cCut!\u201d Robb complained, \u201cAren\u2019t you a western woman? Go to Big Tang, the kingdom of rabbit men, to be a nun then!\"In short, one happy thing, two happy things, three happy things, together they become the happiest thing.1344, the Black Dragon\u2019s Flight, August 23rd.It's turning night. The sun is setting, and the horizon is turning dark.Robb had just finished his bath and was about to go back to his stone stool to wait for it to get dark and look at the stars when he saw three familiar faces in front of him. Gorda, Jike, and Xuelu returned.\"Yo, you guys are finally back.\" Robb smiled and waved, \"you've been gone for more than 20 days. I thought you guys turned into snails.\"Xuelu said, \"We're not that slow! We found the beet seeds a few days ago, but we took up a mission in the canyon and helped the miners to wipe out a group of lizardmen who occupied the mine and came back a little late. \"Robb applauded, \"did you meet an elite lizardman? Lizard leader or something? That should be how your luck goes most of the time.\"The three were dumbfounded.Gorda threw out a bag of beet seeds and whispered, \"Mr. Robb, these are the beetroot seeds you asked for. There's also something else I should let you know. It seems as if something big is going to happen.\"\"Oh?\" Robb asked, \u201cWhat is it?\u201dGolda whispered, \"While we were walking a short distance from the canyon, we heard a strange sound in the forest, so we slipped up to the mountain to have a look. As a result... we saw a large number of skeletons marching together. \"\"Hmm?\" Robb frowned, \"They\u2019re coming to attack Westwind town?\"\"No! They\u2019re headed for the Stone Canyon.\u201d Gorda said, \"there is e a large number of skeletons, no less than two thousand at a glance, more than the last time in the Black Mountain Range. After seeing this, we were startled and rushed to Westwind Town as fast as possible to inform you, but it took us more than three days to get here. The army of undead should have captured the Stone Canyon a while ago. \"Robb didn't respond to this, but Little Yi rushed out and cried out in surprise,\" What? More than 2,000 skeletons? That's impossible! Where on earth did they come from?\"\u201cWoah, the nun is here too? I thought you wouldn\u2019t come here again after you went to Bright Road.\u201d Golda spread his hand and said, \"God knows where those skeletons came from. We are just adventurers, not the omniscient God of Light.\"Little Yi said, \"Don't be mistaken!\"Gorda said, \"Hey, sister, do you really think we'd see incorrectly? Do you think we are idiots?\"Little Yi was anxious and could barely hold her cold expression, \"this is not good, no. I have to relay this to Bright Road as soon as possible. I will go to the mayor's house and ask him to send someone to Bright Road.\"She ran quickly out of the chapel to the mayor's house. It was getting dark, so it was worrying for her to run into the dark town alone, but before Robb could say anything, he saw a golden light on her. She used holy light blessing, illuminating the town's road.Robb was relieved to see that she was on her way. No one in this little westerly town dared to attack a nun with the blessing of the holy light.Robb meditated for a few seconds and said, \"So, let's get this straight. A necromancer summoned skeletons and was killed by us, and then, three days later, you found another necromancer attacking the Stone Canyon with skeletons. That's what's happening now, right? \"The three adventurers nodded heavily, \"this is a bad sign! There has to be more than one necromancer, and although we eliminated one, other necromancers are taking action. After this army of skeletons takes over the Stone Canyon, they will likely come after us. After all, this is the only way to Bright Road from there.\"Robb turned his head and said, \"Lillian, prepare the ceiling fan!\"\u201cUnderstood!\u201d Lillian answered in a low voice.Three adventurers: \"\u2026...\"Xuelu asked, \u201cWhat does preparing the ceiling fan mean?\u201dRobb shrugged and said, \"The ceiling fan is not only an artifact but also an instrument of torture, as well as my attitude. I don't like trouble, and I hate trouble, but when trouble comes to me, I\u2019ll prepare a ceiling fan for him. This is my philosophy of life, see?\"Three adventurers, \u201cUnderstand my ghost!\u201dRobb wanted to continue spouting nonsense but suddenly found that Lillian's expression seemed a little strange, as if she was desperately worried about something.\"What's the matter?\" Robb asked in a low voice, \"Lillian, I rarely see that look on your face.\"Lillian whispered, \u201cThe Stone\u2026 The Stone Canyon\u2026 is my hometown.\u201dRobb's brow frowned slightly.Lillian said, \u201cMy\u2026 My aunt lives there.\u201d\"Isn\u2019t she the one who sold you to the slave merchant?\" Robb's brow continued to frown, \"such a person can't be called an aunt. You don't have to worry about her.\"\"But\u2026 but\u2026 I\u2019m worried.\u201d Lillian's face darkened. \"Bless the God of Light. I hope she's all right.\"She knew it was no use worrying. It has been three days since the three adventurers saw the army of skeletons. It would be too late now for anyone to come to the rescue if something happened.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It seemed that his wound had been healed by Little Yi.The mayor said anxiously, \"Father, something big has happened. Just as the nun came to see me and we were about to send a slave to Bright Road to report the news, an injured messenger came. He came from a small town on the edges of the birch forest. According to him, the town and several villages in the birch forest were attacked by a large number of skeletons at the same time. The mayor there decided to abandon the town and retreat toward us. The refugees would soon arrive in Westwind town.\u201dWhile talking to Robb, the man who had sent the message turned to Gorda and gave him a big salute, \"Mr. Gorda, do you remember me?\"Golda said, \"of course, we were almost slaughtered by the ogre leader who came to retaliate. Because of that commission from your village, we lost a lot of blood.\"The two of them were chatting over there, while Robb on this side was frowning and talking to the mayor, \"just now came the news that the Stone Canyon had been attacked came, yet the White Birch Forest is being attacked? In other words\u2026All the villages and towns around here are probably being attacked, aren't they? Damn, I smell trouble again.\"Rob stretched out his hands, spread his fingers, and complained to the sky, \"F**k your mother, can you give me a few more days of laziness?\"Little Yi looked over with suspicion, \"Father, who are you cursing? You're not complaining to our beloved God of Light, are you?\"\"That's impossible.\" Robb immediately restored his serious face, \"I am scolding the gods on the wrong side, yes, the dark God worshipped by the necromancers. I despise it from the bottom of my heart. I despise it!\"Little Yi shared a common hatred of the enemy and said, \"Yes, I despise it, too!\"Hodr, the God of Darkness, is a dark god wicked beyond redemption. He is sinister, reclusive, cruel, and insists on being the enemy of light. It was he who killed Baldr, the God of Light, and will forever be the enemy of our Church of Light. \"Robb quickly remembered the names of both the God of light and the God of darkness and thought, \"Ah, great! Someone introduced the background of the world, and I won\u2019t have any problems saying the names of the two guys anymore. One is called Baldr; the other is called Hodr. Don\u2019t they seem like brothers?\u201dAt this moment, Little Yi suddenly thought of something and turned to Xuelu and said, \"Holder was instructed by Loki, the God of Fire, to kill the God of Light. Your faith is also a culprit.\"\"Oh, sister, you seem to be mistaken about something.\" Xuelu spread her hand and said, \"although I borrow fire magic from Loki, I don't believe in him. We magicians never believe in gods. Our relationship with God is just simple transaction and exploitation. If Loki asked me to kneel to him, I would smash my staff on his forehead. Then I\u2019ll turn to the Goddess of Winter, Skadi, and borrow some ice arrows from her to ward off my enemies! From then, I\u2019ll have switched from fire magic to ice magic. Isn\u2019t it interesting?\"Little Yi: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cHahaha!\u201d Robb couldn\u2019t help but laugh, \u201cYou are quite cute.\u201dXuelu said, \u201cI think I\u2019m cute, too.\u201dLittle Yi slapped her face on the table and said with a cold face, \"can you get to the point? Countless undead are attacking villages on the western border, the Stone Canyon and the Birch Forest have been attacked, and it is conceivable that many villages and towns are experiencing the same thing. How are you still in the mood to discuss whether you are cute or not?\"Robb turned to Little Yi, \u201cAlright, let\u2019s get to the point. Little Yi, what do you think we should do now?\u201dLittle Yi said, \"I have two plans. The first is to adopt the retreat strategy like the mayor of Birch Forest and lead all the townspeople to Bright Road before the army of the undead arrives. There is a formidable castle there, together with the White Lion Cavalry. We will be very safe there. When things calm down, we\u2019ll return to Westwind Town.\"The mayor\u2019s face suddenly changed, \u201cThe waterworks are just about to be built too.\u201dLillian also cried, \"Master's stockings factory, the spiders just hatched, and we\u2019re just waiting for them to grow up. How can we move them at this time?\"Little Yi glared at both of them angrily, \"if you don't retreat, you will die. What is the use of these things when you die?\"Robb smiled, \"Let's talk about the second plan. I guess your second plan must be to stick to Westwind Town and wait for Bright Road to come to the rescue. I think this plan is more reliable.\"Little Yi said, \"I don't think it\u2019s reliable.\"Robb said, \"although I am tired of playing tower defense, I am quite good at it.\"He is saying strange things again, but Little Yi has long been used to hearing strange words from his mouth that she doesn\u2019t understand. She is so used to it that she\u2019s too lazy to retort now. Anyway, as long as she understands the gist, it\u2019s fine.She asked solemnly, \"Father, do you mean to build defensive towers in the town against the legions of the undead?\"\"The construction of defense towers is the oldest method of tower defense.\" Robb said, \"later, the tower defense game evolved countless times, and there have been many variants, such as summoning monsters to be used as towers and even summoning heroes to be used as towers. Heroes can also cast magic and skills. In short, tower defense can be played in a variety of ways, and you must not think that the only way to play it is by building towers.\u201dLittle Yi: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dRobb also knew that she didn't understand what he was saying, so he didn't continue. Robb asked, \"Little Yi, if you have to draw a huge Holy Light Sanctuary that encompasses the entirety of Westwind Town, how long will it take?\"Little Yi shook her head and said, \"If I draw it by myself, at least for a few months. Right. You have the ink splashing technique. Can\u2019t you finish it quickly?\"Robb shook his head. \"can you throw a bottle of holy water far enough to reach the edges of the town?\"Little Yi thought, \u201cThis is also true. Although the \"Ink Splashing Technique\" is powerful, it is not so practical. There is no reason to splash ink around the town, so we have to give it up.In fact, Robb really can't draw a magic array that can cover the size of a town.Although he is very powerful, his magic also has disadvantages: it is not flexible enough, such as the Holy Light Sanctuary. People here can draw as big as they want and as small as they want.But Robb can\u2019t. He\u2019s limited to a Holy Light Sanctuary with a radius of 20 yards. That\u2019s because it\u2019s how the game developers designed it.TL: I\u2019ve changed Balder to Baldr. I\u2019ve never been into mythology, so I didn\u2019t know that the novel actually followed Norse mythology.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

How tiring. It\u2019s great to be lazy here. He doesn\u2019t want to evacuate anywhere, \"I think it's all right. If you want to evacuate, you should evacuate, and if you want to stay, you can stay. We should fully respect the freedom of the townspeople, and we should not force innocent people to go to war. Of course, I am willing to stay. I love my motherland very much and swear to defend every inch of land for our kingdom. I will never let others take away our precious land. They must first step on my body if they want our land.\" (solemn face)Little Yi: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter Robb finished his passionate words, he waved to Little Yi and said, \"Little Yi, take the townspeople willing to evacuate and go. I will not withdraw from the front line until I see the last of the people retreat safely. If the town\u2019s defenses are breached before everyone manages to withdraw, I will hold the enemy's legs and will not let them catch up.\" (solemn face)Little Yi thought to herself, \u201cHe is obviously saying something selfless, but why do I want to find a piece of bacon to slap him in the face? Am I just immature?\u201dThe mayor raised his hand and said, \"I'm willing to stay, too! I was moved by the priest's spirit. I\u2026 I will defend the town to the death, too.\"The mayor has all his wealth here, and if he withdraws to Bright Road, he will lose a lot. He thought that since the priest was willing to stay, he certainly wanted to fight as well.Robb gave the mayor a thumbs-up, \u201cVery good! Since you are willing to stay, let's take action. I'll defend the city in my way. As for you, go and do some ordinary preparatory work. I think Mr. Mayor should be better at guarding the city than I am as a priest.\u201dRobb smiled and said, \"good, I like you.\"The mayor rushed out of the chapel and rang the bell in the center of the town. Soon after, the whole town was called to the center of the town. After the mayor made an impassioned speech, more than 100 townspeople decided to withdraw to Bright Road. But most of the townspeople decided to stay and defend their hometown to the death.Robb saw the strength of ordinary people in the Middle Ages. The townspeople, who were usually submissive in front of him, went back to their houses, and when they came out, they were fully clothed and dressed in chainmail, some even dressed in plate armor.Mining is one of the core industries in Westwind Town. So for the people here, armor is so cheap that anyone can afford it.In addition, there are a large number of hunters because herbalism and hunting are also the core of Westwind Town. They are the ones that have to fight the monsters on the mountain at any time, so there are many hunters. These hunters are all archers. Although there is still a certain gap compared to a regular army, it is much better than the townspeople who only do agriculture.Robb found that the townspeople who wanted to evacuate were people who engaged in agriculture...Under the command of the mayor, the townspeople began to build fortifications. They found many large stones and placed them behind the town wall to reinforce it. Some people built tall wooden towers as sentries on the four corners of the town and appointed people with good eyesight to scout.The preparations were carried out nervously and methodically. The villagers who wanted to evacuate packed their bags and went to the town's east gate, and hurried along the official road. Little Yi also promised a sum of money to the three adventurers and asked them to escort the townspeople back to Bright Road.What Robb didn't expect was that Little Yi would stay.Seeing the nun in a blue dress standing in front of him again, Robb could not help saying, \"Didn\u2019t you want to evacuate?\"\"I advocate retreat, but that doesn't mean I will.\" Little Yi said coldly, \"the townspeople can go back, but I can't! I am a nun of the God of Light, and I must fight to the death with the believers of the God of Darkness. \"Robb applauded and rolled his eyes, \u201cIt\u2019s remarkable that someone who was sent to spy on me would say such a glorious thing.\u201dLittle Yi, \u201cNo! Although spying on you is a very important task given to me by the archbishop, it is not because of this that I am willing to stay. You should not underestimate the determination of a nun.\u201d\u201cYes, yes, right, I believe you.\u201d Robb said with a smile, \"next, you should keep a good watch because once I start playing tower defense, the things you\u2019ll get to see are guaranteed to be dazzling, and you may not be able to see them and may not be able to keep up.\"Little Yi spread her hand, \"I would never take a pen to write in a fierce battle such as this.\"Early the next morning, Westwind Town was awakened by a burst of alarm bells. The man on the southwest sentry tower shouted desperately, \"Someone\u2019s coming!\"The nervous townsmen immediately flocked to the southwest corner, along with Little Yi. Robb was too lazy to go. He sat on a big tree in the chapel and activated detection with a range of 5000 yards, which was enough for him to have a panoramic view of Westwind Town.It was not the army of the undead coming from the southwest but the refugees from the birch forest. A group of hunters protected the team, dragging their children. More than 300 people flocked to the gate of Westwind Town.The sentry on the wall shouted, \"Are you being followed by the undead?\"The mayor of Birch Town exclaimed, \"there are pursuers, but not many! Quickly, open the gate and let us in. The pursuers are almost here. \"The sentry was startled and hurriedly opened the door, and the refugees poured in.When the sentry closed the town gate, a group of skeletons appeared in the southwest, but the number was not large. These were the ones who chased the refugees from the birch forest to here, not to attack Westwind town. They stood in the woods of the southwest, looked at the heavily guarded Westwind town from a distance, gave up their plans to attack, and retreated to the mountains.Everyone sighed in relief!Then, more than 300 refugees flocked to the chapel.Robb watched helplessly as the group of people rushed towards his home from a few kilometers away from a distance of 5000 yards and couldn't help saying, \"what the heck? Why are the refugees coming to my house?\"Lillian, who was under the tree Robb was on, said, \"Master, isn't it natural for refugees to seek refuge in a church or chapel?\"\"Oh, my God! Go to the mayor for me.\u201d Robb fell from the tree and almost landed on his face, \"Mother, Why is being a priest so tiring? I\u2019m also in charge of caring for the refugees? I'm going to resign. I'm going to resign right now, right now!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although he\u2019s happy to be everyone's father, he doesn\u2019t like being troubled by his sons.Now, more than three hundred refugees have come to the clearing outside the chapel, looking helplessly at Robb, and a few more exaggerated ones, kneeling outside the courtyard, worshiping, \"Baldr, Oh generous God of Light, merciful Father, please help us.\"Robb didn't know what to say for a moment.However, Little Yi moved quickly and immediately let the refugees in and let them enter the chapel hall to have a rest. But how could the hall of this town chapel accommodate more than 300 people? in the end, only a small number of old and weak women were able to enter the hall. The men stayed in the yard and sat on the ground.The atmosphere seemed depressing and heavy.The mayor of the White Birch Forest came to Robb, first saluted him deeply, and then said, \"Dear Father, we have caused you trouble.\"Robb was depressed but maintained basic etiquette, \u201cIt is nothing!\u201d\"The townspeople were chased by the undead and are tired of running.\" The mayor said, \"Please allow us to have a rest here for a day. We will leave early tomorrow morning for Bright Road.\"Robb nodded. \"En!\"Little Yi said, \u201cDo you have any food?\u201dWhite Birch Mayor shook his head heavily, \u201cWe only realized that the enemy was close when the army of the undead attacked. We didn't have the time to prepare. Most of the townspeople ran out of their houses without having time to pack anything. Then we were chased by skeletons all the way here. We've been running for several days. Many only drank a few mouthfuls of water and ate nothing. \"On hearing this, Robb began to tell himself desperately, \u201cYou are not Virgin Mary, you are not Virgin Mary, you don't have to meddle in this kind of thing, if you take care of this thing, you can\u2019t be lazy.\u201dAfter telling himself repeatedly for a while, he felt that his heart had become as hard as steel and could completely ignore the prayers of the refugees.At this time, a little Loli began to cry among the refugees, \"Mom, I'm hungry.\"Her mother could only touch her head with one hand and said bitterly, \"Mom has no food to give you, be patient... After the skeleton monsters outside go away, mother will go to the woods to dig wild vegetables for you to eat. \"However, the little loli is still too young to be sensible, and even though her mother tried to appease her, she still cried loudly.Robb, who has a heart of steel, sighed, \"Lillian! Go and take all the food out of the chapel reserves, cook a big stew, and give each of the refugees a bowl. \"Lillian said awkwardly, \"Master, although we have a lot of food in stock if we feed so many people, we will have nothing for tomorrow. In the current situation in the town, food will only become more and more difficult to acquire.\u201d\"Stupid.\" Robb tapped her on the forehead, \"Leave some potatoes. I'll plant them later.\"Lillian suddenly understood, \"Oh, that's right! We have the blessings of the God of Light. Haha, that's great!\"She happily ran into the warehouse, left a bag of potatoes, but took out the rest of the chapel\u2019s food reserves, set up a big pot in the yard, and cooked a big stew.Lillian is good at making stew, no matter the ingredients boiled in the pot. All kinds of strange ingredients rolled in the pot, and after a while, the smell of \"delicious\" wafted in the air.As soon as the refugees smelled the fragrance, they could not help craning their necks, and the crying little loli suddenly stopped crying. She opened her eyes wide and looked pitifully at the pot in the yard.But Robb stopped lying on the stool, covered his nose, waving and shouting, \"Quickly distribute it! Hurry up. I can't stand it. \"The White Birch mayor could not help sighing. \"Sir priest is so kind. Although he wanted to eat, he covered his mouth and walked away. He could hardly bear the hunger and only asked the maid to give us the food as soon as possible. Where can we find such a good priest?\"Little Yi, \u201cHow come I feel like it\u2019s not what you think?\u201dBut that's not the point. The thing is, no one is in the mood to complain.Lillian called the refugees over and gave each of them a bowl. Some of the people who escaped brought bowls, but some brought nothing, so they had to spread large pieces of leaves on their hands. Those that used leaves had to forcibly put up with their slightly burnt hands, unwilling to spill the little food they had.Robb's \"steel heart\" began to ache again, and he sighed, \"Damn it, why do I have to see this picture? Isn't this just attacking my conscience? Although my conscience is indestructible, it will turn soft if I suffer too much. Forget it. These guys are going to Bright Road tomorrow. I'll just put up with it.\"He was swearing when he saw the three adventurers running over in a panic. As soon as they saw Robb and Little Yi, they shouted, \"Mr. Robb, Miss Sister, something big is going to happen!\"Robb said angrily, \"what now?\"Gorda said rapidly, \"We escorted more than 100 townspeople last night, intending to evacuate them to Bright Road. Unexpectedly, before long, we found that Nanli Village in the southeast had been occupied by the army of the undead, and the number was huge. It was a large army of the undead, and there were even high-level undead creatures such as skeletal dragons. We had no way to leave the village through the south, so we had to protect the townspeople and return.\"Nanli Village is a small village between Westwind Town and Bright Road, with a small population of only more than 100 people. The village is so small that it is not even marked on the map, but the location of this village is very important. It is the only way to go to Bright Road from Westwind Town.Now, Nanli Village has also been occupied by a huge army armed with skeletal dragons.Xiao Yi's face immediately sank, \"that is to say, the enemy hoarded a large number of troops, forcibly cutting off the connection between Bright Road and the villages and towns on the western border. Westwind town has become an island town.\u201dGorda nodded heavily.The face of the White Birch mayor changed greatly, \u201cThen\u2026 what should we do?\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t leave anymore.\u201d The mayor of Westwind town came out of nowhere and said with a bitter face, \"just stay in Westwind town and get ready to defend the town with us.\"Robb sighed and looked up at the sky, \u201cMy lazy life is getting further and further away from me. How could the peaceful day yesterday turn into a war the next day? If a war starts, I won\u2019t be able to sell my stockings, pepper, and Coca-Cola.\u201d\"Don't panic, everyone.\" Xiao Yi stood out and exclaimed, \"right now, we can\u2019t leave for the outside. The only way is to stick to Westwind Town. We have to believe that the White Lion Cavalry cannot be easily defeated by the undead and that Bright Road won\u2019t fall. As long as we hold on to this town, the reinforcements from Bright Road will certainly come.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In times of war, people in cities and towns surrounded by enemy troops need these words to survive. Without such expectations, the defenders will collapse in an instant.Not to mention the two mayors and Little Yi, even Robb expected reinforcements to come early because although he had the ability to defend the town, it was troublesome to support so many refugees. There was no way he could be lazy.Can I stop being a priest now?He could've done so if he hadn't heard the little loli cry. He could\u2019ve had time to throw in the pot, but he can\u2019t even do that now.\"I wish reinforcements would come to liberate me sooner!\" Robb sighed from the bottom of his heart, \"forget it, no more nonsense. I have to plant the potatoes first. If I plant them a minute earlier, I can harvest them a minute earlier. Lillian, go and get the potatoes I told you to leave behind.\"Lillian returned to the warehouse and took out a basketful of potatoes.The potato itself is the seed, which can be planted only by cutting it into pieces. Robb asked Lillian to cut the potatoes into small pieces, then took them and walked to the side of the field.At this time, many refugees from White Birch were sitting next to the fields, and there was a bewildered look in the eyes of the many refugees when they saw Robb holding a basket of potatoes to plant in the field.Little Yi didn't know that Robb could farm fast, so she couldn't help coming out and asking, \"Father, you suddenly want to grow potatoes at such a time? Why?\u201d\u201cFor a harvest!\u201d Robb said, \u201cHow can you harvest anything if you don\u2019t plant?\u201d\"Distant water cannot put out an ongoing fire, so if you plant potatoes now, you might as well keep them as food reserves.\" Little Yi said, \"now that Westwind Town has become isolated, every grain is extremely precious.\"\"It is because I know that food is precious that I need to grow it.\" Robb smiled and said, \"Is this my chapel or yours? You, a little nun who has been demoted from a big city to a small town, is not allowed to have any objection to a priest's operations, just follow me, or next time you won't even be allowed to stay in this town. We\u2019ll transfer you to a small village.\u201d\"I didn't get demoted!\" Little Yi protested.After her protest, she didn\u2019t object to Robb\u2019s actions anymore. Robb, a super lazy man, did not instruct Lillian to work anymore and even refused the refugees' assistance and did it himself. He dug a small hole in the field, buried a potato, and then repeated that process.He repeated it dozens of times until the whole field was full. He patted the dust on his hands and said, \"Lillian, kettle!\"Lillian answered obediently, handing over the little kettle that had already been prepared.Little Yi smiled bitterly and said, \"Lillian, you are also playing around with your master.\"Lillian winked, \u201cMaster is not fooling around. The miracle of the God of Light is on him. As long as he grows the crops himself, it only takes one day to harvest.\"Little Yi didn\u2019t believe a word, \u201cBullshit.\u201dBut the mayor of Westwind next to her also said, \"the priest really carries the miracle of the god of light. You will understand when you get up tomorrow morning.\"Even the mayor said such strange things? Little Yi was a little surprised, but this made her believe it a little.After watering the field, Robb turned to look at the refugees sitting on the ground in the courtyard. Three hundred refugees here have to open their mouths to eat every day. If the state of war continues, the original thousand residents of Westwind Town may have a food crisis, plus nearby villages may also have refugees coming one after another.I'm afraid this small piece of land in the chapel is insufficient.He exclaimed, \"I need a batch of people to help me clear uncultivated land for cultivation. Well, just the hillside next to the cemetery. After clearing up the land, we will extend the yard's fence and wrap the newly claimed fields into the chapel yard. Is there anyone who wants to volunteer? \"He had just given food to the refugees, and the refugees were grateful. Immediately a large group of men, sixty to seventy in number, sprang out. A few of them received simple farm tools from Lillian, but many more could not even get them, so the mayor of Westwind Town hurriedly went back to the town to borrow a lot of farm tools so that all the sixty and seventy people were equipped.With so many people working together, the speed of clearing uncultivated land for cultivation is, of course, extremely fast, and within a few hours, a large area of land has been made ready for planting on the hillside.The carpenters from White Birch also built fences for the field.Because White Birch Town is a small forest town, logging is its most important industry, and almost every one of the townspeople is good at carpentry. They quickly cut down a pile of wood, built a wooden fence, and surrounded all the fields that had just been cultivated. In this way, the land became a part of the chapel.After the men had finished the task given by Robb, they ran from the hillside, and before they could claim their credits to Robb, they heard the exclamations of women and children in the yard.They looked down curiously and saw more than a hundred old and weak women from White Birch town encircling the small reserved area of the chapel, all looking inside.The curious men squeezed in to join the party!They were surprised to find that the potatoes Robb had planted in the field a few hours ago had sprouted, and the plants on the ground had grown so sturdily that they looked as if they had been growing for months.\"What's going on?\"\"Oh, my God! How did these potatoes grow so fast? \"\"It's only been a few hours. Why does it look like it's been growing for months?\"\"If it keeps growing at this pace, it\u2019ll be ready for harvest in a day.\"\"In what strange way did you plant it?\"Seeing the inexplicable surprise of this group of country bumpkins from White Birch Town, the mayor of Westwind Town felt pride. While laughing, he walked over arrogantly and shouted, \"see? Hahaha! This is the great miracle of Westwind Town. Father carries the grace of the God of Light. As long as the crops are planted by him, they can be harvested in one day. Why don't you quickly thank God and Father? \"The townspeople of White Birch Town were stunned and hastened to worship together, praising the God of Light and Father.Of course, this is the right action. But Little Yi was one that was truly surprised!The \"miracle\" shown by Robb is amazing. How much favor does it take from the God of Light to do this? She had never seen a priest so blessed by the God of Light in the Church of Light.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

More than 10 hours later, the potatoes grew. And in the eyes of the people of White Birch, everything became green.Of course, the ones planted on the hillside are still very young. They were planted towards evening and are still quite small. However, there are much more potatoes planted there than in the small field in the chapel, and by tomorrow evening, the harvest will be absolutely amazing.Looking at the miraculously grown potatoes, the people from White Birch Town were relieved as they realized that they didn't need to worry about a food shortage. As long as they had these miraculous potatoes, they didn't have to worry about being hungry.They calmed down, but Robb was unhappy.Usually, he\u2019d put a big wooden tub in the yard, soaking in the warm water, looking at the stars all over the sky, and feeling the comfortable night breeze, with his little maid talking to him from time to time and a cold-faced nun retorts him. A feeling that makes him feel as happy as an immortal.Occasionally he would deliberately make a move to jump out of the bathtub so as to frighten Little Yi to the point her face turned pale, and then she\u2019ll call him a rascal and so on.But not today. The chapel hall was full of old and weak women from White Birch, and the courtyard was littered with men lying on the floor.In this case, Robb is definitely willing to take a bath in the yard!It doesn't matter if the women from White Birch see him. He's thick-skinned, so he can bear it.But donkeys will yell \"Gay! Gay!\" if those men see him. Who can stand that?In desperation, Robb had to move the bathtub into his room, where it was boring. He can only see the ceiling if he looks up, and only through a small window can he see the stars.The most outrageous thing was that Lillian could not be with him because there were many old and weak women outside, Lillian was eager to help take care of them, and there was no way for her to stand beside Robb all the time.Robb is very unhappy!Soaking in the bath, the water was a little cold. He patted the bathtub's edge and shouted, \"Lillian, the water is getting cold. Please add some hot water for me.\"After several calls, the door opened, but it was not Lillian who came in but Little Yi. She walked to the bathtub with a pot of hot water and slowly added it to the bathtub's edge.Robb asked, \u201cLittle Yi, how come it\u2019s you? Where\u2019s Lillian?\u201dLittle Yi said, \"Lillian is helping a mother with her child, so she can't leave for a while. I\u2019ll heat the water for you.\"\"Oh!\"Little Yi seemed to want to say something, but she couldn't say it. It took a long time for her to whisper, \"Is it really because of the grace of the God of Light that you have the miracle of one-day harvest?\"Robb was stunned by the question, then smiled and asked, \"what do you think?\"Little Yi shook her head and said, \"I don't know! At first, I was so shocked that I almost got down on my knees to praise the God of Light, but I thought about it for a while and felt something was wrong. Does the God of Light really take care of anything related to agriculture? This, from a reasonable point of view\u2026 should be handled by Sif, the Goddess of Grain and Fertility.\u201dRobb couldn't help rejoicing that there was such a goddess. I've never heard of her! I don't know if she is beautiful or not.However, it doesn't matter whether she\u2019s beautiful or not. He can\u2019t see her anyway. He smiled and said, \"what on earth are you trying to say?\"\u201cI\u2026 I just want to say that the longer I spend with you, the more I find that you don't seem to be a true believer in the God of Light. The archbishop said he didn't know there was a heretic judger like you. He wrote to the pope asking about you. I believe it won't be long before the Pope's reply will be sent to Bright Road\u2026 At that time\u2026.\"Seeing her hesitating, Robb smiled and said, \"what will happen then? The archbishop will send someone to kill me?\"Little Yi sighed, \"I hope it will not end up like that, but seeing that you are less and less like a real priest, I am worried that things will go on in this direction.\"Robb's face smiled even happier. \"Thank you very much for telling me about it. Why are you helping me like this? Now that you disobeyed the order of the archbishop. If I am really a fake priest and run away now, the people sent by the archbishop will not be able to catch me. Won't he just take it out on you? You might get another demotion.\"Little Yi once agian put on a cold face, \"How are you still in the mood to joke when it's like this? If you were really a fake priest, you would run away when you heard what I said, yet you dared to joke with me about demotion.\u201d\"I'm not running now. I'm still in the mood to joke, which means I'm a little real.\"Robb didn't lie. Didn't he really practice the priest class in the game? It's just that he was a priest who didn't belong to the Church of Light.Little Yi was confused by his strange attitude. At first, the guy looked like a priest, and then he looked less and less like one. Yet he was so calm even after she revealed that the archbishop was investigating him. He has the \"I'm not afraid of the archbishop's investigation\" expression, which makes him look like a real priest again.Can\u2019t see through! I can\u2019t see through him at all!Robb smiled and said, \"Little Yi, I want to ask you a question. From the bottom of your heart, do you want me to be a real priest or a fake priest?\"\"I hope you are real!\" Without thinking about it, Little Yi replied, \"so you don't have to run, and so you can continue to be a priest here. Because, although you have all kinds of problems, I can see that you have a kind heart. You are kind to the townspeople of Westwind Town, to the soldiers of the Baron, to the refugees from White Birch Town. Although you occasionally show an impatient and unwilling expression, you are still doing the right thing. \"She sighed, \"You're obviously lazy to death and don't even want to move, but today you sow potatoes one after another. That action has been repeated hundreds of times, sowing all the fields on the hillside just so that the refugees and the townspeople of Westwind Town will not go hungry when surrounded by the undead. In fact, even if you do not do this, no one will blame you because no one knows that you are carrying God's miracle. You just need to say nothing to avoid such trouble! But you did it anyway, and you were willing to put aside your laziness in order to help others. You are a really kind person. I hope I can do something for the world with people like you. I sincerely hope that you are a real priest.\u201d\"Is that so? Is that what you think?\" There was a sunny smile on Robb's face, \"All right! I\u2019ve decided! I must become a real priest. Even if I'm fake, I'm going to force myself to show you that.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I have accumulated a lot of good reputation for the Church of Light, right? For a priest like me who can help the God of Light spread his teachings, I think the Pope or the Archbishop would be more than happy to give me a position.\u201dOf course, this is only a superficial statement, and Robb also knows that it is not so easy to enter, so he added in his heart that if they do not agree, he could beat them and force them to make arrangements. Isn\u2019t that simple?He remembered that there was a man named Sun WuKong who forced himself into an official position with a big stick.Robb thinks he can follow suit.It's just that Sun WuKong is a very hard-working person, but Robb is very lazy. He doesn\u2019t mess about until necessary.\u201cLittle Yi, don't worry about it.\" Robb smiled, \"as long as you don't want to be my enemy, we will never be enemies. Well, the same applies to the Church of Light, the Kingdom of Gran, even the necromancers, and everything in the world! If someone doesn\u2019t attack me, I won't attack them. \"With that, he added, \"because I love all things, I am so kind, and I am a faithful follower of the beliefs of the God of Light.\"Little Yi coldly said, \u201cI think you\u2019re just lazy.\u201dRobb, \"Hey, I can still be a good friend, whether you see through it or not.\"Little Yi shook her head, turned, and walked out of Robb's room. As soon as she walked out of the room, her cold expression suddenly melted, and the corners of her mouth raised slightly upward with a smile of delight.The next day, in the morning.At the small private plot in the chapel yard, the first batch of potatoes planted by Robb have been harvested!The refugees from White Birch Town worked together to dig up the batch of potatoes from the ground. The small piece of private land produced thousands of jin (\u65a4) of potatoes, solving the food shortage instantly. Moreover, more potatoes are growing on the newly cultivated land on the hillside.If evening comes, where the hillside batch of potatoes will be harvested, won\u2019t it be tens of thousands of jin?In this way, not to mention the refugees from White Birch Town, even if Westwind Town provided food for nearly a thousand people, there would not be any food pressure at all.The townspeople had already worshiped once yesterday, but today they could not help getting down on their knees again and praising the God of Light and Robb with all their nice words.Robb was not in the mood to accept their praise and worship. He climbed onto the stone table, stood straight, and exclaimed, \"townspeople from White Birch, you first arrived yesterday and are now laying all over my chapel. I didn't complain, but you can't lie down doing nothing, can you? Not to mention that the chapel is becoming messy. Isn't it painful to sleep like that? Don't your legs hurt? Do you have peace of mind?\"At this point, he paused, looked at the blank expressions on the refugees' faces, and then added, \"this invasion of the undead will not take only a day or two. As far as we know, many villages and towns nearby are occupied by the army of the undead, and the only way to Bright Road is blocked by the undead. And it is said that even skeletal dragons have appeared. \"The refugees exclaimed, \"Skeletal Dragon? My God!\u201dRobb said, \"therefore, you must be mentally prepared for a long-term war. If this war lasts for months or even years, will you lie in my chapel for years and live on my support?\"The townspeople whispered and soon came to a conclusion. The mayor of White Birch looked up and exclaimed, \"My Father, if this will be a long war, of course, we can't live like garbage. Please show us the way.\"Robb coughed and said, \"I heard that White Birch Town is a village with logging and hunting as its main industries. You are all excellent carpenters. Building a cabin should be a piece of cake for you, right? Look, on the hillside behind my chapel, there are a lot of black pine trees. Cut it down! Build wooden houses and go hunting. And then, like your life back in White Birch, take root here for a while. There are no tools I can lend to you for the time being, but without spirit and only laziness, God will not save you. \"Everyone from White Birch Town was reinvigorated and felt motivated in spirit and soul.However, Little Yi and the adventurers couldn\u2019t help shrugging and thought, \u201cit always feels unconvincing if Father Robb says stuff like this. Isn\u2019t he the representative of laziness?\u201dThe mayor of White Birch asked weakly, \"Father, you speak very well, but \u2026 war can happen at any time, those ferocious undead may come at any time, we. Can we really try to build homes under such circumstances? The houses that we build might get burned down by the undead in an instant.\u201dRobb suddenly put on a serious face, \" I'll deal with the undead army. You just need to try to get your lives back on track.\"With that, he added in a low voice, \u201cWork quickly, don't stay in my house all day.\"Such a guarantee is obviously not very relieving.Although the refugees have seen Robb show miracles. They did not believe that Robb could fight the army of the undead.When there is an external threat that may come at any time, it is very difficult for human beings to cheer up and build homes. They can't help thinking, \u201cwhat's the use of building wooden houses now? As soon as the army of the undead comes, they\u2019ll burn down the newly built houses and drive us out. We can't even say that we'll survive the attack\u2026.\"Under the influence of this kind of thinking, no one can return to normal.Just then, bells suddenly rang on the sentry tower in the northwest of the town, and then, from the northwest corner, the townspeople shouted in horror, \"The army of the undead is coming. They\u2019re here!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Hope my mistakes didn\u2019t bother you guys much :\u2019)To the northwest of Westwind town, an official road winds its way to the Stone Canyon along the foot of the Black Pine Mountain Ranges.On this road, a group of people from Stone Canyon were dragging their children and running away in panic. Their number is small, only about 30 people. A lot of people simply didn\u2019t manage to escape.Behind these more than 30 refugees was a large army of undead, who not only occupied the official road but also marched densely in the mountains and forests on both sides of the official road, and the huge army chased the more than 30 refugees. The picture is almost heart-stirring.A skeleton archer bent its bow and shot an arrow at the townspeople who fled in front of him.The arrow darted through the air and hit a townsman in the thigh.He fell to the ground, rolled twice, and then crawled desperately forward. However, the skeletons still caught up to him and stepped on his back with their bony feet.The armed men at Westwind Town couldn\u2019t bear the scene and covered their eyes with their hands.When they finally moved their hands away, the army of the undead had already passed the place where the townsman had fallen, and they could only see a vast expanse of skeletons. They couldn\u2019t even tell whether the townspeople were dead or alive.The mayor of Westwind went up the wall and asked the hunter next to him loudly, \"Can you figure out how many skeletons there are?\"\"No less than two thousand!\"The mayor immediately understood, \"it is the army of the undead the adventurers saw. They have ruined Stone Canyon and are now coming to Westwind Town.\"\"Damn it! Go and call the priest and nun.\u201d\"Those three adventurers are also powerful forces. Ask them to come as well.\"\"Is there any way to save the people from Stone Canyon?\"\"Go out on horses, get them on the horse and rush back.\"\"It's too dangerous!\"\"No matter how dangerous it is, they can be saved.\"There is always no shortage of kind and upright people in this world. Several good equestrian townspeople opened the town's gate, rushed out, galloped their horses on the official road, and rushed to the refugees. They stretched out their hands and put several women who could no longer run on their horses. Then they turned their horses and ran back to Westwind Town.A skeleton archer behind them drew its bow, but the arrow was not strong enough and fell slightly behind the horse.After several more rescues, the last of the more than 30 townspeople from Stone Canyon was finally rescued. Westwind Town quickly closed the town gate and blocked it with boulders. Hundreds of armed men were lined up on both sides of the town wall.However, the skeleton army still hasn't taken true action in the first round. Soon, the no less than two thousand skeletons formed a formation of two arrows. Behind the formation, a necromancer in a cloak, riding a skeleton horse, looked at the wall of Westwind Town from a distance.The army exuded dark magic, and an aura of fear stretched out, vaguely affecting their surroundings. The creatures in the forest had already run because of the aura of fear, and neither goblins nor ogres dared to poke their heads out.\"Sure enough, Westwind Town is the most populated town on the western border, and it looks the most decent.\" The necromancer murmured, \"Prepared to defend the city? Jiejiejie. I'm not as stupid as number 32. He underestimated his enemy, so I\u2019ll just slowly come and play with this town.\u201dWhile the necromancer stood in the distance looking at Westwind Town.Robb, Little Yi, Gorda, Jike, Xuelu, and even Lillian came to the northwest corner of town.As soon as Lillian arrived, she greeted the thirty refugees. Glancing at them, she immediately found an acquaintance in the crowd and hurriedly leaned over, \"Uncle Johnny! Have you seen my aunt?\"The man known as Johnny was a sturdy middle-aged man. When he saw Lillian, he obviously froze. He didn't seem to expect to see Lillian here. Moreover, she was wearing a beautiful skirt, white stockings, and leather shoes, all clean. He looked at Lillian, who looked completely different from the last time he saw her, and said, \"Didn't your aunt sell you to a slave merchant? \"\"Yes, I was sold to Westwind Town to work in the chapel here.\" Lillian said quickly, \"But that doesn't matter. Where's my aunt? Didn't she escape?\"Uncle Johnny turned pale and said, \"I'm sorry! When\u2026 when I escaped, I saw your aunt's family surrounded by skeletons\u2026.\"Lillian cried \"ah\u201d and turned pale.Uncle Johnny sighed, \"Lillian, you\u2026 Even considering what your aunt did to you\u2026 you\u2019re still worried about her? You are such a good girl. If your aunt were alive and saw the look on your face, she would have regretted what she had done to you.\u201d\"Ooh.\" Lillian fell to her knees slowly, tears across her face, \"although my aunt often beat me, she is my last relative.\"Robb came over and gently touched the top of her head, \"Don't cry! Am I not your relative? \"In the anime, as soon as the protagonist says this sentence, the recipient is moved, but in fact, such rough comfort is useless and doesn't help stop the girl's grief. She knelt on the ground, crying, tears sprinkling everywhere.He asked some townsmen to take care of Lillian, and then he took Little Yi, the three adventurers, and the two mayors to the town wall and looked at the army of the undead from a distance.All the townspeople who could fight in Westwind Town had stood neatly on the town wall. The refugees from White Birch Town also had to join, and dozens of hunters stood on the wall, all wielding their longbows.However, although their positions were sturdy and ready, their eyes were full of fear. No one thought the battle could be won.\u201cIt still feels like playing tower defense.\u201d Robb angrily said, \u201cThe upper management have already tried their best to avoid this situation. They didn't even hesitate to make a spell using all the magic knowledge they had so that these undead don\u2019t disturb the Kingdom of Gran or the Church of Light. As a result, these hollow-eyed bastards came here to disturb my lazy life.\u201d\"Hmm? Father, what are you talking about? \"The mayor of Westwind Town, who stood beside him, said, \"You were speaking too silently. I didn't hear it clearly.\"\"It\u2019s alright.\" Robb put on a serious face, \"I'm just praying to the God of Light.\"As the two were talking\u2026A voice was suddenly from outside the town. It turns out that it was the necromancer who had spoken, and he had used some sort of magic to spread his voice to the town using the two arrows formation. His gloomy voice seemed to come from all directions, \"listen, people of Westwind and White Birch Town, you are surrounded. You don't have to fight to the death because our purpose is not to destroy and kill but to occupy and dominate. As long as you kill the priests and nuns in the city and swear allegiance to me, I will not kill you! \"As soon as these words came out, countless eyes were moved from the ground and locked onto Robb and Little Yi simultaneously.Robb looked left, right, front, and back, then pointed at his nose, \"Why are you targeting me?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Just now, when I heard the necromancer, I wanted to rush out and beat him, but after hearing your words, my anger was relieved. I only felt sympathy and understanding. Isn\u2019t it strange that I\u2019m sympathizing with the enemy?\u201dLittle Yi: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dRob looked at the townspeople and said with a smile, \"all right, I'll just stand here and see how many townspeople will come and try to chop me up to take my head out to surrender.\"Human nature was complicated, so it\u2019s no surprise that Robb thought that someone would jump out and try to kill him. However, in fact, it proved that he thought too highly of human nature and that the simple townspeople were not ungrateful or treacherous.As soon as his voice fell, one of the townspeople shouted, \"Father had treated me before and sent me pepper trees. If anyone dares to hit Father Robb, I will be the first to fight him.\"\"Father also treated my injuries and, in return, only asked me to do trivial things for him with a high salary, which made it clear that he was deliberately helping me gather wealth. I\u2019ll also stand with father to the death.\u201d\u201cFather made me Coca-Cola. If I can\u2019t drink that anymore, I\u2019d rather die.\u201d\u201cRight! Father is good to us. I have become a devout believer in the God of Light because of Father. I will never betray the light and join the darkness.\u201dAt first, only a few spoke, but soon, they merged into a torrent. Finally, nearly a thousand people from Westwind Town shouted in unison, \"We\u2019ll fight together with Father to resist the enemy!\"This time, Robb found that they did not put the word \"God of Light\" in front of him but mentioned him directly. That was progress.It turns out that the townspeople usually put the God of Light first because of necessity, but now that it's a do-or-die matter, they have no spare power to tell lies. When they only say what they really think in their hearts, they directly ignore the God of Light.They had long been used to having a lazy priest in the town. He was part of the town to them, their friend, and their family. He's their father who often took care of them and guided them. They would never betray Robb. This has nothing to do with the God of Light.The refugees from White Birch Town did not know much about Robb and were not as loyal to Robb as the people of Westwind Town. They looked at the scene in surprise and thought, [How much do the people of Westwind Town like this priest?] (TL: Due to a previous comment, I\u2019ll put all things said in mind/thoughts in [] to emphasize them more)They thought. They thought about the good things they\u2019d seen Robb do so far. He had harvested a field of potatoes in one night. He had miracles. Following his words, perhaps they could really survive the war.It\u2019s too risky to betray him and surrender to a random necromancer whose character they don\u2019t even know.Robb waited for a long time. In the end, no one came to kill him. All the townspeople were on his side, which made him happy in body and mind.That's right, there are more beautiful things and upright people in the world.This kind of world looks lovely! It makes me want to protect it.Robb could not help laughing, like a child in full bloom, \"everyone is good, well, now that you all say so, then I will keep everyone safe.\"Gorda leaned over and whispered, \"Mr. Robb, there are more skeletons outside than the last saw. You see, there are not only skeleton soldiers inside, but even skeleton knights in armor. There are also skeletal horses, skeletal dogs, and other kinds of undead. Without the Baron and his more than a hundred trained soldiers on our side, Not to mention that we can\u2019t draw a large Holy Light Sanctuary. I am afraid it will not be easy to protect so many people.\u201dXuelu also whispered, \"you might as well shoot the necromancer with a tracking arrow.\"Without saying a word, Jike handed over his bow.Robb smiled, \"No, it's no fun to use a bow. I was in a hurry to go home to make stockings last time, so I hastened to kill the necromancer, but this time was different. The enemy came to my door and forcibly pulled me out of my state of laziness. I wouldn't be named Robb if I didn't hang him from my ceiling fan and beat him.\"He sat down on a small wooden stool on the town wall and used a bard's skill, \"Sound of Nature,\" which allowed his voice to spread far away and make it sound beautiful. \"Listen to me, necromancer,\" he said. \"You are surrounded. Now put down your weapon and surrender. I guarantee that the ceiling fan will only open to 3rd gear. If you continue to fight stubbornly, I'm going to turn the ceiling fan on to fifth gear.\u201d\u201cF**k!\u201d The necromancer scowled, \u201cWhat nonsense are you talking about?\u201d\"Oh? Are you going to announce the breakdown of the negotiations?\" Robb said with a smile, \"I\u2019m warning you that if negotiations break down, I will be very angry and the consequences will be dire. I\u2019ll count from ten. If you don\u2019t surrender, I will beat you. Ten... Nine\u2026\"\"Are you really counting?\" Little Yi and the three adventurers nearby didn't know whether to laugh or cry, \"It'll be surprising if the necromancer really surrenders.\"The necromancer obviously did not believe Robb at all, but he did not rush over rashly. He still remembered that number 32 was killed because he underestimated the enemy. Their leader had also warned him to be careful, so he was still standing behind the two arrow formation. Neither magic nor bow can touch him at this distance.Moreover, there are two majestic and mighty skeleton knights around him. These two skeleton knights were also famous prior to their death. After their death, they were transformed into skeleton knights using necromancy. Although their strength was weakened, they were still far more than ordinary warriors. With these two skull knights guarding him, he was not afraid of any strange tricks.But he did not intend to let Robb count to zero. It would be embarrassing if he really foolishly waited for the other side to count from ten. He waved his skeleton staff forward and shouted, \"team one, attack the town!\"A skeleton group of about five hundred began to rush towards the town wall of Westwind.There was a constant sound of clanging bones and joints, a vast expanse of white round heads, rusty swords, and knives, interspersed with many skeletal archers, who ran, drawing their bows and arrows, ready to suppress the men on the town wall.The mayor of Westwind Town suddenly became nervous and shouted, \"Men, prepare for battle!\"\"Oil Cans! Roll over that log! That big rock, move it over here\u2026.\"\u201cArchers, draw your bows!\u201d\"Soldiers, our town wall is low, so the skeletons will climb over in an instant. Get ready for battle!\"Everyone was ready to fight, and even Little Yi and the three adventurers could not help extending their hands to their own weapons.Just then, Robb suddenly said, \"Stop, sit down. Don\u2019t play with weapons! If you hurt yourself by mistake, I\u2019ll have to treat you later. That\u2019s troublesome. Leave it to me. I\u2019ll play tower defense for such a small-scale battle.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They thought, [Does the priest want to go out and fight 500 skeletons alone?]As a matter of fact, Robb can deal with more than five hundred skeletons, even fifty thousand, as long as he stands at the center of the skeleton army and use holy nova repeatedly or some other large-scale AOE magic such as collapsing sky, meteor rain, doomsday and so on. He only needs to throw a few tricks in.But he won\u2019t bother doing such a troublesome thing, he put one hand on his chin and thought to himself, [Tower defense, of course, starts with the weakest force, but my lowest summons is a skeleton soldier, damn it. If I call a few skeletons here to hack the enemy\u2019s skeletons, the townspeople and Little Yi will be frightened and made to think that I am also a necromancer. Forget it. I'll just skip a few steps. It should be fine\u2026Summoning is generally grotesque, so it is easy to frighten people when doing so. But there are also a few summons that can be accepted by ordinary people: summoning elemental creatures.Robb waved his hand to a clearing outside the town walls \u2013 Summon, Water Elemental!The flat land rippled, freezing everyone. How can land ripple like that?Then, in the astonished eyes of everyone. Right in the center of the rippling land, a large group of water elementals jumped from the ground.Large, it was really large. This group of water elementals is a lot larger than ordinary water elementals. This is, of course, because Robb's power is too high, and his summoner class is also maxed. If he summons an elemental, it'll result in it being large. Moreover, it's more than one group.This sudden development surprised the audiences on both sides.The necromancer looked confused and said, \"what's going on? Does the other party have an Archmage? Or is there a summoner? How did you get such a large group of water elementals?\"While at Westwind Town, Little Yi\u2019s mouth was wide open. The three adventurers were a little less surprised but also looked dazed.Of course, the most surprised are the ordinary townspeople, who were all ready for a bloody battle. They didn't expect that a group of water elementals would suddenly emerge in the middle of a patch of land. It\u2019s outrageous!The place where the water elements jumped out was right in front of the skeletons' attack.The skeletons looked at the sudden group of elemental creatures with their empty eyes and a row of question marks on their foreheads.However, The water elementals were not polite at all. They waved their water column hands decisively. Ice arrows shot out of their palms and shot at the skeletons who rushed in front. The skeletons who were hit by the arrows were instantly frozen in a large piece of ice.The skeletons roared angrily, waved their swords, and rushed to the water elementals.The water elementals didn\u2019t bother to say a word, ice arrow! Ice arrow! Ice Ring! Ice arrow! Ice arrow! Ice ring!Only ice arrows flying all over the sky mixed with ice rings flashing about can be seen.And after a long time, the battle was over.The first wave of the necromancer's skeletons all turned into ice!Only the group of water elementals were left standing on the field, still swaying back and forth.The first wave of the Necromancer's attack failed.Robb sighed, \u201cWell, this is not fun. There is no challenge. It would\u2019ve been interesting if I called out a group of skeletons to fight them first. The best part of tower defense games should be \u2018incoming danger\u2019. Only with that, will it really be fun.\u201dThe necromancer angrily said, \u201cSummoners should have no magic! Team two, attack!\u201dAnother large group of skeletons rushed out. This time, the skeletons were mixed with skeletal warriors with heavy armour, skeletal dogs, and even a few skeletal tigers, skeletal ogres, and other monsters.It turned out that the necromancer not only took over thousands of skeletons from the dead No. 32 but also got a lot of bones of monsters in the wild. The individual combat ability of these monsters is better than that of skeletons, but their number is relatively small.However, the monsters have good synergy with the skeletons.When a water elemental shot an arrow, a skeleton soldier raised its, the shield blocked it but ice formed on it. The skeleton soldier was fine, though. It rolled on the ground to the foot of the water element. It readied its knife and stabbed the water elemental.However, the body of the water elemental is water, so the knife stabbed through it. It slapped the skeleton warrior into a pile of broken bones with a backhand. The skeleton warrior didn't die either and merged again. It even rewore its armor and continues to fight against the water elemental.Robb clapped his hands and uttered his signature exclamation, \"Wow! Their second wave is powerful! My water elemental defenses almost can\u2019t hold up.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re still laughing? Think of something!\u201d Little Yi shouted, \"isn't it time for us to go out and fight?\"\"Don't panic! Water is not the only thing I have,\u201d Robb said.He waved his hand again, and suddenly there seemed to be fire in the clearing in front of the town, and then a large group of fire elementals jumped out of the fire.Everyone: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYou also have this?\u201d\u201cMy GOD! What kind of person is the priest?\u201dThe fire elementals waved their arms, fireball! Fireball! Flame Impact! Fireball! Fireball! Flame Impact!Every fireball is like an incendiary bomb on the body of the skeleton soldiers and immediately burns. Even the dead bones burned easily. The skeleton soldiers rolled desperately on the ground to extinguish the flame. But it\u2019s flame from fire magic. How can it be so easy to extinguish?After a while, the skeletons which had been caught by the fireballs were burned into a pile of ashes. Even if they were undead, they could no longer merge back.Several skeleton soldiers also began to feel the pressure. An ice arrow hit in front of one skeleton soldier, then a fireball hit its back. Even if the skeleton soldier was once a good fighter of Xiaoyong, it couldn\u2019t fight against such a formidable enemy.Before long, several skeletons fell one after another.The second wave of the necromancer's attack failed.The necromancer, who was under pressure because of the battle, was now thoroughly surprised, with a big \"lost\" written on his meatless face, while the townspeople of Westwind Town, who had just been worried about the end of the world, were all like Robb, sitting on the city wall, putting down their weapons and smiling at the scene.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It singlehandedly took out a large group of skeletons.\"\"I think that water elemental here is even stronger. It pressed a skeleton soldier down and beat it.\u201d\"Oh, the fire elemental on this side was cut by a skeleton soldier. Fortunately, its body was made of fire and was not hurt. It scared me to death.\"The people were happy to see such a beautiful battle that they had never seen before.Many people cheered loudly for the elementals! Cheerleaders and moral support groups appeared one after another, and several female townsmen swung their thighs on the city wall to cheer.But the necromancer was unhappy. Seeing his second attack ruined by a bunch of elemental creatures, he could not help but burn with anger, \"these damned elementals, there must be an archmage or summoner in Westwind Town. Ah, summoning so many elementals of water and fire, it's probably not just one magician or summoner. It's a group.\"He did not believe that these things were summoned by Robb alone because no one with a normal IQ would believe it.Summoning is a very rare spell in this world, just like 'transmission' (TL: Transmission or teleport, do tell me which is better T_T). Not to mention summoning so many elementals, even summoning only one requires a very formal ceremony, drawing a summoning array, and consuming a lot of magic. Not to mention needing to sacrifice to successfully summon the creature.A man like Robb, who summons a group of monsters with a wave of his hand, does not exist in this world. Not even the most powerful summoner could do that.Therefore, the necromancer can only assume that there are a large group of summoners, or archmages, hidden in the town.But, so what?Summoning elementals consume a lot of magic. The other party has already summoned two large waves of water and fire elementals. The necromancer does not believe that the other party has enough magic to summon a third wave!This is neither the Capital of Saints nor the Bright Road, not a metropolis with a bunch of elite, but a small town on the border. No matter how exaggerated it already is, there can't be more summoners, right?The necromancer also has a total of more than a thousand undead troops.He felt that if he attacked for the third time, he would definitely win!The necromancer uttered some words, and after a while, the skeleton staff in his hand hit the ground, and the plague immediately spread in all directions.The undead felt the powerful dark magic of the plague and immediately became more ferocious and fearless.\"Go! This is the last wave.\u201d The necromancer loudly ordered, \"take down Westwind town in one fell swoop.\"The skeletons rushed to the front, mingled with countless skeletal warriors, skeletal archers, skeletal tigers, and this time even several skeletal magicians.Although, after becoming undead, their magic power was reduced, the addition of the skeleton magicians undoubtedly makes the whole team have a more rounded combat capability.While the water elemental was fighting a skeleton soldier, a skeleton magician took advantage of the opportunity to cast a spell, a fireball shot into the air, and a \"boom\" exploded on the body of the water elemental. The water on the water elemental\u2019s body and the fireball neutralized each other. Afterward, it let out a silent cry and suddenly turned into ordinary water. It spilled on the ground and then seeped into the ground.On the other side, a fire elemental used a fireball at a group of skeletons. But a skeleton magician on the other side shot an ice arrow at it. It hit the fire elemental! The fire element roared, and its body gradually became smaller. Finally, it turned into a small spark. It flashed and disappeared.The townspeople of Westwind Town and the refugees of White Birch Town exclaimed in unison!The three adventurers were a little restless, and Gorda whispered, \"Let the three of us fight. We\u2019ll kill the skeleton magicians through the cover of the elementals.\"Xuelu said, \u201cIf we don\u2019t kill their magicians, the elementals won\u2019t be able to win.\u201dEven Little Yi couldn't help saying, \"can I heal the elements?\"\u201cObviously not.\u201d Xuelu said angrily, \"elementals aren\u2019t living creatures. What is the use of healing? For them to recover, we need to supplement them with elemental magic. If you go to Loki, the God of Fire, and borrow the power of fire, you may be able to save a few fire elementals. \"Little Yi said with a cold face, \"Loki, the god of fire, is one of the culprits who killed Baldr, the God of Light. How can I borrow some help from him? If I meet him, I will fight him to the end.\"Xuelu shrugged.\"Well, don't panic.\" Robb said with a smile, \"Their offensive is, of course, by wave, and of course, the number of troops defending the town has to be increased one by one. This is the essence of tower defense. To make the enemy feel as if they are about to beat you before setting up a few new towers to barely prevent defeat. This is fun.\u201dAs he spoke, Robb waved his hand again. Now he no longer concealed his strength in the face of Little Yi, so it is easier to play his cards. He used to hide his strength in order to avoid playing tower defense, but now that it started, it seems to have proved useful to shock everyone.With a wave of his hand, a whirlwind blew in the clearing outside the town gate. The whirlwinds swirled and turned in spirals, and at last, they turned into a large group of wind elementals.Then, the ground rumbled, and a large group of square and honest-looking earth elementals appeared from the ground.The earth elementals rushed to the front as soon as they appeared and covered the water and fire elementals with their thick bodies. A skeleton magician shot a fireball over, intending to blow up a water elemental, but the earth elemental went and covered the water elemental.With a bang, the fireball exploded on the earth elemental, yet the simple and honest stone was unharmed, but its chest was a tad bit black.It raised its huge fist and hit a group of skeletons with one blow, causing dozens of skeletons to fly in mid-air.Then the wind elementals moved. They passed by, their whirlwind-like bodies charged at the army of skeletons and suddenly disappeared, and when they re-appeared, they had arrived in front of the skeleton magicians.A large number of sharp blades were released from the hands of the wind elementals. And as if blades were flying all over the sky, the skeleton magicians were cut to pieces in an instant. The skeleton soldier next to a skeleton magician slashed its sword, but it passed through the body of the wind elemental, only to see that the wind elemental turned into a fresh breeze, disappearing without a trace, and then appeared again in the distance in the twinkling of an eye.The townspeople cheered again!\"Great!\"\"The elementals are so powerful, hahaha!\"\"The Elemental army is defeating the undead. Beautiful.\"Little Yi, the three adventurers, and the two mayors looked deeply at Robb, admiring him, but with a touch of surprise in their hearts. They knew he was strong but didn't expect him to be this strong.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What on earth is going on?This kind of place should not be Westwind town. It should be called the West Capital instead, right?How do we even fight such a battle?This is no longer a city that can be captured by a single necromancer with a group of undead troops. I'm afraid it will take a large group of necromancers to confront such a large group of archmages (summoners).The necromancer feels that the problem now is that their side's intelligence is insufficient and misjudged Westwind Town's strength. He has to retreat now, it is useless to continue the attack, and he can only humiliate himself. It seems that he has to gather information about Westwind Town to continue the attack.He looked around and as if a small team commander, he only has two skeletal knights, left and right, riding their skeletal horses to protect him. Of course, the two skeletal knights are still very reliable. They were both famous figures in their lifetime, with strong fighting power and awe-inspiring.The necromancer took a lot of effort to steal them from their tombs to turn them into skeletal knights, but these two guys were so strong-willed that even if they became skeletal knights, there was still a little bit of integrity and goodness in them to fight against his dark magic. He took great pains to completely suppress the souls of the two knights and turn them into his servants.The necromancer thought, [I just won\u2019t send these two knights. They\u2019re not easy to make. I\u2019ll just take them away from here.]Of course, even if he had decided to quit, he would rather die than surrender. And as per the usual, he had to yell at the town at the top of his voice. The loser should always shout, \"Wait for me! I\u2019m coming back,\" to save face.Soon, the necromancer spoke again and said in a gloomy tone, \"Westwind Town is really good. You dared fight even after I gave you a chance to surrender. Don't blame me for being ruthless. Wait for me. When we occupy all the nearby villages and towns and bring the main army, you won't even have a chance to surrender and serve me. I'm going to turn your whole town into zombies, Jiejiejie! \"\"Sure enough, the faces of the townspeople who had just been happy sank again.The necromancer was overjoyed. Did I scare you? Haha!He strangled the reins of his skeletal horse and turned to retreat.Just then, Robb spoke again, using \u2018Sound of Nature\u2019 and made his voice sound through Westwind Town and the battlefield, and only heard him say in a lazy voice, \"Necromancer, have you forgotten what I just told you? You are surrounded. You have no choice but to surrender. Why do you still want to retreat? Do you really expect to go back for reinforcements? Aren\u2019t you being na\u00efve? Now surrender. If you do, I\u2019ll just turn it up to fourth gear. If you fight stubbornly, fifth gear will be your destination.\u201dThe necromancer was angry and turned and roared, \"from the beginning, you have been talking about the third, fourth, and fifth gear of a ceiling fan. What are you even talking about?\"\"You'll know when you\u2019re hanging from it,\" Robb said with a smile.\"Nonsense!\" The necromancer said, \"I, f**k, don't care about you.\"Just then, the skeletal knight, who had been behind the necromancer, like his loyal servant, suddenly strangled its skeletal horse. It approached the necromancer. The two horses stood side by side (TL: The knight\u2019s and the necromancer\u2019s), and then the skeletal knight suddenly threw its fist firmly, hitting the necromancer in the face.The necromancer had no idea that this would happen. He didn\u2019t even make the slightest move to dodge. He was hit by this punch and fell from his saddle. He shook his head on the ground and stood up, looking blankly. Then, he yelled at the skeletal knight, \"What are you doing? You dare to fight your own master?\"As soon as his words fell, another skeletal knight behind him suddenly stepped out and kicked him in the a*s.The necromancer snorted miserably, jumped forward, and again fell like a dog eating its waste.He was so angry that he jumped up and scolded the skeletal knight behind him, \"Are you also overturning the heavens?\"There was a strange spark in the eyes of the two skeletons, and they spoke in a disgusting and annoying tone, \"Wow! Can\u2019t we just overturn the heavens?\"As soon as he heard this, the necromancer felt wronged. Why are these two speaking in such a cheap tone of voice? This style is a bit like the priest who just talked to me from the skies.This is not how these two guys spoke when they were alive. They were very upright knights, and they all spoke in a bold, serious tone.He only heard the two skeletal knights unexpectedly say, \"I told you, you are surrounded, yet you still do not believe me. See, you are surrounded by two knights in front and behind.\"\u201cF**k, that\u2019s impossible.\u201d The necromancer secretly used his dark magic and drilled into the two skeletal knights, trying to feel what had happened to them.His magic poked over but was immediately bounced back by even stronger magic. It turned out that the two skeletal knights had been shrouded in dark magic, more powerful than his own dark magic. No wonder they did not listen to him. Now they belong to a new master.\u201cF**k!\u201d A bead of sweat slowly fell on the necromancer's forehead, \"how does the enemy have a necromancer more powerful than me? This is impossible! The other side is the side of the Church of Light. How can someone there be allowed to believe in the God of Darkness and use dark magic? It is absolute heresy to do so in the territory controlled by the Church of Light. It should\u2019ve long been burned to death and can never be used by the Church of Light. This is absolutely impossible! \"A skeleton knight waved his sword and slashed at the necromancer.The necromancer shook his hand in hurriedly and shot out a bone spear that had already been prepared. With a poof, the skeleton knight was shot cold by the bone spear and scattered all over the ground.The necromancer threw out another prepared magic, but it had to recite a chant for the second. He didn\u2019t have the time to chant before another skeleton knight waved its shield, slamming him. \"Peng\" hit on the necromancer's forehead.The necromancer only felt the sky spinning with stars in his eyes. He fainted to the ground with a puff, knowing nothing.\u201cEnd of Battle, the necromancer is no match for the knights! Even if the opponent is only two skeletal knights who have lost their lives, with their strengths several times lower than before, they can still hang and beat the necromancer.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Look!\u201d Little Yi pointed to a distant part of the battlefield, \"those two skeletal knights suddenly betrayed the necromancer, and the necromancer was knocked down. That\u2019s strange. What happened?\"\u201cAh, it seems to be true.\u201d Gorda was also happy, \"That\u2019s funny. The necromancer seems to have been knocked unconscious. That skeletal knight is quite powerful.\"\"Isn't it strange, though?\" Xuelu said, \"that's his own skeletal knight. It's supposed to be obedient to him. How could it turn against him?\"When the three people said this, they thought of something simultaneously and suddenly looked at Robb with a look of consternation.Little Yi said, \"You\u2026 you did this? No wonder I've been feeling dark magic around me. Did you forcibly take control of those two skeletal knights? \"Robb could tell the truth but didn\u2019t really deem it necessary to do so. Admitting that he can play with skeletons will frighten the people on the side of light. I\u2019ll just fool them then.He said seriously, \"I didn't do such a thing. The dark magic you just felt should have been released by the necromancer on the other side. He may have wanted to play some dirty trick on us. As a result, he didn\u2019t have enough magic to suppress the souls of the two knights.\"He stood up, hands behind his back at 45 degrees, and leisurely said, \"those two knights must\u2019ve been great people when they were alive, but after death, were controlled by the necromancer. Their hearts are full of reluctance and anger. They have probably been trying to use their own will to break away from the grasp of the necromancer, and they finally did; when the necromancers were too focused on fighting us, they seized the opportunity. With their strong will to fight against dark magic, they were finally released from the control of the necromancer. Then they waved their swords of glory and justice and fought for freedom, while! Ah! I admire them. Even if they are dead now, I am full of respect for their deeds.\"As he spoke, the skeletal knight in the distance, who had knocked out the necromancer with its shield, raised its sword and raised it into the sky, then, with a \"wow\" sound, made a backhand attack and stabbed itself in the chest, and then fell slowly.\u201cLook!\u201d Robb pointed to the knight\u2019s slowly falling body and said, \"after defeating the necromancer, it decided to free itself from its body. It wanted to ascend to heaven. That was so great that I was almost moved to tears by its actions.\u201dWith these words, Little Yi also burst into tears. She silently drew a cross on her chest and choked with sobs, \"Truly amazing! However, he has become undead. It cannot die even if it stabs itself. Ah, how pitiful it is. Its soul is stuck in its body\u2026 It's truly pitiful\u2026 I'm going to cast a purification spell on it immediately to help him ascend to heaven. \"Sure enough, it couldn\u2019t die by stabbing itself.In a blink of an eye, the skeletal knight got up from the ground again, carried the necromancer who had fainted on his shoulder, and came over to Westwind Town.By the time the necromancer fainted, the plague was receding, and the undead army was dazed, the elemental army took the opportunity to attack. While it all went on, the skeletal knight carried the necromancer across the battlefield. It\u2019s a wonder how it went unscathed and that no elementals or undead attacked it.In this way, it walked straight to the gate of Westwind town, put the necromancer on the ground, and then it knelt on one knee and stopped moving.\"He\u2026 He is begging us for help\u2026.\"With tears in her eyes, Little Yi chanted a spell of purification. A golden light wrapped the knight. He looked up, as if smiling on its skeleton face, and then something seemed to fly from him and rise into the sky.Afterward, its skeleton body fell to the ground and scattered into a pile of bones.The battlefield slowly quieted down. After the army of undead outside lost their leader, they began to wander aimlessly. The fire elementals threw out countless fireballs, burning all the undead who had lost their leaders to ashes, and afterward, it was time for the elementals to leave.They saluted in the direction of Westwind Town. The wind elementals dispersed into the air; the water elementals crashed like ordinary water; the fire elementals burnt and turned into a little spark that flashed away; the earth elementals slowly sank into the ground.Finally, only an area of ashes remained in the open area outside Westwind Town.The townspeople cheered\u2026\"We won!\"\"Oh, my God, I can't believe we won like this.\"\"It was a piece of cake.\"\"Some only talked. At least I cheered till my throat parched.\u201d\u201cI also shouted Boss 666! Now my throat hurts.\u201d (TL: 666 can mean that everything will go smoothly.)\"My throat is sore, too.\"The historical records of Westwind Town were later recorded as follows, [On August 1344, Westwind Town was besieged by more than 2,000 undead troops led by a high-ranking necromancer. Everyone in town, led by Father Robb, rebelled to their deaths. In this life-and-death battle, a total of 32 townsmen in Westwind town shouted themselves hoarse because they shouted too hard while cheering, making it the most devastating battle to take place In the town for a hundred years.]The townspeople removed the big stones blocking the town gate. Afterward, Gorda went out and brought in the necromancer who had fainted.While Little Yi went to the pile of knights' bones, picked them up with both her hands, and, solemnly and sacredly, carried it to the cemetery behind the chapel, dug a hole, buried them, and erected a monument. It says, \"Here lies a true knight.\"Jike, who was in charge of scouting for any reinforcements, ran back with a man on his back, \"Mr. Robb, I found a man in the woods.\"Everyone looked intently and realized that the man was the one who was caught prior to the start of the battle. After he was shot by the skeleton archer, he was tied by a rope and thrown into the woods.(If you forgot him, please refer to chapter 86)When the mayor saw that the man was still alive, he was satisfied, \"the army of undead didn't kill him! Right, I remember, the necromancer said their purpose is to occupy and dominate, not destroy and kill. In this way, there may be a lot of survivors in the towns occupied by the army of undead.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Apart from the 32 hoarse people, the war did not cause any loss to the town, so Westwind Town returned to usual instantly.The mayor arranged for several armed men to keep watch to let the other townspeople do what they had to do, and then he hurried to the chapel.At this time, the chapel is very lively.White Birch Town's refugees and dozens of refugees from the Stone Canyon have made the chapel as lively as a vegetable market.Robb obviously didn't like the hustle and bustle much. Sitting on the stone stool he usually sat lazily on daily, he directed several townspeople to tie up the necromancer with a rope to hang him on the ceiling fan.When the mayor saw this picture, he seemed confused, \"Father, what are you doing?\"Robb spread his hand and said, \"I promised him that he would enjoy 5th gear of the ceiling fan.\"The mayor didn\u2019t understand, but he's used to it. Words he often doesn't understand pop out of father\u2019s mouth. At these times, don\u2019t ask. Even if you ask, you won\u2019t understand. Just smile.The necromancer was hung up, but the ceiling fan hadn't been turned on yet.Robb smiled and sat down with Little Yi, the three adventurers and two mayors, and countless townspeople forming a circle craned their necks to watch the scene. Everyone wanted to see what Father meant by the 5th gear of the ceiling fan.Only Lillian did not come to watch. She stood sadly beside the pile of refugees from the Stone Canyon. She was obviously worried about her aunt.Robb waved to her, \"Lillian, come here!\"Lillian came over obediently, trying to show Robb a smile, but she couldn't.Robb said, \"Don't worry, we have found that the army of the undead does not kill indiscriminately. They want to occupy and dominate, not to destroy and kill. Your aunt may still be alive.\"\"Ah?\" Lillian's spirit was immediately lifted.But Robb immediately added, \"but it's no use if she's still alive. I saw that the aunt who sold the maid would be beaten to death.\"\u201cHuh?\u201d The expression on Lillian's face immediately darkened again.\"All right, I'm just teasing you.\" Robb sighed a long sigh, \"the poor do everything they can to eat in order to live, and it's not that I haven't heard of such a thing. I won't forgive your aunt. I won't take care of her either. Let's first interrogate the necromancer about the Stone Canyon. \"\"Oh, right, ask the villain if my aunt is still alive.\" Lillian looked left and right and suddenly found the thin bamboo strip that Robb used to draw the spider before. She quickly picked it up and stood under the ceiling fan.Gorda brought a bowl of cold water and threw it in the necromancer's face.The latter woke up and turned around\u2026There was almost no meat on his thin face, and his hollow eyes looked around and found himself hanging from a strange thing, with Robb sitting next to him and a large crowd of onlookers.When he was about to chant, he heard Robb laugh and say, \"Wow, the first thing you do when you wake up is chant? Can you continue chanting? Do you trust that I\u2019d cut you into seventeen or eighteen pieces when you are a second away from finishing?\u201dThe necromancer immediately stopped chanting. He still had to adapt to the circumstances, which is really stupid.Robb said with a smile, \"Now, answer. One wrong answer is third gear, two wrong answers is fourth, and three wrong answers is fifth. Do you understand?\"The necromancer said sadly, \"I understand your mom!\u201d\u201cFirst question, wrong answer!\u201d Robb expressed deep regret for his answer, \"all right, I'll let you try third gear first.\"He put his hand on the magic container and gently pressed the button. The magic container is very interesting, and the speed of releasing the magic inside it can be determined by the force of pressing the button, so Robb can release the magic at half the speed with just a touch.Wind magic stored inside immediately gushed out and blew on the leaves under the tree, which rotated to drive the gears, and finally, the ceiling fan hanging from the tree rotated.The necromancer felt power from the rope from which he was hanging, and then he rotated along with the ceiling fan. The scenery around him began to spin rapidly, and the faces of the townspeople around him changed in an instant.Robb smiled and said, \"Lillian, whip him!\"Lillian had long since wanted to thrash this guy. Her aunt's life or death still fell on this guy. She used the bamboo strip in her hand and whipped the necromancer because the latter was spinning so fast. Lillian didn't know where she hit his body, anyway.The whipping continued\u2026Meanwhile, the townspeople finally understood what was meant by the third gear of the ceiling fan and immediately turned black, thinking, [Father, this move is so scary. We must not make Father angry in the future. It will be really miserable if Father comes with a set of third gear ceiling fans.Twenty seconds later, Robb stopped the ceiling fan.Although it was only going on for 20 seconds, the necromancer did not know how many circles he had turned. He only felt that the sky was spinning and that he did not know where he was. He vomited on his chest, disgusting.Lillian was so frightened that she stepped back quickly for fear of getting the vomit on her body.Robb frowned in disgust: \"He stinks. Someone, wash him.\u201dSeveral refugees from Stone Canyon ran over, splashed buckets on the necromancer, then took a long brush to brush him, and in a blink of an eye, the vomit disappeared, but his black robe was all wet and sticky, looking very uncomfortable.Moreover, these refugees from the Stone Canyon hated him very much because their homes were taken over by the necromancer, so it was inevitable that they hit him with the long brush and so on while washing him.Robb smiled and said, \"what do you think? Was it fun?\u201dThe necromancer felt his brain tremble. His entirety was still spinning, confused about north, south, east, and west, and he said in an uncomfortable tone, \"I\u2026 give up\u2026 Stop turning\u2026.\"Robb said, \"Okay, I'll continue to ask you questions then. If you give the wrong answer, fourth gear.\u201dThe necromancer obediently said, \u201cPlease ask.\u201dRobb said, \"Did you first go to Stone Canyon before coming here?\u201cYes!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What did you do to them?\u201dThe necromancer said with a bitter face, \"I didn't kill them but controlled them and made them loyal.\"Robb's fingers flicked a few times on the stone table, \"sure enough, what you want is to occupy and dominate. That's interesting.\"\"What's so interesting about it?\" Gorda asked curiously, \"Mr. Robb, why are you smiling as if you\u2019re sure what\u2019s going on?\"\"The reason is simple,\" Robb said. \"if these necromancers take over a village and kill all the people, it means they just came to make trouble and leave after doing so. However, they don\u2019t kill people. They only occupy and dominate, which shows that they have a big plan.\u201dGorda doesn't understand very well.But Little Yi and Lillian both understood, and their faces changed slightly, \u201cThat\u2019s right! It\u2019s simple for them to just wreak havoc, but since they want something long-term, they\u2019re trying to retain the residents.\u201dSeveral people with intelligence at the scene instantly understood that what the necromancers were trying to do was to overthrow the Kingdom of Gran. This is by no means a matter that can be handled by a village, town, or several villages and towns, but it is something that can shake the whole kingdom.\"From what we know so far, almost all the small towns on the western border have been attacked.\" Robb continued, \"except for our Westwind town, which has the ability to resist the undead, almost all other villages and towns were vulnerable to a single blow. It is not difficult to imagine that all the villages and towns on the western border have already been controlled.\"After a pause, he then said, \"the army of the undead has also hoarded a large number of troops in Nanli Village, and even high-level monsters such as skeletal dragons have moved out to sit in Nanli Village in order to block reinforcements from Bright Road and isolate all the small towns in the western border. Only in this way can they be given enough time to consolidate their rule in these towns and villages.\"If they were just an army of the undead making trouble, it would have come to an end at this point, but they obviously have a bigger plan, so they would certainly send troops from the south to attack the Bright Road.\"Little Yi's face became extremely ugly, \"Bright Road is very important in the west of the Kingdom of Gran. if it is lost, the confidants of the Kingdom of Gran will be exposed in front of the army of the undead, and the army of the undead may even go straight to the Capital of Saints. What should we do? Can the Bright Road hold them off?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Little Yi. There's no point in worrying about that,\" Robb said with a smile. \"there should be no problem because Bright Road has the White Lion Cavalry, not to mention the templar knights.\"Little Yi looked pale and said, \"the White Lion Cavalry are fine, but the templar knights should have set off to the depths of the Black Pine Mountain Range to purify the skeletons\u2026 They\u2026 They might have been attacked by undead, which would be quite dangerous.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Robb shrugged as if it were true. The last necromancer left behind more than a thousand wandering skeletons. At that time, Little Yi and the Baron said they would ask the Templar Knights to purify them. Did the Templar Knights get led out of the hole like this?Forget it! It has nothing to do with me anyway.Robb said, \"Little Yi, no matter what, a little nun will not be able do anything to the battle. Instead of worrying about the other side, you might as well worry about your own safety.\"\u201cUh\u2026 That\u2026 that is true.\u201d Little Yi sighed and sat down, slumped.In the middle of a war, her personal strength was so limited that she could not do much other than pray for the Bright Road and templar knights.Of course, she did not know that Robb had the ability to fight off these armies of the undead. She knew that it was useless even if she asked him for help. Robb was not in such a good mood to run around the world to fight for others. He doesn\u2019t bother to do stupid things that do no good to him at all.Robb turned to the necromancer again, \"although you led the army to Westwind Town, you must have left some people in Stone Canyon, at least some of the troops, to consolidate control over the people. Tell me, how much of your army is left there?\"The necromancer said feebly, \"not many, only two hundred skeletons.\"Robb said, \"wouldn't skeletons wander aimlessly without the necromancer?\"\"Yes, that\u2019s why there\u2019s an apprentice over there.\" The necromancer said, \"he is my disciple. He has not been practicing dark magic for long, so his magic is not strong yet.\"\u201cOh, great!\u201d Robb smiled and said, \u201cbecause you were honest, you\u2019ll skip the fourth gear.\u201dThe necromancer is overjoyed.But Robb immediately continued, \u201cWe\u2019ll go directly to fifth gear.\u201d\"What?\" The necromancer was surprised, \"But you said\u2026.\"Before he could finish, Robb had already pressed the release button of the magic container with vigor.In an instant, wind magic surged out, the ceiling fan whirled violently, and the necromancer turned like a top. This time Lillian didn't bother to hit him with bamboo.Robb also said in a strange way, \"I advised you to surrender, but you didn't, so the fifth gear was inevitable. But because you confessed just now, I reduced dozens of seconds.\"He had not finished a word when suddenly he heard the sound of a \"bang,\" and the ceiling fan fell apart.It turns out that the wind magic was too strong. This ceiling fan is just a shoddy machine made of rough iron. The technology of this age is still not enough. The cracks between the gear and fans is full of cracks. How can it bear the ultra-high speed rotation? The fan was overwhelmed and completely scattered.While the necromancer flew out with high centrifugal force. He hit the tree with a heavy bang and slid down slowly against the trunk like a picture.The townspeople collectively said, \"Father, your torture instrument is broken.\"It became completely awkward!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It is intended to do so. It throws the villain out and hits him hard. You see, what a terrible bump he got. He literally went black and blue in an instant. Isn't that scary? The final throw, which is the final punishment, is much worse than the previous rotations. I advise everyone to be kind and not do any wrong. If anyone wants to take an evil path, his fate will be this necromancer\u2019s.\u201dThe townspeople clapped their hands, \u201cFather Robb\u2019s instrument of torture is amazing!\u201dOnce the people were guaranteed safety, they immediately wanted to settle down.The White Birch refugees in the chapel, who had given up hope for life, only wanted to shudder in fear in the chapel before but seeing that Robb had easily repelled the army of the undead and captured the enemy necromancer alive. Moreover, the town had not suffered a loss, and their yearning for a better life immediately came back.Most of the townspeople were excellent carpenters, and after Robb lent some axes and saws for them, the carpenters immediately took action and went up the hillside to cut wood!A group of hunters was scattered around the carpenters to prevent them from being attacked by monsters such as goblins.Before long, log after log was lifted, and the townspeople of White Birch Town showed their excellent carpentry skills and built rows of wooden houses on the hillside in a very short time. For the safety of these houses, excellent carpenters also specially built a high wall of wood encircling a large area of the wooden houses.The original wall of Westwind Town is made of stone, but this is equivalent to adding a second area with wooden walls outside the town, making Westwind Town protrude like \u2018\u51f8\u2019.Robb's church was located near the hillside at the edge of the town, a little away from the town center, but the new town was built on the hillside behind the chapel, surrounded by wooden walls. The chapel was inevitably sandwiched between two towns.The environment around the chapel suddenly became lively. It used to take a long time for a townsman to pass by the chapel door, but now someone passes by every now and then, becoming as lively as the town center.Of course, the happiest thing for Robb was that the White Birch refugees did not crowd in the chapel. They all moved out and lived in wooden houses. Every family desperately tried to get back on its feet, wanting to start a new life.A group of White Birch hunters volunteered to join Robb's \"stockings factory\" and entered the first group, the \"spider raising group,\" so they went hunting in the mountains to feed the hundreds of little spiders already growing up.When they received their first salary from the cloth merchant, they suddenly found that the salary was quite high, which seemed to be higher than their income from hunting in White Birch Town. They couldn't help thinking, [Should we still go back to White Birch Town after driving away the undead?]In addition, some carpenters also took action, making all kinds of wooden furniture for the locals of Westwind Town in exchange for some rewards, and then quickly gained enough capital to settle down.They were surprised to find that the townspeople of Westwind Town seemed to be very rich. Why did these people have so much money? They can afford to pay a lot of money for the furniture they make without frowning.Upon careful inquiry, they found that many of the townspeople in Westwind Town had exchanged two buckets of juice from Robb for a bucket of Coca-Cola, and the last time the traveling merchant came to Westwind Town, he not only bought a lot of it from Robb but also bought a lot from the townspeople.This has led to a great harvest for the people of Westwind Town!In addition, after the arrival of the priest, there were all kinds of random tasks for people to do, such as repairing water towers, making iron pipes, changing copper pipes, offering a reward for rubber, a reward for strange and delicious food, and a reward for wild pork. Anyway, You get paid for all kinds of tasks.How much money did Robb get from the merchants? A lot of it went to these townspeople. How can they not be rich?The townspeople of White Birch Town, who have invested a little into their own work, have been paid a lot and feel that they have settled down enough.Many of them began to wonder whether it was necessary to return after the war was over.Robb finally sent out the refugees from the White Birch Town, but there were dozens more refugees from Stone Canyon in the chapel, which was very uncomfortable!He still can't take a bath in the yard and still has to put up with a group of people living like a mess in his own home.At this time, at the stone table in the yard, Robb, Little, the three adventurers, and Lillian were talking about Stone Canyon.Lillian had a pathetic expression on her lovely little face, but she was still sensible and didn't ask anyone to save the people from Stone Canyon.She didn't ask, but Robb couldn't ignore it.He did not like the pitiful expression of his little maid. He hoped that she would laugh and smile as happily as before.\"To put it bluntly, I want to save the townspeople in Stone Canyon.\" Robb said solemnly, \"but I can't leave Westwind town easily. If I leave, it will be attacked by an army of the undead, and it will only take a minute to fall.\"Little Yi and the three adventurers shrugged simultaneously, \"You obviously just don\u2019t want to run so far to Stone Canyon.\u201d\u201cAh!\u201d Robb said, \u201cWhether you see through it or not, we can still be buddies.\u201dEveryone spread their hands and said nothing. Everyone was used to Robb's style of speaking.Robb said, \"I hope the four of you can take a trip to Stone Canyon, where there is only one necromancer apprentice and about two hundred skeletons. With your abilities, there should be no problem killing the apprentice and bringing back the townspeople from Stone Canyon. \"The three adventurers smiled and said, \"No problem. Anyway, Mr. Robb has paid us enough for us to run around the Fengmo Continent. Let's see if the nun is willing to go.\"Little Yi immediately put on a serious face, \u201cOf course, I\u2019ll happily go, no matter when, no matter where, as long as I can save the suffering, I am willing to do my best.\u201dThe three adventurers spread their hands, \"although we know that the Church of Light is not a good organization, a nun like you can still make us review our impressions of it.\"Little Yi said with a straight face, \"Please do not speak ill of the Church of Light in front of a priest and nun. The rumors you have heard are false news deliberately spread by the believers of the God of Darkness to discredit us. The Church of Light has always been a kind and just organization.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They waved to Robb and said, \u201cMr. Robb, we\u2019ll go to Stone Canyon first. You just have to stay here and wait for the good news.\u201dRobb smiled and took out a scroll, which was exactly the same as the \"strategic-grade portal scroll\" taken out by the baron not too long ago, and handed it to Gorda, \"after rescuing the people there, immediately open the portal and withdraw; otherwise, it\u2019ll take a few days, I do not know what kind of trouble you\u2019ll encounter if you do so. Just note that the person who releases the scroll must be the last to enter the door because the portal will disappear as soon as he enters. But before that person enters, the number of people this portal can move is unlimited. \"Gorda smiled and took the scroll, \"That role suits me very well. People like me are always the last to enter and leave.\u201dHowever, Little Yi was stiff, \u201cThis\u2026 This strategic-grade item\u2026 You can just take this out?\u201dRobb spread his hand, \u201cThere are still many things I can do, so don't be surprised.\"Xuelu pulled Little Yi\u2019s arm and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go! Mr. Robb is unfathomable. He\u2019s not as simple as you think, so don't be surprised all the time. \"Afterward, Little Yi and the three adventurers left!Robb turned to Lillian. \"well, you can rest assured now. With the ability of the four of them, they can defeat a necromancer apprentice. It should be easy for them to save your aunt, but\u2026 After your aunt is rescued, she will definitely be beaten by me, so you should also be prepared. \"The expression on Lillian's face was complicated; she had relief like a stone falling to the ground and a little worry about her aunt being beaten by Robb. It was hard to tell whether she was crying or laughing.\u201cAlright!\u201d Robb said, \"Don't think about it anymore. Go and get the dozens of refugees from Stone Canyon. I must also make arrangements for them, lest they stay in my chapel all the time.\"Lillian hastened to call them, and soon dozens of refugees from the Stone Canyon stood at the side of the stone table, respectfully hanging their hands by their abdomen, and obediently listened to Robb's arrangements.Robb knew one of the middle-aged men. He was called Uncle Johnny by Lillian. He looked familiar, so he waved to Johnny and said, \"You\u2026 you\u2019re called Johnny, right?\u201d\"Yes, My Father.\" Like the townspeople of Westwind Town, the townspeople of the Stone Canyon have to respectfully call Robb their father.Robb now has so many sons that he felt a little overwhelmed, \"what do you people do back in Stone Canyon?\" he asked.Johnny said respectfully, \"half of us are miners and masons, and the other half are farmers. The population of Stone Canyon is small, so we only have those.\u201d\u201cOh? So little?\u201d Robb said.Johnny said, \"Stone Canyon is a valley full of stones. There are no tall trees in the valley and no animals to hunt, so we only have two industries: mining stones and growing crops. Fortunately, Stone Canyon is rich in all kinds of gemstones. As long as we dig up a good stone and wait for the merchant Pobo to buy it, it will be enough for us to eat for a year or two. To tell you the truth, I am a miner and gem cutter. I mine up a good stone, carve and polish it, and finally sell it to Pobo, a big merchant. \"He tapped gently on the table with one hand and asked, \"now you can't go back to Stone Canyon. Even if we can defeat the army of the undead in Stone Canyon, you dare not live there because no one knows when the next wave of undead will come. You can only settle down in Westwind Town.\"Johnny nodded sadly, \"Right! We can\u2019t go back. We'll have to settle down in Westwind Town until this war is over. \"\u201cHow will you settle in Westwind Town?\u201d Robb said, \"you can't live on me giving you potatoes all the time, can you? That kind of life is pointless.\"Johnny said, \"We have farmers. We can make a living if we make a field on the hillside.\"When he said this, Robb immediately remembered, \"by the way, you farmers from Stone Canyon seem to know how to grow beets.\"\u201cWe do! A lot of people know how to grow that thing,\" Johnny said.\"That's good. Then, after all the people from Stone Canyon have been rescued, we'll open up a large area of land for agriculture to plant beetroot.\" Robb said.Johnny said, \"Huh? A large area of land, just for beetroots? You won\u2019t eat full.\u201dRobb said with a smile, \"it doesn't matter. I'm sure they'll have enough to eat. Well, now the farmer problem is solved. Let's talk about the miners and masons. In fact, I need all kinds of gemstones. I like using them to make beautiful necklaces and rings. However, now that the Stone Canyon has fallen, it is impossible to get these things normally, so I thought Westwind Town may have more than iron ore and copper mines. Westwind Town is not far from Stone Canyon. It only takes three days to travel between the two. I do not believe the geological difference between the two is great. We may even find a gemstone mine if you look carefully enough.\"Johnny shook his head and sighed, \"We don\u2019t do jobs such as surveying the area and looking for gemstone mines. It was through the shadow of one of our ancestors that we knew that there were gemstone mines in the Stone Canyon.\u201dRobb smiled, \"Well, I can help you.\u201dRobb has a special ability called \"Gemstone Search\", which is the unique skill of the gem cutters in the game \"Dark Blade\".He took out the map of the mountains around Westwind Town and put it on the stone table in front of him, and activated \u201cGemstone Search.\u201d And instantly, there were two yellow dots on the map, which only he could see. Johnny can't see it.Robb reached out and pointed to one of the yellow dots, \"Here! Tomorrow, you will take all the miners who have escaped to this spot and concentrate all efforts on digging this place. I think you will soon find something to live on. \"\"Really?\" Johnny was confused. How can he just casually open a map and say there is a gemstone mine here? Isn't it a little hasty?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If you unfold the map like this and use your finger to say that there is a gemstone mine in an area, isn't it a little, that.\u2026\"Robb, \u201cWow! You want to say that I am talking nonsense and fooling around, but you are embarrassed to say it, so you had to say the word 'that'\u2026.\"Johnny looked embarrassed and didn't know how to answer that.At this time, Lillian stood up and said, \"Uncle Johnny, my master is very good. He is blessed by the gods. If he said that there is a gemstone mine there. I think there must be one.\"The little maid's expression looked firm!However, this is not enough to make a group of old miners believe Robb's \"nonsense\" Johnny had to say with a wry smile, \"Fine, fine. I believe it.\"His brief oppressive moment calmed down.Johnny and the dozens of refugees from Stone Canyon have been living off of potatoes from Robb's chapel, and they have no right to object at all. Robb told him to dig, so he had no choice but to dig. It was not a question of whether he agreed or not but that whether he agreed or not, he had to do it.Even though he was doubted, Robb was not angry and asked Lillian to prepare some tools and give them to Johnny and the miners from the Stone Canyon to dig tomorrow.The miners and masons now have something to do. But the half who are farmers have something to ask.The farmers gathered around Robb and said pitifully, \"Father, we are very grateful to you for arranging for us to live in Westwind Town and grow beetroot for a living. However, it is only late August, and it will take until the beginning of spring next year to grow beets. We need to sow the beets in spring. It blooms from May to June and bears fruit in July. How will we survive till spring? We can\u2019t eat from you all the time. Do you have any other task for us to do to keep us steady?\u201d\u201cOh? That\u2019s a problem. I also don't like dozens of people living in my house from summer to next spring.\u201d Robb put his chin in one hand and said, \"well, before next spring comes, you will plant potatoes for the time being. The end of August is the season for planting potatoes. I'll give you a batch of potatoes to sow. Before the potatoes ripen, work for me. The content of your work is to help me harvest beets and process them. By next spring, you will grow your own beets. \"\u201cWhat?\u201d The farmers were a little confused, \"We understand the part about growing potatoes. But to help you harvest and process beets, I don't understand. Where can the beets be harvested?\"Robb smiled and said, \"Isn\u2019t it easy to get beets? I\u2019ll just start planting now!\"A farmer immediately stood up and said, \"Father, we just told you that it is not appropriate to plant beets in this season. The beet seeds in your hands should have been harvested only last month, and it is not appropriate to sow them until next spring. If we could grow beets now, we wouldn't have to ask you for help.\u201dIn a low voice, Lillian hurried over and explained, \"my master doesn't grow crops in normal ways, but by divine grace.\"The farmer looked confused and said, \"what the heck?\"\"Well, you wouldn't understand even if I told you now.\" Lillian said, \u201cin short, you'll understand soon.\u201dRobb took out the beetroot seeds that the three adventurers brought back last time.These beetroot seeds have been here for several days now, but Robb has been too lazy to sow them. On one hand, the desire to eat sugar finally defeated the lazy cells in his body, so he had to get up and grow beets.The other is that he really doesn't like a group of people staying in his own home. If he doesn't find something for these people to do and let them settle down, he\u2019ll feel depressed.That is to say, what goes around, comes around. it is a false proposition that you can be lazy forever unless you are willing to cut off all troubles in the world, not be moved by external things, not be trapped by any human feelings, and be selfish only for yourself. However, that is tantamount to cutting off all social relations.Humans are creatures that like living in groups. You'll live like a chicken feather if you cut off your social life.Only the protagonists in Xiuzhen's novels can achieve such abstinence, but those protagonists are not living people at all. They are all immortals. Don't the immortals often say, \"Don't interfere with Laozi's immortal cultivation, regardless of what happens?\"Robb doesn't want to live like an immortal.The farmers watched helplessly as Robb came to the edge of the field and planted the beet seeds one by one.These two fields have been used to grow a batch of potatoes and have been harvested for tens of thousands of jin. Robb, a lazy guy, has only collected enough to eat, so he is too lazy to plant another batch, leaving the two fields empty.The farmers saw him plant the seeds in the field badly, then symbolically watered the field with a kettle, placed his buttocks back on the stone stool, collapsed, and complained, \"I'm exhausted.\" farming is really hard. \"The farmers did not know how to complain for a moment, so they had to stare at him awkwardly.\"What are you looking at?\" Robb said, \"Go to the hillside and find a place to build a house. If you can't build a house, go to the carpenters from White Birch Town and ask them for help. As for payment, put it on my head. When you help me harvest the beets tomorrow, I will pay you the wages, so you can pay the people in White Birch Town. In addition, you should reclaim some land for cultivation, plant potatoes, hurry up and work, and don't waste precious time here. Also, at this time tomorrow, remember to come to me and help me harvest beets, and then I will teach you how to make sugar. \"\"What? Harvest\u2026 tomorrow?\u201d\"Making sugar?\"The farmers looked confused, but Robb didn't bother to explain. \"These are your fellow villagers,\" Robb said to Lillian. \"You are responsible for explaining. I\u2019m exhausted. I\u2019m going to take a good rest.\"He reclined on the stone stool and wanted to open the ceiling fan but suddenly found that the ceiling fan had fallen apart, so he had to point the magic container at him and let the magic out. The wind blown by magic is really soulless and makes people feel uncomfortable. It seems that we still have to call the blacksmith back and reassemble the fan.For now, forget it. I can barely make do with the magic container for now.When he closes his eyes, he can hear the cicadas crying in the mountains, and you can hear Lillian whispering to the farmers about the miracle of harvesting crops overnight, and the miners whispering to each other about whether they can really dig up a gemstone mine tomorrow. These noises are not annoying. They have the feelings of life.Life in Westwind Town is actually wonderful. It was worth Robb's efforts to defend it!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The slope is full of green grass and many trees, a group of townspeople from White Birch Town is cutting down trees here, and many stumps can be seen on the ground.If someone says that a gemstone mine is buried here, the townspeople will not believe it even if it kills them.Johnny said to the man next to him, \"do you think there is a gemstone mine here?\"The man shook his head, \"Doesn\u2019t seem like it!\"\"But the priest said there was a mine here.\" Another man said, \"Why don't we dig a bit first? Even if we go back, we have nothing to do. We eat his food and use his equipment. I'll feel guilty if we don't listen to him.\"\u201cHow about we listen to God\u2019s words, dig hard for a few days, and then tell the priest that we didn't manage to dig it up? That should be fine.\"Johnny nodded and said, \"that's the only way it can be done now!\"He drew a big circle on the ground and said, \"everybody concentrates your efforts and dig down from this circle; first remove the vegetation and soil above, and then dig out the stones below to see if there is a gemstone mine. You\u2019ll be able to tell as long as you see the stones.\"\u201cUnderstood! Let\u2019s dig!\u201dMore than a dozen people work together using hoes and shovels.The soil here is thick, which made it hard to dig.More than a dozen people have been digging until noon, not finding any gemstones, not even regular stones. They can't help but feel a little discouraged and thought, [What is the geography of this area? Perhaps the earth below is layered with soil that seeps deep into the center of the earth. There aren\u2019t even ordinary stones, let alone any gemstones.]While a lot of discussion and thoughts went on, Lillian came, carrying two huge baskets full of boiled potatoes, smiled and said to everyone, \"Uncle Johnny, call everyone to lunch!\"Johnny turned around and saw that Lillian, a weak little girl, had a huge basket in each hand, carrying enough potatoes for more than a dozen miners. He couldn\u2019t help but wonder and said, \"Lillian, where did you get such strength?\"Lillian smiled and said, \"The master gave me a bafu. Ah, no, it's a Buff. It's said to be a blessing of the king, so I get a lot of strength.\"Johnny rolled his tongue and didn't quite understand.Lillian gave the potatoes to everyone, then looked at the pit they dug and couldn't help asking, \"haven't you found the gemstone mine yet?\"Johnny shook his head with a black face. \"not to mention a gemstone, we couldn\u2019t even dig up stone. The soil here is so thick that I even suspect there's only dirt here. Even if you keep digging, you'll only get dirt.\"\"That's impossible. Master said there was a gemstone mine here, so there must be one.\" Lillian had great confidence in Robb. She looked around, picked up a pickaxe from a miner who was eating potatoes, and smiled and said, \"Let me help dig.\"Johnny said, \"how can you do such a rough job as a little girl? put down the pickaxe.\"\"It doesn't matter. I told you I have a BUFF from my master.\" Lillian jumped into the big hole dug by the miners, raised her pickaxe with both hands above her head, and concentrated all the strength that the blessing of the king had brought to her.Then, she jumped!She jumped several meters high. The agile movement startled the miners.It turns out that the blessing of the king does not only add strength but also increases agility, intelligence, and magic resistance.Lillian jumped high, then fell heavily, her arms waved down with her greatest strength, and the iron pick hit the bottom of the pit hard with great force.All the people heard was a loud bang, flying soil and stones. The pit was several meters deeper in an instant.Johnny and the miners were so startled that they never dreamed that Lillian, a weak girl, could wield a pickaxe in such a manner.\u201cI\u2019ve dug into stone!\u201d Lillian stood at the bottom of the pit and laughed, \"Look, there's stone below. It's stone.\"\u201cOh? There\u2019s stone?\u201d This raised the miners\u2019 spirits.Johnny was the first to jump into the pit, and after removing a layer of dirt with both hands, he slapped the bottom of it with a look of joy on his face, \u201cHuh? Huh, huh, huh? This\u2026 Sure enough, there\u2019s stone here\u2026 this\u2026 this is an amethyst vein. Oh my God! It\u2019s an amethyst vein!\u201dHearing this, all the other miners froze and then jumped into the pit crazily and desperately scraped open the dirt layer with their hands. Before long, a dozen miners shouted excitedly. Sure enough, there\u2019s an amethyst vein. This is an amethyst vein. Ha, so there is really a gemstone mine here. We can settle down here, hahaha!\u201d\"I told you!\" Lillian proudly put her hands on her hips. \"if my master said there was a mine here, then there must be a mine. My master is a man blessed by the gods. He is so great that there is nothing he can't do.\"The miners and masons no longer dared to have the slightest doubt about Robb and even felt ashamed that they had doubted him.They climbed out of the mine, knelt around the pit, placed one hand on the left side of their chest, pointed to the top of their heads with the other, and swore loudly, \"Stone from above! I swear that I will unconditionally follow Father Robb's guidance and teachings all my life. If I break this oath, please let the stone fall and kill us. \"Miners often need to go to the mine, and for them, the most dangerous thing is the collapse of the mine, so \"Stone from above\" and \"Let the stone fall and kill us\" is their most solemn oath, and no one dares to joke with it.Lillian smiled when she heard them take the oath so seriously, \"Just trust my master, but he won't want you to be killed. He is the kindest and most benevolent man in the world. You\u2019ll see later.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After finding the huge vein, they first have to pierce it with a chisel, separating it bit by bit, before turning it into a small piece of raw gemstone and lifting it up from the mine.Not every piece of stone has an amethyst, however, and not every amethyst can reach the quality that can be sold for good money. They need to carefully judge the gemstone's quality and find the best of them. Afterward, it\u2019ll undergo processing and polishing to become beautiful crystal jewelry.Of course, this is all for later.They don't have enough hands. At present, there are only a dozen people here, and more miners and a lot of miners and masons are still in Stone Canyon. So they have to wait for the three adventurers and Little Yi to get them back.Therefore, the more than a dozen miners present just used their fastest speed to get the raw amethyst. It was getting later, so they didn\u2019t even polish it.When they returned to the church with the stones in their hands, they saw a mountain of beetroots stacked in the open space of the chapel. A dozen farmers were lying beside the beet pile like dogs.When the miners came back, the farmers said feebly, \"how's your work going? We collected a large area of beets and were as tired as dogs. But\u2026 I\u2019m so happy\u2026 Father Robb can really grow beets in a day, ignoring the season, the true miracle of the God of Light.\u201dThe miners couldn't help laughing, \"You're not tired like dogs. You really became tired dogs. Hahaha, you look stupid with your tongue sticking out. The work on our side is going very well. There are really veins in the place that Father Robb pointed out to us. Hahaha, an amethyst mine.\"Johnny held the raw amethyst they had carefully selected in both hands and sent it to Robb, who was lazy on his stone stool, \"Father, this is the best raw amethyst we have dug up today. We intend to give it to you after it is polished and beautiful\u2026.\"\u201cOh?\u201d Robb took the raw gemstone. The so-called raw gemstone, which looks like an ordinary stone with an inconspicuous appearance, still needs a series of processes such as cutting, grinding, polishing, carving, and so on before it can be turned into a beautiful gem for people to enjoy.However, Robb did not have this problem. He pinched it with his hand and used the skills of the jeweler class. And in an instant, the raw gemstone in his hand was cut and polished, turning it into a crystal clear amethyst.The masons beside Robb couldn\u2019t see him use his skill but could only see some of the stone powder slipping slowly between his fingers. The raw gemstone quickly turned into amethyst, which was simply unimaginable and confusing.Robb looked at the stone in his hand and exclaimed, \u201cAmethyst, finally! It can only be counted as an entry-level gemstone, and you can't make any earth-shaking equipment. But it should still make a fine necklace for my lovely Lillian. \"He took out two gold coins, rubbed them, and a \"Magic Reflection Amethyst Necklace\" suddenly appeared in front of everyone. The necklace's chain was pure gold, shining with 24K gold, while the necklace's pendant was the amethyst dug up by the miners. It was huge, crystal clear, and mysterious. It was filled with lustrous purple light. It looked very beautiful.Purple light is the representative color of \"arcane magic\" enchantments; this system of magic enchantments has a variety of functions. For example, the enchanted \"Magic Reflection\" of this necklace, this prefix reflects magic.Robb waved to Lillian and smiled, \"come here.\"Lillian came over obediently.Robb turned her back to him, then gently lifted her long blond hair with his hand, revealing her snow-white neck, which was so charming that one couldn't help but want to kiss it. With very gentle movements, he helped Lillian put on the amethyst necklace and let her stand a few meters away.Lillian, dressed in a maid costume, white stockings, and an amethyst necklace, looked beautiful.Robb sighed, \"Lillian, you are so cute.\"The people next to them all nodded together like robots. No one questioned what Robb had just said, but Lillian herself bowed her head shyly, \"such a valuable necklace is not something a person of my status can wear. Master should keep it and give it to his wife later.\u201d\"I am a single dog who yearns for freedom. I'm afraid it will take more than ten or twenty years to have such a thing, madam.\" Robb spread out and said, \"Don't panic! This necklace is yours from now on. Don\u2019t make any excuses anymore.\u201dLillian blushed and silently accepted the necklace.Just then, Robb suddenly raised his hand, pointed at Lillian, and a fireball flew out of his fingertips. It brushed the ground across the distance between the two and hit Lillian.Lillian was stunned by the sudden arrival and didn\u2019t evade at all. The people nearby were also startled, not knowing what the priest was doing all of a sudden.Johnny exclaimed, \"No!\"But as he exhaled, the necklace around Lillian's neck glowed with purple, which formed a purple mirror in front of Lillian. Robb's fireball hit the mirror and bounced back with a whir, and hit Robb himself in the face.With a bang, the fireball exploded, hitting Robb on the ground.Lillian: \"\u2026\u2026\"Townspeople, \u201cWhat the heck is going on?\u201dThe only person in the world who can hurt Robb is probably himself. This fireball knocked out 1/10 of his own HP.He smeared the black ash on his face and filled his HP with healing magic, saying angrily, \"F**k, my magic hurts.\"Lillian said, \"Master, what were you doing just now?\"The townspeople were also confused and said, \"Father, what were you trying to play?\"Robb spread his hand, \"I'm testing the necklace I just made! Magic reflection is really sick, ahem! All right, Lillian, I'll give you a blessing from now on, and you can tear all the wizards with your hands. You\u2019ll be able to beat all the magicians now.\u201dLillian looked confused and said, \"Muh?\u201dRobb said, \u201cNever mind, you are a peace-loving girl. You will not beat people. You only need the necklace's exteriors. What magic reflection? You don't use it.\"Lillian breathed a sigh of relief. \"Whoa, I thought my master wanted me to fight. I can't fight.\"Robb gave her a thumbs up, \"Continue being like that. That\u2019s better.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As long as you dig something up, you get a harvest immediately, which is really enviable, but those of them who are farmers are different. The planting cycle of crops is too long, and you have to pick the season. They can't settle down like the miners in the twinkling of an eye.Today, although they helped Robb harvest a mountain of beets and did some work, they knew that helping people harvest crops was not a great job. They were lucky that Robb was kind enough to give them some pay. They can't say anything if they aren't happy with it either. After all, they are still eating potatoes given by Robb.On the other hand, they are still reclaiming their land for cultivation. They have not even begun sowing potatoes, and their harvest is far off. This sense of disparity makes them look up a little bit.As soon as Robb looked at these guys, he knew they \"Had nothing to live for\" how could he accept that? [I want to eat candy. You scum don't have to worry about that stuff. Hurry up and get to work.]But even if he thought so in heart, he couldn\u2019t say that.Robb put on a compassionate, gentle, and kind expression and said to the farmers, \"Don't panic. I know you lack confidence in your future, but I guarantee that you will feel that your life has reached its peak tomorrow. I am about to pass on to you a holy skill, and when you learn it, you will be full of confidence next year, the year after that, and for the rest of your life.\"Hearing what he said, the farmers were refreshed and already worshipped Robb. After all, it was no exaggeration to say that such a man who could grow crops in one day was carrying the blessings of God.Everyone hurried closer, stood respectfully, and assumed the appearance of being taught with an open mind.Robb said, \"First of all, go and wash the beetroots. You don't have to finish them all. I'm just going to teach you how to do it. It's just 'trial production. So just wash 20 or 30 beets first, wash them as quickly as you can, and bring them to me.\"The farmers hurried to wash the beets.Robb told Lillian, \"go and get a pot and some linen.\"Lillian took orders and soon brought out a very large pot. Yes, it was the pot she used to cook the stew.She knew Robb hated mixed stew most and didn't like using this pot to cook food. She didn't know why she was asked to take it out. She was confused, but she still obediently brought it out.Robb gave Lillian the blessing of the king and said with a smile, \"go and half-fill the pot with water and heat it on the fire.\"Lillian did as told, and the cauldron was half-filled with water and boiled on the fire.This is just like the mixed stew. Lillian said awkwardly, \u201cMaster, this is\u2026 Do you finally want to eat mixed stew?\u201d\"Only ghosts want to eat that!\" Robb couldn't help covering his nose when she talked about the stew.Seeing that the farmers had brought the washed beets, Robb immediately ordered, \"cut the beets into small pieces and throw them into the pot to cook.\"The farmers thought, [is the priest going to make beetroot soup? Forget it! People like us can't figure out what the priest is thinking. Just do it.]They quickly chopped up the washed beets and then threw them all into the pot.They stewed the beetroot in the large pot, and instantly, the sweet smell wafted from the pot.However, seeing that the beets were cooked and ready to eat, Robb did not let people eat the beet but continued to watch the big pot boil without saying a word.It boiled and continued to boil. It was not until the beets had been boiled and turned to dregs that Robb ordered, \"take out the beet dregs from the pot, wrap it in linen, and squeeze it hard to squeeze out all the water back into the pot.\"The farmers were a little confused. One farmer finally couldn't help asking, \"Father, if you squeeze all the water out of the beet dregs, the beet dregs will become completely inedible and taste very bad.\"\"I didn't ask you to eat dregs.\u201d Robb smiled, \"squeeze out the beet dregs and save it for the pigs.\"Farmers: \"\u2026\u2026\"What a waste of food! The farmer wanted to vomit, but no one dared, so he had to endure his heartache, fished the beet dregs out of the pot, wrapped them in linen, squeezed them hard, and squeezed the water out of the beet dregs back into the pot.At this time, there were no solids left in the pot, only a pot of clear water, sweet water.Robb felt sorry for Lillian and didn't want her to work more, so he said to a female farmer next to him, \"come here, take a long spoon, and keep stirring in the pot.\"Although the female farmer did not understand, she obediently did it, taking a long wooden spoon and stirring the sweet water in the pot.The fire under the pot still continued to blow heat, and the water constantly evaporated. And with the stirring of the wooden spoon, the water in the pot is turned continuously, so it evenly evaporates.Slowly, less and less water was left in the pot, and the proportion of sugar became more and more.Stir, stir, and at the last stir, the water in the pot was so scarce that the female farmer felt that every stir of her wooden spoon became very difficult. It turned out that the pot was no longer sweet water but dark brown syrup.The syrup is very high in concentration and sticky, so it is difficult to stir.Robb smiled and said to the female farmer, \"All right! You can stop now.\"The female farmer obediently stopped, and Robb blew out the fire with magic, then picked up a copper spoon, reached into the pot, and scooped up a spoon full of syrup from the bottom of the pot.The syrup began solidifying and turning into a dark brown candy bar like amber as soon as the fire was blown out.Robb wrapped the candy in a cloth, clapped his hands hard, and with a bang, the candy was broken into many small pieces. And he spread out the cloth, and what appeared in front of everyone was a pile of small dark brown crystalline candies.He picked up a small candy and threw it into his mouth.Aaah! This is the taste... The taste of my favorite \u201cSugar Painting\u201d when I was a child.It was not easy to eat the same food only available in his previous world, and Robb was instantly hit with a wave of nostalgia.At this time, the onlookers did not know what Robb had done and looked confused as he showed sadness and was eerily quiet.After a while, Robb picked up a small piece of candy and put it in Lillian's mouth, \"Come, taste it!\"\u3010Robb Acquired Sugar and Candy\u3011Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
