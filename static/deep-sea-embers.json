    "Chapter 1": "Chapter 1 \u201cA Thick Fog That Day\u201dThis Translation is hosted on https://bcatranslation.com/The boundless fog rolled thickly outside the window to the point where the outside world seemed to disappear from the other side, leaving only the chaotic, unclear light that somehow managed to penetrate into this house. It\u2019s through this dimness that light got maintained in this eerie silence.In the slightly messy single apartment, Zhou Ming was lying at his desk with a long pile of debris sprawled across the surface. His condition could only be described as haggard while he wrote in his diary book:\u201cNothing\u2019s changed on the seventh day, and a thick fog had enveloped the outside. I do not know how, but an unknown force locked the window and deprived me of prying it open. The whole room seemed to have been \u2018cast\u2019 into an isolated space by something\u2026.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t contact the outside world either. The electricity got cut off since the beginning, along with the water tap that didn\u2019t flow. Strangely, the lights worked, and the computer kept running \u2013 I ripped the cord out of the wall to see\u2026.\u201dAs if a slight breeze suddenly blew in from the window, Zhou Ming jerked up from his act of burying into the diary and looked up with those haggard eyes. Unfortunately, the noise was nothing more than his own illusion. There was no change, only the never-ending movement of the lingering fog outside the window and the eerie silence of his isolated dwelling in the apartment.Then his sight fell upon the windowsill where he had left the wrenches and hammers \u2013 there are still traces of his attempts in the last seven days to pry open the glass. But now, these tools are nothing more than mocking evidence of failure.After a few seconds, Zhou Ming\u2019s expression became calm again\u2014with this unusual calmness, he lowered his head again and returned to his writing:\u201cI am trapped with no clue how to escape. I even thought of tearing apart the roof and walls in the past few days. But after expending all my strength and ideas, I couldn\u2019t make so much as a dent in these walls. It\u2019s as if the walls were a box, and I\u2019m the mouse trapped inside this box with no way out\u2026.\u201d\u201cThe exception being that door.\u201d\u201cBut the situation outside that door\u2026 it\u2019s even more wrong.\u201dZhou Ming stopped again, slowly examining the handwriting he had left behind on the page before flipping back to the content he had written days ago. These were heavy and suppressed words, meaningless thoughts, irritable graffiti, and awkward jokes written when he forcibly relaxed his mind to avoid going insane.He didn\u2019t know the point of writing down these thoughts. In fact, he\u2019s never been a habitual diary keeper \u2013 as a middle school teacher, he\u2019s limited in leisure time, so he would rather spend his energy elsewhere when possible.But now, whether he liked it or not, he had a lot of leisure time after finding himself trapped inside the apartment room.It was like an absurd nightmare. Everything in the dream was operating against the laws of nature. Still, one thing\u2019s certain after Zhou Ming exhausted all his means: these were no hallucinations nor dreams, but a world that\u2019s no longer normal with him being the only normal thing here.After taking a deep breath, his eyes finally landed on the only door at the end of the room.Made of a ordinary cheap softwood coated with a thin layer of white pain, the door handles were polished from years of use and slightly crooked from age. This was the only thing that could be opened, the only way out of here.If this enclosed alienated room was like a cage, then the most vicious thing about this cage was that it retained a door that could be pushed open at any time, luring the prisoner towards a particular predetermined path. But this \u201coutside\u201d wasn\u2019t somewhere Zhou Ming wanted to be.There are no old but intimate corridors, no sunny streets and vibrant crowds, and nothing familiar to oneself. Instead, there\u2019s only a strange and disturbing exotic land mixed in with an inescapable dilemma awaiting him \u201cover there.\u201dBut Zhou Ming knew that time was running out for himself, and the so-called \u201cchoice\u201d never existed from the very beginning.Simply said, he\u2019s running out of food rations with the last of the bottled water mostly drained. If he doesn\u2019t head over to the other side of that \u201cdoor,\u201d then even the last glimmer of hope would be gone.Perhaps it\u2019s not so bad. The answer to this supernatural phenomenon might be over there as well if he looked hard enough.Zhou Ming took a light breath before lowering his head again to write the last few paragraphs in the diary:\u201c\u2026 But regardless, the only option now is to go across the door. At least there is some food to eat on that weird ship, and my exploration and preparations in the last few days are enough to let me survive on that ship\u2026. Though limited, it\u2019s still better than nothing.\u201d\u201cFinally, to the latecomers, if I don\u2019t come back, and someone like a rescue worker in the future really opens this room and sees this diary, please don\u2019t take all that I have written here as an absurd story\u2014it really happened. Although it sounds all too spooky and surreal, there really was a man named Zhou Ming that got trapped inside this crazy and isolated space in time.\u201d\u201cI did my best in this diary to describe the anomalies I saw, and I recorded all the efforts I made to get out of here. If there are any \u2018latecomers\u2019, please at least remember my name, at least remember all this that has happened.\u201dZhou Ming closed the diary, threw away the pen into the holder, and slowly stood up from the messy desk.It\u2019s time to leave, before he falls into utter desperation and passivity.But after a short thought, instead of going straight to the only door that led to the \u201coutside world,\u201d he went straight to his bed.Confronting that strange world behind the door required the best of him \u2013 and the current mental state he was in was in no way good enough.Zhou Ming didn\u2019t know if he could fall asleep, but even if he forced himself to lie in bed and emptied his brain, it was better than going to the \u201copposite side\u201d in a state of mental exhaustion.Eight hours later, Zhou Ming opened his eyes again.Outside the window, there was still that chaotic fog, and the day and night skylight carried a spooky air of oppressiveness.Zhou Ming directly ignored the situation outside the window. Taking out the last of his remaining rations, he ate everything within eight minutes and then came before a dressing mirror in the corner of the room.The man in the mirror still had messy hair, a haggard face, and no temperament to speak of. Nevertheless, Zhou Ming didn\u2019t look away because he wanted to imprint this image into his own head.After a long and eternal few minutes, he murmurs to the self-reflection: \u201cYour name is Zhou Ming, at least on this \u2018side,\u2019 your name is Zhou Ming. Always keep this in mind and never forget this.\u201dAfter that, he turned and left.Coming to the door that was all too familiar, Zhou Ming took in a deep breath and placed his hand on the door handle.He didn\u2019t carry anything extra on him, neither food nor self-defense gear aside from the experience he gained from the previous \u201cexplorations\u201d \u2014 the reason being he couldn\u2019t bring anything even if he wanted to. The door wouldn\u2019t allow it.With a twist and audible click, he pushed open the door and revealed the black squirming mist behind the wooden barrier. It\u2019s a curtain of blackish-gray, contracting and retracting like a living creature. Regardless of how he thought of the fog, battering waves could already be heard in his ears, followed closely by the salty scent of the ocean as he walked past the safety threshold of his room.Whatever brief momentary dizziness he had dissipated under the shaking from his feet. He\u2019s currently standing on an expansive wooden deck devoid of company and a towering sailing mast looming under those dark stormy clouds. It\u2019s the open ocean, but the water was dark and undulating with no end in sight.Looking down to examine his new body on this \u201cside,\u201d Zhou Ming found it to be buffer than what he last recalled. Though bony like a skeleton, it\u2019s a suitable match for the exquisite captain\u2019s uniform that he had on, as well as the black flintlock pistol of classical design hanging from his waist. But what he wore didn\u2019t matter, the main concern was himself. Was this really the \u201chim\u201d that he knew?Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2 \u201cThe Captain of the Vanished\u201dThis Translation is hosted on https://bcatranslation.com/This is not the first time Zhou Ming had passed through this door to the \u201copposite side.\u201dSince a few days ago, after he found himself trapped in his room by some freaky \u201cphenomenon, he\u2019s been coming through to seek help since it\u2019s the only exit presented before him.He still remembered the first time the door opened. It was the same wooden planked deck, the exact change to his body, and the courage he mustered to explore this \u201cside\u201d several times for help. But try as he might, no answer came, nor does he understand the strangeness of this ghost ship connected to the \u201cdoor.\u201d Nevertheless, he\u2019s at least gained some experience to get a preliminary understanding of this vessel.Like the previous times, Zhou Ming used the shortest time possible to rid himself of the dizzying grog of crossing over. Then he checked the condition of this body for the first time and the gun hanging from his waist. Everything\u2019s like he left it from the last visit.\u201cIt seems my body will \u2018seamlessly switch\u2019 every time I pass through the door\u2026 If only I could place a camera on this side to see what happens. That way I can confirm whether this body will change too when I go back. Shame, the objects of the two \u2018worlds\u2019 aren\u2019t interchangeable\u2026\u201d\u201cOh well, at least I know I did walk into the fog and not just drop unconscious from my apartment according to the recording on that side.\u201dZhou Ming muttered to straighten his theories. He knew talking to himself on the open deck would appear weird to an outsider, but who\u2019s to mock him anyways? There\u2019s not a soul in sight on this ghost ship, and this was his way of proving he\u2019s still \u201calive.\u201dAs the salty breeze blew across the deck and hit his blue and black uniform of unknown material, Zhou Ming sighed softly and turned around to face the door again.Placing his hand on the doorknob to turn it again, he pushed it inward to reveal the grayish black fog from which he came. Beyond this was the familiar apartment that he\u2019s lived in for so long.But he didn\u2019t go through it this time; instead, he closed the door and pulled it back to reveal the captain\u2019s quarter. Inside was a dimly lit cabin with exquisite tapestries hanging from the walls, a shelf with multiple ornaments, and a large mapping table at the center footed by a burgundy carpet.That\u2019s how the \u201cdoor\u201d worked. By pushing it open, it would lead you back to the apartment while pulling leads into the captain\u2019s room \u2013 the latter being the supposed norm.After entering the captain\u2019s quarter, he habitually looked to the left, where a person\u2019s high mirror was fixed to the wall next to him. There, reflected clearly, was the current appearance of \u201cZhou Ming.\u201dIt was a tall man with thick black hair, a short and majestic beard, deep eye sockets, and a look that demanded respect. Despite already over forty, his manly appearance blurred his actual age so one might mistake him for someone younger.Loosening the scruff around his neck, he went ahead and made a silly face in the mirror. Sadly, his temperament with this new self wasn\u2019t working. Rather than being friendly looking, he\u2019s more like a psychopathic serial killer.Wile Zhou Ming was performing these silly gestures, a slight clicking sound came from the direction of the mapping table. Without surprise, he saw the familiar goat-headed wooden statue on the table turning to face him little by little\u2014the inanimate wooden block seemed to come alive at this moment, and the obsidian eyes embedded in the wooden face glimmered with light.The panicked memories of the first time he saw this strange scene flashed through his mind again, but Zhou Ming only cocked the corner of his mouth into a grin. He knows what\u2019s coming, and sure enough, a gloomy and hoarse voice came from the wooden mouth: \u201cName?\u201d\u201cDuncan,\u201d Zhou Ming said calmly, \u201cDuncan Abnomar.\u201dThe voice of the wooden goat\u2019s head instantly changed from hoarse and gloomy to warm and friendly: \u201cGood morning, Captain. It is good to see that you still remember your name. How are you feeling today, and how are you doing today? Did you sleep well last night? I hope you had a good dream. Today is a good day to set sail. The sea is calm, the wind is right, the temperature cool and comfortable, and there are no annoying navel fleets around. Captain, you know a noisy crew\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re noisy enough.\u201d Although it was not the first time he had dealt with this strange goat head, Zhou Ming still felt a shiver run through his spine at the moment. Finally, shooting a glare at the thing, he speaks through gritted teeth, \u201cQuiet.\u201d\u201cOh, oh, of course, Captain. You like the quietness, and as your loyal first and second mate and lead sailor and normal sailor and scout, I know this very well. There are many benefits to being quiet, and there was once a medical field\u2026 or philosophy field or architecture field\u2026\u201dZhou Ming suddenly felt a migraine coming up on his temple as it throbbed from this incessant yapping: \u201cMy meaning is, I\u2019m ordering you to be quiet!\u201dThe goat\u2019s head finally quieted down as soon as the word \u201corder\u201d came out.Breathing a sigh of relief, he stepped up to the mapping table and sat down on the chair \u2013 he\u2019s now the \u201ccaptain\u201d of this empty ghost ship.Duncan Abnomar was an unfamiliar name and an even more foul-mouthed surname. So why does he know this detail? No idea. That\u2019s something this body knew the first time he crossed over. \u201cOver here,\u201d Duncan was on a long journey with most of the details a missing blank.He did get the distinct feeling that he was on some grand sailing plan but knew next to nothing about the so-called plan or where it was headed. As for the actual ship owner, the real \u201cDuncan Abnomar\u201d seemed to have died a very long, long time ago.So what exactly was happening with him? Think of a person being imprinted with an \u201cimpression.\u201dInstinct told Zhou Ming there\u2019s a big problem behind the identity of Captain Duncan, especially in the presence of the supernatural phenomena (the talking wooden goat head) on this ship. However, he didn\u2019t have much choice in the matter. Not only does the goat head would try to confirm his identity whenever he crosses over, but the ship itself would also occasionally do the same. This measure could only be described as insidious by the real owner\u2026It didn\u2019t help either when the goat head on the mapping table looked like some sort of evil gargoyle from the old stories.But with the cons aside, the ship was quite amiable if he endured the Duncan Abnomar name. It\u2019s not like any of the stuff here looked very intelligent anyways.Zhou Ming \u2013 perhaps Duncan now \u2013 ended his brief contemplation in memory lane and unfolded the chart on the mapping table.There were no identifiable routes, markers, or land on the chart \u2013 not even an island. On its rough and thick parchment surface, there were instead large patches of gray-white blobs that were constantly churning and undulating to obscure the original routes mapped on the map. However, there\u2019s one image on it that didn\u2019t get muddled up \u2013 the silhouette of a ship looming in the thick fogDuncan (Zhou Ming) has not much experience in setting sail using the old techniques, but even the dumbasses of modern society would know a \u201cnormal\u201d chart couldn\u2019t look like this.Apparently, like the wooden goat head on the table, the chart was some kind of supernatural object\u2014it was just that Duncan hadn\u2019t yet summed up its use.Seemingly noticing the captain\u2019s attention had finally focused on the chart, the goat\u2019s head, which had been quiet for a long time on the table, moved again. It started to make clicking sounds like wood rubbing against wood. At first it was still restrained, but that promptly reached the point of being unignorable of vibrating like a sex toy.\u201cFine, say it.\u201d Duncan was afraid this seizuring darn thing would put the table on fire at this rate.\u201cYes, Captain \u2014 I repeat, today is a good day to set sail, and the Vanished is waiting for your orders as always! Are we going to raise the sails?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Then quickly repeated the name again in a louder voice than before: \u201cAi!\u201dDuncan finally understood what the bird meant: \u201cYou mean your name is Ai?\u201dThe dove nodded proudly and paced around the desk: \u201cGoogoo!\u201dDuncan couldn\u2019t help but rub his forehead over how strange it was communicating with this dove. It\u2019s even more awkward than speaking with the goat head in his opinion. \u201cDo you know how you were born? Or rather\u2026 how did you end up here?\u201dThe dove thought for a moment before both of them looked in different directions: \u201cAiya, the page you\u2019re looking for is missing, try refreshing it?\u201dDuncan: \u201c\u2026\u201dIt\u2019s nearly impossible to comprehend what was happening in the bird\u2019s head. But one thing\u2019s certain, the bird was sentient in its own way and communicated seriously. The problem was, did they both have the same understanding of what \u201ccommunication\u201d actually meant?Duncan continued his effort to talk with this dove called \u201cAi\u201d. Throughout their conversation, the bird gave a relevant answer to his questions on occasion. However, most replies were incoherent messes that didn\u2019t relate.In the end, little progress was made, leaving the captain frowning: \u201cWhat kind of messed up thing is this\u2026.\u201dUnfazed by the displeasure from the human, the dove crouched down on the table and started roosting while occasionally nagging for V50.Duncan didn\u2019t care about the bird\u2019s chanting, instead curled his fingers and rubbed them gently. As he watched the glowing green flame on his fingertip, the guy was sure of one thing \u2013 the compass and dove were essentially an \u201canomaly item\u201d that he could control.Putting it to the test, he raised the size of the flame\u2019s intensity. Sure enough, the flame around Ai blew up with the pointer inside the compass beginning to slow down like it wanted to point in some direction.Ai didn\u2019t react the whole time though despite being engulfed in fire, merely just bathing itself in the ghost fire and awaiting orders.Then before the brass compass could be fully activated, Duncan took the initiative to disperse the flames.Silently summing up his findings:\u201cFirst, the compass can still be used\u2026 It\u2019s just that there is an extra weird \u2018medium\u2019 now. For the time being, it is not certain what effect this dove will bring, nor should I go on another soul journey until I\u2019m fully prepared.\u201d\u201cSecondly, there is definitely a connection between the dove and me, and this connection will become more pronounced in the case of the fire. To some extent, I can also control the dove\u2026 perhaps even go further than just control\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2018Ai\u2019 clearly has its own will and will act according to its own thoughts. Therefore, my orders are not absolute for her, which is different from the other items on the Vanished.\u201d\u201cCan speak, has a certain ability to think, can judge problems independently\u2026 Compared with the ordinary anomalies, this dove\u2019s nature seems closer to that of the goat head\u2026\u201dDuncan summed up some of the information now known to him and finally shifted his attention to that cursed obsidian black dagger.After a little thought, Duncan reached out and picked up the item, which the priest in that underground sewer used. The cold, hard touch at contact told him it was real.After confirming its not another illusion, Duncan unleashed a little more of his ghost fire, causing the flames to wrap around the blade\u2019s body. Judging from the empty feedback, the extraordinary power contained within this ritual blade had indeed dissipated.As he had previously judged at the sacrificial sight, this thing was not really an \u201canomaly\u201d item but an extension of some extraordinary power or a temporary vessel \u201cinfused\u201d with energy artificially.Although Duncan did not know what kind of system the \u201canomalies\u201d used, he could take a close guess that this blade shouldn\u2019t be a rare item\u2026 more like some mass-produced product.\u201cThis is what you brought back?\u201d He lifted his head and faced Ai, \u201cAnd it\u2019s for me?\u201dThe dove stared straight into Duncan\u2019s eyes with those reddish bean irises without replying.Duncan: \u201c\u2026?\u201dHe asked again, and the dove still didn\u2019t move, as if it had suddenly become a lifeless sculpture.The sudden abnormal change made Duncan frown slightly, but just as he was about to stimulate Ai with the ghost flame to see if he could forcibly wake it up, the bird suddenly \u201ccame alive\u201d. Jumping twice in place and shouting, \u201cTake this solar tomahawk, take this solar tomahawk, take this\u2026\u201d\u201cOkay, I get it. You don\u2019t have to answer every question I ask,\u201d Duncan quickly waved his hand to force the dove to quiet down. Organizing his language first, \u201cThen do you know how you brought this dagger here? Or rather, you can carry \u2018physical objects\u2019 through the space tunnel, right?\u201dThe dove pondered for a moment before pecking Duncan\u2019s finger: \u201cThe whole place is full, and the chicken pieces are free of charge.\u201dDuncan: \u201cI\u2026 I\u2019ll pretend to understand.\u201dHe sighed, thinking he had reached the limit of communication with this bird.Then he got up from his desk and turned to face the door leading to the mapping room. He could still hear the exchanging conversation of the goat head and Alice outside, which was going on rather well with the former going over the seventeenth recipe for kelp stew.At this moment, Duncan felt compelled to save his only (and most normal) crew member.On the other hand, he had been in the bed chamber for far too long. It\u2019s time he showed his face to reassure the goat head.But before leaving, he hesitantly glanced at Ai, who was running around the table again.Do I want to take this dove out too? How do I explain it to them when I do?Duncan hesitated for only two seconds before decisively grabbing the dove and placing it on his shoulder.If he\u2019s going to be active on the Vanished for the foreseeable future, he would need to be more open about certain secrets. Also, hiding a speaking, walking bird on the ship would never end well. What would the other crew members think of his image if they suddenly came across Ai one day?So, he might as well graciously take the dove out and say it was his new \u201cbooty\u201d\u2014he didn\u2019t need to explain anything to the goat head in the first place. After all, the first mate of this ship would fill in the details on his own regardless.As for the strange stories that this dove pops up from time to time (the locals in this world would find it incomprehensible anyway) that doesn\u2019t need to be explained either.Let the goat head and Alice find a way to make up for it.With the fat dove on his shoulder, Duncan freely straightened his posture and calmly walked out of the bed chamber.\u201cAuthentic good herbal tea, authentic good voice, welcome to watch\u2026\u201d The dove proudly straightened its chest as well and shouted as if announcing its entry.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It\u2019s unsettling and painful because there\u2019s always a silent murmuring from the ship to do the same. It\u2019s one reason he always returned to the apartment and didn\u2019t stay longer.Duncan didn\u2019t utter a word for a while as he darkly contemplated the issues at hand. There are two problems he has to resolve if he wants to set sail:First, he was the only one on the darn ship and manning this giant behemoth himself was out of the question. As a wind sailed ship, Duncan roughly estimated the Vanished at a hundred fifty to two hundred meters in length, meaning it takes no less than a few dozen experienced sailors to man or a hundred inexperienced ones to figure out.Second, stripping out the professional factors mentioned above, another critical problem stood in the way of his voyage \u2013 he didn\u2019t know how to drive a ship anyways, regardless of how giddy the manchild in him was behaving at the prospect.Duncan could perhaps ask the goat for advice on using the steering wheel, but the prospect of the endless yapping coming out of that mouth gave him anxiety attacks.Then again, he didn\u2019t need to ask. Perhaps by fate or some supernatural will, the goat head took the initiative to speak: \u201cCaptain, do you have any concerns? If you are worried about the Vanished, rest assured that the ship is always ready to sail with you to the ends of the world. Or are you worried the voyage will be inauspicious? I know a little about divination, but what type do you believe in? Celestial signs, incense reading, and crystals are all OK too. Speaking of crystals, you remember\u2026\u201dDuncan struggled to hold his inner urge to strangle the head right there and then. With suppressed annoyance, \u201cI\u2019ll assess the situation first up on the deck. You be quiet and stay here.\u201d\u201cAs you wish, Captain. But I must remind you that the Vanished has been drifting blindly for far too long. You must take charge of it as soon as possible to get the voyage back on track\u2026\u201d The goat head said before returning to its normal posture following a wood rubbing sound.Peace instantly returned to Duncan\u2019s world in that second. Breathing a sigh of relief, the throbbing resonance in his brain gradually subsided as he picked up the flintlock handgun from the table and walked out of the captain\u2019s room.The rather old-looking flintlock gun he found while exploring the ship was accompanied by a one-handed sword currently hanging from his waist. They gave him confidence in moving about on the vessel. Although there weren\u2019t anyone alive here in the last few days he explored.Talking \u201citems\u201d excluded of course.The salty sea breeze hitting Duncan\u2019s face somewhat calmed his irritable mood as he subconsciously looked up to the sky \u2013 thick clouds as far as the eye could see, no sun, no moon or stars, only a looming black cloud that never dissipates on this endless ocean. For a while, he wondered if there\u2019s ever been such a thing as a normal weather in this world at all\u2026.Then swinging around to face the captain\u2019s quarter again, Duncan saw a line inscribed on the beam above the door. He didn\u2019t recognize the letters, but once his gaze fixed on that line, he directly understood its meaning:\u201cThe door of the lost.\u201d\u201cThe door of the lost\u2026 The Vanished,\u201d Duncan muttered to himself, \u201cthis ship has a suitable name.\u201dHe then strode around and up the stairs at the edge, leading to the stern\u2019s upper deck. This part of the wooden platform had the broadest view and the black steering wheel for the helmsman.This caused a frown to form on Duncan\u2019s face. For some reason, he\u2019s got this senseless urgency to do something at the sight of the black steering wheel. This didn\u2019t happen before, only this time!As if in response to the anxiety in his heart, an unexplained, chaotic wind blew across the deck, and the initially calm sea around him was instantly flooded with waves. Although this wind and wave did not impact the huge \u201cVanished,\u201d Duncan was nevertheless on alert. The next second, he was staring forward at the ship\u2019s bow in surprise.There, between the chaotic and hazy ocean, an endless wall of white suddenly materialized out of thin air and caused him to pop his eyes in shock! This whiteness surrounded and isolated this world. Like a cliff connecting heaven and earth, this strange phenomenon reminded him of the same murky fog from his apartment.Worst of all, the Vanished was driving itself towards the fog!Duncan didn\u2019t know what this whiteness did or what was in the depths of it, but he instinctively sensed danger with the firm notion he didn\u2019t want to go there!Subconsciously rushing over to spot where the wheel was, he wanted to do something, anything! Unfortunately, a sense of great helplessness gripped his figure once he got to the helm \u2013 he still didn\u2019t know how to drive this ship\u2026.Then when he least expected it, a familiar voice came from the copper pipe next to the wheel. It\u2019s connected to the captain\u2019s quarter down below, where the goat head sat, and its tone was unusually unnerved and frantic.\u201cCaptain, there is a border-collapse up ahead, and we are approaching the limits of reality! Please adjust the course now!\u201dListening to the frantic voice of the goat head, Duncan almost broke out yelling. He wouldn\u2019t be standing here acting all helpless if it was so easy to adjust course. There\u2019s no one else to help him for god\u2019s sake!Then he realized something, which only made him even sadder. Forget about adjusting course; the truth was, those masts in front of him were nothing but poles without a single sail!For the first time in days, he had voluntarily placed his hand on the steering wheel in acceptance. Under these strange and dire circumstances, he had no energy left to resist the urging that constantly haunted his sanity.But then in his blank state of hollowness, a great something incredible happened on this ghost ship\u2026.The sound of a mountainous roaring exploded inside Duncan\u2019s mind. As if tens of thousands of cheering men were standing on the shore to send him off for the maiden voyage, he got a strange notion that he was no longer alone but surrounded by working sailors on board shouting out commands in the captain\u2019s name. Even weirder, he could hear the iconic merry pirate song in his ear!Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate\u2019s life for meWe pillage, we plunder, we rifle, and lootDrink up, me \u2018earties, yo hoWe kidnap and ravage and don\u2019t give a hootDrink up me \u2018earties, yo ho\u2026..While his mind tried to wrap around the strange phenomenon, something weirder occurred \u2013 a green flame caught his attention from the edge of his vision. Looking down, it was coming from his palm that\u2019s holding the steering wheel of the Vanished. Then before he knew it, the small blob of ghostly fire had spread across his whole body!Under this satanic ritual, his flesh and blood transformed, turning hollow and illusory, and his uniform became worn and ragged like it\u2019s soaked in the sea for hundreds of years. He\u2019s not even human anymore, but a ghost captain with coursing flames as blood and flesh with a skeletal figure of unquenchable death.Yet, despite the change, he did not feel the slightest pain from his loss. Rather, his perception widened as the ghost fire continued to sweep across the ship. First the helm, then over deck, then across the mast to form intertwined netted sails to give life to this vessel.The Vanished, has finally started sailing again, continuing on its long voyage with an unknown destination.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

So, his hand turned into a death grip around the wheel and refused to let go.He\u2019s not stupid. Duncan had figured out by now the green flame was some kind of harmless \u201cforce.\u201d Whether or not he could recover his body later was a question for later. But at least for now, the flame was helping him, and he needed it badly!Soon, the tsunami of cheers faded, and Duncan found his mind in a state of absolute clarity, with the ship becoming an extension of himself. Although he still didn\u2019t have the knowledge and experience of a qualified captain, controlling the Vanished to move as he please was no longer an issue.First, he tried turning the wheel and got real feedback from the \u201cforce\u201d inside his head \u2013 it was telling him the hull had begun turning as he intended.However, the speed at which the Vanished was turning didn\u2019t seem to be enough, and that got reaffirmed by the screeching cry of the goat head through the copper pipe next to himself: \u201cAttention, we are fast approaching the limit of reality\u2026 we\u2019re about to fall into the spiritual world! Captain, we need\u2026.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m doing it!\u201d Duncan yelled and cut off the goat head\u2019s cry, \u201cInstead of making noise down below, how about you think of something to help!\u201dThe goat head went momentarily quiet, but just when Duncan thought the other party had finally stopped, the copper pipe suddenly came back with a hoarse and somewhat creepy cheer: \u201cFIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT!\u201dDuncan: \u201c\u2026..?\u201dTalk about having reality crash down on his head. Duncan could accept coming to a ghost ship, becoming a ghost captain, and being stewed by a ghostly green fire, but what\u2019s this, cheerleading? The goat head had always given him a dangerous and spooky feeling like that of an evil gargoyle, but now that creepy and scary figurine just became a lala, pompom cheerleader? WTF!But the fast-approaching fog didn\u2019t give Duncan time or chance to think about it. Although the Vanished had begun to turn rapidly, it was still no match for the gaining fog on their rear, and soon, the fog had enveloped the area surrounding the ship.Something strange was definitely taking place in the surrounding environment at that moment. The sky had become particularly dim, and the original blue sea water had now been riddled with wisps of black lines entangling itself like a hairnet. Before long, the blue water had turned into a sea of black water as countless shadowy things emerged.\u201cWe have fallen into the spirit world!\u201d The loud and eerie \u201ccheering\u201d from the goat stopped then; instead, it had become mixed up with a spooky cohort of other voices in the background. \u201cBut the Vanished isn\u2019t completely lost. Captain, take the helm before we sink further into the deep sea. If we maintain course, then the Vanished can still get out!\u201d\u201cThe premise is that I know where to go!\u201d Duncan growled menacingly due to the crackling green flames mixed into his voice, \u201cI\u2019ve lost my sense of direction!\u201d\u201cIntuition, Captain, intuition!\u201d The voice of the goat head shouted through the copper pipe again, \u201cYour intuition is more accurate than the markings on the chart!\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d A feeling of powerlessness surged into his heart.Duncan had no extra strength left to argue with an evil goat head. Since the figurine said he had to rely on intuition, then he might as well get reckless.Following the last tinge of intuition, before the fog blinded his view, he grabbed the steering wheel with both hands and turned it as hard as he could in the direction he believed.From top to bottom, the Vanished issued out a long series of stressing sounds from the hull as the vessel drove in an arc across the black sea. Then suddenly, as the wind howled and the fog swirled around him, Duncan\u2019s eyes caught the emerging glimpse of something.It was a ship, a white vessel that looked smaller than the vanished with a dark chimney in the middle of the hull. As it so happens, the two vessels were on a perfect collision course with one another!Duncan\u2019s inner curse words: \u201cMother fucking chicken dinner! I\u2019m going to sink inside the spirit world!\u201dHe had explored this strange world for so long without seeing a living soul, yet he does so that he could die by crashing at sea? What are the odds?\u2026\u2026As the wind howled and the waves raged, the Boundless Sea unleashed its terrifying might upon this world. In the face of this natural and mighty force, all would feel minuscule before it. For the unfortunate enough like the White Oak to be the bearer of bad news, the ship was currently being squeezed of its last ounce of power from those steam turbines to fight against what would ultimately be death if they failed.The gray-haired captain, Lawrence Creed, stood in the wheelhouse of the White Oak. Despite the sturdy walls and glass windows around him, these superficial barriers did not give him any sense of security. Instead, he could hear the whining stress of mechanical gears battering against one another, which worried him as he gripped the wheel. Even worse, the ever-encroaching fog on top of the enormous waves frightened him.The White Oak was the most advanced steamship in the current world, but even the most advanced machinery could only ensure the ship survived the \u201cnormal\u201d sea. Beyond the murky fog, ahead was what they called the border of reality, the unknown in which evil gods lurked.\u201cCaptain! The pastor can\u2019t hold on anymore!\u201d The first mate\u2019s mournful shouts came from the side.Lawrence could hear the slightly muffled echo from the other\u2019s voice, indicating something was awfully going wrong. Then looking forward to where the prayer table had been set up, an ominous purple-black flame had burst forward from the incense, and the honorable cleric they brought along for the journey was frothing in the mouth. The guy was not well, and the nose bleeds and shivering only meant he was fighting whatever foul taint was invading his soul.\u201cCaptain!\u201d The first mate\u2019s voice came from the side again but got cut off by Lawrence\u2019s following order.\u201cTemporarily close the Holy Emblem Marker. We\u2019ll dive into the spirit world!\u201dThe first mate was momentarily stunned, and the man who had spent half his life at sea seemed unable to believe his ears: \u201cCaptain?!\u201d\u201cSink into the spirit world. We can spend ten minutes there and escape the fiercest wave of the border-collapse. This will give our priest a chance to recover.\u201d Lawrence ordered again with a commanding voice, \u201cObey my orders, NOW!\u201dThe first mate\u2019s jaw moved but then gritted his teeth and complied: \u201cYes, Captain!\u201dThe crew began to carry out the orders in quick and precise strides, leaving Lawrence to get a breather and focus on the big picture. The sense of protection from the holy relic had started to recede following his order, and they were quickly sinking into the \u201cspirit world,\u201d a space between reality and the deep sea.It was dangerous to do this, but historically, there are cases of ships returning from that place. As a member of the Explorers\u2019 Association, he had read numerous texts on the subject and various \u201csurvival guides\u201d written by survivors to prove it possible.How bad could it be, right? He only needed to let the White Oak dodge the storm at the edge of the spirit world and then use the surging power output of the advanced steam turbine to carry out a thrilling \u201cspirit drift.\u201d Then, if luck still cared for him, he could lead his crew back to the human world.Afterward, he only needs to hand over the damn \u201cAnomaly 099\u201d in storage to the officials of the city-state of Pland. From then on, he swore he would never get mixed up with this business again.Things couldn\u2019t get worse\u2026.Lawrence tries to comfort himself by muttering this until he sees the three-masted galleon larger than the White Oak. The other ship had suddenly emerged on the surface of the sea, and it was charging head-on into them like an indomitable beast!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Burning green flames spanned across the wooden hull, and the sails were so overpowering and ghostly that they struck a chord of the undead kind.\u201cWe\u2019re going to crash!!!\u201d Some crewmember shouted. They are not one to shy away from danger, but this was too much for their mortal souls.While most ran around like headless chickens looking for a place to hide, some stayed and grasped onto whatever they could find. However, a few had begun to pray and chant to the storm goddess Gomona or the lord of death Bart\u00f3k.In this boundless sea, the blessings of the gods may have waned, but only the power of these two gods granted some form of protection for their souls.But not all the crew members were losing their cool. The first mate had set his eyes on the captain, someone whom he trusted the most. Dangers always accompanied the endless sea, and in dire situations like these, the captain\u2019s experience always determined the life and death of its crew. Since Captain Lawrence had over thirty years of experience, he\u2019s the best bet anyone could make.Unfortunately, to the first mate\u2019s disappointment, there\u2019s only fear and shock on the captain\u2019s face right now.Acting as if he\u2019s completely unaware of the danger coming at the White Oak, the old captain stared so hard at the emerging galleon that he nearly snapped off the wheel. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s the Vanished\u2026\u201d\u201cCa\u2026 Captain?!\u201d The first mate got startled by the name. Like everyone who made a living on the sea, he\u2019s heard many stories from older and more superstitious sailors. \u201cWhat did you just say?! That\u2026.\u201d\u201cThe Vanished!!!\u201d Captain Lawrence did not seem to hear his first mate\u2019s cry and continued to stare ahead. By the time he regained any semblance of control, the White Oak had already plowed into the Vanished!Almost all the sailors screamed, but the expected earth-shattering crash did not come. Instead, the burning green ship of ghostly nature directly went into the White Oak\u2019s body and intertwined with each other. This naturally drew wide eyes from the crew, who were still trembling all over from the contact.Lawrence also watched this happen, but when his eyes caught sight of his first mate in front of himself, the man had transformed into an ethereal body as the flame engulfed the guy. As for the priest next to the praying table, the flames didn\u2019t consume the cleric, but instead bounced off the flickering white blessing protecting him.Then the flames devoured the old captain as well. A powerful sense of weariness, obedience, and fear filled his whole body. This activated the protective sea charm he prepared ahead of time, allowing Lawrence to maintain some part of his sanity while he passed through the moving ghost ship\u2019s hull and cabins.There were ancient wooden pillars of burning green fire in there, rotten ropes and barnacles, and a vast storage room housing all sorts of strange things that should\u2019ve been lying deep under the sea. But things changed when he entered the captain\u2019s quarter of the Vanished. It was luxurious by any standards, but the wooden goat head figurine ruined any sense of wealth with its ominous presence.Twisted and glowing, the goat head stared indifferently into Lawrence\u2019s eyes like it was watching prey.Eventually, Lawrence couldn\u2019t take it anymore from the intense glare and flinched upwards. That\u2019s when the two captains met. Tall and cursed looking as one might expect, Duncan was still holding the steering wheel of the Vanished with his imposing self of ghostly nature.The old Lawrence knew this was it. Closing his eyes in resignation, the old sailor understood the Vanished had come for its booty, and they were that prize.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to take everyone away. Take me and let my crew go.\u201d He shot open his eyes and mustered enough courage to make any parent proud.But the tall ghostly figure did not answer him but instead cast a curious gaze at whatever small mortal captain whom dared to bargain with himself.\u201cThey all have wives and children!\u201d Lawrence shouts in desperation.The flaming undead finally reacted and began to move that jaw like it was saying something. Unfortunately, the loud whistling wind around them had utterly overtaken the sentence in the ears of the mortals.\u201cWhat did you say?! The wind is too strong for me to hear!!\u201dThe next second, a loud noise blasted into Lawrence\u2019s ears, mixed in with the wind and cries of the sailors outside. Finally, it\u2019s over, the green flame had faded away under the afterglow of the light, and the remaining hull of the Vanished had dissipated into the murky fog behind the White Oak.Gasping at the release, Lawrence immediately checked his body and found everything had returned to normal. The flesh that burned off had returned, and the priest lying next to the praying table was still breathing heavily. They\u2019re all alive!\u201cCaptain! The ship, the Vanished is gone!\u201d The first mate yelled with an incredible voice.Lawrence was distracted and delayed his response: \u201cDid\u2026 he let us go?\u201dThe first mate didn\u2019t hear him clearly and asked again: \u201cCaptain? What did you say?\u201d\u201cThat Captain Duncan\u2026\u201d Lawrence muttered subconsciously but then slapped himself as if he had accidentally mentioned some forbidden word. Jerking up to face his first mate: \u201cFast, roll call the entire crew! I want to see who\u2019s missing from the White Oak!\u201dThe first mate immediately nodded and was ready to carry out the order when Lawrence added another sentence: \u201cAnd make sure to see if there\u2019s anyone extra on the ship!\u201dThe first mate got taken aback by the second half but promptly understood with intense fear in those eyes. He kept whispering the storm goddess\u2019s name while he turned for the deck and rang the gathering bell.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Then looking out the window, the old captain saw they were still in the thick of the fog and far from safety. Nevertheless, the sight of that terrifying ghost ship being gone was enough to satisfy him for now.Next, he must determine exactly what the Vanished took from the White Oak\u2014or what it left behind.And it must be determined as shortly as possible.He simply did not dare to let the ship back into the real world without ruling out all the hidden dangers \u2013 there are things, if brought, would cause catastrophic damage to the real world. On the contrary, he also didn\u2019t want to extend their stay in the spirit world less there be an irreversible effect on his crew.Eventually the noise from above deck brought him back from his thoughts. Looking up to examine the holy cleric and the incense burner, he asks with concern in his voice: \u201cMr. Ron, how stable are we right now?\u201dThe priest heaved incessantly as he coughed like those who\u2019s been stricken with illness. Then taking out a compass from his chest pocket, the priest etches some sort of sacred symbol with his finger at the air and silently chants a spell to make the arrow spin until it stops at a certain position.\u201cWe\u2019re floating somewhere in-between the surface and the spirit world, slightly closer to the real world so the influence of the depths is minimal\u2026.\u201d The priest then got all confused after staring down at the compass arrow, \u201cStrange\u2026 we are completely stable here despite the relic being turned off. We\u2019re not sinking at all\u2026. Uuoomph, ooomph\u2026\u201d\u201cMaybe the \u2018collision\u2019 of the Vanished actually knocked us onto a safe route,\u201d Lawrence shook his head with a wry smile, trying to enliven the mood with a bad joke. \u201cI heard there are some delicate balance points in the spirit world that can keep us from being pulled into the deeper parts\u2026\u201d\u201cMr. Captain, this joke is bad even for you,\u201d said the priest with a grin before breaking out in more wheezing coughs. \u201cIn any case, what happened today must be reported to the Church\u2026 The appearance of the Vanished is no small matter. There have been sightings of the Vanished for decades in the past, but never have we been able to confirm it like this. Oh bless the goddess for keeping us safe. Captain, you and your crew need to be psychologically prepared for when we return to Pland. None of you will be able to sail again in the near future.\u201d\u201cYou do not need to remind me Mr. Ron, I understand the authorities and the Church will not want a ship that\u2019s suffered the visit of the Vanished to leave their sight so quickly. For the safety of all, I intend to make a report to both parties and the Explorers Association\u2026. Alas, I also need to make a report to my terrible wife. I\u2019m sure she will have quite the tongue lashing for me when I get back\u2026\u201d Captain Lawrence pressed his forehead hard, and after a long sigh he waved the pain away, \u201cWithout further ado, you need to rest now, and until we return to port, this ship needs the blessing of the goddess.\u201dThe priest nodded at that, and soon the first mate had returned to the cabin as well.\u201cThere are no missing aboard, and there are no new people,\u201d the first mate reported as soon as they met without waiting for the captain\u2019s question, \u201cI personally examined the sailors assembled on deck and went to the boiler room to check the mechanics who remained there. They could all accurately pronounce the names of the gods they believed in.\u201d\u201cNot a single one?\u201d Lawrence\u2019s eyes widened in surprise. This should have been good news, but he couldn\u2019t believe things would be so well, \u201cWhat about the holy relic?\u201d\u201cThe relic is functioning as normal,\u201d the first mate nodded at once, \u201cthe navigator is preparing incense and essential oils for burning. We await your orders, Captain.\u201dLawrence listened in disbelief and once again couldn\u2019t stop muttering, \u201c\u2026 Did he really spare our ship?\u201d\u201cGood luck is in our favor, Captain.\u201d The first mate spreads his hands, \u201cWe didn\u2019t lose anyone. Perhaps that ghost captain only happens to pass by and our encounter is an accident.\u201d\u201cDo you believe this yourself?\u201d Lawrence immediately glanced at his first mate with a face, \u201cIf good luck really favors us, we wouldn\u2019t have met at all\u2026\u201dHalfway through his words, a rush of footsteps suddenly sounded outside before the cabin door swung open. A sweaty sailor promptly came before Lawrence with a look of dread.\u201cCaptain! Anomaly 099 is missing!!\u201dThere was an instant silence in the cab, and everyone was looking at each other. Somehow though, Lawrence only got a sense of relief at this news.This is too great. We\u2019ve finally found the problem on the ship!But then he controlled the expression on his face and strode out the cabin with his first mate at the wheel. The old captain must confirm this immediately as he led the way forward to the deepest part of the steamship.Soon, a special cabin came before their eyes.The door of this cabin had dense occult symbols engraved on the frame, and the whole piece seems to be forged from black iron. The whole setup acted like a closed-off cage meant to preserve whatever\u2019s held inside.Lawrence first confirmed there was no damage to the symbols on the door, then looked up again towards the \u201crelic room\u201d one level above this one. This arrangement was to make sure the content of 009 wouldn\u2019t pollute the rest of the ship and drag them \u201cdeep\u201d into the sea.But it was in such an arrangement \u2013 where both barrier and insurance remained intact \u2013 that the critical cargo escorted by the White Oak went missing.Lawrence inhaled deeply and unsealed the lock, pushing the heavy iron door inward with force.Inside the sealed room, the lights were bright, and the gas lamps hanging on the four columns illuminated the center with no blind spots to see. Yet, the \u201cgoods\u201d that should\u2019ve been here had disappeared, leaving only a few crisscrossing chains and some gray-white ashes scattered on the surrounding floorboard.The lead deckhand\u2019s voice spoke from behind: \u201cAccording to the seal requirements of anomaly 099. The room was always lit, and every two hours, a crew member would come in to re-reinforce the chains around the \u2018coffin\u2019 and sprinkle ashes on the floor. But when the ghost ship appeared, because of the chaos, the sailor who was supposed to be on duty did not enter the room in time. It was almost seven minutes late when we discovered 099\u2019s disappearance\u2026.\u201d\u201cJust seven minutes won\u2019t cause that thing to get out of control. The seals we placed here aren\u2019t for decoration. At worst, the coffin would only be able to move about in the room.\u201d Lawrence frowned and shook his head, \u201cWe know it\u2019s missing for sure and has left the ship\u2026. This is not the fault of the sailor.\u201dThe deckhand appears a little nervous, \u201cThen your meaning is\u2026\u201d\u201cIt must be the Vanished,\u201d Lawrence said in a deep voice, \u201cand the \u2018captain\u2019 took Anomaly 099 with him\u2026\u201dSpeaking of this, he paused and sighed softly: \u201cPerhaps we should be thankful that the Vanished only wanted that thing only and didn\u2019t take any of our lives.\u201dThe deckhand met his captain\u2019s gaze, then around the empty seal room, he finally spoke with hesitancy, \u201cBut\u2026 how will we tell the authorities that we lost their important cargo?\u201dLawrence didn\u2019t get fazed by the mention and patted the man\u2019s shoulder.\u201cThe Vanished is a natural disaster, and we have maritime insurance.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 Does the insurance company pay for this?\u201d\u201cIf they won\u2019t then we will ask the Explorers Association to issue a new bounty for the Vanished\u2026\u201d\u201cCaptain, aren\u2019t you a little\u2026\u201d\u201cShut up.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His body had regained its flesh, and the deck restored to its original state without the green flame.But in a mysterious and inexorably way, he felt that many things were different now.He could feel that something had changed the moment he grasped the helmsman of the Vanished, that the green flame had connected him to the ship and even to the sea itself. Take the floorboards beneath his feet for example \u2013 it\u2019s become a part of him, an extension of his feet.Closing his eyes slowly, Duncan taps into his newfound extensions for a swing: he could still hear the creepy murmurs of nothingness coming from the Vanished, the newly lit white embers of flame in the captain\u2019s quarter, and the battering waves against the ship\u2019s hull. However, he discovered one thing that wasn\u2019t there before \u2013 a sense of being watched by some dark shadows. When he tried to locate where this was coming from, the other side immediately backed away and disappeared\u2026.Opening his eyes again, he heaves a soft sigh and summons up the ghostly sails on the mast. From this point forwards, he\u2019s truly become the ship\u2019s captain. There\u2019s no turning back after he made the decision to helm the wheel.\u201cCaptain, we are floating up from the edge of the spirit world and will soon return to the real world.\u201d The voice of the goat head came from the side, but it was not through the copper pipe used for communication on the ship but directly inside Duncan\u2019s mind. Thankfully the goat stopped being so annoying when talking about serious businesses, \u201cOur luck is quite good. The deepest we went was at the bottom of the spirit world so the ship isn\u2019t affected in any way.\u201dThe real world, the spiritual sea, the deep sea, and the subspace that seems to be even deeper than the previous three\u2026 Duncan didn\u2019t know what these strange words were exactly, nor did he know their true meaning, only that it\u2019s popping up in his head and an indication of what was happening in this world.Nevertheless, one thing\u2019s certain in Duncan\u2019s mind. Whenever the goat head called himself \u201cCaptain,\u201d the attitude from the gargoyle figurine changed. Though subtle, but changed. In fact, Duncan was so certain that if he revealed himself to be \u201cZhou Ming\u201d right now, a man from another world, the goat head would still obey his orders regardless of the truth.But after a little hesitation, he backed down and didn\u2019t want to test this theory, nor did he ask the goat about the spirit world, deep sea, and subspace. Sure, a few days ago, he was anxious and uneasy about being here, but the situation no longer made him insecure and worried.For one thing, there are other \u201cpeople\u201d in this world, other ships, and other civilizations. This gave him hope and a vague idea for his future plans.\u201cThat ship was mechanically powered\u2026 and the Vanished is more like an old-styled sail galleon warship from the previous era\u2026.\u201d Duncan muttered to himself and began brainstorming, \u201cBut not entirely mechanical either. There are some cabins of unknown significance on that ship, and the cabins were arranged as if they were some kind of sacrificial site with many strange patterns and symbols etched along the walls\u2026.\u201d\u201cGoat Head,\u201d Duncan said suddenly inside his brain. He did not know the goat head\u2019s name, so he called this out subconsciously, \u201cWhen I was \u2018passing\u2019 through that ship just now, the man who looked like a captain shouted at me. What did he say?\u201dThe goat\u2019s head seemed indifferent to being addressed in such a manner and gladly accepted the name: \u201cThe wind and waves are too big to hear clearly.\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t hear either?\u201d Duncan frowned, \u201c\u2026 I get the feeling from his expression that he\u2019s ready to die a tragic death with me or something. It must\u2019ve been really important for him to call out to me at that moment.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s normal for humans to react in that manner before you, Captain. This is especially true for sailors so it\u2019s no surprise. Don\u2019t worry, Captain, a tree need not heed the cries of a grasshopper\u2026.\u201dThe goat head replied as if it were a matter of course, but Duncan almost tripped over from the news. \u201cWanting to die with me is a normal reaction for humans?\u201dHe immediately regretted the sentence after uttering it aloud. It\u2019s inappropriate and would expose the flaw in his identity as the \u201ccaptain.\u201d However, the same couldn\u2019t be said for the goat head, which continued to act oblivious to the oddity in Duncan\u2019s behavior.\u201cIt is normal that they fear you,\u201d the tone of the goat head now sounded proud, \u201canyone who sails on the Boundless Sea should fear you, just as they fear the gods of old and the shadows of subspace. Speaking of shadows, did you know a brilliant engineer\u2026 or it could\u2019ve also been an agronomist or a foodie, the person once said something\u2026\u201dDuncan sensibly did not take up the topic because he was worried that he would not be able to continue the topic (of course, the most important reason remains to be the goat head\u2019s endless battering. If he caters to his talk, the annoyance will rise exponentially)\u201c\u2026\u2026 What is this thing?\u201d Duncan smartly changed the topic and asked with amazement. There\u2019s something outside the captain\u2019s quarter.It was a wooden box more than a man\u2019s length. The artistry looks to be very well-made with riveted and gold-plated reinforcement. There are also intricate patterns etched along the surface like some sort of hieroglyphic symbols. For sure, this box definitely wasn\u2019t on the Vanished before!The voice of the goat head went silent for a moment before sounding again: \u201c\u2026 I don\u2019t know, but it should be some sort of booty\u2026\u201d\u201cBooty?!\u201d Duncan didn\u2019t know how to react for a moment and walked around the box twice, \u201cThis thing looks like a coffin, but it\u2019s much more exquisite than an ordinary coffin\u2026 Wait, booty, you mean this thing was \u2018taken\u2019 from that ship?!\u201d\u201cA successful hunt, Captain,\u201d the goat head said in a serious yet complimenting voice, \u201cit is expected that the Vanished return with some booty after a voyage.\u201dDuncan subconsciously dropped his jaws in shock. What success? He had no intention of taking anything from the other ship to begin with!But thinking about it, saying what he thought wouldn\u2019t conform to his \u201ccaptain\u201d image, and more importantly, the mechanical ship had disappeared into the thick of the fog. Then recalling the white-bearded captain\u2019s death glare and the stuff about dying with him, Duncan understood he much rather take his chances with this box.Coming closer to this suspicious coffin, he finally noticed the lid \u2013 it\u2019s loosened by something and opened beforehand.Though hesitant, he placed his hand on the wooden box \u2013 at least, he needed to figure out how that spirit world ship placed this item here.Stronger than he had imagined, his hand easily lifted the lid off after a little shove. There, lying inside, shocked him.\u201cA person?\u201dIn the wooden box, quietly lay a beautiful young woman \u2013 long silver-white hair spread like liquid mercury in the box. Her appearance could only be described as exquisite and flawless, and she was faintly carrying a certain noble and detached temperament with that gorgeous purplish-black court dress.A sleeping doll\u2026.\u201cNo wait, this is really a doll!\u201dOn closer inspection, Duncan suddenly noticed the inhuman joint structure of the other party.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In fact, its as if the doll would come alive at any second now. But this was just an illusion on his part. The doll wouldn\u2019t and remained completely unresponsive to its surroundings.But after a long wary observation, Duncan finally came to the decision the gorgeous goth doll in the box wouldn\u2019t suddenly jump up to surprise himself, which was slightly relieving on his part.Then he frowned and asked the goat head again: \u201cWhat do you think of this situation?\u201d\u201cThis must have been an important cargo escorted by the previous ship,\u201d replied the goat head at once. Though it had previously stated that it did not know about the strange wooden coffin that had suddenly appeared on deck, it was clearly more experienced with the affairs of the sea than Duncan. \u201cThere are symbols pointing to the gods, and the box is surrounded by pins to secure chains in place. This all indicate that the thing was sealed at some point. To transport something sealed on the Boundless Sea is a very risky thing to do, so I believe that ship we encountered must\u2019ve some background to attempt such a ordeal.\u201d\u201cSeal?\u201d Duncan\u2019s eyes twitched at the idea. If the coffin had been sealed before coming aboard the Vanished, wouldn\u2019t that mean whatever\u2019s inside had been unsealed now? Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to remove the lid so easily.\u201cFor the ordinary and fragile person, this might be dangerous. However, it\u2019s of no threat to you if it could be sealed by some special skill. Captain, you are far more dangerous than this anomaly.\u201dDuncan was speechless and became tied inside over the thought of him being more dangerous than a creepy coffin on the ship. It didn\u2019t help either when the one flattering him was an evil and spooky gargoyle figurine with a goat face.After sighing in his heart that he still needed to be cautious in gathering knowledge, Duncan frowned some more and looked at the doll one last time before making up his mind: \u201cI should throw this back into the sea.\u201dThere was a hint of hesitation in his heart when he said this, especially when looking at the doll.This wasn\u2019t due to the doll being too beautiful, but rather because it\u2019s too realistic looking. A sleeping beauty like in the Snow White story. Who could bear to do such a thing? But this hesitation eventually strengthened his resolve.As a rational and cautious person, he could not leave such a potential danger next to himself, especially when this world had so many unnatural and strange things. What if this doll was one of those strange things? Having the goat head was enough, he didn\u2019t need to add a second anomaly to his troubles.Covering up the coffin with the lid again, Duncan made sure to find a hammer and nailed it tight for safe measures.Finally, he pushed the \u201ccoffin\u201d with the doll inside to the edge of the deck.\u201cYou can dispose of your booty at will Captain, but I will still make a respectful and humble suggestion: you don\u2019t need to be so cautious, the Vanished hadn\u2019t added any loot to its treasure trove for a long time\u2026\u201d The goat says in his head.\u201cShut up.\u201d Duncan simply cut off the annoyance and kicked the coffin hard.The heavy box teetered a bit at the edge of the deck before falling straight into the sea, which had returned to its normal dullish blue color, and made a huge splash at impact. Not relieved yet, Duncan made sure the box left his view completely before issuing out a sigh of relief. Then looking around, he confirmed the fog had mostly dissipated as well, indicating the Vanished had detached itself from the \u201cspirit world\u201d and returned to the real world.Duncan immediately scanned around for signs of the steam ship. According to his estimation, it shouldn\u2019t have been too long since the two ships met, meaning it could still be within visual view. But he found nothing, not even a faded shape of the steam ship.\u201c\u2026\u2026 Is this also because of this strange sea? Or is it related to the so-called \u2018spirit voyage\u2019?\u201dDuncan muttered in his heart, but soon his attention was drawn to something else \u2013 he saw a glimmer of light in the depths of the clouds above the sea that had never dispersed before.As if a thick drapery had been lifted from his world, the sea surface now glistened like one would expect from a morning rise. This picture emotionally touched Duncan\u2019s heart. Ever since he learned of \u201cthis side\u2019s\u201d existence, he hadn\u2019t seen the sun since being trapped in his apartment. And now, he finally got to welcome the sun with open arms again\u2026.But it didn\u2019t happen. The expected warmth of the morning rise didn\u2019t come; instead, he saw a golden sphere that left him utterly frozen on the spot.The light was in no way as dazzling as he expected. The sun was a round radiant orb of yellow, but circling around it were two concentrical rings of intricate runes that gave off the impression of a shackle binding its prisoner..\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d He spoke softly with a low and somewhat cold voice.\u201cThat\u2019s the sun, of course, Captain.\u201d The voice of the goat head was as calm as ever.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, the image of the \u201csun\u201d remained deeply imprinted in his retina despite closing them.The sun wasn\u2019t supposed to be like that, but now, he had to accept the facts.He was in a foreign land, a place farther away than he could ever have imagined.Subconsciously turning his head back towards the door to the captain\u2019s quarter, Duncan knew he could go back, back to the apartment room where he\u2019s lived for so many years. But there\u2019s nothing there for him. Aside from the thick, murky grayish fog, what could he accomplish on that side from the thirty or so square feet of space?In reality, the \u201chome\u201d that he deemed familiar was no more than another lonely boat\u2014metaphorically speaking of course.In the long silence, the voice of the goat head came again and broke his moping: \u201cCaptain, where are we going next? Do you have any sailing plans in mind?\u201dSailing plans? How could Duncan have that kind of thing? Although he was eager to immediately formulate a perfect plan to explore the world and finalize the next voyage, he didn\u2019t have the slightest clue nor the knowledge to charter a route on the map.In fact, merely driving the Vanished had only come to him a few hours ago. Nevertheless, he still pondered the idea before replying: \u201cWhere did the ship that collided with us come from?\u201d\u201cYou mean those city-states? Which one do you wish to go?\u201d The voice of the goat head was a little surprised and then wanted to dissuade him, \u201cI suggest that you not go near the shipping lanes controlled by those city-states\u2026 At least not now. Despite you being the great Captain Duncan, the current state of the Vanished is\u2026. not as good as before. The garrisons patrolling those waters will certainly resist your offensive\u2026.\u201dDuncan became speechless for a while. He wanted to know what the real \u201cCaptain Duncan\u201d could\u2019ve done to warrant such hatred.Also, the euphemism from the goat head revealed to Duncan that the ship was never as well maintained as he initially thought \u2013 perhaps the main reason the ghost ship was on a long voyage had been due to the fear of returning to port in the civilized world.Duncan was a little distressed. He urgently needs to find a way to understand the world, and he must find a way to contact the \u201ccivilized society\u201d out there. Whether it was for his own survival in the long term or the mystery of finding a way to return \u201chome,\u201d he must figure out a way to stop this endless wandering. The issue was that the civilized society didn\u2019t seem to welcome him to the point that his very presence was enough to aggro a twenty-five-man raiding party to banish him to the abyss.Sighing at his own misfortune, Duncan wished there was at least a book on the Vanished at this moment \u2013 he lacks information, and the only source was the goat head.But then again\u2026 How come there is not even a book on this great ship?Sailing a long journey can be a stressful environment out at sea, that\u2019s why they always had some means to relieve themselves like reading or movies. Can the \u201creal Duncan\u201d be a\u2026. illiterate?Duncan casually asked this aloud since he couldn\u2019t help himself. Unexpectedly, the goat answered without hesitation: \u201cBooks? Reading at sea is a dangerous thing. The shadows in the depths and the ones hiding in the subspace are all waiting for the mortal mind to show an opening. The \u2018classics\u2019 from the church are fine, but those are so boring that it\u2019s better to wash the deck\u2026.. But Captain, haven\u2019t you always been uninterested in the things from the church?\u201dDuncan immediately raised an eyebrow over the news.How can reading a book at sea be life-threatening? Only the scriptures from the church are fine? What sort of sickness down this Boundless Sea have?He got a little more knowledge about this world, but at the same time, he also got more questions about its makeup. Suppressing his desire to ask again, he came before the ship\u2019s side and stared into the distant horizon.If discounting the eerie appearance of the sun shining down on the rippling water surface, this glistening sparkle of the sea would indeed be considered beautiful.\u201cI\u2019d like to hear your advice,\u201d Duncan said cautiously to the goat head, \u201cI\u2019m a little tired of this aimless voyage, perhaps\u2026\u201dHalfway through his words, a strange \u201cfeeling\u201d suddenly swept up from the bottom of his heart, and this feeling came from the connection between him and the \u201cVanished\u201d. It\u2019s as if some \u201cforeign object\u201d suddenly touched the ship before he heard a \u201cbang\u201d noise in the direction of the stern.Duncan frowned, then pulled out the flintlock handgun and one-handed pirate saber from his waist. He wasted no time and ran over to check where he saw something lying quietly on deck \u2013 it was the ornate wooden coffin with the weird doll again\u2026..A creepy feeling welled up in Duncan\u2019s head. From what he saw, the box was still wet from floating in the seawater, but more importantly, the nails he used to make sure the lid was sealed had been pried off!After several minutes of vigilant confrontation, Duncan finally made up his mind. Clutching the flintlock gun in one hand and the saber in the other, he used the blade tip to push the partially cracked lid aside with force.The gothic doll comes into view with an audible creek \u2013 it\u2019s still as lifeless and beautiful as before.Duncan stared at the thing for several seconds, then spoke in a deep and serious voice (he believed to be commanding at the time): \u201cIf you are alive, then get up and talk to me.\u201dAfter saying it twice in a row, the doll still didn\u2019t move.Duncan made a deep frown before finally lightening up his voice: \u201cVery well, that leaves me no choice but to toss you back overboard.\u201dAfter saying this, he did not hesitate to cover the lid again and then took the tools to nail the coffin up with even more vigor and nails. This time, he grabbed some iron chains he found in a corner to keep it secured firmly.Clapping his hand in satisfaction once confirmed he\u2019d done it properly, Duncan nods at the handiwork and circles the box several times: \u201cI like to see you get out of it this time.\u201dWithout hesitation, he kicked the box into the sea again.Sighing a breath of relief as he watched the box float away. He was ready to move on after waiting a minute when he snapped around with his head.\u201cMaybe I should\u2019ve strapped a cannonball to it or something\u2026\u201dDuncan muttered and then turned away for real this time.\u201cYou\u2019re a little harsh on that lady.\u201d The sound of the goat head came into his head.\u201cShut up \u2013 how can you call a cursed doll \u2018Lady\u2019?\u201d\u201cIt does look like a cursed doll\u2026 But what curse on the vast sea can compare to the Vanished and its great Captain Duncan? Captain, that lady is quite gentle and harmless in fact\u2026\u201dDuncan: \u201c\u2026\u201dWhy is this goat head so proud when it comes to the curse and notoriety of the Vanished and Captain Duncan?Perhaps sensing that Duncan was in a bad mood, the goat head immediately changed the subject: \u201cCaptain, you said you wanted to hear my advice before, specifically\u2026\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s talk about it later. I need to take a break. I lost my energy by sailing the Vanished in the spirit world before, so you should be quiet.\u201d\u201cYes, Captain.\u201dDuncan returned to the captain\u2019s quarters and sat in front of the mapping table where the chart remained.The next second, his gaze suddenly froze.The chart seemed to have undergone a subtle change\u2014the grayish-white patches that had originally covered the entire drawing, as if they were constantly squirming, seemed to have dissipated a little, and the sea surface around the Vanished was becoming clearer!Is this map updating the surrounding waters\u2019 information in real-time as the Vanished sails?This immediately got Duncan\u2019s full attention. However, his concentration was soon interrupted.In the depths of his soul, the Vanished once again sent a signal of \u201ccontact with a foreign object\u201d before his ears heard the loud \u201cbang\u201d from the deck.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The droplets of water on the edge leaking next to his feet confirmed he wasn\u2019t dreaming \u2013 he really did throw the darn thing into the sea not long ago.Such a strange situation was enough to make anyone feel the chills, but somehow Duncan\u2019s mood at the moment was calmer than he had imagined.Perhaps it\u2019s due to already being on the eerie ghost ship, or because he had recently experienced a thrilling \u201cdrift into the spirit world\u201d and a collision with a steamboat, or perhaps it\u2019s due to the evil-looking goat head for several days. Regardless, Duncan seemed to have grown an immunity to strange supernatural phenomenas in this world.In fact, as early as the last time he threw this \u201ccursed doll\u201d into the sea, he had vaguely guessed that things wouldn\u2019t end so easily.He lowered his head, not surprisingly noticing that the iron nails and chains were gone, then used the tip of his pirate blade to pry open the lid again.The gorgeous gothic doll still lay quietly in the center of the red velvet lining, hands folded, idyllic, and elegant.But this time Duncan clearly noticed that the corners of the other side\u2019s skirt seemed to have traces of being wet by the sea with a faint smell of the ocean from inside the coffin.Up to now, this strange doll does not seem to have any other out-of-line or dangerous behavior except the back and forth, but just the \u201cgoing and returning\u201d was already enough to attribute it to what they call a \u201ccursed item\u201d.Duncan watched the doll for another good while, then suddenly broke the silence with a smirk: \u201cI suddenly want to satisfy my curiosity\u2026\u201dWhen the words ended, he turned and walked to the entrance of the cabin not far away and left the doll alone on the deck.Although he was wary of the doll and did not want to leave the other party by his side, but Duncan had confidence the many living creatures\u201d on the ship would be enough to deal with anything that might arise.And he has some \u201cpreparations\u201d to make during this time.Duncan crossed the aft of the deck, opened the wooden door leading to the lower deck, stepped onto the wooden staircase that was god knows how old, and came to the cabin under the deck, which belonged to the \u201cupper cabin\u201d where the cannons, powder kegs, and iron balls were placed.As he swept his gaze over the things that looked quite old at a glance, an idea suddenly came to his mind.Can these cannons reload themselves too and fire when he wills it?What about the freshwater tanks on board? Do they also refill on their own?What about the damaged places during a battle? Are they also self-repairing? Or rather\u2026 does this ship even have the concept of \u201cdamage\u201d?The questions came out one by one, but he couldn\u2019t think of an explanation for any one of them.Duncan knew very well that he knew too little about the ship. Although he had explored it to some extent over the past few days, he only had a general understanding of its superstructure. Those deeper areas were far too eerie and menacing for him to explore with the limited time he had on hand.But now, the possibilities were riling up his curiosity to a new high.This was his ship, and he deserves to know about the \u201cVanished.\u201dThis may be a change largely due to him taking control of that steering wheel, but he didn\u2019t know that. Shaking his head, the guy left the idea of exploration for another time and returned to his initial plan.Armed with several iron shell balls, Duncan returned to the aft of the deck and made a peculiar face. \u201cDid she make any movement?\u201d\u201cNot at all,\u201d came the voice of the goat head at once that sounded far too similar to someone that\u2019s been muffled for far too long, \u201cthis lady is as quiet as she looks, and you should trust my judgment that she is completely harmless to you. Since she keeps coming back on board, it may indicate there is a connection between her and the Vanished. A great horticulturist once said\u2026\u201d\u201cShut up.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dIgnoring the thumping annoyance in his veins, Duncan stared expressionlessly at the doll in the coffin.I don\u2019t know if she really can\u2019t move, or if she\u2019s still pretending to be asleep, but regardless, I\u2019m going to find out.Solid cast iron was particularly heavy, and when executing traitors on a ship, a single cannonball strapped to the leg was the best way to ensure the seasoned sailor fed the fishes.For this occasion, Duncan decides to make it four before returning to the lower cabin for another four \u2013 making it a total of eight.Eight cannonballs, plenty to fill up the remaining space in the wooden box with that elegant doll sleeping at the center. Well, elegant wouldn\u2019t be the right word anymore, but creepy would definitely fit the bill.With great effort, Duncan sealed the lid off again and pushed the wooden coffin to the edge of the deck. Finally, with a spinning kick of his life, he shot the box right into the sea for the third time. This time, he made sure to witness it sinking into the depths with his own eyes.The voice of the goat head came into his mind then: \u201cCaptain, have you repented? If you regret throwing away the loot, the Vanished can still use its anchor to salvage the box again. Although the correct use of the anchor isn\u2019t meant for that, but the anchor says it can try\u2026.\u201d\u201cShut up.\u201d\u201cBut I see you\u2019ve been standing on the edge of the deck for a long time\u2026\u201d\u201cShut up.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dDuncan heaves a long sigh. He couldn\u2019t admit to the bootlicking goat head that his toe hurts from that spinning kick\u2026.So, with the painful sting still apparent in his shoe, he maintained the serious and majestic appearance of a captain overseeing the waters until many minutes later. Whether Duncan actually looked like a proper captain or not was one thing, but he\u2019s certain no one would mock him for it.After returning to his quarter and waiting quietly for a few more minutes, he estimated the timing should be about right and got to where the windows were. This spot was below the stern area, so he should be able to peer through the opening and see what he wanted.\u201cCaptain, you are\u2026\u201d The goat head couldn\u2019t help but ask after witnessing this odd behavior.Duncan stared intently at the sea surface and replied without looking up, \u201cI\u2019m wondering how that \u2018cursed doll\u2019 keeps coming back.\u201d\u201cErm\u2026 because she\u2019s a cursed doll, that\u2019s how?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 I appreciate your uncomprehensive attitude, but I think that even if she is a cursed doll, there must be some kind of process in her coming back on the ship. I suspect she\u2019s also able to communicate but refuses to do so. If I can grasp onto her reasoning, then perhaps we can stop this charade and get some words in.\u201dListening to Duncan\u2019s explanation, the goat head went quiet for a good two seconds like its contemplating the idea: \u201cCaptain, your energy\u2026. seem to have grown higher. That\u2019s a good sign! You haven\u2019t been in a good mood since you awoke from slumber. As your loyal first mate and second mate\u2026\u201d\u201cShut up.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dAfter the goat head had quieted down, Duncan focused his attention back on the sea surface.The \u201ccoffin\u201d seemed to have really sunk into the deep sea\u2026But with the experience of the previous two times, Duncan was extra patient this time. Silently calculating the time and silently observing in wait. Then it happened. The doll reappeared in his line of sight as he expected.Amid a wave, the delicate wooden box that looked like a coffin had become a makeshift boat with the gothic doll paddling the sides with her arms. Truly an imposing sight in how she managed such a feat against such waves.Naturally, Duncan was stunned for words at this sight.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Should Duncan be surprised that the doll was moving? Or should he be wowed by her arrogance to use a coffin as a rowing boat or surfboard? Regardless, the tenacity and determination of the doll to return aboard was something to behold. He had to give her credit for that.Then before Duncan had realized it, the doll had managed to come aboard, and this time he got the full show on how she managed it. By clinging onto some protruding wood from the stern, the doll was able to heave herself up with the coffin magically floating up beside herself. Ignoring the weight alone, the dexterity required for such a feat would put any acrobat to the test.Not letting this chance slide, he promptly hurried back to the deck.Apparently, the puppet doll didn\u2019t realize she had been caught red-handed and was continuing to get things in order. With a wave of a finger, the coffin slowly floated down beside her feet. That done, she began to sort out her now dripping dress and crawled inside the box with her feet first.But halfway through the climb, she stopped after hearing a audible click of a gun being unlocked, followed closely by a pirate sword that came up to her chin.The doll\u2019s movements instantly froze. She tried to rigidly turn her head, only to be confronted by a burning green-flamed ghost captain staring down at herself coldly.\u201cHumph, I caught you now, dolly~\u201dThe doll visibly trembled in front of Duncan\u2019s eyes and wanted to shrink away to avoid his gaze. However, what came of the nervous wreck were nothing more than clinks and clacks of joints too scared to move.Then her head fell off\u2026In front of Duncan, a beautiful head rolled next to his feet with sprawling silvery hair that mangled itself around the face. Funnily enough, the doll\u2019s body continued to move by grasping blankly into the air while pleading: \u201cHelp\u2026 Help\u2026 Help\u2026\u201dIt\u2019s no exaggeration to say that Duncan\u2019s heart had stopped beating \u2013 although he doubted his heart existed right now due to his flaming ghostly form. Nevertheless, watching a headless doll continuing to move still freaked him out.Finally, after much willpower and self-calming, Duncan used his brain to assess the situation. From what he found, the doll had more fear of him than he had of her. This instantly cleared the tenseness in his posture now that he knew the \u201cGreat Captain Duncan\u201d was still effective against cursed items.Putting the gun away while still holding the sword, Duncan picks up the doll\u2019s head with his free hand. Sure, he knows it\u2019s technically not a living thing, but just holding a talking head was enough to give him the creeps. It\u2019s just too weird no matter what he told himself.But alas, he restrained his inner urge to toss the head overboard and looked it in the eye: \u201cDo you want me to help you place it back on?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026 Yes\u2026 Yes\u2026\u201d\u201cAlright, you do it yourself.\u201d Duncan nodded and casually tossed the head into the other party\u2019s hand, which was grasping haphazardly at the air still.Surprisingly, those hands were extremely skillful and dexterous when playing catch. Once safely in her own arms, the gothic doll first sorted her silvery hair \u2013 somewhat messy from all the rolling \u2013 then snapped it back on the neck with an audible clean click.The whole process was smooth and flawless, meaning it was not the first time the doll had done this maneuver.Immediately after that, the doll\u2019s somewhat stiff face came alive, blinking those long batting eyelashes before issuing a long exhale: \u201cPhew~ I\u2019m alive again\u2026.\u201dDuncan: \u201c\u2026.\u201dNo matter how he thought about it, Duncan felt like he should say some curse word in a complaint, but after remembering his \u201cCaptain Duncan\u201d identity, he promptly lost the idea\u2014being exposed before this doll gave him nothing but bad vibes.\u201cVery good, now come with me. It\u2019s time we talked about why you keep coming aboard my ship.\u201d As he spoke, he scattered the ghost flames wrapped around his body and returned to his original appearance.Actively transforming into his \u201cghostly form\u201d had come naturally to him now. Nevertheless, it\u2019s far from what one would call skillful since this was the best he could do aside from steering the Vanished.The cursed doll obediently stood up from the coffin and was immediately surprised to see Duncan regain his human form: \u201cYou\u2026 are you not a ghost?\u201dDuncan glanced at her sideways: \u201cWhen necessary, I can be.\u201dThe doll didn\u2019t speak, only clasping her head in support like the awe in her eyes would pop the thing off again.Duncan didn\u2019t know why the cursed doll would make such a face for one, but he\u2019s not going to bash that misconception. Anything to help his image as the infamous ghost pirate that ruled the Boundless Sea.Turning away without looking back, he began to head for the captain\u2019s quarter while letting his connection with the Vanished tell him what was happening. The gothic doll was initially hesitant to follow, but that didn\u2019t last long once the \u201ccoffin\u201d floated up from the floorboard and moved with her.Under the gloomy gaze of the wooden goat head, the ghost captain and the cursed doll sat across from one another at the mapping table \u2013 the former relaxing in his reclining chair while the puppet fidgeted uncomfortably with the coffin floating behind her.There\u2019s no question the gothic doll was a true beauty from the surface level, but whenever Duncan looked at that figure, all he could see now was the incredible picture of a surfer riding the waves with a coffin\u2026.Sighing at his own silliness, he resumes his cold and imposing fa\u00e7ade: \u201cName?\u201d\u201cAlice.\u201d\u201cRace?\u201d\u201cPuppet Doll.\u201d\u201cOccupation?\u201d\u201cDoll\u2026 Why ask me this?\u201dDuncan thought for a moment: \u201cFor some basic understanding.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although the ghost captain in front of her had promised temporary safety, it didn\u2019t change the fact that the cursed doll was obviously uneasy in front of Duncan\u2019s naturally +10 threatening face. Also, the uncomfortable pinching of fingers and grasping of the skirt exposed her.On the other hand, Duncan remained momentarily silent and only observed the \u201clady\u201d in front of him.A doll driven by an unknown force, a \u201csupernatural individual\u201d who was not of flesh and blood but could walk and speak like an average person. If placed in his hometown, Alice would surely be kidnapped by some mad scientist and dissected for knowledge.Duncan didn\u2019t know what kind of category a doll-like Alice belonged to in this world, but in the process of exploring this world in the past few days, he\u2019s gotten enough information to make a guess. On this side, there are indeed \u201csupernatural existences,\u201d and there are things that science couldn\u2019t explain. As for the doll sitting in front of him\u2026.Duncan guessed that she likely belonged to a unique category of existences that\u2019s considered strange even in this already freaky world.His guess didn\u2019t come without supported facts, like that mechanical steamship that collided with the Vanished. From what he saw, those sailors were well trained and experienced. Even amidst great fear, many of them didn\u2019t leave their posts. Also, he didn\u2019t miss the strange rune markings inside the other ship, which were styled similar to the ones on Alice\u2019s coffin.In other words, the purpose of such a cutting-edge ship was most likely meant to be used as an escort\u2026 or \u201cescort\u201d for Alice the cursed doll.Duncan adjusted his posture and stared deeply at the uncomfortable Alice with his serious face\u2014there was no doubt that he had an incredible \u201cguest\u201d on his ship.But from another point of view, this puppet doll lady did not seem to be a terrible character, and her courage was lacking. After all, he didn\u2019t even utter a word, and the lady had already dropped her head in fright. If that\u2019s not a scaredy cat then what is?\u201cExcuse me\u2026\u201d Probably because the extended silence and gaze brought too much pressure, but Alice finally couldn\u2019t take it and broke the silence, \u201cAnd\u2026\u201d\u201cWhere are you from?\u201d Duncan withdrew his oppressive gaze and asked in a calmer tone.Alice was visibly stunned. As if reflecting on the meaning of Duncan\u2019s question, she took several seconds to respond by tapping her finger on the coffin: \u201cFrom here.\u201dDuncan\u2019s expression instantly froze from being dumbfounded: \u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cOf course I know you\u2019ve been lying in this box before,\u201d he coughed awkwardly, \u201cbut what I\u2019m asking is where you\u2019re coming from\u2014the location, understand? Do you have a hometown? Or something that can be called a place of departure?\u201dAlice thought about it again and shook her head calmly, \u201cI can\u2019t remember exactly.\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t remember?\u201d\u201cWhere do you believe a doll comes from?\u201d Alice folded her arms around the chest to speak earnestly: \u201cMost of my memories were me lying in that box when I\u2019m being transported. Occasionally I can sense the vague presence of people walking around or guarding the box\u2026. Ah, I also remember overhearing some whispering conversations of the men guarding my box. From what I gathered, they all sounded fearful and nervous about the topic\u2026\u201dDuncan cocked an eyebrow, \u201cTalking about something? What are they talking about around you?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just boring trivial stuff.\u201d\u201cBut I am curious,\u201d Duncan said seriously\u2014he believed that it might really be nothing more than bland, trivial things, but that\u2019s exactly the stuff he needs. Anything to help him gain a better picture of this world.\u201c\u2026\u2026 Fine then. The most commonly heard name is Anomaly 099\u2014they seem to use this name when referring to me and my wooden box. But I\u2019m not fond of it. I have a name called Alice. Besides the occasional conversation about seals and curses or something, most of their words are a blur to me. I\u2019m always asleep in my box, so I didn\u2019t bother to pay attention to what\u2019s happening outside.\u201dThe doll spoke unhurriedly, and then, as if suddenly remembering something, added: \u201cBut what I have heard recently is still clear in my head. It must have been before I came to your ship, and the voices of those talking outside the box frequently mentioned a place, the city-state of Pland, which seemed to be their destination\u2026 perhaps my destination too?\u201d\u201cThe City-State of Pland?\u201d Duncan\u2019s eyes lowered in thought and silently wrote down this name in his heart.He finally learned something useful again. However, he did not know when this useful information would come in handy.Then he lifted his head and stared at the puppet lady in front of him again: \u201cWhat else?\u201d\u201cBesides this, I spent most of my time sleeping, Mr. Captain,\u201d said Miss Puppet with a serious and pruned face. \u201cWhen you are locked in a large coffin-like box, surrounded by groggy whispers, what else can you do aside from sleeping? Am I supposed to do sit-ups or something?\u201dThe corners of Duncan\u2019s mouth twitched.He couldn\u2019t deny the doll gave off an air of dignity and elegance when her head was screwed on right, but the stuff she said was more in line with her image of a surfer riding the waves \u2013 brunt and forceful.He needs to quickly build a new image of Miss Alice in his mind less he gets surprised some more by her manner of speaking.But on the surface, he still maintained the image of the calm and majestic Captain Duncan: \u201cSo, apart from being groggy in the wooden box, you know nothing about the outside world? Not the changes in today\u2019s times, nor where the port city is?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m afraid so, Captain,\u201d miss puppet doll nodded solemnly, and then her eyes widened slightly as if she had thought of something scary. Then, acting all nervous in the face, \u201cSo\u2026 are you going to throw me off the ship again? Because I don\u2019t have much value anymore?\u201dBefore Duncan could speak, he heard Alice talk again, \u201cFine, I understand this is your ship after all, but can you please stop stuffing cannonballs into the box this time? Seriously\u2026 Eight iron balls are too much\u2026\u201dIt could be seen that the doll lady wasn\u2019t in a very good mood and was actively suppressing her displeasure at the manner in which she\u2019s been treated.Duncan was also very embarrassed by the last remark. Mainly regarding the fact that he presumed Alice to be those cursed items from the horror movies. If he had known she could converse like a normal person, Duncan swears he would never do something so rude as stuffing eight cannonballs in that box.However, Duncan had been known to have thick skins, and being the shameless asshole that he was, he ignored the blaming words and continued the conversation. \u201cI still haven\u2019t decided on tossing you overboard or not yet; after all, you always seem to have a way of returning aboard. I am curious though, why do you insist on returning to the Vanished? I can tell you\u2019re afraid of me, and you\u2019re afraid of the ship. If so, why not stay away from the danger?\u201d\u201cIs this ship called the Vanished? Alright, you caught me. I am indeed a little afraid of you and the ship. But compared to this, isn\u2019t the depths of the open sea more dangerous?\u201d Alice silently met the ghost captain\u2019s gaze.From her field of vision, the tall and imposing man was shrouded by an endless murky darkness, which overlapped with the real image of the cabin and created a seemingly twisted picture of two overlapping realities. However, compared to the horrors lurking within the \u201cdepths\u201d of the Boundless Sea, she would much rather pick the former instead of the latter.\u201cIn this world, is there anything more frightening than the deep sea?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

So, Duncan had no doubt about detecting the fears in the doll\u2019s eyes and the truth of the matter \u2013 there has to be something far more dangerous than himself lurking under the water.In retrospect, this also made him more curious about what\u2019s out there. What\u2019s the land like? Or what was considered normal?However, the doll in front of him didn\u2019t have the answer. From what he suspects, the groggy state of her memory must\u2019ve been mostly due to the seal placed on the coffin. Following that clue, the \u201ccursed doll\u201d must be deeply feared by civilized society.\u201cAgain, you don\u2019t remember where you came from, and you can\u2019t remember what you\u2019ve been through in the past, right?\u201d He asks again to confirm.\u201cI don\u2019t remember,\u201d Alice replied very seriously, \u201cI\u2019ve been lying in this big box for as long as I can remember. Though I don\u2019t know why there is always a group of nervous people around me like I would come out, but honestly speaking, your act of putting nails on my box to seal it is quite nice in comparison. Although you did place eight cannonballs afterward, at least you didn\u2019t pour lead into it.\u201dThis time, Duncan did not care about Alice\u2019s useless remark and continued to ask, \u201cWhere did your name come from? Who gave you that name? If you really never left the box and never had contact with anyone else, why did you have a name? Could it be that you gave it to yourself?\u201dAlice was suddenly stunned.She seemed lost, remaining in a daze for over ten seconds to the point that Duncan got worried there was a self-destruct setting inside the doll. Thankfully Alice eventually came back to her senses: \u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t remember. I know my name is Alice, but the name wasn\u2019t coined by me. I\u2026\u201dShe muttered in confusion and subconsciously supported her head with those hands, which made Duncan freak out in the face. Quickly shouting before it\u2019s too late: \u201cAlright, if you don\u2019t remember then that\u2019s fine, just don\u2019t pull your head off\u2026.\u201dAlice: \u201c\u2026\u201dAfter this, Duncan asked many more questions, but unfortunately, most of them were fruitless.As Miss Doll herself has said, she spent most of her conscious time in that \u201ccoffin,\u201d maintaining a state of alternating sleep and partial awareness of her surroundings. In the end, her knowledge of trivial matters could hardly piece together the outline of the world.But even so, Duncan wasn\u2019t without gain\u2014in his conversation with Alice, he identified at least a few things:There\u2019s a power structure in this world called the \u201ccity-state.\u201d A word that repeatedly appears in the narration of the doll lady and constitutes almost the entirety of her journey was a place called Pland.It seemed to be a thriving place, and sailors said that it \u201cheld importance on many shipping routes\u201d through their conversations.Secondly, Alice also has the name \u201cAnomaly 099\u201d, which seems to be an \u201cofficial\u201d title given to her by the civilized world. As for \u201cAlice,\u201d there doesn\u2019t seem to be anyone else who knows this name aside from these two.Lastly, Alice had been being transferred from one city-state to another, and from how things looked, she doesn\u2019t seem to be the only \u201cabnormal\u201d being moved in such a manner. Apparently, the guards had mentioned other \u201cseals\u201d on occasion, which Duncan could confirm by the other storage rooms that had similar runes etched along the walls on that steamship.Going by all these clues, Duncan could boldly speculate such transfers are a necessity in this world. As to why it\u2019s required, he doesn\u2019t know. But one thing\u2019s clear \u2013 the civilized world doesn\u2019t want things like Alice to escape and run amok.I wonder what\u2019s so terrible about Alice that they have to go through such lengths. She\u2019s most certainly a cursed doll, but what is so dangerous about her? If anything, she\u2019s a total coward.Frankly, Duncan was quite disappointed by not getting more from this discussion.He thought he had finally found a channel to help him understand the world, but he did not expect the lady lying in the coffin to be as confused as he was.But when his gaze swept over Alice again, who was still sitting quietly on the wooden box, the disappointment faded a little.At least, he now had one more person to converse with on the Vanished\u2014though she seemed to be a doll and would occasionally drop her head off in a horrified manner, plus she has more secrets than even she herself knows. Still, it\u2019s leagues ahead of conversing with the annoying goat head sitting on the mapping table.And speaking of spooky dangers\u2026 which part of the Boundless Sea and Vanished hinted at safety?Even from the perspective of others, his own identity of \u201cCaptain Duncan\u201d seemed more dangerous than the average spooks.Duncan exhaled and unconsciously soothed his stern expression to a more homely one: \u201cI want to know what you will do if I throw you off the ship again.\u201dAlice blinked, \u201cAre you still going to stuff cannonballs into my box again?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cWhat about the nails?\u201d\u201cErm\u2026 No.\u201d\u201cThen what about lead?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026 oomph, I mean, if I refuse you permission to stay aboard\u2026\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019ll row back on my own,\u201d Alice said as she sat demurely with a calm face, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be swallowed up by the sea, and there\u2019s at least a place to stand on with this ship.\u201dDuncan was so shocked by the doll\u2019s frankness that he didn\u2019t know whether to say she was honest or thick-skinned. After much deliberation, he came up with a reply: \u201cYou can be a little vaguer next time\u2026\u201d\u201cYou already know the answer anyway, don\u2019t you?\u201d Alice smiled and said, \u201cBut if I do come back, I might instead find a way to hide somewhere in the cabins from you, and I won\u2019t run to the deck foolishly. I\u2019ve been awake for a bit of time now so I\u2019ve got experience\u2026\u201dDuncan interrupted her: \u201cMy senses span across the ship, right down to the waves hitting its hull. I can tell where you are at any moment.\u201dAlice\u2019s words were suddenly stumped: \u201cUhhh\u2026\u201dDuncan continued with a calm face, \u201cAnd I can also choose to destroy you directly and use a more thorough way to avoid you from continuing to pester my Vanished and me.\u201dMiss Doll here didn\u2019t seem to have thought about this possibility and started to widen her eyes until her neck made a snapping noise\u2026.The headless doll frantically caught her head in mid-drop, then with an irritable face, Alice popped it back on before Duncan continued.\u201cHowever, I suddenly find it\u2019s not bad to have an extra crew member on this ship. I can arrange a place for you here.\u201d\u201cYou should\u2019ve said so earlier! I was so scared that my head popped off again!\u201dDuncan finally couldn\u2019t stop the twitching: \u201cSo what the hell is going on with your neck?\u201dAlice made an innocent face: \u201cI don\u2019t know! I usually don\u2019t have so many opportunities to \u2018come out and move about.\u2019 I didn\u2019t know my body had such problems\u2026\u201dDuncan stared at Alice for several silent seconds before confirming there was no falsehood in her words: \u201cIt seems lying down in a bed for so long isn\u2019t good for your spine and neck.\u201dAlice: \u201c\u2026\u201dDuncan\u2019s mood suddenly improved at seeing his ability to leave the doll speechless.\u201cWell, all in all, we now have a new crewmember on the Vanished. Come with me, I\u2019ll give arrange a resting quarter for you.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As a sail-powered vessel, its size seemed to exceed the necessary limits of its purpose.Nevertheless, such a large size did mean larger warehouses, more cannons, stronger structures, and a more stable posture in the face of wind and waves \u2014 all of which meant it was enough to face the most arduous challenges in a long voyage.But at the moment, Duncan had no plans for the so-called voyage, and the surprisingly large ghost ship brought him only a sense of loneliness. All of which wouldn\u2019t be so bad if there\u2019s an extra crewmate to talk to.Anyways, there are plenty of idle \u201cguest rooms\u201d for the doll to use as a result.Footsteps broke the silence in the eerie corridor, and Duncan took the gothic doll down the wooden staircase to the lower cabin of the aft deck, which was located directly below the captain\u2019s room. From the structural point of view, this should be regarded as the \u201cupper living area\u201d in this big ship, which was more or less bright and tidy than the dark and spooky areas of the lower deck.Eventually, Duncan stopped in front of a crew cabin and casually pushed open the lightly closed wooden door.There are several single cabins like this on board with simple furnishings, but they have been idle for so long that it\u2019s hard to find any sign of people ever using them.These were some of the first things Duncan discovered from his initial exploration of the upper area of the Vanished. He did not think much about it at the time, but now that he was personally in charge of the ghost ship and knew the secret of the ship\u2019s ability to sail alone, a question arose: Since this ship did not need a crew at all\u2026 then who are these crew cabins on the ship for?The single rooms in the upper cabins are obviously reserved for the higher ranked seafarers such as the first mate, the second mate, and lead deckhand, while in the lower areas there are bunk cabins for the general crew. In addition to the ship\u2019s obvious multi-person dining quarter and recreation room, the existence of these facilities in itself were meant for \u201cpeople\u201d.Duncan frowned slightly, realizing that this ghost ship must have some history prior to sailing the sea alone. At the very least, it did have a crew once upon a time.So what happened in the past to make the ship what it is today? Where did the original crew of the ship go? Is the real \u201cCaptain Duncan\u201d the owner of the ship from the start? What does that weird goat head know?\u201cCaptain?\u201d A questioning voice suddenly came from behind and interrupted his thoughts.Duncan had forgotten for a moment that Alice was still there due to adapting to the solitude of being alone for so long.\u201cMy name is Duncan. You can call me Captain Duncan\u2014of course, it\u2019s your freedom to address me as Captain.\u201d Duncan quickly straightened his expression before turning to meet the lady\u2019s gaze, \u201cThis empty room will be yours from now on, go inside and have a look.\u201d\u201cAh, okay!\u201d Alice nodded. First poking her head over Duncan\u2019s shoulder to see what was in the room, then turning around to grab her box floating behind herself, she finally strode inside on her own.Seeing Alice\u2019s \u201ccoffin\u201d that has always been inseparable from the doll, Duncan couldn\u2019t resist the urge to comment: \u201cDo you always carry that box around with you at all times?\u201d\u201cYeah,\u201d said Alice in a matter of course, \u201cwhere else would I put it?\u201d\u201cBut this box was your seal. I thought you would be more wary of it.\u201d Duncan frowned, \u201cNow it seems you can\u2019t do without it.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the people who sealed me so it\u2019s not the box\u2019s fault.,\u201d Alice said as she sat down on her coffin and patted the lid. \u201cAre you going to come in and take a seat?\u201dDuncan shook his head, \u201cNo, how do you feel about this room?\u201d\u201cAh, it\u2019s very good,\u201d Alice looked pleased as she scanned the simple furnishings as if they were some splendid d\u00e9cors. \u201cIs that a wardrobe? I don\u2019t have any clothes to replace and shouldn\u2019t be able to use it\u2026 But it\u2019s nice to have a cupboard. Oh, and there\u2019s a table on which I can put stuff on in the future, but I don\u2019t seem to have anything to put\u2026 Maybe I can use it for my head when I need to comb my hair. It\u2019s more convenient being able to reach all the angles\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s good that you\u2019re satisfied.\u201d It was strange to watch a gothic doll planning her future life plans in this manner, \u201cYou can rest for a while and adapt to the environment. I\u2019m heading back upstairs first. Also, do not go downstairs to the lower deck. You can move freely on this floor and above. Look for me in my captain\u2019s quarter if you need something. If I\u2019m not there, talk to the goat head on the mapping table. He\u2019s my first mate.\u201dAlice nodded as she listened, but when she heard the last two sentences, her eyes widened suddenly: \u201cGoat head?! That pitch-black wooden carving?!\u201d\u201cLooks like you\u2019ve noticed it.\u201d\u201cI noticed\u2026 But you say it can talk?! And is your first mate?\u201d Alice looked amazed, \u201cI thought it was just\u2026 It\u2019s incredible!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 You\u2019re a doll who can talk and move,\u201d Duncan expressionlessly stated as he eyed the doll, \u201cand you still think a talking goat head is incredible?\u201dAlice appeared taken aback by that comment. Looking down at her own hands, she mutters as if she just realized this fact: \u201cAh, now that you mention it\u2026.\u201dDuncan shook his head and turned away: \u201cThat\u2019s about it. You take your time here, and if you need something, come look for me.\u201d\u201cOkay, Captain.\u201dAfter leaving, Duncan did not go anywhere else, but straight to his captain\u2019s room and sat down in front of the mapping table.The goat head: \u201cAh! It\u2019s the captain! It looks like you\u2019ve settled the lady in nicely. You see, like I said, a gentle and harmless lady who doesn\u2019t do any harm to your journey and can chat with you to relieve boredom. I see you\u2019ve decided to leave her aboard. Are you going to arrange something for her to do? The Vanished doesn\u2019t need much people. The deck will clean itself and scrub the cannon. The water tank also maintains itself\u2026. Perhaps she can manage the kitchen? You seem to have been less than happy with the food on board\u2026 Ah, speaking of food, it seems that we need to add some ingredients first. The jerky and hard cheese in the warehouse may be a little old. Although a rough seafarer would not be picky about the food at sea, the great Captain Duncan must\u2026\u201dDuncan felt his brain juices boiling, and he was once again convinced of one thing: he really needed a \u201cnormal conversation partner\u201d like Alice with this noisy goat head around!\u201cShut up,\u201d he glared at the goat head, and only after the latter had closed its mouth did he continue, \u201cyou were acting very honest when Alice was around. To think I had believed you were finally able to stay quiet.\u201d\u201cOne mustn\u2019t interject when the captain is interviewing a new crew member. This is the rule of the sea. Even if I am your loyal first and second mate and lead deckhand\u2026.\u201dDuncan didn\u2019t wait for the goat head to finish (in fact, if he didn\u2019t interrupt, the goat head would never finish): \u201cPay attention to the movement of the doll during the next couple of days.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Yes? You want me to keep an eye on the lady? Are you still not at ease with her? I understand. Taking precautions is a necessary trait for a good captain\u2026.\u201d\u201cShe has a lot of secrets that haven\u2019t been revealed yet. Maybe it\u2019s because she didn\u2019t know it herself yet, or perhaps\u2026 she deliberately concealed it from me. Anyways, she\u2019s a cursed doll with a code name \u2018Anomaly 099\u2019, that much is certain.\u201d Duncan said lightly, \u201cThose people from the other ship did everything they could to stop Alice from roaming freely. Now that she\u2019s a part of the crew, I need a little time to confirm her harmlessness. Even if it\u2019s only to the Vanished.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But even so, out of caution, he ordered the goat head to keep an eye on the \u201ccursed doll\u201d at all times.He\u2019s had enough self-awareness to know he\u2019s not an expert in the field of occultism, and a walking, talking doll was beyond his knowledge. Alice\u2019s actions thus far may be harmless, but if the doll lady had some sort of invisible \u201ceffect\u201d on her surroundings? Duncan most likely wouldn\u2019t be able to see that, making the goat head more professional in this regard.And even after that, Duncan knew he couldn\u2019t keep tabs on everything at all times, now could he? Although he\u2019s decided to survive on this \u201cside,\u201d he might still have to return to the world \u201copposite\u201d of the door when the situation becomes necessary.Thinking of this point, Duncan\u2019s eyes slightly narrowed as he glanced at the edge of the mapping table where the goat head sat. Those obsidian-carved eyeballs showed nothing but an empty void when meeting his.When I return \u201cacross the door,\u201d back to my single unit apartment\u2026 Is this goat head aware of it? What happens on the Vanished when I\u2019m not around?This sudden question made Duncan get a little irritated, but under the empty gaze of the goat head, he did dare to show anything to give himself away. Instead, he mentally focused in on Alice\u2019s room with his mind to see what she\u2019s doing.Of course, he didn\u2019t have a voyeuristic fetish\u2014even if the other person was an \u201cinhuman being,\u201d it doesn\u2019t make it right. Plus, he didn\u2019t actually have the ability to see what she\u2019s doing, but rather a vague inkling sensation returning from the ship if she\u2019s moving or doing anything to destroy the Banished.After all, beneath the harmless, elegant and beautiful appearance was in essence, a cursed doll, a dangerous individual called \u201cAnomaly 099\u201d by ordinary folks of this world.From what he found, Alice was still in the room, probably studying the furnishings and setting up a place to rest.This brought a wave of relief to Duncan, which got interrupted again by the goat head\u2019s voice: \u201cCaptain, what are your next arrangements? If you\u2019re bored, your loyal\u2026\u201d\u201cShut up.\u201d Duncan shot a glare at the goat head before pressing his hands around the edge of the table. With his mind, he brings up the image of him holding the steering wheel above and allows the ghostly green flame to materialize.In a blaze of flame, Duncan\u2019s body was transformed into a spirit body again, and the overflowing fire spread along the table until it enveloped the entire room and up into the upper deck, eventually covering the masts and forming a sailing blanket.As a large number of small and large sails flexibly adjusted their angles against the sea breeze, the huge three-masted sailing ship began to accelerate slowly on the vast open sea.Duncan was pleased with what he\u2019s done\u2014then shifted his gaze down at the map chart in front of himself, which remained filled with grayish-white fog coiling around the sheet. However, the silhouette representing the Vanished was clearly moving and pushing the murkiness away.After a brief thought, he began to try to concentrate his attention on the mapping chart. Then, using the green flame as an extension of himself, he promptly formed a \u201cconnection\u201d with this map and understood something \u2013 this chart was an extraordinary item in and of itself with more features than he imagined.As a test, he willed the image on the parchment to magnify around the Vanished and vice-versa. This proved it was more like a visual radar screen than a mere map. The only con was that it only showed areas explored by the Vanished beforehand while everything else continued to be a murky white.Keeping up his fa\u00e7ade of indifference despite the glee he held, Duncan expanded the green flame as far as he could manage. From there, his consciousness nearly became one with the ship, sensing every segment of the hull and deck.Maybe\u2026\u2026 this the power of the \u201ccaptain\u201d?Duncan pondered what else he could do with this power.First of all, I must master this green flame if I want to survive out here.As for the \u201cnext arrangement\u201d the goat head just mentioned\u2026It became obvious to Duncan what he needed to do next after glancing down at the chart.Since I don\u2019t know enough about the world, I must open up this map by doing some exploration.He didn\u2019t need to worry about being robbed anyways since the image of \u201cCaptain Duncan\u201d was obviously some sort of world boss character in this world. He would be lucky if a ship willingly came near him instead of him chasing the other party.Retracting the flames back into his body, Duncan stood up from the mapping table and did his first experiment. He was no longer in his ghostly form, but the translucent ghostly green sails of flame did not disappear like he willed it. It appears he could pick and choose which part turns into spirit form. As for the power source for the green flames out there, it\u2019s also not from him, but from the Vanished itself, effectively confirming he and the ship are separate entities.Duncan left the mapping table and focused on the door leading to his personal apartment in the other world. He needed a quieter environment to study his newfound powers. But before that happens, he needs someone to oversee the ship\u2019s continued voyage while it maps the region.Shifting his gaze down to the goat head: \u201cYou take the helm.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d the wooded figurine appeared stunned for a split second, \u201cBut Captain, you\u2026\u201d\u201cI have something to do, don\u2019t bother me during this time.\u201d Duncan didn\u2019t seem to care what the goat head would say and commanded.From what he found, the entire Vanished was connected to the captain\u2019s quarter like veins to a heart \u2013 including the goat head. So, that means the goat head could also tell what\u2019s happening on the ship like he did. In fact, Duncan suspected the wooded figurine was some sort of \u201ccontrol system\u201d for this ghost ship. Imagine a computer on a modern ship with an AI autopilot function in case of emergencies.Duncan was not the builder of the ship so naturally he didn\u2019t know how the ship worked. But this was the best guess he could make at this time. On the other hand, the goat head did always claim to be the first/second mate and lead deckhand. If he couldn\u2019t provide this much assistance, then what use was he anyways? Duncan might as well toss the annoying thing away and promote Alice to the position instead.A minute later, the goat head finally responded with an annoyingly cheery voice: \u201cUhh, alright Captain. You can rest assured that your loyal\u2026.\u201dDuncan ignored his words and waved him off. Turning for the door back to his apartment, he casually stepped through the murky fog and closed the door behind himself, thus ending his venture for the day.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Nevertheless, Duncan could still sense the Vanished in the back of his head \u2013 like the moving rudders, the adjusting sails, and the stable movement of the vessel on the water.As he expected, the goat head had temporarily taken control and began to carry out his duties as the first mate.But of course, the flexibility and speed of the Vanished couldn\u2019t be compared to when Duncan headed the helm. Even so, his primary purpose was to further dispel the fog from the mapping chart. It may be slower, but that\u2019s of no consequence.After confirming that nothing terrible was happening with the goat head and goth doll, Duncan finally breathed a sigh of relief and glanced around this familiar captain\u2019s room.This was his private resting quarter on the ship and the most lavish of all the rooms. In addition to a soft, comfy bed, there\u2019s also a large classical wardrobe and shelf against the wall opposite of the door. Sadly, there were no books on those shelves, only a few pens, and tools for writing on the main desk near the window \u2013 this area also had several hooks, which was where Duncan found the gun and pirate saber before.Coming up to the writing desk, he placed the weapons down and opened the drawer where a box of gunpowder and pellets were stored.Here, there\u2019s also a small brass compass he kept stored among other things. Like usual, the needle behind the glass spun wildly as if pulled by some chaotic force field once he picked it up. Aside from this feature, there\u2019s also a set of text inscribed at the bottom metallic casing: \u201cWe are all lost souls.\u201dTaking a seat as he played with the compass, Duncan began to review the new pieces of information he had gathered today. This silence continued until he casually ignited a wick of green flame at his fingertip. Gradually, the hand closest to the glow transformed and turned ghostly like he intended, confirming his theory that he could change only parts of himself at will.Then another idea hit him. If he could extend the flame across the Vanished, then what about other items that aren\u2019t entirely connected to the vessel? Grabbing one of those old ink pens from the table with his free hand, he slowly dipped the metal tip into the greenish flame. Instead of bursting into flame as one would expect, only a little shade of green spread across the surface and gave the Victorian-era pen an eerie glow.Unlike when he manifested the flames across the sails and rudder, Duncan did not get any feedback from this experiment.Silently writing this finding down in his mind, Duncan concluded the green flame doesn\u2019t burn like traditional fire, nor does it have any temperature or feedback on ordinary objects. That brings up another question about what would happen if he tried burning items from outside the Vanished. Will the flames react?Duncan pondered the idea for a moment, then came up with the image of the goth puppet doll. Technically, she\u2019s not of the Vanished.Will she be affected by this ghost fire?But he quickly tossed the idea of burning the doll out the window. No matter if Alice was a cursed doll or a human, she\u2019s still an independent individual with consciousness and will. Doing something so inhumane was out of Duncan\u2019s ethical standard.Duncan then tested this discovery a few more times to determine if the other items in the room had supernatural properties until he remembered the brass compass was still in his possession.The item lay quietly on the table, and the needle under the glass shell spun wildly as usual. However, perhaps it\u2019s his own illusion, but Duncan saw the pointer freeze for a split second when he shot his \u201cmalicious\u201d gaze at the item.Duncan: \u201c\u2026..\u201dThis thing just reacted to my gaze!Originally, he was a little afraid of the compass; after all, it had the handwriting left by the \u201creal Captain Duncan,\u201d and he was worried about whether the dead ghost captain had left some kind of power or \u201ctrap\u201d behind to prevent thieves from stealing it. But now, after seeing a reaction from his gaze, he\u2019s made up his mind regardless of the risk involvedReaching out to grab that cold metallic case, Duncan directly placed his finger with the candlewick of green flame floating at the tip of it. Immediately, the compass ignited into a burst of ghostly fire with countless phantoms flickering inside that glow. Then it stopped. The constant rotating needle now points to a particular direction on the vast open sea.Duncan\u2019s heart thumped with excitement. At this moment, he could clearly sense the \u201cfeedback\u201d from the compass, thus confirming it was an \u201cabnormal item\u201d that his ghost fire could dominate. But before he could examine the details from this connection, a sudden and intense \u201cforce\u201d abruptly swept over him!He only felt his body shake for a moment; the next, it was a total blur. The furniture in the room had turned into nothingness, and even the surrounding walls and roofs disintegrated like snowflakes on a short winter day. Now, only endless darkness remains.Duncan stood in the middle of this hollow black void in amazement. With his heart ringing, his first reaction was to reach for the musket gun and sword placed next to himself. But to his shock and horror, his weapons were gone; instead, he only found the brass compass still clutching in his hands.Blinking in confusion and daze, countless wisps of thin light threads suddenly filled the area around the compass and intertwined with the surrounding darkness. Before he knew it, dots of starry lights began to emerge, scattering sporadically across the whole landscape like the milky way in space.It\u2019s truly a magnificent scene to witness because the only way to describe it was\u2026. a galaxy\u2019s birth.Right now, there were a lot of emotions swelling out of Duncan\u2019s heart: wariness, unease, but there was never a sense of crisis about any of this\u2026. in fact, he found peace here, a long-lost sensation since being trapped in this weird predicament.The next second, Duncan\u2019s gaze involuntarily looked upwards towards a cluster of stars. His impression was that it was unstable and about to fade into the darkness completely.Duncan didn\u2019t know why nor what compelled him to do this, but he wanted to reach out with his hands and grasp that star.Then a huge pull ripped at him the next. Duncan\u2019s entire figure had started to fly, rushing straight for the source of the stars at such breakneck speed that the webs of light that formed around the compass had been left behind, and the star river was no longer visible after becoming a spinning blur in his view.In the rapid flight, he subconsciously wanted to grasp harder against the compass \u2013 which was the cause of all this \u2013 only to discover it\u2019s gone by now. But before crashing into that fading star with no way out, an afterglow from the corner of his eyes suddenly caught Duncan\u2019s attention.It was a shadow that emerged near him. It didn\u2019t seem unnatural; in fact, it was so natural it didn\u2019t even occur to him that it could be anything otherwise. Then he finally got a better picture of that contour. It looked like a bird that was flying with its wings stretched out. Then before he could get any more details, his vision blacked out\u2026.When Duncan finally regained a part of his consciousness, he was back in reality on the floor, cold and heavy from whatever supernatural high he had just gone through.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He felt his soul had been divided into two parts, one part remaining on the Vanished, and the other stuffed into an utterly unfamiliar shell, which was as difficult to control as an old and broken tape recorder. The chaotic perceptions were rampaging through the nerves that left his limbs numb and dulled.This uncomfortable sensation lasted for several minutes until it finally faded, allowing Duncan to finally awaken from the long hibernating state and move a little.First opening his eyes, Duncan took in his surroundings.This was a crypt-like space, with burning torches inserted into the stone walls in the distance, and the shaking light of the fire reflected the terrible state around him. Duncan saw many people, or many dead corpses to be exact, thrown together into a mound atop of the mud and rocks. Most are mutilated and ragged with obvious signs of decay from what he saw, which explained the buzzing carrion smell.Eyes aside, his ears also picked up some faint noises: droplets of water dripping down from the top of this cave and the distant sound of sewage water flowing like a river somewhere in these channels. Going by these clues, this cave must be connected to some kind of sewage system.Duncan blinked in confusion and attempted to figure out what\u2019s happening. Ignoring the strange environment, he needed to make sure this was even his body for one. Staring down at his right hand, what he saw were five scrawny unfamiliar fingers. As for the compass he\u2019s been holding before all this, it had disappeared completely.Then glancing around to recall what happened, images of the starry sky and webs of light hit him like a tidal wave. From what he recalled, that shadow at the end should be some kind of bird, but of course, there\u2019s nothing like that next to him now.It looks like that bird didn\u2019t come into reality like I did.Duncan gently tightened his fingers to form a fist as a means to force the unease back down. Once done, he began to fiddle with this new hand of his until a puff of faintly green flame emerged from his fingertip.It must be said that this ghost fire was far weaker than the one Duncan was used to. Nevertheless, it did dispel the fear of losing this new power of his since he had barely managed to learn to use it yet. Also, his connection with the flame was strange. He clearly noticed another part of his soul not being here but rather back on the Vanished sitting at the desk with the brass compass in hand still.It was a peculiar feeling of having split bodies, but Duncan still had a vague awareness of what was going on: a part of his spirit had been projected, or extended, to another mind across unknown distances and burrowed itself in this strange body.This must have something to do with that brass compass! Could this be the power of that \u201citem\u201d?Duncan had some speculations in mind, but he didn\u2019t let the matter take up too much time. After confirming his main body back on the Vanished was fine, he began assessing what\u2019s the deal with this second body.First of all, he\u2019s no longer out at sea anymore, but on land. Actual land that he\u2019s been searching so hard for in the past week.Second, this eerie cave doesn\u2019t look like a safe place, and the bodies scattered around didn\u2019t look like a normal \u201cburial\u201d scene either.The shell I now occupy\u2026 what sort of bad luck did he have to be trapped in such a hell?Inhaling deeply to gather strength so he could sit up, Duncan suddenly noticed something strange with this shell\u2019s bodily function. Looking down at where the strangeness was coming from, he widened his eyes at the sight of a huge gaping hole in the chest where the heart should be!\u201c\u2026\u2026 WTF?!\u201dEven if he\u2019s nonchalant about a lot of things, Duncan still found himself sweating heavily at this discovery. There are goosebumps rising up from his skin until he realizes something even more frightening: how was he still standing around and able to curse?\u201cThis is\u2026 a corpse?\u201dAfter a few moments, Duncan now got a firm understanding of the situation and calmed down.He had no reason to freak out. That was only out of reflex. After all, he\u2019s a ghost captain on a cursed ship with an evil goat head looking gargoyle thingy. If that doesn\u2019t scare him then this much shouldn\u2019t. It\u2019s not the first time he saw someone lose an important body part \u2013 like Alice. She\u2019s often dropping her head.With these chaotic thoughts swirling in his mind, Duncan regained his composure at a speed surprising even to himself. Flexing his arms and legs to adjust to the new body, he began stepping over to the corpses strewn about in the cave.\u201cI knew it\u2026\u201d Duncan found the chests on these corpses were also hollow and missing their hearts.Take the closest body to himself for example. It was a middle-aged man with a gaunt face. Likely a beggar on the streets and has been dead for a while now based on the sunken eye sockets and decaying flesh. Nevertheless, the despair and struggle conveyed in the facial expression told how horrific the experience must\u2019ve been for the victim.Continuing forward, he soon came upon two other bodies that caught his eye. Unlike the others who mostly only had their hearts cut out, these victims had been violently smashed on the head with a stone.This brought some ideas to Duncan\u2019s mind \u2013 perhaps these two had killed themselves off to avoid the pain of having their hearts cut out.To tell the truth, the things in this cave were a little too thrilling for the ordinary folk, and even Duncan felt a little overwhelmed by what he saw.After examining all the corpses, he then found a relatively clean stone in a distant spot to sit down. This gave him time to tidy up and clean out his thought process.Obviously, this spot was the crime scene of a horrific murder case, but judging from the overly cold and uniform way of killing, it must be more than one murderer, but an evil ceremony of some sort like a cult.Duncan summoned the ghost flame again, feeling the connection between himself and the \u201cmain body\u201d back on the ship. He doesn\u2019t know how, but he knew this projected state could be cut off at any time by him. But no, that\u2019s not what he wanted. Even if it\u2019s only to get some information about the land of this world, it\u2019s good enough.After a brief rest and an awkward moment of finding the air coming out of the hole in his heart, Duncan quickly pulled himself up to peer deeper into the darker parts of the cave. He still hasn\u2019t located the source of the chain rattling sound he heard earlier. A sign there are probably still living people moving about. At the very least, prisoners\u2026.Naturally, carelessly rushing over to check the situation was certainly not safe, but Duncan does not care \u2013 he\u2019s got an open heart right now anyways.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although having a lethal hole through the chest didn\u2019t affect Duncan\u2019s ability to \u201csurvive\u201d at all. As a normal human, walking around partially naked was really too creepy. At the very least, he wanted some psychological comfort from not having to hear the wind blowing through his heart\u2026.Also, it\u2019s common sense to speak to a living human without a huge hole in the chest less they want to be taken as undead and beheaded in the next. That\u2019s how all those zombie movies work, right?After treating the \u201cwound\u201d with a quick fix, Duncan carefully left the gloomy and damp cave for the passageway connecting to some form of a sewage system.The tunnel was deep, damp, and dark, but there seemed to be hidden ventilation holes set in place for ventilation, meaning there were workers who would occasionally come down. This somehow made it bearable from the stink.Eventually, he came across his first item of interest \u2013 oil lamps and torches hanging against both sides of the brick wall at measured intervals. Best of all, it\u2019s been used recently, proving this wasn\u2019t some abandoned underground facility.After walking another long distance along the predetermined path, Duncan suddenly found himself at a fork road leading to a lower elevation. On top of this, pipes constantly pass waste into the main river, meaning this should be the converging point for the sewer and the residence home.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe had to take a moment to think about why in heaven would anyone want to commit themselves to such an environment. Not only were the brick walls and sewage water foul to the nose, but it couldn\u2019t be good for one\u2019s health either. However, there was some good news. If people had constructed such a massive sewage system, it must be catering to a large settlement with some technological advancements in society.This was enough to give Duncan the strength to endure this foul attack on his nose. He wants information about this world, and now he\u2019s getting some very key notes about it.Duncan continued to move with increased vigor but was stopped a short distance away when his sight fell upon something built into the wall.It\u2019s a glass lamp, but more than the oil version he saw earlier, this one was built inside a sturdy metal casing and stuffed inside the walls. Also, the light it gave off was noticeably brighter than the previous versions.Duncan leaned in and examined the object. Finally, he deduced the energy source was in fact gas spewing up from the hole inside, making this a gas lamp!But it did differ from what he knew from his own world. The shape was different in terms of style, and the glass was inscribed with several slender rune symbols similar to what Alice\u2019s coffin had. From what he could tell, they weren\u2019t added afterward by a third party but at the factory during production.The runes are a little different, but the air around these are similar. Both sacred and ritualistic.Duncan stepped back and peered further into the sewer tunnel ahead. From here on out, the lights are all gas lamps set in regular intervals instead of the oil and torches. This seemed excessive in his opinion. For an underground facility that hardly gets visited by anyone except for necessary maintenance, why would the workers put this many equipment down here? This couldn\u2019t possibly be cheap to maintain or pay for.This gave Duncan a sense that they\u2019re trying to repel something lurking here or beings that are hostile towards human civilization from the darkness.With that in mind, he trod carefully and continued his exploration until he found something strange again.It\u2019s a deep dark red painting set in-between two lamps here. Due to its location, this part was dimmer than the other areas of the tunnel, but even so, Duncan could make out its image \u2013 it\u2019s a pair of hands reaching upwards in the worship of a spherical orb above.\u201cThe false sun will eventually fall, and the real sun god will be resurrected from blood and fire! The vitality of all things belongs to the sun, and the order of all things belongs to the sun!\u201d Duncan stood quietly and read the inscription at the bottom of the creepy painting.He stayed like this for a long time until a noise suddenly caught his attention again. It\u2019s the sound of footsteps.Next thing he knew, his eyes were met with several figures in burqas coming his way from the front. Their heads were all shrouded behind a hood so Duncan couldn\u2019t see their faces. Nevertheless, he didn\u2019t intend to hide from these suspicious fellas or want to in this cramped tunnel.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, the fact that he didn\u2019t run and stood there with a huge grin obviously came as a shock to those hooded figures.\u201cA sacrifice has escaped!\u201d One of them yelled after a brief delay.\u201cQuick! Stop him! Don\u2019t let him run!\u201d Another shouted and began running over, believing Duncan would flee.\u201cDon\u2019t let him run! A sacrifice has escaped!\u201d They kept repeating this despite the other side not moving an inch.As a result, Duncan\u2019s shrug and honest act of standing in the middle of the tunnel somehow created a weird and awkward atmosphere that didn\u2019t befit the situation. Naturally, this didn\u2019t escape the hooded people who had noticed how wrong this was halfway over. Nevertheless, they didn\u2019t stop running over and quickly circled their target.\u201cShould I have run? The mood is already like this\u2026.\u201d Duncan scratched his nose like he should\u2019ve acted a little to match their enthusiasm.Ignoring the cold joke that could freeze a ghost, two of the black hoods warily eyed the escapee and began murmuring something.\u201cWhy did one manage to escape?\u201d\u201cCould it be that the hounds of the Church discovered this hiding spot\u2026 But this one doesn\u2019t look like he was let out\u2026\u201d\u201cRegardless, let\u2019s take him back first. This sacrifice doesn\u2019t look right\u2026. We need to dispose of him quickly.\u201d\u201cLet the emissary decide.\u201dDuncan was completely confused about the background of this gang, let alone what the \u201cemissary \u201d mentioned by the other party meant. But upon thinking about what he had seen along the way and the word \u201csacrifice,\u201d he could vaguely guess the truth.He didn\u2019t know what kind of reaction he should make to be considered a \u201cnormal sacrifice,\u201d and he had no intention of cooperating with these people\u2019s \u201cperformance.\u201d This was a temporary body so Duncan naturally had very little to worry about.\u201cWhere are you taking me?\u201d he asks after a little observation.Those in the hoods were obviously surprised to hear the calm opening of the \u201csacrifice.\u201d Although they each wore a black mask that completely covered their faces, Duncan could still guess the surprise they felt over his question.\u201cYou are not qualified to ask us questions. Take him away!\u201d One of the hooded men viciously snaps.A few of the black-robed immediately stepped forward and wanted to apprehend the guy. However, Duncan beat them to the punch by taking the initiative: \u201cNo need, I\u2019ll follow you.\u201dThe black hoods all exchanged looks between themselves \u2013 probably feeling the \u201csacrifice\u201d in front of them was behaving too abnormal and calm. Nevertheless, the leading black robe waved a hand to signal their silence: \u201cThat\u2019s for the best. You can\u2019t run away anyways\u2026 Come with us and you might even be given glory and dignity.\u201dSeveral of the gang gathered around Duncan to seal off any chance of escape, leading him back and forth through the deeper channels of the sewer system.The foul smell of the wastewater was disgusting the deeper they went, but these hooded people didn\u2019t seem to take notice at all over the dirty and moldy walls. If Duncan wasn\u2019t already a dead person in this shell, he might\u2019ve freaked out already when he stepped on something slimy and goopy.\u201cThis is the City-State of Pland?\u201d Duncan eventually asks this like he\u2019s part of their group.\u201cThat\u2019s obvious \u2026\u201d One of the black-robed replied subconsciously, but then reacted and stared at Duncan like he\u2019s seeing a ghost, \u201cYou\u2019re very calm, boy. Do you know what\u2019s going to happen next?\u201d\u201cI can take a probable guess.\u201d Duncan nodded with a big smile, \u201cThe true sun god\u2026 right?\u201dSeveral of the black-robed halted at that moment, seemingly baffled by how casual the sacrifice mentioned their Lord.\u201cWait, is he a believer of the Lord too?\u201d\u201cNo way, he\u2019s obviously an escaped sacrifice\u2026\u201d the other black-robed whispered back, then glanced at Duncan, \u201cyou\u2019re quite clever, but don\u2019t think that this will save you from being a sacrifice\u2026 The Lord has decided your destiny, and you had better embrace it.\u201dDuncan did not argue. He knows they\u2019re reacting this way due to his unexpected calm attitude. Perhaps they\u2019re thinking he\u2019s pretending as a way to wiggle his way out of being a sacrifice. Regardless, Duncan didn\u2019t care what they thought because it\u2019s not like he could move the facial muscles anyway. Necrosis had set in on this shell, so it\u2019s a given he behaves this way!\u201cSo you think the current \u2018sun\u2019 in the sky is a false sun? That it will one day fall out of the sky sooner or later?\u201d Duncan begins his mission of gathering intelligence.\u201cOf course the false sun will fall!\u201d This topic was obviously a provoking subject for these cultists so they were feverish in their reply. \u201cEven the lackeys of the Church have to admit in the historical chronicles that the sun in the sky is a twisted and grotesque object that only appeared after the Great Calamity. What truly brings life and order to all things in this world is the Sun God, but that vile\u2026. vile forgery has usurped our Lord! Sooner or later, that vile artifact will fall out of the sky!\u201dImmediately afterward, Duncan heard the surrounding cultists also join in support of their leader, \u201cSooner or later the false sun will fall, and the real Sun God will be revived through blood and fire! The excess seawater of the world will be banished back into the void by the might of our Lord, and the earth will return to the era of great fertility and stability!\u201dListening to the chant of these cultists, Duncan\u2019s mind began racing with his thoughts. He knew this kind of fanatical cultist could not be reasoned with, meaning the information he\u2019s receiving was likely distorted and tampered with misinformation. Nevertheless, there are certain details he could use and assume true.The \u201csun\u201d hanging in the sky is a fake\u2026 and the real sun has been usurped\u2026.They firmly believe that the real sun is a fallen deity, and that god will \u201crecover from blood and fire\u201d\u2026They also mentioned the excess sea water in the world will recede, that the era of abundance and stability will return\u2026 What exactly do they mean by that?It didn\u2019t take long for the cultists to regain their composure from reciting their religious mantra. After all, they still had a sacrifice to escort.\u201cHave you noticed this \u2018sacrifice\u2019 is a bit creepy?\u201d One of the cultists asks the leader.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem quite right\u2026 I\u2019m a little unsure.\u201d\u201cCould it be that this sacrifice had been in the lightless underground for too long when he escaped before, and now his head is possessed by something\u2026\u201d\u201cThen that\u2019s perfect, the Lord\u2019s power will purify him.\u201dDuncan didn\u2019t miss their whispering conversation, especially the part about the \u201clightless underground.\u201d But just when he wanted to gather more information from them, the black-robed man at the head of the group stopped.\u201cHere we are.\u201d The black-robed cultist said in a low, cold voice.Duncan regretted he didn\u2019t chase the topic faster, but the scene that came into view attracted him more.Ahead was the nexus of the sewer system, a convergence that led into a spacious underground hall, and there were a lot of black-robed cultists here!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He didn\u2019t have the same hooded setup as the rest though, but a golden mask that radiated endless flames in a hellish manner. Then behind the masked man was another object of note \u2013 a high metallic totem burning with a fireball at the top.\u201cWe caught an escaped sacrifice!\u201d One of the black-robed who had been charged with escorting Duncan stepped forward and reported to the \u201cleader\u201d with a tone of praise. \u201cThis sacrifice stayed inside the darkness for too long, so his mind is slightly confused right now. May the greatness of the Lord bestow salvation to this sad fleshly body of his!\u201dThe cult leader wearing the golden mask on stage eyed Duncan with an unreadable face before speaking with a hint of surprise: \u201cThe sacrifice escaped?\u201dDuncan didn\u2019t react at all to being the attention of all, only observing his captors with curiosity and the strange stake totem in the rear.Perhaps, these symbols are strange and bizarre for the ordinary folk in this world, but he only needed a glance to tell they\u2019re imitating the sun in the sky. To be clear, it\u2019s not the strange \u201cball of light\u201d currently hanging in the sky but the real sun according to Duncan\u2019s memory from his world.Towards the necrosis face of Duncan\u2019s shell, the cult priest in question didn\u2019t find it odd that the sacrifice didn\u2019t panic and scream. Those who get lost in the darkness tended to appear to lose their minds like a lost soul that has been sucked out of intelligence.\u201cGo and check the place where the sacrifices are being held.\u201d The priest eventually turned to a believer closest to him and ordered.After the command, he went ahead and gave the \u201cescort\u201d a nod and started praising him: \u201cWell done, you have earned great merit for our Lord. May eternal glory shine upon you when the world is illuminated with its light!\u201dIt was just a painless and unobtrusive compliment, but it was enough to encourage the rest of the black robes in the hall to begin chanting glory to their sun god. While they did so, some also pushed Duncan onto the center stage where the masked priest stood.\u201cPoor soul who has gone astray\u2026 can you feel the deep, cold darkness between the crevices of this world?\u201dDuncan couldn\u2019t understand what the superstitious stick was saying, so he merely kept his silence and watched. Apparently, this worked because the priest didn\u2019t lash out at him and spoke more feverishly:\u201cCold and darkness are the sufferings left by the false sun to this world. Under the rule of the false sun, the dark oceans ravaged everything, leaving only fragmented small pieces of land for the living to spawn and struggle. But the world is cruel, hiding the shadows of the old era in the underground darkness, awaiting to strike when the chance arises. At this rate, all of humanity will be contaminated by evil\u2026.\u201d\u201cHow do we endure this long-suffering? How do we endure the distorted and absurd world brought about by the false sun?\u201d\u201cWe can\u2019t, that\u2019s how! We only wish for our Lord to return. May the true sun god descend upon our earth again. May he burn away the darkness with blood and fire! May he bring order and prosperity back to our world!\u201dInstigated by the masked priest\u2019s very encouraging tone, Duncan could clearly feel the atmosphere in the assembly hall change. First in agreement, then the echoing fervent cries: \u201cMay the real sun god come to the earth again! He shall rise from blood and fire! He shall cleanse our world\u2019s darkness with his light!\u201d\u201cMay the true sun god descend to the earth again,\u201d said the priest on the stage. Then extending a hand to Duncan, \u201cAnd today, our Lord will further awaken from his slumber. The blood of the lost soul will soothe his wounds and bring us one step closer to the false sun\u2019s collapse!\u201d\u201cBring forward the offerings!\u201dSeveral black-robed men rushed over to push Duncan up there; however, the latter had taken the liberty of climbing up to the stage on his own. Although this body was not very good, it\u2019s still possible to bend those legs and arms for a quick climb.Once up there, he came eye to eye with the masked priest, who was still maintaining the air of mystique. Nevertheless, the odd behavior from the sacrifice still caught the priest by surprise, leaving the whole hall eerily quiet.Duncan didn\u2019t seem to notice the change in the atmosphere around him at all though. He had just gathered some useful information about this world and was looking forward to seeing more rare scenes before this body was \u201cscrapped\u201d.\u201cSo?\u201d Duncan rubbed his hands with a certain sense of curiosity, \u201cWhat now?\u201dMasked Priest: \u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYou not hear me?\u201d Duncan frowned awkwardly due to the tense muscles on his face, \u201cI said, what\u2019s next?\u201dAt this time, the priest finally came back to his senses. Although separated by a mask, there was obviously a moment of confusion in those eyes. In a low voice: \u201cThe shadow in the darkness has indeed affected your mind, but rest assured, the supreme and holy sun will end your suffering\u2026 Bring the sacrifice to the totem!\u201dTwo black-robes immediately stepped up from the side and apprehended the sacrifice by the arms, pulling him over to the totem with the burning fireball at the top.Although Duncan did not show any resistant gestures with his body, but the captors still used a lot of strength to clamp down to the point Duncan could feel the bones on his shoulders were starting to dislocate from the pressure. However, his attention was immediately drawn to the priest again when the guy came over.The masked priest had drawn a strangely shaped dagger out that looked like a twisted dead branch. It glistened with a black light, similar to the obsidian material used for the goat head\u2019s eyes back on the Vanished.Duncan knew it should be about time as the chants begun to ring out, which he readied himself to cut off the \u201csoul projected\u201d state he was in.\u201cOh sun god of the highest and most holy! Please accept the sacrifice on this altar! I offer you the heart of this sacrifice, and may you return to our world through blood and fire!\u201dDuncan immediately stopped himself and stared at the priest with eyes of watching a fool.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In his view, that dagger was most likely some sort of \u201csupernatural\u201d item as well, and perhaps this priest was also a \u201cspecial human\u201d capable of harnessing said extraordinary powers like himself. Now that brought forward a new question \u2013 what sort of role do people like that play in a civilized society?As the blade struck down and stabbed into his chest, Duncan didn\u2019t flinch nor scream, only hearing a muffled noise of the rags being flayed by the metal. Thankfully, nothing burned inside of him\u2026.But not everything was fine and dandy at this moment. In the rear, where the totem stood, the flaming fireball had started to make a disturbing crackling sound like you would expect from a firework being doused with oil. The next thing Duncan knew, he had felt a \u201ctouch\u201d reaching out at himself from the totem. It\u2019s filled with chilling madness, which he understood as a supernatural phenomenon no doubt.The unexpected change in the \u201csymbolic sun\u201d immediately attracted the attention of the nearest believers, accompanied by several suppressed exclamations until the noise died down from the frenzy. Clearly this outcome was not normal for the ritual because the two black hoods holding Duncan down had let go and got to their knees in fear. As for the masked priest, he was making a look of confusion with those eyes at the supposed sacrifice.Knowing the jig was up, Duncan rigidly formed a faint smile with those lips and touched the dagger that\u2019s currently stabbed into his chest. Next thing everyone knew, a wisp of ghostly green flame had popped into existence and wrapped around the blade.Almost instantly, Duncan got the \u201cfeedback\u201d from the knife as he wanted, but in this case, it was weak and hollow like some sort of cheap counterfeit. Whatever power that\u2019s inside the blade wasn\u2019t of its own, but borrowed from something greater.But for Duncan, this discovery was enough.With a grin, he unhurriedly spoke in a frank manner: \u201cI have two things to say.\u201dIn the next instant, the priest felt the connection between himself and the obsidian knife being sidetracked by an external force until it was completely cut off.\u201cFirst, I\u2019m a man with a big heart \u2014you see, this big.\u201dAlready torn to begin with, but now even more ragged due to the dagger, Duncan stripped himself of the fabric hiding the gaping hollow hole in his chest. Through this grand reveal, the priest presiding over the sacrifice ceremony was clearly shocked and taken aback.\u201cSecond, try to avoid offering expired food to your Lord.\u201dWith a gentle shove, Duncan forces the priest back with ease using this stiff shell of his. He didn\u2019t know why, but after wrapping the ghostly green flame around the dagger, the original owner appeared somehow weaker\u2026.As if coming back from his shock, the priest first flew into a panic, followed by a great deal of anger that caused his whole body to tremble. Pointing an accusing finger at the sacrifice, the masked priest roared: \u201cThis filth has come back from the dead! He\u2019s an undead! How dare a vile creature like you desecrate a holy ritual like this! Vile filth, which daring necromancer is responsible for this treacherous act!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Duncan said casually as he glanced down at the obsidian knife. Once he got another faint feedback from the blade, a whimsical idea suddenly formed in his brain, \u201cBut I suddenly got a great idea to satisfy my curiosity.\u201dAfter saying this, he suddenly raised the obsidian knife and pointed it at the masked priest. Raising that voice to a booming level so all of the black hoods could hear himself:\u201cO sun god of the highest and most holy! Please accept the sacrifice on this stage! I offer you the heart thy heart, and may you return from blood and fire!\u201dThe next second, he saw the flames on the obsidian knife grow several folds, followed by the same cold maddening touch seeping out from the totem. Unlike the first round though, the target was instead the masked priest, which obviously knew what\u2019s going to happen next as he attempted to flee from the stage.However, the burning black knife of red and green flame flew straight out of Duncan\u2019s hand on its own and stabbed directly into the target\u2019s heart. With the latter issuing out a terrible scream, the cult leader\u2019s chest was directly pierced, and his heart was reduced to ash at that instant.Without effort, the blade promptly returned to Duncan\u2019s hand in the next, finally exhausting the last ounce of its remaining power.This ritual expected two individuals on this altar, one of whom must give up their heart as a sacrifice. Since he didn\u2019t have one to begin with on this shell, Duncan knew there could be only one other target \u2013 the priest himself who actually had a heart. But never in his wildest dream did he expect things to work out so smoothly.Shooting a look towards the totem in the rear, Duncan slightly narrowed his eyes on the object and muttered his thoughts: \u201cPerhaps, it doesn\u2019t matter who is holding the dagger so long as the words are right\u2026. You will take them anyways, right?\u201dOf course, the fireball on the totem wouldn\u2019t answer his question, but the cultists around the altar had obviously reacted by flying into a huge panic. Many were screaming, but more were outraged at what just transpired that it overshadowed the fear brought on by the death of their leader!Several cultists closest to the altar moved first, shouting the name of the sun god and rushing at Duncan with their weapons drawn.This ruined the plan Duncan had in mind. He intended to try another chant by saying, \u201cI offer the hearts of everyone on the altar to the sun god,\u201d but when he saw that some of the cultists had brought out revolvers to shoot him, the idea was squashed. Giving these cultists the middle finger, he cuts off the projected state without a second of delay.Let these crazy people continue their crazy crap, I\u2019m going back home to the Vanished.At the same time, on the vast expanse of the sea, a rhythmic footstep echoed along the deck of the Vanished. This was Alice, the puppet doll in her long gothic dress, coming up to the captain\u2019s room. She wants to ask Duncan some questions, and she remembers well from the captain that he\u2019s in the room here.Alice has a good memory\u2026.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Not for the content though, but why she\u2019s able to recognize \u201cwords\u201d in general.Alice had no memory of learning how to read; in fact, she did not have any memory of \u201clearning\u201d at all, nor did she remember where she had accumulated the experience of moving outside and talking to people. So, where does all this knowledge come from? A doll that\u2019s been sleeping inside a wooden coffin shouldn\u2019t know anything!Alice had never considered this question before until today, but somehow, after talking to \u201cCaptain Duncan,\u201d the concept of \u201ccuriosity\u201d somehow sprouted in the doll\u2019s mind, which was supposed to function peacefully forever without disturbance.Looking back carefully, this change seemed to have arisen after Duncan asked about the origin of the name \u201cAlice\u201d\u2026The doll didn\u2019t know whether this change was good or bad, but she didn\u2019t like the feeling of not knowing and being confused. Quickly shaking the discomfort aside, the doll adjusted her mentality and put her hand on the door handle to push it slightly.But the door didn\u2019t budge.Alice hesitated for a moment and tried again but found the door unbudging like it\u2019s been molded out of pure steel.Then, just as she was about to try again, a voice suddenly came out of the captain\u2019s quarter\u2014a hoarse, low voice, as if coming from a piece of decaying wood: \u201cThe door is open, Lady.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t Captain Duncan\u2019s voice, causing Alice to flinch back from startlement. However, she was able to regain herself quickly and tried again by pulling \u2013 this time it opened smoothly without resistance.It was only then that she remembered. The last time she was here, Captain Duncan had also pulled the door to open it for them both.It looks like \u201clife knowledge\u201d is still only knowledge, it\u2019s not actual experience\u2026.Reflecting on herself, Alice carefully probed her head into the captain\u2019s quarter to find it empty aside from the goat head statue on the mapping table.\u201cPlease come in, Lady. The captain is busy so you can wait for him here until he finishes,\u201d the goat head spoke more politely than Alice had imagined. \u201cAlso, try to avoid probing your head inside like this in the future. Other overly sensitive individuals on the Vanished will mistake the gesture as you hating them. Appeasing that bunch afterward will be troublesome, and what if your head falls off again? I don\u2019t have hands so picking it up for you will be problematic\u2026\u201dReally talked! This wood statue is really talking!Although Captain Duncan had mentioned before that the goat head on the mapping table could speak, Alice was stunned nevertheless to hear it for herself. Taking a moment before replying: \u201cUh, okay, but my head won\u2019t actually fall off so easily. Also, didn\u2019t I manage to put it back on by myself? But wait\u2026. Did you say overly sensitive ones? Are there others on the ship?\u201d Alice quickly picked up on this point and grew both surprised and nervous all of a sudden.\u201cIs that so strange to hear? It takes a lot of manpower to man a ship as big as this one. Do you think the great Captain Duncan would wash the deck by himself?\u201d The goat head\u2019s explanation actually sounded reasonable.Although Alice felt something was wrong still with her not very bright head, she nevertheless nodded after a good minute. \u201cWhat you said makes sense\u2026. So where are the others on the Vanished?\u201d\u201cThere is only one loyal first mate of the captain, the rest are a bunch of guys with less brains than a rock so you don\u2019t have to think about communicating with them. Also, they have no interest in communicating with people,\u201d the goat head interrupted her without waiting for Alice to finish. \u201cBut considering that you are a newcomer to the ship, it is normal that there are many reasons and rules that you do not know. As Captain Duncan\u2019s most loyal first and second mate\u2026 I will instruct you on some common sense that will allow you to survive on this ship. After all, the captain will not lower himself in explaining such things to the newcomer\u2026 Are you ready, Lady?\u201dAlice stupidly listened in on what the goat head had to say and even forgot what her original purpose was in coming. Eventually, her mind became such a dizzying mess that she could only subconsciously nod: \u201cAh, uh, ok-okay?\u201d\u201cVery well, then next are a few rules that the crew of the Vanished must know, which will help the newcomers adapt to the environment faster and accept the blessings from the Great Captain Duncan and the Vanished\u2026.\u201dThe goat head was obviously satisfied with Alice\u2019s answer because the pride from the goat head\u2019s mouth was growing in strides.\u201cFirst, Captain Duncan is the absolute master of the Vanished. He is always right. Even if reality conflicts with Captain Duncan\u2019s wording, it is subject to Captain Duncan\u2019s judgment.\u201d\u201cSecond, crew members can only move in the areas allowed by the captain. No one is ever allowed in the areas forbidden by him.\u201d\u201cThird, if you step into an unauthorized area and are lucky enough to survive temporarily, you must stay there until the captain comes for you. Otherwise, only death awaits the foolish ones. You are absolutely not allowed to return without permission.\u201d\u201cFourth, the Vanished is always sailing on the right course. Do not question the captain\u2019s plan. If you find that the scenery around the Vanished is different from what you expected, or if the ship fell into a \u2018deeper\u2019 part of the sea, it\u2019s also part of the normal voyage.\u201d\u201cFifth, the captain will occasionally leave the ship, but he will certainly return. During the captain\u2019s departure, the Vanished will continue to sail as planned. Also, crew members are not allowed to go near the helm station at the stern during that period\u2014the rudder system is insecure when the captain leaves so the cables there will strangle any daredevil that shows signs of \u2018usurpation.\u2019\u201cSixth, on the Vanished, there are basically only six rules for the crew.\u201cSeventh, the door to the captain\u2019s quarter only opens outward.\u201dThe goat head seems to have popularized this \u201ccommon sense\u201d to the new crew more than once. It sounded so natural and smooth that Alice had to take a second to notice the conflicting information: \u201cWait. Mr. Goathead, you just said there are only six articles\u2026\u201d\u201cSixth, on the Vanished, there are basically only six rules for the crew.\u201d The goat head replied at once and repeated his words.Alice wondered if one of them had broke somewhere: \u201cBut you just mentioned the seventh article\u2026\u201d\u201cSeventh, the door to the captain\u2019s quarter only opens outward.\u201d The goat head answered very naturally.Alice stared at the goat head with a face of WTF. After a bit more doubt, she finally confirmed this must be how things work on the Vanished: \u201cDon\u2019t you think its contradicting?\u201d\u201cThere is no contradiction.\u201d Listening to the goat\u2019s determined answer, Alice eventually stuffed the question back down after meeting those obsidian black eyes.There are some things better left unsaid, even a doll knows that!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As for the seventh, nothing was stopping her from remembering it as well.But she still had some doubts: \u201cJust now, I tried pushing the door of the captain\u2019s room. Why does it only open outwards and needs emphasizing in the rules?\u201dThe goat head stared silently into Alice\u2019s eyes, and after two full seconds, he spoke so sternly and concisely that it was shocking: \u201cSometimes, it can open inward.\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you see the door open inward, don\u2019t go in, for on the entire Vanished, only the captain is qualified to do so.\u201dAlice was startled by the other\u2019s extraordinarily solemn attitude. However, the goat head\u2019s tone briskly changed yet again in the next: \u201cAlright, the necessary introduction for the new crew member has ended. Now let\u2019s talk about something else\u2026 Oh yes, Lady, what\u2019s your purpose in coming to the captain\u2019s room? If you are unfamiliar with the facilities on the ship, then there is no need to bother the great Captain Duncan. But you came to the right place if you want someone to talk to. I am very good at finding topics and know countless great stories about this ship\u2026 Are you not interested in its great deeds? I can also introduce you to the most famous dishes on the Boundless Sea, and I know a little about cooking too\u2026\u201dAlice tried several times to interrupt the goat head during his long spiel, and it was already too late when she realized something was wrong.Anomaly 099, the puppet Miss Alice, faces the second greatest horror on the Vanished today besides Captain Duncan.At the same time, in the bedroom, which was separated from them by only one wall, Duncan quietly listened to the movement coming from the mapping room.He had just woken up when the conversation first began so he didn\u2019t interrupt the pair. Thankfully so, otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to hear about the \u201ccrew codes\u201d and the door to his bedroom opening outwards.So\u2026. The ship\u2019s \u201creal Captain Duncan\u201d would have also pushed open the door to the captain\u2019s cabin and headed for some mysterious \u201cworld\u201d? And this happened more than once that the goat head presumed this as a matter of course?The news was good for Duncan, which meant he didn\u2019t have to worry about returning to the other side later. This way, it won\u2019t look odd when more crew members arrive.But on the other hand, Duncan also had an inevitable worry in mind\u2014it had to do with the \u201c6+1\u2033 crew code that the goat head deliberately mentioned.What exactly do these crew codes mean? From the surface, it sounded grotesque, dangerous, and even contradictory. However, the truth couldn\u2019t be further from that. It\u2019s clearly meant to restrict the crew\u2019s behavior while on board so that they could survive in some dangerous environment.Duncan frowned at the idea, trying to judge his own place among these codes. He\u2019s undoubtedly the adjudicator of some of these risks and seemingly with the greatest freedom on the vessel\u2026. But that\u2019s under the premise he\u2019s the real Captain Duncan.\u201dThis was the most worrying part.But he suddenly remembered his own exploration on the Vanished, and the fact that he was walking around the cabin at will. The goat head never reminded himself of the crew code and saw himself as the real Captain Duncan.Based on this fact, the dangers mentioned by the goat head may not necessarily be true for himself.Duncan exhaled softly and continued to listen in on the conversation, only to regret he couldn\u2019t turn off his ears half a minute later.Round one of the battles between the silly doll versus the annoying goat head commences; who\u2019s going to overwhelm the other one? First, it was the doll\u2019s nonsensical blabbing of the wind and waves from Alice; then, it\u2019s the annoying yapping of the goat head in return. No matter how much Duncan wanted information, such an attack on his conscious wouldn\u2019t be good.However, right as he\u2019s about to head out of his bedroom to stop the two, he stops. Duncan had just finished a miraculous soul journey, and there was plenty of intelligence he needed to sort and sum up. Why should he interfere when both parties were clearly enjoying each other\u2019s company? This gives him an excuse to stay in his bedroom while not paying attention.Silently saying sorry to Miss Doll, Duncan shifted his attention down to his right hand where he froze up.The brass compass, which was slightly larger than a pocket watch, had disappeared at some point without him realizing it!Duncan\u2019s eyes were momentarily troubled, for this was the first time he eased up his awareness since arriving on this strange eerie ghost ship \u2013 a mistake that could\u2019ve been lethal.The next second, he flicked his finger to pop a puff of green flame out. He wanted to use his connection with the ship to scan for any abnormal entities hiding in his bedroom, but in the instant of getting up, a subtle connection suddenly emerged from the bottom of his heart. Out of reflex, he looked up and saw several illusory feathers falling down from the air.Amazed by this finding, Duncan stared even harder and saw what it was \u2013 a phantom figure rapidly emerging from the void. It was about three or so seconds later, but the black phantom had become a snowy-white thing\u2026Specifically, a dove that had the missing compass hanging from its neck. There\u2019s also a new obsidian knife lying quietly next to the bird\u2019s feet.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There\u2019s wisdom in those slightly reddened bird eyes, and the two green irises were clearly reflecting his image.\u201cA\u2026 Dove?\u201dAfter stalling for several seconds, Duncan finally started to mutter something under his breath.Why a dove? Why did a dove suddenly pop up? Why is my brass compass still hanging on this bird\u2019s neck? How did that dagger come about?All in all, a thousand words could be summed up in one sentence: Can something normal happen for once on this abnormal ship?!And when Duncan\u2019s side was full of question marks and complaints, the dove that had been there for half a day seemed to have finally \u201cwoken up\u201d. Nodding its head and taking two steps forward on the table, the bird stretched its neck up at Duncan\u2019s direction and made a loud \u201cgoogoo\u201d sound.Duncan stared wordlessly at this, somehow coming up with the image of a classical pirate captain from his memories. \u201cHaving a bird on my shoulder does fit that picture, but shouldn\u2019t it normally be a parrot instead\u2026. So what\u2019s the deal with a white dove?\u201dThe bird seemingly overheard the remark and nodded its head again. Then, to the captain\u2019s dismay, the dove spoke with a strange and feministic voice: \u201cTeleportation is complete!\u201dAny sort of murmuring and thought instantly vaporized from Duncan\u2019s side. Nearly choking from his own saliva at the shock, he glared at the white dove with a confused expression and a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu from when he first met the goat head.But this was not the first day he came to the Vanished. After the brief surprise, he immediately regained his composure and summoned up a puff of green flame from one hand and stared at the bird with a guarded posture: \u201cWhere are you from?\u201dThe dove tilted its head, one eye looking straight at Duncan, the other up at the ceiling: \u201cThe address is wrong. Please reconfirm the address again, or contact the system administrator.\u201dDuncan: \u201c\u2026?\u201dCompared to his expression\u2019s momentary sluggishness, a bigger wave of shock had set off in his heart!This dove had said something\u2026 not of the style from this world. No one should be speaking like this here, not Alice, not the goat head, and absolutely not the hooded cultists from his soul journey. The term should only be familiar to someone like him, \u201cZhou Ming\u201d, an earthling!However, the bird did not seem to notice the change between Duncan\u2019s eyes and expression at all. Pecking its winging for a quick clean, the dove started to pace freely around the table until it ran up to the obsidian dagger used by the cultists. Then speaking with the same strange and feministic voice like before: \u201cTake up this solar tomahawk and embrace the glory of battle!\u201dDuncan jerked up from his desk and caused the chair underneath to tip over backward, making a harsh crashing sound as a result.The reason? Because the phrase there was not of this world!Perhaps due to the loud commotion, Duncan suddenly got a direct inquiry from the goat head: \u201cCaptain, are you okay?\u201dStill staring at the dove on the table, he replied calmly since the goat head wouldn\u2019t peek into his personal quarter: \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\u201cMiss Alice has come to see you. Do you want to\u2026\u201d\u201cYou meet with her first.\u201d\u201cYes, Captain.\u201dDuncan exhaled heavily and then glanced back at the door leading out to the mapping room. Immediately, the bombardment of stupid topics continued with the wooden statue and Alice, the latter trying multiple times to get up and leave only to be stopped by the former.He promises to apologize to the doll later, but for now, this earthling has more important matters to attend to.Taking a seat back in front of his desk, Duncan wanted to try communicating with the dove when he suddenly noticed a detail he hadn\u2019t noticed until now \u2013 a strand of fire was vaguely stretching out from his right finger and connecting to the bird\u2019s wing.This made Duncan frown. He thought about what this meant, then as a test, he flicked his right hand. Next thing he knew, the bird had disappeared in an instant and reappeared on his shoulder, pecking his hair while making a googoo sound!Raising an eyebrow, he flicks his finger again to test the theory. Sure enough, the dove disappears and reappears on the table. However, unlike the last, the compass hanging around the bird\u2019s neck radiated a green glow this time.Duncan frowned, \u201c\u2026 Is it related to this brass compass?\u201dThere\u2019s certainly a connection between the dove and himself, even closer than the connection between him and the Vanished, which might also explain why the bird \u201cknew\u201d about that \u201cphrase\u201d from Earth that only he knew. Now the question was why did this dove appear now?Going back and forth in his mind, Duncan eventually focused in on the spooky brass compass.From testing the ghost fire to the present, everything had begun with this compass. Whether it was the previous soul journey into the corpse, the item\u2019s disappearance, or the dove\u2019s emergence, it\u2019s all sourced from this compass.Determined to find out why, Duncan reached out for the item to study.The dove was surprisingly unaversive to his touch. However, instead of feeling the metallic hardness, his finger directly went through the compass and touched the feathers instead!The dove jumped a few times in place at the tickle, exclaiming wildly in protest: \u201cToday is KFC Crazy Thursday, half price\u2026.\u201dTwitching in the corner of his eye, Duncan tried several more times at this gesture. Eventually, he concluded the compass wasn\u2019t coming off and had obviously been bound to the dove.Or rather, maybe the compass\u2019s real body was the bird itself?Duncan had no way to confirm his speculations at the moment, but for now, he needed an excuse to settle this dove on the ship.After a short thought, he decided to give the bird a name first.\u201cI\u2019ve got to give you a name,\u201d he said with a light tap of his finger on the table, \u201cI suppose you can understand me, right?\u201dThe bird tilted its head, and the two mung bean-sized eyes stared at Duncan wistfully, \u201cAi?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Then quickly repeated the name again in a louder voice than before: \u201cAi!\u201dDuncan finally understood what the bird meant: \u201cYou mean your name is Ai?\u201dThe dove nodded proudly and paced around the desk: \u201cGoogoo!\u201dDuncan couldn\u2019t help but rub his forehead over how strange it was communicating with this dove. It\u2019s even more awkward than speaking with the goat head in his opinion. \u201cDo you know how you were born? Or rather\u2026 how did you end up here?\u201dThe dove thought for a moment before both of them looked in different directions: \u201cAiya, the page you\u2019re looking for is missing, try refreshing it?\u201dDuncan: \u201c\u2026\u201dIt\u2019s nearly impossible to comprehend what was happening in the bird\u2019s head. But one thing\u2019s certain, the bird was sentient in its own way and communicated seriously. The problem was, did they both have the same understanding of what \u201ccommunication\u201d actually meant?Duncan continued his effort to talk with this dove called \u201cAi\u201d. Throughout their conversation, the bird gave a relevant answer to his questions on occasion. However, most replies were incoherent messes that didn\u2019t relate.In the end, little progress was made, leaving the captain frowning: \u201cWhat kind of messed up thing is this\u2026.\u201dUnfazed by the displeasure from the human, the dove crouched down on the table and started roosting while occasionally nagging for V50.Duncan didn\u2019t care about the bird\u2019s chanting, instead curled his fingers and rubbed them gently. As he watched the glowing green flame on his fingertip, the guy was sure of one thing \u2013 the compass and dove were essentially an \u201canomaly item\u201d that he could control.Putting it to the test, he raised the size of the flame\u2019s intensity. Sure enough, the flame around Ai blew up with the pointer inside the compass beginning to slow down like it wanted to point in some direction.Ai didn\u2019t react the whole time though despite being engulfed in fire, merely just bathing itself in the ghost fire and awaiting orders.Then before the brass compass could be fully activated, Duncan took the initiative to disperse the flames.Silently summing up his findings:\u201cFirst, the compass can still be used\u2026 It\u2019s just that there is an extra weird \u2018medium\u2019 now. For the time being, it is not certain what effect this dove will bring, nor should I go on another soul journey until I\u2019m fully prepared.\u201d\u201cSecondly, there is definitely a connection between the dove and me, and this connection will become more pronounced in the case of the fire. To some extent, I can also control the dove\u2026 perhaps even go further than just control\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2018Ai\u2019 clearly has its own will and will act according to its own thoughts. Therefore, my orders are not absolute for her, which is different from the other items on the Vanished.\u201d\u201cCan speak, has a certain ability to think, can judge problems independently\u2026 Compared with the ordinary anomalies, this dove\u2019s nature seems closer to that of the goat head\u2026\u201dDuncan summed up some of the information now known to him and finally shifted his attention to that cursed obsidian black dagger.After a little thought, Duncan reached out and picked up the item, which the priest in that underground sewer used. The cold, hard touch at contact told him it was real.After confirming its not another illusion, Duncan unleashed a little more of his ghost fire, causing the flames to wrap around the blade\u2019s body. Judging from the empty feedback, the extraordinary power contained within this ritual blade had indeed dissipated.As he had previously judged at the sacrificial sight, this thing was not really an \u201canomaly\u201d item but an extension of some extraordinary power or a temporary vessel \u201cinfused\u201d with energy artificially.Although Duncan did not know what kind of system the \u201canomalies\u201d used, he could take a close guess that this blade shouldn\u2019t be a rare item\u2026 more like some mass-produced product.\u201cThis is what you brought back?\u201d He lifted his head and faced Ai, \u201cAnd it\u2019s for me?\u201dThe dove stared straight into Duncan\u2019s eyes with those reddish bean irises without replying.Duncan: \u201c\u2026?\u201dHe asked again, and the dove still didn\u2019t move, as if it had suddenly become a lifeless sculpture.The sudden abnormal change made Duncan frown slightly, but just as he was about to stimulate Ai with the ghost flame to see if he could forcibly wake it up, the bird suddenly \u201ccame alive\u201d. Jumping twice in place and shouting, \u201cTake this solar tomahawk, take this solar tomahawk, take this\u2026\u201d\u201cOkay, I get it. You don\u2019t have to answer every question I ask,\u201d Duncan quickly waved his hand to force the dove to quiet down. Organizing his language first, \u201cThen do you know how you brought this dagger here? Or rather, you can carry \u2018physical objects\u2019 through the space tunnel, right?\u201dThe dove pondered for a moment before pecking Duncan\u2019s finger: \u201cThe whole place is full, and the chicken pieces are free of charge.\u201dDuncan: \u201cI\u2026 I\u2019ll pretend to understand.\u201dHe sighed, thinking he had reached the limit of communication with this bird.Then he got up from his desk and turned to face the door leading to the mapping room. He could still hear the exchanging conversation of the goat head and Alice outside, which was going on rather well with the former going over the seventeenth recipe for kelp stew.At this moment, Duncan felt compelled to save his only (and most normal) crew member.On the other hand, he had been in the bed chamber for far too long. It\u2019s time he showed his face to reassure the goat head.But before leaving, he hesitantly glanced at Ai, who was running around the table again.Do I want to take this dove out too? How do I explain it to them when I do?Duncan hesitated for only two seconds before decisively grabbing the dove and placing it on his shoulder.If he\u2019s going to be active on the Vanished for the foreseeable future, he would need to be more open about certain secrets. Also, hiding a speaking, walking bird on the ship would never end well. What would the other crew members think of his image if they suddenly came across Ai one day?So, he might as well graciously take the dove out and say it was his new \u201cbooty\u201d\u2014he didn\u2019t need to explain anything to the goat head in the first place. After all, the first mate of this ship would fill in the details on his own regardless.As for the strange stories that this dove pops up from time to time (the locals in this world would find it incomprehensible anyway) that doesn\u2019t need to be explained either.Let the goat head and Alice find a way to make up for it.With the fat dove on his shoulder, Duncan freely straightened his posture and calmly walked out of the bed chamber.\u201cAuthentic good herbal tea, authentic good voice, welcome to watch\u2026\u201d The dove proudly straightened its chest as well and shouted as if announcing its entry.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If not, a monkey will do too!But he had already pushed open the door to the mapping room, meaning it was impossible to turn around.Right now, the goat head was happily chanting away about the twelfth legend of the fish stew in his repertoire when Duncan interrupted his noisy blabbing. \u201cAH, captain! You\u2019re finally out. I must tell you; Miss Alice is such a wonderful conversation partner. I haven\u2019t had such a good conversation in years, you know\u2026\u201dDuncan directly ignored the goat head\u2019s loud blabbing and turned to face the victim sitting across the table, whom had placed her own head on the table with those hands firmly pressed against the ears.Duncan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cShe pulled her head off herself,\u201d the goat head explained without waiting for Duncan to speak, \u201cthough I don\u2019t know why she did it\u2026\u201dHow powerful is the nagging of the goat head to make a cursed doll behead herself to avoid the sound waves?!At the same time as Duncan was shocked, the goat head had also noticed the strange bird brought out by the captain. His obsidian black eyes were staring hard at Ai: \u201cHuh, Captain, on your shoulder is\u2026\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s called Ai, and it\u2019s my pet from now on,\u201d Duncan said with as little detail as possible to avoid possible loopholes.\u201cYour pet?\u201d The goat head obviously froze for a moment, and then it acted as if it\u2019s come to a decision: \u201cAh, I did sense your departure from the Vanished earlier\u2026. You take a spirit walk? This must be the loot you brought back from the trip into the spirit world.\u201dSpirit walk?Duncan immediately brought up the image of the compass in his head over this new term. Considering how he had just experienced a soul projection for himself, this must be something commonly done by the real Captain Duncan. Nodding his head indifferently: \u201cI went out for a stroll.\u201dThe goat head promptly chased the reply with compliments: \u201cAh! Truly worthy of the great Captain Duncan, even a simple spirit walk can bring back treasures. Is this a dove? If it can become your pet, then it must be something extraordinary. You even hung your compass on it. Is this\u2026 of course, your decision and judgment are always correct. But what is special about this dove? Is it\u2026\u201dPicking up on a key point from the goat head\u2019s flattery, Duncan realized the compass must be an important treasure to the real captain. Otherwise, this statue wouldn\u2019t have put so much emphasis on the item.But nothing he could do now. The compass was \u201cbound\u201d to the dove, and\u2026 according to the feedback of the ghost fire, the dove seemed more like the real body of the compass than vice-versa!Thinking fast with an unwavering expression, Duncan was trying to come up with something to say when Ai suddenly jumped off his shoulder and flew in front of the goat head with its flapping wings.\u201cWant to charge Q coin or no?\u201d The bird pecks the statue and asks.Duncan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cAn anomaly with intelligence?!\u201d The goat head was also stunned by how it spoke, \u201cThis dove can talk?!\u201dDuncan immediately gave a euphemistic reminder: \u201cYou can also talk.\u201d\u201cLike words, like words, like words\u2026\u201d The dove Ai paced around the table and spoke to no one in specific.Duncan snapped his fingertips as he saw this, and with the sudden flicker of green flame, the dove pacing on the table disappeared in a blink of an eye and returned to the shoulder.\u201cYes, it\u2019s an intellectual anomaly, and it is under my direct control,\u201d Duncan nodded to the goat head, \u201cis there any problem?\u201dThe goat head hurriedly replied, \u201cAh\u2026 Of course not, of course not, there is no problem at all. Everything is as the great Captain Duncan wills it.\u201dIgnoring the goat head before the conversation overextends itself, Duncan turns to face Alice. Patting the doll on the shoulder: \u201cWake up, wake up.\u201dAlice\u2019s body stirred over the intervention. As if awakened from a long nightmare, she started to stammer some words while trying to speak: \u201cCap\u2026 Cap\u2026 Cap\u2026\u201dDuncan: \u201cPut your head back on first.\u201dWidening her eyes as it hit her, Alice hurriedly plopped her own head back on the neck with an audible click. Only then did her speech return to normal: \u201cAh, Captain, you are back? Just now it seems to have\u2026 Mr. Goathead is finished?\u201dThe statue on the table immediately chimes in: \u201cNo, we were just about to go over the legend regarding the fish stew. The next topic is\u2026.\u201d\u201cShut up,\u201d Duncan sternly orders.\u201cOkay.\u201dAlice visibly shook when the goat head attempted to continue. It\u2019s quite apparent she\u2019s been horrified by the experience and showed fear in her eyes. In fact, Duncan had the strong speculation that Miss Doll here wouldn\u2019t want to step into his quarter\u2019s again for the next while.Thinking of this, he finally got back to the main subject, \u201cWhat did you need?\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d Alice\u2019s expression was a little dull, as if her original goal of visiting the captain\u2019s quarter had been forgotten with the conversation between her and the statue. Then a few seconds later: \u201cAh yes, I wanted to ask if there\u2019s a place to take a bath on the ship. I got soaked with seawater before so my joints are a bit uncomfortable\u2026.\u201d At the end, the expression on Miss Doll\u2019s face was blushing red with embarrassment.In hindsight, Duncan also felt embarrassed over the matter. He did, after all, throw the lady overboard several times.Unchanging in his voice: \u201cIs that all?\u201dAlice sat reservedly in her chair, \u201cYes\u2026 that is all.\u201d\u201cFor many ocean-going ships, fresh water is an extremely valuable resource so bathing is a luxury that needs restraint.\u201d Duncan said solemnly at first but then suddenly formed a smile, \u201cBut you are lucky, the Vanished is not an ordinary ship so fresh water is not a problem here. Come with me. There is a bathing place in the cabin below the middle deck. To get there, you have to go through the upper deck first.\u201dAlice stood up at once\u2014she really didn\u2019t want to spend another second in this room with the goat head.\u201cYou continue to take the helm,\u201d Duncan glanced back and ordered.After he had finished his explanation, the pair soon came out to the main deck where the night sky was abnormally clear today. Unlike in the past, the world was always gloomy with dark clouds hovering over his head. This time around though, he could see as far as the eye could see, which was a lot.For example, there weren\u2019t any stars up there, or a moon for that matter. Instead, there\u2019s only a gaping crack of faint glowing grayish-white running across the world from end to end. If he had to describe this image, it would be someone cutting open a wound across the heavens and leaving it there.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A star out of billions of stars in the galaxy. As long as this remains true, it means the world was somehow connected to the Earth, his home world. But this though, there\u2019s no celestial body at all. He couldn\u2019t even discern if there was a distance from here to Earth anymore.Duncan didn\u2019t say anything over his own woes and just stared up at the glowing crack. He had a lot of questions that had no answers.Where are the other planets? Do they even exist over here? Or is it\u2026 the world beneath my feet is a celestial body located in a cosmic vacuum, and its distance from other stars is so far away that the night sky here is pitch black and starless? What is the pale scar that stretches across the sky? Is it a torn gap in space? Is it a touchable celestial structure? Or is it just an illusion floating above this treacherous expanse of the sea?\u201cCaptain?\u201d Finally, a voice awakened Duncan from the side. Alice with his stammering and nervous voice, \u201cAre you okay? Is the weather about to change? Is a big storm coming? I\u2019ve heard seafarers mention this outside my box\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 It\u2019s nothing.\u201d Duncan said softly and then withdrew his gaze from the sky while repeating the phrase, \u201cit\u2019s nothing at all.\u201d\u201cThen we\u2026\u201dDuncan stepped forward, his expression calm as if nothing had happened: \u201cLet\u2019s go. I\u2019ll take you to the cabin. You can wash up there later if you need to.\u201dOnce again, the world has shown outsiders its weirdness with no seeming end to this either.Duncan had realized that he didn\u2019t know how many more shocking visions awaited him in the future, and if he made a fuss every time, he would probably only be left with astonishment in his life.If there was any experience he has accumulated over the past few decades of life on Earth, there\u2019s one that was most useful today:If a problem exists, find a way to solve it since it wouldn\u2019t disappear on its own because of one\u2019s denial, just as the grotesque sky in front of you would not become a starry appearance because of his doubts.No matter how absurd and strange the phenomenon was, this was an irrefutable objective fact since everything existed here. Not understanding why was his problem, not this world. Nevertheless, what he has now is time, and there\u2019s plenty of it as the captain of the Vanished.Alice didn\u2019t know the reason for the captain\u2019s silence along the way, only that the atmosphere around Duncan had suddenly become somewhat depressed. But after reaching the targeted cabin, this oppressive feeling abruptly disappeared again.The place arrived at was a place one could bath, a bathroom specially prepared for upper seafarers on this classical ship. Under no circumstances are normal sailors permitted inside due to the harsh living conditions on this vessel. After all, sail-powered ships from the ancient era were not well equipped due to their limits. Often seeing spoiled food and poor medical treatments on board. If not for the industrial age, such harsh challenges would continue to this day as a plague on seafarers.But ironically, on this ghost ship whom everyone fears, such poor living conditions had been resolved entirely by the freshwater tanks automatically refreshing themselves. As for the food in the warehouse, there are no signs of spoilage either. That leaves only the health conditions of the crew. A ghost captain could never get sick, and Alice\u2019s spinal problem had nothing to do with the ship so that\u2019s unrelated.\u201cThe pipe next to the bath leads to the freshwater tank. You can fill the bin over there with it to wash. But there\u2019s no hot water due to the ship\u2019s limited condition. Keep this in mind.\u201dDuncan went ahead and introduced Alice to the other facilities and even took the chance to go over the mundane stuff he had experienced over the past few days.\u201cI\u2019m fine as long as I can rinse some of my joints.\u201d Alice was not picky at all. She examined all of the things inside the bathroom with curiosity and nodded: \u201cI\u2019m just a puppet, I don\u2019t have any desire for hot baths.\u201dDuncan nodded in understanding. Then with a hesitant voice: \u201cSpeaking of which, do you know how to take a bath? Do you have this\u2026 \u2018life experience\u2019?\u201dAlice paused for a moment, then said in a heavy voice, \u201cIt should be\u2026 Okay? I\u2019m only removing my joints to rinse them. I\u2019ll put them back right afterward\u2026.\u201dDuncan: \u201c\u2026?\u201dThe two stared at each other like they were both lost on what to make of this.\u201cHave you considered how to put yourself back together after dismantling?\u201d Duncan took the lead in breaking this awkwardness. He knew Alice had never done this before, so he needed to remind her of this fact. \u201cI can\u2019t help you regarding this.\u201dAlice: \u201cNow that you mention it\u2026\u201d\u201cI strongly recommend against disassembling your joints often,\u201d Duncan reminded in a serious tone, \u201ceven if your body structure allows you to do so.\u201dAlice was a little confused: \u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s easy to lose them if they\u2019re dismantled.\u201d Duncan finally said what he worried about the most. Unlike in the movies, where a cursed doll never needs to worry about losing its body parts, a real moving doll must. Like a toy he had as a child. If he\u2019s careless for even a day, the likely chance of him finding the part will fall dramatically due to forgetting its placement.Speaking of this, he paused and added: \u201cYour cervical spine problem is serious enough.\u201dAlice imagined the picture for a moment and shrunk her neck in the next: \u201cAh, okay, I understand\u2026 I think I know what to do\u2026.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s for the best,\u201d said Duncan with a worried expression. Then before taking his leave, \u201cI have a lot of things to do so try not to get into too much trouble.\u201d\u201cOkay Captain, thank you Captain,\u201d Alice said happily. But just as Duncan was about to walk out of the cabin, she suddenly spoke again, \u201cOh right, Captain\u2026\u201dDuncan stopped and tilted his head slightly, \u201cWhat else?\u201d\u201cCaptain\u2026 I suddenly feel like you\u2019re not so scary either.\u201d Alice looked at Duncan\u2019s back and carefully considered her words, \u201cMr. Goathead said you are the most terrible captain on the Boundless Sea, the elusive scourge of all the shipping routes, but\u2026\u201d\u201cBut what?\u201d\u201cBut I find that you\u2019re a good talker and a bit of a caring parent\u2026\u201dDuncan didn\u2019t look back when he suddenly asked, \u201cWhere did you get the concept of family from? Do you have a family?\u201dAlice hesitated for a moment as she slowly shook her head: \u201cIt seems there is not.\u201d\u201cThen don\u2019t bring up the topic of parents anymore. Stay on the ship honestly, and I will make arrangements for your living standards.\u201d\u201cOh, alright, Captain.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Then again, the bacon jerky and hard cheese could hardly satiate his appetite anyways. Nevertheless, he will not complain when they\u2019re not rotted after being stored on board for over a century.On top of this, there\u2019s also an inadequate supply of alternative clothes for Alice. (Though the cursed doll hadn\u2019t mentioned it) Nevertheless, this won\u2019t do for him. At the very least, he needed more stuff to pass the hour during the down times.Sure, the Boundless Sea was vast and plentiful, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s easy for the Vanished to procure new supplies. For one, there\u2019s no port they could dock for repairs and supplies, let alone open communication with civilized society.Drifting so blindly on the sea forever was an inefficient means of exploration. Obtaining Information about this world must be from the land; this was Duncan\u2019s deepest impression after \u201cwalking through the spirit world\u201d.Putting that aside, even if it\u2019s for his own physical and mental health, he had to try to get more in touch with the \u201ccity-states\u201d and civilized society of the world. Otherwise, he worries he might truly become twisted and gloomy like a real ghost captain.Thinking of this, Duncan turned his head slightly and looked at Ai, the dove who was obediently roosting on his shoulder and combing her feathers. His main focus remains on the compass hanging around the bird\u2019s neck.The dove tilted its head to look at its \u201cmaster\u201d and coldly said, \u201cSet up the base! Spread the pores! Hey, do you know how to operate or not?\u201dDuncan went silent for a moment over those words. The bird usually spouted unrelated nonsense, but she does occasionally utter some useful helpful stuff like right now.Although spirit walking does come with the risk of uncertainty and accidents like \u201cAi\u201d tagging along in the return, Duncan knew he must do so soon nonetheless. Not only to gather intelligence but also to verify and master a useful ability.If she can bring back the ritual blade, can she bring back more? What are the rules and restrictions on what this bird carries? Can this process be controlled artificially?After pondering for a moment, Duncan decided to ask the bird directly: \u201cDo you know how you brought that dagger back?\u201dThe dove thought for a moment and said in a deep tone, \u201cInsufficient crystals mines.\u201dDuncan: \u201c\u2026\u201dThat\u2019s enough. He\u2019s giving up on communicating with the bird for the time being. It\u2019s too much of a headache. Besides, what could be better than to personally test the theory out on his next trip?\u2026\u2026Inside the cabin, Alice finally figured out how to use the pipe for fetching water. She also managed to learn how to wash with the cold water. But for a doll, the cold temperature wasn\u2019t a problem at all.However, before jumping into the tub, Alice decides to greet everything in the cabin first.She patted the huge oak barrel, knocked on the pillar that supported the cabin, tapped the floor under her feet with her toes, and tiptoed up to pull the ropes and hooks hanging from the roof.\u201cHello, my name is Alice,\u201d she greeted the inanimate things happily, the same way she greeted the goat-headed gentleman from before, \u201cI\u2019m going to live on this ship from now on.\u201dNothing in the cabin responded to her greeting, but Alice didn\u2019t care in the slightest.The goat head said the Vanished was a living vessel, including the many things aboard.Although none of them seemed to have true \u201cintelligence\u201d like that of the goat head, or the ability to communicate, this did not prevent Alice from treating the entire Vanished as a \u201cneighbor\u201d who needed to be greeted.The Vanished was a living object, and so was she.Convinced that her greeting was polite and decent, Alice\u2019s mood became more pleasant, and then she shed her ornate dress and awkwardly climbed into the oak barrel that had been filled with water.The first step was to remove her head and rinse it since the joints around her neck aren\u2019t very strong. It\u2019s a reasonable choice in Miss Doll\u2019s mind, removing her head\u2026.\u2026\u2026The late pale night has finally descended upon the City-State of Pland, bringing an end to the hustle and bustle of the city. It\u2019s time to sleep for this this prosperous \u201cpearl of the sea\u201d.But in the quiet darkness, the night watchman remains on alert, watching and protecting those who slumber.On the \u201cBig Clock Tower\u201d, the tallest building in the city, a tall young woman with long grayish-white hair stands in front of the window overlooking the city.The lady\u2019s facial features were top-notch, but a noticeable scar across her left eye marred her beauty. As a woman, she\u2019s definitely on the tall size, higher than most men around here, and she was obviously well trained with healthy-proportioned muscles in that armored dress. Also, the lady brandished quite the sword on her waist. Inscribed with runes symbolizing the waves, the blade embodied her faith.Meanwhile, the sound of mechanical operation could constantly be heard behind the lady. Steam engines, the grinding of rods, and the pumping of pistons, these are all the mechanical marvels running this magnificent clock tower overseeing the entire settlement.Judging by the sound, this large and sophisticated machine was in good working order, and no evil forces were invading the sacred steam core tonight.But a faint uneasiness still plagued Inquisitor Vanna\u2019s heart. She believed something terrible would happen for some reason, and she was doomed to failure in stopping it.Eventually, footsteps from the direction of the stairs caught the lady\u2019s attention. It\u2019s a priest carrying a copper incense burner to replace the already used one hanging up on the guardrails. Once done with his work, the faithful made sure the smoke from the incense floated smoothly into the air and around the gears before whispering the name of the storm goddess.Then turning to face Vanna, \u201cGood evening, Your Honor, are you personally taking the night watch again?\u201d\u201cI keep having this bad hunch over the past few days, especially tonight.\u201d\u201cBad hunch? In what direction? The priest looked up, his heavy eyes concerned, \u201cThe storm goddess gave you an omen?\u201d\u201cNot a clear message,\u201d the young female inquisitor shook her head, \u201cI vaguely feel\u2026 that there\u2019s something close to the city.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In return for this privilege, devout believers who acted in god\u2019s name would gain the ability to glimpse into the future and the direction it takes.This kind of voyeurism was not bound by time and space and implied the risk of being eroded by subspace. But for those determined and devout believers, this dangerous and powerful force was what allowed them to protect the fragile light of civilization in this endless ocean.For this pious inquisitor, a similar foresight had replayed itself in her dreams for many days now.She saw the Boundless Sea stained with a layer of ink with thunderous noises coming from the depths. Then with a loud splintering crack, the ocean splits apart in two, revealing a terrifying trench that reaches the very seabed. From within came a huge burning ship, rising from the depths into the air, its course, the city of Pland. Her home\u2026.In Inquisitor Vanna\u2019s life so far, the \u201comen\u201d of such sheer scale has appeared only twice.The first occurred during her childhood when she awoke from a blood-soaked nightmare and then lost her parents in a cultist attack. That incident left her scarred on the face for life.The second time had occurred four years earlier when she saw a dark sun rising from beneath the city grounds. That foresight led her to wipe out the biggest stronghold of the Sun God cultists hidden within the city.Now she finally got her third foresight \u2013 a flaming ghost ship was returning from the ocean\u2019s depth and would bring forth an indescribable giant into the world.So, she had lied to her fellow priest here tonight. The omen wasn\u2019t vague at all; it was so clear that she couldn\u2019t sleep for days as a result.The priest hesitated for a long time before speaking again: \u201cBut you didn\u2019t receive any negative feedback from the lord?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 The goddess doesn\u2019t necessarily remind you of all the risks, and sometimes the tribulations are the test,\u201d Vanna said quietly, \u201clet\u2019s drop this subject. What news do you have about the Adventurers Association?\u201dThe priest immediately nodded, \u201cOur mediator on the side of the association has just made contact using the relic inside their headquarters. But the communication device aboard the ship seems to have malfunctioned so we\u2019re not able to speak to the captain yet. We can only determine the ship is approaching the coast of Pland at normal speed.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 They disappeared from the perception of the holy relic, then reappeared out of thin air away from the intended route. We also can\u2019t make contact with the crew who had been tasked with transporting an anomaly object.\u201d Inquisitor Vanna\u2019s brow instantly furrowed at this detail because her intuition was raising all the red flags from years of experience, \u201cI remember that ship is called the White Oak, right?\u201d\u201cYes, White Oak, captained by Lawrence Creed, a member of the Adventurer\u2019s Association. He\u2019s an experienced sailor. Due to the cargo they\u2019re carrying, the ship had reported to the Church beforehand at City-State Rensa,\u201d said the priest while recalling what he knew. \u201cBy the way, the accompanying cleric aboard the ship is a registered priest of the Deep Sea Church.\u201d\u201cFellow brothers of the Church\u2026 Pray the situation is not too bad,\u201d said Vanna in a heavy tone, \u201cin short, the situation of the ship is not quite right. The entire route from Rensa to Pland is in the \u2018stable zone\u2019 under the control of the Adventurer\u2019s Association, but the ship managed to disappear from under the holy relic\u2019s watch\u2026 I suspect the White Oak had briefly left the fabrics of reality, or even\u2026. entered places it shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d\u201cInform the port guards that they are to keep an eye out for the ship. No one is allowed to disembark from the White Oak when it arrives until a full inspection is completed. Are the security forces aware of this yet?\u201d\u201cRest assured, your uncle\u2026 the Magistrate has ordered the officials to control the perimeter around the port and has raised the alert level. From now on until the level is lowered, all ships entering and leaving Pland will be on standby at the west dock.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good. Uncle has always been a cautious man,\u201d said Vanna, who finally relaxed a little with the tense expression on her face easing up, \u201cWe only need to make sure the common people inside the watch stay out of this matter.\u201dThe priest looked into Vanna\u2019s pale gray eyes, carefully choosing the most appropriate wording: \u201cYou think\u2026 Is that ship already \u2018polluted\u2019?\u201d\u201cIt is uncertain at this time, but even if a ship that has left the real world return shortly thereafter, it is rarely unscathed. It may be that some items on the ship have unconsciously evolved into an \u2018abnormal\u2019 item, or the crew\u2019s hearts have morphed into insanity. In the worst-case scenario, the real sailors had all been replaced by something entirely different\u2026. Regardless of the truth, any ship that came into contact with the supernatural must be treated with wariness.\u201d\u201cAlas\u2026 May that ship and its crew be all right,\u201d the priest could not help but put his hand across his chest and recite the name of the Storm Goddess, \u201cmay the Storm Goddess shelter those who bravely challenge the sea.\u201d\u201cMay they all be well,\u201d said Vanna softly. Then, lowering her eyes and whispering a blessing before following it up with a reminder, \u201cBut if they are unfortunate enough to not be \u2018well\u2019, we must also be prepared.\u201d\u201cYes, I understand,\u201d the priest said solemnly.But just as Vanna was about to refocus her attention on the city outside the window, a rush of footsteps suddenly came from the direction of the stairs.The next moment, a guardian in a silver-rimmed uniform that showed a dagger insignia across the chest ran over. \u201cInquisitor! We have found the underground sacrificial site of the cultists in the sewer! We also caught a group of those sun god believers!\u201dVanna\u2019s expression instantly got serious: \u201cThose cultists who worship the Dark Sun? Wait, you said you found a sacrifice point\u2026 Not a hiding place? How dare they hold another sacrifice?!\u201d\u201cYes, it was the site where the sacrificial ceremony was held. We found evidence that sacrifices had taken place,\u201d said the guardian quickly. \u201cWe also found many victims in the crypt not far from the site\u2014most of them having been sacrificed by gutting their hearts. It\u2019s just that something is not quite right at the site.\u201dVanna saw a look of absurdity and confusion on the guardian\u2019s face. Without hesitation, this female inquisitor picked up her heavy sword, blessed by the Storm Goddess, from the side and carried it on her back. Pointing to the stairs: \u201cLead the way. I will personally go examine the situation.\u201d\u201cYes Milady!\u201dThe sound of the huge sword banging against Vanna\u2019s metal pauldron was constantly ringing along the staircase. By the time they arrived at the entrance, two steam walkers were already parked outside in the square, rearing and steaming for her to get on that spider-like body.Vanna wasted no time and jumped atop the closest walker\u2019s carapace. The huge machine resembled one of those steampunk contraptions that you would find in a book, but this was far more refined and well-designed through generations of improvement.Pure technological creations could hardly exert enough influence on \u201canomalies\u201d or \u201cevents\u201d, but a crushing fire would most certainly remove any heretic that hides in the shadows. Of course, this hybrid of spider and tank could not be used inside the sewers due to its limited space. However, acting as a blockade at the exit fitted its purpose. After all, a barrage of 8mm bullets blessed by the lord would send any escaping heretic into the afterlife.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Between this collusion of ancient gods and mortals, there are also twisted items, forbidden heirs, and remnants of taint left from ancient times lurking in the depths of the city-state, always trying to move, always trying to pry the order of society apart.Of all these threats, the Sun God\u2019s followers were the ones who most alarmed and troubled the protectors of Pland.They are not only cultists that randomly gathered together but the product of the lost history from the old world. Worst of all, these heretics had a structured \u201cfaith\u201d in place, like the Church of the Deep Sea that Vanna was a part of.This faith revolves around the \u201cEra of Order\u201d under the old sun, which was not only self-contained but even had a corresponding \u201ctrue solar calendar\u201d. Of course, the calendar wasn\u2019t recognized by modern society. To these heretics, they are the descendants of an ancient civilization that has long been lost, and believe that the glorious ancient civilization will be revived one day.As the Inquisitor of the Deep Sea Church, Vanna was not interested in the heresies of the cultists, but she wouldn\u2019t ignore how stubborn and unified the followers of the Sun God were in their goals. The fact that they could survive one blow after another over countless years told the threat they posed to the city.But their resurgence in Pland still surprised Vanna.Since that unprecedented blow four years earlier, the Sun God believers here had been so badly wounded that, according to several investigations, the heretics must have moved their main members to the nearby island cities. Some are even believed to have moved farther north to the Frost Port city-state, leaving only the stubborn few basically unqualified to be in the inner circle of the cultists.These minions hid in the sewers, relying entirely on their knowledge of the underworld and the little twisted blessing given to them by the Black Sun to evade the guardians. For four years, their numbers got smaller and smaller, and all they could do was cling to what little they had to survive.But now, four years later, they suddenly gathered again and even dared to risk exposure to hold a sacrifice ceremony in the assembly hall\u2026 Who gave them the guts?Or rather\u2026 was something big going to happen in this city-state? What reason could be worth it for these heretics to risk being snuffed out for good?The vibration and noise of the steam core running in the mechanical spider\u2019s body eventually forced Vannna to put the wild thoughts away for now. The task force had just entered the industrial zone where huge steam and hydrothermal pipes straddled the factory buildings. These were like giant blood vessels, connecting building to building through the sky, a marvel of human ingenuity in this modern age.This picture brought back some bad memories for her though. The weather was similar to this one all those years ago \u2013 quiet with a slight breeze. It should\u2019ve been peaceful for the slumbering residents of the city. Yet, it was a bloodied night, a nightmare. Her uncle had escaped from the fire with her on his back, and the streets were filled to the brim with the walking dead. Even now, Vanna would feel sick to the stomach at the disgusting stench of chemical grease oozing from the pipes\u2026Eventually, the flat road had ended and ahead was an abandoned area on the city\u2019s outskirts with potholes and undulating roads. The two mechanical spiders could no longer have it easy by using their wheels and instead stretched out those long spider legs to walk on this uneven path.It didn\u2019t take long for the squad to reach an abandoned sewer entrance where a team of eight had already been on standby. They had cordoned off the nearby area to prevent unrelated personnel from approaching the entrance.Vanna greeted them before following the person in charge of the scene directly into the depths. Once past some winding corridors and grimy paths of filthy goo, Vanna finally arrived at the secret meeting hall where more guardians and priest were already hard at work in purifying the place.From what she saw, a makeshift altar was located in the middle of the assembly hall. The wooden stage seems to have been burned by flames from first glance, and on the high platform, one could see the blasphemous totem erected by the Sun God Cultists \u2013 the totem has been burned by the flames as well, but the basic structure remains intact.At the same time, about a dozen cultists were crouched on the ground with their hands tied. Most of whom were trembling in fear and muttering some blasphemous prayers. But with the ceremonial site destroyed and the Storm Goddess already paying attention to this spot, these heretical prayers held no weight anymore.Then not far from the altar, the remains of the victims found in nearby caves were carefully placed on linen cloths painted with runes. The morticians were examining the condition of each body and doing their job as expected.That leaves the priests from the church itself. These clerics are all currently walking around the altar with incense burners strapped to some copper chains and letting the white smoke wisp into the air that promptly turned an ominous black when drawing near the altar. This process would take away the pollution and slowly erode the grip of the Black Sun little by little.\u201cInquisitor, please come here. This is what we have found,\u201d said the young guardian as he pointed at the corpse closest to the altar. \u201cPlease be careful. The ground here is not very clean.\u201dVanna walked straight to the corpses, and after seeing the situation of one of them, she subconsciously frowned.It was a cultist with a golden mask\u2014no doubt the priest directly in charge of the sacrificial ritual on the blasphemous altar.There\u2019s a terrible hole in his chest.\u201c\u2026\u2026 What\u2019s going on?\u201d Vanna frowned even harder, \u201cDid this fanatic get too excited at the end of the ceremony and sacrifice himself? I hadn\u2019t heard of cultists who worshipped the Black Sun doing such a custom.\u201d\u201cThis is exactly what is strange and bizarre about this \u2013 he did not sacrifice himself,\u201d said the guardian who brought Vanna over. Shaking his head with a slightly odd expression on his face, \u201cAccording to the description of the cultists caught at the scene\u2026 their \u2019emissary\u2019 was sacrificed by a sacrifice\u2026\u201d\u201cSacrificed by a sacrifice?\u201d Vanna suddenly raised an eyebrow, \u201cWhat is this crazy talk?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s indeed very much like crazy talk,\u201d the guardian spread his hands helplessly, \u201cin fact, by the time we arrived, most of the cultists here were already in a semi-mad state.\u201d\u201cAlready in a semi-mad state?\u201d\u201cYes, their sacrificial rituals obviously went terribly wrong. Many of them were infected with madness, and most had even begun to slash and kill each other. They all seemed to think of each other as if they were\u2026 some kind of \u2018monster\u2019 occupied by a terrible existence. It\u2019s their frantic frenzy that alarmed the watchmen patrolling nearby, resulting in the exposure of this site\u2026 There were only a few left who could soberly answer our questions when we apprehended them. The ones that did insisted that the emissary had been sacrificed.\u201d\u201cCaught in the madness? Hacking and killing each other? And think others are occupied monsters?\u201d Vanna\u2019s expression immediately became serious, \u201cHave you checked? Is it the result of being polluted by the black sun?\u201d\u201cThere is no trace of outside contamination, but rather a spontaneous madness\u2014the factors that caused the madness are rooted in their own mental world,\u201d said the guardian. Then he raised his finger to a young lady in a long black dress walking among the cultists, \u201cMs. Heidi has arrived. If it is confirmed that these cultists are not contaminated by the black sun, we can only think of a way to resolve the issue using hypnosis.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It also helped that she had tied her long black hair into a bun to appear older. Then matching with that pale blue crystal earing, this young lady was what you call a seductress in a brothel. Truly a fine female specimen that oozed allure.\u201cHeidi also came\u2026 Did city hall send her?\u201d Vanna asked the young guardian beside her.\u201cNo, Ms. Heidi was right here when it happened, so she came straight over when she heard the news. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s nothing. Heidi may be an employee of city hall, but she also has a long-term cooperative relationship with the church. Make sure to register her as a person on site afterward.\u201d Vanna shook her head and quickly refocused her attention on the matter at hand. Asking casually while examining the cult priest who had lost his heart, \u201cWhat else do these cultists have to say? What was the situation at that time?\u201d\u201cTheir language was confusing to piece together, but we did get two members of the cult mentioning the normal ritual had ended when they caught an escaped prisoner. So, the emissary decided to make an exception and performed a second ritual for the sacrifice\u2026.\u201d The guardian said as he recalled, \u201cThe two cultists were standing further away from the altar so the specifics are unknown. They only said that the sacrifice had its heart pierced but didn\u2019t die, that it turned things around and designated the priest as the sacrifice by shouting the sun god\u2019s name\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 A person who was selected as a sacrifice turned the ritual around and sacrificed the presiding assailant?\u201d Vanna showed a face as if she had heard an absurd story. Nevertheless, she restrained her urge to lash out knowing these subordinates were absolutely loyal to the church. \u201cHow can there be such an outrageous thing? If that\u2019s the case, wouldn\u2019t it mean the one with the faster mouth can dictate who gets to be sacrificed during the ritual? It doesn\u2019t make sense at all.\u201d\u201cI agree it doesn\u2019t make sense. The presiding priest occupies a dominant position during the ceremony. There\u2019s no way a weak and ordinary person can overcome their captors under such circumstances with only a sentence. Moreover, through our examination of the priest here, this individual has been eroded by the \u2018depths\u2019, a real \u2018baptized\u2019 person. Also, according to the other cultists, he was still holding the blessed ritual dagger in his hand when he died\u2026.\u201dThe young guardian shook his head as he spoke before moving over to the corpse next to himself.\u201cBut\u2026 look at this, this is the \u2018sacrifice\u2019 that \u2018killed\u2019 the priest.\u201dVanna glanced over to the indicated corpse, which had been entirely devoid of life for a while based on the level of decay. However, it\u2019s precisely this level of decay that caused her eyes to sharpen.It was a thin young man, too thin to be healthy, but more than that, the gaping hole around the heart area left her on alert.\u201cHe has been sacrificed\u2026\u201d\u201cYes, this is a sacrifice that has already been sacrificed. Judging by the evidence on scene, plus the confessions we gathered, this \u2018sacrifice\u2019 may have lost his life long before he was placed on the stage.\u201d The guardian grew heavier in his voice, \u201cSo\u2026 the real situation at that time was that a moving corpse, in full view of everyone, walked up to this stage and killed the priest in charge.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 Necromancy?\u201d Vanna thought to herself, \u201cNo, the power of the Black Sun has great constraint on necromancers, and the walking dead would never be able to draw close to the totem\u2026. Could an anomaly have controlled this corpse?\u201d\u201cHave you checked the lights around here?\u201d She suddenly raised her head and looked at the guardian beside her, \u201cWithin five hundred meters, is there an underground space that\u2019s completely lightless?\u201d\u201cWe checked, and there was no lightless crypt \u2014 even the cultists knew the dangers of the darkness so they were very cautious in making sure every area had some sort of lighting using torches and lamps. This includes the caves used to discard the bodies.\u201dVanna did speak for a while and instead bent down to examine the corpse further. She had no way to confirm the story of what happened, but she could look for clues of outside forces at work here, which she did by flipping open the body\u2019s eyelids to peer inside using her powers.All of a sudden, a glimmering flash seemed to overtake her sight \u2013 a spark of faint green fire jumped out of that hollow eyeball. Before she could react, the flame had already drifted out into the air and disappeared from existence.Vanna\u2019s eyes flinched out of reflex once she returned to her senses. Then, without hesitation, her hands instantly drew the dagger from the waist and cut down on her index finger that made contact. As a follow-up, she pinned the rune-engraved dagger into the corpse\u2019s forehead and caused the body to burst into flames using her holy power.It took her less than a second to complete all this, and at the moment when the corpse was engulfed in the burning heat, she got up and took two steps back. Then with practiced maneuver, she took the blessed holy oil from her waist, bit off the cork, and poured the oil onto her wounded right hand. The holy oil did its job because the flesh and blood instantly started sizzling with large puffs of white smoke coming off of it.Intense pain seared into the inquisitor\u2019s heart, but Vanna\u2019s face never once waivered as the other guardians promptly drew their weapons and cut off the \u201csacrifice\u2019s\u201d head.They were trained for this stuff. Without delay, the closest threw some kind of potion mixed with seaweed extract and silver powder into the fire that caused a continuous series of explosive flares that brought up the heat. Before everyone knew it, the corpse had incinerated into ash from the chemical explosion.The surrounding officials had also noticed the commotion and drew their rune steel swords and circled around Vanna. Some even had large-caliber revolvers out aimed at the surviving cultists. As for the two priests at the scene, they too brought out a strangely threatening gun of sleek design, albeit smaller than the others, but no less lethal based on the runes inscribed on the surface. It also helped the clerics were chanting the storm goddess\u2019s name and giving off a faint glow with their guns.\u201cInquisitor!\u201d The young guardian with the steel sword rushed up to Vanna, \u201cAre you alright? Just now\u2026\u201d\u201cThere is some power that remains in that \u2018sacrifice.\u2019 It managed to bypass all of my defenses from the goddess.\u201d Vanna raised her right hand and saw her blessing taking effect as the flesh began squirming to regrow itself.\u201cSomething is wrong here. Not only is the Black Sun involved, but another powerful force.\u201d The inquisitor immediately made a judgement on the next course of action, \u201cTransfer all the evidence away and take them to the church. Any further inspection and interrogation will be carried out under strict supervision. Have more priests come here and thoroughly purify this area\u2026 Is there anyone else here aside from us?\u201dA nearby guardian immediately replied, \u201cYes, we have previously rescued a batch of \u2018predetermined sacrifices\u2019 in another cave nearby. They are now temporarily placed in the pipe room next to us.\u201d\u201cTake them to the church as well. Although they\u2019re victims of this, it\u2019s too dangerous to let them go for now. Subject them to strict examination for the next few days before allowing them to go home.\u201d Vanna said quickly before adding like she remembered something, \u201cWhat about Ms. Heidi? Is she okay?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d a calm female voice sounded. It was the \u201cpsychiatrist\u201d in the black dress as she unhurriedly walked over, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I didn\u2019t react in time at all just now. Mind explaining why such a big commotion?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 Like many classic stories, these cultists have provoked something far more evil.\u201d Vanna glanced at the \u201cpsychiatrist\u201d before continuing, \u201cI strongly recommend that you get yourself checked by the church too, and if you want to hypnotize the cultists later, do so only with extra protection\u2026 there is a force here that shouldn\u2019t be, at least a lingering remnant remains\u2026.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

During the process, the \u201cscar\u2019s\u201d position never changed.Is this an indication that the scar up there is not some distant astronomical object? But instead, an \u201cimprinted\u201d illusion projected upwards from the Boundless Sea?Or is it because the planet (if this really is a planet) running in sync with the scar? Or the scar actually moves but only appears stagnant because I\u2019m looking at it with only my eyes?All kinds of conjectures came and went inside his head. Still, Duncan wouldn\u2019t be foolish enough to believe any of his conjectures as fact. Until there\u2019s sufficient evidence and reliable experimental verification, it\u2019s just his own speculation.Then the \u201csun\u201d rose.First, the golden radiance emerged from the sea, followed by the huge luminous structure that gradually surfaced from the water line.The sun rose majestically under the gentle movement of the circling runes, and this majestic process seemed to carry some kind of noise in the air\u2014 it was a low, powerful, echoing murmur inside Duncan\u2019s mind. But when he wanted to concentrate and listen, the sound suddenly vanished.He frowned, somewhat baffled if he had just an auditory hallucination. Yet the memory of the sound was so vivid that he could not deny it.Is that\u2026\u2026 is that the sun\u2019s announcement to the world as it rises? Or is it just one of the many illusions that the Boundless Sea brings?No one could answer Duncan\u2019s doubts, and the vast and Boundless Sea kept all its secrets as always.The dove squatted comfortably on Duncan\u2019s shoulder as usual, and then it stood up very suddenly to flap its wings vigorously. \u201cFrench fries! French fries!\u201dDuncan couldn\u2019t help but laugh as he glanced at this strange dove. For once after their meeting, he found comfort in having such a bird around him because it reminded Zhou Ming of home.\u201cIt\u2019s a pity there are no fries on board,\u201d he casually stroked the dove\u2019s beak before turning for the captain\u2019s quarter, \u201cbut you are right about one thing, we have to get something to eat.\u201dMoments later, the captain of the Vanished had prepared a traditional breakfast suitable for what a ghost ship should expect.Duncan didn\u2019t have a dining table so he converted the mapping table for the task. On the menu tonight was the usual jerky and cheese with water. This had served him well for breakfast, lunch, and dinner in the past few days.Carefully draping a dining napkin around his neck while the goat head sat across from himself, Duncan made sure to do this ritualistically. Of course, let\u2019s not forget Alice, who sat to his left and had come early this morning to greet him. As for Ai, the dove was roosting atop of the table to his right.This arrangement pleasantly pleased Duncan inside despite how adamant he was about being a ghost captain. The goat head represented his evil side, and the dove acted as his knowledge. As for the cursed doll, he would eventually think of something to describe her status here. Regardless, it\u2019s nice having companions for once\u2026.Now that leaves one itsy bitsy problem \u2013 the food on the Vanished.Duncan sighed and stared down at his plate. Unlike in the great pirate movies of Hollywood, the real-life dining experience of a ghost ship could only be described as deplorable.Picking up the cheese with his kitchen knife and cutting it, he nearly puked at the texture of sand grinding against his tongue. Then he poked the dried jerky with his fork, finding it near impossible to chew since it was harder than anything he\u2019s ever eaten.Alice stared at this scene curiously and finally asked, \u201cCaptain, today is the same as yesterday\u2019s meal?\u201d\u201cTomorrow\u2019s too,\u201d Duncan glanced up at the cursed doll, \u201cYou want to try?\u201dAlice thought about it and picked up one of the dried jerky meat. But after a quick chew and some crunching sound, she immediately spat it back out in disgust: \u201cIt\u2019s not delicious at all!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like you can eat it anyways. Do you even have a stomach?\u201d Duncan raised an eyebrow and glanced towards her stomach, \u201cI\u2019m more surprised you actually dared to try the food.\u201dThat said, he stared down at the unappealing food on his plate and grew more depressed.The only edible items that could be found on the ship was this, the taste of the dried meat that\u2019s as tough as firewood with a lot of salt. The cheese was easier to chew, but it fell apart like sand and needed water to rehydrate in his mouth. Of course, he tried boiling the meat and cheese together with water, but none of that helped in the flavor department.The good news was that these foods are not poisonous or mutated in any weird way, but the bad news was that they\u2019re still very much undesirable to eat. In fact, Duncan had every reason to believe this cheese and jerky had an age span far older than himself. For one thing, he never tried a cheese that\u2019s as nasty as eating sand nor a jerky that could be used as a weapon.Sure, he didn\u2019t need to worry about catching scurvy on this ghost ship, but Duncan still wanted to lean on a healthy diet. At the very least, the food being as young as him would work too!It\u2019s then the plan of resupplying the ship and exploring the world resurfaced in his mind again. Sadly, these two goals are not achievable in the near future.Duncan sighed and continued to cut the \u201cfirewood\u201d on his plate using the posture of someone seeking revenge.\u201cInsufficient crystal ore reserve?\u201d Ai suddenly poked her head over and pecked the jerky to make a metallic sound.Pricking an eye up, Duncan glanced at the dove and casually crumbled up a cheese corner and threw it over. With another peck of the beak and a swallow, Ai abruptly went stiff and dropped dead like she\u2019s been poisoned.This clown show lasted for no more than five seconds, but it was this five-second of delay that the dove went crazy over. Flapping her wings wildly, Ai made a jolt for the nearest shelf before speaking in a depraved and outraged voice: \u201cI would rather starve today before eating that\u2026\u201dThat actually hurt a bit since it\u2019s so true. Perhaps the statement offended the goat head, who had remained quiet throughout, but the statue had clearly reached its limit and started making that creaking wood sound.\u201cGo ahead and say it,\u201d Duncan gives in and lifts the ban with his order.\u201cYes Captain,\u201d said the goat head, who finally got to talk from the gag order. \u201cI have wanted to ask this since yesterday. This bird you brought back is called Ai, right? How come I can\u2019t understand what she\u2019s saying? Like that phrase about charging Q coins, what does it mean?\u201dDuncan immediately raised an eyebrow because he didn\u2019t expect the goat head to hold back until now to vent this question. Talk about restraints!\u201cYou don\u2019t have to care; her thinking is weird so there\u2019s no need to understand.\u201d Duncan did not stop the carpentry work in his hand and spelled out the excuse he had made up during the night. \u201cIt seems to communicate with people in a language that only it can understand. If you listen to her more often, it\u2019s possible to make a good guess approximately.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d The goat head pondered the idea, \u201cBut I always feel as if there\u2019s some kind of logic hidden in her words\u2026 It is as if there is a complete, self-consistent set of patterns hidden behind the language\u2026 Did you discover Ai during your walk in the spirit world? Could it be some kind of projection from the depths? You know it too. The deeper you go, the more likely it is to see a projection from some misplaced time and space. This may include some a lost civilization, or a fragment of the future, and even a world entirely somewhere else from our own.\u201dThe cutting work in Duncan\u2019s hand paused for a moment in a magnitude that was imperceptible to the naked eye, and then everything went as usual while he spoke in a flat voice: \u201cThen I pray for you to summarize the logic behind Ai\u2019s language soon.\u201dThe words of the goat head may be a casual guess, but the information revealed in it inevitably made waves in Duncan\u2019s mind!My soul got closer to the depths of this world\u2026 The deeper I go, the more likely I will encounter projections from space and time. Some could even be from different timelines.Duncan didn\u2019t see any \u201cscenery in different timelines\u201d when he spirit walked, but the goat had guessed one part right \u2013 Ai had come from a different place.So\u2026\u2026 did \u201cZhou Ming\u201d of Earth bring this dove into the world, or was she from the deeper parts of this world to begin with like the goat head said?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

That it\u2019s a coincidence that Ai\u2019s hanging around?If going by that logic, wouldn\u2019t the earth words coming off of that beak have nothing to do with \u201cZhou Ming\u201d of Earth, but a projection of the history from this world itself?The possibility behind this theory unsettled Duncan.\u201cNeed me to wash the dishes?\u201d Interrupting his train process was Alice, who had gotten up after breakfast. Scratching her hair in an embarrassed manner: \u201cI think I should find something to do since I\u2019m aboard the ship now; otherwise, I will feel like a freeloader\u2026.\u201d\u201cBut you don\u2019t eat at all,\u201d Duncan reminded her, \u201cit\u2019s good that you have that in mind though. Take the dishes to the water room and discuss it with the sink. If it doesn\u2019t mind, you can go ahead and wash the dishes.\u201dAfter saying this, he stood up without waiting for Alice to answer. Then commenting before heading outside: \u201cI will go and inspect the deck. If there is nothing else, do not disturb me.\u201dThe dove strolling about on the shelves flew over to Duncan\u2019s shoulders then and left the room as well, leaving Alice at the mapping table with the goat head staring back.\u201cIsn\u2019t the captain in a good mood?\u201d After a moment\u2019s hesitation, Alice carefully asked the statue.The goat head replied in a deep voice: \u201cThe captain\u2019s mood is like the weather of the Boundless Sea, don\u2019t speculate, just accept.\u201dWithout waiting for the goat head to go on his run-on speech, Alice quickly continued, \u201cBy the way, just now, the captain said to discuss it with the sink\u2026 How do I ask?\u201d\u201cSimple, you go wash things, and if you get splashed with water, it means that the sink doesn\u2019t like you. Speaking of which, do you know how to wash dishes? If not, I have some theoretical experience\u2026\u201dBefore letting things get out of hand, Alice quickly packed up the tableware on the table and rushed out the door while shouting: \u201cNo need, I will learn on my own. Thank you, Mr. Goathead! Goodbye!\u201dSilence returned to the captain\u2019s room, leaving only the black goat head on the table staring blankly in the direction of where everyone ran off to.\u201cHow good it is to have legs\u2026.\u201d The statue sighs at his own misfortune.Then its gaze returned to the chart at hand, where the fog around the Vanished was still dispersing steadily. He\u2019s been charged with the helm by the captain, and the goat head had every intention not to fail.Under the precise control of the driver, the large and \u201cliving\u201d ghost ship deftly adjusted the angle of each sail as it loafed along the waters. During this, the goat head never once stopped humming his pirate tune:Raise the sails, raise the sails, our sailor ye be leaving home.Wind, waves, from death we be only a plank awhey.Toss those anglers, widen the masts, tie the ropes, ahoy thay ship! We be coming for yer treasure!Stay away from the fish, farther away from thy fangs, us sailors want to live!Stay away from ye mers, further away we sail! Peace to our souls!Meanwhile, Duncan had circled around the supply room and kitchen again before finally coming up to the middle portion of the ship.No matter how many times he rummaged through the storehouse, the ship didn\u2019t offer anything more than the cheese and jerky.The good news was that he didn\u2019t have to eat maggot-infested biscuits like the sailors from those medieval era stories. The bad news was that there weren\u2019t even maggots on this ghost ship to begin with.Putting aside his previous wild thoughts for the time being, he took the quiet Ai to the edge of the deck and peered out at the Boundless Ocean.\u201c\u2026\u2026 No matter what, I need to find a way to replenish the necessities on the Vanished\u2026 Although I can\u2019t put too much attention to the quality of life on a ghost ship, I still can\u2019t allow myself to devolve into the barbarism of a ghost\u2026.\u201d\u201cAlice may also need to change her clothes at some point, and there is no suitable dress for that need aside from rags in the cabin.\u201d\u201cAnd the Vanished has drifted on this water for far too long. Things could\u2019ve advanced beyond what the goat head knows about the people on land. Like those revolver guns used by the cultists from the underground sewer, that alone is enough to tell the world is a developing and advanced one\u2026\u201d\u201cIt may be true a century ago this ancient ship might\u2019ve been invincible, but who knows what could\u2019ve changed. Perhaps, the only advantage the Vanished has now was its reputation, and reputation doesn\u2019t solve problems when in naval combat\u2026.\u201dThen glancing at the dove on his shoulder.Maybe\u2026\u2026 if I rest a little today, we can try another \u201cspirit walk\u201d.\u201cGoogoo?\u201d Ai tilted her head and finally came up with some noise that a normal dove should have.Smiling at this behavior, Duncan suddenly noticed an afterglow from the corner of his eyes. Drawn by the movement, he subconsciously glanced downwards to see what was swimming below in the water.After a moment of disbelief, the guy facepalmed his own face in realization.\u201cMy god! How can I be so slow\u2026 this is the sea! There are fishes in the water!\u201dThe sudden \u201cpossibilities\u201d of what this implied sent Duncan\u2019s mood up into the mountains. Establishing contact with land and resupplying the ship couldn\u2019t be done in a single day, but fishing could!He\u2019s fed up with the jerky and cheese!With enthusiasm at an all-time high, Duncan remembered the heavy fishing rod in the storage unit below deck. As for the bait\u2026 would the jerky and cheese work?Just like that, everyone aboard had found a job they could do: the cursed doll was washing dishes, the blabbing-mouthed goat head concentrated on driving the ship, and the captain of the Vanished was busy running between the cabin and deck.It didn\u2019t take long for Duncan to return with three heavy-looking fishing rods and some \u201cbait\u201d from the food inventory. Amateurishly fixing the things to the side of the ship, he quickly tied the bait to the hook and tossed the line overboard. He also moved an empty bucket over to serve as a chair while waiting.Truthfully, Duncan actually had no experience in fishing at sea \u2013 though he did have limited experience doing so at a pond in his hometown. But no matter, the guy\u2019s got plenty of time to learn anyways. What if he succeeds, right?It\u2019s a good way to rest before the next spirit walk, and a chance to improve upon the ship\u2019s food shortage, a win-win outcome.Slowly but gradually, Duncan\u2019s mood returned to normal as he waited for the fish to bite. It does get boring just waiting, especially when the weather shows no signs of a storm coming.Before the guy knew it, he had fallen into a half-dreaming and half-awake state.Inside his dream, Duncan was barefooted on the calm seawater with a burning warm sun hanging in the sky. Naturally, this familiar sun was the \u201cnormal\u201d sun in his memories.Then his attention was caught by the splashing sound of water nearby. It was a flock of little golden fishes about the size of his palm, each spitting bubbles into the air and wagging their tails as if they were swimming in the water despite not.They had circled him to give Zhou Ming a perfect view: those big bulging eyes, fine scales reflecting a wavy pattern, and the opening and closing of their mouths. All he had to say was that they\u2019re beautiful and\u2026. very yummy.Yes, they must be very, very yummy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

With his eyes shot open, the guy found himself glancing back and forth around the deck. As for the fishes in his dream, he could hardly remember their faces, only a faint thin silhouette and how delicious they must be.Do\u2026 fishes swim in the air?Duncan blinked in thought. He\u2019s got this strange sense of reality briefly intermingling with his own fantasies there. Then as soon as he saw the fishing rods with no sign of landing a hook, he deflated, realizing what had happened.Immediately, he peered out into the sea to see what had awoken him. The waves were getting bigger, and the weather had deteriorated to the point where a storm had started brewing overhead.\u201cIt might not be a good idea to fish today\u2026\u201dHe muttered, considering whether it was time to put away the fishing rod. However, it\u2019s at this moment an afterglow caught the corner of his eye \u2013 one of the rods had started to bend!Any fisherman would know what this signaled. The grinding sound of tension, the screeching noise of wire being tugged at, it\u2019s all for this moment!The fish is here, and it\u2019s a big one!He instantly dismissed the idea of pulling the rods off and resting \u2013 the enthusiasm of a fisherman burned was on fire! Grabbing the tugging rod with both hands, he made sure to lean hard against the sides to avoid falling off.\u201cDidn\u2019t I say it! How can I come back empty-handed!\u201dDuncan yelled with excited glee as he mustered the energy to fight this massive prey. It was a difficult fight. Every pull he did got returned with a tremendous tug. No matter how one looked at it, it would appear the guy was losing the fight.Eventually, after much frustration and the line near snapping, this ghost captain finally came up with an idea. Huffing steam of pure ego from his nostril, he summons a plume of green fire on his hands that quickly expanded to infect the fishing rod.The green fire burned violently there, shooting forth from the line until it was dead into the water. Before he knew it, his eyes had caught onto what\u2019s biting \u2013 it\u2019s an illusory green silhouette circling around the ship below the waters!This shadow looked more like a swollen and contracting ball of flesh than a fish from above, almost covering the entire sea surface within a few hundred meters around the Vanished. Nevertheless, Duncan didn\u2019t have the attention to care about some unknown shadow inside the ocean.He\u2019s pulling vigorously and pumping his feet against the side of the deck to give himself maximum leverage.Eventually, the anticipated moment had come. He could clearly feel the tension loosening around the rod, meaning the \u201cprey\u201d had grown tired and it\u2019s his time to strokeIt won\u2019t be long now\u2026.\u2026\u2026Alice was startled by the roar and commotion coming from outside the cabin. Due to the violent fight between man and fish, the entire vessel shook vehemently with the furniture clanging and crashing around. Thankfully the doll had hands, which she used to grab onto the nearby railings for support.\u201cWhat happened?\u201dInitially, Alice assumed the clanging and banging was from the collision just now, but that soon changed when she realized the noise actually came from the items themselves \u2013 they were communicating with each other. Sadly, the doll couldn\u2019t understand the language.All she knew was that something might be wrong outside.Without delay, Miss Doll decided to go up to the deck and have a look. Through much stumbling and a close encounter with a rampaging barrel that rolled across the corridor, she finally came to the end of the stairs and pushed open the door.Huge waves were battering the vessel\u2026.The sky looked dark, inkish even, and the ominous clouds gave off such a condensed, heavy atmosphere that it\u2019s difficult to look.The doll didn\u2019t know if this weather was typical for the Vanished. All she knew was that if she didn\u2019t find the captain soon, she would regret it. Thankfully, it took little effort to locate Captain Duncan, who was still at the edge of the deck.\u2026\u2026The bad weather of wind and battering waves was certainly a pesky thing, but Duncan \u2013 who was about to succeed \u2013 only found it trivial and annoying. He\u2019s now using the ghost fire, and through the feedback from the rod, his prey has stopped resisting. Just a little more, a bit more, and he would drag this catch right out of the water!\u201cCome on you!\u201d He shouted happily.With another hard pull, a giant fish half the size of him directly plopped onto the deck, flailing and splashing about on the wooden vessel. However, instead of joy, he only felt distress at what he saw.\u201c\u2026\u2026 It\u2019s so ugly.\u201dThe big game of a fish indeed had an ugly appearance. Instead of a smooth, sleek body, it had rough and bumpy skin with fins that were so sharp and spread out that its borderline menacing. Then there were those eyes. Instead of a clean pair of sockets, those are white hollow-looking things that would usually be reserved for ghouls and zombies in a horror flick.God knows why, but Duncan got this very uncomfortable sensation that it\u2019s glaring at him, telling the man who dared to fish him to try it.But the next second, the fish convulsed violently, and its eyes that were watching him burst apart with blood gushing in all directions. Then it was dead. No more jumping or flapping around like it\u2019s been tasered. The ugly atrocity had quieted down with only the pool of blood signaling it was alive seconds ago.Duncan got taken aback by this twist of event. Then to his surprise came acceptance over what he remembered: most fishes from the deep are incapable of surviving on the surface due to the water pressure. If hooked, their blood vessels would burst like now and quickly die, which explains what he just saw.Just as he was dazing around still, a crackling sound suddenly caught his ears again. Looking over curiously at what it could be, the man was caught off guard by the smaller \u201cstrange fishes\u201d landing on his ship!They looked exactly like the behemoth, but just smaller about half a meter in size. And like the big game, they\u2019re all bleed profusely from the eye sockets and about to kick the bucket.Dumbfounded, he took a good moment to react: \u201cJeezes, buy one get a dozen?\u201d\u2026\u2026Meanwhile, from Alice\u2019s perspective, the doll was staring nervously at the ferocious fight that just transpired before her very eyes.First, it was how Captain Duncan stood at the edge of the deck, staring down at whatever massive shadow lurking within the waters. Then a tentacle \u2013 thicker than the main mast of the Vanished \u2013 had sprung out of the water. It barred countless menacing eyes across the body, and innumerable sharp teethes next to the eyeballs. At that moment, Alice thought for sure the whole ship would be torn to pieces by the main body beneath the waters.In her panic, she gasped and wanted to cry out for Duncan to dodge. But before she could act, the tentacle had already started smashing down.Yet, instead of panic or rage, Captain Duncan only smiled gleefully like a fisherman about to make a grand harvest, and that\u2019s when their gazes met. The monster tentacle and Duncan were staring off at each other like two predators challenging for supremacy.Then beyond the doll\u2019s expectation, the eyes on the tentacles all burst apart with blood spraying everywhere on the ocean, followed closely by the thrashing and flailing of the monster in the depths.Whatever Duncan did, it was hurting the dark creature hiding in the water because it had cut off its own appendages. Next second later, the filthy and vile thing had crashed onto the wooden deck and rolled in front of the captain\u2019s feet.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

At the same time, the behemoth coiled under the water before diving and disappearing entirely from the Vanished\u2019s view. From how fast it moved, one might even suspect it was fleeing from them.Then the doll glanced upwards and found the thick gloomy clouds that had covered the sky dissipating at speed so fast that it was abnormal. However, that\u2019s not the most important, but rather the shape it appeared as. Just like the shadow lurking in the water, it clearly looked similar, if not a projection of that creature.But the wandering thoughts soon got interrupted by the crackling sound of flames coming from the edge of the deck. Turning to face that direction, the captain in question had returned to his usual appearance of pleasantry instead of that burning pyre of green. He\u2019s beckoning her to come over with a wave of the hand.\u201cLook, I caught a big fish!\u201d Duncan kicked the now lifeless ugly creature on his deck with a rosy grin.\u201cBig\u2026 Big fish?\u201d Alice sluggishly replied as she glanced down at the lump of flesh and bloodied eyes on the floorboard.No matter how she tried to match the idea of a fish to this thing, it simply didn\u2019t add up with those sharp, glowering teethes and menacing eyeballs. Worst of all, the kick indirectly made half of those eyeballs blink, which freaked the daylights out of the doll.\u201cYes, big fish,\u201d said Duncan cheerfully as he pranced like a child, \u201cyou see, it took a lot out of me to get this thing aboard.\u201dAlthough she was only a puppet, Alice still felt as if there were \u201cmuscles\u201d in the corners of her eyes that shuddered over what she just heard. Her mouth moved in an attempt to object, but she simply didn\u2019t know how to correct the captain on this topic regarding that \u201cfish\u201d at Duncan\u2019s feet.Sure, it\u2019s taking the shape of a fish now after being cut off, but the blackish-grey potholed skin was still gross.There are also the many \u201clittle fishes\u201d scattered around the deck.Alice lost all expressions for words as she stared wide-eyed at the scene. Miss Doll here didn\u2019t have much experience in life so she didn\u2019t understand what \u201cdoubting life\u201d meant, but if she did, this would surely fit that description. From a monster\u2019s tentacle transforming into a bunch of fishes, everything about this was wrong!Perhaps her momentary sluggishness was too obvious because Duncan immediately noticed Alice\u2019s abnormality. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d Alice opened her mouth, but just as she was about to say something, the sudden recollection of the goat head\u2019s rules came up.On the Vanished, Captain Duncan holds absolute authority, and his words are absolute \u201cfacts\u201d \u2014 if the real world contradicts Captain Duncan\u2019s words, then the captain\u2019s judgment will prevail.\u201cNo problem!\u201d Alice swiftly changed her overly antsy tune and swapped topics, \u201cBy the way Captain, that storm just now was terrifying\u2026\u201d\u201cStorm? You say that wave?\u201d Duncan looked doubtful at Miss Doll, \u201cThat wave is indeed quite big, but far from being called a storm\u2026 but then again, have you ever seen a storm before?\u201dAlice: \u201c\u2026 You\u2019re right.\u201dIf Captain Duncan called the storm that covered almost the entire sea a \u201cwave,\u201d then it must be a wave. If he called a giant tentacle with eyes and fangs a \u201cfish,\u201d then it must also be a fish. It doesn\u2019t matter what she saw or thought.\u201c\u2026\u2026 I get the feeling you\u2019re a little nervous right now. Are you okay?\u201d Duncan still sensed something was wrong in Alice\u2019s tone and grew more worried about her, \u201cIs it seasickness? But do you even get seasick?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine. Just now the ship shook a little\u2026\u201d Alice looked at the captain in front of her with a concerned expression. She didn\u2019t know whether to feel at ease or more afraid toward this man, \u201cBy the way, these\u2026 what are you going to do with these \u2018fishes\u2019?\u201d\u201cDoes this still need to be asked?\u201d Duncan burst out laughing, \u201cOf course I\u2019m going to eat them!\u201dAlice\u2019s expression became momentarily stunned: \u201c\u2026 Eat?\u201d\u201cWhat else? Didn\u2019t you find the food stock on the Vanished too bland?\u201d Duncan obviously sounded pleased with himself, \u201cI\u2019m going to fillet one right away. We can stew, grill, or even dry the smaller ones with salt\u2026.\u201dHe happily went over his plan for the \u201cfishes\u201d. Although he had a confident attitude with that tongue, but in truth, the guy had no idea if he would succeed in his culinary skills. For one thing, he\u2019s been an instant noodle user all his life. Asking a guy like that to cook something of such high skill was asking a lot.But there\u2019s no way to know unless he tries, right? So long as it doesn\u2019t make his stomach churn, anything goes.No matter how happy Duncan was at landing a catch, he still retained some semblance of sanity. After all, a fish that ugly would give anyone the idea of it being poisonous. The safe route would be to find a hapless egg to try it first.Of all the candidates, his first thought was about the goat head in the captain\u2019s quarter. Sadly, he ruled out that option right away. Then he glanced over to the cursed doll opposite to him. Alice wasn\u2019t feasible either since she had no stomach.Finally, his eyes fell upon the dove on his shoulder, which got returned with a tilt of her head.Ai didn\u2019t look like a normal creature at all, but if there\u2019s going to be a crewmember with flesh and blood on this ship, it looks like she\u2019s the only one left.Moments later, Duncan left the deck with his \u201charvest\u201d\u2014lunchtime approached, and he couldn\u2019t wait to improve the food quality on the vanished.It took a moment, but Alice eventually followed along to the captain\u2019s quarter. She hadn\u2019t intended to come looking for the goat head so soon after experiencing the first mate\u2019s nagging skills. If possible, she did not want to go in there again.But what had happened today was so strange that she felt compelled to consult with the experienced Mr. Goathead if this was a normal phenomenon on the Vanished.She did not violate the crew code. Inquiring about the situation shouldn\u2019t be taboo.After hesitating for a full ten seconds, Alice finally plucked up the courage to push open the door of the captain\u2019s quarter.The next second, she was shocked to see that the goat head had already turned in the direction of the doorway and was staring hard at her like he\u2019s been waiting.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on outside?\u201d The goat head opened its mouth in a highly concise manner.Alice sensed something was wrong with the other\u2019s perverse behavior. Quickly closing the door reflexively, she came up to the mapping table and reviewed everything she saw. Once done, an extremely uncomfortable and eerie silence fell upon the room.Despite the wooden statue not being able to make an expression, Alice could clearly tell the situation had gone beyond the control of the \u201cfirst mate\u201d.Tensing up as she subconsciously leaned forward: \u201cIsn\u2019t this a normal occurrence on the Vanished? Could it be that the captain really\u2026\u201d\u201cEverything is normal for the Vanished,\u201d the goat head finally awoke from the silence and replied. The way he sounded, it was as if the statue had plugged some kind of loophole in its logic. \u201cListen, the Vanished is normal, always normal, and the great Captain Duncan is as always!\u201d\u201cThat\u2026 I only assumed based on your reaction\u2026\u201d\u201cThings are a little beyond my expectations, but this is due to my lack of imagination and knowledge.\u201d The goat\u2019s words quickly flowed with the usual speed of its chattery personality, \u201cYes, the great Captain Duncan\u2014he deserves to be greater and stronger! There\u2019s nothing out of the ordinary, Miss Alice. Listen, it\u2019s business as usual on the Vanished! Let the captain do what he thinks is right and don\u2019t discuss the topic\u2026 Just remember this fact from today onward: There are fishes in the kitchen of the Vanished, and fishes are a delicious ingredient.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Then with some stumble, he splits the fatty body into several pieces, leaving only the head that had no meat to the side.I wonder what others will think if they saw a ghost captain working in the kitchen. Will they be so shocked and faint? Or will they drop their jaws and scream?Duncan came up with these thoughts while splitting the flesh from the bones. It made him chuckle at the silliness but also a motivation for that day to come \u2013 inviting friends over to the ship, sharing a drink on a good afternoon day, and chatting away about various topics without being called a natural disaster. That\u2019s the type of life he wants, not this lifeless solitude by himself.After a simple cleaning of the catch, Duncan temporarily puts most of the fish into a barrel covered with sea salt before pushing the container into the warehouse. As for the remaining smaller fishes, he\u2019s going to process them later by marinating and drying them against the breeze.Unfortunately, no alcoholic spirits were found on the ship; otherwise, the fish could have been handled with more means.It\u2019s certainly a good thing to have fresh fish to eat every day, but Duncan knows that fishing depends on luck. Today\u2019s harvest may be good, but the next time may not \u2013 it\u2019s not like he\u2019s going to know how to process the excess ingredients every time as well.After all, he had no means to verify if the jerky and cheese in the inventory were special, or that the Vanished was doing the preservation with its ability. Also, he\u2019s not going to take a gamble on the hard-earned fishes by letting them go bad. Dried fish still tasted better than jerky and cheese from a century ago.Tossing the most tender pieces of fish into the simmering pot along with a piece of jerky, Duncan\u2019s going to stew this until the meat falls apart.Any real chef would lose their mind by now after witnessing the guy\u2019s sinful creation. The most tender parts of a fish should be moderately fried to bring out its natural flavor \u2013 Duncan knew this as well \u2013 but he had to do this to ensure it was safe to eat.Catching unknown things from the sea carried a risk regardless of the water quality, like parasites for example, or naturally toxic flesh of the fish. By fully cooking it to mush, this risk would be minimized to the lowest. Whether or not a \u201cghost captain\u201d would be affected by these risks was another thing entirely, and he didn\u2019t want to test that water.After almost spending the entire afternoon away, Duncan finally got his belated \u201clunch\u201d ready \u2013 a bowl of fish soup. But before he could poke his fork into the flesh and savor in the flavor, he blew it cold and placed it before Ai the dove.Of course, doves don\u2019t eat meat \u2013 but \u201cAi\u201d could hardly be said to be a normal bird.Duncan needs to satisfy his curiosity, and he has so many things to try on the Vanished.As for what to do if this \u201cabnormal dove\u201d gets poisoned, he also had a plan in mind.First of all, he handled the ingredients as much as possible, and letting Ai try was only a formality. Secondly, if Ai\u2019s situation really does take a turn for the worse, he could immediately use the green fire to pull her back into the spirit form. Once in that state, decomposing her body and reforming it would be simple. In any case, the toxin would have no effect.Ai tilted her head to watch Duncan\u2019s gesture, and after confirming that the piece of fish was for herself, she pecked at the table and then glanced up to the ceiling. \u201cAre your melons ripe?\u201dDuncan: \u201cJust say you will eat it or not.\u201dAi flapped her wings and copied Duncan\u2019s tone, \u201cJust say you will eat it or not!\u201dThen it lowered her head and pecked at the already cold fish. At a surprising speed, she unceremoniously wiped out the food so fast that it\u2019s unsuitable for a bird!After eating, Ai stretched her neck vigorously and then hopped around on the table with a pleasant air: \u201cTasty! Tasty!\u201dDuncan appeared stunned before sighing inwardly over the bird\u2019s behavior.After a while, he relaxed and began to dig into the meal with his pet, and indeed, it\u2019s very tasty as Duncan had imagined.\u2026\u2026As the setting sun draws closer to the walls of the city\u2019s edge, things were as usual with the towering chimneys, pipes, and towers of the City-State of Pland being bathed in the setting golden glow of the evening.There are chimes from the Storm Cathedral, the whistling of steam valves releasing their pressure after the factory closes, and the people returning to their homes to settle for the night. They all know, the exchange of day to night has begun, and the influences of the \u201cdepths\u201d are coming. Thankfully the effects are mitigated if one stayed home end kept to a brightly lit place \u2013 gas lamps blessed by the clergy would effectively dispel the malice lurking in the shadows.In any case, the Holy Storm Cathedra would continue to watch over the city-state of Pland during the time where civilization was at its weakest. Though there\u2019s the occasional anomaly appearing in the city\u2019s premises at times, but those are usually small and harmless problems.Of course, there are always going to be fools who yearn for the darkness even under the watchful eye of the church. These are the idiots of society, the deplorable ones who drove themselves into a frenzy for a \u201cglorious\u201d age that\u2019s to yet to come.Fortunately in the city-states where the forces of order dominate, these subversive individuals often only manages to spend their time curled up in the shadows. Like tonight, in the abandoned sewers of Pland, several figures in black hoods are doing just that \u2013 curling up in the corner of a forgotten room and cursing at their luck.\u201cDamn those church hounds\u2026\u201d A weak and confused-looking thirty-year-old man was lying on the ground with his rags.\u201cWe have lost a large number of our compatriots, and the emissary has died in the ceremony\u2026\u201d said another in a hoarse voice, \u201chow can the sacred ceremony suddenly lose control\u2026\u201d\u201cThat sacrifice\u2026 it\u2019s because of that sacrifice. He is clearly a heretic\u2026\u201d\u201cAll of you listen,\u201d a black-robed suddenly gestured them to shush and cocked his ears up, \u201cit\u2019s the sound of the twilight bell and steam whistle.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 It\u2019s almost night,\u201d the black-robed who was the first to curse said in a low voice before looking at a fellow \u201ccompatriot\u201d who was lying motionless on a sheet. They\u2019re all in pretty bad shape, but one was far worse than the rest, \u201cDamn it\u2026 hopefully he will get through this night.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Then he glanced at the \u201ccompatriot\u201d lying on the ground and saw that the other\u2019s eyes were half open and half closed without any focus.\u201cHe\u2019s only alive for now,\u201d said another cultist in a low voice, \u201cand the twilight bell has rung. He cannot die in this room. The Lord\u2019s patronage will bless him with a peaceful slumber in the darkness.\u201dThe man lying on the sheet twitched his fingers twice over the comment \u2013 obviously aware of his own health condition. He did not want to die like this, but death had already clung onto his shadow, and for the time being, his dear \u201cfellow sunmen\u201d considered him a \u201chidden danger\u201d worthy of removing from the shelter.An extremely oppressive silence hung in the air due to this difficult decision. But after a unknown amount of time, the black-robed man who had cursed the Storm Church before suddenly broke the silence: \u201cLet\u2019s wait a bit. At least\u2026. a person won\u2019t change right away after their breathing stops.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 Then we will wait,\u201d the low-voiced black-robed disciple says after glancing at the struggling, dying sunmen. \u201cBut why did he suddenly fall ill? Are you sure this is normal?\u201d\u201cI know him\u2026 He runs an antique shop in the lower sector of the city. Its only counterfeits though so his business isn\u2019t doing well,\u201d said a believer next to him who had never spoken much. \u201cHe was already sick before this so he\u2019s likely having a relapse from spending so much time with us in the sewers. The shock today is probably what worsened it.\u201dThe black-robed believer with a low voice finally relaxed a little after hearing the explanation. Although he was not a noble \u201cpriest\u201d like the emissary, he did have more experience from being a converted for many years, effectively making him more or less an \u201cexpert\u201d who knew a lot of occult knowledge. Like how there would always be hidden dangers that came with a failed ceremony like today. The only thing he didn\u2019t know was who had become a \u201ccarrier\u201d of said danger.If it weren\u2019t for the restraining notion of \u201call the people of the sun are siblings\u201d \u2013 plus there were still a few fierce believers around him watching \u2013 he would have thrown this unlucky sick guy into the darkness outside already.After a long silence, the black-robed believer suddenly made a move and brought out a pale golden amulet from his pocket. He placed the item onto the chest of the dying \u201ccompatriot\u201d.\u201cYou are\u2026\u201d a believer next to him spoke curiously.\u201cI got this amulet from the Emissary at great cost,\u201d he said in a sincere voice, \u201cmay the shining grace of the Lord protect our siblings and him from the erosion of darkness.\u201dThe two believers next to him immediately applauded. Then with reverence, they started to chant while pumping their fist against the chest: \u201cAll who worship the sun are brothers and sisters\u2026.\u201d\u2026\u2026After the sun had completely fallen below sea level, the starless and moonless sky once again appeared before Duncan. There\u2019s still the pale crack sweeping across the horizon, illuminating the Boundless Sea with its cold glow while the Vanished sail along the ocean.He sighed at this picture while standing at the aft.No matter how many times he searched, he could not find the stars beyond the pale glow.But compared to the last time he saw this starless night though; his mood did feel much better. He\u2019s adapting to life in this strange world, and he\u2019s gotten the pleasure of tasting the delicious fish he caught.As an optimistic man, and any slight improvement in his life was something to be happy about\u2014not to mention that there were more gifts of nature than he had imagined.At this pace, even if he could not establish a stable connection with land in the meantime, he could at least improve the living conditions on this ship.During his musing, he turned to face the dove roosting on his shoulder and casually spoke in a playful voice: \u201cYou say\u2026 wouldn\u2019t it be easier if I did something befitting of a pirate captain? For example, find a busy shipping route and do some piracy\u2026.\u201dThe pigeon tilted its head, and the two beady red eyes browsed around without focus: \u201cDoesn\u2019t sound like it, doesn\u2019t sound like it, doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2026.\u201d\u201cGuess you\u2019re right. It\u2019s not in my character,\u201d Duncan smiled, \u201cand doing it is not as easy as saying it. At the very least, I need to find a shipping route first.\u201dHe had no idea how far the Vanished had drifted from the coasts of the mainland. Sure, they did come across the White Oak carrying Alice before, but Duncan was certain that\u2019s a one-off. There\u2019s no way shipping an anomaly was something of a daily occurrence.Exactly then, a voice suddenly came from the side and interrupted Duncan\u2019s train of thoughts: \u201cCaptain, are we going to pirate other ships?\u201dDuncan followed the sound and was met with Alice sitting on a high plank staring curiously at himself.In the pale and scarred glow of the sky, the Gothic doll in the black dress gave off an air of serene calm found only in those classical paintings of old depicting nobilities.This took Duncan by surprise for a moment. After a few \u201creal-life moments\u201d of hectic running around, he had almost forgotten how elegant this doll could be when idly sitting in one spot. For a second, he was awed by her beauty and air.Alice didn\u2019t know what the captain was thinking of course and asked curiously again, \u201cCaptain, are we going to pirate other ships?\u201dWithout question, this sentence did a lot of damage to her image.\u201cDo you like piracy?\u201d Duncan smirked.\u201cNo,\u201d Alice shook her head, \u201cit sounds boring.\u201d\u201cBut you were \u2018pirated\u2019 by me to get on the ship,\u201d he reminded her.\u201c\u2026\u2026 True,\u201d Alice thought for a moment, nodded, and then asked again, \u201cSo are we going to be pirates now?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Duncan waved his hand and unhurriedly walked toward his personal quarter, \u201cI also find piracy rather uninteresting. Taking a stroll is more suitable as an after-dinner exercise in comparison.\u201dDuncan returned to the captain\u2019s room alone and briefly commanded the goat head to take the helm using his psychic.He had already decided to take a second spirit walk tonight.But unlike the last time, he will test this ability with the dove as company.A cluster of green sparks jumped around Duncan\u2019s fingertips once he summoned the ghost fire. At the same time this occurred, the bird who was wandering around the table disappeared and reappeared around his shoulder.Feeling the kind of connection between Ai and himself, Duncan slowly calmed his breathing and remembered the \u201cfeeling\u201d he had when activating the brass compass \u2013 he was going to communicate with the dove using this method.The ethereal green flame turned into a thin line and wrapped around Ai\u2019s wings following his will, and the next second, the white dove suddenly burst into a ball of fire!The feathers of the white dove turned into her illusory form following the transformation, rising and flapping like a miniature phoenix while constantly forming and reforming without a set body. In the meantime, the compass hanging around Ai\u2019s chest also activated, \u201csnapping\u201d the glass lid open while the pointed dial spun wildly as numerous occult runes shimmered into the air. Then, like the first time, the needle abruptly stopped, pointing straight towards a specific direction.The surrounding scene disintegrated in the next second, and the familiar dark tunneling space appeared in Duncan\u2019s view that was promptly accompanied by the mysterious streams of lights. He needed no instructions, allowing his heart to look for the next \u201ctarget\u201d suitable for contact.Suddenly, his awareness was attracted to one of the clusters of starlight in the distance.He didn\u2019t know if that was the \u201cCaptain Duncan\u2019s intuition\u201d mentioned by the goat head, but he was going to follow that feeling since it felt right. No matter who was behind the starlight, at least for now, the individual has become fated to meet him, the great Captain Duncan.\u2026\u2026In the abandoned sewers on the edge of the city-state of Pland, the sun god cultists who had luckily escaped from the church\u2019s guardians wordlessly rested in their hideout.The above-ground world has fallen into a deep slumber, and the underground world has only a faint cluster of lights sheltering the abandoned. No matter how ferocious and vile they deem to appear on the outside, they\u2019re still human, meaning they\u2019re going to be nervous and terrified by the darkness so long as the sun doesn\u2019t rises.Finally, under this oppressive and difficult mood, the dying companion among their group had breathed his last breath.\u201cMay the sun continue to shine on your soul in the darkness,\u201d said the black-robed disciple with a low voice. Then waving his hand to signal the others, \u201cTake him\u2026\u201dUnfortunately, his words stopped there as he spluttered to gather his wits.In front of everyone\u2019s eyes, the corpse without signs of life began to breathe again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They had no idea the person had actually died already. In their view, the fellow compatriot only looked like he\u2019s passed out for a split second before making a full recovery.\u201cThank you Lord for your protection!\u201d A younger black-robed believer finally reacted and couldn\u2019t help but praise excitedly, \u201cYou survived! I thought you would\u2026\u201d\u201cWait! This isn\u2019t right! Back off!\u201d The low-voiced believer who was most skeptical suddenly raised a hand to halt his brethren to back off. At the same time, he glared daggers at the newly awakened man, \u201cHis breathing clearly stopped for good, I am not mistaken\u2026 something is not right!\u201dDuncan finally adapted to the surrounding environment after the initial daze. He could see the group nearby, and for the first time, he\u2019s thinking WTF due to how familiar the environment was.The spirit world should be random, and when he chose the target, he was completely following his intuition in the chaos. The fact that he ended up in the same place with these cultists are beyond lucky at this point.Then he noticed the strange looks coming his way and the black cloak on himself. After two seconds of silence, he now understood what\u2019s happening.Last time he was sacrificed by the cultists, and now he\u2019s actually a \u201ccultist\u201d.Talk about being fated.\u201c\u2026\u2026 Something is not right!\u201dJust then, a low, hostile voice interrupted Duncan\u2019s chaotic state of mind after \u201cawakening\u201d. Following the noise, he was immediately met with a pair of vigilant eyes gleaming warily at himself.Duncan was stunned over the hostility, then realized he might have possessed a corpse like the last time.Oh wow, I just did an undead rising right in front of these cultists!After connecting the dots, the nervous tension from these black robes made a lot of sense then. Quickly working the brain to come up with an excuse, he was ready to explain when a burst of fragmented memories vaguely surfaced from within. It\u2019s his name, how he joined this cult, and why he drank the blood of the innocent to gain the sun\u2019s blessing\u2026Duncan didn\u2019t know how long he fell into that sluggish state, perhaps for only a second, but he felt sorry for this body\u2019s original owner. No doubt, it\u2019s a hateful yet pitiful life story.Then it dawned on him. Unlike the first spirit walk, he was able to read the life story of whoever he possessed!A new ability? But why? Is it because this corpse is still fresh? Or is it because of Ai\u2019s connection this time?Not dwelling on the discovery, Duncan slowly got up from the floor. He knows, whatever the reason it might be, this was not the time to relish on the issue. There are still the nervous-looking cultists in front of himself that needs handling.With Duncan\u2019s movement to get up, the cultists also backed off with one raising a blade in a defensive position: \u201cDon\u2019t move! Tell me, what is your name?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 Ron,\u201d Duncan replied naturally, \u201cRon Strian.\u201d\u201cHis name is Ron.\u201d A young black-robed believer on the other side immediately confirmed to the leading cultist.However, the wary cultist did not let his guard down and continued to stare daggers at Duncan. Then chanting a spell using a devoted voice: \u201cIn the name of the sun, may the glory of the Lord shine, and in the name of the sun, may the blessings of the Lord come!\u201dListening to the sudden insanity of the cultist on the other side, Duncan just stood there in stunned silence until a burning sensation locked onto his chest. He subconsciously pulled out the thing under his shirt and found it to be a golden talisman of the sun. It\u2019s radiating a strange heat from the surface.Then without warning, the talisman suddenly burst into flames that\u2019s full of malice.\u201cThe glory of the Lord is eating him!\u201d Seeing this scene, the cultist who had just recited the prayer reacted instantly and shouted, \u201cHis soul has been replaced! Kill this heretical filth!\u201dThe other cultists moved noticeably slower, but they did not hesitate to draw the short swords from their waist to attack. \u201cKill him!\u201dWhile Duncan watched the black cultists attack him, another shadow had suddenly appeared in the corner of his eyes. It\u2019s a ghostly green undead bird flapping its wings across the ceiling while emitting a strange scream from its beak.The cultists were naturally attracted by this \u201cundead bird\u201d and looked upwards, but this was a mistake on their part. In real-time, their bodies started to overlap with the shadows, fading and blurring between reality and darkness until they were frozen to the spot.With great horror in their eyes, they watched as the undead bird eventually circled around them to land on Duncan\u2019s shoulder. Then, with even greater shock, the sun amulet \u2013 still burning yellow in the man\u2019s hand \u2013 had snuffed out to be replaced by a ghostly green flame like the undead bird!Pleased by what he\u2019s done, Duncan gradually came up to the frozen cultists and said the most terrifying words possible: \u201cIf only you had pretended not to know anything.\u201dThe next second, the figures of the cultists flashed violently in mid-air like fireworks at a party until they too were gone from existence.\u201cAiya, the page is missing. Try refreshing?\u201d Ai randomly chirps this while still in her ghost form.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

All he knew was that this was Ai\u2019s ability.After a few seconds of confirming that the cultists really couldn\u2019t come back, he turned his head slightly and asked the dove on his shoulder: \u201c\u2026 Where did you send them?\u201dAi flapped her wings \u2013 which had become translucent and ghostly with her beak \u2013 before answering: \u201cThey\u2019ve retreated into the shadows!\u201dDuncan frowned over that. He\u2019s been adapting to Ai\u2019s language and could vaguely guess: \u201c\u2026 You mean, you banished them to some sort of\u2026 parallel space? Or did you turn them into some kind of untouchable state?\u201dThe dove looked up, her eyes fluttering at Duncan all innocently, \u201cGoogoo!\u201dShe\u2019s now pretending to be a real dove again\u2026But no matter, Duncan believes he\u2019s gotten the truth already.First patting the dove on the head, he glances around the dimly lit shelter to see what he has to work with: a square room similar to the sewers he walked through from the first spirit walk, flickering oil lamps against the wall and some sheets on the floor for rest.There are no signs of the sun god cultists around \u2013 they\u2019ve completely disappeared from this world. However, upon further inspection, Duncan felt the hair-raising sensation that they were still around. He couldn\u2019t see or touch them, but the ominous screams of their struggles somehow reverberated in his ears like some phantom cry.Eventually, Duncan was able to confirm his theory. Amid the flickering of the oil lamp on the table, he saw the faint scratch mark of a blade grinding against the wall in the perfect interlacing of light and shadow. But upon blinking his eyes, it\u2019s gone\u2026.This would be the last contact the cultists here would ever have with the real world. Whatever or wherever they were sent off to, they are not coming back.Heaving a long sigh over this, Duncan didn\u2019t comment and turned to leave after knowing what he\u2019s done.Outside the abandoned hideout, there was a much narrower corridor than the sewer tunnels he\u2019s been in before \u2013 it\u2019s a forked path, one going deeper underground and another upwards.Going by what he knew, Duncan briefly judged the path going upwards led to the surface based on his fragmented memories. There\u2019s no need to hesitate. He wants to explore this world and the surface.Soon, fresh air currents hit his hair, followed by the vague rumbling of factories in the distance on his ears. He could also hear the faint sound of waves crashing against the reefs, which made him trot the last stretch of the way due to excitement.\u201cThe era is calling! Era is calling!\u201d Ai flaps her wings and transforms back into her regular form with a happy chirp.Pausing his feet, Duncan stared at the dove after remembering something: \u201cDon\u2019t talk casually outside anymore. Doves don\u2019t speak human language.\u201dAi thought for a moment and flapped her wings vigorously, \u201cAye, captain!\u201dDuncan was surprised by how proper the reply was. He didn\u2019t know if it was a coincidence or deliberate, but he quickly left it behind to move on.There\u2019s a whole new world awaiting him after all!But before then, he must ditch the black robe on his body. Wearing such attire out into the public street would draw the attention of all the policing officials.Secondly, he must also be out of sight from the night watchmen. Pland had a strong curfew in place. If citizens wish to walk outside during the night, they must be equipped with a legal document permitting them to do so. Since this body was a formal cultist, he clearly didn\u2019t have such a document.Duncan quickly sorted through the fragments in his mind, most of which were messy and vague because they were inherited from a corpse. Nevertheless, he got enough information to have a vague idea of what he needed to do next.He first took off his robe before reaching the final exit \u2013 underneath were the regular clothes so it wouldn\u2019t arouse suspicion. Of course, Duncan considered burning the robe on the ground too, but the flames would surely attract attention from the smoke. In the end, he rolled it up and hid it in a corner and out of sight.The Sun Amulet he\u2019s holding was also something that could cause trouble, but the potential this item carried was too valuable for Duncan to discard. He must return to the Vanished with this and do further testing and studying.Once he\u2019s done all this and cleaned up his appearance \u2013 no longer looking like a frantic and fleeing cultist \u2013 Duncan finally made the final stretch up the tunnel.Solid, stable, bathed in pale shimmering, these were the first impression he had of the earth beneath his feet.Then Duncan\u2019s eyes stretched wide after catching his first glimpse of the city proper. It\u2019s just like he had imagined. Buildings and infrastructure, as far as the eye could see, this was the representation of human civilization!Duncan burst out laughing using a silent voice that left him gasping for air.But after a moment, he forcibly stopped the crazed laugh and began walking. This was not the place to stand idle.Cultists also have their own \u201cnormal lives\u201d. Except for a few \u201cpriests\u201d who completely took up the mantle of being a scourge upon civilization, most are merely people who got deceived from the onset. Like single elderly individuals without families, impoverished lower-class citizens, or the young who have never experienced life yet, these are all prime targets for the cultists to recruit.As for the corpse possessed by Duncan here, the poor fellow by the name of Ron, was an ordinary man who owned an antique shop in the lower sector of the city. Through misfortune and fate, Ron found himself diagnosed with a lethal illness, hence the eventual fall into darkness.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The sun was still out, and the Creation of the World continued to shine down with its pale white glow through her windowsill, giving the night a peaceful and serene appearance.Nevertheless, Vanna just couldn\u2019t shirk away the grotesque image from her mind \u2013 a great ship howling with the desolate cries of the damned while wanting to crush Pland with its gigantic flaming presence.At the same time as the ship descended, she also saw a blazing sun rising from the city\u2019s depths \u2013 not the rune-bound sun known to the world \u2013 but the celestial star body described by those sun heretics hiding in the sewers.During that purgatory dream, the Church of the Storm remained motionlessly to one side as it watched the catastrophe claim her home. No guidance came for her believers, only meaningless bells and prayers that went unanswered\u2026.Vanna quietly sat up from the bed and came to the window in her pajamas. She stared down at the city structures and saw nothing but calm and serenity for this night. Yet, the unease and irritation only grew as she knew it was not true.Moments later, the young inquisitor retracted her gaze and came before the dresser. Inside one of the drawers was the curved ritual dagger of her faith representing the Storm Goddess.Vanna\u2019s gaze lingered on the blade for several more seconds until she couldn\u2019t hold back anymore. First cutting a tiny line on her fingertip, she allowed a droplet of blood to ooze forward before chanting the Storm Goddess\u2019s name to seek guidance.However, for some reason, she only heard some illusory waves roaring in her ear. The \u201cpsychic induction\u201d that she could so easily tap into in the past wasn\u2019t answering her today. It\u2019s as if a huge invisible curtain had suddenly cut her off from the Storm Goddess.Vanna\u2019s brow furrowed a little over this disconnect.The disturbance of the connection between believers and gods was rare but not unheard of since the relationship between subspace and the real world was a complex balance. But the storm goddess Gemona\u2026 should\u2019ve been the one exception due to the Boundless Sea.This was one of the reasons why the Storm Church could become the strongest religion in this world.Can the problem be with me?Vanna naturally began to doubt her own state, but when she glanced down at her fingertip, the wound she had cut had already healed. This proved the blessing she got from the Storm Goddess remains.There must be a correlation between my dream and my failure to hear the goddess\u2019s voice.A ghost ship burning with green flames\u2026 ghost ship\u2026Vanna\u2019s mind quickly recalled and compared the occult knowledge she had mastered, and then her eyes suddenly became serious.She was no expert in the field of sea navigation and had little contact with the absurd, superstitious myths circulating among superstitious sailors, but even in orthodox ecclesiastical texts, there was a ghost ship that occupied a special place.It was an ominous ship returning from subspace, and its captain was the terrifying man who caused the thirteen islands of Wetherland to be swallowed up by the border collapse a century ago, Duncan of the Vanished.Vanna hurriedly got up from the dresser and wanted to confirm her suspicion, but then she remembered the hour was late and the cathedral\u2019s archive wouldn\u2019t open to anyone at night.And from a perspective of security, she had best not discuss the details of the dream with others only a few hours after its occurrence. After all, it only takes that much to create a connection with the \u201cCaptain Duncan\u201d and allow an opening for him to return from subspace.The most consistent and safe way would be to wait patiently. Once the sun rises and regains its dominant place in the world, any connection established by the dream would wain and dissipate. From that point onward, she would consult the relevant information in the archives or seek the church\u2019s archbishop for advice.In any case, she must do all that she could to stop that legendary ship from making landfall on Pland. As its protector and citizen, Vanna had every duty to do so.\u2026\u2026A tall, thin black figure quickly swept through the deserted streets of the downtown area and left only a brief glimpse of his shadowy silhouette behind.These are unfamiliar buildings and streets, but through the memories, he \u201cdevoured\u201d from possessing this body, Duncan knew exactly where to go.This made him very happy because he finally succeeded. Not only did he make landfall, but the guy also got plenty of information regarding this world\u2019s technology using this complete disguise instead of a rotting corpse.Frankly speaking though, the health of this body was actually not very good. Thankfully the ability of spirit walk allowed him to ignore the state of the body so he had no complaints.The distant bark of dogs from the end of the alley eventually caused Duncan to stop running, forcing him to hide between the cracks of the two nearest buildings.He didn\u2019t know if these were patrol dogs led by the church night watchmen, but it\u2019s better to be safe than sorry.Eventually, the noise died again as the steampipes quietly whistled its exhaust into the night.Duncan stepped out of his hiding place and carefully observed the streets for any hidden dangers. Then through his memory, he kept to the left side knowing the house to the right tended to rouse attention due to its occupants being drunks.Between a row of low, two- or three-story buildings, he eventually arrived at a shabby old building with a dirty sign hanging on its front. This building had clearly been mishandled because the window was filthy dirty \u2013 barely able to peek inside due to the grime \u2013 but it was home nevertheless.\u201cRon Antique Shop,\u201d Duncan muttered in a low voice, \u201cwhat a simple and direct shop name\u2026\u201dWhen finished, he searched for the key through what little he recalled. After rummaging around the entrance, he eventually found the spare key hidden under the windowsill.The body\u2019s original owner had done the homework to avoid being caught. Like taking a key that could identify himself as the owner of this antique shop for example.Quickly pushing the key into the door hole, Duncan easily slid inside with a small crack and closed the door behind himself. Despite his best effort to be incognito, the old wooden slab still made quite the slamming sound in the dead of night. Thankfully he\u2019s inside now, safe and away from prying eyes\u2026.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Purely going by how much dust had piled up near the window, it wouldn\u2019t take much for one to imagine how bad life must\u2019ve taken the owner.He first saw the table near the walls that are placed with large vases, sculptures, and totem-like things of unknown meaning. Meanwhile, the wall behind the storage table was decorated with a shelf, which had been used to place relatively small \u201cgoods\u201d in the store. There\u2019s also a long bar counter directly opposite the front door where the owner would receive guests. However, instead of the shelf behind the counter being filled with products, it\u2019s only adorned with some dusty picture frames and small ornaments \u2013 likely sentimental items by the owner.There\u2019s also a staircase leading up to the second floor right of the counter, which was groggy and difficult to make out due to the darkness. But Duncan did have some recollection of this area because there\u2019s also an out-of-sight door below the staircase. It leads to the warehouse in the back of the shop, which was mostly filled with clutters and stuff.Truly, it was hard to imagine how someone could make a living in this decrepit shop and even have money to offer the sun god religion.Duncan walked toward the counter to further examine the area. As he moved his foot carefully, the wooden creaking of the floor eventually caused him to pause, and that\u2019s when he noticed the lamp fixed to the wall.It was an electric light bulb.Duncan\u2019s brow immediately frowned at the recognition.The style of the lamp was unfamiliar with that wrought iron frame and grayish lampshade design, but in any case, the structure of the tungsten light bulb inside was immediately recognizable at a glance.Electricity is already this prevalent in the world that civilians in the lower sector of town can also afford it? Then why the gap and oil lamps in the underground sewers? They even used torches in some parts\u2026.Huge questions arose from the conflicting information, especially about the arrangements in the underground sewers.He had assumed those gas and oil lamps were due to the world\u2019s technological limitations, but that\u2019s clearly not the case. Instead, it was deliberate by the management of the city.Diving deep into his fragmented memory, Duncan tried to seek out the corresponding knowledge in his head. Sadly, the only answer he got was that \u201cit\u2019s common sense\u201d and \u201curban planning is so\u201d.Either this knowledge was not made public, hence the reason why his body here didn\u2019t know anything. Or, the knowledge was so basic that it left no impression on the cultist\u2019s mind.With momentary confusion in his heart, Duncan reached out and turned on the electric light. With the click of the switch, the bright light immediately illuminated the area near the staircase and counter.There\u2019s also a switch on the opposite wall that controls the lights in other storefront areas on the first floor, but Duncan wasn\u2019t going to move it for the time being.It\u2019s late at night, and a small light in an antique shop that has been closed could be explained as the owner getting up for a stroll, but lighting up the whole establishment would surely attract unnecessary attention.With the limited light near the staircase, Duncan\u2019s gaze first swept over the nearest goods and caught onto the wooden figure \u2013 it was less than half a meter high with a strange face pattern of red and blue paint. Then next to it were antique vases that looked like ceramic. These things looked shabby and old, but the outrageous price tag hinted at a different story.The original price was 420,000, and the discount was 36%\u2026.Duncan\u2019s gaze quickly shifted away and swept through the store. According to his assessment, he suspects there\u2019s not a single item that was genuine, and if there were, he would commit suicide by banging his head against the Vanished.It couldn\u2019t be any more fake. In fact, Duncan was confident no normal human being would ever believe this shop sold any real antiques. If anything, the oldest relic in this entire shop would be that signboard outside the door based on how shabby it looked\u2026.But Duncan wasn\u2019t surprised such a store existed in these parts. If the owner knew he was selling fakes, then why not? And if the customers knew they were here to buy fakes, then even better, right? This was the lower sector of the city, the area where commoners lived. Who could afford real antiques anyways? So, the signboard hanging outside the shop was merely a formality. Only the informed would visit.Anyways, regardless of whatever crummy lifestyle this body had before death, Duncan only had one thing that concerned him right now: could he use this place as a \u201cfoothold\u201d to transverse between the Vanished? He needed a safe location to transport supplies with Ai\u2019s ability. If this shop could provide shelter from prying eyes then that would be perfect.Duncan came behind the counter and sat down in a chair to comb through the memories in his possession. He\u2019s deliberating if the plan would work and the dangers that might entail.First, the original owner was a sun god believer, no doubt about that part, but only at the lowest level. He\u2019s a grunt, a nobody. And due to the city-state authorities cracking down on cult activities in recent years, it\u2019s become increasingly more challenging to take part in the events arranged by the organization.Even better, the \u201cmiddle man\u201d in charge of contacting him with the higher-ups were all dead from the previous spirit walk Duncan did, effectively destroying any connection between him and the other cultists. They wore masks during the gatherings so no one saw his face.Now, if he did have to consider a hidden danger that bothered him, Duncan would say it\u2019s the reason behind why the sun cultists are sacrificing people everywhere they could.Four years ago, the city-state of Pland attacked the sun cultists when they attempted to create a mass sacrifice at the city\u2019s heart \u2013 supposedly to resurrect their so-called Sun God.It would\u2019ve ruined the city if that did happen. Luckily, the authorities and the Church of the Deep Sea (Storm) vanquished the heretics before then. However, Duncan understood that the event was only a prelude to something much more terrible.He had no affection for Pland, but this city was too important to let it be destroyed by some fanatics.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He required communication with others, interaction with civilized society, and sustenance to survive. In short, he needed to interact with the rest of the city.Interaction meant clues, and clues meant Duncan could vaguely deduce what\u2019s needed to survive here in Pland. Like the general level of technology used by the citizens in their daily lives, that\u2019s something he needed to keep in mind.Eventually, through the memories he absorbed, Duncan found a small amount of cash in the hidden compartment behind the counter on the first floor. This included a handful of coins of varying denominations, which were common in most city-states since they were jointly certified and issued by the governing body of the government and the Chamber of Commerce of the Boundless Sea.These coins are called \u201cSora\u201d, and there are over two hundred of these, enough for a family of three to live for a month in the lower sector of town.It seems that even if the business is dismal, the original owner still managed to maintain his standard of living despite donating most of his wealth to the cult. At the very least, there\u2019s a stable stream of customers to support the revenue.After inspecting everything, from the rooms to the warehouse in the back, Duncan eventually returned to the master bedroom on the second floor. There\u2019s a picture frame here, and inside\u2026 was a black and white photo of a family of three. It\u2019s a young couple in plain clothes and a little girl around four to five years old, and they\u2019re smiling at the camera with an artificial background behind them.Duncan came before the thing and picked it up. Through careful examination, vague clues soon surfaced from his memory.The original owner of this body\u2026 is not in the photo. Does this mean they\u2019re close relatives of this body? They must be very dear to him\u2026As he gazed at the young couple some more, Duncan seemed to feel a faint sense of longing emerging from the depths of his memory.However, the rest of the information about these people was a blur to him. It appears everything else regarding this family had faded away following the original owner\u2019s death.Putting the black and white picture down, he pondered what an item like this would cost for a commoner until his eyes fell onto the neatly made bed. That\u2019s when uncertainty flooded into his heart.Would a cultist, who has completely fallen into the belief of the sun, have time to tidy up and clean on the weekend?The storefronts on the first floor have obviously been neglected, so how can the beds up here be so clean and meticulous?Coming out again, he went over to the smaller room across the stairs. Here, the bed and desk were equally as clean.Sorting through the memories some more, Duncan\u2019s sure the original owner of this body had never returned during the past few days. In other words, someone else had come here during that period.Someone else lives here? A loved one?Duncan frowned slightly, and as he searched for clues, he eventually came to the desk and checked the items. There are pens and papers here, but also a book with beautiful floral letters written as its title \u2013 The Art of Steam and Gear: General Textbook IIIThis made Duncan frown because it\u2019s no longer a suspicion that someone else also lived here. Then, out of curiosity, he picked up the textbook and flipped it open. Immediately, he was greeted by an illustrated inner page detailing the art of engineering and steam mechanics. The book owner also left many notes on the pages as reminders, a must for any academic student.Also, since the letters are so slender and beautiful, Duncan could assume it\u2019s from a young maiden because he sure as hell wouldn\u2019t write this neatly despite being a teacher himself.This discovery was causing his forehead to throb from overthinking. Still, as he dived deeper into the cold and lonely colors of those fragmented memories, Duncan eventually came upon a glimpse of what he wanted. It\u2019s a girl with dark brown hair standing in a warm, colorful background, someone whom Ron supposedly cared a lot about in this world.Duncan quickly shook off the discomfort and continued reading. He didn\u2019t care about the technical details written and instead looked for the editor\u2019s introduction and conceptual discussion regarding each chapter.Eventually, he caught a line that he\u2019s been looking for:\u201c\u2026\u2026 Flames, or more strictly, flames released by burning oils and mineral crystals from the deep sea, are the cornerstones that supported and protected our society and civilization\u2026\u201d\u201cThe prosperity and order of modern civilization is based on fire and steam \u2026 Clean and convenient electricity cannot replace the exorcism effect of fire, nor can it make large machines run stably for a long period of time\u2026 Experiments have shown that steam is the most stable form of power when affected by deep space\u2026\u201d\u201cIn this section, we will discuss three typical architectures of the steam core and explain the mechanical principles and design ideas in them\u2026\u201dDuncan\u2019s eyes slightly froze as he recalled the various forms of lighting in the sewers and streets.So is this the reason behind the \u201cweird\u201d situation? It\u2019s so they can resist or fend off whatever danger is lurking in the darkness?Duncan\u2019s heart flooded with inexplicable emotions as he continued to read the complex drawings and notes left behind by the owner\u2019s handwriting.It was a machine he couldn\u2019t understand at all, and it was definitely not the \u201csteam engine\u201d he knew in his previous life.The delicate gears, the extremely complex cylinders, and the pipes and valves between the various components are far beyond the concept of the steam engine, which was more like some kind of equipment that jumped out of a fantasy book. It\u2019s both contradictory and grotesquely beautiful.This is the \u201cheart\u201d that supports the progress of the world\u2019s civilization today\u2026During his contemplation, Duncan slowly placed the book back in its original position.As an earthling, even if he had been a teacher, he couldn\u2019t understand what the steam-powered mechanisms in this book were. It\u2019s been developed to the extreme, centuries ahead of whatever the Earth had concocted.But even so, a vague enlightenment emerged in his heart: the development of civilization in this world seems to have taken a very different route than what he had perceived.In order to survive in a world surrounded by crises, the mortal kingdom has also taken on a bizarre posture. But no matter how strange the world was, as long as it could still be called \u201ccivilization\u201d, it would have its own developmental structure and logic.The gas lamps that burn in the sewers, the electric lights that are lit in the shops, the steam organs depicted in books and condensed by the wisdom of an unknown number of people all vaguely revealed a kind of\u2026 sturdiness.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 44": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Deep Sea EmbersCH 43Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 43 \u201cGood Morning Mr. Duncan\u201dThis Translation is hosted on https://bcatranslation.com/After placing the book back in its place, Duncan examined the other furnishings in this room. Aside from the two notebooks in the desk drawer, there\u2019s nothing else of value \u2013 a sign that the small bedroom must\u2019ve been used infrequently.Then through the content of the notebooks, which were full of subjects about steam mechanisms and engineering principles, plus the occasional complaints of teachers and classmates, it\u2019s easy to judge the owner was a young maiden that still attended school.Duncan eventually returned to the master bedroom after restoring everything in the other room to its original state. He needed more time to comb through his memories, which he did by sitting at the edge of the bed.After a while, he got up again and went to the cabinet nearby. By following the reflexes in his muscles to open the cabinet door and one of the drawers, he fiddled around and found what he wanted: several bottles of spirits quietly hidden in the depths of the drawers, plus half a box of analgesic and nerve-relieving tablets, which were left behind by the cultist named \u201cRon\u201d in the world.The previous guy had a serious illness that had worsened to the point of no return, so poor-quality spirits and painkillers were the only things that could ease the pain at that time. However, pain remedies obviously did not help to prolong a sick patient\u2019s life.So, the man, who had lost all hope in his life, turned to the Sun Sect after the preacher told him about how the healing power of the Sun God could solve all ills of the world \u2013 including one\u2019s ailing body. That\u2019s how Ron converted to becoming a cultist.And to a certain extent, the cultists did keep their promise.By performing a gruesome and strange ritual, the cultists were able to transfer the vitality of the innocent into another body of its believers. Duncan did not know the principle behind such a ritual, nor did he know if it really cured the incurable disease. Still, according to the remnants of the fragmented memory, the cultist named \u201cRon\u201d did get better after the ceremony. It\u2019s the main reason the original owner of this body donated a large part of his family wealth to the cause \u2013 he got a taste of the forbidden fruit.But Duncan didn\u2019t care about what had happened between the dead cultists.Reaching deeper into the drawer, he smoothly groped around into the dark compartment and soon found a revolver and a box of bullets in good condition.The City-State of Pland does not forbid citizens to bear guns, requiring only legal formalities to purchase and carry. However, a dealer of fraudulent antiques in the lower sector of town obviously lacked the funds and credibility to obtain a gun permit. Therefore, it\u2019s almost certain this weapon was obtained illegally. But no matter. Legal or not legal, this gun now belonged to Captain Duncan.Exactly then, a slight noise suddenly caught his attention \u2013 it was the sound of a key rubbing against the door on the first floor.\u201cYou have a new message!\u201d Ai untimely chirps this while Duncan peered out the window to investigate.\u201cQuiet,\u201d he hushes the bird while holding the gun close to himself in readiness, \u201cyou stay here in the room and wait for my order. Also, keep your beak closed while outsiders are present.\u201dAi immediately flapped her wings and flew to a nearby cabinet, \u201cAye captain!\u201dDuncan hurried out of the room, and just as he was reaching the top of the stairs, he heard the rapid footsteps coming upwards, followed by a young and urgent girl\u2019s voice from below: \u201cUncle Duncan? Are you back?\u201dIn the next second, a girl with long dark brown hair in a long brown dress and white shirt came into Duncan\u2019s sight.The maiden looked to be only seventeen or eighteen years old, thin and small, her hair seemingly stained with a little morning dew. The girl\u2019s appearance was not too prominent, but she had the youthful beauty that this age should have while showing a surprised face after meeting Duncan at the stairwell.He did not respond, only standing there silently on the second floor and hiding behind the faint light shining through the narrow window gap. Eventually, he finally spoke using an uncertain voice: \u201cWhat did you just call me?\u201d\u201cUncle\u2026 Duncan?\u201d There was a moment of surprise on the girl\u2019s face, and then she tensed up by grabbing the handrail. The young girl was trying to see the face her uncle was making but couldn\u2019t due to the darkness, \u201cIs there something wrong? You\u2026 did you drink again? You haven\u2019t been home in days\u2026 and when I saw the light outside\u2026\u201dDuncan soaked in the information like a sponge there. According to his memories, this girl should be his \u201cniece\u201d and his only living relative, according to the original owner\u2019s memories anyway.What went wrong? Why would this girl, theoretically could not have known my secret, call out name \u201cDuncan\u201d so naturally?\u201cNina,\u201d he said after this name stormed out of his tongue, \u201cwere you staying at school yesterday?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been living in the school all these days,\u201d replied the girl under the stairs, \u201cI thought you would be out for at least a week like before. So, I packed up my things and went to burrow with my classmates\u2026. Mrs. White, who managed the dormitory, agreed to my request. I only came home today because I noticed I left a book behind\u2026. Are you okay Uncle? I feel like you\u2019re acting weird today\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine, just a little groggy from sleeping.\u201dDuncan naturally responded and then strode down the stair to the first floor. A ridiculous theory was brewing in his mind, and now he needed to confirm it.He and Nina crossed paths, allowing both to make eye contact. However, it wasn\u2019t until Duncan was at the bottom of the staircase did the girl call out, \u201cUncle Duncan, are you going out later? You\u2026\u2026 will you stay home for a few more days?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 depends on the situation,\u201d Duncan kept his back to her due to being uncertain what would happen, \u201cI\u2019m just going to check on the front door. If nothing happens, I\u2019ll be staying home for a few days.\u201d\u201cAh okay, then I\u2019ll go buy groceries. There aren\u2019t many ingredients at home\u2026\u201d The girl said quickly and briskly ran upstairs with the youthful air befitting that age.Duncan had already come up to the shop\u2019s entrance then. Inhaling a soft breath, he pushed open the door and looked up at the signboard overhead. It\u2019s still the old and dirty thing, but the words have changed like it\u2019s always been like this: Duncan\u2019s Antique Shop.Duncan frowned and slowly came to the nearby dirty glass window to peer at the reflection. It was indeed a strange face, not of the majestic and gloomy ghost captain, but of a tired-looking middle-aged man with a beard and deep eye sockets. This was Ron\u2019s face, the cultist who had already been swallowed up by death in the sewers.Eventually, the noise of the city life had cut him off from the inspection. It\u2019s livening up around him. First, the crisp sound of door bells ringing by doors opening around the streets were rampant, followed by the bicycle chimes and passers-by talking on the streets.\u201cGood morning, Mr. Duncan. Have you read today\u2019s newspaper? The Deep Sea Church seems to have destroyed a big cult den!\u201d Eventually, someone passing by the front of the antique shop even greeted him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The owner was a middle-aged man currently immersed in reading, and he waved his hand to signal the newspaper as a self-service without looking up.This roused Duncan to probe at what the other party was looking at \u2013 it was an analysis article of the previous lottery. Another one of those wishful players who had unrealistic fantasies of a colorful life.Then he glanced down at the newspaper he had just bought. The paper\u2019s front page had a title he was most interested in: A large number of believers got captured while a number of citizens were rescued\u2026The photograph of the \u201cInquisitor\u201d printed on the side of the front page was, to Duncan\u2019s surprise, a fairly young woman with a striking scar on her left eye. Still, the beautiful contour couldn\u2019t be ignored among her subordinates when her height was a notch above the average man.The inquisitor wore a tight-fitting lightweight armored battle dress and a two-handed sword that seemed to have come out of the era of cold weapons. It\u2019s the look of a sassy female knight in the style of medieval paintings, but contradicting this image was the huge steam robotic machinery behind her subordinates. It\u2019s both intimating and wonderful with those cannons mounted to the side\u2026.Duncan couldn\u2019t stop staring at this picture.The news of the cult\u2019s rally site being wiped out was good news for him. Without the fear of exposing himself, he could watch the villains who performed the sacrifice of the living being arrested and brought to justice without psychological pressure on his part. On top of this, he\u2019s also gained some new informationFemale inquisitors who specialize in dealing with cultists, heavily armed steam-armored robots, church armed forces with both cold and hot weapons\u2026The information that\u2019s extremely difficult to obtain on the Vanished had been displayed here for him to read after spending a measly twelve peso.As Duncan had thought, times had changed during the period where the Vanished was drifting aimlessly during the past century.Even if not from the superficial point of view of \u201cwho is better than whom\u201d, the mortal civilized society represented by the City-State of Pland has developed into a kind of\u2026 golden era.But the intersection of the street was no place to read the newspaper. Casually rolling up the prize in his arm, he hadn\u2019t forgotten there was still a \u201cniece\u201d by the name of Nina waiting for him at the antique shop.Compared with wandering the city aimlessly by himself, a local born with a trust bonus was obviously a better source of intelligence.As for the Vanished, Duncan didn\u2019t worry. Even in the state of Spirit Walking, he could still clearly perceive the situation on the ship, perceive the state of his other body, perceive how the goat head\u2019s steering the vessel at the helm, and how Alice was behaving herself in her room.Besides, the original crew code of conduct had the express rule of \u201cnot to bother the captain while he\u2019s in her private personal room\u201d. It shouldn\u2019t be an issue if he goes missing for a few days due to Spirit Walking, right?\u201dAnd as the duration continued, Duncan quickly noticed his control over this special \u201cmental projection\u201d becoming more and more proficient. Perhaps, sooner or later, he could even actively control both bodies at the same time without worry.A sweet smell suddenly drifted from the side and caught him by the nose. Stopping to look, he found himself staring at the newly opened pastry shop across the street.This was the lower side of the city where the poor lived, so there were no high-end dessert shops. Nevertheless, that doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t sweets suitable for those at the bottom of society. As it so happens, Duncan still had a few coins in his pocket to spend, which added up to twenty pesos, more than enough to buy a piece of cake.After a little hesitation, he went to the cake shop and paid for a piece of the most ordinary bee honey cake\u2014the packaging material the store used was some kind of thick paper of poor texture, which was rough to the touch.Unexpectedly, Duncan\u2019s mood was surprisingly happy today as she headed back to the antique shop.Walking the streets, talking to people, buying things, and returning to your accommodation.Such a simple thing finally gave him a sense of being alive again in another world. It\u2019s ordinary and simple, yet a daily routine he\u2019s been deprived of in recent days.Life on the Vanished was actually OK, the goat head could get annoying at times, and Alice was a fun individual to have around. But this experience on land side was different\u2014a totally refreshing experience.It didn\u2019t take long for Duncan to return to the antique shop, and before entering the store, he glanced upwards at the signboard again to confirm\u2014a row of letters telling it\u2019s Duncan\u2019s Antique Shop remained.The door chimed as he pushed open the wooden slab of wood he called a door, signaling his entry and drawing a rush of steps from the stairs.The long brown-haired girl had a nervous and worried expression after braking.\u201cUncle Duncan, where have you been?\u201d She said quickly, \u201cYou said you were going to check the front door, but you were gone in a blink of an eye\u2026 I thought you had gone to the tavern or gambling house again\u2026.\u201d?Duncan was surprised by the other side\u2019s level of care. She\u2019s genuinely worried about him, the kind of dependence of a relative looking out for someone you loved from the bottom of their heart. Even if said person was a drunken gambler contaminated with the sun cult\u2019s bloody deeds, it didn\u2019t matter here.\u201cI just went out for a walk and bought something on the way.\u201d As he spoke, he readily placed the cake and newspaper on the counter to show he was not lying, which seemingly put the girl at ease.\u201cUncle, hold on a bit, I will bring breakfast down here. You didn\u2019t eat yet, right? I cooked corn beet soup\u2026\u201d Before Duncan could speak, Nina\u2019s figure had disappeared up into the second floor until she returned with a large tray filled with a modest array of food for two.Duncan watched the girl smoothly arrange the table for him. He wanted to give a hand, but the level of diligence from Nina left no room for the guy to butt in. In the end, it left him with a bitter taste on his tongue because he knew what this indicated: a girl, the age of a high school student, must\u2019ve been forced to adapt to an environment beyond her age due to the \u201cuncle\u2019s\u201d lack of care\u2026.\u201cLet\u2019s eat,\u201d Nina had everything ready at this point, and she glanced at Duncan as if she had said it countless times, \u201cDr. Albert said that if you can eat breakfast regularly and keep a good mood, it will be better than spirits in the long run\u2026 Better than painkillers too.\u201dDuncan did not add anything to that comment, only staring quietly at Nina, who showed a suppressed and strained face. It\u2019s pretty clear the girl wanted this breakfast to work out, which he gladly obliged by pushing the cake box over.\u201cThis is\u2026\u201d Nina widens her eyes in surprise and confusion.\u201cCake bought from the newly opened shop around the corner,\u201d Duncan said casually, \u201cyou\u2019re growing and should eat something more nutritious for breakfast.\u201dNina showed a stunned face. Eventually, she started to murmur skeptically, \u201cUncle, are you sure you\u2019re OK?\u201d\u201cOf course I\u2019m all right,\u201d Duncan said with a relatively natural expression, \u201cI just remembered I haven\u2019t bought you a cake in a long time.\u201d\u201cIndeed, it\u2019s been more than a year\u2026\u201d Nina muttered before bursting out into a giggle. Then, grabbing a kitchen knife, \u201cThen we can both share half. Dr. Albert said you also need something nutritious.\u201dDuncan felt strange about the interaction, but after a moment of silence, he nodded: \u201cOK\u2026.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Yet, he\u2019s also currently sitting inside an antique shop sipping soup and having a peaceful breakfast with Nina, his so-called human niece.As if noticing the attention coming from the side, Nina, who was eating the cake, suddenly looked up curiously: \u201cUncle Duncan, aren\u2019t you going to eat?\u201dDuncan glanced at the food on the other side\u2019s plate: \u201cIs it enough?\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s not good to eat too many sweets.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201d Duncan nodded and took a bite out of his own slice. Immediately, his taste buds were attacked with the rich sweetness of honey and the mellow texture of the soft fluffy sponge in his mouth. But more than the flavor and texture, he\u2019s more surprised by the fact that his stomach was able to process the food!Clearly, unlike the first body Duncan possessed, this second one he\u2019s occupying had been revived with his interference. The soul of Ron may have died, but the flesh lives on. It\u2019s able to breathe, bleed, and eat like a normal human being.However, there was one thing the ghost captain wasn\u2019t quite sure about.He knew his body here must be ridden with a severe illness, that\u2019s the most prominent memory and emotion he gained from possessing this body. The spirits and painkillers in the drawers were a testament to this fact.Did my interference cure the illness? Or did the body heal itself after being revived by my arrival? Perhaps, the health of this body is still deteriorating and I\u2019m only not aware of it due to my spirit walking ability?Duncan grew quiet while he mulled over this, and then he suddenly thought of something else: \u201cDon\u2019t you have school today?\u201dNina lived in the lower sector of the city, where economic conditions were poor in this household. Nevertheless, education was a universal thing in the city-state of Pland thanks to the support of the church and city hall.As it so happens, her subject mostly had to do with steam engines and engineering, a study that was difficult and important for the church and factories.Due to this major, Nina\u2019s tuition had been partly paid for by her uncle, while the rest was done through scholarships from the city. Thankfully the girl didn\u2019t disappoint. According to her uncle\u2019s memory, she\u2019s always had excellent grades in all her classes.\u201cI don\u2019t have classes this morning,\u201d Nina nodded, \u201conly two history classes in the afternoon. In addition, I have to go talk to Mrs. White in the afternoon that I\u2019m not staying in the dormitory during the next few days\u2026\u201dDuncan suddenly stopped his gesture of scooping the soup and stared at Nina with a serious face, \u201cDon\u2019t you think staying here and taking care of someone like me will delay many things? If you stay at school, it might be more helpful to your studies.\u201dNina was stunned by the concern in her \u201cUncle Duncan\u2019s\u201d voice but promptly got angry instead, \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t talk like that! You\u2019re just sick. You will get better if you follow the doctor\u2019s instructions and take the medicine. Mom and Dad entrusted you to me\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt was your parents who entrusted you to me,\u201d Duncan corrected the girl right away and organized his language, \u201cYou were only six back then.\u201d\u201cBut now I\u2019m seventeen,\u201d Nina puffed her face up and stabbed the fork into the last piece of cake on her plate, \u201cyour ability to care for yourself is inferior to me. If I did move out, it wouldn\u2019t take more than three days for you to turn this room into a mess. In fact, I can also help out with the store. At least I can clean up the dirty windows and floors. I can barely see through the glass anymore\u2026.\u201dDuncan listened helplessly to the girl\u2019s \u201cpreaching\u201d since he didn\u2019t expect his words would bring such a big reaction from the other party.But slowly, he couldn\u2019t help but laugh again.He felt a temperature in this girl named \u201cNina\u201d\u2026 A warmth that\u2019s bathed in sunlight.\u201cAlright, it\u2019s just a casual mention,\u201d he said and shook his head before stirring the soup bowl with the spoon. \u201cThe afternoon is history class\u2026 How are your studies going in that class?\u201d\u201cUncle Duncan, are you really all right?\u201d Nina\u2019s got wide in surpise, \u201cYou\u2019ve never been\u2026 Well, at least in the past two years, I have never heard you asking about my studies.\u201dDuncan was about to explain when the girl cut him off by continuing, \u201cWe are talking about ancient history recently, and Mr. Morris is telling us about the events after the Great Annihilation\u2026 To be honest, it\u2019s quite interesting. Ancient history sounds much like the stories you find in fictional books, far more enjoyable than modern history.\u201dDuncan contemplated what she meant and inquired further, \u201cSounds like you\u2019re studying well? I\u2019ll test you then. What is the concept of the Great Annihilation?\u201dUncle Duncan is acting very strange today. Although I can\u2019t tell why, but different from his usual self.But Nina didn\u2019t think much of it. The simple girl was just glad that her uncle\u2019s mood was happier and not the usual depressed state.So, with a proud smile, she began to tell Duncan what she had learned:\u201cThe Great Annihilation took place about 10,000 years ago. Although for unknown reasons, ethnic minorities with unique cultural traditions such as the Elves, Dwarves, and the Orcs recorded inconsistent dates in their own calendars, but in general, archaeologists agreed that the Great Annihilation occurred at the end of the Age of Order ten thousand years ago\u2026\u201dDuncan calmly listened but got a boatload of question marks in his mind.Elves? Dwarves? Orcs? What\u2019s going on here? So there is not only one intelligent race on land? And the elves\u2026 are they the same type of race like I know of? Is there also another city-state living in an industrial steam age?He couldn\u2019t help but come up with some very strange pictures in his mind until Nina\u2019s voice interrupted again:\u201c\u2026\u2026 There are certain discrepancies in the accounts of the Great Annihilation in various city-states, but the common part is that the Order Era before the Great Annihilation was a far more prosperous, stable, and secure era than it is today. Back then, there were extremely vast continents with an ocean less extensive than what it is today. There is also no \u2018reality border\u2019 like now between land and sea\u2026.\u201d\u201cThe era after the Great Annihilation is called the \u2018Deep Sea Age\u2019, and the Deep Sea Age continues to this day with no signs of it ending. The most striking feature of the Deep Sea Age is that the vast sea covers almost the entire world, while less than 10% of the land is left from the old era. Currently, all of the city-states are on various island, with ships crossing the ocean as the main mean of communication between each settlement.\u201d\u201cIn the early days of the Deep Sea Age, the remnants of the Old World suffered heavy losses with entire civilization nearly brought to the brink of destruction. Among the many powers that rose afterward, the \u2018Ancient Kingdom of Crete\u2019 is the first and most notable within the historical texts. Its legacy lasted for merely a century before its collapse, but its influence on future generations could still be felt today. Like the primitive and crude classification of anomalies in the world, it\u2019s the very foundation for our refined system today.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Sure, the archaeological community has been making efforts in this regard to search for clues, but the discrepancy between the states and races was too different to give a proper conclusion. All they knew was that the current Deep Sea Age, an era of water and malicious danger, had come out of the chaotic fog thereafter.Nina naturally didn\u2019t know there was a ghost captain drawing knowledge through words; instead, she only thought that her uncle desired to test herself.This brought a lot of joy to the girl\u2019s day because they had not shared in these warm moments in a very, very long time, especially when her uncle would return to the irritable state the minute after the spirits and painkillers wore off.So, before her Uncle Duncan fell ill again, she wanted to show off her progress\u2014which might keep his good mood going for another day or two at least.\u201c\u2026\u2026 Mr. Morris is very interested in the history of the Kingdom of Crete, and he\u2019s one of the leading experts on this subject. He told us that although the ancient Kingdom of Crete lasted only a hundred years, it was the first civilization after the advent of the Deep Sea Age to rise from the ruins to fight against anomalies and visions. Even now, their research continues to dictate our advancement in the world, especially the classification of \u2018anomalies\u2019 and \u2018visions\u2019\u2026\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a classification of \u2018anomalies\u2019 and \u2018visions\u2019?\u201d Duncan raised his eyebrows, not forgetting to guide the girl on the path he wanted.He had been very concerned about this topic since the beginning of their conversation. Unlike his original assumption of all supernatural events being called \u201canomalies\u201d, there\u2019s apparently another classification called \u201cvisions\u201d, which was entirely different if he had to guess.Nina nodded, remembering what she had heard in class, \u201cOld Mr. Morris taught us that the easiest way to distinguish between anomalies and visions is the scale they exist as.\u201d\u201cUsually, the scale of anomalies is small, often limited to an object, animal, or even a person.\u201d\u201cAnomalies can also be artificially moved due to their limited range of influence \u2013 usually to only one person at a time. Knowing this fact, we can move the anomalies to another location for sealing or isolation. In rare cases, we would even exploit the more innocuous anomalies by using tools and such as a medium.\u201d\u201cThe scale of \u201cvisions\u201d is far greater than the anomalies, and the smallest vision is the size of a house, with the larger ones spanning the whole city. In rare cases, the size can become so big that it\u2019s hard to imagine.\u201d\u201cA considerable number of visions are incapable of being moved by man, they are either fixed in one place or operate according to their own will, and their ability to affect is far greater than that of anomalies. Usually, visions can affect so many targets within their effective range that they can almost be equated with the idea of \u2018natural phenomena\u2019, hence the term \u2018vision\u2019.\u201cUnlike anomalies, almost all \u2018visions\u2019 cannot be sealed or controlled. They exist in the world like the natural order, operating undisturbed by outside forces. Since most visions are dangerous, the only thing one can do is to avoid these dangerous locations and not get tagged by their range\u2026.\u201d\u201cFortunately, the most dangerous visions usually do not move, and the pioneers of the past have helped us identify these dangers so that we could safely keep our distance from them\u2026\u201dNina said very seriously, and then as if suddenly remembering something, she quickly added: \u201cAh yes, Teacher also mentioned to us that these distinguishing methods and characteristics are only \u2018usually effective\u2019 and not absolute. Anomalies and visions are unreasonable things, so no matter how people sum up their experiences, there will always be anomalies or visions that do not conform to the definition. On top of that, the two can sometimes interchange between the two categories.\u201d\u201cLike in the new City-State calendar for example \u2013 in 1830, the city-state of Renza had a runaway anomaly called Fungal, forcing the local church officials to pay a great price to banish this uncontrolled anomaly to a nearby island, which in 1835 got identified as a vision. Then in the year 1844, the great Saint Palatine took his own life on the fungal island and used his own urn to remove this threat. Nowadays, this urn housing Fungal is renamed Mushroom Urn of Palatine in honor of that great saint and his sacrifice. It\u2019s currently sealed underground in the cathedral of City-State Lenza as a relic \u2026\u201dDuncan listened intently to what Nina was telling, causing his mind to race wildly from ups and downs.In this short breakfast alone, he had gathered more information than he had spent so many days on the Vanished combined! Once again, he\u2019s proven that communication on land and setting up an outpost within the city was the most effective way of aggregating intelligence about this world!A civilization that has developed to the industrial stage must find ways to compress the basic knowledge of the functioning of society into its own education system. Otherwise, it would become difficult for the rest of society to follow. As a result, Nina could never fathom how much of a treasure-trove of knowledge she truly held in her hands. For that, Duncan appreciated her kindness and innocence.\u201cSo\u2026.. Mr. Morris told us at the end of the last lesson that in dealing with \u2018abnormalities\u2019 and \u2018visions\u2019, there is only one true and eternally valid rule. That is, \u2018No matter how many laws we summarize, there will be anomalies or visions that do not conform to the law in the world\u2019.\u201cThis rule, also known by scholars as \u2018Eternal Zero\u2019, is by default at the top of all books and papers in the field.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Based on her hand movements, it\u2019s obvious she\u2019s been doing these chores for a long time. No doubt the cleaned and maintained bedrooms are also her work.Duncan had every reason not to help. As an uncle who\u2019s been seriously ill, decadent, and dedicated most of his energy to a cult\u2019s corrupted cause, he would never bother with such things. But he\u2019s not that person. So with the urge to help, he picked up the large tray from Nina\u2019s hand: \u201cI\u2019ll help you carry this. It\u2019s bothersome seeing you run upstairs like this.\u201dThis roused a stunned look from Nina\u2019s face. She wanted to say something but stopped after the man began to leave her behind.Hurrying to catch up: \u201cUncle, be careful, the doctor said your current condition is not stable\u2026\u201d\u201cDoctors\u2026 Dr. Albert?\u201d Duncan kept his back to her while walking upstairs. According to the corresponding impression in the memory fragments, that\u2019s the name of the physician in charge of his illness, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, we have no clue as to what my illness anyways. The most he can do is prescribe painkillers for me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 Then you should also listen to the doctor\u2019s advice,\u201d Nina followed Duncan up to the second floor and protested all the way to the kitchen, \u201che at least knows how to keep one healthy\u2026\u201dHalfway through Nina\u2019s speech, a flapping of wings suddenly interrupted her nagging and caused them both to swing their heads in the direction. They didn\u2019t see what exactly the thing was because it flew in such a blur, but they did catch the direction of where it went.\u201cUncle Duncan, something just went into your room!\u201d Nina exclaims, her body running out in pursuit, \u201cit could be the neighbor\u2019s cat\u2026\u201d\u201cAigh, don\u2019t\u2026.\u201dDuncan only had time to say half a sentence when he saw Nina pushing open the door to reveal the white dove hiding in the master bedroom.Ai was standing on top of the cupboard, one claw grabbing a French fry and stuffing it in her mouth when the door suddenly swung open. This created an awkward scene where two humans stared at an unexpected bird.\u201cAh\u2026 googoo?\u201d Ai quickly corrected herself and flapped that wing to act all innocent.Duncan\u2019s eyes twitched somewhat after he noticed the opened window. This was clearly the work of this dove, which had a direct view of the pier across the rooftops.She actually went to the dock and came back with some French fries\u2026.\u201cA dove?\u201d Nina finally came back to her senses and exclaimed, \u201cUncle Duncan! You have a dove in your room!\u201d\u201cI can see that,\u201d Duncan grimaced, \u201cI don\u2019t know it.\u201dAi immediately threw the fries aside and flew over, landing on Duncan\u2019s shoulder and shaking her head to rebuke the denial.\u201cFine~ It flew in this morning,\u201d Duncan sighed, \u201cit may be someone else\u2019s pet, but its brain isn\u2019t very clever, so now it\u2019s refusing to leave after I fed it.\u201dAi listened and made a loud googoo noise.If it weren\u2019t for the presence of outsiders and Duncan had given the order before, she would have begun to shout \u201cAh yes yes yes\u201d at this time for sure.Nina did not doubt her uncle\u2019s statement in the slightest. Staring wide with light in those eyes, she leaned over carefully: \u201cThat\u2026 do you want to raise it? Can I raise it?\u201dThe girl\u2019s desire was written all over te face. Without a doubt, Ai was a lovely bird with pristinely white feathers, so it was no surprise that Nina would be smitten by its charm.After a moment, he pretended to hesitate for a moment before nodding: \u201cYes, but only if the pigeon is willing to stay. It may fly away at some point, and you can\u2019t complain when the time comes.\u201dNina smiled happily, \u201cGreat! I knew Uncle Duncan is a reasonable man!\u201d\u2026\u2026In the central prayer room of the Cathedral of the Storm, the city-bishop Valentine, dressed in the black robe of a priest, stood solemnly in front of the statue of the Storm Goddess.He\u2019s a tall, thin man with sparse white hair and eyes as calm as the water. Right now, he\u2019s currently discussing an important topic with Inquisitor Vanna, who had come to seek his advice early in the morning.\u201c\u2026\u2026 If what you saw in your dream is correct, then indeed, that is the Vanished,\u201d Valentine says after hearing the full story.Although the status of bishop and inquisitor are on equal footing in terms of rank, but having the latter seek out advice from the former was a common practice since clerics are more knowledgeable in their studies.\u201cSo it is the Vanished?\u201d Despite having the answer in mind already, Vanna still couldn\u2019t help but heave a long sigh at the bishop\u2019s judgment, \u201cI thought\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou thought it\u2019s just a legend, right? The type of ghost ship mentioned by the nervous sailors bragging about their ventures in the tavern?\u201d Valentine knew what Vanna was trying to say and promptly shut it down, \u201cThe existence of the Vanished is a fact recognized by all city-states and churches. It is not a legend, but something that can be found in the archives.\u201d\u201cI know the Vanished did exist at one time and that we can even find the blueprints for the ship in the city archives. However, all those details related to that ship are limited to when it\u2019s still a vessel sailing in the real world. When that Captain Duncan is still a human\u2026.\u201d Vanna spoke in a serious tone, and then her expression became more cautious upon looking up at the statue behind the bishop. \u201cThe point is that the ship was clearly recorded as to have crashed into subspace\u2026 A century ago, thousands of fugitives from the thirteen islands of Wieseland witnessed the ship and their homeland being swallowed up by the collapse of the border and falling straight into the shadows. In the decades since, although eyewitness reports of seeing the Vanished reappearing in the real world would pop up once in a while, but there is no real evidence, and a considerable number of scholars have doubts about the ship\u2019s \u2018return\u2019\u2026\u201d\u201cIs it really possible that something swallowed up by subspace can reappear in the real world?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 To date, nothing but the Vanished has ever returned to reality after falling into subspace, that is a fact. Even if it is the Vanished, there are only after-the-fact sightings, that is also a fact. Scholars from all walks of life doubt the ship\u2019s return like you said, but that\u2019s not the key factor\u2026\u201d The old man said, his eyes suddenly falling on Vanna with a certain seriousness on his face, \u201cThe key is what is making so you afraid?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This means your subconsciousness is actively avoiding the threat placed before your eye.\u201d\u201cInquisitor Vanna, from the look of things, that ship is already swaying you with its powers.\u201dVanna felt a fine layer of sweat on her forehead, but the \u201cdrapery\u201d that had confused her all night had disappeared, giving her clarity that the bishop was right.When did I get affected by the Vanished? When did it happen?!This was exactly what many visions and anomalies with horrific tendencies possessed: making the contact cognitively confused until they\u2019ve completely fallen into a state of denial. It\u2019s an intelligent creature\u2019s mean to protect themselves. By denying something, one could avoid being tainted further.As an inquisitor who often deals with supernatural powers, Vanna knows this knowledge very well, but she never thought that she would fall into this \u201cpsychological trap\u201d since she\u2019s known to have strong willpower.\u201cI don\u2019t know when I was affected,\u201d she said frankly.In the presence of her fellow devout bishops, Vanna did not shy away from the weakness she had exposed this time. It was perfectly normal to fall into a psychological abnormality due to anomalies or visions, and shame and concealment would only make the issue worse.\u201cI came here directly after waking up from the foreboding dream. I didn\u2019t talk to anyone, nor did I touch any books or relics. I cannot think of a point when I got corrupted.\u201d\u201cBut you have just shown a deliberate avoidance of the omen you received in your dream\u2026 So, the corruption should have happened earlier than that,\u201d the bishop gazed intently at Vanna\u2019s face as if observing her changing eyes and breathing fluctuation would reveal the secret. \u201cHave you been exposed to anything abnormal lately? That could have been from the Vanished\u2026 directly polluting your subconsciousness ahead of time.\u201d\u201cRecently\u2026\u201d Vanna frowned and then suddenly recalled the \u201csacrifice\u201d that had fallen at the scene of the Black Sun ritual. That time she encountered the flash of green flame shooting out of the corpse\u2019s eye and causing her to sever a finger as a consequence.Jerking to attention and showing a shocked face: \u201cThe day before yesterday, I led a team to clean up the black sun sacrificial site in the sewers. Did you get my report about the nameless corruption I found at the scene?\u201dThe bishop shook his head: \u201c\u2026 No, you directly went back to your place after sending over the cultists.\u201dVanna became startled at the truth, \u201cDid anyone else who participated in the operation that day report about this?\u201d\u201cNothing, the church did not get any report about your finding. All the reports we had were about the Dark Sun heretics.\u201dUnder the witness of the storm goddess\u2019s statue, the bishop and inquisitor both exchanged a nod at the realization.\u201cIt seems that we have found the point at which the corruption first came ashore,\u201d the bishop exhaled softly, his expression still calm but grim, \u201cIn the name of the goddess, do you swear that your memory of that night is still complete and clear?\u201dVanna took a deep breath, \u201cIn the name of Gomona, I swear that all I say and remember is the truth and nothing but the truth.\u201dThe bishop nodded, then turned and lit the special incense set up in the rear. With a calm and divine voice, \u201cGo ahead Inquisitor Vanna, the goddess is now watching us. No corruption shall taint this room.\u201dIn the following confession, Vanna revealed everything she remembered about what happened in the sewers that night. She spared no detail, and under the reinforcement of the special incense in the room, the memories were so vivid that it sounded like she\u2019s reliving that night in pristine clarity.She still remembers how the green flame flickered in that sunken eye socket when she pried it open, then of how the guardians and clerics all went quiet afterward despite performing the purification procedure on themselves. All of that was as she remembered, but what happened next was the freaky part that got covered up. Instead of their usual rowdy behavior of bringing the prisoners back to the church, everyone at the site had marched out of the sewers like they\u2019ve been possessed. Puppets, that\u2019s how they were walking through the streets in the middle of the night.Vanna found herself numb to the bone looking back at things. If the other party wanted to kill everyone then, it would\u2019ve been easy taking.\u201c\u2026\u2026 The ghost flame infected your soul so the physical purification you performed in the sewer is ineffective, that\u2019s how you all got deceived. What you all should\u2019ve done is sprinkle holy oil on the ground and create a temporary holy ground to call upon the goddess\u2019s power with your prayers. That would\u2019ve purified your \u2018spirit\u2019 and cleansed the corruption.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s my fault,\u201d Vanna said in a heavy tone, \u201cI should have been more vigilant and alert.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a mistake, but not a fault,\u201d the old man shook his head, \u201cyou have great strength, but as an inquisitor, you\u2019re still lacking in experience. Fortunately, we have now cured you of that influence, which means the corruption on that \u2018corpse\u2019 is not too strong. It only managed to interfere you at a psychological level so the source must\u2019ve been cut off that night.\u201dAt this point, Bishop Valentine paused as if weighing something: \u201cThe guardians who were acting with you at that time will likely return to normal in a few days according to the feedback from the incense. What we need to worry about is what\u2019s to come, the future.\u201d\u201cThe future\u2026\u201d Vanna repeated the bishop\u2019s last words, her expression slowly becoming serious.Yes, in the future, this matter is not over yet.The picture of the omen from my dream warned of a storm coming. The event last night was merely a prelude to that.\u201cThe Vanished has not been sighted for many years, and most people believe the ship is lost in subspace for good. But it appears that\u2019s not true. Captain Duncan\u2019s obsession with the real world isn\u2019t finished yet\u2026\u201dBishop Valentine recited his finding slowly while turning as he gazed up at the statue of the Storm Goddess.\u201cA century ago, the Vanished crashed into the depths of subspace. Although there is no clear evidence, many eyewitness reports mentioned that there was a major storm hovering in the nearby waters that caused it to fall\u2026 The storm, that\u2019s the authority of our Lord.\u201dVanna frowned, \u201cYou think that Captain Duncan is going to\u2026 exact revenge on the goddess?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say. Even if the ghosts returning from subspace are out to seek revenge, but gods are gods, they live in the kingdom of heaven above our own. Never has there been a case of something climbing up to the higher realms beyond reality, only descending downwards. But if Captain Duncan is seeking revenge on our Lord\u2019s human emissaries\u2026 the danger this poses would be endless. Our church\u2019s influence may stretch to every part of the world because we represent the Storm Goddess, but if there\u2019s going to be a target, it would likely be here in Pland. We are the heart of our faith on land, and the Holy Cathedral of the Storm is difficult to pinpoint.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Unlike common sense, the \u201ccornerstone\u201d was located not at the bottom of the world but at the apex of all dimensions.The ancient Kingdom of Crete describes the structure of the world as they were known in the surviving texts:The cornerstone of the world stood at the very top of what\u2019s known, guarded by eternal truth and order. As its denizen, gods are eternal for merely living there.From the kingdom of Gods downwards, it was the reality where all mortal beings are born. Through the afterglow of the gods, mortals are able to survive in the relatively stable and rich real world that we know today.But below that would be the spirit world. It was the realm of ghosts and spirits that gradually deviates from the cognition of mortals. In the spiritual world, the blessings of the gods have been thinned, and the twisted and grotesque forces are able to prevail.Then further downwards, beyond the spiritual world that no higher god could touch, there lies the deep sea that was no longer suitable for the survival of any living creature \u2013 a domain dominated by strange forces, a realm that\u2019s the reflection of the void.However, there\u2019s still something at the bottom beyond the deep sea\u2014the depth of subspace entrenched in the shadowy crevice of all things. In there, dwelled the extremely dangerous ancient gods from a time lost to memory. They\u2019re sinister and carry the malice of those lost forever in the void.According to the accounts of the ancient kingdom of Crete, the gods were the ones who set the criteria dictating all living things. However, such a rule doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s omnipotent. As one further dive into the lower domains, the power of the higher gods will decline, and gradually, the foul existence in subspace will fight back and vie for dominance.This was the setup of the current world. Order and light at the top, darkness and chaos at the bottom. Two opposing forces using the mortal reality as their battleground.The knowledge was the ancient gift left to the world by the glorious civilization that pioneered the Deep Sea age 10,000 years ago. In the long years since, countless scholars have studied the \u201chierarchical structure\u201d without finding any fault in the model. Nowadays, such a theory has universally become known as the \u201cWorld Standard Model\u201d.In this Standard Model, earthly mortals will fall into deeper places, but few people can return from the \u201cdeep\u201d to the \u201cshallow\u201d. In rare cases of the lucky few that do return, none had ever shown the desire to subvert the heavens, which acted as the cornerstone of their world.It was precisely for this reason that the return of the Vanished from subspace will become the world\u2019s most outrageous vision\u2014its return violates the world\u2019s understanding of the Standard Model.But on the other hand, the existence of the Vanished was in line with the classic statement about anomalies and visions: nothing is ever permanent.In any case, neither Bishop Valentine nor Vanna thought that the ghost captain had the ability to take revenge on the Storm Goddess\u2014even if he had the heart, he wouldn\u2019t have the power.The reason for their belief? Because the \u201ccornerstone\u201d and the real world are not continuously interconnected. At least so far, no scholar has found evidence that the \u201ccornerstone\u201d and the real world could be directly connected. Even the gods could only indirectly stretch their influence through projection, metaphor, and other methods. Meanwhile, a ghost ship\u2026 where would it find the means to strike at the higher realms?Since it was impossible to seek revenge on the Storm Goddess herself, the only choice left was of course the Goddess\u2019s followers in the earthly world.As the headquarters of the Church of the Deep Sea, the Cathedral of the Storm was an \u201cark\u201d that sailed in seclusion on the Boundless Sea, coming and going without a trace. What\u2019s more, the Pope\u2019s crown sitting on the ark had the power to control the storm on behalf of the Lord, which was not a good target at all less the Vanished wanted to be sunk by the waters.Now here comes the city-state of Pland into the equation. This point was fixed at sea, an island with clear will to open up to the outside world. Such a fine target, with over eighty percent of its residences being devout followers of the Storm Goddess, who would pass it up?Vanna had decided that the ghost captain cane for vengeance over its own demise\u2014after all, the Vanished had fallen into subspace in a storm a hundred years earlier\u2014and she couldn\u2019t think of any other reason why the ghost ship would suddenly return to reality without cause. All clues are pointing to this theory.But what exactly does that ghost captain intend to do?Vanna deeply furrows her forehead in thought: \u201cBishop Valentine, do you think\u2026 the Vanished have anything to do with the recent movements of the Black Sun\u2019s followers in the city-state?\u201dAfter saying this, she paused before adding: \u201cIn last night\u2019s dream, I saw the burning sun and the Vanished appearing in Pland together, and the simultaneous arrival of two disasters may be a sign given to me by the goddess\u2026\u201d\u201cA reasonable speculation, but don\u2019t forget, the tainted \u2018sacrifice\u2019 killed the priest of the Black Sun in the underground site, and that individual was a baptized emissary of the Black Sun.\u201d The bishop shook his head to rebuke the idea, \u201cAt the very least, we can go by the evidence that the Black Sun\u2019s followers and the Vanished are at odds against one another.\u201dVanna went quiet as she contemplated her peer\u2019s insight. She couldn\u2019t object to that finding.\u201cIn regards to the cultists we captured. I got some tip-offs from the city-state of Lenza this morning\u2026\u201d The old bishop continues after getting no response.Vanna jerked up in surprise, \u201cA tip?\u201d\u201cThe sun heretics not only revived in Pland, but they have also been active in the other city-states recently. We have credible reports that they\u2019ve been transiting through the ports of Renza and Moco to gather somewhere.\u201d The old bishop now sounded worried, \u201cThe officials there have managed to capture a few of them, and during the interrogation, the heretics are mentioning the \u2018sun\u2019s fragment\u2019.\u201d\u201cSun fragment\u2026 You mean the supposed real body of their sun god after its disintegration?\u201d Vanna appeared shocked by the news, \u201cThey think the piece fragment is hidden here in Pland?\u201d\u201cIt seems that this is the case. It is not known where the heretics got this information, or it may have been a \u2018revelation\u2019 from their madness, but in short, they now firmly believe that part of their Lord\u2019s remains is hidden in our city. It\u2019s very likely they are intending to revive that dark god.\u201d\u201cThose lunatics\u2026.\u201d Vanna couldn\u2019t help but curse in a huff, \u201cHow many lives have they mutilated in order to resurrect that dark and blasphemous sun!\u201d\u201cThe Black Sun is how we address their god, but in their mind, that being represented the truest order. You can\u2019t expect the irrationals to have a conscience about blood on their hands.\u201d Valentine shook his head, \u201cThey firmly believe in what they say is just, and there are only two methods of dealing with such people: subdue them or kill them.\u201dVanna\u2019s mouth twitched at her peer\u2019s blunt answer: \u201cIt looks like we are going to be busy in the coming days.\u201d\u201cThe vast sea has never been peaceful, and the city-states are in the vast sea,\u201d Valentine recited, \u201cthe captains have to face the storms in the oceans, and we have to confront the storms brought on by the fools of the world. Inquisitor, prepare yourself. The city-state of Pland is about to face its greatest challenge yet!\u201d\u201cTwo challenges,\u201d Vanna corrected the bishop, \u201cin addition to the followers of the Black Sun, there is also a mysterious and terrifying ghost captain. If the Vanished and Black Sun really aren\u2019t working together, then our trouble has changed from one to two.\u201dBishop Valentine groaned slightly: \u201cMaybe there is another way. Going by the situation in the sewer, maybe the Vanished will fight with the believers of the Black Sun?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 Then it only means the troubles have merged into one earth-shattering trouble, Bishop Valentine, \u201cVanna eyes the old man in front of her who had obviously begun to think differently, \u201cI can\u2019t think of a worse combination of bad news than that. Nothing good will come of two threats taking place at one time.\u201dValentine sighed and admitted that Vanna was right.\u201cIn short, have our clerics and watchmen work with the city police. We must arrest those sun heretics who have infiltrated the city-state and eliminate this threat before the other comes.\u201d Vanna intends to remove one so they can focus all their attention on the ghost ship, effectively minimizing the danger posed by the two. \u201cAs for the ghost ship, we don\u2019t know what it would do next so we will leave it for the time being. Have everyone monitor the sea around the city though\u2026.\u201d\u2026\u2026\u201cI\u2019d like to add some more ketchup\u2026\u201d Duncan beckoned to Nina across the table, \u201cI can do it myself so hand me the bottle.\u201dNina immediately handed the ketchup over, \u201cOkay Uncle Duncan.\u201dIt\u2019s now noon, and Duncan and Nina are having lunch in the small kitchen on the second floor. The food in the antique shop was simple \u2013 a local salty pancake served with tomato sauce or hot sauce. They also had a serving of vegetable soup that was not exactly delicious. Nevertheless, both diners were happy enough about the moment since such a scene hadn\u2019t been common in their lives for quite some time.Duncan was truly starting to like this place a whole lot.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He wanted to help with the dishes, sadly, he got promptly shut down by this niece under the ground that \u201cUncle is not in good health and the doctor said to avoid cold water\u201d. In the end, this pirate captain could only lean near the stairwell and read the newspaper he bought this morning.This kind of a daily scene that ordinary folks took for granted, for some reason, gave him a strange sense of calm inside. But before he could act on it, Nina\u2019s voice had come again from the kitchen: \u201cUncle Duncan, is there any news in the newspaper?\u201dGlancing down at the newspaper, the first of which was the date of \u201cAugust 14, 1900 in the New City State Calendar,\u201d followed by the news that the church inquisitor had led a team to arrest dozens of cultists: this was probably the weightiest front-page in the entire newspaper.\u201cIt says that the inquisitor led her team to arrest dozens of sun heretics,\u201d he said casually, \u201cand it mentioned that this was the largest heretical rally that the church had successfully cracked down upon in the past four years. The paper is also reminding the public to pay attention to night safety and to identify the heretical believers around themselves.\u201d\u201cAh, I heard that on the way here too!\u201d Nina puts away the washed bowl into the cupboard and quickly scrambled to wipe the table, \u201cIt\u2019s really scary. I\u2019ve heard the teacher say those cultists who worship the sun will even sacrifice the living to their god\u2026 I can\u2019t believe there would be crazy people like that believing in such an evil cult.\u201dDuncan didn\u2019t know what to say for a moment. It didn\u2019t matter what he said, it would still feel weird. It\u2019s not like he could tell the niece that he had recently experienced the pleasure of being sacrificed and then counter sacrificing the cultists?However, one thing\u2019s clear from Nina\u2019s reaction: she obviously did not know the fact that her \u201cuncle\u201d had become a sun heretic. To the poor girl, her family had only behaved a little grumpier due to the illness and constant abuse of alcoholic painkillers.Maybe one day in the future, some cultist named \u201cRon\u201d will really fall to the last step and drag his last living relative into the endless abyss, but at least until today, this has not happened yet, nor will it happen in the future.\u201cUncle? Why did you suddenly stop talking?\u201d Nina grew a little curious about the silence behind her and spoke with concern, \u201cUncomfortable again?\u201d\u201cNo, I just got a little distracted,\u201d Duncan shook his head, \u201cwhat you said is true, the stuff they\u2019re doing is indeed mad\u2026 The newspaper also mentioned that the public should pay attention to safety and report those with suspicion in a timely manner. During this period, try not to go anywhere outside of school and home.\u201dNina nodded, but then she let out an \u201cah\u201d exclaiming sound like she just remembered something: \u201cBut\u2026 But I already made an appointment with my classmates to visit the museum in two days\u2026\u201d\u201cMuseum?\u201d Duncan casually asked, \u201cWhat museum?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the Oceanographic Museum near school at the edge of the upper sector,\u201d Nina explains, \u201cand I\u2019ve heard that there\u2019s been recent exhibits of offshore mineral specimens\u2026 Is it okay?\u201d\u201cGo if you want,\u201d Duncan thought for a moment before nodding his head, \u201csince there are patrols of church guards and city-state police everywhere, those cultists will not be bold enough to jump out in the next two days.\u201dNina nodded happily, \u201cMmm!\u201d\u201cAre you going to school in the afternoon?\u201d Duncan asked again.\u201cMhmm, the afternoon is history and I don\u2019t want to miss Mr. Morris\u2019s class,\u201d Nina nodded, \u201che\u2019s a very famous expert in the field of history\u2026 But it is strange though that an old gentleman as famous as him isn\u2019t lecturing at the university in the upper sector. Most students here in the public school don\u2019t like history to begin with. They\u2019re always asleep during his lectures\u2026\u201dDuncan shook his head calmly, \u201cI can\u2019t answer you that.\u201dDon\u2019t joke around. Ignoring the part about Mr. Morris who teaches history, even Nina had only just come into his life so where would he get that information? What\u2019s more, the memory fragment from the body definitely didn\u2019t have anything either. A sick ailing cultist wouldn\u2019t care about anything aside from keeping himself alive.Nina still had classes to attend in the afternoon so she didn\u2019t stay in the antique shop for long after lunch. After hurriedly packing up her things, the girl merrily trotted out of home and made the trip for school on foot through the cobbled streets.From the antique shop to school takes about an hour of time. If she goes at her pace, the girl should make it without being late.Of course, there\u2019s the public transport in the city along the streets that everyone could ride \u2013 a streetcar powered by steam-engine. Unfortunately, six pesos for a ticket was a price beyond the means of a lowly student without a job.The excuse Nina made to Duncan was that it\u2019s better to run since it\u2019s better for her health. However, Duncan knew that\u2019s not true and even thought about buying a bike for her. It\u2019s something he saw a lot of people ride during his outing to the news stand.In a society that has developed steam machinery, the industrial product of the bicycle wasn\u2019t too expensive for ordinary folks to afford. Nevertheless, it\u2019s definitely not cheap for the residents of the lower sector where most of their wages goes into their daily expenses.Duncan didn\u2019t know where the identity he currently occupied would go in the future, but watching Nina trot all the way down the street corner, what\u2019s the word, a desire to be kinder to this girl.He didn\u2019t know why he had this desire, perhaps it\u2019s for the previous vegetable soup and salty pancakes, but it would pain him to see such a kind and diligent student lose her way in life.I should start thinking up a way to earn money in this city-state.With all sorts of thoughts swirling in his mind, Duncan put the newspaper in his hand down and slowly paced to the end of the second-floor corridor. Through the open window, he stared off into the city streets in a somewhat dazed state of contemplation.In this world, \u201cabnormalities\u201d and \u201cvisions\u201d have long become a coexistence for civilization. Neither the church nor authorities have hidden this fact from the people\u2019s affairs.Take Nina for example. As a high school student, even she would have access to the information about the supernatural, and not the simple surface stuff either. Sure, the knowledge didn\u2019t involve everything, but it\u2019s not too far off either like the list of anomalies and visions.Duncan lifted his head and stared silently at the sky at the thought of the list.Vision 001, Sun.The giant body of light moving in the sky that came into existence after the collapse of the ancient kingdom of Crete.The sphere of influence is infinite, stretching across the whole world while being unmanned in its operations. Humans can\u2019t touch it. Nevertheless, it operates within the bounds of what is described as a vision.According to historical records, on the day of the collapse of the ancient kingdom, the sea raged as the city-states were shattered, and all the core members of the first dynasty died heroically in the darkness with their blood soaked into the sea. From then on came Vision 001 that rose from the ending of one dynasty to the next, but also the rising of a new era in a world of darkness.The ancient kingdom of Crete, the first city-state civilization established by survivors after the beginning of the Deep Sea Age, lasted only a hundred years, but left also countless legacies behind as a blessing to their descendants.The word \u201cCrete\u201d meant \u201ceternal night\u201d in the ancient language.It was a night that lasted for a century.All of this was written in Nina\u2019s history textbook.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

With the \u201cGreat Annihilation\u201d as the node, even the fundamental laws of the world were distorted in the following tide. Therefore, the Era of Order before that could be regarded as two completely different \u201cworlds\u201d.But even so, there will always be those persistent few who try to sort through the historical materials passed down through the ages. Sadly, try as they might, the fragmentation had been too extensive to the point it\u2019s near impossible to reorganize the truth from the false. At this point, no one knows what the world was like in the Age of Order.Fortunately, not all was lost. Since the ancient kingdom of Crete, record keeping has been relatively well maintained. Although city-states rose and fell throughout the ages, civilization continued to thrive with the linking chain never broken. To credit this feat, many scholars looked to the miracle currently illuminating the sky, also known as Vision 001 (sun).This was the biggest known vision to influence humanity thus far. In reality, many scholars have debated whether the sun was actually a vision or a natural phenomenon due to its size and perpetual existence. But since the survivors of the ancient kingdom of Crete referred to the sun as Vision 001, the naming stuck and has not changed.Obviously, not all visions are terrible and harmful, and vision 001 has brought security to the world for at least half the day, with anything below sea level suppressed by the light. It\u2019s through this suppression that civilization has managed to develop to this day.According to the information left by the ancient kingdom of Crete, after the opening of the Deep Sea Age and the century before the appearance of Vision 001, the whole world had been enveloped by night, illuminated only by the dim glow from the \u201cWorld Creation\u201d in the sky. As a result, there\u2019s also another name for that ancient kingdom \u2013 the kingdom of Eternal Night. It\u2019s a name representing the environment they had to live in.Duncan stood before the narrow window and stared thoughtfully at the world under the sun.The world before the Great Annihilation\u2026 What exactly is it like?Did the sun shine on all things in this world before the century-long night?Most likely a yes. No matter how many inconsistencies and contradictions the city-states have in the ancient records, one thing is common in their description: the Age of Order is a bright, safe, and prosperous era.But in any case, that prosperous and bright period has passed, and the vast sea of today is illuminated by Vision 001, which is known to the world as the light source during the day.That makes a lot of sense then if what I suspect is true. It\u2019s likely the reason why those Black Sun cultists are so despised by the public \u2013 calling the \u201cfalse sun\u201d some blasphemy thing when it\u2019s giving the only light to the world. It\u2019s no wonder the public wouldn\u2019t tolerate their existence. It\u2019s the same as attacking civilization.In a way, those cultists are poor souls abandoned by the times. If the circumstances are different, they would be the ones in the right.Naturally, pity was one thing. Duncan wouldn\u2019t be delusional enough to think their ambitions could be realized at all, nor did he think some sacrifice would truly bring about the burning of a fusion star upon this world. After all, there was not a single star up in the night sky when he last checked. This world was clearly separated from what he knows as outer space.Duncan returned to his room, closed the door, and beckoned Ai to come down from the cabinet.\u201cWho is calling the fleet?\u201d The dove chirps after landing on his shoulder.Instead of ignoring the bird, Duncan went over to the bed and found the sun emblem he had hidden in the corner. Then after another thought, he came up to the drawer where the spirits were stored and took out two bottles \u2013 something attached to the underside.\u201cDrink less.\u201d It\u2019s Nina\u2019s handwriting on the note, and it appears to be posted a long time ago.Duncan faintly smiled at the message and closed the drawers behind himself. It never worked before on the real Ron so of course it won\u2019t work now with Duncan.\u201cIf you can, try to bring them to the Vanished.\u201d He said to the dove and displayed the items in his hands to the bird.Ai immediately flapped its wings and made a proud chirp: \u201cFedex free shipping!\u201dDuncan nodded, allowing himself to lie down in a comfortable position before going back.He had been away from the Vanished for too long. Although nothing should happen to that ship without his attention, but he\u2019s the captain. It wouldn\u2019t look good if he kept locking himself in his room.Besides, there\u2019s nothing Duncan needs to do on this side for now. Nina had left for school, and she had other plans already after class. On top of that, they had discussed it and that she would stay in the dormitory for another night.With such an opening, it\u2019s perfect for him to test his theories of shuttling items through the spirit world and controlling both bodies. The latter should be feasible according to his own perception.Duncan softly inhaled and readied himself. First came a wisp of green flame burning around his shoulder, then with a crackling sound, Ai transformed into her undead bird form and popped open the compass lid hanging around her neck.The familiar sensations flooded into Duncan\u2019s mind like always \u2013 twinkling starlight and the speeding through of his mind in the space tunnel \u2013 and before he knew it, he had found his consciousness descending upon the Vanished in the captain\u2019s room.But before he makes contact, Duncan did as he has planned and forces a \u201cbrake\u201d on his ghost fire, effectively preserving a part of his mind on the body inside the antique shop\u2026.Meanwhile in the captain\u2019s bedroom, his main body had slowly opened its eyes and examined the room. It\u2019s the familiar furnishings of the ship and the battering of the waves against the ship\u2019s hull like he remembered.Slowly pulling himself up from the chair, he touched his body, and instead of only feeling one body, he got the sensation of two at once!This outcome slowly drew a smile on Duncan\u2019s face. Like he thought. He can now split his focus and control the second remotely using a single mind.Not waiting, he promptly took this newfound ability for a test drive.On the second floor of Duncan\u2019s antique shop in the city-state of Pland, the \u201cantique shopkeeper\u201d who was lying quietly on the bed when he suddenly shot open its eyes!The expression remained a little stiff, like a zombie observing the room from side to side, but sure enough, he was able to manipulate his arms and legs like a rusty machine.If this scene was seen by some outsiders, it would surely frighten them silly and call the city police, saying there\u2019s a man possessed by evil spirits.Then again, such a claim wasn\u2019t wrong!Duncan had a tough time physically moving the remote body there, but after many attempts, he finally managed to sit up from the bed!But the next second, the distant picture in his mind suddenly started to spin wildly because he had fallen to the floor\u2026Duncan sighed, \u201cWell, it looks like I\u2019ll have to practice for a while longer.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

At the same time though, it\u2019s also an extremely difficult challenge for him.From a certain perspective, Duncan believes he can\u2019t be called a normal person anymore. Even so, it doesn\u2019t mean the feat didn\u2019t come without burden. After half a day of struggling and tossing around, he eventually managed to barely crawl the second body inside the antique shop back onto the bed.But judging by the feedback from the depths of his consciousness, mastering this dual-minded skill wouldn\u2019t be too far off. After that, it\u2019s only a matter of time and familiarization until he\u2019s comfortable doing this daily.After setting things in order and leaving a sliver of his attention inside the antique shop, Duncan finally breathed a sigh of relief. It\u2019s his first point of contact with human civilization. Losing such a significant base of operation would severely put him back.\u201cSuccessful transmission!\u201d Exactly then, a series of flapping wings came from the side. Ai had returned with a proud look on her chest as she landed on the table \u2013 there was also the pale gold sun emblem and two bottles of spirits she had brought back.A smile slowly crept onto Duncan\u2019s face, followed by a broad grin at what this implied.Feasible! It is feasible to let this bird carry \u201ccargo\u201d between the spirit world! On top of that, it\u2019s not limited to ordinary items either!With a satisfied mood, he got up and took the items to check each and every one of them for any weirdness. The sun emblem still carried the faint power he inserted before, and the two bottles of spirits were blessings to his nose once he popped the corks.Smirking like an idiot, Duncan glanced down at Ai who had already begun to pace around on the table.Efficient, quality, and free shipping \u2013 I\u2019m starting to love this nagging dove.The pigeon also noticed the \u201cmaster\u2019s\u201d gaze and immediately trotted up to Duncan\u2019s side, pecking at the table with its beak and shouting: \u201cFriend fries! Make some French fries!\u201d\u201cThere are no fries on board for the time being, but I don\u2019t think it will be a problem very soon,\u201d Duncan happily lifted the bird up with his hand and met those mung bean-sized eyes, \u201cI wonder what the upper limit of your ability is? Is it limited to inanimate objects? And what about lost baggage? Do you lose baggage? Guess we will need to test this some more\u2026\u201dThe bird thought for a moment and leaned back on his neck: \u201cLost bag? Oops, page is missing\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 Shhh, that\u2019s what I\u2019m afraid of, your name always gives me a sense of unreliability.\u201d Duncan\u2019s confidence sizzled out a bit after hearing that last remark. The success of the first trial run had him all riled up, but Ai\u2019s constant illogical chirping did not give anyone comfort. At the very least, he won\u2019t be at ease until he gives this \u201csupply line\u201d several attempts.With a plan for the next step in mind, Duncan got up from his chair and walked to the door leading into the mapping room. However, he stopped just shy of the door knob as he flexed his limbs and muscles. After confirming he had full control of everything without any sluggishness or exhaustion, he found his body no different from when he first left it.Is this also the special power of \u201cCaptain Duncan\u201d? Or is it\u2026 because I\u2019m in essence half a ghost now? I won\u2019t get tired?He pondered this possibility but found no indicating evidence to back up this theory. But in any case, this does not seem to be a bad thing. This body didn\u2019t need much \u201cmaintenance\u201d, meaning he could more safely divide part of his energy into other aspects of life.Duncan was a very frank person, or rather, he was very good at putting aside the mysteries that had not been solved for the time being. After thinking it through, he reached out and twisted the doorknob for good and stepped into the neighboring mapping room.Captain Duncan has returned.\u201cName?\u201d The goat head rigidly asks using that hollow gaze.\u201cCaptain Duncan,\u201d Duncan glanced at the wooden statue, \u201cI\u2019m back.\u201d\u201cAh! The great Captain Duncan is back on his loyal and magnificent Vanished! Sorry Captain, you have been spirit walking for a while so I needed to confirm it again\u2026 After all, this is the rule you set yourself. How do you feel? What\u2019s your mood? How is the body? What was the harvest for this long spirit walk? Did you find something interesting? Would you like to share this trip with your loyal first mate? Have you noticed I omitted my other titles? Miss Alice said this would make things more streamlined and that you might prefer this arrangement\u2026.\u201d\u201cShut up, your little streamlining got ruined by that crapload of nonsense before the last bit.\u201d Duncan waved dismissively at the goat head, \u201cWhat happened while I was away from the ship?\u201d\u201cAh, Captain Duncan\u2019s sternness and humor are as always. The ship is well, with everything perfectly in order. I, your most loyal first mate, have done as your entrusted in steering the ship. In addition, Miss Alice had visited twice, but neither was a big deal. One was about the ropes, the other about the anchor\u2026.\u201dDuncan had intended to go check up on deck when he heard the goat head\u2019s report. With a question mark over his head: \u201cWhy is she fighting with ropes and anchor?\u201dThe part about Alice running around exploring the ship did appear on his radar during the spirit walk, but he didn\u2019t expect it to be so lively to warrant a note.\u201cOh, the truth is Miss Alice did it out of kindness,\u201d replied the goat head at once, \u201cshe thinks it is very bad to have nothing to do on the ship so she wanted to help \u2013 like tidying up the ropes and maintaining the anchor is what she came up with. However, I forgot to tell her the cables are ticklish while the anchor needs a nap\u2026.\u201dDuncan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cCaptain, are you angry?\u201d Duncan\u2019s sudden silence made the goat head tense up. Shaking its head back and forth, \u201cActually, it is no big deal if I might add. All new crew members need time mingling with the old sailors aboard. Right now they\u2019re currently in the fighting phase. Once that\u2019s past, the progress she will make in integrating will be superb. In fact, she\u2019s quite popular aboard with the others\u2026\u201dHalfway through the goat head\u2019s defense, a series of rushed footsteps interjected, followed by the loud banging of the door with Alice running in: \u201cMr. Goathead, why are the shells in the ammunition room rolling around and not letting me\u2026\u201dDuncan shot a silent look at Alice, who had spotted the ghost captain with her awkward, stiff posture.\u201cFine, this is the third time,\u201d sighed the goat head on the mapping table, \u201cthis time she is fighting with the cannon shells\u2026 I admit that Miss Alice\u2019s run-in on the ship may have been a little too lively\u2026\u201dAlice shrunk her neck (probably reinforcing the joints) and looked nervously at Duncan, \u201cCaptain, you\u2019re back\u2026\u201d\u201cMhmm,\u201d Duncan nodded with a calm face, \u201cit looks like you had a good time on the ship when I wasn\u2019t around?\u201dAlice: \u201c\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although she likes to surf the waves with her wooden casket box and talk a lot of nonsense, the positive outweighs the negative. But now, the idea of her staying put and acting like a doll no longer seemed possible.\u201cCaptain, you are not angry, are you? I can explain\u2026\u201dThe sudden low atmosphere in the room made Alice feel a little nervous as she carefully glanced at the expressionless Duncan.\u201cI know you\u2019re helping, merely unsuccessful,\u201d Duncan looked at Miss Doll with a somewhat helpless face, \u201cbut since you also know that a lot of things on this ship are \u2018alive\u2019, can you confirm it with me or my first mate beforehand the next time you want to do something?\u201dAlice immediately nodded her head and loudly agreed, \u201cOkay Captain, no problem Captain!\u201dThen she immediately turned her attention to the goat head and muttered in a low voice, \u201cIs there such a thing as unsuccessful in helping?\u201dThe goat head said in a rare and concise way: \u201cNow there is.\u201d\u201cOkay, if you really want to help, go check the dried fish hanging on the deck, or go to the kitchen to tidy up the ingredients in storage to make space. In the future, we may have the opportunity to replenish the food on the Vanished,\u201d Duncan sighed and said this to Alice, \u201cLeave the artillery and ammunition alone below deck. They don\u2019t have the same full intelligence as my first mate, and those dangerous things will only respond instinctively to external stimuli. In any case, I don\u2019t want those cannonballs suddenly blowing up thinking they\u2019re being attacked by mistake. If they do, I can only sweep you back together with the broom and dustpan.\u201dWhen Alice heard this, her neck promptly shrunk as she promised not to do it anymore before fleeing the room. This made Duncan chuckle a small laugh because things were getting more interesting. Instead of a dead and lifeless ship, he\u2019s now got a doll to liven things up. A proper home per say.\u201cFrom the looks of it your mood is quite good, Captain.\u201d The goat head spoke from the side again, \u201cAh, you have something in your hand\u2026 What is that? Is it the harvest of your spirit walk? Like that knife last time?\u201dDuncan glanced at the sun emblem he was holding and displayed it for the goat head to see. He had left the spirits in his room and was planning to study this item here.\u201cIt\u2019s booty,\u201d he nodded, \u201cjust like the ritual knife last time.\u201d\u201cOh! As expected of the great Captain Duncan! You always manage to return with a full load of booty, and an extraordinary item with wonderful power at that\u2026 Hold on, is that a sun amulet?\u201d\u201cDo you know this thing?\u201d Duncan raised his eyebrows, \u201cThat\u2019s right, sun amulet, a few daring cultists stuffed this thing onto me so it was hard for me to reject their graciousness.\u201d\u201cI\u2026 I know a little\u2026\u201d The goat head seemed to be wary of the emblem because he started hesitating, \u201cThe madmen who follows the ancient sun regards this object as a holy relic. They believe that casting metal into the shape of the real sun and quenching it with human blood could infuse the power of the sun into the runes, and through this method, it is possible to mass-produce supernatural items with diminished effects\u2026 This amulet is a status symbol for those sun followers. It can also be used to identify their fellow brethren to avoid heretics from sneaking into their ranks\u2026\u201d\u201cTo distinguish between fellow believers and heretics eh\u2026 There is indeed such a feature,\u201d Duncan understood now, \u201cAlthough I personally feel that this feature is of little use.\u201d\u201cWhat happened to those daring cultists?\u201d The goat head seemed to grow worried when he said this, \u201cMost of them are paranoid and ignorant fanatics, and even the worst pirates are not willing to deal with such fanatics who chase after ancient things. If they dare to offend\u2026\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re no longer in this world,\u201d Duncan said, controlling his expression as he watched the goat head\u2019s tone change, \u201cand it seems that you don\u2019t like these people who call themselves \u2018Sun Believers\u2019, do you?\u201dAfter dealing with the goat head for such a long time, Duncan has actually roughly figured out the behavior of this strange \u201cfirst mate\u201d. So long as he\u2019s in charge of the ship, the odds of the wooden statue committing mutiny would not exist, hence his increasing confidence in doing as he pleases.\u201cWho would like crazy people who follow the real sun of ancient times? The \u2018light\u2019 and \u2018order\u2019 they aspire to have long since ceased to be tolerated by this world.\u201d The goat head answered Duncan\u2019s question as usual, \u201cEverything in this era is bathed in the sunlight of this era, the Vanished is so, and the demons lurking in the deep sea are so as well. Nothing, perhaps aside from those cultists, will want to resurrect that real sun at this day and age\u2026\u201dSpeaking of this, the goat head suddenly paused before speaking with a hint of emotion: \u201cBut then again, ninety-nine percent of those cultists are actually just a bunch of brainwashed fools. They don\u2019t even know what they are following and worshiping. They regard the so-called \u2018sun heirs\u2019 as prophets and saviors, and the ancient world described by those heirs are to them kingdoms of the heaven. But in my opinion, the sun heirs do not treat those fanatical believers as people\u2026 They are no different from heirs from the Deep Sea.\u201dHeirs of the sun? What does that mean? And from the sounds of it, there\u2019s also heirs of the Deep Sea? What is that?!Duncan\u2019s heart revved with astonishment at the new word he had just heard. Fiddling with the sun emblem in his hand, he pretends to remain frank and unfazed despite giddy with excitement: \u201cSun heir? I didn\u2019t meet them during my spirit walk.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s normal. The heirs of the sun would not dare to make an appearance in the civilized world. Even if they disguised themselves as human beings, the hyenas of the Storm Church would pick up the stench of heresy from their shadows in no time. In the end, they\u2019re all just heirs. As the residue of the ancient past, those heirs should behave and stay in the gutters of history. Alas, the sun heirs are the most troublesome bunch of all the types out there.\u201dFor the first time ever, Duncan suddenly discovered it\u2019s not so bad to have a nagging goat head statue around. Sure, the yapping could get annoying fast, but the occasional useful information was nothing to scoff at!After some further roundabout \u201cinquiry\u201d of the goat head, Duncan quickly grasped onto many new information he didn\u2019t get from the city-state of Pland.There seems to be another type of creature in this world called \u201cheirs\u201d, and none are tolerated by civilization as a whole due to them being remnants of the ancient past.Although the number of believers who worship the \u201creal sun god\u201d was huge, it sounds like most are just insignificant pawns brainwashed by their ignorance. Meanwhile, the real ruling class of this cult are in fact the so-called sun heirs. They are the masterminds of all those crimes, remotely controlling the act from some far-off place unknown to the world. The purpose? Collecting energy by making sacrifices.Lastly, and most important for Duncan at this time: the goat head had complete contempt for those cultists and sun heirs masterminding everything from the shadows.So what does this imply? Simple. The Vanished, or \u201cthe real Captain Duncan\u201d, and these guys who called themselves \u201cheirs\u201d are not in the same camp\u2026 It should even be counted as hostile.Going by all these points, Duncan was fairly sure his decision to tell the goat head his encounter with the sun cultists a smart move. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t have found out all these things since Nina\u2019s textbooks didn\u2019t contain this knowledge.Eventually, Duncan had left the captain\u2019s room and started strolling around the deck in deep thought.So these heirs are likely products dating back to the Age of Order if what the goat head said is true. The surface world has the sun heirs, and the deep sea has its own heirs as well\u2026.Without realizing it, he had unconsciously walked up to the side of the ship where he\u2019s confronted with the open blue sea.The ocean\u2026. Isn\u2019t just filled with fishes?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 55": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Deep Sea EmbersCH 54Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 54 \u201cThe Underground Church\u201dThis Translation is hosted on https://bcatranslation.com/In the end, Duncan didn\u2019t figure out what an \u201cheir\u201d was.The goat head remained vague about this aspect, and it seems that it does not know the details of these ancient things that roamed at the edge of the civilized world either. As for Duncan, he could only summarize a few concepts due to the limited number of clues.As products of ancient times, they hated the modern world and had strange and dangerous powers while hiding in the shadows. Except for the children of the sun, other \u201cheirs\u201d would seldom appear in the civilized world while remaining a threat to those who explored the borders.And in all this intelligence, there\u2019s another fascinating point: the heirs of the sun seem to be able to disguise themselves as human beings, and only the transcendents of the Church could distinguish the children of the sun from ordinary folks.Thinking of the recent changes in the city-state of Pland and the resurgence of sun believers who got all active, Duncan had no choice but to suspect the worst.Behind the high-profile activities of the cultists\u2026 were they ordered by an heir? What are those ancient and strange beings trying to do in the city-state of Pland?Standing at the edge of the deck, he stared down at the turbulent sea that was housing the other heirs beneath his feet. They\u2019re also ancient beings threatening the crossing of ships on these waters.Without a doubt, Duncan was both wary and curious about these deep-sea things.He believes that although he has not dealt with these things yet, he would eventually encounter these strange creatures sooner or later so long as the Vanished continued to wander the sea. Therefore, it wouldn\u2019t hurt to make preparations beforehand.Whether it was gathering intelligence or further developing his own powers like unearthing the potential of the Vanished, arrangements must be made for the future.Of course, he was not afraid of the dangers lurking in the deep sea; after all, nothing\u2019s happened yet after drifting on water for so long. He could more or less guess the heirs were just one of the countless strange threats lurking in the dark.He pondered on the deck for a much longer this time and found that the most important thing he needed to worry about now was whether the \u201csupply channels\u201d would be affected\u2014those deep-sea heirs would not affect his fishing, right?Although the pigeon Ai has the ability to transport supplies, it was not yet possible to determine its carrying capacity and reliability. Not to mention the city-state of Pland was an orderly place, meaning he had to pay for the supplies out of his own pocket instead of pillaging from another ship. Who knows when he could secure the needed funds?Coupled with the abundant hunting in front of him the last time he fished, Duncan knew very well that the living improvement of the Vanished was ultimately inseparable from the gifts of nature.If those \u201cheirs\u201d do get nasty, they might actually start affecting my harvest.\u2026\u2026The bright gas lamps radiating light expelled the darkness of the church\u2019s underground facilities, and the deep-sea runes inscribed in the long corridors exuded reassuring power to those walking its halls. They\u2019re the main source of protection for the clerics here, an invisible giant net of sacred blessing from their goddess.Vanna was quite fond of walking through the hallways because the serene atmosphere always brought her mood up. As an inquisitor of the faith, she knows all too well Goddess Gomona didn\u2019t only preside over the torrential storm as her domain but also the power of peace and calm in sealing away evil.Just as there are different faces of the sea, peace and storm are just two mirror images of one coin. This could be seen in how the church had been constructed here \u2013 the surface level represented the storm, while the underground represented the calm and serenity.Of course, there are other gods in this world with two different characteristics as well. Take the God of Death Bart\u00f3k, who also wielded the power of life, or the god of Intelligence, who also represented foolishness. Ordinary folks may not always know about this aspect, but high-ranking priests and officials definitely do. As an inquisitor, Vanna had extensive knowledge in this area.On top of that, she also knew because of the two-sided nature of many gods, highly controversial and even near-heretical ideas had been spawned over the years. Scholars claimed that the world was two-sided \u2013 that in a certain dimension, there was a \u201cbarren world\u201d where the sea and the land were completely mirrored.These outrageous speculations are of course based entirely on conjecture and wouldn\u2019t be recognized by the public. Even the famed Bishop of Pland, Mr. Valentine, had scoffed at the idea when he heard this.In the old man\u2019s original words, it\u2019s enough of a headache that there\u2019s a subspace at the bottom of the world. Those folk theologians should stop hanging more stuff below the subspace.Vanna suddenly shook her head, letting that uncontrolled head to refocus again.Beneath the quiet cathedral, the human mind could easily get distracted by other thoughts because of how overly peaceful it was. This effect reached everyone, including well-trained clerics of the church.But on the other hand, this special environment did have its uses.For example, having some fanatical and crazy cultists speak during interrogation.Coming to a stop at the end of the hallway, Vanna was now faced with several doors leading into various \u201cinterrogation rooms\u201d, while a statue of the Storm Lady stood quietly in the foyer between the entrances.This statue was different from the one above the surface. The main lobby one had her hands opened wide like it was accepting the prayers of all; meanwhile, the one underground had her hands folded into her chest, quiet and gentle like she was here to listen to the woes of its visitors. But no matter which statue it was, the face remained covered with a light veil \u2013 this symbolizes the unknowability of the gods.This version was known as the Maiden of Tranquility, the other side of the Storm Goddess. She suppresses the bodies of water below the surface and shelters the tranquility of the city-state\u2019s.Vanna respectfully bowed in front of the Tranquility Maiden, then turned and pushed open the door of a nearby interrogation room to shatter the silence.The inside was a spacious but dimly lit room with a large table at the center. In here, Ms. Heidi \u2013 dressed in her skin-tight long black dress \u2013 was just getting up when Vanna entered. Meanwhile, opposite to the doctor, a sun heretic remained quietly seated in the chair with restraints.Then again, restraints were no longer necessary since the captive looked like his soul had been sucked out from the interrogation. Those disorientated eyes, the limp body leaning against the handrail, there\u2019s hardly any sign of strength left in that flesh, only an empty husk of whatever the person was before losing his way.\u201cOh, Inquisitor, you have come just in time,\u201d Ms. Heidi greets her fellow lady with a smile, \u201cI have just finished with a \u2018course\u2019.\u201dVanna\u2019s eyes shifted over to Ms. Heidi\u2019s medical kit \u2013 which had a lot of needles and various scary looking tools found only in surgical rooms \u2013 and couldn\u2019t keep her expression from twitching: \u201cSeriously, I still have a hard time associating your sessions as \u2018treatment\u2019\u2026\u201d\u201cThese are the standard tools of us psychiatrists\u2026 Alright, I admit that I probably use them more often than the average doctor,\u201d said Ms. Heidi with a shrug. \u201cBut can you blame me? I\u2019m employed by city hall and would often be called upon by the church. The \u2018patients\u2019 I see are never normal people, especially these cultists. Some swinging crystal and hypnosis wouldn\u2019t work unless I dose them with three times the amount of \u2018midnight mixture\u2019.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 I suspect that the reason you inject three times the dosage is because the biggest syringe in your kit can only hold that much,\u201d Vanna spat out what she thought without holding back. Shaking her head again to get back on business, \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t matter as long as you can pry open their mouths\u2026 tell me, what did you get?\u201d\u201cYes, and the harvest is not small and strange,\u201d Ms. Heidi replied immediately, \u201cI have heavily hypnotized several cultists and used some special means to confirm one thing\u2026. It is highly likely that these cultists who participated in the sacrifice ritual did not go crazy after the ceremony got out of control\u2026\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t go crazy after losing control?\u201d Vanna frowned at once. Although she knew after talking to Bishop Valentine that the complexity of the matter would exceed expectations, but Heidi\u2019s words still exceeded her expectations, \u201cWhat does this mean?\u201d\u201cI searched their memories and found the minds of these people\u2026 Or cognitive logic, had been damaged from an external force even before the failed ritual. The effects had them filter out certain aspects of their memories\u2026 Hmm? Inquisitor Vanna, you don\u2019t seem to be surprised at all?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The mental problems you found in these cultists must\u2019ve happened to each of us as well, but\u2026 thanks to the goddess\u2019s protection, we were able to avoid being deeply polluted. It\u2019s the main reason we could wake up from it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 Damn, I knew sooner or later this kind of thing would happen to me,\u201d Heidi finally stopped packing the medical kit and facepalmed herself. \u201cI really should have listened to my father\u2019s advice to inherit his career as an antique appraiser or perhaps listen to my mother\u2019s advice and become a history teacher in the local public school\u2026. That\u2019s far safer than dealing with cultists.\u201d\u201cRelax, at least your job now is enough to give you a decent living standard in the upper parts of the city,\u201d Vanna shook her head disapprovingly that this life was bad. Compared to her usual uptight attitude, the inquisitor\u2019s tone was far more approachable to Heidi since they\u2019re so close of age and have been friends for many years. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we discuss your findings instead? Perhaps that will help the church and city hall grasp the situation better.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 It\u2019s actually quite simple, an obvious violation of the norm,\u201d Heidi sighed as she explained the clues she dug out of the cultists\u2019 subconscious. \u201cOn the ritual night, a sacrifice got out of control in front of the sun totem and turned things around on the priest. But according to the many clues we found on the scene, the \u201csacrifice\u2019 was actually a \u2018corpse\u2019 that had already been killed, am I right?\u201dVanna nodded, \u201cThat\u2019s right, I remember it well.\u201d\u201cThen the problem comes\u2026 Since this sacrifice had already been sacrificed once, why didn\u2019t any of the cultists at the scene recognize him? Why didn\u2019t even the priest himself recognize the sacrifice in front of him?\u201dVanna slowly frowned at the contradiction, \u201c\u2026 The cultists at the scene watched as the sacrifice that had been killed once not long ago reappeared in front of their eyes, yet no one noticed the abnormality\u2026 Clearly, their memories had been tampered with and their cognition distorted beforehand.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right Vanna, even we didn\u2019t notice this obvious contradiction at the time, did we?\u201d Heidi smiled bitterly and spread her hands, \u201cIn fact, even an hour ago, I didn\u2019t realize that I had taken this matter for granted until you brought it up just now.\u201dVanna didn\u2019t speak for a moment, then turned around and came to the cultist, who was still in a state of confusion due to the double large dosage of neurodrugs and powerful incense.Vanna suddenly swung back and asked, \u201cAre these cultists hacking and slashing each other after the ritual the results of their cognitive confusion too?\u201d\u201cYes, I \u2018saw\u2019 some flickering images in their memories,\u201d Heidi replied, \u201cand these images seem to imprint a very strong impression on them, convincing them that everyone else at the ceremony scene is possessed and controlled by evil spirits or something similar. They do not think they are slashing and killing their compatriots, but that they are expelling the evil spirits in the bodies of other compatriots\u2026\u201d\u201cThis is mostly a warning from their souls \u2013 cultists are also believers, and there is a dark sun to \u2018bless\u2019 them from the rear. When a huge and strange danger appears, these blessings are very likely to perceive something,\u201d Vanna analyzed empirically, \u201cHence, their crazy illusions had more or less revealed the truth. Still, unfortunately, these untrained ordinary folks did not know the meaning behind the warnings. It\u2019s how they fell into collective madness.\u201dHeidi looked at Vana with a severe face, and after a few hesitations, she finally opened her mouth cautiously: \u201cSo\u2026 what\u2019s behind this? Is it something more evil than the ancient sun?\u201dVanna thought for a moment and shook her head slightly, \u201cDon\u2019t inquire, Heidi, your connection with this matter is not deep, but if you dig it further, some irrevocable ties will probably be established as a result.\u201d\u201cWell, since you say so. I value my life a lot so I will trust in your judgment,\u201d Heidi said, picking up the medical kit that had been packed. \u201cI really want to give myself a holiday\u2026 Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not running. In two days, the Oceanographic Museum will have an exhibition. I am quite interested in what they have on display.\u201dVanna nodded, \u201cA visit to the Oceanographic Museum is a great way to relax, and the blessings of the goddess are also filled in with those exhibits.\u201dHeidi smiled and walked to the door, but just as she was about to push her way out, she suddenly stopped and swung back at Vanna uneasily: \u201cI say\u2026 has the pollution really subsided?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, of course it has subsided,\u201d Vanna waved her hand helplessly, \u201cwe only got caught up in some \u2018residual\u2019 remnant. You\u2019ve been in the underground church for so long. Any corrupt influence would\u2019ve been cleansed by now from the goddess\u2019s power.\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019m relieved,\u201d Heidi breathed a sigh of relief and finally stepped through the exit, \u201cthen see you next time, Inquisitor Vanna.\u201dVanna watched as her friend gradually left the room, leaving only herself and the sun heretic inside the interrogation room muddled by the scent of incense and nerve potions. However, unbeknownst to the strong and faithful inquisitor, her current image reflected in the eye of the cultist wasn\u2019t so holy at the moment. Standing behind Vanna\u2019s tall figure, a hazy and almost transparent illusion with a fiery green flame was burning overhead, giving the lady a near sinister look.\u2026\u2026Duncan sat expressionlessly in the mapping room as he watched Alice the doll in front of himself \u2013 she had brought a tray of bright cutlery and a large bowl of steaming soup.It smells like fish soup.Apparently, after gaining a better familiarity with the environment aboard the Vanished, Miss Doll here had come up with a new idea to \u201cdo something for the captain in her own way\u201d.\u201cDinner?\u201d Duncan observed the doll curiously while also eyeing the arrangement on his table, \u201cHow did you suddenly come up with doing this?\u201d\u201cI was finishing up cleaning the kitchen storehouse when I saw the bucket of\u2026 \u201cfish,\u201d Alice smiled and looked proud, \u201cI can\u2019t help with a lot of work on the ship, but cooking should always be OK. So from now on, I can take care of the cooking.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s good to have this heart,\u201d Duncan didn\u2019t know how to evaluate this strange doll. It\u2019s just that in the face of Alice\u2019s sincere smile, he had no courage to refuse the kindness and discourage her enthusiasm. \u201cBut as a doll, do you know how to cook?\u201d\u201cI can learn it. It feels quite simple,\u201d Alice said as a matter of course. \u201cThe most basic thing is to ask Mr. Goathead. He told me a lot of cooking things before\u2026\u201dDuncan glanced expressionlessly at the goat head next to him and then at Alice.A wood carving, a doll of unknown material, and now they dare to study the art of cooking when the two didn\u2019t even have a digestive system? Just listening to them was frightening.He didn\u2019t know what mood fitted the situation, but he just picked up the soup spoon and stirred the fish in the bowl.At least this thing smelled right\u2026.But the next second, his hands froze at the sighting of a long silvery-white hair hanging off the spoon.\u201cYour hair has fallen in,\u201d Duncan said expressionlessly.\u201cAh, I didn\u2019t drop my hair in it,\u201d Alice immediately waved her hand, \u201cI dropped my head in\u2026 But don\u2019t worry, I caught it immediately, and I didn\u2019t need anyone to help!\u201dDuncan: \u201c\u2026?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This couldn\u2019t be called a misgiving anymore but a step into the realm of curses and death sentences.Looking slightly hurt at the spoon being placed back down, Miss Doll anxiously grabbed the side of her skirt with both hands and asked: \u201cCaptain, are you angry?\u201dDuncan watched the doll exhaustedly, \u201cIf you are unhappy about something on the ship, you can tell me directly\u2026\u201d\u201cHuh? I\u2019m not\u2026\u201d\u201cIn that case, try not to go into the kitchen in the future\u2026\u201d Duncan said casually but soon noticed Alice\u2019s increasingly frustrated expression. Quickly changing his words after shaking that head, \u201cForget it, your starting point is good. In fact, I am very happy for you. But cooking\u2026 If you are not skilled, you will have some kind of accident. Take it slow and get familiar with everything first.\u201dAlice immediately perked up, \u201cThen I can try again later?\u201dDuncan held his breath for the longest time before finally nodding, \u201cJust pay attention\u2026.\u201dHe also thought about it: the cursed doll obviously couldn\u2019t stand the status quo of loafing around on the Vanished. Perhaps she really had some kind of \u201cnatural characteristic\u201d that compelled her to do something on the ship in order to settle down. She was an independent individual with a mind and personality, and for that reason alone, Duncan couldn\u2019t force his decisions on her less he become an overbearing piece of shit like in the movies.In contrast, it\u2019s better to have Alice go to the kitchen and help than to keep her fighting with the ropes, anchors, and cannon shells\u2014at least the pots and pans on the Vanished are relatively safe.He looked down at the fish soup that had been placed next to him, and to be fair, the taste of the fish soup was actually quite normal. Although the seasoning on the ship was limited, but the doneness was completely fine. As a puppet who did not even have a sense of taste and digestive system, Alice had already done very well considering she\u2019s only going by the goat head\u2019s theoretical knowledge.So, what else could Duncan ask for from two individuals who couldn\u2019t eat human food?\u201cThat\u2026 Captain, do you want me to do something else for you?\u201d Alice\u2019s voice came from the side again at this time, interrupting Duncan\u2019s thinking, \u201cI also learned the method of grilled fish and fried fish fillet with Mr. Goathead. There\u2019s already some in the kitchen\u2026.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m not hungry,\u201d Duncan shook his head. Truth was his body actually didn\u2019t have much demand for food at all. The reason he\u2019s maintaining three meals a day was only to maintain his habit of being a \u201chuman\u201d. With Alice\u2019s soup today, his appetite had effectively been dispelled adequately for the day. Getting up from the chair, \u201cI want to take a walk around the cabins.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re going to the cabin?\u201d Alice was stunned, and then as if remembering something, her expression became slightly tense, \u201cThat\u2026 can you go \u2018below\u2019 and have a look?\u201d\u201cBelow?\u201d Duncan frowned.\u201cIt\u2019s the deeper cabins\u2014the places where I\u2019m not allowed to go,\u201d Alice said, \u201cI always hear creaking sound coming from underneath. Sometimes it sounds like someone is muttering under the floor. Will you go and have a look? There might be something going on down below\u2026\u201dLooking at the slightly nervous expression on Miss Doll\u2019s face, Duncan\u2019s heart gradually got lifted.The depths of the Vanished\u2026 It was a place he hadn\u2019t explored yet!Unlike the top area, the deepest parts gave him a strange and dangerous feeling. At that time, he had not yet \u201ctaken the helm\u201d and had not mastered the power of the ghost fire, so the previous explorations had stopped after the first few levels. Of course, he had plans for further exploration in the future, but now it seems that the plan obviously cannot catch up with the change.Just then, the voice of the goat head suddenly came from the side again: \u201cAh, it sounds like the bilge is a little restless. Captain, do you want to go down and have a look?\u201dBefore Duncan could speak, the goat head had already begun going on his rant: \u201cThink about it. You really haven\u2019t checked the bottom levels for a long time already. The bilge needs the comfort of the captain too, you know. After all, it has been immersed in the Boundless Sea for a long time\u2026 Would you like to bring your lantern along? It\u2019s kept in the usual spot, just behind the door\u2026 You\u2019ve been going up and down all this time so the guys down below are getting restless. You don\u2019t even know how annoying they are getting. Aigh, I\u2019m a lover of quiet and can\u2019t stand hearing the creaking sounds in the middle of the night\u2026\u201dDuncan glanced silently at the goat head, which suddenly got all quiet.Seriously, after hearing the stuff from the goat head\u2019s mouth, the idea of going down there just became all the more distasteful. From the way things sound, the lower parts had been more deeply affected by the Boundless Sea and the most likely place to have something bad happen!But the conflicting thought only lingered in the mind for less than a second.Sooner or later, he would have to make further explorations of the other structures on the Vanished, and earlier the better\u2026. Leaving unknown dangerous variables alone had never been wasn\u2019t his style.The Vanished was huge, not only amazingly long, but the depth of its cabin was also divided into many layers and sections. Therefore, the only area that Duncan knows so far would be the upper area: including the deck, the upper cabin, the ammunition depot below deck, the artillery area, the warehouse, the freshwater storage, and a part of the crew room. All of which are above the sea line, anything below that would effectively be within the realm of the Boundless Sea.He\u2019s already the ship\u2019s captain, and the Vanished was his foothold in this world to act as the base of operation. He could ignore everything else and turn a blind eye, but this ship meant everything to his survival. What\u2019s more, the guy has now gotten a better grasp of the ship\u2019s potential. If he\u2019s going to rely on something during a crisis, the Vanished would be it.Not to mention that just now the goat head also mentioned that the bilge needs the comfort of the captain.The \u201ccaptain\u201d has not been to the lower cabin for too long\u2026 If this continues, it seems that something bad will happen.Duncan promptly got up and went to the door to find the lantern mentioned by the goat head.It was a rather old lantern, the copper frame was in the shape of a narrow hexagonal prism, and the glass lampshade was embedded in the copper, appearing somewhat ambiguous with the wick-like structure inside the lampshade.He did not show curiosity on the face, nor did he attempt to ask the goat head for instruction. After a short silent and contemplation, he tried to activate the green ghost fire from within to infuse into the lantern.A cluster of bright green flames immediately jumped into existence and burned inside the lampshade, giving the surrounding area a quaint but constant glow.A cold atmosphere somehow pervaded wherever the lantern shone, but Duncan only got an inexplicable sense of calm and control standing in the light. It\u2019s as if he could faintly feel that his power was spreading with the light, and wherever the light shone, the terrain\u2019s details would be clearly reflected in his mind.Ai the dove suddenly flew over and landed on Duncan\u2019s shoulder then.It has transformed into her illusory undead bird form\u2014although Duncan did not actively \u201cactivate\u201d the bird at all, it still passively completed the \u201ctransformation\u201d under the lantern\u2019s illumination.This gave more ideas to Duncan at what this might imply.It seems to be able to diffuse my own power to its surroundings with minimal loss while maintaining a \u201cforce field\u201d that combines the functions of detection, warning, and even control, which is obviously quite suitable for long-term exploration in unfamiliar or dangerous areas.\u201cCaptain\u2026 Can I go with you?\u201dDuncan swung back and saw Alice standing behind him already. The doll\u2019s eyeing the lantern curiously with an eager expression on her face: \u201cI haven\u2019t been to the lower level yet! Mr. Goathead said I couldn\u2019t go down without your permission\u2026\u201dDuncan thought for a moment before giving a faint nod, \u201cAlright.\u201dHe didn\u2019t know what was in the lower part of the cabin, but regardless, it was also part of the Vanished. Under the premise that he had successfully \u201ctaken the helm\u201d, the bilge would not be too dangerous, and with this doll along, he might be able to take advantage of her help to handle things.The goat head, which remained on the mapping table, did not say anything to the arrangement. It was evident from its point of view that it was quite normal for the captain to inspect the Vanished, and the same was true with a helper.Outside the cabin, night had gradually fallen, and the cold glow of the creation of the world was shining down on the sea, illuminating the empty deck of the ghost ship along the translucent ghost sails stirring in the wind.With a lantern in his hand and his flintlock rifle, Duncan walked with Alice through the empty deck and uppermost cabin to where the staircases were located \u2013 this would be the spot Duncan had stopped exploring the last time he was here.\u201cIt\u2019s so dark underneath,\u201d Alice stood at the stairwell, looking a little nervously at the dim environment below, \u201cisn\u2019t there a light down there? Everywhere else is lit with some oil lamp that never goes out\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, there\u2019s a light down there alright,\u201d Duncan said, holding the lantern in his hand as he slowly raised it up to eye level. The power of the green flame gave him the awareness of what\u2019s happening in the lower cabins, \u201cIt\u2019s just that the lights are black instead.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 Huh?\u201d Alice was stunned for a moment and did not react for a while, \u201cThe lights are black?\u201dDuncan didn\u2019t reply, only walking first with the lantern acting as his light source and signaling the doll to follow, \u201cDon\u2019t be surprised, this is after all below the surface of the sea.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Eventually, she finally saw what the captain meant when he said \u201cthe lights are black\u201d.There were indeed lights in the lower cabin\u2014at least in terms of structure and layout. The cabin she saw had the same support columns as above with oil lamps hanging from the sides. However, the flames burning there didn\u2019t light the area but rather made the area in the vicinity darker than what\u2019s in the distance.That\u2019s right, the closer to the oil lamp, the darker the light becomes. It\u2019s as if the lamp itself were sucking in the light and turning everything dark.Alice stared at the cabin for a long time and couldn\u2019t find the right words to describe her logic, \u201cThis\u2026 doesn\u2019t make sense\u2026\u201d\u201cAn abnormal doll is telling me this is irrational?\u201d Duncan shot a look at Alice, asking if she was serious. \u201cUnder the water level of the Boundless Sea, any rationality is a thing of the past. This abnormality is what\u2019s normal.\u201dWhen he said this, his expression was quite indifferent as if the freaky situation had long been the norm for him. But what exactly was the truth? In reality, Duncan\u2019s mind wasn\u2019t any better because he\u2019s equally as spooked.\u201cThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s right\u2026\u201d Ai perfectly timed her speech and spoke in support of the captain\u2019s explanation.Ignoring the noise of the dove on his shoulders, he carefully observed the cabin that he had never set foot on. First adjusting the angle of the lantern in his hand to get a better view, Duncan wanted to get a gist of what\u2019s out there.Below the waterline of the Vanished\u2026 The lights in the cabin are \u201cinverted\u201d. The closer you get to the lamps, the darker it becomes like some sort of mirror image of the world. But my lantern is normal so that rule doesn\u2019t apply\u2026.Is there a principle behind this weirdness? Is this just the influence of the Boundless Sea, or is it mixed with the characteristics of the Vanished itself to cause this phenomenon? Is the \u201cbright environment\u201d in the cabin itself real? If those oil lamps are extinguished, will this place become brighter again?For a moment, Duncan really wanted to test his bold theory and blow out the oil lamps using his power. But in the next instant, sanity choked him back at the bad idea. Experience has taught him everything in the world must have a purpose, including the spooky black lamps as well.Then something occurred to him. In the city-state of Pland, their knowledge claimed that the light from a burning flame could dispel dangerous evils from the nearby premise. But Duncan now got a new theory. The actual part that\u2019s dispelling the evil wasn\u2019t the light produced by the flame but the actual fire itself, and under certain conditions, light and darkness may be inverted. In that case, wouldn\u2019t the only thing worth trusting be the flame itself and nothing else since only that remains true?\u201cCaptain?\u201d Alice\u2019s voice suddenly came from the side with nervousness and concern, \u201cIs there anything unusual here?\u201d\u201cThere are no abnormalities.\u201d Duncan\u2019s expression remained unchanged as he replied lightly while slowly striding forward.As he walked past the light absorbing lamps hanging from the support columns, Duncan had also noticed piles of ropes scattered at the base, which would\u2019ve been a problematic tripping incident if not for the fact that the ropes had squirmed away on their own to make way for the captain.For some reason, a thought came to mind: Light and shadow are the illusions of the deep sea, and reality is no longer credible at sea level. The only trustworthy thing is the flames themselves, always faithfully guarding the wealth of the Vanished.He watched the quietly burning lights with a new perspective and nodded to express his approval and gratitude.For that, the oil lamps throughout the entire cabin flared up, jumping and flickering with life to shroud the entire hall into further darkness\u2026..Duncan: \u201c\u2026.\u201dHe immediately regretted his initial assessment because that\u2019s what you call shooting your own foot.Alice had come up from behind then and carefully observed the surroundings. She could see the large wooden barrels and some crates piled up in the corners of the cabins, as well as some enclosed rooms and corridors leading to nowhere. Whispering: \u201cIt seems that this is also a warehouse\u2026 Was this once a cargo ship?\u201d\u201cIf it were a cargo ship, the cargo wouldn\u2019t be kept in such a deep place\u2014there\u2019s a concept called the cost of handling,\u201d Duncan shook his head and said casually. \u201cThese are ocean-going supplies, meant to be consumed by the Vanished itself during its long voyage.\u201dAlice blinked, \u201cOcean supply?\u201dDuncan did bother explaining and went forward to inspect some of the nearest cargo.A couple of the barrels contained some kind of grease, dark brown and viscous, but didn\u2019t have a overpowering stench like crude oil. Possibly some kind of fuel for the ship, but apparently had been stacked here for a long, long time. Duncan even suspected that the fuel had been \u201cstockpiled\u201d before the Vanished became a ghost ship, which might have been used for lighting and exorcism. Since the ship became a ghost vessel afterward, many of the things in the cargo hold were now effectively useless.Then in another part of the stacked barrels, Duncan saw something familiar \u2013 cheese older than him, bacon capable of cracking rocks.Duncan silently resealed the lid.Most of the places were piled up with reserve materials at this level. Although a considerable part of them seemed useless on by today\u2019s standard, it was enough to prove his previous judgment of the Vanished. At least in the beginning of its construction, the ship had been built for the intended purpose of going on some long voyage of exploration. The compartments are also all shielded to avoid spreading fire and pest infestation. Such a design wouldn\u2019t be needed if the trips were short.Now, however, this once ambitious plan of exploration was gone, along with its sailing crew. What\u2019s left was a natural disaster known to humanity as a plague of the sea, the Vanished\u2026.He and Alice continued to walk forward under these conditions, and after crossing several more separate warehouses, they had entered a new corridor with a staircase leading down another level.\u201cI feel like\u2026 it\u2019s getting more and more gloomy\u2026\u201d Miss Doll hugged her arm and whispered to the captain, \u201cDid you hear the wind? How can there be a sound of wind in the cabin?\u201d\u201cI heard it too, but don\u2019t be nervous, it\u2019s normal,\u201d Duncan said casually and then glanced at the doll again, \u201chow come your courage is so small? You\u2019re known as Anomaly 099. You shouldn\u2019t be afraid of this stuff at all.\u201dAs he spoke, he also thought about the information he had received from Nina before. In this world, there are many lists of \u201canomalies\u201d and \u201cvisions\u201d open to the people. These lists are there to help the people avoid the dangers they may encounter in daily life or identify some signs of abnormal behavior around themselves. Of course, such lists are never complete, often leaving some of the most dangerous and unique variables out of the general public\u2019s eye.He had tried to ask Nina about Anomaly 099 before of course, but the girl had never seen the number in the textbook.This shows that Alice\u2019s \u201ccursed doll\u201d either has a special secret involved, hence the blockade of information from the church and authorities, or\u2026. It\u2019s due to her being too dangerous and must be isolated from the minds of civilized society. Regardless of the reason, it couldn\u2019t be anything innocent or harmless.But this mysterious doll only shrunk her neck after hearing Duncan\u2019s comment. Making a nervous expression: \u201cIt\u2019s not like having a bigger number means I would be more courageous. I am Anomaly 099, not Courage 099\u2026.\u201dDuncan sighed, thinking that the doll may not be the most courageous out there, but she was most certainly the most cowardly. It\u2019s a good thing no sailor actually saw Alice\u2019s nervous and scared appearance, otherwise her image would be ruined\u2026.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 59": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Deep Sea EmbersCH 58Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 58 \u201cBilge\u201dThis Translation is hosted on https://bcatranslation.com/Duncan had always wondered what was so unique and dangerous about the gothic doll that made sailors fear her very name.It\u2019s true that a self-moving, sane puppet was very freaky in itself, and the scene of her occasionally running around with her head off was shocking. However, in Duncan\u2019s view, this level of freakiness wouldn\u2019t be enough to get her a spot in the upper rank of the Anomaly list.According to Nina\u2019s own words:Anomaly 196 \u2013 Blood, a dangerous anomaly contained and sealed in the underground sanctuary of the Church of Pland. Its body is the equivalent to the blood volume of an adult male\u2019s whole body. It has the characteristics of flowing on its own and will actively try to replace the blood of any nearby eligible \u201chost\u201d for occupation. The way to prevent its escape is to store it within twenty-two blood tanks and maintain a freezing temperature. However, if someone bleeds within ten meters of the storage site, the seal will immediately fail with the person promptly attached by Anomaly 196.Important notice \u2013 this anomaly ignores any countermeasures by a Saint and will kill its hosts as a result.As one of the most dangerous anomalies managed by the Pland city-state, information about Anomaly 196-Blood is always open to the public. This ensures that once the anomaly leaks into the urban area, authorities can quickly locate it and take action to deal with it.Duncan didn\u2019t know what the concept of a so-called \u201csaint\u201d was, but by the naming, it was supposed to correspond to some sort of fairly powerful level of a transcendent being. Perhaps that inquisitor Vanna who had appeared in the newspapers was a saint and wielded some kind of power as a transcendent being\u2014and how many Saints like her could possibly stand up to the Anomaly 196 in these city-states?This was just an anomaly at the further end of the hundreds, nearly hitting the two hundred mark. The fact that Alice was ranked 099 meant she\u2019s far more dangerous than what Blood could do.Although according to Nina, there was some uncertainty between the numbering of anomalies and visions, and different anomalies and visions are not always able to be compared and contrasted in terms of weakness and strength. Nevertheless, the top anomalies and visions usually had a higher risk in general or stranger and uncontrollable \u201ccharacteristics\u201d. In many cases, they\u2019ve caused enough damage to contribute to a special historical event, thus firmly earning themselves a spot in the high rankers.In any case, one only needs to know that the number within a hundred rank represented danger or some kind of extremely tricky characteristic. But this cursed doll named Alice though\u2026.Duncan subconsciously glanced back at Alice, who was honestly following behind him and smiling innocently back at the attention.It is impossible to expect this one to figure out her own dangerous aspect. Maybe there is information kept inside the historical archives at Pland. But will they let an antique dealer in the lower parts of the city have access?Duncan pondered the feasibility of the idea while continuing to creep through the cabins. Through their exploration, the green flames from the lantern in his hand also revealed more of the area. It\u2019s eerie and psychedelic in how warped everything appeared. It\u2019s like everything\u2019s a mirror image of what it should be under the green glow\u2019s illumination.To outsiders, this would likely give them a headache and seizure. But in Duncan\u2019s case, he only found his mind getting calmer and clearer through the feedback of the ship. Right now, he\u2019s definitely regaining control on parts of the ship that hadn\u2019t come to him the first time around, which had the added effect of calming the restless items down here.\u201cYou really are afraid of the bottom of the sea. Even if it\u2019s only you coming down to the cabins down here,\u201d Duncan suddenly said to Alice, who was clinging closely behind his back.\u201cI\u2026 I didn\u2019t expect it either!\u201d Alice forced her composure, \u201cBack then, I only thought this was part of the ship. I didn\u2019t think going below deck meant going below sea level! I\u2019m just a puppet!\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t even have a digestive tract, yet you still study cooking. Don\u2019t use the fact that you\u2019re a doll as an excuse,\u201d Duncan said casually, \u201cand you\u2019ll need to make up for your lack of knowledge later on the ship.\u201dAlice sighed in frustration over that remark before Duncan interrupted, \u201cWhy are you so afraid of the deep sea anyway? Or rather\u2026 Why are you so afraid of \u2018soaking in the sea\u2019? I know that the deep sea is dangerous, and many people are afraid of the water like you. Still, the way you\u2019re behaving\u2026 it appears more severe than I initially thought that just imagining you\u2019re underwater is enough to scare you silly. Hey, quit grabbing the frills on your dress. If it tears, there\u2019s nothing on the ship to sew it back on.\u201d\u201cOh,\u201d Alice quickly relaxed her hand a little but then unconsciously tugged at the button instead, \u201cI\u2026 I didn\u2019t think about this problem at all. I\u2019m just afraid. Is being afraid not okay?\u201dDuncan refused to comment on the doll\u2019s question and focused back on what was in front. The stairs here led to somewhere deeper into the ship, probably down to the lowest point where it met with the waters. It\u2019s just as dark as the previous areas, but after raising the lantern to gain a better view, the pair can vaguely make out the silhouette of a door.This discovery made the ghost captain frown because this staircase was weird. Unlike the stairs they had climbed, this one had been isolated on the opposite side of the ship, which didn\u2019t make sense from a design perspective.Furthermore, they\u2019ve been walking for far too long. Sure, the Vanished was a long and big ship, the length they\u2019ve walked didn\u2019t add up.Lastly, why would a door be at the end of a staircase?Duncan grew hesitant but picked up the lantern and proceeded anyways since he didn\u2019t like unknown variables lurking in the shadow.Alice hesitated even more at this freaky discovery, but in the end, she too had followed suit from the rear. In her view, compared to standing alone in the darkness at the top of the last staircase, she\u2019s better off following the captain and owner of this ghost ship.Soon they were now standing before this mysterious door. Raising his lantern to illuminate the surroundings, Duncan quickly took notice of the words atop of the doorframe: \u201cThe Last Door of the Bilge.\u201d\u201cWhat does this mean?\u201d Alice read the words with confusion and curiosity. \u201cThe last door of the bilge\u2026 Under normal circumstances, shouldn\u2019t the name around the doorframe indicate its function instead?\u2019\u201cApparently a reminder,\u201d Duncan thoughtfully withdrew his gaze from the doorframe and rested a hand on the doorknob, \u201cIf you go in and find that there is another door, don\u2019t touch them.\u201dAlice nodded nervously, then saw Duncan take the final step in pushing open the \u201clast door of the bilge.\u201dA strange pale shimmer greeted them as they stepped through into an open space.\u201cThis\u2026 This\u2026\u201d Alice\u2019s eyes widened in shock and disbelief at what she saw. \u201cCa-Captain! The bottom of the ship is broken! It\u2019s broken!\u201dShe shouted loudly, only to be ignored by Duncan who were equally as shocked and stunned by the scene.The deepest layer of the Vanished was fragmented!As far as the eye could see, huge cracks of were carved into the fabric of reality, causing the room to appear fragmented and chaotic. But beyond this, Duncan could still clearly see the \u201cscenery\u201d beyond the bilge.It was not the deep and dark vast sea he had imagined, but a pale and obscure nothingness mixed in with numerous lights and shadows flickering through the void.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 60": "Chapter 60 \u201cOpposite Side Of The Door\u201dThis Translation is hosted on https://bcatranslation.com/Alice\u2019s voice suddenly came from the side: \u201cUhhh? Captain, are we leaving? Doesn\u2019t this door need to be checked? Even if you don\u2019t open it\u2026\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to see anymore. It\u2019s the end of the bilge.\u201d Duncan said casually.But just then, a slight tapping sound had caused him to stop.Duncan shot his head to meet Alice\u2019s, who had fallen over and frantically looking around for the source of that noise. Eventually, her frightened gaze locked onto the dark wooden door: \u201cThe sound seems to be coming from behind this door\u2026\u201dDuncan froze on the spot, glaring fiercely at the door as well when the knocking came again. It sounded faint, but it was no illusion, that much was certain. Jerking backward to gain a little distance, he didn\u2019t want to be a victim of whatever was behind that door either.However, after a brief but fierce struggle inside, the ghost captain decides to return to the door after the noise died down.Holding the ghost fire lantern up to his face, while also drawing his sword out, Duncan carefully examined for any clues as to the cause. Then that\u2019s when he realized the door hadn\u2019t been completely shut. On the right corner of his view, there\u2019s about a centimeter of a crack that would allow him to peek through the opening.From the way things look, it\u2019s as if someone had hastily closed it behind themselves and not a deliberate act.Knowing he wouldn\u2019t be able to ignore this opportunity, Duncan leaned in and peered through the slit while making sure his blade was ready to stab at whatever that might snap at him.However, what he saw was beyond anything he could\u2019ve imagined.It\u2019s a small room, which looked as if it had been some years since someone renovated it based on the wrinkly wallpapers. The furnishings were also messy, and the single bed in the corner with the computer table were all too familiar\u2026.But more importantly, there\u2019s a certain tall, thin figure currently writing something at the desk. The man wore a white shirt with unkept hair, which showed how ragged the person had been due to the circumstances.Duncan stared heavily at everything behind the door, the familiar bed, the familiar desk, and the familiar books, and most importantly, the familiar \u201chim\u201d who was scribbling something onto the old diary he usually kept in the drawers. But then, as if sensing his own presence, the other him known as Zhou Ming jerked up and ran over to the door to stare right back at Duncan.This freaky and silent staring contest continued like this for several seconds until the other him began shoving hard at the door. The way he behaved was of someone trying to come out, yet the door was remained unfazed like a brick wall. So, the other him began to break the lock with a tool, trying hard to pry the slit further apart to no avail.Eventually, the man inside the door finally gave up and slumped down like a deflated balloon. Duncan couldn\u2019t hear what the other \u201chim\u201d was saying at that moment, only vague garbled noises. Nevertheless, he knew all too well what the other man was trying to do because he had experienced everything firsthand.Gradually, Duncan\u2019s gaze slowly fell upon the doorknob over on this side of the Vanished. All he had to do was twist and push, and surely, perhaps, it would open\u2026.However, instinct kicked in and stopped Duncan from taking this last step.Somehow, this decision frustrated the man trapped inside the room and begun shouting and pounding at the door again. The voice couldn\u2019t reach of course, but then the other him had suddenly bent down and started scribbling something on a piece of paper to show Duncan.Through the slit in the door, Duncan saw a string of scrawled words: \u201cSave me!\u201d I\u2019m stuck in this room! Windows and doors can\u2019t be opened!\u201dDuncan instantly burst out laughing. Not anger, not sadness, not even an urge to save \u201chimself\u201d, but humor at the Zhou Ming that\u2019s trapped inside the room.The next second, the pirate sword in Duncan\u2019s hand suddenly stabbed forward and into \u201cZhou Ming\u2019s\u201d body.The latter got pierced by the blade without surprise. As it opened its mouth and screamed, Duncan neither flinched nor backed away, but shoved harder with his pirate sword to make sure it goes through.\u201cIf you can\u2019t write earth words then don\u2019t use this trick.\u201dAi, the dove who had been silent until now, suddenly flapped her wings and made a hoarse chirp: \u201cThis is an illusion. What are you hiding?\u201dThe next second, the figure across the door rapidly melted away like a wax figure until it completely dissipated into a series of light and shadow. Likewise, the familiar room also faded away, revealing its true nature to Duncan\u2019s eyes: a dark and old cabin with an air of dust and decay.As for the sword in his hand, it\u2019s giving no feedback since it\u2019s hitting air instead.This \u201cextra door\u201d is just another cabin behind it?Duncan continued to observe the situation some more, but this time, no matter how it looked, it seemed to be just an ordinary cabin.But\u2026\u2026 is that cabin really \u201creal\u201d?Duncan unhurriedly withdrew the sword that had probed through the slit, then breathed a sigh of relief before taking half a step back.The strange thing he had just encountered was still deeply imprinted in his mind, and he didn\u2019t know if it was a simple illusion or something else entirely. Nevertheless, one thing was certain\u2026 This door definitely has something strange and dangerous behind it.If the illusion reflected on the opposite side of the door was based on his own memory and cognition, then that meant the danger it posed was greater than his own \u201cCaptain Duncan\u201d. That would be a nightmare if true.No one in this world should know what that room looks like, and no one should know the existence of the individual known as \u201cZhou Ming\u201d.But the \u201cthing\u201d across the door knows\u2026.Forcing his anxiety to calm down through a long series of breathing.The caution I chose to take is correct. In any case, I mustn\u2019t open this door.\u201cCaptain\u2026\u201d Alice\u2019s voice suddenly came and woke Duncan from his contemplation. As the man looked up at the doll, the man quickly noticed the doll\u2019s concerned and frightened expression, \u201cCaptain, are you all right? What\u2019s behind that door? Why is your expression so serious\u2026\u201dDuncan shook his head, \u201cNothing, behind this door is not where you should look. We\u2019ve reached the bottom of the bilge and can go back now.\u201dAs he spoke, the man made sure to try to tug at the door to see him he could close it for good. Yet, he couldn\u2019t the wooden construct didn\u2019t budge at all like some unsettling slumbering beast.\u201cHuh? Ah\u2026\u2026 Okay!\u201d Alice did not care about the captain\u2019s attempt to close the door. She was too stunned at first but quickly changed her mood with a happy expression, \u201cThen let\u2019s hurry back. This place is still quite weird to be honest. It\u2019s giving me the creeps\u2026\u201dDuncan snorted nonchalantly and led Alice towards the \u201clast door\u201d connecting to the stairs.In reality, this place was so spooky that even he didn\u2019t want to stay long.Afterward, nothing unusual happened: they made it through the crumbling bilge, through the lighted cargo compartment, through the dark staircase and corridors to the cabin above the waterline.Duncan didn\u2019t think much of their trip back up, but Alice on the other hand found her whole body relaxing the second she came above deck. It\u2019s as if an imperceptible shadow had been dispelled from over her shoulders.\u201cCaptain, are you tired?\u201d Alice asked cautiously after noticing the concern in the man\u2019s eye, \u201cDo you want me to make you something to eat? You didn\u2019t have a good dinner\u2026\u201dDuncan stopped his thoughts and turned to face the concerned-looking doll \u2013 just like Nina\u2019s face when she\u2019s worried.Knowing he\u2019s making the atmosphere bad, the man quickly relaxed his face and forced the haze that was shrouding over his heart to recede.\u201cDon\u2019t drop something weird into the pot this time.\u201d\u201cMy head is not a strange thing!\u201d\u201cEspecially your head.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 Woohoo.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 61": "Chapter 61 \u201cUnstable Navigation\u201dThis Translation is hosted on https://bcatranslation.com/Duncan thought he spent the entire night exploring the ship, but upon looking up at the darkness of the night, it appears he and the doll had only spent a few hours. Nevertheless, the impression it left on his mind was enough to last.What exactly is that thing behind the door\u2026.Eventually, the two had come before the captain\u2019s room. Neither had spoken much during the journey \u2013 Alice remains focused on what she\u2019s going to make in the kitchen, while Duncan\u2019s sight had landed on the stuff around the deck.According to his memory, the makeup here was practically the same as the design down in the lowest level \u2013 long and connected from one end to the other. Even so, he got this aching suspicion that he was missing something, like there was another passage or room hidden inside that dilapidated cabin that he was not aware of.Does the goat head know about that door? Does it know where it leads?Should I ask it myself?When Duncan finally reached to open the door, he was still lost in thought when Alice\u2019s voice called out to the goat head. The wooded figurine was still sitting quietly on the mapping table like usual, giving no sign of ever hanging.\u201cMr. Goathead! I went to the bilge with the captain! This ship is so incredible underneath! The bottom cabin is torn apart, and there\u2019s a strange door at the end!\u201dThat did it. Instead of trying to start the topic on his own, the doll had done the nice act of doing it on his stead.Trying to keep himself from making a sound, the ghost captain pretended to pack his things and listened to the conversation in the background.\u201cOh Miss Alice, I knew you would be surprised! Do you understand how great the Vanished is as a ship? It can sail across different dimensions at the same time without being a detriment to our safety!\u201dDuncan\u2019s heart suddenly jerked at the information. It\u2019s as he suspected, the ship was indeed sailing across multiple dimensions and not bound to this plane of existence!At the same time, his mind was also thinking quickly: Since Alice is full of curiosity about the lower half of the Vanished, she\u2019s going to keep asking for more information. Since I\u2019m too intimidating for her to direct those questions, the only obvious choice is the goat head. But if I stay here and listen, it will get awkward and weird. On top of that, I risk getting thrown the ball if the wooded figurine shifts her questions over to me. At that point, I won\u2019t be able to answer Alice\u2019s question.By then, the ghost captain has hatched a plan. With a straight face, he casually said, \u201cYou two talk, I\u2019m going out for a walk. Goat Head, Alice is already a member of the ship. As long as the subject is not too sensitive, you can tell her anything.\u201dAlice smiled cheerfully as soon as she heard this, and the goat head didn\u2019t object either and immediately agreed: \u201cOf course Captain, your loyal first mate will always welcome a new member\u2026\u201dDone with that, Duncan pushed the door open and left the captain\u2019s room. But the next second he did so, the sneaky bastard concentrated his mind again and connected with the Vanished at a spiritual level. Through this, he could spy on the pair without the chance of being caught.As he focused, the vague perception became clearer and clearer until he saw Alice sitting on a stool across from the talking goat head.Apparently, the girl had forgotten how scared she was behaving during the entire trip and even omitted the fact that she offered to make the captain\u2019s late-night snack. Naturally, the man himself didn\u2019t care at all for the latter part.Meanwhile, Ai the dove had flown herself up to the nearest mast while the owner did the horrendous act of eavesdropping. The bird had enough insight to act as a scout in case someone tried to sneak up on him like some naughty sidekick at a bank job.\u201c\u2026 That door looked a little scary, and the captain wouldn\u2019t let me get close\u2026\u201d Miss Doll had already glossed over the part about the lamp light being inverted and had started recounting the mysterious door.\u201cThat\u2019s a given. Not only you, but even I can\u2019t touch that door. Don\u2019t make that face. I know I don\u2019t have any arms or legs. When I say touch, I mean it in another sense\u2026 interact, control, overseeing, you understand? That door is untouchable in every sense of the word\u2026 you didn\u2019t touch it did you?\u201dAlice seemed to be startled by the extra severe tone from the goat head there. After a split second of hesitation, she jolted and cried: \u201cThat\u2026 what is that door then?\u201dThis part had the direct effect of hooking Duncan\u2019s attention to the fullest. Yet, the goat head was dastardly enough to go silent for a good minute before replying: \u201cYou really didn\u2019t touch it?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t touch it!\u201d Alice replied hurriedly but then hesitated again before continuing, \u201cBut\u2026 But the captain leaned over and looked inside. There was a slit open so he stabbed his sword through the crack at something\u2026\u201dAs soon as the doll said that, Duncan could feel the entire ship shaking, followed by the low whimpering sound of the wind hitting the sails. There\u2019s also the creaking sound of the wood and ropes, but those were so messy that he didn\u2019t know which came from which. This was obviously coming from the goat head who was steering the Vanished!\u201cWhat did you say?! There\u2019s a slit in the door? There\u2019s a crack?!\u201d It didn\u2019t need the power of spying to know how shocked and astonished the goat head was.\u201cThat\u2026 That\u2019s right\u2026\u201d Alice seemed frightened by the strong words, \u201cthe door was softly closed so it didn\u2019t fully lock, probably about a finger\u2019s wide at the side\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd the captain peeked through the slit? And then what? He stabbed his sword\u2026 did anything change about him at that time? Did he behave oddly or fall into a trance?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d replied Alice at once, \u201cthe captain just had a serious face when he pulled his sword back out. Then he brought me back up here like something\u2019s troubling his mind. I offered to cook him something because of that. Oh right, I was about to go to the kitchen before\u2026.\u201d\u201cForget the kitchen! Do you know what\u2019s behind that door?\u201d\u201cAhh\u2026 What\u2019s behind that door?\u201d Alice\u2019s tone still sounded stunned and a little dazed this time. She had never seen the goat head be so serious and urgent before so it worried her a lot.\u201cBehind that door, is subspace\u2026.\u201dDuncan, who was walking around the deck, froze on the spot.Behind that door, is subspace?He was stunned beyond words, and rightfully so.So the lowest level of the ship is actually sailing in subspace?! But based on what the goat head implied, this state of navigation isn\u2019t stable at all. In that case, is the slit at the door not supposed to be there? That it\u2019s supposed to be entirely closed? Or is it\u2026. That something on the other side had forced it open\u2026.Duncan didn\u2019t think much about it at the time, but when he recalled how strange the resistance was from the door, a frightening idea hit him.Maybe\u2026\u2026 When I tried to close the door earlier, something on the other side was pulling against my hand and preventing it from being closed\u2026.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 62": "Chapter 62 \u201cOverlap\u201dThis Translation is hosted on https://bcatranslation.com/The shocking revelation that the Vanished had been navigating through subspace the entire time sent Duncan\u2019s mood into a peculiar low.He had always known that the Vanished was very strange and dangerous, but he had never imagined that the ship would be so abnormal. For example, his knowledge was most likely inferior to Nina\u2019s history teach on this subject, but he knew enough that subspace was the most dangerous thing in this world. It\u2019s enough to make those saints unable to sleep at night, make gods wary and afraid, and cause sailors to never dare shout the word \u201csubspace\u201d during their voyage.If everything is true, that dimly lit dilapidated cabin opposite of the door may be a seal set in place by the real Captain Duncan. Perhaps that area had already been eroded by subspace and cannot be restored?Duncan subconsciously looked down like he\u2019s able to see through the deck and onto that shattered cabin room. Right now, he no longer felt safe to be here, more like someone stepping on a powder keg that would explode at any moment. That little gap was the fuse, and once opened completely, that\u2019s when the bomb would blow.But after a brief moment of wild nervous tension, Duncan relaxed after recalling another piece of information the goat head revealed.According to the panicked look the wooded figurine showed after hearing Alice\u2019s story, Captain Duncan was supposed to behave weird and off like something terrible had happened. But nothing has happened so far, right? He\u2019s perfectly fine even after stabbing the sword through that slit in the door.Okay, maybe saying he\u2019s perfectly fine was a bit too positive. When he saw the illusion, Duncan did panic a little and thought about opening the door, but that\u2019s only a simple psychological change and not the influence of supernatural power affecting his mind.Duncan lowered his head and fixed his sight on his own hands, confirming again and again that nothing was wrong.Here, I am Duncan, captain of the Vanished.In another space-time, my name is Zhou Ming, an ordinary middle school teacher that\u2019s trapped in a single apartment room shrouded in the fog.Maybe\u2026 it\u2019s the goat head overreacting? It was only a crack in the door, not an entire open passage to the subspace.No longer swaying in his belief, Duncan raised his head and looked forward at the swaying masts and creaking ship that was battering against the waves. Right now, the controller had failed in its duty to steer the Vanished on the right course.\u201cFirst Mate, take charge of the rudder and control the sails properly!\u201d He snaps, ordering the goat head through his mental connection.\u201cCa\u2026 Captain?\u201d The voice of the goat head immediately rang out with a little panic, \u201cAh, yes! Yes Captain!\u201dDuncan did not say another word for he knew there\u2019s going to be more from the goat head: \u201cCaptain, I just heard Miss Alice say\u2026 the door at the bottom of the bilge opened a slit\u2026\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d replied Duncan softly, \u201cI checked.\u201d\u201cYou did check, and Miss Alice said you confirmed the situation across the door\u2026\u201d The goat head seemed to be weighing the pros and cons of asking, \u201cRight now, do you feel\u2026 I mean, a little bit hazy? Across that door is\u2026\u201d\u201cSubspace, I know,\u201d Duncan interrupted without waiting for the goat head to finish, \u201cdo you see me as if I\u2019m mentally unwell? Quit beating around the bush.\u201d\u201cOf course, you don\u2019t look anything out of the ordinary!\u201d The goat head immediately said, \u201cMaybe I was too nervous, after all, this kind of thing has never happened before. Since you drove the ship back, the barrier between the Vanished and the subspace has been very stable. I\u2026 I didn\u2019t expect the situation to change, and this is by no means of me doubting you.\u201dDrive the ship back? From where?Duncan keenly caught the detail revealed by the goat head and quickly guessed a bit of the truth. Acting casually like he didn\u2019t care: \u201cAs far as I can see, the crack in the door is still very stable, but I do not rule out the possibility of further expansion. I want to hear your opinion.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 It\u2019s already good news to know it\u2019s stable, Captain,\u201d said the goat head with a rather worried face. \u201cAs for my suggestion\u2026 to tell you the truth, I don\u2019t know what to do. You left the door and you\u2019re the one who closed it with your own hands. You never told me what plans you had in mind, nor did you mention any changes. The bilge had always been handled by you personally\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 I see,\u201d Duncan said at once, \u201cyou don\u2019t have any suggestions in this regard then.\u201dFrom the looks of it, the goat head doesn\u2019t know everything about the door down at the bilge either. He only knows it leads to the subspace, that it\u2019s dangerous once opened, and that the real Captain Duncan had left it behind. But where am I supposed to find a \u201creal Captain Duncan\u201d at this timing?\u201cCaptain\u2026\u201d the voice of the goat head sounded in his head again, \u201cwhat is your next arrangement?\u201dArrangement? What arrangement? Am I supposed to head for land now? That will not happen with a reputation as bad as Captain Duncan\u2019s. The entire naval fleet will likely attack me when I show up on the coastal waters.Duncan rolled his eyes and looked helplessly up at the sky. Meanwhile, the dove had flown down from the mast and landed on his shoulders. Making a cheery chirp, \u201cThis is a trap! Abandon the ship and escape!\u201d\u201cEscape? Run to where\u2026\u201d Duncan said subconsciously but then quickly realized something, \u201cWait, can you hear me talking to the goat head?\u201dHe had been talking to the goat head through the spiritual connection of the ship, so how did this bird follow up with such appropriate words?The dove flapped her wings and looked down at its toes: \u201cQuit bitching bastard, I have my own understanding!\u201dAt this moment, Duncan suddenly wanted to know what a dove soup would taste like.But he hadn\u2019t forgotten the goat head was still on the other line. Fixing his attention back on the subject, he promptly replied, \u201cYou do your own thing and leave the door to me. Nothing has changed.\u201d\u201cAye, Captain!\u201d The shaky attitude of the Vanished gradually stabilized, and the sails were re-angled properly to continue the voyage.After coming up to the edge of the deck once he had ended the conversation, Duncan watched as the battering waves hit the ship\u2019s hull while they sailed. During this period, he reflected on the list of things he needed to do.Naturally, observing the bilge had just been added to the list, but just watching wouldn\u2019t change the situation. He needs more knowledge, more power, and perhaps\u2026 some help from the outside\u2026 Maybe the city-state of Pland?Nina will return from school tomorrow, and her \u201cUncle Duncan\u201d will also need to be at the store when the time comes. Before that takes place, I must hurry and learn to fully control both bodies, otherwise I will end up having to switch back and forth with my main consciousness. Then there\u2019s the arrangement of transporting supplies over to the Vanished from Pland. That must also be tested further through Ai\u2019s ability.Then his eyes caught a glimpse of the \u201cWorld Creation\u201d reflecting on the waters.The World Creation?!Duncan was stunned for a second because a vague sense of familiarity just hit him.Raising his head upwards, he started to wonder. It\u2019s the same pale glowing wound as he observed the first time, but unlike in the past, he now got a new perspective. Those pale glows are not just a fog of light, but a myriad of overlapping and entangled streams of light, just like\u2026. what he observed down at the shattered cabin of the Vanished.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 63": "Chapter 63 \u201cReturn To Port\u201dThis Translation is hosted on https://bcatranslation.com/Is the scene inside the bottom of the Vanished the World Creation?If the bottom of the ship is indeed the subspace, then is the World Creation also part of the subspace? Or at least there is some connection between the two?But in the end, conjectures and speculation are only that, speculations. He had no evidence of this being true.The scar was too far away to make any experimental comparison, and even if he looked through a telescope, it wouldn\u2019t provide any more detail than what he knows now.Duncan spent a long time afterward just standing on the deck and letting the sea breeze blow against his face. The guy wanted to think about things, but more than that, he wanted to make sure everything was back in order.The news of him touching the \u201cdoor\u201d had unsettled the Vanished, and even now, there\u2019s a notable tremor happening across the ship and its habitants.\u201cRelax, this is nothing to worry about.\u201d Duncan tapped the nearest armrest and said in a calming voice.This time, he got clear feedback: the tension from the ship gradually subsided, and the ropes and sails had stopped shaking.From the looks of it, the ship has reaffirmed the captain remains the captain and not something else.Duncan eventually returned to the entrance of the captain\u2019s room after doing that, but instead of gently pulling the door open like usual, he used a bit of force and pushed it inward.As expected, the swirling grey fog was still there when he did this.Ai didn\u2019t stay on the ghost captain\u2019s shoulder then; instead, she suddenly flapped her ways and flew to the nearest mast and cried out: \u201cThe road ahead is broken! The road ahead is broken!\u201dThat earned a curious glance from the man himself, but in the end, he still stepped through and returned to the familiar bachelor apartment.Here, he\u2019s Zhou Ming, the regular normal human of Earth. He still had on his familiar shirt, his familiar trouser, and a body far weaker than Captain Duncan\u2019s.Afterward, he examined the room for any differences. From what he could tell, everything was as he had left it. Not even the layer of dust had changed from the some areas.Then Zhou Ming mindfully turned around and faced the door behind himself \u2013 he wanted to test something.Assuming there\u2019s another person behind the door, Duncan took on the same position as the fake did behind that door down at the Vanished. Then leaving only a slit, he peered through, expecting a surprise somehow.This foolish act left Zhou Ming\u2019s heart pounding. Even though it\u2019s unreasonable to assume anyone would be there or that a ghost captain would suddenly stab a pirate sword through the crack. Nevertheless, the thought of this happening still brought exhilaration to the guy.Yet, there was only the billowing swirling black fog outside of his room.While Zhou Ming became relieved that he didn\u2019t get stabbed, a strange sense of loss still plagued his heart. It\u2019s stupid of course to think this way. Who in their right mind would want to be stabbed? But he just couldn\u2019t help it.Shaking his head vigorously to shrug off the idiotic desire, he slowly got up and came to his desk. There\u2019s the scrap paper he scribbled on, the diary he used, and the computer screen in the middle that\u2019s still running despite the power being cut off.Nothing\u2019s changed\u2026.Zhou Ming exhaled, but suddenly, his expression froze.There is a change!His gaze had fixed onto the corner of the desk where there\u2019s a lifelike model of the Vanished just sitting there\u2026.A stroke of lightning blasted Zhou Ming in the head. Crumbling into the chair as he gasped for air from the shock, the man took several good minutes to get over this discovery.Once he\u2019s confirmed there was no mistake in his memory about this model ship never being here before, Zhou Ming hastily snatched the item up with his hand and examined the darn thing.This realistic-looking \u201cghost ship\u201d was only about half a foot long, and the thing didn\u2019t weigh any different from an ordinary model. However, the details were so refined that he could clearly see the ropes and buckets strewn across the deck\u2026Compared with the real Vanished, the only difference was its size.Abruptly, Zhou Ming appeared to have thought of something. Lifting the ship up to eye level, he carefully buckled open the door leading into the captain\u2019s room at the stern with his finger.He could see the miniature mapping table, but there was no wooded figurine of the goat head nor the sight of Alice.A surge of weirdness gripped Zhou Ming at why he would think this. It\u2019s outrageous to think a model ship would have Alice inside it, but then again, wasn\u2019t the ship model\u2019s appearance outrageous in itself?The guy stayed in this state for a long while afterward to ponder the next step.He didn\u2019t know how the ship had appeared on his desk, but it was clear that the connection between his cordoned bachelor\u2019s apartment and the \u201cworld across the door\u201d was more profound than he had imagined.The change may have occurred after he \u201ctook the helm\u201d or peered into subspace through the crack in the door. Regardless of the reason though, one thing\u2019s certain, he\u2019s still getting feedback from the other bodies across the door. This meant there was no threat to him yet from the change.Just like that, he sat in the chair for who knows how long until his eyes caught a glimpse of the shelf to the right.He had bought this cabinet years ago, but even until today, the guy never found the opportunity to fill it up aside from some decorative crystals.Figuring there was no better timing, Zhou Ming held the Vanished up and carefully placed the \u201cmodel\u201d in one segment of the shelf. Done with that, he took two steps back and examined his \u201cachievements\u201d with a weird sense of satisfaction.How this thing came to be in his room was still a mystery, but during his days of entrapment, he\u2019s got a new hobby of decorating this empty shelf.\u2026\u2026A loud and melodious whistle broke the calm on the sea this morning. Vanna, who had arrived in the port early, immediately came to the observation deck to oversee the start of the operation.The authorities had emptied the place in advance so there was no worry of innocent bystanders getting dragged into the mess. Instead, heavily armed policemen and clerics from the church were patrolling the dock with twelve of those spider steam walkers acting as blockades to the roads.Soon enough, the intended target had begun to approach the coastal waters.It\u2019s a large mechanical steamship, the White Oak.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 64": "Chapter 64 \u201cWhite Oak\u2019s Encounter With Duncan\u201dThis Translation is hosted on https://bcatranslation.com/The White Oak has returned\u2014after a long period of disconnection and deviation from course, the advanced steamship belonging to the Adventurer\u2019s Association has finally returned to the city-state of Pland.Inquisitor Vanna didn\u2019t need to give further orders. As soon as the whistle from that vessel blew, the personnel on the dock immediately took action.The staff guiding the ship to dock had arrived and began to signal the White Oak with lights and flags, while the Church\u2019s Guardians went to activate the deep-sea relics that had been placed all over Pier No.1 the night before: a large number of bronze \u201cboundary tablets\u201d with the name of the storm goddess Gmona inscribed on the base, and sacred grease and spices were strewn along the floor to connect all the tablets together. This arrangement would effectively seal off the area and become a \u201choly ground\u201d under the goddess\u2019s gaze.Farther away were the policemen sent by the city hall. These ordinary folks weren\u2019t capable of dealing with the supernatural; therefore, their main job was limited to blocking off the intersections with those steam spiders. Ordinary guns didn\u2019t have much effect in dealing with the dreadful and invisible curses, but blowing apart a physical monster that might jump off the White Oak was plenty good enough.Eventually, Vanna\u2019s gaze crossed the dock and fell upon the White Oak that had blown a second whistle after drawing close enough to assess the situation aboard.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look too bad Inquisitor. The White Oak has carried out its instructions, and it seems that the ship is still controlled by humans.\u201d One of the priests standing next to Vanna murmurs in a slightly relieved tone.\u201cThings aren\u2019t certain yet. Many people affected by visions and anomalies will appear no different from ordinary people until they mutate.\u201d Vanna shook her head to dismiss the thought of success, \u201cSend out the second set of signals and have the inspection crew board it. I want all guns pointed at the ship in case anything changes\u2026. Do not hesitate to open fire if it does.\u201dThe order from was quickly conveyed to those beneath, and since the White Oak\u2019s communications device had been damaged, the people on shore could only communicate with the ship using lights and flags. After a complex set of lights and banners again, the bow of the White Oak lit up three lights, followed by the dropping of a rope ladder on its side.Seeing this, the speedboat from the dock was promptly driven over using a steam mechanism. The inspection team had been comprised entirely of Guardians from the church, including eight combatants and a priest commander who lit the incense aboard to ward off evil while also sprinkling spiced grease around the waters. As long as the commander remains well and continues to chant the holy name of the Storm Goddess, no anomaly should be able to escape their findings. Supposedly anyway.After all this was done, the priests and guardians on the speedboat swiftly climbed the rope ladder with ease.This all fell into Vann\u2019s eyes, who had remained on a wary lookout the entire time inside the watchtower.It was perilous to let a ship that had been lost at sea \u201creturn home\u201d, especially when its objective was to transport anomalies across the ocean. So, first, it mustn\u2019t be allowed to dock and inspected by a team at a safe distance. But that\u2019s not enough to enable the crew to disembark though. Instead, the second round of inspection must be followed to ensure the vessel itself hasn\u2019t been mutated into something else entirely. This second step also allowed the team to perform a purification operation across the entire vessel to ensure nothing lurked in the darkness. Once done, everyone \u2013 including the inspection team \u2013 is to be kept on close observation by the church for several days to a week. This of course also included the White Oak since vessels are not excluded from corruption.Now, if any of these links were to go wrong though, the White Oak and its crew would likely be buried out at sea where the Storm Goddess\u2019s embrace awaits to receive their poor souls.This cold, even cruel law, does not come from anyone\u2019s malicious intent but the \u201cway of survival\u201d that human society has so far explored.Of course, there are also those city-states that are unwilling or fail to enforce these strict tangent rules. For that failure, their names are now concentrated in the first two volumes of the secondary school history textbooks, which are required for the final exam.Time passed minute by minute, and everyone awaiting the signal from the guardian team aboard the ship was tense and uncomfortable. There could only be two signals from this \u2013 the first being an all-was-okay from the psychic link of the clergies sitting inside the port chapel, the other a detonation of nitroglycerin on the dinghy to sink the White Oak.A big ocean-going vessel like the White Oak wouldn\u2019t have survivors if it did get deeply polluted by subspace. So, destroying the vessel wouldn\u2019t bring guilt to those watching.As Vanna crossed her arms and gently tapped the metal arm wear during this arduous wait, a sudden chime of the chapel bell caught everyone\u2019s attention, followed closely by three long whistles of the relief pipes on both sides of the bell tower.The priests in the church have received a secret message from the inspection team, and the church bells and whistles were the announcements that it\u2019s safe to dock the White Oak for a special situational report.This undoubtedly sent a wave of relief through Vanna\u2019s veins. There\u2019s no better news they could ask for.As for having a special situational report\u2026 The lady was not surprised at all. In fact, it would be strange that there wasn\u2019t after the ship bizarrely disappeared from the preplanned route.More church guardians began to board the ship once the docking procedure had been completed. Vanna didn\u2019t dally around either and led a group of highly trained priests over. She swiftly jumped over the long springboard to step onto the deck, where a gray-haired, burly captain awaited her arrival.The old captain looked a little haggard, apparently having overworked himself in a state of high tension. However, after seeing the inquisitor of the church approaching, the old man immediately raised his spirit and took the initiative to greet the lady.\u201cHello Captain Lawrence, I\u2019m Inquisitor Vanna of the Deep Sea Church.\u201d Vanna did not like the redundant etiquette and chose to get straight to the point, \u201cLet\u2019s skip the formality. First of all, I want to apologize for the reception and hope you and your crew will understand the strict inspection demanded of the authorities and church.\u201d\u201cOf course, Your Excellency,\u201d Lawrence nodded at once. He had wanted to say \u201cMiss Inquisitor,\u201d due to the lady looking no older than his own daughter, but quickly changed the wording to a more respectful title, \u201cI had expected this, after all\u2026 We lost contact for so long.\u201dVanna nodded, \u201cTell me briefly what happened to the White Oak. I want to know how you lost contact with the authorities and how you reappeared on an unplanned route. And what about the good you are tasked with escorting, Anomaly 099?\u201dAs soon as these words came out, the expression on Lawrence\u2019s face was suddenly full of frustration and nervousness. Sighing, he subconsciously glanced around before lowering his voice into a whisper: \u201cYou may not believe me when I say this, but we\u2026 met the legendary Vanished\u2026\u201dIn front of his own eyes, the stern and authoritative lady inquisitor suddenly got stiff like a stunned statue. Even the serious expression somehow appeared iced over like a frozen popsicle.Lawrence couldn\u2019t tell what that expression meant, but he got the inkling suspicion that this would\u2019ve been how he looked when they crashed through the ghost ship.\u201cInquisitor\u2026?\u201d The old captain asked cautiously, \u201cYou\u2026\u201d\u201cCaptain Lawrence,\u201d Vanna jerked back to attention like she\u2019s awoken from a daze. Staring dead into the eyes of the old sailor, \u201cRepeat that again?\u201d\u201cYou may not believe me when I say it\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m referring to the second half.\u201d\u201cWe met the legendary Vanished\u2026\u201d\u201cI believe you.\u201dThis time it was Lawrence to be stunned: \u201cThat\u2026\u201d\u201cYou may need to stay on the docks for a few more days, Captain,\u201d said Vanna with a serious face, \u201cthis matter is very, very serious. You and your crew, hold on\u2026. You encountered the Vanished, yet all your members survived?\u201dThe expression on the face of the lady suddenly got a bit ugly like there was doubt and wariness in her eyes. This didn\u2019t go unnoticed by Captain Lawrence, who promptly explained the situation: \u201cYes, my crews and I are fine, but the Vanished took away Anomaly 099. That is the doll in the coffin. I suspect the ghost ship came specifically for that puppet coffin.\u201d\u201cThe Vanished stole Anomaly 099?\u201d Vanna frowned, then asked, \u201cWhat about after that? It just let you go?\u201d\u201cYe-Yes\u2026\u201d Lawrence also became nervous and vaguely realized something, \u201cYour Excellency, is lately the city\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 It doesn\u2019t hurt to tell you; after all, it seems that your \u2018contact\u2019 may be more serious than ours now,\u201d Vanna sighed as she shot a grave look at the captain in front. \u201cCaptain Lawrence, you may not be the only person who has dealt with the Vanished recently. Let\u2019s find a quiet place. I need to know more.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 65": "Chapter 65\u00a0\u201cAlice guillotine \u201dA temporary sanctuary was eventually set up for White Oak\u2019s captain after he disembarked.The smell of incense wafted through the room that had been adorned with amulets depicting various storm runes. On top of this, priests had also set up bronze boundary tablets on all four corners to create a barrier. They also brought the Storm Code, a biblical book from the cathedral to the sanctuary \u2013 it\u2019s the eye for the defense against evil.After this was all done, Captain Lawrence entered the room with Inquisitor Vanna.\u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind our arrangement here,\u201d Vanna said lightly, maintaining the conservatism and courtesy that a high-ranking priesthood should have, \u201call for safety.\u201d\u201cOf course, everything is for safety. What I lack most now is security,\u201d Captain Lawrence immediately nodded understandingly. After looking around the room at the sacred things, he felt slightly relieved and lost some of the fatigue over his head. \u201cWith all these things around, I believe any ordinary corruption would be destroyed the second they step inside\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s most likely. Now, why don\u2019t we begin from the start? Here, you can tell me everything about the Vanished.\u201d Vanna nods in agreement and waves for the captain to begin, \u201cLet\u2019s start from where you saw the ship.\u201dCaptain Lawrence relaxed and began going over the tale of the terrible event: \u201cIt is ike this\u2026\u201dCaptain Lawrence left nothing out in front of the inquisitor lady. He even went into clear detail about what he had for breakfast that day and what time the sailors on the ship had eaten. Those of whom he couldn\u2019t remember or weren\u2019t aware of was also ordered by him to write inside the captain\u2019s log for this moment.An experienced captain knows: many anomalies are preceded by seemingly ordinary signs that individuals would disregard as the norm until it\u2019s too late. Therefore, the professional thing to do would be to review and write down everyone\u2019s experience to compare, and if the details didn\u2019t add up, that\u2019s how one would know where to look.Vanna listened carefully to the thrilling encounter until her brow furrowed up because the situation was more serious than she had imagined and more bizarre than she could ever believe.She had thought that Captain Lawrence\u2019s so-called \u201cencounter\u201d was just a face-to-face, or at best, a passing by the ghost ship from some distance. But instead, the captain described a direct head-on collision with the ghost ship and even nearly turned into an ethereal form themselves! The mere fact that they all came out alive was nothing but sheer luck!\u201cYour Excellency?\u201d Seeing that Vanna hadn\u2019t responded for a long while, the old captain grew uncomfortable and waved at the lady to return to reality, \u201cWhat is your opinion on the Vanished? Did that ship really attack us because of anomaly 099?\u201dVanna glanced at him, \u201cIsn\u2019t that what you\u2019ve always thought?\u201d\u201cI\u2026 I\u2019ve always thought so, but now I\u2019m not so sure,\u201d Lawrence sighed, \u201cespecially since you just said that the ghost captain recently extended his power to the city-state of Pland\u2026 I always felt that things would not be so simple.\u201d\u201cNo one can guess what the ghost captain thinks,\u201d Vanna shook her head, \u201cand all we can do now is conduct the most thorough inspection of the White Oak to prevent the ship from carrying any \u2018intrusions\u2019. You and your crew will also suffer some grievances for the next while since we cannot allow any of you to have contact with anyone outside of the church. This arrangement will continue until the investigation is over\u2026. this includes family visits.\u201dCaptain Lawrence bowed his head in compliance: \u201cOf course, I can understand.\u201d Then he paused before asking something else on his mind, \u201cSo\u2026 about the theft of Anomaly 099\u2026\u201dVanna knew what the captain was worried about.The eerie horror of the sea vision was a threat hanging over the heads of all civilization. Still, before considering these long-term and vast threats, the captain was foremost an ordinary folk who needed to support his family. In addition, he has lost Anomaly 099 from piracy. There\u2019s no way an average person like him could shoulder this burden.\u201cRest assured, the matter will be explained by the church to the city-state authorities and the Adventurer\u2019s Association,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cThe appearance of the Vanished is an undeniable force, and the loss of Anomaly 099 is not your responsibility. Even if it was a church ship responsible for escorting, the result might be the same.\u201dThe expression on Captain Lawrence\u2019s face visibly relaxed.But there was still another word in Vanna\u2019s mind that she didn\u2019t say: in the final analysis, \u201canomalies\u201d in itself wandered on the edge of being sealed and out of control. As a result, plenty of city dwellers would lose their lives due to this reasoning. In the face of such a dynamic imbalance, no one could be certain of anything.\u201cIn addition\u2026\u201d Captain Lawrence suddenly grew hesitant before forcing him to ask, \u201cI want to inquire, what is so special about the Anomaly 099?\u201d Speaking of this, he paused and then quickly added: \u201cOf course, when I undertook the escort job, I had received a note with the information regarding how to seal 099 and the emergency disposal method, but I never got any information regarding its background and origin. You know it too. It is an anomaly within the one hundred figures, the less normal folks like I know about it, the better. But 099 has already been abducted by the Vanished. Therefore, according to regulations, it should be counted as completely losing control. So\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s fine. It\u2019s okay to tell you now,\u201d Vanna nodded before Captain Lawrence finished. \u201cSince Anomaly 099 is no longer within the control of civilization, the next step is to release the relevant information to the Adventurers\u2019 Association and ability users within the various city-states. You are a member of the former and the last to be in contact with 099. You are entitled to the information.\u201dSpeaking of this, she contemplated for a while to sort through the information in her possession: \u201cAnomaly 099, the doll coffin. Its appearance is a gorgeous wooden box like that of a coffin with a sleeping doll inside. The doll has silver hair and wears a purple dress, and the body shape resembles that of ordinary humans.\u201d\u201cThe anomaly was initially found in the cold sea of the north. The puppet\u2019s appearance inside the coffin is extremely close to that of Queen Ray Nora, who was beheaded and executed by the rebels half a century ago. However, there is no evidence of a real connection between the two.\u201cThe anomaly does not have a tendency to think, has no consciousness, but is very likely to actively perceive the outside world and exert its influence outward.\u201d\u201cYou should be aware of the sealing method for 099 so I won\u2019t repeat that part. As for the danger it poses\u2026.\u201d\u201cFirst of all, the puppet coffin tends to \u2018settle\u2019. Once it is stuck in a certain area long enough, it will regard the area as its territory. From then onward, it will be difficult to transfer 099 to other places while gradually expanding its influence to the surrounding area. The seal on it will also weaken sharply, becoming more to losing control. It\u2019s also a common feature for a considerable number of anomalies. It\u2019s the main reason we hired you to move 099. It\u2019s to prevent excessive growth.\u201d\u201cSecondly, in the event that the puppet coffin is out of control, all humanoid units, including elves, dwarves, orcs and the likes, will be targeted within a certain range of its surroundings. The specific criteria for targeting are not clear. All we know is that the victims will immediately lose control of their freedom of movement like a puppet pulled by a string. Without exception, they will unconsciously bow down in the direction of the coffin, just like someone worshipping a queen. Once this action is completed\u2026. The victim will be immediately beheaded.\u201d\u201cThe decapitation cannot be avoided, cannot be protected, cannot be exempted, and there is no point in applying a blessing or wearing armor on the victim. The only condition for being selected is at the whim of the puppet. The victim will directly become decapitated after bowing. Only then will the puppet stay quiet for four to six hours. Afterward, it will look for the next target and repeat the cycle. Until now, no normal person has survived its selection.\u201d\u201cThe puppet coffin also has the characteristics of moving on its own during the out-of-control state. It\u2019s extremely fast, extremely powerful, and will break free of capture in various unbelievable ways. On top of all that, the coffin itself is also extremely powerful. The longer it\u2019s on the loose, the further the damage it will cause.\u201d\u201cOf the several runaway events on record about the doll coffin, only one saint has ever survived the ordeal. However, that saint also happens to have the bloodline of the northern frost city-state. We cannot be certain it is the saint\u2019s strength that prevailed or that it is the puppet coffin\u2019s forgiveness characteristic acting up.\u201dListening to the young Inquisitor\u2019s calm and indifferent narration, Captain Lawrence felt his hair standing up little by little.His first thought was: the money of the city-state authorities is really not easy to earn! No wonder the reward for escorting Anomaly 099 is almost five times that of the escort of an ordinary anomaly. This kind of total disregard for defensive measures and only needs the puppet\u2019s attention on you is impossible to dodge!At the same time, the voice of Inquisitor Vanna voice rang again to interrupt his train of thought. \u201cFor the puppet coffin\u2019s terrifying ability, the Church gave it a special name when documenting Anomaly 099, which is named after the torture device used by the rebels to execute the Frost Queen half a century ago: Alice guillotine.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 66": "Chapter 66 \u201cGood Morning On The Vanished\u201dThis Translation is hosted on https://bcatranslation.com/\u201cAlice! Take care of your head!\u201d The beautiful morning on the Vanished began with the captain\u2019s angry roar on the deck.Duncan stood outside the captain\u2019s room, his finger pointing to the head of the doll hanging from a nearby beam. He\u2019s twitching in the eye as he watches the headless doll getting up in a panic to retrieve the hanging head.With a crisp \u201cclick\u201d, Miss Doll reconnected her head back on and promptly trotted over: \u201cHehe\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t hehe me! What are you doing hanging your head above my door in the morning? Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re acting as the scout. There\u2019s a dove for that.\u201d Duncan stared at this cursed doll, which unfortunately knocked a few years off the captain\u2019s lifespan. Seriously, who wouldn\u2019t be scared silly at having a decapitated head hanging outside their room in the morning?\u201cI washed my hair in the morning\u2026\u201d Alice shrank her head down and replied meekly, \u201cMy hair wasn\u2019t drying fast enough so I wanted to hang it higher so it can catch some wind\u2026.\u201dDuncan: \u201c\u2026\u201dAlice peeks up after getting no response, \u201cCaptain\u2026 Are you angry?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026 are right.\u201d After holding his breath in, Duncan could only blurt this out while restraining the muscles in his cheeks. He had to admit. From the perspective of Alice\u2019s lifestyle, putting her head up in a higher place like the mast was indeed a good idea. Besides, other items on the ship were doing weird stuff, like taking a nap or the bucket rolling to the back for a sun tan. Nothing was normal on this ship, and it\u2019s about time the man got a bigger heart.In this respect, Alice had adapted quite well to life on the ship. This would be called \u201cmingling\u201d in if he had to put a word to it\u2026.\u201cCaptain, you\u2019re not angry!\u201d Alice immediately laughs because she has a good grasp of the captain\u2019s temperament by this point. She\u2019s still in awe of the man, but she\u2019s no longer afraid of him like on the first day and even dares to bargain for benefits, \u201cThen Captain, can I still hang my head\u2026.\u201d\u201cNo, anywhere but outside the captain\u2019s room.\u201d Duncan shot a sideway glance at the doll, \u201cI don\u2019t want to wake up in the morning and find a crewmember\u2019s head welcoming me at first light.\u201dAlice could only honestly bow her head: \u201cOh, okay\u2026.\u201dDuncan still looked at her skeptically like he didn\u2019t believe it\u2019s not going to happen again.\u201cCaptain?\u201d Alice grew a little timid by the attention, \u201cWhy do you keep staring at me\u2026?\u201d\u201cI just suddenly thought of a question,\u201d Duncan said as he pondered, \u201cyou\u2019re suffering from hair loss, right? So then\u2026 do you grow it back?\u201dAlice was stunned, her expression becoming that of a broken recorder. It took a long while until her eyes suddenly jerked to attention at the captain\u2019s implication, \u201cI\u2026 I\u2026 I didn\u2019t think about it at all! Captain you\u2026\u201dThe last few words of her sentence were borderline crying. In the end, she couldn\u2019t actually bring herself to say it aloud because \u201cCaptain, are you a devil?\u201d would surely warrant a knock on the head. On top of that, she didn\u2019t want the goat head to go on a nagging spree regarding this later.Duncan didn\u2019t care what Alice forced back down. Instead, his attention was on something else entirely: \u201cYou see? Although you can walk and jump like a normal person, but your body is that of a real puppet doll. You don\u2019t eat or drink, and joints can fall off anytime. In this case, wouldn\u2019t your hair be a non-renewable resource? The more you wash, the faster you will become bald\u2026. Wouldn\u2019t combing also worsen the condition?\u201dAlice was about to really cry, \u201cCaptain, why would you think of such a terrible thing\u2026\u201dDuncan: \u201cActually, I\u2019ve always wanted to ask you this question after eating that bowl of fish head soup.\u201dAlice was so taken aback by the soup description that she openly sniffled to pull the snot back: \u201cBut I cooked fish soup\u2026\u201dDuncan puts on a front of truth and justice: \u201cDidn\u2019t you use the fish\u2019s head in the soup? Then why isn\u2019t it fish head soup?\u201dAlice: \u201cCaptain is right\u2026.\u201dJust like that, the beautiful morning on the Vanished began with everyone\u2019s mutual recognition of reasonableness.Miss Doll left in a trance after the morning exchange. She seemed to suddenly have a lot on her plate about the future and what it foretold. Meanwhile, Duncan\u2019s mood was as giddy as it came because he had just pulled the most devilish prank on the ship. Of course, the guy also partook in his usual breakfast in the mapping room \u2013 the chopped cheese and spirit he brought from Pland \u2013 which weren\u2019t much but still delicious considering what\u2019s on the Vanished.\u201cCaptain, what happened to Miss Alice? I noticed that she had absent-mindedly returned to her quarters and slammed the door twice on the way in\u2026 Is she preoccupied with something?\u201d The goat head asks after sensing the oddity with the doll.\u201cShe\u2019s facing a major life challenge, and I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll have to worry about her fighting the items aboard the ship for a while.\u201d Duncan brought the wine glass up to his face and grinned mischievously, \u201cBut I\u2019m curious about one thing\u2026\u201d\u201cHuh? What are you curious about?\u201d\u201cDoes a cursed doll really become a bald doll once their hair falls out?\u201d Duncan begins an honest discussion with the wood figurine, \u201cShouldn\u2019t a supernatural item have supernatural powers to ensure its maintenance? Unfortunately, I couldn\u2019t dive further into the topic with Alice when she ran away.\u201dGoat\u2019s head: \u201c\u2026\u201dThe silence drew an intrigued look from Duncan, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you talking?\u201dAfter a period of being at a loss for words, the goat head finally lets loose, \u201cYou are truly the most terrifying natural disaster on the Boundless Sea\u2026. Such a question is something I can never ask.\u201dDuncan shrugged and got up from behind the mapping table.\u201cI\u2019m going to leave again,\u201d he said to the goat head and snapped his finger to summon a wisp of green flame. Immediately, Ai the dove flew down from the shelf and landed on the man\u2019s shoulder, \u201cAs usual, you are in charge of the helm while I\u2019m away.\u201d\u201cOf course Captain. As your most loyal first mate, I will not disappoint!\u201d The goat head agreed without hesitation and soundly pumped with energy, \u201cBut Captain, you\u2019ve been lately\u2026 a bit keen on spirit walking. Is there something on land that interests you?\u201dDuncan didn\u2019t respond immediately but paused to ensure he\u2019s got a good excuse, \u201cI recently discovered after a century of development, the world is more interesting than imagined.\u201dIt won\u2019t expose him for lacking knowledge by going this route, and it gave him ample reasoning to explore the land side more often in the future. If necessary, the excuse could also be used as the reason for returning the Vanished to civilization.Most importantly, the answer fits with the image of \u201cCaptain Duncan\u201d, the infamous ghost captain and the biggest natural disaster on the Boundless Sea.The goat head didn\u2019t explode like the man expected but instead took the decision for granted. \u201cOh, you\u2019re absolutely right Captain. After all these years, those city-states should\u2019ve come up with something to intrigue you. I can see why you would want to relieve your boredom\u2026. In this case, should the Vanished be prepared? Which city-state are you planning to invade? Pland? Renza? Or the one further north?\u201dOriginally Duncan was still pleased to hear the support, but as the goat head went on and turned his excuse into a full-blown invasion plan, his heart instantly sank and pulled the break. \u201cWhen did I say I want to invade a city-state? Something interesting has emerged. Wouldn\u2019t it be a shame to destroy it?\u201d\u201cAhh\u2026 right, my suggestion is too reckless. \u201cThe goat head immediately changed his attitude about the whole thing, \u201cI thought you were going to drive the ship over there in the future\u2026 of course, the idea must be voided now since there\u2019s no plan of that. In fact, this way is also very good. No matter what, those city-states do have some strength. Simply driving the ship over there is a bit risky\u2026.\u201d\u201cIn the future, don\u2019t mention invading a city-state.\u201d Duncan looked at the goat head and added another layer of insurance, \u201cWe have been derailed from the world for over a century, and now I want to regain control of the changes in civilized society, which may involve many long-term changes. Don\u2019t make superfluous plans until I have a clear order.\u201d\u201cAs you command, Captain.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 67": "Chapter 67 \u201cNew Contact\u201dThis Translation is hosted on https://bcatranslation.com/The goat head was a dangerous fellow, and Duncan knew it from the beginning\u2014not only because it was an unknown anomaly but because it had been loyal to the real Captain Duncan and still plays and thinks according to the rules of old times to this day.From the perspective of the goat head, the city-states on land are meaningless, the mortals in the city-states are stupid and ridiculous, the weak city-state fleets are all food, and plundering and hunting them\u2026 was the natural \u201ceveryday\u201d objective of the Vanished.Duncan didn\u2019t know how long it would take him to adjust the goat head\u2019s habits, but he knew the process had to be subtle \u2014 and it was the safest way to change himself and the ship.He took one last look at the goat head that was quietly waiting at the sailing table. Upon confirming that the other party had taken over the sails and rudder system of the Vanished, he then pushed the door into his bedroom.This afternoon, Nina would return to the antique shop, and before that, he had to let Ai the dove complete his test projects.Once the door to the captain\u2019s chamber was closed, the goat head quietly watched the direction of the departing captain. Only after an unknown amount of time did the wood statue sigh before softly muttering to itself: \u201cHe really didn\u2019t get affected by subspace\u2026. Oh Vanished, Oh Vanished, what did you fish up back then\u2026.\u201d\u2026\u2026Duncan had returned to the familiar dark tunnel with the shimmering strips of starlight. On one end was the Vanished\u2019s connection, the other the antique shop inside Pland. From how it looks, he no longer had to actively control his mind to be connected to both sides after practicing for so long. Even now, the man could remotely control the body inside the shop for simple daily activities.This was obviously a good thing. An antique shop owner who spends more than half the time \u201csleeping\u201d in the store would obviously be suspicious. Even if merely standing at the doorway for a minute or two would dispel a lot of unnecessary attention.Instead of immediately \u201cteleporting\u201d his main consciousness to the city-state of Pland, Duncan held out in the dark tunnel and carefully perceived the changes in the space before eventually shifting his sight to the side.In the vast darkness, Ai had transformed into her undead bony form that was sprinkling with green fire in her flight. However, he\u2019s more focused on the vague shadows hovering around the area of the bird.Among the shadows were the Sun Talisman previously brought to the Vanished, a quaint and old short dagger, a piece of cheese, a round cannonball, and a hard salted, dried fish.These are \u201ctest items\u201d that he prepared before he set out to further test Ai\u2019s ability of carrying items and the changes that might occur during the process.The short dagger was found in the cabin, once probably belonged to some sailor \u2013 it was a mindless ordinary item. The cheese was taken from the galley and had the property of not perishing, and the shells came from the ammunition depot, while the dried salted fish was one of the harvests from the last fishing venture. Actually, the fish hadn\u2019t been fully dried yet but was nevertheless hard as a rock after two days of bathing in the sun.Duncan stared at Ai, who was hovering around these shadows, and nodded slightly in approval: \u201cSo this is how you carry the items.\u201dAi flapped her wings and let out a light, sharp cry: \u201cSit firmly, sit firmly!\u201dDuncan smiled and gathered his spirit, ready to project the main consciousness forward.But at the moment of concentration, he suddenly saw a strange glimmer appear at the end of the stream that was pointing towards the city-state of Pland.Duncan immediately stopped, looking in amazement at the light that flickered among the countless dim stars\u2014the light seemed to be there, only to turn from dim to bright at the moment of his concentration. It\u2019s as if the star could sense his presence and answered his call.What is that thing?Duncan tried to lean towards the glimmer in doubt, and with just a thought, he had already crossed the vast darkness and shot towards the light. Only then did he understand this \u201cconnection\u201d. It was similar to his body on the Vanished and antique shop.This is\u2026\u2026 another spare shell to be chosen?Duncan couldn\u2019t help but have such a conjecture in his mind, but he quickly shook his head to dismiss the idea \u2013 the shimmering star in front of him was far superior in scale to those points of light representing the \u201cbody\u201d. Such a large light\u2026 It was not so much a shell to be chosen but rather a huge object that has established a connection with oneself.Without hesitation, he made up his mind and stretched out his hand to cautiously touch that star\u2026In the next second, a huge and unfamiliar \u201cperception\u201d suddenly flooded into his mind \u2013 he couldn\u2019t see the things around him, but the sense of the sea breeze blowing against his body was quite evident. There was also the sound of people talking all around, but the noise was so muddled that he couldn\u2019t discern who was talking or what topic they discussing. It\u2019s similar to someone eavesdropping through a thick drapery.Duncan had a vague awareness he must be perceiving through some sort of behemoth structure; otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t be having so much trouble making out the words. However, there\u2019s also the possibility of an outside force interfering with his connection. Regardless of what the answer was, the ghost captain caught enough of the words that it was a tense and solemn atmosphere on the other side. Eventually, he finally managed to make out one name that repeatedly came up \u2013 the White Oak.Taking his hand back from the light stream, Duncan watched the star that\u2019s showing a shadow of a ship in the tear with a look of surprise.The White Oak\u2026 The name seemed a little familiar, but I can\u2019t quite remember when I heard it.Duncan thought hard to recall the name. Finally, through much effort and rummaging, he understood it must be the same ship that had collided with the Vanished from before.Immediately afterward, he also remembered the newspaper he had bought in the city-state of Pland. At that time, a section of the paper had mentioned the incident about that ocean-going ship being missing for several days but would soon make port\u2026.For a while, Duncan didn\u2019t know what to make of this and fell into a daze because this was the White Oak, the ship responsible for escorting Anomaly 099.The old captain who had tried to talk to me seems to have finally reached Pland, and apparently the ship has made a connection with me.Could it be that the connection was established after the original \u201cspirit world ship collision\u201d accident? Because the flames of the Vanished at that time extended to the White Oak?Duncan had a faint conjecture in his mind, speculating on the various attributes of his ghost flame while also wondering if his connection to the steamship could be of any use.After drifting aboard Vanished for so long, he valued every connection between himself and the civilized world.Now it seems that although the White Oak has docked, it was still in a certain state of blockade and surveillance. As for those nervous people humming around to make so much noise, they should be the \u201cprofessionals\u201d of the city-state who specialize in dealing with extraordinary visions.Clearly, a ship that had been lost at sea was dangerous for the people of the city-state, and the experience of close contact with the Vanished may also be a major pending matter.Duncan had enough awareness to know the sort of reputation his ghost ship held.After thinking about it for a while, Duncan cautiously stepped back and did not continue to touch the light in front of him.As the number one boss on the Boundless Sea, he did not intend to deal with the city-state\u2019s protectors without knowing the details of the \u201cpower users\u201d in their roster. Also, keeping the White Oak as an anchor for future use was better than exposing it now and being destroyed.At that time, maybe he could finally talk to the old captain calmly instead of that messy brief encounter smothered by the wind.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 68": "Chapter 68 \u201cReliable Dove Express\u201dThis Translation is hosted on https://bcatranslation.com/A cool sea breeze suddenly blew across the deck, causing Captain Lawrence, who had just walked outside, to rub his arm subconsciously\u2014he didn\u2019t know if the feeling of goosebumps was due to the cool sea breeze or what the young inquisitor had told him.Anomaly 099, the puppet coffin, after losing control, not only has the ability to move and the tendency to get out of trouble, but could also continuously expand its sphere of influence towards any target within its range. The consequence was the unconditional decapitation of the victim, and the only ones that could resist were saints\u2026.To think for the past half a month, he and his crew have been dealing with this dangerous anomaly \u2013 even though the escort journey has never been dangerous except for the final encounter with the Vanished, he still feels a little scared in retrospect.However, it was just fear on his part since that\u2019s all in the past now.As a member of the Adventurer\u2019s Association and a veteran ocean explorer, his job was to work with the Boundless Sea. However, unlike fishermen who only operate in safe offshore areas, he has spent most of his sailing career dealing with Anomalies and even Visions.When undertaking an Anomaly delivery job, the authorities or churches would inform the transportation crew in advance of the dangers. This part was often the shortest part of the entire commission contract, usually with only one message: this task is fatally dangerous, and the specific details cannot be divulged.Every captain who earned a living by traveling between city-states knew what he was facing, and more than half of them would eventually be entangled by this deadly career in their later years.For Captain Lawrence, many of his colleagues of the same age have retired by now, either trapped in incessant nightmares or suffering from mental problems caused by various degrees of curses. In some cases, disabilities are also included due to a long voyage or worse\u2026.Of course, equal compensation was rewarded for such a dangerous job. Unlike commoners scraping by in the city-states, captains of a ship would never have to worry about their retirement funds. Unfortunately, that\u2019s the least of a captain\u2019s worry because the occupational diseases are abundant.Captain Lawrence had no delusions of being a nobleman. He did this mainly to earn money on top of his passion for exploring the sea. But like most people, the passion of youth doesn\u2019t always earn one a healthy lifestyle, and now\u2026. he\u2019s starting to feel his enthusiasm and passion burning out.While my mental health is still normal, while the Boundless Sea hasn\u2019t yet entangled my fate yet, it\u2019s best I find time to retire.Lawrence sighed slightly, turned, and slowly walked back towards the captain\u2019s room.The priests\u2019 search and questioning of the entire ship were not over yet, and he could not abandon the White Oak until then. Afterwards though, he and his crew would be transferred for isolation and observation, as well as a series of psychiatric tests by the authorities.His gaze eventually swept over the familiar onboard facilities around him after coming aboard.It\u2019s an excellent new ship with only five years of service. Honestly, Lawrence seriously felt reluctant to retire so early on, but\u2026. it\u2019s either early retirement or the likelihood of spending his life in the insane asylum.\u2026\u2026In the city-state downtown, in the old antique shop, the middle-aged man lying on the bed back on the second floor had slowly come to. In his view was a moldy ceiling reflecting into Duncan\u2019s field of vision.\u201cPhew\u2026\u201d Duncan exhaled softly, feeling the perception from this body quickly clearing up and stabilizing. After two to three seconds, he braced those arms and pushed himself up.Ai also flies over then, her beak chirping loudly: \u201cHoney, welcome home. Do you want dinner first or a bath first, or perhaps\u2026.\u201dDuncan was about to stretch his limbs when he cramped up over the last word. Without hesitation, he slapped the dove as punishment: \u201cWhy in the world would you say something like that?!\u201dAi was obviously an extraordinary bird because she didn\u2019t get fazed in the slightest. Briskly flapping her wings and chirping loudly: \u201cBoowww, a punch for a nosebleed, a nosebleed for a crooked nose, a crooked nose and nosebleed for a sauce shop\u2026.\u201dDuncan didn\u2019t know if he should suffocate this dove at this point because his brain honestly couldn\u2019t keep up. Then turning to look at the table, he saw the various test items he had prepared from the Vanished: sun talisman, dagger, cheese, a cannonball, and a salted fish.Everything\u2019s here, and it doesn\u2019t look like Ai had any sort of packet loss during the transfer.This bird is more reliable than I thought.Duncan stepped forward and visually checked each item for any damages and found none. This improved his mood and even changed his annoyed look on Ai, who was still acting silly on the bed and spouting dumb things.Ai: \u201cOld treasonous bastard will be butchered. On guard you sly dog!\u201dDuncan: \u201c\u2026\u201dRealizing he was the dumb one for even thinking about praising the bird, he sat down on the chair and checked the goods some more with his ghost fire for an in-depth review.The first was the Sun Talisman, which has not changed \u2013 as an supernatural item that has been completely transformed and controlled by the ghost fire, it still lingered with a flicker of his power.The dagger, which did not possess supernatural attributes, did not look any different. Except for the ancient style, its blade was still sharp, and the scabbard was well-maintained.Afterward, Duncan\u2019s gaze fell on the piece of cheese that had come out of the Vanished\u2019s kitchen. The cheese was not acting strange or smelled rotten. It\u2019s still edible according to his judgement.Now then, it was the cannonball\u2019s turn. He was curious about this one because he knew this metal ball was one of those active items aboard the ship.Duncan tapped the iron shell and attempted to get feedback \u2013 nothing came.On the Vanished, he knows certain objects had a \u201cmind\u201d of their own, while some are a collective hive with multiple subunits. This cannonball was part of those subunits so his experiment here was to see if the shell could connect with the main hive back on the ship. Since there\u2019s no feedback, it could only mean the shell has become no more than a lump of metal.Duncan mused over this discovery and started expanding his idea.If I start taking back shells to the Vanished, would they also be recognized as a sub-unit of the ammunition depot on the Vanished?If yes, then that means I can replenish the ammunition aboard. But what criteria must I meet?I know the cannonballs I used to sink Alice\u2019s coffin didn\u2019t return so there must be a range limit.And what about upgrading the artillery system? Cannonballs are from the last century, meaning they\u2019re likely outdated by now. Can I use more advanced shelling?Actually, if I can replenish the ammo aboard, wouldn\u2019t that mean I can also add new facilities and equipment to the vessel? For example, I might not even need to use cannons anymore and instead replace them all with something higher-tech!I can also improve the living conditions aboard! Maybe a new bed or a sofa?Duncan couldn\u2019t help but salivate on the possibilities.The more he came into contact with the modern city-state of Pland, the more he felt that the Vanished needed to be improved upon. Glamor from a century ago doesn\u2019t mean anything in modern times. Sure, a ghost ship\u2019s weird and terrifying power would bring fear to any sailor, but it had no electric lighting, no processing chips of a computer, no missile systems, and most of all, no boiler for hot showers!Oh right, there\u2019s also no French fries aboard for Ai.Duncan silently glanced at the dove, who had jumped out onto the windowsill staring off into the distance.Sensing the attention, Ai looked back with those mung bean eyes and chirped: \u201cBuy some fries from the dock???\u201d\u201cShut up, don\u2019t mention fries.\u201d Duncan rebuffed the bird before turning his attention to the last item.The salted fish was a pure and natural processed item gifted to him by nature. It tastes good, smells good, and belongs to the items outside of the Vanished.After experiencing the spirit walk, this salted fish didn\u2019t seem to change much either.Let\u2019s have Nina turn it into a stew this evening.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 69": "Chapter 69 \u201cCity-State Life\u201dThis Translation is hosted on https://bcatranslation.com/After inspecting all the test items, Duncan now has a further understanding of the bird\u2019s transportation ability and the capacity she held.Ai could transport several different items simultaneously, including organic, inorganic, supernatural, and ordinary things. The type of goods would not affect the stability of her power, and the transportation process would not affect the goods\u2019 nature.The transportation ability also doesn\u2019t seem to consume much of her \u201cenergy\u201d either. Whether it was the ritual dagger at the beginning, or a bunch of things at once, the bird was still bouncing around as ever. Of course, this may be because the total amount of \u201ccargo\u201d she has transported so far was too small and didn\u2019t hit the bottleneck.Regardless, further testing was still in order regarding Ai\u2019s \u201cweight\u201d and \u201cvolume\u201d limit.Duncan summarized the currently known information one by one, and only after confirming that everything was in place did he breathe a sigh of relief.He knows that the tests done so far are still very much imperfect, and many possible variables have not been carefully considered. Moreover, even from the perspective of \u201ctest subjects\u201d, the samples he selected are too small to accumulate valid data.In the future, he will select more types of different weights and volumes. Only then could he call the data reliable.Duncan was very cautious in this regard, and this caution wasn\u2019t without reason \u2013 because he has a very bold plan\u2026 or idea in mind.Since Ai could teleport items between land and the Vanished intact without limiting what type of items they are, then\u2026 wouldn\u2019t she be able to ship people as well?Like, someone that\u2019s not so human? For example\u2026. Alice?Duncan knows that a single person\u2019s strength is limited. With only his ability to walk in the spirit world to link the ship with the city-states, it would just be a matter of time before he encounters a problem of insufficient manpower. However, if there\u2019s a helper around, the situation would be much better. As it so happens, Ai\u2019s ability has given him a lot of room to work with.Of course, Alice was not a good candidate. This numbered anomaly called 099 \u2013 although elegant and mysterious when sitting quietly \u2013 was in essence a useless and cowardly doll that could hardly do anything right.Remembering that his only crewmember available to him was an individual who could actually stew her own head during cooking was enough to make any man sigh in agony.The positioning of the Vanished as a world-class enemy was truly a headache. Let\u2019s say he did go out and recruit more sailors. What then? The ones that would dare apply would probably be villainous crooks themselves. You know, the type that goes pirate robbing on Monday and Wednesday, then demon sacrificing on Tuesday and Friday, and then finally guerrilla warfare with the church on weekends\u2026But that\u2019s a plus in retrospect. At least those crooks would easily mingle with the goat head, who\u2019s constantly yapping about invading a city-state.\u201c\u2026\u2026 Aigh, Alice is at least honest and obedient,\u201d Duncan sighed and stood up, muttering to himself, \u201cIf I properly train her, she can grow up properly too\u2026 probably.\u201dEven if she can\u2019t be a helper, it is good nevertheless to let that doll see the world. After all, it won\u2019t be good to keep her so clueless and lacking in common sense.After sorting out his thoughts, Duncan began to pack up the things he had brought with him \u2013 he would not return them to the Vanished for the time being,There aren\u2019t many places to hide things on the second floor of the antique shop, and Nina was always there to clean up his room. So having some random items around would surely be suspicious, especially when one of them was a century-old cannonball. But after a short contemplation, Duncan found some suitable places to hide them. The sun talisman could be kept on his body, the salted fish would go directly into the kitchen, and the cannonball and dagger were even easier to dispose of.Without delay, Duncan took the two most suspicious items downstairs and directly placed them in a corner next of the counter. This was an antique shop, and having more or less old relics lying around and piled up couldn\u2019t be any more normal. Well, calling this an antique shop was a compliment since almost everything on the first floor are counterfeits\u2026.As for the last one, the cheese he grabbed from the Vanished\u2019s kitchen, Duncan also found a good place for it \u2013 in the trash.After dealing with all this, Duncan patted the nonexistent dust on his hands and smiled with a very satisfied grin over the arrangement.Then he glanced at the sky outside, where the \u201csun\u201d confined by the double rune ring was hanging high in the sky.Nina would return home later today, before which he plans to go out to learn more about the city. It doesn\u2019t seem like there\u2019s any business today anyways.Since the weather was a little cool, Duncan changed into a dark brown coat and groomed his somewhat messy hair before going out. This was his way of making this old and tattered body look a bit more refreshed after being tormented by drugs and alcohol for so long.Once out and walking, Duncan didn\u2019t need to wait before the sound of flapping wings came from the second floor. It was Ai who flew down to land on his shoulders while pressing her head triumphantly against his: \u201cTo the Erxian Bridge, then take the Chenghua Avenue\u2026\u201dDuncan shot a sideway glance at this bird. He had initially planned to keep the dove home to watch house; after all, when going outside, having a bird on his shoulder was too eye-catching and weird. What\u2019s more, his connection with the bird would allow him to summon the dove whenever he likes. Of course, taking her along wouldn\u2019t mean a thing, but now, Ai had taken the liberty of using this opening to tag along on her own accord for a car ride.Looking at the triumphant appearance of this bird, Duncan finally smiled helplessly and sighed: \u201c\u2026 Forget it. Follow if you like it.\u201dWith this arrangement, the pair took the main road opposite to the antique shop and continued until the man overheard the crisp sound of a bell ringing.Looking over, Duncan could see a double-decker bus with a brown and blue striped paint job driving along the main tracks until it stopped next to a station not far away.It was the common form of public transport in the city-state of Pland, a vehicle powered by a steam engine. By spending a fare of six pesos \u2013 affordable by most lower-sector citizens of the city \u2013 one could ride the bus according to the preplanned route as long as one wished.From what Duncan could discern according to the map displayed along the pole sign up ahead, this bus route went around the city and then eventually up into the higher sector, only stopping and making a round trip at an area called the \u201cCrossroad\u201d.Duncan had an image of this \u201cCrossroad\u201d from the memory fragments. This neighborhood was regarded as the \u201cjunction\u201d of the city, the most prosperous commerce area with decent housing arrangements. Many lower residents regarded this neighborhood as their dream goal in life, while many middle-class citizens who could not afford such an expensive upscale arrangement would also try their best to live as close as possible to that spot since it had almost everything in terms of facilities \u2013 theaters, museums, and several upscale restaurants.Nina\u2019s school was also near the Crossroad, and the museum she mentioned wanting to visit was also located in that area.Duncan thought for a moment, then quickly walked to the station and got on before the bus started again.There was hardly anyone on the bus as he chcked, only partially full with the first floor entirely devoid of passengers. However, there was the driver in his seat and the dark blue uniformed conductor standing ready to take his fare. The young woman had simple makeup and a short haircut, but that friendly smile was as genuine as it came until she noticed the dove on Duncan\u2019s shoulder.\u201cSorry, pets are not allowed on board. It\u2019s the rule,\u201d the young woman said uncomfortably, pointing up to the bird on Duncan\u2019s shoulder, \u201cincluding doves.\u201dDuncan looked at Ai, who flapped her wings innocently and tilted her head to look at him.\u201cGo to the roof of the car.\u201d\u201cCoo, coo.\u201d Ai flapped her wings and flew out of the car, \u201ccooing\u201d all the while in protest.The young conductor lady appeared almost speechless at this weird display of man and bird communicating together.\u201cIs it okay now?\u201d Duncan waved at the conductor, who seemed to be in a daze over his actions and pointed to the roof. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t mind a bird riding on the car roof, right?\u201dOnly then did the conductor react: \u201cAh\u2026 Yes\u2026\u2026 The fare is six pesos for a pass.\u201dDuncan reached into his pocket and pulled two coins for the blue ticket, then found a window seat and sat quietly to enjoy his first car ride in the world.Accompanying the vibration and mechanical friction was the engine starting up, followed by the ringing of the bell in the front for the time of departure. The scenery gradually receded outside the window as Duncan comfortably leaned back in his seat.Steam is a good thing, civilized society is a good thing, scientific and technological progress is a good thing\u2026.If I get a chance, I must get myself a seating like this as well on the Vanished. The old wooden chairs are not comfortable at all. Oh right, I mustn\u2019t forget a boiler. It\u2019s just not right doing without a hot shower.As soon as his thoughts were spreading into other areas, the guy suddenly felt a short rumble in the car as it came to a crawl, eventually to a stop.\u201cYou coming on? There are seats still!\u201d The young conductor pushed open the window near the front and shouted outside.Duncan was startled and chuckled dumbly at himself. Apparently he\u2019s still a stranger to this world because he had forgotten how lively life could be in a typical city.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 70": "Chapter 70 \u201cI\u2019m One Of You\u201dThis Translation is hosted on https://bcatranslation.com/How do ordinary people survive in a world with supernatural visions, where the lands are blocked by endless oceans and where anomalies and city-state are constantly engaged in endless fighting?Duncan still lacked knowledge of the world, but at least in the places he saw, the ordinary folks of this place still lived in an environment of relative stability and order.They worked, they studied, they rested, they run their own shops, they mingled, they go out on their days off, they go to the theaters and restaurants, they go to the parks and ports, they visited museums, they gossiped with their neighbors after dinner, they did everything a person would when living a not so exciting but nominally secure life.Duncan sat in his seat, curiously observing everything around him as the ordinary folks went about their daily lives. From what he perceived, they\u2019re not much different from those on Earth aside from the supernatural bits.The bus stopped again upon approaching the Crossroad, and this time many passengers boarded.Duncan continued to stare curiously out the window at this location. There are plumes of steam coming out of the chimney chutes, as well as crisscrossing pipes connecting the various buildings along the streets. But suddenly, the man was alarmed when an inexplicable surge of heat rose from his chest.Glancing down, he realized it had come from the sun talisman hanging around his neck!Naturally, Duncan was stunned by this discovery. Out of reflex, he touched the spot covered by his shirt and felt the temperature with his fingers. It\u2019s not only hot but actually slightly vibrating.He didn\u2019t know what was going on, but it was clear that the talisman resonated with something nearby\u2014through the connection he had established with the item, he quickly locked onto a figure outside the car window speeding through the crowd.The person wore an ordinary black coat that gave no sign he was any different from the passersby; however, Duncan\u2019s certain the talisman was pointing at him.Without hesitation, he immediately got up from his seat and marched towards the exit while sending a mental message to Ai. The bird immediately jumped off the bus roof and landed on the man\u2019s shoulder.The conductor standing near the door watched in amazement, and only after Duncan got off the bus did she mutter: \u201cHow did he train that dove\u2026\u201dBut then this little episode of daily life quickly receded from the conductor\u2019s attention as the wave of passengers boarded the steam bus: \u201cThis spot to buy tickets. Children also need to buy. Hey, this kid is taller than one meter\u2026. Four years old? This can\u2019t be four years old. Look, he must buy a ticket if he crosses this measuring line!\u201dBy now, Duncan had already marched into the crowd and entered an intersection while tracking that black coat.The suspicious individual clearly had a purpose in how swift and agile he moved through the dense collage of people. In fact, it didn\u2019t take more than a minute for Duncan to lose sight of the black coat.Thankfully, the resonance from the sun talisman remains, and the feedback from the item told the antique shop owner which direction he needed to go.Duncan thought quickly as he followed the guidance.There is no doubt that the black coat is suspicious, and this talisman must have sensed something to react so strongly\u2026 Perhaps, it perceived a homologous power from the \u201creal sun god\u201d.From the goat head, Duncan had already learned that the talisman had the function of identifying and blessing fellow citizens who followed the black sun. However, under normal circumstances, only the faithful could use this function or perceive the guiding effect of the talisman.Duncan had usurped control of the item with his ghost fire, but at the time, he thought that his flame had destroyed most of the talisman\u2019s abilities, but now it seems\u2026 the recognition ability of this thing was still there!It\u2019s just that this recognition ability was now being used at his own discretion\u2026.Guided by the talisman, he gradually left the main road crowded with passersby and gradually walked into a deserted path after three turns.Here, Duncan saw the suspicious figure again\u2014the person was speeding past the intersection ahead, seemingly oblivious to the addition of a tailing tracker behind himself.Then the talisman on his chest grew a little hotter again, and the resonance became clearer as well.Duncan quietly drove the ghost fire inside, reading the information from this sun talisman with his mind.It felt subtle\u2014even though the item had no thinking properties, Duncan could feel the excitement from the talisman conveying through himself. It\u2019s telling him where the other believers are to the point that Duncan wants to remind the thing to be more reserved. For real, not long ago, this sacred relic still belonged to a heretic of the black sun. It doesn\u2019t need to be so excited to rat its former creators out.At the same time, Duncan became more and more confident that he was approaching a secret meeting place where many followers had gathered. This proves his theory that the gathering in the sewer was no more than a small slice of the bigger pie.He didn\u2019t know what the cultists were trying to do now, but he did know one thing \u2013 they knew more about the ancient history of this world than Nina\u2019s history teacher.To understand the deeper secrets of this world, it was necessary to contact the forces of the transcendent realm. The authorities and church would be difficult to approach, but cultists on the other hand are much simpler to mingle with\u2026.If anything, he could just beat them up if they refused!It\u2019s then his train of thought came to a halt. In front of him was a dead end, and the sneaky black coat had slipped into a nearby alley. On top of this, more \u201csiblings\u201d were coming up from behind \u2013 at least that\u2019s what the talisman sensed.Duncan silently pulled up the lapels of his coat, hiding half of his face in the collar with the process. Almost the next second after the action was done, a series of footsteps could be heard from the nearby buildings.One after another, figures appeared.It was about a dozen people wearing attires no different from any common citizen. Like an assassin wouldn\u2019t walk outside in broad daylight, these cultists wouldn\u2019t hold a sign claiming to be heretics either. Nevertheless, the constant heat and directional signal from the sun talisman was all the convincing Duncan needed to confirm their identity.While he examined the group, the group was also eyeing him warily until a young tall, and thin man whispered something to his companion on the side.\u201cThis is private land. What are you sneaking around here for?\u201d The tall and thin man spoke. He seemed to be trying to create an impression that they\u2019re all good-abiding citizens, and Duncan was in fact the suspicious trespasser.Duncan murmured inside that he was really not cut out to be a spy because he didn\u2019t know what lie he should make in this situation. But then a naughty idea popped up in his head. What if he acts stupid and refuses to leave? Would these cultists attack him? Or would they pretend to be thugs and mug him?\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear me?\u201d The tall and thin man frowned and said impatiently. At the same time as his voice fell, the figures around him quietly took half a step forward, faintly forming an encirclement, \u201cI\u2019m talking to you\u2026\u201dDuncan shrugged his shoulders, casually touched the sun talisman from his chest, and said sincerely: \u201cI\u2019m one of you.\u201dLet\u2019s mingle in first. Maybe I can get something out of them. No need to waste this chance.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 71": "Chapter 71 \u201cGathering In The Gutter\u201dThis Translation is hosted on https://bcatranslation.com/There were a few seconds of silence the moment Duncan took out the sun talisman. Eventually, the tall and thin-looking boss suddenly lowered his voice and said urgently: \u201cPut that away! There might be eyes of the church nearby!\u2019Does this talisman really work? Is this thing so convincing among the Sunists?Duncan became happy in his heart, but he still maintained a mysterious posture of covering half his face. Then speaking lightly after putting away the talisman: \u201cIf the church does have an eye here, they would be more attracted to a large group like you guys gathering together instead of my talisman.\u201dAs soon as his voice fell, a bearded man on the opposite side subconsciously spoke: \u201cNo, our group will only attract the police at most since we won\u2019t disturb the social order\u2026\u201d\u201cShut up!\u201d The tall, thin leader immediately hushed the underling with a glare before returning his gaze to Duncan, \u201cThis is a necessary caution; after all, this city is very unsafe now. You come closer and don\u2019t make any superfluous movement.\u201dWhile Duncan calmly walked towards the opposite side, the other party continued to keep a vigilant eye on him. Only after they\u2019re close enough did the thin, tall guy ask: \u201cAre you a local believer in this city?\u201dDuncan thought for a moment and nodded: \u201cYes.\u201dThe original owner of the body did live in the city, and he now lives in the city, and on these easy questions, he decided to tell the truth.His plan was simple: find a way to fish in troubled waters and blend in among these cultists. This way, he could catch any news that might arise and perhaps ask more questions without exposure. Of course, in the worst-case scenario, he could always let Ai transform and bird them up!The tall and thin man didn\u2019t notice the dangerous thoughts running wild in the \u201ccompatriots\u201d heart, \u201cAs far as I know, the Storm Church attacked the local branch several days ago\u2026.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. The assembly in the sewers several days ago was a disaster. The ceremony got out of control, and we lost a lot of people as a result. But I escaped.\u201dDuncan said this without psychological burden because it\u2019s technically the truth. Even so, the ghost captain could clearly feel the tense atmosphere around him from these people after his announcement. Hurrying to correct his careless remark, \u201cThere were three others like me who escaped, but we were separated afterward. I can no longer get in contact with them anymore. Then I met you through the sun\u2019s guidance.\u201dThe tall and thin man snorted noncommittally, and then his gaze fell on the guy\u2019s shoulder: \u201cWhat is that?\u201d\u201cMy pet,\u201d Duncan said casually, \u201ccan\u2019t you see? It\u2019s just an ordinary dove.\u201dAi bent her head at the right time and made a loud \u201ccooing\u201d sound.\u201cThis dove is so loud\u2026\u201d The tall and thin man seemed to finally relax his vigilance, probably subconsciously thinking a guy who\u2019s been taught to abide by the rules from the church wouldn\u2019t have the habit of running around in the city with a bird pet. \u201cFollow me. It\u2019s not safe to talk outside.\u201dDuncan immediately breathed a sigh of relief in his heart. Finally, his plan to fish in troubled waters seemed to have worked.Then he followed the cultists and went deeper into the alley.The alley ran longer than Duncan had imagined, leading to this city\u2019s most decrepit slums. Then after passing through another old steam-releasing pipe system, through sewage paths, and winding into a low, dilapidated complex of buildings, Duncan finally got his first glimpse of what it truly means to be impoverished in this world.He thought the shop where he and Nina lived was already at the bottom of society, but now, what the antique shop represented could only be called lavish in the lower sectors.Most of the dilapidated houses lining the road are lifeless and looked abandoned for some time, but a few did seem to give off a small life presence through the windows. Likely some homeless folks hiding in this forgotten part of the city had taken residence, and they\u2019re now watching these uninvited guests who intruded upon their turfs.But in the end, these lifeless eyes were quickly retracted\u2014the dozen or so intruders were obviously enough to make any homeless folk cower in fear.\u201cSee, this is the most prosperous city-state on the Boundless Sea, Pland,\u201d the man in black who first caught Duncan\u2019s attention muttered. \u201cIt\u2019s the same everywhere you go. Whether it\u2019s the other human settlements or the elves\u2019 Wind Harbor that they call the promised land of peace and justice, it is all like this in the slums. How much of this world\u2019s light can actually reach these souls you think?\u201dDuncan didn\u2019t reply to that comment but glanced up towards the steam-spewing pipes coming down from the upper sector of the city and industrial area \u2013 everything around the pipes was giving off an unpleasant stench of chemicals and sewage.Though he didn\u2019t live in this city for long, Duncan had no trouble understanding why urban cancerous cells like these cultists would pop up again and again then.Silently giving the indignant man in black a nod, Duncan decides to keep his opinion to himself instead of lashing out.Regardless of what the reason being \u2013 seduced by the sun cult or persecution by life \u2013 the fact remains that these twisted heretics are kidnapping innocent civilians from these slums to sacrifice in their sick rituals.As a \u201cforeigner\u201d who didn\u2019t know enough about the world, Duncan had no right to judge them too much for the time being. However, from a former sacrifice\u2019s perspective, his opinion of these cultists could only be very negative.In silence, he finally reached the stronghold of these cultists.The base was located in the underground parts of an abandoned factory. Somehow, these cultists always seem to know which gutter to use as their gathering place to avoid detection, or perhaps there are just that many sewers in this prosperous steam city to tap.Anyways, after climbing over a collapsed brick wall fencing the property and opening an iron gate to the basement, Duncan was quickly ushered in and down into an open-styled room.It was a warehouse type of place, or it could have been a mechanical room at some point. Regardless of what it was meant to function as, the basement had been emptied out, and only the plumbing system remained on the ceiling. There are still some gas lamps hanging on the walls, but those could no longer be lit \u2013 dark spaces are dangerous \u2013 so the cultists avoided any area that their greased torches couldn\u2019t reach. Eventually, they arrived before a larger group of cultists already waiting for them.Duncan observed the individuals gathered here in the wide basement with some surprise, and likewise, the cultists were also watching him with wary and caution. To them, Duncan was a stranger and must be kept on watch with vigilance, which they acted on by surrounding him.Frowning at this stance: \u201cWhat, you must search me again after coming inside? I didn\u2019t know there was such a rule.\u201d\u201cIf you are really a spy from the church then a body search is useless.\u201d The tall thin man rummaged through his pocket and pulled out a cloth strip to hand over to Duncan, \u201cRelax, merely a more rigorous verification process. This is all for caution. We have lost far too many compatriots over the past few years due to various reasons. Take it and recite after me.\u201dDuncan glanced at the object handed over by the other party and saw that it was a dirty strip of cloth. At first glance, it looked no different from a torn fabric of an old shirt stained by blood.Is this another prop for the suntists to verify their fellow believers?Duncan was a little surprised in his heart, lamenting that this was really a group worthy of being hunted by the professionals from the church. Day in and day out hiding in the dark crevices of society has honed their skills to a level where they are watching out for spies and outsiders at every minute.\u201cIn the name of the sun, may the light of the Lord shine\u2026\u201dDuncan immediately got a familiar sensation after hearing that chant \u2013 just days ago a cultist had said something similar to him and also handed a talisman over!Without anyone noticing, he quietly seeped a spark of green flame into the seemingly ordinary strip of cloth in his hand. Only after doing this did Duncan follow the chanting prayer with a straight face, which naturally remained quiet to the praying mantra.Finally nodding after a brief period of unresponsiveness, the cultist appeared pleased and smiled while retrieving the cloth, \u201cWelcome back to the glory of the Lord, my fellow brother.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 72": "Chapter 72 \u201cThe Information From The Meeting\u201dThis Translation is hosted on https://bcatranslation.com/To be fair, these cultists are actually quite cautious.They didn\u2019t believe the strange \u201ccompatriot\u201d just because Duncan took out the sun talisman, nor did they easily believe him because he explained what happened on the sacrifice grounds. Instead, they observed Duncan\u2019s words and deeds along the way and even conducted an additional verification procedure to confirm the stranger\u2019s identity after arriving at the assembly hall \u2013 they had done their best in terms of being cultists in hiding.But all of their screening measures assumed Duncan was a \u201cnormal human being\u201d. That\u2019s a mistake and likely a serious one.The tall, skinny little leader retrieved the inconspicuous strip of cloth from Duncan, seemingly completely unaware of the change in the power of this sacred object. Then, pointing to the corner of the assembly hall: \u201cCompatriot, rest over there first. You are not the only new face here.\u201dDuncan nodded and walked to that inconspicuous corner while paying attention to every face in the basement.Unlike what he had seen in the sewer grounds before, he was surprised to find that none of the Sun worshippers wore the iconic black robes that were unique to their religion but dressed like ordinary citizens despite some still wearing black clothes.He asked the cultist beside him curiously: \u201cDon\u2019t we need to hide our face?\u201dThe cultists he questioned looked surprised: \u201c\u2026 Do you native believers in Pland hide your faces when you meet?\u201dDuncan immediately frowned slightly: \u201cYou are not from Pland\u2026\u201d\u201cWe came from Lunsa,\u201d another believer next to him said calmly. After confirming that the stranger in front of him was really a member of the sun faith, the followers here were obviously letting their guard down. \u201cEveryone here only managed to settle down last week, but before we could contact the local branch, the attack happened\u2026\u201d\u201cEveryone here is from Lunsa?\u201d Duncan was a little surprised as he realized why there were so many suntists in the city despite the big event several days ago.\u201cMhmm, most of us are compatriots from Lunsa, but there are also other members from other city-states that gathered at the calling.\u201d Another believer next to him joined the conversation, \u201cAlas, you have more or less heard about the situation here, so I won\u2019t repeat it. For the past four years, those damn hounds from the Storm Church have been fighting our cause\u2026. It must\u2019ve been hard on you all who stayed behind in Pland. Thankfully that\u2019s in the past now.\u201dDuncan nodded noncommittally and then heard the believer he questioned before speak again: \u201cThis dove on your shoulder is real\u2026 unusual.\u201dTwitching out of his eye, he knew Ai\u2019s presence would draw a lot of attention, but the ghost captain didn\u2019t expect this level of a draw.Acting casually: \u201cThis is my pet. It can help me do a lot of things.\u201dDespite the bland appearance, the thoughts in his mind were already running wild at what he had gathered: a large number of Sun followers were pouring into the city-state of Pland and they\u2019re planning something big!To think my little scheme of fishing in troubled waters is actually paying off!At the same time, he also understood why the cultists attending the rally here did not hide their faces. Unlike the local natives, these outsiders didn\u2019t need such an arrangement. They already knew each other from the start and mostly came from the same city-state. Moreover, they lacked the experience and discipline that came about in Pland due to the constant purging from the Storm Church.In retrospect, dressing casually also had its benefits. If the meeting did get bombed by the authorities, these folks could just make a run for it through the crowds and blend in. By then, who could tell who\u2019s who?Then suddenly, Duncan detected a gaze shooting his way. Immediately looking over, he locked onto the owner according to his intuition \u2013 a petite girl with short black hair standing more than ten meters away.The girl wore a black dress embellished with white lace, her face was beautiful and calm, and she looked about the same age as Nina. However, the most striking thing was not any of the details mentioned, but the dark red ring with a delicate silver bell hanging from the neck. This trinket gave the girl a cute but particularly strange appearance.The girl naturally turned her gaze elsewhere once the man looked over\u2014she shifted silently to avoid eye contact, but it was obvious the girl knew she\u2019s been caught!Why is there such a young kid in this gang of cultists?Duncan couldn\u2019t help but wonder in his heart. He got this strange inkling sensation that, unlike the cultists here, the girl didn\u2019t belong in this environment.While thinking about it, the sound of the door shaft turning suddenly interrupted the noise, followed by the thin, tall cult leader ordering the exit to be closed and for them to gather at the center.Duncan collected his thoughts and paid close attention to the changes on the scene. Eventually, the man at the center spread his arms to showcase a familiar item in his hand.It was a pale golden sun mask\u2014precisely the same mask worn on the face of the cult priest who presided over the sacrifice ritual during Duncan\u2019s first spirit walk.\u201cHonor to the glory of the Lord, we shall now silently recite the mantra under the Lord\u2019s gaze,\u201d said the tall, thin man in a reverent tone. \u201cBow down to this blessed mask, and may the shelter of the heirs of the sun support me and guide my brothers and sisters.\u201dThe surrounding worshippers immediately chanted the name of the real sun god in unison while making a fist-praying gesture to the forehead. This was their way of worshipping the golden mask, not the wearer.After the recital, the tall, thin man solemnly puts the mask on as expected. Of which, Duncan immediately noticed the change in the air and the person\u2019s temperament\u2026.Something\u2019s coming!He couldn\u2019t say what this feeling was as if another character had descended upon the mask and its wearer. Regardless, a powerful consciousness was projecting its power through the golden mask, similar to what Duncan was doing with this specific shell.\u201cMay the glory of the Lord endure forever! May the ways of the Lord come to the world!\u201d The surrounding believers exclaimed in unison over the new arrival.This strange heavy atmosphere wasn\u2019t that new to Duncan. He had seen the priest wear this mask in the sewer before, but unlike this time, that shell he used was dead and already deceased. On top of that, he had missed the summoning ritual, which might explain why he didn\u2019t get the same pressure as now. Perhaps there\u2019s a reason for calling these priests the \u201cEmissary\u201d instead of mere formality and rank.Maybe a communication device?After connecting the dots on this interesting item, Duncan\u2019s eyes changed from curiosity to a glowing desire to own it.Maybe that mask and I are fated\u2026.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 73": "Chapter 73 \u201cIncomplete Memory\u201dThis Translation is hosted on https://bcatranslation.com/Duncan quickly withdrew his gaze from the golden mask to blend in like an ordinary believer once things started rolling. This was so he wouldn\u2019t attract further attention since he hadn\u2019t heard anything useful yet.Then, when he lowered his head to act inconspicuously, Duncan suddenly got that strange sensation of being stared at again.The man frowned slightly in annoyance. Then searching around, he again found the source, and like before, it was the child wearing that strange bell collar around the neck, averting eye contact when he looked over.Now, this got the guy wondering.He\u2019s sure they didn\u2019t know each other. In the memory of the original owner of this body, there was no information regarding this child.Why is a follower of the sun god looking my way so frequently?Is it because of Ai on my shoulder? She\u2019s that much of a chic attraction?He thought about this possibility, but then the cult leader interrupted that train of thought by speaking in a somewhat echoing and divine voice that demanded attention. Talk about a transformation.\u201cThe prayer is over. The Lord has witnessed our piety and awe. Grace has shone on our souls, so my brothers and sisters, be gratified that we have persevered for one more day in this difficult and dark world. We\u2019re one day closer to seeing the day when our sun is reborn and recasted upon this world!\u201dThe \u201cpriest\u201d wearing the golden mask then spreads his hands and casts his gaze at the corner where a certain person stands.\u201cBut before proceeding with today\u2019s gathering, I would like to welcome two of our compatriots who were once trapped by darkness in these difficult times. Thanks to the guidance of our Lord, they\u2019ve been reunited with us\u2026 Go ahead my fellow faithful, introduce yourself.\u201dTwo compatriots?Duncan suddenly remembered that the leader mentioned he was not the only new face around these halls. For some reason, the ghost captain\u2019s attention shifted to the little girl wearing that black frilly dress.\u201cYou can call me Shirley.\u201d The girl took half a step forward and spoke frankly, \u201cMy parents are both followers of our faith. Unfortunately, they were killed by the minions of the Storm Church four years ago. I have been hiding around the Crossroad all these years without managing to make contact with our siblings\u2026. It\u2019s great that you\u2019re all here now.\u201dHer voice was not loud to the point of being quiet and well-behaved. In fact, Duncan could never match the girl with the picture of a bloodied cultist willing to sacrifice innocent lives.\u201cWelcome back among us, young sister.\u201d The leader nodded, then turned to face the surrounding worshippers, \u201cShirley\u2019s parents were killed by the purge four years ago, and we have found her parents\u2019 names on that year\u2019s list. Next is another compatriot that joined us today.\u201dThe ringleader\u2019s gaze finally fell on Duncan.\u201cDuncan, I live in the Lower Sector,\u201d he had already prepared for this, so he wasted no time in the introduction. \u201cA few days ago, the Storm Church attacked a sacrificial ground me and my local siblings created. I am the only survivor left.\u201dHe said this briefly but sincerely, like someone that didn\u2019t want to recall a terrible memory. Since the news of the Storm Church\u2019s raid had made the news, the cultists had no reason to doubt his story.Seemingly pleased by the smooth introduction, the ringleader began again by nodding and adding: \u201cThis is a tested compatriot. After experiencing the cruelty of those hounds from the Storm Church, he is still trying his best to return to the Lord\u2019s embrace. We also found the blessed keepsake of our faith on him, so his words are credible.\u201dSome of the cultists sighed over the tragic story, and some nodded in approval. Duncan on the other hand, only wanted to get things moving by putting on a blank face and reciting the multiplication table backward.\u201cThe brief introduction is over,\u201d the leader finally got onto something interesting, \u201cand now to update you all on the situation.\u201dDuncan\u2019s ears immediately perked up.\u201c\u2026\u2026 At present, there are still a large number of compatriots gathering in this city. This includes ordinary faithful like us and powerful emissaries and priests overseeing the whole mission. Fret not, our powers are gradually growing, and the day of re-order is fast approaching\u2026\u201d\u201cBut it is undeniable that the minions of the Storm Church have caught onto our presence. They and the crooks inside city hall are making entry stricter and investigating foreigners entering Pland. At this point, several of our siblings have already been captured by the police. Be warned. We must succeed in our objective. Do not let your guard down, be wary, be on watch, and look out for the hounds from the church. It is fine to slow down the progress in collecting the sacrifices. The heirs of the Lord know about our plight, and they have issued a decree that they will personally take care of the remaining half of the sacrifice pool if we can\u2019t solve it\u2026.\u201dThe surrounding cultists all reacted like they\u2019d been greatly moved by the news and started praising the sun god. Duncan, on the other hand, wasn\u2019t so pleased. He didn\u2019t forget the mass carnage in that sewer, and it seems that the mastermind \u2013 whatever Sun Heirs or Sun Children \u2013 will personally take charge and participate?\u201c\u2026 At present, our main task is to determine the specific location of the sun fragment. Remember, our goal is always to bring the real sun god back to life, and finding the lost sun fragments is the most important part!\u201dDuncan\u2019s heart shudderedSun fragments? What is that stuff?Can a stack of sun fragments make the Spear of Arden bigger?The bird on his shoulder suddenly grew agitated, which manifested in Ai issuing a low cooing sound from the throat and bobbing her head up and down.Duncan naturally could tell what the bird wanted through the ghost fire connection. However, there\u2019s no way Duncan would allow Ai to start crying out something like \u201cslaughter the enemy with the solar tomahawk\u201d in the middle of a cultist gathering.\u201cShhh,\u201d he hushes the bird in a mumble. Then caressing Ai\u2019s head to soothe the girl, the guy knew this was asking a lot from a yappy mouth.\u201cAre we able to determine the approximate location of the sun fragment? Is there a way to detect it?\u201d Then another cultist spoke up to ask the question they all wanted to know.\u201cThe sun fragment is currently asleep and cannot be detected by any means.\u201d The leader shook his head in disappointment, \u201cBut the Lord has sent down guidance, telling us the nearest fragment is currently hiding in Pland. Out of consideration for our new compatriots that have joined today, I will explain the full situation again.\u201d\u201cAccording to the information available, the fragment should have first appeared eleven years ago and has likely caused some kind of large-scale vision in the city. It could be a large fire, an abnormal heatwave in the entire neighborhood, or the spontaneous combustion of the collective human body. Whatever the scenario, we must investigate the matter now.\u201d\u201cThe city-state authorities have detailed information about the phenomena of transcendence events over the years. Our job now is to gather these clues to deduce where our next lead lies.\u201d\u201cBut beware, all inquiry must be done with caution and planning. Although the authorities have always been lax in the management of the lower city, the hounds of the Storm Church sometimes have a particularly sensitive sense of smell when it comes to us\u2026 They are already on their toes.\u201dWhile the leader explained the current situation to the surrounding congregation, Duncan\u2019s mind was spinning rapidly, and paying special attention to the part about \u201celeven years ago\u201d. It\u2019s not because the sun fragment made an appearance that year, but because that\u2019s the year Nina lost her parents\u2026.From what he recalled, Nina\u2019s parents died in a fire.Is it just a coincidence? Is there such a coincidence?Duncan tried to sort out the messy and broken memories in his mind to little avail. Nevertheless, there were two crucial images he picked out from the chaotic picture: the original body owner ran out of the fire while carrying his dying niece. Behind them were the burning embers of an indistinguishable building, and the phantom-like streets were packed with crowds of frenzied civilians running for their lives\u2026.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 74": "Chapter 74 \u201cThere\u2019s A Spy!\u201dThis Translation is hosted on https://bcatranslation.com/In the end, Duncan couldn\u2019t dig up any more memories from his mind.Although Ron \u2013 the original owner of the body \u2013 had indeed worried about Nina, years of illness and abuse of alcohol and drugs had seriously damaged his cognitive ability. Therefore, when the guy breathed his last breath, many of those not rarely-seen warm memories were gone, lost forever with the passing of the soul.Nevertheless, one thing\u2019s certain, there was a fire eleven years ago in the lower sector of the city. It took Nina\u2019s parents and changed the child\u2019s life forever.This may be a coincidence, but how many coincidences exist in this world? The sun fragment descended on the city-state of Pland. It caused the raging fire that burned a huge area of the city and killed many innocent people as collateral damage, thus causing a certain child to be orphaned as a result. Then a few years later, Ron, the uncle of said niece, became a degenerate due to illness and became the very suntists that likely summoned the sun fragment\u2026When there are too many coincidences, then it\u2019s no coincidence. Perhaps a hand was twisting the knobs and pulling the strings behind these fateful events.During his long contemplation, a loud and clear voice suddenly interrupted Duncan: \u201cI have inquired about the matter from the locals in the past few days. According to their knowledge, there was no famous fire eleven years ago\u2026. However, some of them did mention a factory leak of poisonous gas from the storage tank. The gas spread across several blocks and caused a lot of people to hallucinate and go crazy. The event was also published in the weekly newspaper back then as well.\u201dDuncan looked up in surprise and saw that it was an ordinary-looking female who spoke.However, before he could seriously consider what the other party had said, the cult leader\u2019s gaze had already turned to him: \u201cCompatriot, you happen to be a local here. Do you know the situation in this regard?\u201dDuncan was startled and suddenly realized that he had become the focus of the scene \u2013 for this group of outsiders who were trying to gather intelligence, their own local who \u201clived in the lower city of Pland\u201d was undoubtedly a good source of intelligence!Noticing a few sights coming from the surroundings, he thought about it for a moment: \u201cI didn\u2019t live here eleven years ago, so the specifics are not clear. However, the leakage of the factory has indeed been mentioned\u2026\u201dWhile elaborating, he looked at the female believer who had just spoken: \u201cEleven years ago, there really wasn\u2019t any fire in the lower city?\u201d\u201cAt least as far as I\u2019ve gathered,\u201d the cultist nodded. \u201cAccording to what I\u2019ve heard, there hasn\u2019t been a major fire in the lower sector of Pland in the past twenty years\u2026 There were small fires such as kitchen mishaps, but that is obviously not considered in the scope of our search.\u201dDuncan blinked and said nothing.He clearly remembered that Nina\u2019s parents had died in the fire eleven years ago! The memory fragments in his mind even have the image of \u201chimself\u201d rushing out of the fire with Nina!What went wrong? Is it because this body went deranged when I inherited it? Or is it because there\u2019s no fire in the lower sector of the city? Or\u2026. it\u2019s just that this cultist in front of me didn\u2019t get the right information yet\u2026A faint doubt grew in his heart because the matter involved Nina and \u201chimself\u201d. Then as he was processing what to do, a faint voice came again from that Shirley child: \u201cThe factory leak from eleven years ago\u2026 Did it happen in the sixth block?\u201d\u201cSixth block? Mmm\u2026\u2026 I believe so,\u201d the female believer nodded. \u201cIt is said that the incident caused quite a big stir back then because many people were left with health conditions. As a result, many lower city residents still remember it to this day.\u201dA few believers next to him nodded and echoed what they heard, which reinforced the story since that\u2019s what they uncovered as well.\u201cThe factory leaked\u2026\u201d the leader in the center of the assembly hall suddenly broke the silence, and the deep and majestic voice resulting from the mask echoed following his words. \u201cThe chemical leak could just be a cover-up by the authorities. The fact that it happened eleven years ago is too big of a coincidence. We will continue investigating this direction and see if the story points to the sun fragment.\u201dThe worshippers at the scene immediately nodded in support.\u201cAlthough the sun fragment is slumbering, its awakening day is fast approaching. Four years ago, our brethren\u2019s in Pland attempted to awaken the fragment with a rite, but they were foiled by the interference of the Storm Church. But fret not. The efforts were not in vain. On the contrary, the blood spilled that day only deepened the sun\u2019s connection with our world. So now, we must pay close attention to the news and rumors on the streets. If anything unusual happens, it may also point to the sun fragment. Do you all understand?!\u201dWhile the worshippers bowed their heads and respectfully accepted the order, Duncan, on the other hand, noticed another key point mentioned by the leader: Four years ago!Duncan only knew the Storm Church destroyed a major stronghold of the sun cultists, but he never knew it was related to the sun fragment!As the ghost captain organized the new information he had just gained, a strange pungent smell suddenly penetrated his nostrils and drew the man back to reality \u2013 it smelled like burning sulfur that\u2019s been mixed with various chemicals.The next second, the surrounding cultists also smelled this pungent and unmistakable scent, causing most of them to scan around for the source. However, the masked leader standing at the hall\u2019s center instantly reacted. He pulled out the same type of sun talisman from his pocket and raised it high to unleash a globe of translucent flame!\u201cVile filth\u2026 The flames have been deceived!\u201d The leader glanced at the burning sun talisman and voiced his anger, \u201cThere is a heretic lurking among us!\u201dThe hall instantly flew into an uproar, and Duncan\u2019s first reaction was that he had been exposed. Although he didn\u2019t know how he got exposed, but the sun talisman carried by the leader seem to be able to identify the spy in their mix.Thinking of this, he sighed faintly and was ready to release the dove\u2019s undead form when he heard another sigh from the opposite side.It was the girl called Shirly who sounded regretful: \u201cI knew that Dog\u2019s spell is unreliable. The disguise only lasted for three hours.\u201dBefore the words fell, a pitch-black flame suddenly exploded around the girl\u2019s side!The flame was born out of thin air, with the shape of fire but dark as a shadow. It first spread from one of the arms to the shoulder until it covered one-third of Shirley\u2019s entire figure. Eventually, the eerie black flame condensed on the ground like an oozing fluid and reformed into a pitch-black demon dog physically connected to the girl through a chain!The undead hound was over half a person tall, and its body appeared to be spliced together from countless twisted bones of other animals. Of course, there was no flesh, but it had wriggling black flames wrapped around the bones like skin. However, the most eye-catching part wasn\u2019t its main body, but the head! Those bloodied red eyes were so full of malice and hunger that it looked like it would devour its prey merely by visual contact!\u201cDark Hound\u2026 A summoner of the Annihilation Sect?!\u201d The leader in the center of the assembly hall was furious when he saw this scene, \u201cWhat is the meaning of this?! Are the worshippers of death declaring war against the sun\u2019s follower?!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 75": "Chapter 75 \u201cA Beatdown!\u201dThis Translation is hosted on https://bcatranslation.com/Looking at the way things are panning out, Duncan, who was ready to generously announce he was the spy, immediately retreated. Like the rest of the people here, he\u2019s also curious about what the girl has in store.Intuition told him the girl in the black dress must have a plan; otherwise, she wouldn\u2019t be so bold to expose herself.Also, Duncan didn\u2019t miss the two names mentioned by the cult leader: Dark Hound, and Annihilation Sect.The Dark Hound was obviously referring to the giant black skeleton dog summoned by the girl. The Annihilation Sect needed no further elaboration that it\u2019s an organization too dangerous to be registered at the city hall.How many more strange dark sects are still nested in the gutters of this world?While Duncan\u2019s thoughts were spinning, the girl who summoned the dark hound had begun to fight by tightening her grip around the chains. She\u2019s guarded in her posture, and that sarcastic smirk indicated the girl\u2019s not fretting in the slightest: \u201cAnnihilation Sect\u2026 too bad for you, but I\u2019m not with them. Unlike you mongrels who must work for some evil god to sleep peacefully, I only do things for myself!\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t deceive us with that statement. Only the Annihilation Sect knows how to summon the deep sea creatures! I advise you to stop resisting, heretic! This is the territory of the Sun! Even the curses of your dark hound cannot protect you!\u201d The leader in the center of the assembly hall glared at Shirley and threatened, \u201cSpeak, what are you planning?! Annihilation and Sun are not aligned, but we have never been hostile. Why do you disguise your identity and blend into our sacred assembly?\u201d\u201cI just wanted to get some information out of the not-so-bright heads of you mongrels.\u201d Shirley grinned mischievously as a series of rattling sounds came from the chains connected to her body. Those chains were clearly alive in the way they squirmed with her chuckle. \u201cAlso, I said it already, I am not from the Annihilation~!\u201dBut before Shirley could finish speaking, a series of crackling sounds had popped around the hall, setting the oil lamps into a burning frenzy. Before she knew it, small fireballs had risen from the torches and floated into the air, circling around and forming an entrapment around herself as the target.It\u2019s pretty obvious the experienced cult priest had used the delay he made to unleash this spell.\u201cSurrender yourself, heretic,\u201d came the threatening voice under the golden mask, \u201cthe power of the sun god has sealed off the entire assembly ground from the outside. I know the abilities of you heretics from the Annihilation Sect. You borrow powers from the mouth of those demons you summon. I admit the Dark Hound under you is terrifying, but it\u2019s of no consequence if you can\u2019t borrow power from the deep sea!\u201dDuncan wondered if he should intervene and help the girl called Shirley. It\u2019s nice to see two dark forces bite each other, but if he did ignore this, he would be letting the information go from this windfall.\u201cGive up resistance and take refuge in the realm of the sun god. Tell me everything you know, and the merciful Sun will forgive your sins\u2026 Get on your knees, young sister\u2026 You can\u2019t cast your spells here\u2026\u201dHowever, in the face of the death threat, Shirley remained unfazed, like someone that\u2019s deaf to the hypnotic voice of the golden mask. \u201cMaintaining this forcefield must take a lot out of you, right?\u201dThe sun priest snorted coldly: \u201cHmph, the power my lord gave\u2026\u201dBefore his voice fell, the girl in the black dress jumped without indication!Raising her right arm that\u2019s embroiled in black fire, Shirley whisks herself into a spin for momentum as the Dark Hound on the ground becomes a weaponized spinning hammer of bones. The hound sent numerous cultists flying from the initial charge, but most of all, the hound sent the priest smashing into the opposite wall with a deafening crunch upon impact.It\u2019s obvious something had snapped inside the cult leader because that body instantly went limp. In fact, there weren\u2019t life signs left in the mask wearer.Duncan: \u201c\u2026\u201dHe really didn\u2019t expect this.Talk about fast. Without waiting for the other cultists to react to their leader\u2019s death, Shirley raised her arm again with that iron chain of bone hammer and spun it into a terrifying arc. After several louder crushing snaps and knocks, the entire hall had become a splat of mangled flesh and blood.This time, the surviving cultists finally came back to their senses. Regardless of the shock in their hearts, everyone roared and rushed at the perpetrator. They threw daggers and swords through the air, and in response, Shirley unleashed a series of curse words and more attacks: \u201cGO TMD your lord! You damn bastards!\u201dThe giant hound broke through the air, this time not even letting the victims fly out and ripped them to shreds with his jaw and claws. Round and round Dog went, and death and screams continued until several thumping gunshots rocked the room\u2026.The Sunists, with revolvers, finally found the gap they needed after so many of their comrades died. They were the cautious bunch and brightest since they kept their distance right from the beginning.Brass bullets pierced the air there. Two landed on the metal chain and ricocheted off with sparks. The rest burrowed into Shirley\u2019s flesh, causing the girl to wince at the pain.\u201cUhhh\u2026\u201d Stumbling unsteadily for a while, she appeared weakened and ready to drop when the sound of iron whistled through the air again. \u201cDog! Help me block out the pain!\u201dThe Dark Hound, slashing at the cultists on his own now, lets out a deafening roar. The next second, one of those gun-shooting cultists was directly blasted off from the shockwave and made a head-first impact to the nearest pillar, effectively becoming a mini version of Alice.Duncan silently took two steps back as the undead hound continued his rampage. He didn\u2019t want to interfere yet and lowered his presence \u2013 one for information, the other was that he didn\u2019t want to get blood splattered on his new outfit. If he went home today and Nina saw the mess, he would never hear the end of it.As for the one individual utilizing the meteor dog weapon, Duncan doubted the lady needed his help now\u2026She\u2019s in good shape.In fact, the whole battle lasted no more than a minute, just enough time for Duncan to recite the multiplication table twice. Then just as the girl clutched the chain connecting her with that hound called Dog, she froze and caught a glimpse of Duncan hiding in the corner.Despite being stunned and confused by the calm appearance of this eccentric \u201ccultist\u201d, Shirley did not hesitate and flung Dog at the final target with unabashed hostility.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 76": "Chapter 76 \u201cDoggies Heart Reading!\u201dThis Translation is hosted on https://bcatranslation.com/Seeing Shirley murderously marching towards him, Duncan couldn\u2019t help but sigh and bemoan how trouble always lands on top of his head.He wasn\u2019t afraid to be fair. The guy understood his own combat experience, which was next to zero, but the tough childlike girl didn\u2019t strike him with panic at all.First of all, he has his personal undead dove who\u2019s plenty good at delaying death \u2013 the sphere of influence Ai projected could grow faster than any gun bullet. Therefore, if Shirley did toss the Dark Hound known as Dog over, he\u2019s sure Ai would intercept the projectile mid-air.Secondly, he controls the ghost fire that wields powers capable of controlling even the Vanished. An undead skeleton hound could hardly compare, right? If anything, Duncan could always envelope himself in the fire and transform.Finally, and most importantly \u2013 this avatar wasn\u2019t his main body anyway.Although from a physiological point of view, this avatar seems to be alive, but in essence \u201cit\u201d was still just a corpse driven by ghostly forces. Duncan does not need this body to remain physiologically intact to drive its activities, just like the previous \u201cavatar\u201d in the sewer that had already died by having its heart ripped out.In fact, he suspects that even if the current avatar get\u2019s chopped up into eight pieces, he could still control the fleshly blocks and go home\u2026.The only thing to worry about was how he would explain that to Nina about her uncle\u2019s skeletal miracles after being smashed by a meteor hound\u2026Just like that, he calmly watched the black-dress girl come up to him while carrying the iron chain in her hands. Meanwhile, the strange and terrifying Dark Hound slowly followed behind its mistress\u2019s elusive steps.Because of the previous fierce battle, the girl\u2019s arms and cheeks were stained with blood, which completely destroyed the quiet and well-behaved temperament she gave people at the beginning. Instead, she\u2019s now projecting an eerie and dangerous vibe.\u201cYou\u2019re not afraid, how weird,\u201d Shirley stopped about three meters in front of Duncan, frowning at the \u201cSun Cultist\u201d who didn\u2019t appear scared or nervous. Raising her chain quietly in a near-threatening manner: \u201cYou giving up?\u201dDuncan thought for a moment before replying, \u201cIf I say I\u2019m not with them, will you believe me?\u201dAs he spoke, he silently rubbed his fingers together in his pocket and summoned up a spark of green flame that flowed between his clothes and skin. This would act as a suit of armor in case the girl jumped at him without talking first.Shirley naturally didn\u2019t buy the answer and showed a WTF are you kidding me face. \u201cYou think\u2026\u201dBefore she could speak, Dog the Dark Hound next to her cut the girl off and said in a deep, hoarse voice: \u201cI believe it.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Huuhh?\u201d Shirley looked at her familiar dumbfoundedly, \u201cDog, did you hit your head? This\u2026.\u201d\u201cHold on,\u201d Dog shook his skeletal head before staggering over to one corner and started vomiting.The extraordinarily loud sound of puking slurry echoed in the blood-stained basement, and the terrifying demon from the deep sea unleashed what could only be described as a mixture of pungent black flames and acid that hissed upon contact with the concrete flooring.Duncan watched this scene unfold with an expressionless face while wondering if he had just found the shortcoming to this \u201cShirkey\u2019s\u201d combat style \u2013 the human could withstand the fight, but the dog couldn\u2019t take it from being flung around so much.So, the atmosphere became quite awkward and embarrassing for the next three minutes. Only after Dog stopped puking did Duncan speak up again: \u201cAre you okay?\u201dDog immediately lowered his head and coiled that bony tail behind his hind legs: \u201cThank you for your concern, I hope my embarrassing display didn\u2019t stain your eyes. Do you have any other order? If not, we\u2019ll leave first\u2026\u201dBefore Duncan could respond to what Dog said, Shirley exclaimed first: \u201cDog, are you really okay? Did I really break your head just now?! You don\u2019t usually talk to humans so politely\u2026.\u201dDuncan had begun to catch onto the truth. Deepening his gaze at the murderous-looking Dark Hound, he mused with amusement on what to do next. \u201cDo you know why I am? Do you know me?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Dog repeated without daring to make eye contact, \u201cI really don\u2019t know\u2026 But you\u2019re definitely a great being, there\u2019s no doubt about that\u2026\u201dDuncan frowned and pressed, \u201cI don\u2019t look like a human in your eyes, do I?\u201dDog hesitation flared up again before cautiously answering, \u201cYou\u2026 like\u2026 not\u2026\u201dDuncan withdrew his gaze and turned to Shirley this time.The girl in the black dress was making a disbelieving face. Whatever hostility she had for Duncan had dissipated, replaced by a thick layer of shock and wariness.This girl\u2019s personality appeared reckless but obviously not stupid. After her \u201cpet dog\u201d continuously shows such abnormal behavior, even the most reckless personality would calm down at this time and realize something was terribly wrong.While quietly tightening the chains between her and the Dark Hound, she quietly took half a step back and stared at Duncan for any signs of sudden movement: \u201cYou just said you are not with them\u2026\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Duncan spread his hands, \u201cyou may not believe me, but also mixed in to inquire about intelligence\u2026\u201d\u201cI believe it,\u201d Shirley said crisply.This time it was Duncan\u2019s turn to be a little taken aback. He suddenly found the impression he had of this girl to be changing. At first, her image was that of a well-behaved child with a violent and bloodied side. Now, he\u2019s also mistaken about Shirley\u2019s reckless tendency.What kind of family does this girl have to produce such a personality?With strange questions running through his heart, Duncan found himself a little overwhelmed by the contradictions. Eventually, he put it behind him and pressed forward: \u201cWhy did you keep looking at me during the rally?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Dog who kept paying attention to you,\u201d Shirley replied reluctantly but still honestly cooperated, \u201cI followed his lead and grew curious\u2026\u201d\u201cDog? You mean your Dark Hound?\u201d Duncan frowned and glanced at the pitch-black bony hound, \u201cI just heard that priest mention the Annihilation Sect. Is it the church you worship? Are you part of the Annihilation Sect?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not with them!\u201d Shirley immediately rebukes the notion with strong emotions, \u201cIt\u2019s their business to worship the Deep Sea. Me and Dog met under certain circumstances!\u201dDuncan\u2019s gaze now fell on the chain between the girl\u2019s arm and the Dark Hound.According to the information obtained, worshipping the Deep Sea allows a follower to summon up a demonic creature from the nether. This was the main reason that Sun Priest assumed Shirley came from the Annihilation Sect. Although the consequence of that judgment was the unorthodox attack of a meteor dog hammer, this information should be acceptable and correct.The only wrong thing about all this would be this problematic and eccentric girl in front of him.She seems to be very resistant to being associated with cultists\u2014even though she owns a Dark Hound from the Deep Sea.\u201cIt\u2019s okay if you\u2019re not,\u201d Duncan shook his head and waved to drop the question, \u201cthen why are you here, and what are you investigating?\u201dShirley pursed her lips, seemingly not wanting to answer the question. However, the nervous signals constantly released by the hound beside herself made the child understand she must. Otherwise, the consequences of lying or staying mute in front of this ordinary-looking middle-aged man would be dire.\u201cI\u2026\u201dAt the moment when she was about to speak, a loud popping sound suddenly exploded in the basement, and a fiery fireball flew over from the side!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 77": "Chapter 77 \u201cThoughts On The Fire\u201dThis Translation is hosted on https://bcatranslation.com/A pop exploded in the basement, followed by a blazing fireball suddenly flying over from the side. The sneak attack would\u2019ve been fatal if not for Duncan being aware of this ahead of time \u2013 he had already raised his hand without thinking.A little burning sensation came from the fingertips. Then, in the next second, the ghost fire that spewed out flew into the fireball with a recoiling and deflagrating momentum. Once infected, the attack was no longer threatening but had transformed into a ball of pulsating green.This opening didn\u2019t escape a certain Dark Hound there. Immediately without hesitation, Dog jumped backward and ripped open a grizzly crack of darkness and fog in the rear. Using this escape tunnel, he directly jumped in and dragged Shirley in using the black chain\u2019s momentum. Meanwhile, the girl herself hadn\u2019t forgotten to spit out the bullets she ate from the fighting. And just like that, the child and her dog had disappeared from the room and into the weird rift were now closed.Duncan was naturally taken by surprise at how quickly the pair made their escape. It\u2019s definitely practiced and well-performed. He had to give them that.I still have a lot of questions that I haven\u2019t asked yet! And this is all because of a sneak attack from a cultist\u2026.Duncan\u2019s mood fell into a subtle gloom as he shifted his gaze in the assailant\u2019s direction. The masked priest was leaning crookedly against the corner pillar, barely breathing with a raised arm in the air. Apparently, that was the last draw of power from that vessel.\u201cI better get into the habit of finishing off my foes. It won\u2019t do if stuff like this happens during my fights\u2026.\u201dDuncan gloomily approached the priest, who didn\u2019t die properly with the green fireball silently floating above his palm. With every step he took, the torches closest to him would flare up into a pyre of ghostly green, the sign that they\u2019d been overtaken by the power emanating from the ghost captain.For this, a glint of fear finally struck the priest\u2019s eyes. Like everything else in the basement hall, his own connection to that black sun had begun to wane.\u201cYou\u2026 You are no ordinary heretic. What the hell are you\u2026\u201d The masked priest asks with shock and fear.Following the last usurpation of the torches, the ghost captain stopped only a foot away from the survivor and stared down: \u201cI didn\u2019t get to finish when you interrupted me. That is very rude of you. Did your mother not teach you manners?\u201dAs he spoke, the ghost captain finally noticed the state of the sun priest and how wrong he was to blame Shirley for not doing a proper job. Half of the guy\u2019s chest had caved in, with various rib cages smashed and likely pierced a lung or two.Without question, if left untreated, the individual would die in no time and doesn\u2019t need an extra stab to kill.Why the priest didn\u2019t die yet was likely the effect of whatever mystique entity hiding behind him. But even so, that power holding the person above the death line had reached its limit. Duncan could clearly see the life force rapidly leaving the priest\u2019s body as they spoke.\u201cIt seems that the blessings of the sun god are not very reliable,\u201d Duncan shook his head and sighed with a lamenting face, \u201cYour Lord has left you.\u201dThe ghost captain may have sighed casually like he was merely stating the facts. Still, the careless remark had the unintended effect of stimulating the dying priest into a frenzied rage.\u201cI offer myself to the Lord! May the holy cloth purify the heresy before you!\u201d The priest shouted and raised a filthy blood-stained fabric he pulled from the pocket. This was the guy\u2019s last-ditch effort to drag Duncan down with him, a double suicide of only the most insane and corrupt.Duncan, however, only watched this final crazed act with indifference. Although the priest did startle him with that sudden gesture, but after getting a closer look at the item, his whole body instantly relaxed.Why? Because the strange cloth strip that got raised high was none other than the very thing they used to verify Duncan\u2019s identity after coming inside. Whatever sacred power the cloth had belonged to the ghost captain now.Just as predicted, the holy relic remained quiet and unresponsive, causing the cult priest\u2019s maddening face to slowly crumble.After a few more seconds of dazedness in those eyes, the dying man abruptly flew into an incessant coughing fit of blood, \u201cI offer this body to the Lord\u2026.\u201d\u201cLet me guess, this is what you wanted to do, right?\u201d Duncan couldn\u2019t stand this sight anymore and pointed at the blood-stained fabric.In the next second, a cluster of dark green flames exploded and ignited the holy relic and spread across the crazed man\u2019s body.\u201cNo, no, no\u2026 It shouldn\u2019t be like this\u2026 The Lord will not turn his back on me, the Lord\u2026 the Lord will punish you hereti\u2026 WHO ARE YOU?!\u201dIn the raging fire, the voice of the cult priest gradually died down until its completely mute. Whatever supernatural power that supported the guy\u2019s life was now extinguished, as well as the body that burned to ash in the raging green pyre.This brought another unexpected frown to Duncan.Honestly, this was not the first time the ghost captain had seen a corpse. The sacrifices he found in the underground cave before had already hardened his nerves. What he didn\u2019t like about this was that his flames also burned the cultist to ash. He only wanted to destroy the blood-stained cloth out of prudence of caution, so he made sure to not overdo it. The surviving clothes and golden mask were evident he didn\u2019t misjudge his own strength.This\u2026. why did this cultist get burned by my ghost fire too when I didn\u2019t order it to?Duncan crouched down and examined the residue in confusion.According to what he could see, the greyish pile of soot looked no different from the usual stuff. At least not distinct enough where he could see a difference.Slowly, a bold idea popped into the ghost captain\u2019s mind.Can it be\u2026. Mortals blessed by a specific god will also be considered a supernatural object?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 78": "Chapter 78 \u201cChanging Shifts and Reporting\u201dThis Translation is hosted on https://bcatranslation.com/Duncan\u2019s pondering was naturally fruitless because he didn\u2019t know where to find a second breathing Sunist to test his deductions.This kind of thing depends on fate and plenty of luck.Pulling himself up, Duncan scanned the room and paced in a circle, causing the green torches to sway at his every step.Believers who believe in their gods and receive a blessing may be seen by the ghost fire as a \u201csupernatural object\u201d, then\u2026 what about ordinary people?Does it have other effects than lighting up a room when lit on a mortal? If not, how much blessing must a god give the mortal before they are spiritually changed? Will it also work on the good god disciples?Duncan calmly glanced at the ghost lights in the room and formed a faint and eerie smile.\u201cBut they are still people\u2026.\u201d Stopping here before his theories got out of hand, Duncan didn\u2019t want to cross a line of no return in his worldview.This flame was a powerful force that could warp even the most dangerous of entities in this world. If he didn\u2019t keep reminding himself of this fact, he might actually lose awareness that he too was human and shouldn\u2019t think any less of his fellow man. Otherwise, what difference would he have from those monsters that treat others as mere sacrifices? That\u2019s a bridge of depravity he doesn\u2019t want to cross.Exhaling softly to get his mind back in order, Duncan waved his hand to dismiss the green fireball that was floating in the air. Afterward, the environment in the basement quickly returned to normal as well, giving the guy a proper picture of the carnage that just took place in the hall.More importantly, it also gave him room to think of what to do next.The eccentric girl named Shirley was gone after using some special means of escape, and now he doesn\u2019t know where to look. A regrettable outcome since he still had a lot of questions he wanted to ask.But no manner, instincts told Duncan they would eventually meet again. He was in search of information, and Shirley was also in search of information. Since their goals aligned, there\u2019s no way they wouldn\u2019t bump into each other. Besides, that Dark Hound called Dog didn\u2019t seem to be the type of character to stay quiet.As for the mess here, Duncan had no interest in helping with the cleanup duty.He picked up the golden mask and casually cleaned the soot off with his sleeve. This would make a fine trophy aboard the Vanished for further investigation.\u201cBut it\u2019s a little bit too big to carry around\u2026.\u201d Duncan muttered, then weighed his options, \u201cIn any case, an expert would probably recognize the item immediately. It may even draw the Storm Church\u2019s attention knowing they have some weird detection means.\u201dI better not bring this back to the antique shop then. Even if I hide it, Nina might find it during her cleaning. By then, I won\u2019t be able to explain the mask\u2019s origin. Best to send it to the Vanished right away.With that thought in mind, Duncan shifted his gaze over to Ai, who had been resting on his shoulder, and cocked his head to signal her to move it.Reading his thought, the dove promptly chirped a counteroffer: \u201cBig hammer is eighty, small hammer is forty!\u201dThat irked Duncan a bit since he never thought about bargaining with his own pet: \u201cJust work the overtime. When we get back, I\u2019ll figure out a way to make you some French fries aboard the Vanished. I want to see if you can bring the mask back on your own without my company.\u201dThe dove immediately flapped her wings and drew a circle in the air like some overjoyed pixie. \u201cI wanted to refuse, but the offer you gave is too tempting!\u201dThen before the sentence was done, Ai had already transformed into her undead form and carried off the mask into the void. Duncan was still connected with the bird, of course. Right now, Ai\u2019s energy signature had appeared inside the captain\u2019s bedroom aboard the Vanished.Damn, the delay is less than a second! SHE\u2019S FAST! TELEPORTATION?Duncan just sighed in his heart at how capable the bird was. Then before the ghost captain could think more, the boney undead bird had returned following a whisk of distorting air.\u201cTeleportation success!\u201d The bird flapped her wings and chirped triumphantly.In the following minutes, Duncan confirmed no blood had caught onto his clothes or the crime scene. He had never touched anything since entering for fear of leaving a fingerprint, so the extra precaution wasn\u2019t necessary. Then carefully prying open the iron door with his clothes as a cushion, he returned to the outside following the stairs.By this hour, the sun, bound by the double rune ring, had gradually begun to set on the horizon, soon to be replaced by the giant crack in the night sky. This signaled Duncan to call it for the day. Nina would return home soon, and it wouldn\u2019t be good to snoop around at night and act all suspicious.Besides, the kid\u2019s \u201cUncle Duncan\u201d had just gotten better, so he needed to act the role of a good uncle did he not?Quickly leaving the abandoned factory behind and taking the same route, the man soon found himself walking through sewage-smelling alleys until he heard the faint sound of traffic. He could still catch the last bus down to the lower sector if he hurried.But Duncan stopped.At the intersection not far ahead, he saw four men in uniform standing there. The first two wore dark blue police uniforms with epaulets on their shoulders. In contrast, the last other two wore slightly ecclesiastical black outfits in the shape of trench coats. However, the latter had another conspicuous thing hanging around their waists: a lantern decorated with runes, apparently used for night patrols.This left Duncan stunned for a moment until he understood they were changing shifts for the night and not out to get him.The police maintain order during the day, and the guardians protect the peace at night. This was a unique scenery to this world during the interchanging of day and night.Knowing he hadn\u2019t been caught, Duncan casually marched over like a regular person. The less weird you behave, the less likely you would be suspected.Eventually, a church guardian carrying out the handover finally noticed the figure coming toward them. Then raising a hand out in a stopping motion: \u201cCitizen! It\u2019s getting dark. Go home as soon as possible. It\u2019s not safe outside.\u201d\u201cGentlemen! I\u2019m here to make a report,\u201d Duncan said sincerely as he walked over, quickening his pace during the last bit. \u201cI heard a lot of movement in the abandoned factory over there. There were a lot of sneaky guys coming in and out of there earlier\u2026\u201dSpeaking of this, he paused and added: \u201cI read in the newspaper before, saying that everyone should actively report suspicious gatherings and abnormal noises around them\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 79": "Chapter 79 \u201cFlickering Light\u201dThis Translation is hosted on https://bcatranslation.com/Deep within a vulgar old alley far from the abandoned factory, an inconspicuous rundown house suddenly lit up after the oil lamps came to life.Under the flickering lights, one could see the arrangement of the household: simple and old furnishings, a moldy ceiling, and faded and peeling wallpapers.\u201c\u2026\u2026 The World Creation is out,\u201d the girl named Shirley exhaled softly after checking her companion\u2019s exhausted appearance. \u201cGood thing we made it back home before nightfall; otherwise, we may have to die in some smelly old gutter like a dead dog.\u201dThe skeleton hound immediately raised his head and objected: \u201cJust say it, don\u2019t bring dogs into the conversation.\u201d\u201cOh, you can still talk? I thought half your life went out the window when you jumped into the shadow rift.\u201d Shirley narrowed her eyes at her friend and commented sarcastically, \u201cYou going to explain yet? Why did we suddenly run away and use the most dangerous shadow diving method at that! Didn\u2019t you say countless demons of the Deep Sea would love to chew you out?\u201d\u201cNo matter how many demons there are in the Deep Sea, I can still avoid and dodge them. But just now\u2026\u201d Dog finally sounded like he\u2019s regained some energy and faced Shirley\u2019s accusing gaze, \u201cYou should be glad I reacted so quickly when that guy turned his attention away from us. Otherwise, we might not even have that chance to flee!\u201dShirley frowned and slowly kneeled down to eye level with her companion: \u201cSo what\u2019s going on? Why are you so scared like this? That guy named \u2018Duncan\u2019\u2026 did you meet him before? Is he some big shot from the Annihilation Sect? Or is there some demon standing behind him?\u201dThe Dark Hound, who seemed to recall some extremely terrifying picture, clattered its bones and muttered: \u201cI haven\u2019t seen him before, and I don\u2019t know him.\u201dShirley cocked an eyebrow in confusion: \u201cWhy are you so afraid if you never met him before?!\u201d\u201cEven if I haven\u2019t met him before, as a Deep Sea demon, I can \u2018see\u2019 a shadow more terrifying than death behind the guy!\u201d The Dark Hound suddenly got all serious as those hollow red eyes glowed with force, \u201cBehind the shell of that human is a vortex of light and shadow. Just staring at it is enough to TMD make me lose my sanity. How can I not be afraid of something like that?!\u201dSpeaking of this, Dog paused as if to organize the language best needed to describe his feelings to Shirley. After a good minute of silence: \u201cWhen it spoke, I could hear a thousand voices overlapping one another. It was roaring at me, a mishmash of death and life. You don\u2019t get it Shirley. The only time I ever saw anything like that was when I got an audience with the Deep Sea Lord! But the Lord doesn\u2019t move, and this person did!\u201dShirley felt her hair rising now due to the emotions transferred through her connection with Dog. Muttering as a shudder ran down her back: \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I feel anything back there then\u2026. I thought he was quite nice\u2026.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I sometimes envy you humans\u2019 with that inefficient and dull perception. The barrier of ignorance is truly a treasure this world gave your kind. Even in the face of distortionary madness, you humans can still smile and die happy.\u201d The Dark Hound suddenly deflated and lay back down again after exclaiming his own grievance, \u201cJust stay blind. This way, the world will keep looking nicer. Poor puppy I am not so lucky. Every couple of days, there would be something so scary that a dog will drop dead at a glance\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 How can the world have such a TMD cowardly demon like you?\u201d Shirley couldn\u2019t resist shooting a disappointed look at her friend before getting an idea. \u201cBut when you say it like that, I think we shouldn\u2019t have run back there\u2026 if the guy is really as powerful as you claim, wouldn\u2019t it be better to cling to his legs?! He spoke so nicely to us and clearly had more questions for us to answer. Maybe he could\u2019ve helped us deal with the suntists as well. I\u2019m quite good at acting cute, you know? Who knows\u2026.\u201dHowever, before the girl could finish speaking, the loud rattling of the chains startled her. Next, the loud exclaiming anger of the Dark Hound blasted the ears: \u201cPut away your crazy idea immediately! Your level of madness is almost enough to open the subspace channel!\u201dThen Dog paused before continuing with a warning: \u201cListen, never make deals with something that would bear the skin of a human. Those types are the most cunning and sinister of them all. They may have a peaceful conversation with you, but that\u2019s only the appetizer before the feast. Don\u2019t judge everything by the surface, okay? If you had told him everything, do you think he would\u2019ve allowed us to leave?\u201dIt seemed that the harsh tone from Dog had finally taken effect on Shirley. Sounding like a child that\u2019s made a mistake before the adult, the girl mumbled in a moping manner: \u201cI get it. Why do you sound like an old mother now\u2026.\u201dDog huffs and retorts: \u201cThat\u2019s obvious. I raised you!\u201dShirley snorted, then looked out the window where the sun\u2019s light had disappeared, replaced by the firm darkness of the night. Without another word, she inched closer to the windowsill and dragged Dog over by the belly.\u201cWhat are you doing? Can\u2019t you at least let a dog rest for a bit? I\u2019m exhausted from all the fighting today\u2026.\u201d Dog protests and bemoans.\u201cThe one who mainly fought was me, okay?\u201d Shirley glanced out at the murky glass without much emotions, \u201cI\u2019m checking the situation outside\u2026 The street lights had just come on.\u201d\u201cThis is the slums after all, you can\u2019t expect the authorities to ensure every street is maintained properly. It\u2019s good enough that they actually came on after dark to repel the evil spirits.\u201d Dog muttered, then glanced at the oil lamp on the dining table, \u201cLet\u2019s turn off the lights here. Oil is expensive.\u201dShirley pursed her lips: \u201c\u2026 I\u2019ll snuff it when I go to bed, otherwise it\u2019s too dark in the house.\u201dDog grumbled but didn\u2019t comment.In the city-state, the city managers and architects strictly planned the location of each street light to ensure coverage on every dwelling. This was the most basic device for repelling evil, and the most effective.But even the most prosperous cities have forgotten corners. For example, the slums where Shirley and Dog lived. There are far fewer gas street lights in the slums, which are older and more dilapidated than even the lower sectors. Sure, it\u2019s good enough to ensure safety during the day, but at night, such an arrangement was obviously not reassuring enough.So, the occupants here would resort to oil lamps and grease candles as precautionary measures. At the very least, until the street lamps came on if they were late.Of course, there was another important reason why many poor households used oil lamps and candles -they could not afford the relatively high cost of electricity conversion. Electric lights are bright, clean, and safe, and in a safe and secure urban area, it has long been the first choice for lighting every home. But in this dilapidated house of the slums\u2026. The only sense of security for Shirley and Dog remains to be that swaying flicker of light from the old oil lamp.\u201c\u2026 Do you still want to remain active for the next while?\u201d Dog\u2019s hoarse and rattling voice came again through the dim lighting.Shirley: \u201cMhmm.\u201dDog: \u201cYou mean making trouble for those sun mongrels, right?\u201dShirley: \u201cNot trouble, getting intel.\u201dDog: \u201cIt\u2019s not much different. From how they sounded, they aren\u2019t very clear on what happened eleven years ago either. They are asking the locals about it\u2026.\u201dShirley: \u201cThis is because the group today happened to be from Lunsa. There may be a harvest next time.\u201dDog: \u201cOkay, if that\u2019s what you want.\u201dShirley: \u201cDog, you focus on knitting me a better camouflage first. Don\u2019t leave me exposed halfway through like today.\u201dDog: \u201cI just hope we don\u2019t run into that terrible guy today. I suspect the reason why our presence got exposed early was due to such a strong \u2018interference\u2019 on the scene\u2026\u201dShirley: \u201cOkay, okay, if that\u2019s what you want to think\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 80": "Chapter 80 \u201cHome Visit!\u201dThis Translation is hosted on https://bcatranslation.com/Before the last rays of light dissipated, Duncan saw the familiar fa\u00e7ade of the antique shop again.The gas street lamps on both sides of the road had long been lit, and the slightly yellowed lights illuminated the signs and gray walls in front of the door. By the glow from the windows inside, it\u2019s clear that Nina was already inside and waiting.Strictly speaking from Duncan\u2019s point of view, he and Nina have just met. Still, for some reason, he got this inexplicable warm feeling in his heart knowing someone was waiting for him at home\u2026. But also, a hint of regret\u2026.Is this apologetic emotion because I haven\u2019t returned on time after going out?Duncan stepped forward and pushed open the door of the antique shop. With the crisp ringing of the bell, he immediately picked up on the rushing footsteps of someone running down the stairs.\u201cUncle Duncan!\u201d Nina stopped at the corner of the stairs like a gush of wind, her eyes full of surprise and joy, \u201cI thought you were again today\u2026\u201d\u201cI went around the city and lost track of time until it was already getting dark.\u201d Duncan shook his head, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I was actually going to pick you up from school at the Crossroad, but then I had an accident.\u201d\u201cYou went to the Crossroad?\u201d Nina widened her eyes in surprise and bewilderment. Then eyeing her uncle up and down to confirm the man\u2019s not drunk or under the effects of drugs, \u201cPick me up\u2026 from school?\u201dHer Uncle Duncan showed a strange and familiar side again, which left Nina unsure of how to react.\u201cI\u2019m just a little curious about your current situation at school,\u201d Duncan said casually. \u201cAnyways, you don\u2019t have to worry about me going out to drink or hang with \u2018friends\u2019 in the future. If I come back late, it\u2019s because I have business to attend to, understand?\u201dNina dumbly watched her Uncle Duncan enter the house and close the door behind himself. Even afterward, all the girl could do was nod unconsciously without uttering a single word.\u201cIt\u2019s getting late,\u201d Duncan said to Nina, who was standing at the top of the stairs, \u201cHave you eaten?\u201d\u201cUuhh\u2026 Not yet,\u201d probably because she was still not adjusted to her uncle\u2019s changes yet, Nina sounded hesitant and unsure. \u201cWhen I came back, I saw that you weren\u2019t home, so I didn\u2019t know if you would come back tonight. That\u2019s why I haven\u2019t cooked yet\u2026. But I bought some bread, I was going to\u2026\u201d\u201cBread alone isn\u2019t nutritious enough. Let\u2019s go, there\u2019s some good stuff in the kitchen,\u201d Duncan was about to climb the stairs when he cocked a smirk, \u201cI\u2019ll cook today.\u201dUncle is going to cook?!Nina seemed to have heard something straight out of a novel, that\u2019s how shocking the idea was. Then as the two crossed paths on the stairs, the young lady suddenly noticed Ai on Duncan\u2019s shoulder. \u201cUncle, this dove has been with you?\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s pretty clingy,\u201d Duncan said casually, \u201cI named it Ai.\u201d\u201cAi? What a strange name for a dove\u2026\u201d Nina scratched her hair as she followed up to the second floor. Eventually, curiosity got the better of her as the man closed in on the kitchen, \u201cDid you buy anything?\u201d\u201cActually, it\u2019s just a salted fish,\u201d Duncan found the salted fish he put in the kitchen cupboard and showed it to Nina. His face couldn\u2019t be prouder when doing so. \u201cDon\u2019t assume it\u2019s bad based on its looks. The taste is superb inside a soup.\u201d\u201cFish?!\u201d Nina\u2019s eyes widened in surprise, \u201cWhat day is it? Fish is so expensive, isn\u2019t it normally\u2026\u201dBut as the girl exclaimed, her eyes suddenly caught sight of the fish\u2019s appearance. It\u2019s an ugly thing, which left the young lady bewildered and blinking. \u201cWhat kind of fish is this? How have I not seen it before?\u201dDuncan knew that Nina would react this way.Of course, it\u2019s not that the city-state\u2019s inhabitants haven\u2019t seen fish before. Although the Boundless Sea was dangerous and full of shadowy creatures lurking under its depths, that doesn\u2019t mean they couldn\u2019t fish in the relatively safe shallows near the islands. On the contrary, it\u2019s a valuable resource that\u2019s highly prized among its citizens.Under this premise, the profession of \u201cfisherman\u201d will of course also exist.However, the world\u2019s oceans are not like the earth, and even if there are safe waters, they are only \u201csafe\u201d compared with the deeper depths. So, even if it\u2019s offshore fishing in this world, it is still a dangerous and thrilling job requiring the fishermen\u2019s greatest wits.In this case, Nina hadn\u2019t eaten fish in years. Even before her uncle fell ill, a commoner like her had little chance of seeing fish served to the table.\u201cDon\u2019t fret about its specie. Just wait and enjoy the catch.\u201d Duncan didn\u2019t want to dwell on the matter because he too didn\u2019t know what kind of fish this was. Instead, it\u2019s better to focus that energy on preparing tonight\u2019s dinner.This strange fish was not small. Even when dried, the sizable body could be sectioned off for several meals afterward. For example, the head could be turned into soup, with the rest of the body hanging on the cupboard for further air drying. This would create a more flavorful profile with time.Uncle really started cooking.Watching the familiar figure getting busy in the kitchen, Nina felt like she was in a dream.The young lady didn\u2019t really care what happened to the strange fish her uncle took out, nor did she care about tonight\u2019s dinner. Compared with these trivial things, the changes that happened to her uncle are the strangest and most worthy of her attention.The sound of knives clashing against cutting boards was heard, the gas stove was hissing, and the broth in the pot was bubbling.Nina hadn\u2019t heard these noises in how many years?Then a hint of hesitation appeared on her face after recalling something. After several minutes of being troubled inside: \u201cUncle, tomorrow\u2026. Mr. Morris is coming for a home visit.\u201d\u201cHome visit?\u201d Duncan looked stunned for a second, \u201cMr. Morris\u2026 as in your history teacher?\u201dNina nodded: \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThe teachers at that school even make home visits?\u201d Duncan threw the processed fish into the pot and glanced back at Nina in surprise while he put the knife away, \u201cI thought this was the \u2018specialty\u2019 of those schools in the upper sector only.\u201d\u201cThe school\u2026 indeed doesn\u2019t have that requirement,\u201d Nina said carefully while paying attention to Duncan\u2019s attitude, \u201cBut Mr. Morris is special. He\u2026 pay extra attention to his students.\u201dDuncan didn\u2019t speak for a while because this exceeded his expectations.He had considered dealing with the church, the police, and even the city-state navy and military if the worse occurred. Still, he never envisaged in his plan that an old man teaching history would visit him from the public schools.Why is reality always so unexpected?\u201cUncle?\u201d Nina grew a little worried after seeing Duncan didn\u2019t respond, \u201cAre you unwilling? Then I can tell Mr. Morris\u2026 In fact, I told him today. I told him your health is not very good, so I can\u2019t accept a home visit this time. He didn\u2019t say anything at that time\u2026\u201dDuncan watched Nina\u2019s somewhat nervous reaction and found a flood of emotions hidden behind that behavior.From the looks of things, this is not the first time Mr. Morris requested a home visit. How many times has Nina refused using the same excuse?\u201c\u2026\u2026 He\u2019s teaching history, right?\u201d Duncan suddenly asked again.Although she didn\u2019t know why her uncle asked this question again, Nina nodded: \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThis is a good opportunity. I happen to want to meet a professional historian,\u201d Duncan laughed, \u201cwhen is he coming over tomorrow?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 81": "Chapter 81 \u201cMemory Deviation!\u201dThis Translation is hosted on https://bcatranslation.com/The arrival of a scholar who ran to a public school to teach history for some reason was an unexpected situation for Duncan and an opportunity. Best of all, the individual seems to have an exceptional relationship with his niece Nina.Nina didn\u2019t know why her Uncle Duncan suddenly agreed to the home visit. But nevertheless, she\u2019s not going to bash a good thing. It\u2019s been a very long time since they managed to share a happy moment like this.\u201cIt\u2019s time to eat,\u201d Duncan beckoned his \u201cniece,\u201d who was in a daze, to sit at the table. He had cooked up a pot of fish stew and warmed up the bread Nina bought this afternoon. There were also some onion rings and fries he found in the grocery bag, but that\u2019s not really something he\u2019s interested in. \u201cRemember to get up early for school tomorrow.\u201d\u201cOh, okay, Uncle Duncan.\u201d Nina agreed and obediently came to the table.The aroma of fish soup had already drifted up from the table, so the smell hit the young lady as soon as she sat. With a disbelieving look at her uncle: \u201cIt\u2019s so fragrant\u2026 Uncle, when did your cooking become so good?\u201d\u201cCan this also be considered good?\u201d Duncan couldn\u2019t help but smile. Compared to Alice\u2019s headless cooking, Nina\u2019s evaluation definitely fell into line. \u201cCould it be that I was very bad at cooking?\u201d\u201cThat can no longer be described as very bad. You used to cook according to the standard of being passable as long as it doesn\u2019t kill the person. Every time you would pull me over to test the poison with you\u2026.\u201d Nina muttered, recalling the bone-chilling experience of the tastes that hit her tongue in the past. \u201cOnce you made a dish so unpalatable that you couldn\u2019t eat it yourself, you had to throw it in the trash. Then afterward, we ran over to the family restaurant next door to solve the lunch problem. When we returned, we saw the neighbor\u2019s dog lying beside the trashcan and vomiting nonstop. Since then, that dog would run away whenever he sees you\u2026\u201dAs the young lady continued, her voice expectedly grew weaker: \u201cActually, forget what I just said. You never did like it when I mention these things\u2026.\u201dDuncan was silent.In the remaining memories of this body, there was nothing of that sort mentioned by Nina. In fact, those fragments only contained the happiness they shared. Guess there were also a lot of weird and silly interactions that dissipated following the man\u2019s death. Duncan would need to be more careful when touching such subjects.As Nina silently broke a piece of the hard bread and dunked it into the delicious broth, Duncan took this opportunity to reach out and rub the child\u2019s hair.\u201cUncle?\u201d The girl looks up in surprise.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Your uncle\u2019s research on the new dish was successful.\u201d Duncan said solemnly like he meant it.The two exchanged a long look with each other as if to confirm whether the other was lying. Then out of the blue, the girl broke out into a hysterical laugh: \u201cUncle, you look so funny!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t make fun of adults,\u201d Duncan shot a sideway glance at Nina while smirking mischievously, \u201cOh right, I intend to tidy up the store in the coming days. So if you see any strange objects lying around that you don\u2019t recognize, don\u2019t touch them until I come back.\u201dHe\u2019s preparing for the next shuttling of items between the two places as he develops Ai\u2019s ability. Unfortunately, there are bound to be items he couldn\u2019t hide from Nina\u2019s eyes, so it\u2019s better if he gets her vaccinated for the changes in advance.Nina didn\u2019t suspect anything and quickly nodded as the ghost captain continued: \u201cI also plan to add an extra hand in the store to look after things. This is in case I go out during the day, so don\u2019t get surprised if you find a stranger in the store, okay?\u201dThis time, he was paving the way for Alice\u2019s arrival.There are still many things to consider before letting the puppet doll enter Pland. Like making sure Alice\u2019s supernatural existence wouldn\u2019t cause harm to the surroundings or covering up those joints so others wouldn\u2019t realize she\u2019s a puppet. But most importantly, he needs to figure out how to keep that head screwed on properly without falling off randomly.Nina looked at Duncan in surprise: \u201cUncle, you\u2019re even hiring a new clerk to help with the store? That\u2019s a big deal\u2026. Have you chosen someone yet? What kind of person are they?\u201dDuncan thought for a moment, trying to filter out a long list of not-so-good adjectives out of his head until he grimaced. There are really not many positives he could say.\u201cThat\u2019s uhhh\u2026. a hard-working young lady.\u201d In the end, the only word he could use to describe Alice in a positive light was \u201chard-working\u201d.Then he saw the expression on Nina\u2019s face change subtly.The girl was eyeing her uncle up and down until she couldn\u2019t hold back: \u201cYoung lady? Uncle, are you\u2026\u201dDuncan had experience in this field, so he knew exactly what the niece was thinking. Immediately knocking the table to reimpose his status as the elder: \u201cFocus on dinner! Quit thinking about other things!\u201dNina immediately held back her laughter and made a \u201cscream\u201d inside. The nosy inner fairy was running amok right now. However, that giggling delight was promptly replaced by a widened eye surprised face after tasting the fish: \u201cIt\u2019s so good~!\u201dDuncan laughed while breaking some of the bread to feed Ai. \u201cThen eat more. There\u2019s still some more in the kitchen.\u201dJust like that, Nina and her Uncle Duncan shared a warm and happy dinner that hadn\u2019t been possible inside this antique shop for many years.And after everything was cleaned up after dinner, Duncan stopped the girl again, who was about to return to her room for rest.He had something to confirm.\u201cNina, I have something I want to ask you.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Nina grew curious, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cDo you remember\u2026 things from when you were a child?\u201d Duncan deliberated on where to start and recalled what he had heard from the cultists. \u201cThe stuff that happened when you were six.\u201dNina frowned over the odd question. She didn\u2019t know why her uncle suddenly mentioned the old incident eleven years ago.Eleven years have passed, and she was only six years back then, so her memories aren\u2019t the greatest. As such, her heart didn\u2019t feel too much sadness when mentioning the tragedy back then.\u201cI was young and can\u2019t remember many things, but I do remember it was a mess\u2026 There were panicking adults everywhere. Some say there was a factory leak near the Crossroad. Others claim there was a collective frenzy in the Lower Third Street. Some even claimed it happened in the Upper Sector too\u2026 Most of what I know was retold to me by the adults later on\u2026\u201dDuncan thought for a moment and locked eyes with Nina\u2019s: \u201cThen do you remember a fire? I fled from that big fire with you. Your parents\u2026 they were in that fire\u2026\u201dHe only tentatively mentioned it, but he didn\u2019t expect Nina to suddenly widen her eyes and react so strongly: \u201cFire? Uncle, you really remember that there was a big fire at that time?!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 Of course I remember,\u201d Duncan knew that something was really wrong based upon Nina\u2019s reaction, \u201cIs it wrong that I remember there\u2019s a fire?\u201d\u201cI also remember that there was a huge fire,\u201d Nina said quickly, a little excited even. \u201cBut when I told the adults around me, no one could remember it. They all said I was scared and imagining things. There was no place to catch fire\u2026 Then later, when I grew older, I even went out of my way to find the original newspaper\u2026\u201dSpeaking of this, she stopped and slowly shook her head with a strange expression: \u201cBut even the newspaper didn\u2019t mention any fire\u2026 All the records say that there was a leak in a factory. The chemicals caused widespread hallucinations\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 82": "Chapter 82 \u201cThe Fire That Exists Only In Memory!\u201dThis Translation is hosted on https://bcatranslation.com/Nina went back to her room and slept.In this world, most people go to bed early and get up early because the time after the sun recedes is dangerous. The shimmer of the World\u2019s Creation could make the world warp to its peak, and even if there are lights in the city, people must still face the night with caution.Duncan didn\u2019t feel the slightest bit sleepy tonight though. He turned off the lights in the house and came to the window in his shirt, casually admiring the night view of the city-state of Pland while reminiscing about his conversation with Nina after dinner.Nina remembers a fire, and the rest of his body remembers when they fled from that collapsing building. That night, the streets were in a frenzy, with cries and screams of fear shrouded in the fog. Yet, only the two of them remember that dreadful flame in this modern day.Nina had spoken to other adults about it of course. However, they all dismissed it as a deranged memory after a child experienced some traumatic event. This was reinforced by the newspaper from eleven years ago claiming there\u2019s only a factory leak at the lower sector near the Crossroad.Duncan frowned slightly, musing over another suspicious point he found \u2013 that was \u201chimself\u201d.According to Nina\u2019s recount, \u201cUncle Duncan\u201d doesn\u2019t remember the fire. Only she does. The girl even mentioned it to Uncle Duncan (although it should be \u201cRon\u201d at the time) when she was a child. However, like all the other adults, her Uncle Duncan dismissed the idea of the kid being scared and hallucinating.Where did things go wrong? Why did Nina\u2019s uncle not remember the fire at all, yet I can clearly find the corresponding image in the depths of this body? Is that Ron lying to his niece all this time? Or was the memory unsealed because I took over this body?Duncan unconsciously tapped his fingers on the windowsill, silently mulling over the timeline.According to what he gathered from the Sunists:Eleven years ago, the sun fragment first appeared in the territory of the city-state of Pland, causing a large range vision to occur inside the city limits. That\u2019s also the year Nina became orphaned. Even though many civilians were affected, no one seemed to remember the fire besides from Nina.Since then, the sun fragment has been dormant with no signs of further activity.Then moving forward to four years ago, the followers of the sun god tried to awaken the sleeping sun fragment again. That incident got extinguished by the newly promoted Inquisitor Vanna and dealt a heavy blow to those cultists. Since then, the church of the sun was effectively expelled from Pland following that massive purge.However, that doesn\u2019t mean the failed ritual didn\u2019t have an effect. On the contrary, the energy gathered from the dead had stirred the slumbering sun fragment.At that time, the \u201cuncle\u201d, who Nina had depended on since being orphaned, contracted a strange disease. The illness eventually tormented the man to the point that he would resort to any remedy, including joining the ranks of the sun cult as a minion.Moving further forward to a time not long ago. The news of the active sun fragment began attracting suntists to re-gather in the city to hold a sacrificial ceremony. That\u2019s when Duncan happened to step in and get involved.Throughout the timeline, many things seem to be faintly connected, but all lack key evidence to prove.But the most suspicious thing remains to be the event from eleven years ago when the sun fragment caused a huge vision.Did the city-state authorities erase the truth of that accident and erase the traces of the fire? And then for the sake of maintaining order, the whole thing was publicized as a collective hallucination caused by a leak in the factory?But that doesn\u2019t explain why the fire doesn\u2019t exist in many people\u2019s memories at all \u2013 unless the authorities have gone to great lengths to reshape the memories of all involved.And there is another point. In this world, anomalies and visions are open to the public. So even children know the existence and harmfulness of supernatural things. The authorities are obviously aware of this and have always adhered to the policy of announcing dangers in advance to ensure that citizens have a sense of self-preservation. So if it is really just a fire caused by supernatural powers\u2026 why do they have to hide it?Unless\u2026\u2026 There is a more significant issue behind the fire, so much so that even the disclosure of news can cause some domino effect of spreading.Duncan frowned suddenly at thinking this.Or there is another possibility\u2026.The phenomenon is strange in nature. In many cases, the harm it causes is not only limited to the physical level but even distorts human cognition and the information written down on paper. What if\u2026. What if the sun fragment had contaminated everything from civilians to the very top of the city government?A part of Duncan felt like he was going a little too far in his theories. As a novice in the field of supernatural events, his imagination lacked credible support. But on the other hand, he also couldn\u2019t stop driving toward these theories.People\u2019s memories, the authorities\u2019 records, and even the archives written a decade ago could be distorted and replaced. Of course, something like that would\u2019ve been dismissed by him right away in the past. However, he couldn\u2019t be a stronger believer in this phenomonon.Why? Because the place where he was located now was called \u201cDuncan Antique Shop\u201d, a business that specializes in selling counterfeits to the locals.With a gentle sigh, Duncan lowered his head and looked through the second-floor window and onto the street illuminated by gas lamps.Now there was only one question left \u2013 why does Nina remember the fire when everything else said otherwise. This was crucial and the key to solving the big question.\u2026\u2026Upper Sector of Pland, in a mansion belonging to the managing official.Vanna jerks awake from a terrible nightmare.But this time, the nightmare was no longer related to the Black Sun like it usually does, nor did it point to the Vanished returning from subspace. Instead, she dreamt about what happened when she was a child.That foggy night where it\u2019s filled with blood and smoke, all she could remember were the horrendous screams of panicking mobs trying to flee from the pursuing shadows. All Vanna could do as a helpless child of twelve was watch it all burn.Knowing she would not get any rest tonight, the inquisitor pulled herself up from bed and came before the dresser where a mirror stood. Looking at her own reflection, the lady was clearly not feeling well until she whispered the storm goddess\u2019s name. Once done, a wave of peace and clarity returned to the female inquisitor.\u201cAt least I\u2019m not dreaming of that ship now\u2026\u201dAs soon as her voice fell, the lady suddenly heard footsteps from the corridor where a knock promptly came from the door: \u201cVanna?

The hideous scars from eleven years would\u2019ve scared any unfamiliar adult, let alone a child. Still, Vanna knew how kind and fair her uncle was at heart despite the stern face.\u201cYaaa, I had a nightmare,\u201d she rubbed those eyes, her tone a little helpless, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to wake you up.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t fret about it.

She was more than a head taller than her uncle, but the lady never minded showing her true side in front of this elder who effectively raised herself. \u201cI am distressed.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 Did you talk to Heidi yet?\u201d\u201cShe recommended four types of brain surgeries and two nerve puncture treatments,\u201d Vanna sighed, \u201cGiven the years of friendship we have, I didn\u2019t beat her.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 That\u2019s definitely something she would say, after all, she doesn\u2019t deal with normal people that often.\u201d Dante Wayne shook his head, \u201cActually, I didn\u2019t expect that after all these years, you were still trapped by the nightmare of that night.\u201d\u201cI thought I had come out of it too.\u201d Vanna rubbed her temple, \u201cMaybe it really has something to do with this big house. As soon as I return here, I will dream about what it was like\u2026 Maybe I should consider holding another exorcism ceremony for this house, otherwise I will keep thinking this house carries the shadow of that disaster\u2026\u201dUncle Dante contemplated the suggestion and didn\u2019t raise an objection. \u201cIs there still that fire in your nightmare this time?\u201dVanna nodded: \u201cYes, there are fires everywhere. You escaped from the fire with me on your back. I even remember clearly that we fled the city from the factory\u2019s pipeline, and a burning building nearby was gradually collapsing in the fire\u2026\u201dSpeaking of this, she stopped and landed her gaze on her uncle: \u201c\u2026 You don\u2019t remember the fire, do you?\u201d\u201cNot only do I not remember, nobody else does.\u201d The serious-faced administrator slowly shook his head, \u201cI only remember the leaked gas pipes and those cultists who went berserk\u2026 There were many parties that night, but only one seemed to remember seeing the raging fire.\u201dVanna didn\u2019t speak for a while and fell into deep thought. Then after an unknown amount of time, she suddenly said softly: \u201cExcept for the \u2018fire\u2019 incident, my memories and yours are consistent\u2026 I didn\u2019t understand anything back then, but now I know very well that this must be some kind of supernatural force exerting influence. Even after becoming a saint, I still can\u2019t dispel that influence.\u201d\u201cThere could only be two answers. The one responsible is so powerful that they left an imprint on your soul for life, or the source of the influence of that incident remains hidden somewhere in the city. I have been investigating this matter for years, but unfortunately, there has been little progress thus far.\u201dDante Wayne\u2019s tone ended with a hint of apologies. Not only for being unable to solve his niece\u2019s distress but also for failing to investigate an old case as the highest government official.The \u201cGreat Chaos\u201d eleven years ago left a scar that\u2019s far too deep, both physically and mentally on everyone involved.Vanna knew that this matter was not only her own phantom at work, but also a plague on her uncle\u2019s heart. Not knowing how to comfort others well, the inquisitor could only try to divert the topic: \u201cI remember that a lot of cultists were arrested back then. Judging from the assessment count after the engagement, that incident was even larger than the \u2018Black Sun\u2019 incident four years ago.\u201d\u201cYes, thousands of people were arrested, so many that I wondered how it\u2019s possible for so many cultists to hide inside Pland unnoticed.\u201d Dante Wayne sighed, \u201cAnd there is more than one sect involved\u2026 There are the Suntists who follow the black sun, Annihilators who worship the Nether Lord, and even those Ender missionaries who worship subspace itself\u2026 These maggots in the gutters all emerged that night, deranged and wreaked havoc.\u201dVanna stared at Dante with more intent now: \u201cBut according to the results of the subsequent interrogation, none of the saboteurs arrested by the authorities can be called the \u2018mastermind\u2019. No one even knows why they caused chaos that night. It was as if they were all detonated at the same time and went into collective madness.\u201dDante didn\u2019t speak for a while for he too believed it was not normal. Then he noticed the look coming from his niece: \u201cThe reason for your irritability should not just be because of that nightmare is it? Suddenly mentioning these things is related to the recent unstable situation in the city-state?\u201dVanna did not evade the question: \u201cThere is indeed a certain connection. The suntists converging on Pland are searching for an \u2018anomaly\u2019 called the sun fragment, and the Vanished has reappeared in the real world almost simultaneously. Everything is pointing to us here, reminding me of the chaos from eleven years ago.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 I have ordered all ports to strictly check the movement of people and communicated with the other administrators of neighboring city-states. We\u2019ve already cracked down on many cultists and effectively cut off their means of flowing into Pland because of these measures. All that\u2019s left to do is to wait on what the church does. The supernatural area is the specialty of the guardians.\u201dSpeaking of this, the middle-aged admin suddenly stopped as if to ponder his following words. But after a moment of hesitation, he decides it\u2019s best to say it: \u201cAs for the matter of the Vanished, I can\u2019t help much in the transcendent realm, but in the worldly aspect, I have an idea.\u201d\u201cSecular aspect?\u201d Vanna frowned, \u201cWait, you mean\u2026\u201d\u201cLucretia Abnomar, captain of the pioneer exploration ship Bright Star, and Tyrian Abnomar, the pirate leader of the Northern Seas and captain of the Sea Mist,\u201d Dante said unhurriedly. \u201cIt is true that the Vanished is a ghost ship beyond the understanding of reality, but as long as it has been a member of the real world, the real world will have an anchor related to it. I wonder how Captain Duncan\u2019s son and daughter will react to their father\u2019s reappearance in the world.\u201dVanna\u2019s eyes slowly widened. She was used to using simple and crude methods to directly deal with her enemies, so she had never considered anything related to the Vanished from this perspective. But soon the lady frowned: \u201cBut I heard those two hardly deal with the city-state authorities\u2026 They are rulers of their own turf on the Boundless Sea and maintains a cold relationship with the city-states.\u201d\u201cThis is normal, after all, they are the children of that ghost captain. The Bright Star and the Sea Mist are the two escorts of the original Vanished. Although they parted ways a hundred years ago, in the eyes of most city-states, they are still the embodiment of curses and dangers. It is not so much they alienated the civilized world, but rather the civilized world actively avoids them.\u201dVanna frowned and appeared wary at her uncle\u2019s plan: \u201cThen do you expect them to come and help Pland against their father?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just an idea, but it\u2019s worth a try.\u201d Dante grew serious, \u201cAfter all, we all know that the Bright Star and Sea Mist parted ways with the Vanished more than a century ago. That happened before the event on the Thirteen Islands of Witherland. Rumor is that some ship captains witnessed the Sea Mist battle the Vanished in the northern seas half a century ago. At that point, the Vanished had already become the legendary ghost ship. This may explain the attitude of the two captains towards their father.\u201d\u201cMore than half a century ago\u2026 At that time, the Sea Mist was still the flagship of the Frost Queen. That Captain Tyrian was probably just being ordered to protect the city-state,\u201d Vanna said slowly while pondering. \u201cBut you are right. At least this proves that the Sea Mist has a record of confrontation with the Vanished.\u201dBut she still had some doubts, which she voiced after a few seconds of thought: \u201cWhat if the Bright Star and Sea Mist ignored Pland, what then?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why this is just an attempt,\u201d Dante said quietly, \u201cand I\u2019ll spread the word and find a way to get the news into the ears of those two captains. After that, we can only wait and watch for their reaction afterward.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 84": "Chapter 84 \u201cCaptain Duncan\u2019s Offspring\u201dThis Translation is hosted on https://bcatranslation.com/Even ghosts were once members of the real world, and the Vanished was no different despite the fact that it crashed into subspace a century ago. It\u2019s built by real craftsmen from the material world, and Captain Duncan was also a human being before turning into a shadow of subspace.For ordinary seafarers, everything related to the Vanished must be veiled with a layer of \u201ccurses\u201d and \u201cfreakiness\u201d, as if the terrifying ghost captain was a creation directly bred from subspace. No one will think about whether a natural disaster wandering on the sea has any personal joy or anger, nor about his interpersonal relationships. In their minds, \u201cCaptain Duncan\u201d symbolizes a natural phenomenon, an existence without a trace of origin.Fear builds walls in human hearts, and walls blind the souls to the truth on the other side. But as an inquisitor specializing in confronting of this fear, Vanna knows how to discern the true parts from a series of legends, exaggerations, and whispers.The terrible captain of the Vanished\u2026 when he was still a human, before the events of the Thirteen Islands of Witherland, also had his best friends and family members. He also had loyal sailors and adjutants under him. He also needed to go to the port to maintain supplies and deal with the city-state authorities.He couldn\u2019t have been born a mobile natural disaster.Captain Duncan also had two children, the eldest son Tyrian Abnomar, and his daughter Lucretia Abnomar. They are both alive due to a curse that prolonged their lifespan.Like their father, the two children also commanded their own powerful ships that hovered on the fringes of the civilized world. As within expectation, they weren\u2019t exactly kind to the civilization either. They\u2019re cold, vaguely antagonistic to the point sailors wouldn\u2019t even dare to link the pair to the infamous Captain Duncan. Nowadays, only the most well-learned and knowledgeable are aware of the family relationship.On the other hand, despite their frosty relationship with the city-states, the two captains weren\u2019t hostile either.The Bright Star, helmed by Ms. Lucretia Abnomar, was a mighty, pioneering exploration ship passionate about exploring the world\u2019s limits. Rumor has it the ship has even reached the very edge of the known world, where she witnessed unimaginable wonders.No one knows exactly what she was looking for on the edge of the world. Still, on rare occasions that she did report back to the adventurer\u2019s guilds through a messenger, the stories told reported were worthy of being turned into books and a medal of honor. Of course, no one would consider it an honor if it meant becoming a living curse. Nevertheless, this was proof of goodwill that she was still on the side of humanity.Tyrian Abnomar, on the other hand, was less fleeting and distant than his sister. The man was closer to the human world and definitely more dangerous. More than half a century ago, he served the Frost City-State of the Northern Seas, and now he\u2019s the most powerful pirate captain sailing these icy waters.This moody captain controlled nearly half of the main shipping routes of the Cold Sea. With the Sea Mist as its flagship, he commanded more than a dozen warships under its banner. But in reality, he had already surpassed a simple pirate and grown to become a semi-official power outside of the city-states.As for how this Captain Tyrian went from being a general under the Queen of Frost to becoming a pirate head, people had different theories \u2013Some say he was the mastermind of the Frostbite Rebellion half a century ago \u2013 the man who personally put the Frost Queen on the guillotine. Then using the looted wealth from that city-state, he built up his powerful pirate crew.Another version was the opposite: a few scholars believe that Tyrian Abnomar fought for the queen until the last moment during the Frostbite Rebellion. That he became a pirate out of spite for the other city-states and menaced the shipping route out of obsession with avenging the queen.Vanna didn\u2019t know how much of the speculation in this chaotic world was true or false, and considering the personalities of the two captains, they should not be interested in explaining their affairs to the world. But one thing was certain: the reappearance of the Vanished was definitely a major event for them that needed attention.After all, the siblings had betrayed the Vanished with their respective ships more than a century ago, and now their furious father had returned from subspace.Of course, as Dante Wayne said, this was just a spare card. It\u2019s great if the card comes in handy, but one couldn\u2019t rely on such a card.\u2026\u2026When the bell tower of the neighborhood church rang, the special rhythm of the whistle also broke the silence of the night, signaling the city residents to be awake and go about their day.Nina got up early to prepare breakfast today. Therefore, Duncan\u2019s nose was already hit with the aroma of mushroom sauce and bread before he managed to dispel the drowsiness in his body.Sitting at the dining table.\u201cDo you want a bicycle?\u201d He asks after noticing a bunch of people riding along the streets outside the window.\u201cBicycle?\u201d Nina was stunned for a moment and waved her hand, \u201cThat\u2019s so expensive\u2026 and I don\u2019t need it.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s easier to go to school,\u201d Duncan said, \u201cyou don\u2019t have to worry about money. I\u2019ll figure it out.\u201dHe had thought about it seriously already. Although this antique store did not look good, but judging by the accumulation and rotation of goods in the warehouse and the cash stored in the shop, it should actually have stable weekly sales. Definitely more than enough to feed two people.As to why Nina\u2019s so strapped in her spending, that\u2019s entirely due to the former uncle donating over half of his wealth to the cult. The remaining got squandered on spirits and medicine.Now that this depraved living was over, it\u2019s only proper that Nina got a better living standard.Of course, he doesn\u2019t know how to run a store, and the few purchase channels he knows in his memory are also a little vague. Nevertheless, he would manage somehow if he slowly adapted\u2026.The key was to get Nina accustomed to her \u201cuncle\u201d becoming a reliable elder again.\u201cBut that\u2019s so expensive\u2026\u201d Nina lowered her head and muttered, then bit into the hard bread.Duncan wanted to say something to that when his voice got interrupted by a knock from the first floor.\u201cSo early\u2026 who could it be when we\u2019re not even open yet?\u201d Nina was stunned for a moment when she heard the knock. Getting up, she hurried downstairs, \u201cI\u2019ll go down and check!\u201dWatching the fleeing girl, Duncan broke a piece of bread and threw it at the dove who was pacing around the table: \u201cYou say\u2026 in addition to opening a normal store, what other way is there to make money relatively fast\u2026. Do we need to open a logistics company?\u201dThe bird suddenly jumped two steps to the side, flapping its wings angrily: \u201cBut it is not amusing to me!\u201dThen she began to yap nonstop, \u201cThat bastard is furious and picked up the Demonic Snake Spear to sacrifice Elder Tang to the stake! I will karate chop with a spinning dragon kick! There will be blood on his head! FULL SCREEN AHEAD!!!\u201dDuncan\u2019s whole person was dumbfounded: \u201c\u2026\u201dHe could not understand a single thing the bird just spoke after Nina left there. But he couldn\u2019t blame Ai for bursting out like this. She must\u2019ve been a mess inside at holding back her urge to speak.Then before the dove could yap some more, Nina\u2019s voice suddenly came from the first floor. This time, the young lady\u2019s voice sounded a little nervous: \u201cUncle Duncan! Th-There are two policemen here to see you\u2026\u201dPolice? Two of them came to see me this early in the morning?This time it was Duncan\u2019s turn to be stunned. Immediately ordering the bird to stay put and out of sight, he hurried downstairs where he saw Nina looking over his way nervously. Two policemen were standing at the doorway.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 85": "Chapter 85 \u201cReward\u201dThis Translation is hosted on https://bcatranslation.com/Duncan affirmed his composure and walked towards the two policemen at the door.He had nothing to fear in any case. The guy did not do any sabotage, nor did he have any conflict with the authorities. Although Captain Duncan was infamous around these parts, but what did the mobile natural disaster of the Boundless Sea have to do with this honest antique store owner?If there\u2019s anything to be suspicious about, it would only be the fact that he attended the cultist gathering before running off to report it!Wait a minute\u2026\u2026 report?Duncan suddenly remembered this stubble and immediately got a vague guess as to the reason why the two policemen came to his residence. Now he\u2019s even more confident in his footsteps, but that obviously didn\u2019t translate to Nina\u2019s nerve.\u201cUncle, you must answer the policemen\u2019s question honestly\u2026\u201d the young lady urgently murmurs as she brushes shoulders with her uncle.Duncan suddenly faltered and casts a strange look at his \u201cniece\u201d: \u201cIs that the image I have in your heart?\u201dNina returned the look with a face that was even more exaggerated. It\u2019s the same type of expression that happens when an alcoholic swears he won\u2019t be drinking again. \u201c\u2026. Then what else could the police come for this early in the morning?\u201dDuncan: \u201c\u2026\u201dHe sighed helplessly and finished the distance to the door with a big, bright smile. \u201cGood morning gents. What can I do for the both of you?\u201d\u201cMr. Duncan,\u201d the older of the two policemen began with a polite and businesslike tone, \u201cwe found this place according to the registered address. The tip you reported to the patrol officers yesterday has been confirmed. On behalf of City Hall, we thank you for your contribution in helping with the maintenance of order. We\u2019re also here to hand you your reward.\u201dWhen the words fell, the young officer next to him stepped forward and handed over a paper envelope that looked quite thick.Nina had widened her eyes from the sidelines after seeing the parcel.Duncan had guessed as much. However, he didn\u2019t expect the reward money to be directly brought to his door like this. Not being shy, he accepted the package and was surprised when he saw the words \u201c435 Sora\u201d imprinted on the disposable wax seal. That\u2019s a generous amount for any residence in the lower sector.\u201cSo there\u2019s a bounty reward\u2026\u201d Duncan squeezed the paper parcel and relished in the thickness of the banknotes, \u201cI wasn\u2019t even thinking about it at the time.\u201d\u201cOf course there is a bounty. The admittaturs pay great heed to the fight against the evil lurking inside the city-state, especially in recent times. All valid reports are rewarded generously, so do keep that in mind.\u201d The younger officer chuckles with amusement at the shop owner\u2019s lack of awareness, \u201cNot to mention the clues you provided are\u2026 very special.\u201dHearing this, Duncan\u2019s heart couldn\u2019t help but jerk with attention. Acting casually like he\u2019s only curious: \u201cBy the way, I didn\u2019t dare to go over there and take a look for myself, but what exactly happened?\u201dThe two officers exchanged a look with each other and then actually stepped inside the shop. Nina didn\u2019t miss this and promptly closed the door behind everyone.\u201cWe did not go to the scene ourselves. The matter was dealt with by the guardians. However, according to the information that came through the proper channels\u2026 the situation was terrible,\u201d said the younger officer, who had not yet fully learned the businesslike tone of his senior. \u201cYou were right to not take a look. If you had gone, you would\u2019ve likely fallen into severe danger.\u201dDuncan was stunned for a moment before quickly coming back to attention.This was the lower sector, where sewage and toxins flow from the upper sector. If heretics and evil were to take up residence, it would surely be in these shabby and winding alleys.Although the neighborhood where the antique shop was located could already be considered a decent place in the lower sector, it still doesn\u2019t change the fact that it\u2019s part of the lower sector. Slum or no slum.On the other hand, even if we did not consider there may be cultists lurking among ordinary folks in the lower sector, a person who \u201creports to the authorities and collects a bounty\u201d was very likely to be the target of vigilance here anyway.The officers who are familiar with the local situation certainly know this; therefore, the reminder here was a routine habit and a deed out of good intentions.Duncan thought about it and felt that the reminder was right as well.This place was indeed prone to cultists\u2014he still has the sun talisman in his pocket.\u201cThank you for the reminder,\u201d he thanked the two sincerely. Although the ghost captain didn\u2019t know what the average standard here was, but at least the two in front gave a good impression. \u201cDo you want to take a break here?\u201d\u201cNo need,\u201d the older officer waved his hand and turned toward the exit, \u201cwe still have patrol duty that must be attended to.\u201dThe young officer promptly followed as well: \u201cIf you still encounter clues in the future, please report it to the authorities. The security of the city-state affects each and every one of us.\u201d\u201cOf course,\u201d Duncan squeezed the paper bag in his hand and formed a genuine smile, \u201cI have always been a good citizen who cares about the order of the city-state.\u201dOnce the two men wearing the dark blue uniforms were out of sight, Nina immediately turned back to look at her uncle, who was already counting the money bills inside. \u201cUncle\u2026 Is this really a reward from City Hall? You actually\u2026 really\u2026\u201dThe girl opened her mouth but found it awkward to speak the next part. \u201cYou can really do good things.\u201dDuncan knew what Nina was thinking and chuckled at her troubled mindset: \u201cIt was when I was coming home yesterday. Your uncle I have always been enthusiastic about public welfare.\u201dNina: \u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cBut I was surprised to have such a huge bounty reward.\u201d Duncan didn\u2019t wait for Nina to speak to mutter his inner greed while looking down at the banknotes, \u201cThis is faster than making money from the shop\u2026.\u201dThere was another sentence he didn\u2019t say: According to the information he had before, there were still many cultists from various city-states hiding in the city.That\u2019s all money!Nina took a good moment to return to her senses: \u201cUncle, what did you say?\u201d\u201cNothing, forget what I said,\u201d Duncan said casually and waved the topic off. \u201cWeren\u2019t you going to school today? Don\u2019t be late. By the way, when is Mr. Morris coming for the home visit?\u201d\u201cIn the afternoon, I only have one class in the afternoon,\u201d Nina said, as if thinking of something, \u201cUncle, are you still going out today?\u201dDuncan nodded, \u201cMhmm, but I\u2019ll be home before your history teacher comes.\u201dWhen Nina heard this, she immediately looked suspiciously over his way: \u201cUncle, what are you going to do?\u201dDuncan smiled extraordinarily brightly: \u201cYour uncle is going out hunting today.\u201dHe already got an idea in mind. Since the sun talisman was so easy to use, plus the authorities are so willing to offer up a bounty, so why not take advantage of this point? He\u2019s going to make trouble for these suntists anyway. No reason not to kill two birds with one stone.Nina was a smart girl. Even if she doesn\u2019t know the full story, she could already guess what Duncan meant by \u201chunting\u201d in this case. With a wrinkled forehead: \u201c\u2026 Uncle, it\u2019s not right for you to do this. You also said yesterday that you want to properly operate the shop. If you want to rectify the situation with the shop, then you need to recruit an assistant first\u2026\u201d\u201cI know, I know, but there\u2019s no contradiction in running a shop and helping with the city\u2019s security, is there?\u201d Duncan waved his hand to reassure his niece, \u201cLet your uncle here worry about the shop. You focus on school first.\u201dYet, instead of doing as told, Nina promptly grabbed a chair and sat down next to him with a firm face.\u201cNina?\u201d\u201cUncle, it\u2019s so dangerous.\u201d Nina looked up and stared at her precious uncle.Duncan: \u201cUhhh\u2026 actually\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to keep an eye on you,\u201d Nina sat there stubbornly, \u201cjust now those two gentlemen already mentioned how dangerous it is as of late\u2026. It\u2019s one thing that you accidentally encountered the matter. How can you actively go out to search for such dangers?\u201dDuncan was taken aback by the seventeen-year-old girl\u2019s statement because she really does care for him. Though the way was stubborn and crude, but it was from the heart.\u201cI don\u2019t want a bike.\u201d Nina lowered her head and muttered quietly.\u201cGo to school.\u201d Duncan sighed and stepped forward with a smile, then ruffled Nina\u2019s hair.Nina looked up in surprise.\u201cYou\u2019re right, it\u2019s dangerous,\u201d Duncan said seriously, \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere. I\u2019ll wait here in the store for you to come back.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Although it was not yet possible to fully share the five senses, this level of perception could already do a lot of things.Duncan lowered his head and stared into Ai little mungbean eyes: \u201cYou are actually very smart. Not only can you fully understand my words, but you can also do many things, right?\u201dThe dove immediately flapped its wings proudly: \u201cLoyalty, loyalty!\u201d\u201cThen I have a bold idea right now. I want you to try it.\u201d Duncan smiled, then took out the sun talisman that had now become a \u201ccultist approach alarm\u201d from his pocket.He carefully wrapped the badge with a cloth to prevent it from being exposed to ordinary people and then tied it to Ai\u2019s back with a strip of fabric.\u201cGo fly around town, and when the badge heats up, search for the place that resonates. Preferably directly to the building,\u201d Duncan explains his intent, \u201cI will keep track of the location from my end\u2026 Right, first fly around the lower sector and the Crossroad. Don\u2019t go to the upper sector yet since I\u2019m not familiar with that area. I can\u2019t determine the address based on the positioning alone.\u201dThe dove flapped her wings and tilted its head: \u201cMake some fries?\u201dDuncan grimaced: \u201cIf you can locate one place, then I will bury you with fries.\u201dWithout saying a word, the bird flapped its wings and rushed out the gate as if afraid the owner would regret the agreement.The ghost captain watched with a smile as the bird flew away in the sky. With his tracking ability of Ai improved, the man could clearly perceive the dove\u2019s movement through the ghost fire. Then by matching the approximate location in his head to a map, Duncan should be able to pinpoint anything they find along the way.Exhaling softly, he leans back against the counter to comfortably wait. He promised Nina that he wouldn\u2019t go out \u201casking for danger\u201d, so it\u2019s only natural he kept his promise. However, he never said anything about not writing report letters to the authority from his home\u2026..To be fair, this was a better solution since Ai could cover more distances and increase the range by wandering the city. Of course, this method also had disadvantages, and that was not being able to gather intel from the cultists.But Duncan didn\u2019t care much about this regret. According to the experience of attending the last rally, those cultists who could easily be found were actually a group of minions that were disposable by those in charge. The big fish would need to be uncovered differently, hence why the ghost captain would change the plan.Also, let\u2019s not forget Ai had more ability than just flying around with a sensor \u2013 her job was express delivery\u2026.Imagine finding a big fish who was unprepared. Ai could swoop in and transport the foe onto the Vanished. By that point, haha\u2026. There\u2019s no escape for the poor sucker by that point. Duncan could take his sweet, sweet time interrogating the prisoner.Then to top things off with a cherry, he hadn\u2019t experimented with transporting live humans yet\u2026 Duncan wouldn\u2019t kidnap random people off the street for his own gains, but he wouldn\u2019t have any qualms about experimenting with ruthless cultists that committed mass murder.When necessary, even pure trash could be suitable \u201cconsumables\u201d.Duncan leaned back in his chair and relished in his own ingenuity. The only problem now was to consider how he would explain this to Nina why the authorities would issue so many reward bounties to her uncle.As the man dwelled on the matter, another idea suddenly popped up: is there such a thing as banks in this world that\u2019s developed into the industrial age?This was the inevitable result and a necessary condition for developing the world\u2019s economy.Although this world\u2019s banking system should be far less convenient and widespread than on Earth, the minimum account function should still be there.And of course, the original owner of this body did not have a bank account. The man hadn\u2019t done well in life so it\u2019s pointless to do so. What\u2019s more, the bank services are usually reserved for those living in the upper sector since those like Nina\u2019s family had little spare funds to speak of. Even so, banks are technically open to all walks of life regardless of one\u2019s status.As it so happens, there\u2019s a bank at the Crossroad that he could visit.Making up his mind, Duncan intends to make a visit within the next two days. His activities are going to expand rapidly at this rate. It\u2019s crucial he got the foundation down before things really gathered steam. Besides, giving a bank account number in the report letters would mean he could skip leaving his personal address directly on the papers.Of course, whether this was feasible will have to be tried later, after all, the original owner of his body has little experience with the city-state security department (or strictly speaking, much positive experience), but Duncan thinks it was reasonable enough.In this dangerous world, anonymous reporting should be a normal choice for many enthusiastic citizens working under caution.As for today\u2026 he\u2019s going to stay in the antique shop and relax. He still hasn\u2019t personally opened up this business yet, so it\u2019s about time he got to it.Duncan stretched and got up from behind the counter, then slowly came to the main door where he flipped the sign to the \u201copen\u201d side against the window glass.\u2026\u2026Near the Crossroad, inside the dilapidated and abandoned factory, guardians of the church had already pulled up a blockade around the area when Inquisitor Vanna arrived with her blessed sword strapped to the waist. She\u2019s being accompanied by two storm priests as they descend the stairs to the basement floor.Here, everything remained the same after they received a report and discovered the rally, which was promptly cordoned off until now.In the huge basement, the disgusting smell of blood was particularly thick. Mix this smell with the pungent sting of burning chemicals and decapitated parts of the dead strewn along the floor, such a scene would terrify even the strongest of hearts. However, the female inquisitor wasn\u2019t one of those weak souls. She\u2019s focused and frowning because there\u2019s no traces or clues of the attackers here.It was a one-sided crushing battle. The assailants far outweighed these cultists, who were basically ordinary folks. Also, the attack appears to be sudden and abrupt with many of the cultists unable to resist or react in time.Who is responsible?Wild transcendents with whom these cultists have a personal feud?Or another powerful heresy order?Perhaps some kind of out-of-control bloody sacrifice that has gone berserk?The young inquisitor was lost in thought.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 87": "Chapter 87 \u201cVanna\u2019s Investigation\u201dThis Translation is hosted on https://bcatranslation.com/Only the cultists\u2019 bodies were left in the rally, and no evidence could be found to prove the attackers\u2019 identity, making the investigation very difficult.But one thing\u2019s certain, it was definitely not ordinary people who carried out this attack based upon the pungent and peculiar smell remaining in the air \u2013 it\u2019s the trace of the flames that had been contaminated.Vanna carefully examined the oil lamps left in the basement. Beside her, a priest had taken out special powders and potions from the kit to analyze the lamps for residues that should not appear in the real world.Fire had always been the most remarkable thing in this world.It\u2019s the visible order, the handwriting of the gods when they make contact with the world, the evidence that \u201ccivilization still exists\u201d. When the flame burns, everything changes and leaves its mark.Therefore, if there has been a supernatural-level battle here, the flames should carry some corresponding traces left in there.After the priest began to get busy, Vanna returned to the middle of the basement to examine the corpse of a sun heretic who had fallen there.\u201cNearly every bone in the body has been broken as if they had been directly hit by a raging bison. It\u2019s hard to imagine what kind of weapon could have caused such a result,\u201d a coroner said next to her.\u201cBlunt force strike\u2026 A brute force that could break dozens of bones at once?\u201d Vanna frowned slightly, \u201cWhat is it? A hammer with a diameter of one meter?\u201dThe coroner shook his head: \u201cUnlikely\u2026 Compared to these, the ashes over there at the end are more suspicious.\u201dVanna came to the end of the basement and saw the \u201cashes\u201d mentioned by the other person.There is a complete set of clothes scattered on the floor, and the grayish-black ashes scattered between the clothes indicate this should\u2019ve been a person before they died.\u201cThere is no doubt that it is some kind of supernatural power at work. Judging from the traces, it may be a kind of abnormal flame,\u201d Vanna judged based on the quick assessment. Then turning back to the coroner behind herself, \u201cIt is difficult for a normal flame to turn someone into ashes while preserving the person\u2019s clothes.\u201d\u201cThe wall shows signs of impact, and this cultist seems to have been hit by a huge force as well before being burned by the flames,\u201d said another cleric at the scene. \u201cThis cultist was the only one in the whole scene that shows visible signs of being killed by supernatural forces and a power we have never seen before.\u201d\u201cIn addition, we have also found a spot in the corner that has been seriously corroded by an unknown element. Unfortunately, we did not find any residual physical substance that might point us to its origin. Perhaps it\u2019s also the effect of a supernatural power.\u201d\u201cIt could be a spell cast by a person, or it could be an anomaly,\u201d Vanna said casually, \u201cWas this discovered by the citizen\u2019s report?\u201d\u201cYes, an enthusiastic citizen heard the strange noises in the abandoned factory and reported it to the officers and guardians nearby. They were in the middle of exchanging shifts for the night.\u201d The priest beside her nodded, \u201cThese cultists are very cautious. They erased the traces of their activities after entering the city-state and successfully lurked in the lower city. If it were not for this attack, they would probably be able to continue without our detection.\u201d\u201cIt only means that there are more dens like this hidden in the shadows,\u201d Vanna comments in a heavy voice. \u201cThe gutters and alleys of the lower city are the focus of investigation this time\u2026\u201dJust as she was halfway through her words, a guardian suddenly barged over from the side, holding something in his hand: \u201cInquisitor, look at this!\u201dVanna immediately looked up and saw the guardian holding a small tray containing several slightly deformed copper bullets.\u201cWe found two revolvers that had been fired at the scene. These bullets should be from those guns,\u201d the guardian reports. \u201cAnd the blood on the bullets is most likely from the attacker!\u201dVanna\u2019s eyes fell on those bullets and confirmed her peer\u2019s assessment. The tip was all deformed and contracted\u2026 but unlikely the result of hitting flesh less each of these bullets landed on bone.Such precision would be difficult\u2026.On top of that, how did these bullets, which had clearly hit their target, get left behind on the scene?Vanna thought carefully and came up with two possibilities: either the attacker operated on himself to remove the bullets before departing, or the attacker had a special physical ability to \u201cdrain\u201d the bullet out of the body by relying on their muscles.Whatever the possibility, one thing was obvious. This powerful assailant took out all the cultists here without delay despite being shot several times, then calmly removed the bullets after the incident.Vanna looked down at her own hands at the thought. She could do something similar like that, but it\u2019s precisely because she could that she knows how difficult it would be for mortal flesh.\u201cThe one who killed these cultists should be a physically strengthened transcendent, and the weapon used is some kind of large blunt weapon,\u201d Vanna turned her head and said to a retinue. \u201cThe other side has rich combat experience, is strong-willed, and is extremely powerful. Considering the weapons used, the figure should also be very tall and a master of the flame. From preliminary judgment, the perpetrator is hostile towards the sun heretic. For the time being, we cannot determine whether they are on our side or not\u2026\u201d\u201cInform all guardians and policemen at all levels to pay attention to those who meet the above characteristics. If a suspected target is found, give priority to reporting. Do not act rashly until contact is made with the main supervisors.\u201dThe guardian who served as the retinue immediately lowered his head: \u201cYes, Inquisitor.\u201dVanna exhaled softly, then sketched in her mind what the attackers at the scene of the rally might look like: a two-meter-tall man wielding a giant mace or hammer. The person is calm and fluent in martial arts and can summon a flame to do their bidding.That\u2019s pretty much how it should be.\u2026\u2026Back inside the antique shop.Duncan had just sent off the second client with a smile on his face after opening this morning. The client was a rather chubby lady who appeared pleased by her purchase since she was a regular of the shop. Today, she had taken a fancy to a pair of vases intended for the new neighbor.Obviously, the vase was not an authentic antique but an import from the wholesale market with a manufacturing date of last week.After throwing a few crumpled bills into the drawer, Duncan sat back behind the counter, feeling a little calmer in his impetuous mood.At least for now, opening this antique shop was a fun novelty for him. The profit of six coins could hardly be enough to satiate Duncan\u2019s appetite. It\u2019s better to stick with reporting cultists and reaping the bounty afterward.Duncan divided his energy and paid attention to the situation on Ai\u2019s side then. The bird had arrived at the fourth block; unfortunately, no reaction had come from the sun talisman thus far.Of course, this was to be expected. Although many cultists are pouring into the city-state of Pland, they are not to the extent that they could bloom everywhere. Besides, the job was not easy by nature.Hunting requires patience.Duncan leisurely enjoyed this quiet time, dividing his energy to pay attention to the movements of the dove while occasionally shifting to the situation on the Vanished. He would also control his main body on the ship and walk around while watching Alice fiddle with the items aboard. Such a life wasn\u2019t so bad if he looked at things positively.At this moment, a crisp and pleasant sound of bells suddenly came from the direction of the doorway, interrupting his cranky thoughts under his leisure.\u201cWelcome,\u201d Duncan said casually as he looked up at the door, where an old gentleman with gray hair had entered.It was a well-dressed old gentleman with a new and neat dark brown coat, polished leather shoes on his feet, a black cane of unknown material in his hand, and a meticulous bowtie.It\u2019s not like the wardrobe of someone that would appear in the lower city, but more like the folks up at the Crossroad where the middle class would attend.Duncan had no idea about the so-called \u201cdecent people\u201d of this world, but he could tell at a glance that this old gentleman was not an ordinary customer.\u201cDo you have something fancy in mind?\u201d He laughed like a real antique store manager. \u201cTake what fate befalls you.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 88": "Chapter 88 \u201cThere Is 1 genuine Item\u201dThis Translation is hosted on https://bcatranslation.com/The old gentleman curiously glanced around after entering and took the environment in: old furnishings, murky windows, and cheap shelves with random \u201cantiques\u201d strewn randomly along the cabinets, the perfect representation of what this business dealt with.Likely aside from the money collected thus far, there\u2019s nothing but fakes in the whole store!But even so, the old gentleman, who was dressed well for the lower city, remained interested in what he saw. That was until Duncan\u2019s voice came from the direction of the counter and interrupted his thoughts.\u201cA humorous way of selling,\u201d the old gentleman chuckles, \u201cto take away what one is destined for\u2026 ignoring the items involved, that\u2019s a beautiful phrase in itself.\u201d\u201cActually, fate and destiny aside, you must also have money.\u201d Duncan smiled back, \u201cFortunately, the things here are not expensive. Do you want anything?\u201d\u201cEh\u2026 I\u2019m not here to buy anything,\u201d the old gentleman sounded hesitant, \u201cactually\u2026\u201dDue to this opening, Duncan had cut in and played salesman: \u201cOne doesn\u2019t have to buy. Just having a look is good too. Anything that catches your eye?\u201dThe old man\u2019s face couldn\u2019t help but show a trace of helplessness: \u201cThis\u2026 everything here are counterfeits.\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Duncan said with a reasonable look, \u201cwhy would anything here be real? I don\u2019t even have security in place for the store. That\u2019s so the thieves would lose more than they gain by robbing me.\u201dThe old man\u2019s cheeks noticeably twitched over that explanation. He probably didn\u2019t expect that the antique store\u2019s owner could have such a calm attitude when saying something so blunt. After choking for several seconds: \u201cThat\u2026\u201d\u201cThose that are good at persuading themselves will take this as an antique shop and get a pleasurable experience. Those that can\u2019t will take it as a grocery store to look for good deals. Unless you\u2019re good at deceiving yourself, who would honestly believe they\u2019ve found a gold brick inside a garbage heap? Look at that bowl over there. For a simple few coins, you can enjoy a moment of pleasure that only those with immense wealth can experience. What\u2019s there to complain about? The bowl? That\u2019s the crystallization of our modern industry, you know.\u201dThe old man listened to Duncan\u2019s crooked reasoning and found himself too stunned to respond. For the longest time, he kept looking back and forth from the man and bowl until he broke out into a chuckle again. Then his sight noticed something shining next to the counter, which caused his expression to freeze and turn serious.Duncan was seriously immersed in the pleasure of doing business when he noticed the change in the old man\u2019s expression. But before the shop owner could react, the old man had already stretched the hand over and grabbed onto something.\u201cThis thing\u2026\u201d The old gentleman had pulled out a well-preserved dagger in the middle of a debris pile.It was an old item from the Vanished that Duncan had hidden here\u2014one of only two genuine items in the entire antique shop.The other was the cast iron cannonball placed deeper in the pile of debris.Duncan wanted to divert the old man\u2019s attention at first, but then he noticed the light coming from the fella\u2019s eyes. It\u2019s the look of a professional who found something worthy of their time.Duncan frowned at the thought and eyed the dagger with a perplexed gazeIt\u2019s actually not a big deal if he sold the dagger. It\u2019s not a supernatural item like some of the other things aboard the Vanished, nor does it corrupt those who use it. In essence, the dagger was no different from the bowl he just mentioned.\u201cThis thing\u2026\u201d repeated the old gentleman, who had raised his head to meet Duncan\u2019s face, \u201cIs it also a \u2018good\u2019 in the store?\u201dThis gentleman said that very tactfully, but the implication was quite obvious: Why is there a real thing in your pile of trash? A mistake on the job or what?If Duncan couldn\u2019t figure out this old gent was a person of a specialized profession then it would be him that\u2019s a fool by this point. Retracting his smile, the crummy shop owner puts on an air of mystique: \u201cSee, didn\u2019t I say you might find something you are fated to have?\u201dThen he cleared his throat and got serious: \u201cMost goods in the store are discounted, except for a few, such as this one in your hand.\u201dThe old gentleman immediately glanced back at the shelves and confirmed the majority of the items were in fact products of modern society. The prices are marked in the hundreds of thousands like some real antique, but after the discount by the cross with a marker, it\u2019s only a few coins. This caused the new customer to become increasingly more amused and interested in this seemingly dilapidated antique shop.However, before the old gent could ask for the price of this dagger, the bell hanging from the doorway rang again.Duncan looked up and saw Nina\u2019s figure.\u201cUncle Duncan I\u2019m back!\u201d Nina didn\u2019t raise her head when she entered and shouted like its common practice, \u201cHas Mr. Morris arrived yet?\u201d\u201cNot that I\u2019m aware of,\u201d Duncan glanced inside the store, \u201cI\u2019m entertaining\u2026\u201dBefore he could speak, he saw the old gentleman in front of him coughing dryly to interrupt, \u201cMy name is Morris.\u201dDuncan: \u201c\u2026..?\u201d\u201cMr. Morris!\u201d Nina immediately exclaimed in surprise after noticing her teacher\u2019s presence. Then like every student who bumped into their teacher after school, she became visibly antsy and straightened her back, \u201cGood afternoon!\u201dDuncan looked at Nina, then back at the old man in front of himself, then repeated that gesture three more times before going haywire.\u201cI had wanted to introduce myself from the beginning,\u201d the old man spread his hands helplessly, \u201cyou kept interrupting me so I wasn\u2019t able to.\u201dNina had come back to her senses then and promptly noticed the dagger in her teacher\u2019s grasp. Hurrying forward: \u201cTeacher, don\u2019t buy it! Everything in our store are fakes!\u201dDuncan shot a weird look at his niece, complaining how overly honest she must be inside to oust her own uncle in a situation like this. Although with the level of knowledge this history teacher has, Mr. Morris would likely be able to figure out that much out on his own regardless of the young lady\u2019s warning or not.On the other side, Mr. Morris shook his head after hearing Nina\u2019s warning, then raised his hand to place the dagger on the counter: \u201cThis one is real.\u201dNina was stunned: \u201c\u2026 Ahhhh?\u201d\u201cThis dagger most likely came from a century ago, and it was one of the favorite tools of seafarers in the city-states of Pland and Lansa at the time. But due to the bankruptcy of the central forge and the vulnerability of the items at sea, few remain in existence today. The ones that did survive are in very bad condition\u2026.\u201d Morris said while carefully picking up the dagger and drawing the blade from the scabbard. \u201cI\u2026 I\u2019ve never seen one so well preserved. It almost looks like it was still in use not long ago. The blade is sharp and glistening with light. I can\u2019t find a single flaw in the blade\u2019s body\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt also has an original scabbard too,\u201d Duncan added. \u201cIf you look closely, you\u2019ll see that it even has an original buckle on the back of the scabbard.\u201dWhen Morris heard this, he quickly examined the scabbard and accessories attached to it. The surprise in his eyes couldn\u2019t be ignored because it was literally beaming: \u201cThis\u2026 I really didn\u2019t notice just now\u2026 Oh, heavens! It\u2019s like this had just come off of a sailor yesterday! If I weren\u2019t so confident in my own knowledge, I would suspect this is an amazing imitation\u2026. But it even has the flawed patterns at the handle\u2026\u201dSpeaking of this, he suddenly began to doubt himself: \u201cIs it really not an imitation?\u201dUpon hearing this, Nina quickly waved her hand: \u201cUncle can\u2019t imitate something this real\u2026.\u201dDuncan twitched from the corner of his eye while watching his niece: \u201cGo upstairs and do your homework!\u201dNina was stunned for a moment: \u201cI don\u2019t have homework today\u2026\u201d\u201cThen read a book!\u201dNina stuck out her tongue and walked towards the stairs in small steps, but then glanced back at her teacher before going up the rails: \u201cMr. Morris, don\u2019t forget that you are here to visit\u2026\u201d\u201cOf course, I have a lot to talk with Mr. Duncan,\u201d Morris radiated a smile, \u201cyou go upstairs and read first. Don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t snitch on my own student.\u201dNina shot both men a suspicious look like she did not believe either of them but then knew better than to die on this hill.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 89": "Chapter 89 \u201cNina\u2019s Abnormality\u201dThis Translation is hosted on https://bcatranslation.com/Duncan scratched the back of his head in confusion as Nina briskly ran up the stairs while giggling: \u201cWhat is this kid so happy for\u2026\u201dThen he heard Mr. Morris\u2019 voice coming from the counter: \u201cHonestly, you are very different from what I had in mind, Mr. Duncan.\u201d\u201cBig difference?\u201d Duncan raised one eyebrow, \u201cWhat is your impression of me?\u201dAs he spoke, he walked around from behind the counter and flipped the open sign at the door to closed. Then moving a chair over, he gestures for the guest to take a seat since it\u2019s improper to leave the teacher standing for a family visit.\u201cThank you,\u201d Morris nodded in thanks. After sitting down, the old gent looked in Duncan\u2019s direction with a gentle and elegant smile, \u201cWe haven\u2019t met before, but I\u2019ve heard about you from other sources\u2026 About Nina\u2019s family situation. Forgive me for being rude, but as far as I\u2019ve heard, Nina has an alcoholic uncle who is addicted to gambling and has a hot temper. Everyone tells me she\u2019s living in a dysfunctional home. As a result, Nina doesn\u2019t have any friends at school, nor do the other students want to deal with her.\u201dDuncan was brewing some coffee on the side when his hands froze over Morris\u2019s last sentence. Then realizing he was acting out of character, the store owner unhurriedly completed the word and returned to the counter with two cups of coffee, one offered to the old teacher. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t have the bargain stuff here. The best coffee in the lower city is all like this.\u201dHe sat down opposite the old man with the dagger acting as the dividing line between the two.\u201cStrictly speaking\u2026 these rumors are true,\u201d Duncan said slowly. \u201cI had an illness previously, alright, a rather severe illness. I relied on strong spirits to numb my nerves when the painkillers didn\u2019t work. It was during that period that I fell into decadence. It appears my condition has affected Nina\u2019s adolescence life more than I previously thought.\u201dMorris carefully observed Duncan for a long time before he spoke thoughtfully, \u201cIs that so? But I don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re someone who has just come out of decadence. More like a gentleman who has never fallen into decadence to begin with. And your wit, your humor, it\u2019s not like that of someone who\u2019s been influenced by alcohol.\u201dSpeaking of this, he took a sip from the cup without making any evaluation of the coffee but rather on Duncan himself: \u201cI believe I\u2019m a good evaluation of others in this regard.\u201d\u201cMaybe it\u2019s just that I\u2019m adjusting my mindset relatively quickly,\u201d Duncan laughed, his tone extraordinarily calm. He had to admit that this old man did see people accurately, but he did not believe a local historian could see through to his secret. \u201cNina is almost an adult, and I am her only guardian. I have to show some responsibility at some point.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 Regardless, that\u2019s a good thing for that kid if that\u2019s your view.\u201d Morris gave Duncan a deep look, \u201cShe\u2019s in a critical stage of her studies. While many say that they can only go to the factory to tighten bolts after graduating from the public schools, I disagree. Knowledge in itself is a valuable asset, and when it shows its light at some point in one\u2019s life, it will be astronomical to their success.\u201dThe old man said, shaking his head: \u201cUnfortunately, most of the parents I have dealt with do not agree with this notion. Their attention is always on having their children graduate as soon as possible and finding a job afterward.\u201dRegarding this topic, Duncan almost got a type of familiar kinship: like any teacher, Duncan also had his fair share of saying similar things to the parents of his students back on Earth.But soon, he retracted this kinship mentality and shook his head slightly after remembering the living conditions of this world. \u201cBecause this is the lower city, Mr. Morris. Your view is indeed wise and visionary, but most people here will only worry about the ability to pay next month\u2019s bill. You can\u2019t ask folks to have long-term visions under such conditions.\u201d\u201cIndeed, many people are limited by the great difficulties of life.\u201d The old teacher sighed like he was pained by the situation, \u201cSorry for soaking up your time like this. I\u2019m sure you have your own woes as well\u2026. However, my worries appear unnecessary after getting to know you.\u201d\u201cWorries?\u201d Duncan frowned, \u201cDid something happen to Nina at school recently? Have her grades regressed?\u201d\u201cHer grades have always been good, but lately\u2026 She\u2019s been distracted.\u201d Morris weighed her vocabulary to not cause panic, \u201cShe tends to mentally wander off in class and sleep during the study sessions. Then in the previous chemistry class last week, she accidentally set a lab table on fire. This has never happened before\u2026 at least never with her.\u201dSpeaking of this, the old teacher paused and added: \u201cHer grades for the first two terms did not drop by much, but if she continues in this state, it will be difficult to say if she will graduate with honors. I agree that options are limited to those graduating from the public school system. However, assembling machines in the lower city factories and maintaining the steam cores at the churches of the upper city are totally different things. As Nina\u2019s guardian, I ask that you pay closer attention to her studies.\u201d\u201cNina has been distracted from class lately?\u201d Duncan frowned, \u201cShe didn\u2019t tell me about it\u2026\u201d\u201cA girl of this age certainly won\u2019t tell you much,\u201d Morris shook his head. \u201cI thought at first that something bad must\u2019ve happened at home, or something her \u2018alcoholic uncle\u2019 had done recently that affected her mental state. But now, it appears the reason is entirely different.\u201dDuncan didn\u2019t speak for a while, only trying to recall if there\u2019s any abnormality in the child\u2019s behavior in the past couple of days.Then before he could get anywhere, Morris\u2019s voice came again: \u201cYou know her best. Has anything abnormal happened to Nina recently? Such as not resting well, or her health deteriorating?\u201dDuncan pondered for a long time to only spread his hands out: \u201c\u2026 To my shame, I can\u2019t think of an answer.\u201dHe couldn\u2019t figure out the answer because he hadn\u2019t even known Nina for a week ago! How would he know what changes occurred recently?Morris didn\u2019t seem too surprised by Duncan\u2019s answer, probably because he had lowered his expectations for \u201cNina\u2019s uncle\u201d according to anecdotal rumors before he arrived. Speaking habitually: \u201cYou should pay more attention to her, especially for girls this age, material support alone is not enough.\u201dAs soon as Duncan heard this, a thought suddenly appeared in his mind: \u201cCould she be in love?\u201dFrankly speaking, this idea was more or less based on \u201cZhou Ming\u2019s\u201d experience as a people\u2019s teacher\u2026Morris showed a somewhat strange expression after hearing this with an even weirder look in those eyes: \u201cIt\u2019s an all-girls school\u2026.\u201dDuncan thought about it and looked serious: \u201cGirls\u2019 school is also possible.\u201dMorris\u2019s eyes widened slightly.This old gentleman, who has always been fascinated by academics, was shocked!\u201cOomph, don\u2019t mind me, I\u2019m just speaking hypothetically,\u201d Duncan knew as soon as he saw the old man\u2019s reaction that this topic might be a little over-the-top. Quickly moving on to avoid this embarrassing situation, \u201cI\u2019ll talk to Nina properly\u2026 she should be willing to tell me.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Oh, of course,\u201d the old gentleman finally came back to his senses due to the shock. \u201cAs far as I understand\u2026 Nina is a very good and honest child. If you talk with her, I\u2019m sure she wouldn\u2019t resist too much.\u201dDuncan nodded: \u201cIs there anything else that I should be aware of?\u201d\u201cAside from being distracted, there\u2019s nothing else that I\u2019m aware of,\u201d the old man thought about it and shook his head. \u201cI actually came today mainly to talk about this matter and to learn of her real family situation\u2026. Speaking of this, Nina\u2019s parents are\u2026\u201d\u201cEleven years ago,\u201d Duncan said, \u201cthe official record of the incident was a leak at a chemical plant in the sixth block.\u201d\u201cI see,\u201d the old gentleman sighed, \u201cI remember the accident as well. Back then, my daughter and I happened to be at the Crossroad when the commotion started. It caused quite a stampede of fleeing bystanders due to the chemical leak. Afterwards, the investigation also said that many cultists took the opportunity to rampage across the lower city that night\u2026.\u201dDuncan\u2019s heart jumped at this. Then forcing himself to act calm and casual: \u201cWas there a fire in the lower city that night?\u201d\u201cFire? I don\u2019t remember any fire,\u201d Morris frowned, \u201cI believe you must\u2019ve been mistaken.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 Looks like I\u2019m misremembered,\u201d Duncan said with a smile and pressed his temple, \u201cI really should stay away from alcohol.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 90": "Chapter 90 \u201cThe Antique Shop\u2019s First Big Sale\u201dThis Translation is hosted on https://bcatranslation.com/Duncan had expected Morris\u2019s reaction. The reason he asked was only to confirm the question.As he had previously known, ordinary people like Morris had no idea that a fire existed \u2013 the only ones who knew were Nina and his own memory. Or, strictly speaking, until he took charge of this body.The topic was quickly skipped over with no further questions from Mr. Morris. Afterward, the two continued to talk about various subjects regarding Nina\u2019s studies and how she was doing in class.Through the conversation, it could be seen that the old gentleman cared a lot about his students, but due to Nina\u2019s uncle\u2019s previous depraved lifestyle, the meeting got postponed to this day.And when the \u201cbusiness\u201d of today\u2019s visit finally got finished, Mr. Morris\u2019s attention unsurprisingly fell on his second concern.The old man eyed the well-preserved antique dagger on the counter, and the eagerness in his eyes could be seen by anyone: \u201cThis thing\u2026 do you want to sell it?\u201dDuncan immediately smiled: \u201cThis is an antique shop.\u201dAntiques in an antique shop are of course meant to be sold.He\u2019s thought it through. Although this dagger came from the Vanished, but if you think about it, there seems to be no hidden danger in selling it. There are many things on that ghost ship, and not all of them are related to the supernatural \u2013 like this dagger for example. If thrown elsewhere, it was just an ordinary antique\u2026 So why couldn\u2019t he sell it?Compared with the pile of fakes in the store, the warehouse on the Vanished was a good means to get money!As soon as his train of thought smoothed out, Duncan suddenly found the world growing wider. Then he realized something incredible \u2013 he was actually sitting on a treasure trove! Those things regarded as garbage on the Vanished, like chipped copper coins, or iron scrap metals tossed in a corner, are all treasures in the eyes of these historians!Morris didn\u2019t know what scheming thoughts were turning in the head of the antique shop owner. His attention was all on the well-preserved dagger in front of him at this time. After a long period of hesitation, the old gent cautiously spoke: \u201cHow much?\u201dDuncan: \u201c\u2026\u201dHeaven and earth just became narrow again. Why? Because he did not know how much to set.Even if he inherited the memory of this body in its entirety, he still wouldn\u2019t know what price to set for this antique. This store had never sold a single real thing since its opening.Without question, he first ruled out the option of charging two or three thousand solas. Even if the dagger were real and exceptional, it\u2019s no more than a hundred years old according to the details Morris revealed. Besides, it\u2019s not like the dagger was unique. There are others out there, albeit in a worse condition, but it\u2019s still out there.Secondly, Morris was Nina\u2019s history teacher. If he butchers him up knowing how fond the old gent was of the dagger, it would inevitably leave a bad impression for the girl. Earning a small profit at the price of ruining the niece\u2019s image before the teacher was stupid. Any parent would know better than to test that theory.Eventually, Duncan could only shake his head and smile. He\u2019s given up and decides to toss the problem over: \u201cYou make an offer Mr. Morris. You are Nina\u2019s most respected teacher, and I really can\u2019t make a price like I would for an ordinary customer.\u201dMorris pondered the issue seriously, but not for long though.\u201cThree thousand\u2026 Three thousand and four hundred solas, this is my estimate,\u201d Morris finally spoke. He seemed to have considered the number a little before settling on it, \u201cMr. Duncan, you may think that the price is too low, but take into account the age of the dagger and its historical positioning\u2026 This kind of non-unique collection is very discounted in the market. Of course, it\u2019s condition is exceptionally good, which is rare, but not all collectors are interested in this\u2026\u201dThe old gentleman seemed to be trying to explain his reasoning for this number, and Duncan listened intently as well.In the lower city, the total expenses of the average family of three in a month are around two to three hundred solas. That\u2019s under the premise they wouldn\u2019t have any leftovers, and the savings would be very little even if they did. Therefore, the dagger was almost equivalent to a family\u2019s income for one and a half years!Duncan honestly didn\u2019t know if he should lament on how an antique shop could hit it so big in one day, or if he should lament the striking gap of buying power between the ordinary people and those living in the upper city.Or perhaps he should sigh at how rich this old gent was\u2026.\u201cDeal,\u201d he exhaled softly and said to the old man with a smile.There\u2019s no need to haggle and waste time for them both.In any case, this was a lot of money for Nina and him now\u2014even more than the bounties of reporting those cultists.Not long ago, he was still thinking about the way to make money, but now he found that this matter seemed to be less urgent.The world sure was impermanent.Contrary to the shop owner\u2019s frank attitude, Morris on the other hand felt that Duncan had agreed to the deal too easily. He even felt apologetic for not going higher. \u201cActually\u2026 You are taking a loss at this price. By normal estimate, the dagger should fetch another ten or twenty percent\u2026. But\u2026.\u201dThe old man scratched his nose and seemed to be a little embarrassed: \u201cI spent a bit too much on collecting in recent days, so my hands are a bit tight on money right now\u2026.\u201dThe old gentleman was even more candid than Duncan imagined.\u201cI think it\u2019s a good price, and the difference in the middle should be because of fate,\u201d Duncan says with a smile, and then as if suddenly remembering something, he got up and walked behind the counter. \u201cBy the way, I have a giveaway to celebrate this big sale.\u201dMorris watched curiously at the shop owner until he saw the small amethyst pendant being pulled out from a small compartment behind the counter.The old man\u2019s eyes were sharp, and he immediately noticed the label of a certain glass workshop on the item, which hadn\u2019t been removed yet.Morris: \u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cA pendant with a calming effect. The crystal has been blessed with the guiding light of dispelling curses and illusions. Ancient hypnotists used this to protect their spirits from the dangers lurking in the dream world.\u201d Duncan pushed the pendant over with a serious expression, \u201cIt has protected generations of owners in the past, and now it is yours by fate\u2026.\u201dMorris hesitantly pointed to the label: \u201cBut it says that it is produced by Johnny Glass Workshop\u2026\u201d\u201cI know, I forgot to take it off,\u201d Duncan peeled off the label with an expressionless face, \u201cthis is a giveaway. There\u2019s no way I would have so many real antiques in this shop to giveaway, right?\u201dMorris was stunned for a moment, then he couldn\u2019t help but laugh: \u201cHa, you\u2019re right on that point. Thank you very much for the \u2018giveaway\u2019. With this thing\u2026 I hope my daughter will nag me less.\u201dHe said as he accepted the pendant, and then touched fiddled with his pocket and pulled out a checkbook: \u201cI didn\u2019t bring as much cash with me when I came out. This cheque can be cashed at the local branch at the Crossroad. Is this alright with you?\u201dDuncan smiled: \u201cOf course.\u201dAs he said this, his gaze fell on Morris\u2019s booklet.He\u2019s already had his doubts about this history teacher when Nina mentioned the guy, and now, that doubt grew even bigger.Whether in terms of the wardrobe or daily words used during their conversation, the old gent was clearly not ordinary. He\u2019s too sophisticated, a characteristic trait not commonly found even in the upper city. A scholar of that caliber could easily get a job at the only university in this city.Even if other factors are not considered, there\u2019s also another obvious problem: can an ordinary public school teacher so casually spend a person\u2019s annual income in one a single purchase?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 91": "Chapter 91 \u201cChaotic History\u201dThis Translation is hosted on https://bcatranslation.com/Duncan decides to get direct since he doesn\u2019t want to beat around the bush after they\u2019ve hit it off. Of course, the wording left a lot of wiggle room to avoid being dishonest and rude.\u201cActually, I\u2019m a little curious about how a scholar like you would stay in the public school at the Crossroad? With your talent, I\u2019m sure plenty of other jobs would love to hire you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 You\u2019re not the first to ask that,\u201d Morris seemed to have long been accustomed to the questions of others in this regard. \u201cActually, it\u2019s nothing special. I\u2019m old and tired, and there are plenty of youngsters who could better use the few resources at hand. Instead of competing with the new generation, I rather spend my remaining years helping to raise the young.\u201dThe old man\u2019s explanation was probable but not entirely the truth. Duncan could tell so he didn\u2019t press for more since that would be rude. \u201cBut I heard Nina say her classmates don\u2019t pay much attention in her classes. Isn\u2019t the knowledge of the ancient kingdom of Crete a bit too far back for the average folks?\u201d\u201cEven in the deepest and darkest gutters, as long as the spiritual mind is still thinking, \u2018history\u2019 will always be valuable,\u201d Morris shook his head in disapproval. \u201cIt is with the history of the past thousand years that we have been able to get to where we are today.\u201d\u201cOf course, Mr. Duncan, you\u2019re right that very few people in these parts will want to listen to my tirade\u2026 But even if I can only teach one student who will listen, then I will feel like my efforts are not in vain.\u201dMorris said unhurriedly and then seemed to realize he had gone on a tangent. Forming an apologetic smile: \u201cSorry, professional habits, I\u2019ve started preaching again.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I think it\u2019s a valuable \u2018preaching\u2019 experience,\u201d Duncan waved his hand immediately, \u201cand it\u2019s been a pleasure to talk to you. I\u2019m an antique dealer, and you\u2019re a history expert. So from a certain perspective, we\u2019re peers of the same industry.\u201dI\u2019m also a teacher on Earth\u2026.\u201cSeriously, if from the impression of walking into this antique shop only\u2026 I would really question the part of us being peers,\u201d Morris spread his hands, \u201cbut now I kind of believe it. You at least have one real thing in here.\u201dDuncan\u2019s face was very calm, but his heart was already shouting he had more than just one product. In fact, the pirate captain had already drawn out the warehouse plans for the eighth franchising branch!Continuing to maintain a smile and indifferent posture: \u201cI heard Nina say that you are actually better at ancient history, especially the history before and after the ancient kingdom of Crete?\u201d\u201cStrictly speaking, there is only after, no before,\u201d Morris immediately corrected. \u201cThe ancient kingdom of Crete is the beginning of civilization in the Deep Sea Age, and before the Old Kingdom was the Great Annihilation, which was the melting point of civilization. No one can say what the world was like before that point in time because all we have to go on are contradictory texts circulating in the wilderness.\u201dDuncan mused: \u201cThe spark breaker of civilization\u2026 Is like a \u2018horizon limit\u2019 that runs through the river of history\u2026\u201d\u201cHorizon limit?\u201d Morris apparently heard the word for the first time and became perplexed by the metaphor.\u201cA concept. If you put it on the \u2018Great Annihilation\u2019 event, you can think of it as an invisible wall of time. All the information on one side of the wall cannot be transmitted to the other side of the wall, whether it is an optical observation or the causal connection of things, all of it is cut off in front of that boundary with no means to understand the other side.\u201d\u201cQuite an interesting concept!\u201d Old Mr. Morris\u2019s eyes widened in astonishment, \u201cCrossing the limit of the horizon in history\u2026 A wall of time\u2026 Indeed, a very apt statement! Mr. Duncan, forgive me for my initial contemptuous impression of you\u2026. You are more professional than I could\u2019ve ever imagined. Are you also a study of the ancient records?\u201d\u201cNo, I have to say I\u2019m not affluent with the ancient records. I\u2019m merely more flexible in terms of my thought pattern. Sometimes I would conjure up some wonderful metaphors like now,\u201d Duncan modestly explains, knowing he should act ignorant in times like these. \u201cBut I do have questions about what happened during the Great Annihilation event\u2026 You just mentioned that the history before then is usually not recognized by scholars? That there are many contradictory records in the \u2018wild\u2019? What do these records look like?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just some wild stories passed down through the ages\u2026 But I did study some.\u201d Morris pondered what he should say before going slowly, \u201cFor example, the city-state of Pland has a record of a manuscript from the year 1069 of the new era. The original is lost so we can\u2019t prove if it\u2019s true, but the manuscripts do describe the following before the Great Annihilation:\u201cThe world is a sphere, floating in the vast sea of stars. There are countless celestial bodies dotting the night sky with three moons circling the world. Humans occupied three continents, one of which is frozen year-round. To combat the harsh environment, the people built a device called the \u2018dome\u2019 to envelop the entire continent. The dome provides warmth, provides light, provides the eternal spring fueled by the seawater\u2026.\u201dMorris paused after saying this, then gave some thought to the reaction from Duncan. Once the old scholar felt like it was okay, he continued:On an island near Cold Harbor, explorers found a record carved into a slab of rock, which also described the world before the Great Annihilation. Scholars eventually cracked the old wording, but the information left everyone puzzled.\u201cThe slate describes a homeland called the \u2018home star\u2019. Due to the world drying up, the people of the world boarded a ship called the \u2018Abinix\u2019, which can cross the sea of stars using the fuel and gas it captured from the stars. The journey lasted more than 47,000 days and nights until it was suddenly swept up by a huge vortex. The ship disintegrated under the force, and its descendants somehow survived by relying on the sea.\u201d\u201cOf course, these records are not as bizarre as the legends left by the elves of Wind Harbor.\u201cElves have a thousand-year lifespan, and their history should be the most detailed and reliable among all the short-lived races. But for some reason, their history is the most fragmented and bizarre of all the known texts. Many of their files have even been twisted into unreadable lost contexts, which were forcibly sealed due to the pollution they carried. Nowadays, the only information we have to go upon are oral poems narrated by the elves.\u201cThe world is a dream, a dream created by the great demon god Sasroka. Then one day, the demon god suddenly dreamt of a flood sweeping across the world. In his panic, Sasroka awoke from his dream and leaked the dream into reality. The elves were swept away from reality due to the flood\u2026. As result of the tragedy, the elves could never return to their peaceful homeland and has settled down in the Deep Sea Era after the flooding.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 92": "Chapter 92 \u201cEndless Guesses\u201dThis Translation is hosted on https://bcatranslation.com/Morris sighed. \u201cWhen those of us who dig into history and spend our lives researching the world\u2019s mysteries, we would always be stumped by the wall of the unknown.\u201dThe old man had a thick layer of exhausted frustration on his face as if he had travelled for most of his life doing exactly what his peers had done to no success.\u201cThe history before the Great Annihilation is fragmented and contradictory, and the records between each city-state are like bizarre stories with no connection\u2026. Because of that, nobody can conclusively say which is the truth.\u201dDuncan did not speak for a while and went mute. Unlike the old man\u2019s sighing mood, he, on the other hand, just went through a baptism storm.As a \u201cforeigner\u201d who has experienced the information age of modern Earth, he could already guess what those things are in the wild histories.The dome covering the entire continent may likely be an artificial ecological device to replicate a desirable environment for its residences. As for the seawater fuel segment in the story, probably some sort of hydro-fusion engine to run the machinery.Now for the giant ships sailing across the stars, that\u2019s even easier to figure out. They\u2019re likely a group of colonization starships that occasionally stops at a star system to extract gas and alloys from the planets to sustain its supplies.Now that leaves the elvish tale of the demon god and dream world\u2026 From dreams to the sea taking over reality\u2026 Duncan couldn\u2019t figure out what this was for a while, but it sounded like a fantasy concept from a magical world, something completely different from the technological worlds he had heard from the previous two stories.As Morris said, if all they had to go upon were those fragmented historical texts, then it\u2019s no wonder nobody could decipher the truth.\u201cPerhaps you are right. There is a \u2018horizon limit\u2019 on the key event to the Great Annihilation,\u201d Morris\u2019s voice came from across the counter again, interrupting Duncan\u2019s train of thought. Rubbing the forehead as he spoke in a low tone, \u201cWe cannot observe the \u2018event\u2019 on the other side of the horizon, so the history before the Great Annihilation is a concept for us that can never be traced.\u201dIt\u2019s then Duncan\u2019s brain got a bold and new idea over how distressed the old man appeared, which he said aloud: \u201cThen\u2026. what if these records are all true?\u201dMorris raised an eyebrow and looked at Duncan with some surprise: \u201cOh?\u201d\u201cWhat if all these records are true, and the history recorded by each city-state or race is really what they know the world as before the Great Annihilation?\u201d Duncan rubbed his chin and said thoughtfully, \u201cMaybe our ancestors 10,000 years ago really came from completely different homelands and had completely different civilizations? The Great Annihilation trapped these exiles from different worlds on this sea, and the records are the results of those descendants who managed to survive before the knowledge was lost in time?\u201dNow that he\u2019s on a roll, Duncan didn\u2019t pause and went on a tangent: \u201cThe essence of the Great Annihilation may not actually be the end of the world, but a \u2018great teleportation\u2019?\u201dMorris appeared shocked at how wide his eyes had become: \u201c\u2026 The conjecture of the Brock Bendis school? World Drift Theory? This is a relatively unpopular genre to study.\u201dHe was amazed, but now it was Duncan\u2019s turn to be confused. The ghost captain didn\u2019t expect others to come up with this idea before him.\u201cI only have little tidbits in this regard. Years of experience and occasional reading, but I do like this theory.\u201d\u201cI also like it as well. Although it\u2019s unpopular.\u201d Morris shook his head, \u201cBut like all other conjecturing theories, we don\u2019t have evidence, so it\u2019s just a theory.\u201d\u201cOther schools also have some interesting theories. The Clark school for example assumed the distorted history is due to subspace corrupting the truth, while the Villentium school believes the world was a myriad of isolated lattices before the Great Annihilation. And then there\u2019s the Bologna city-state, the people living there does not believe the world existed at all before the Great Annihilation. Instead, they claim the historical texts are merely illusions created by the shadows in subspace to fool the world\u2026.\u201d\u201cAllow me to say something forbidden Mr. Duncan, but even heretical cults have their own version and understanding of this world. Take the preaching Enders that worship subspace as their religion. Their version is that the world\u2019s end is already upon us, that history is only catching up upon the world from the rivers of time. The cryptic and chaotic records we know of? They\u2019re all because of subspaces corruption, polluting the truth until everything is torn apart. Once the corruption is complete, that\u2019s when the whole world will fall into subspace\u2026\u201dThe more Duncan listened, the more shocked he became. After a long time, the man subconsciously shook his head to get himself in order: \u201cI didn\u2019t know that there were so many strange assumptions\u2026\u201d\u201cOrdinary people don\u2019t dabble in this field, so it\u2019s not common to hear such stories. What\u2019s more, anything related to history is inherently dangerous due to its relation with the occult,\u201d Morris said. \u201cBut one truth remains: if thousands of scholars spent hundreds or even thousands of years groping on a certain field with no resolution, they must\u2019ve formulated all the possibilities already.\u201dDuncan slowly understood what the old man meant. These people do not lack imagination or vision to see beyond the fog, but rather they lack the fundamental foundation and evidence to support their theories.\u201c\u2026\u2026 Isn\u2019t there any evidence left? Like any at all?\u201d Duncan asked with a look of bewilderment, \u201cIs there not a single physical trace to go upon? There must\u2019ve been some clues to track, otherwise there wouldn\u2019t be so many wild histories out there.\u201d\u201cSo far, it has not been discovered,\u201d Morris said slowly. \u201c10,000 years, plus one dark age after another in between with countless city-states rising and falling, if there was something, it would\u2019ve been lost and destroyed along the way by now. What can be passed down are manuscripts of unreliable sources, or second-hand oral stories like in the elvish states.\u201dDuncan didn\u2019t know what to say until he eventually compressed the emotions into one single sigh. \u201cStudying the ancient history of this world is really difficult.\u201d\u201cYes, we have to not only face the fragmented ages of history but also the status quo of nothing to grasp upon,\u201d Morris sighed. \u201cWith limited resources on each island, no city-state can fully invest its resources in such a field. And if there is something to be excavated, it\u2019s very likely been dug up by now on land. What can\u2019t be excavated is likely at a place that mortals like us can\u2019t reach.\u201d\u201cLike the bottom of the sea?\u201d Duncan said suddenly.\u201cUnder the sea? Ha, what a frightening and bold statement,\u201d Morris laughed with amusement. \u201cBut indeed, that is something a lot of historians thought about when they have nothing but desperation left\u2026. There are likely pieces of evidence at the bottom of the sea, perhaps mountains of artifacts from other civilizations. It would explain a lot of mysteries we have now. Sadly, no mortal can dive into the depths of the sea.\u201dSpeaking of this, he paused for a moment: \u201cBut this does give rise to another hypothesis\u2026 Although the idea hasn\u2019t evolved into a school yet by other scholars, but many people have speculated that the \u2018old world\u2019 is actually hidden in the ocean. More precisely, located in the depths between the deep sea and spirit world.\u201d\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d Duncan\u2019s interest got piqued by this idea.Morris thought for a while and explained: \u201cBecause many broken ancient records mentioned the world before the Great Annihilation had a \u2018starry sky\u2019, and we all know, the starry sky is the interfacing layer between the deep sea and the spirit world.\u201dDuncan almost choked himself to death due to his own saliva: \u201cAhem\u2026 wah?\u201d\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Morris was taken aback by Duncan\u2019s strong reaction, \u201cThis shouldn\u2019t be so shocking\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine. I was too deeply drawn into your story that I accidentally choked.\u201d Duncan quickly waved his hand to let the old man continue, \u201cThe starry sky is between the deep sea and the spirit world, of course I know, of course I know\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 93": "Chapter 93 \u201cThis Is Common Sense\u201dThis Translation is hosted on https://bcatranslation.com/Duncan quickly adjusted his expression and state of mind so that he did not look like a \u201cforeigner\u201d that lacked common sense. Yet, his mind could no longer remain calm for his heart was churning up a storm.Why? Because this world\u2019s sky had no stars. The starry stars mentioned here are in the world between the ocean and the spirit world, a strange and freaky phenomenon that couldn\u2019t even be fathomed by those on Earth.For this so-called \u201ccommon sense\u201d, Duncan could only curse in frustration.To be fair, for the short period of coming to this world, the ghost captain had done a lot. He\u2019s driven the Vanished into the depths of the spirit world and entered the chaotic lower cabins of the ship connecting to subspace. Yet, he\u2019s never seen the \u201cstarry sky\u201d between the deep sea and spirit world\u2026 this happens to be his blind spot so far.Stars\u2026\u2026 hiding in the depths of the sea\u2026 What a weird and bizarre situation if it\u2019s true? Is the so-called \u201cstarry sky\u201d mentioned by Morris the same thing as the \u201cstarry sky\u201d I know? What is the form of the place where the spirit world meets the deep sea? Is there a deeper, darker ocean? Or is it just a special spatial structure named after the ocean?For some reason, Duncan suddenly thought of the girl named Shirley and her inseparable pet and weapon called \u201cDog\u201d.Dog was a creature of the shadows known as Dark Hound in this world, a demon creature summoned from the depths of the nether.Duncan couldn\u2019t imagine the physiological structure of such a skeletal hound, but judging from its appearance, it was clearly not an \u201caquatic creature\u201d\u2026 Going by that, he could boldly speculate that the so-called \u201cdeep sea\u201d may not necessarily be a body of ocean.It could be an extremely vast and bizarre space that\u2019s wrapped up by the starry sky.As Duncan sketched the spatial model in his mind, Morris finally started to notice the absentmindedness of the antique shop owner. Asking curiously: \u201cAbout astrology, do you also dabble in the field?\u201d\u201cI\u2026 have some interest,\u201d Duncan pulled the corner of his lips up, finding it amusing that the world would have something like astrology when they lacked stars in the sky. \u201cBut the starry sky is hidden in such a deep place\u2026 it\u2019s not easy to explore the topic.\u201d\u201cOf course, the field is extremely dangerous to explore, but not impossible. We too can use some indirect scientific means to observe the projection of the starry sky thanks to the advancement of technology. Like the spirit lenses used by a navigator. Ever since the city-states improved its design, those who go mad from repeated use has gone down by huge margins.\u201d Morris breaks out into a delighted laugh at the topic. It\u2019s been a long time since he got someone willing to discuss such things with him so he\u2019s in a very good mood. \u201cYou know, a century ago, the profession of a navigator was always the deadliest job on an ocean-going ship\u2026 In fact, I\u2019ve always wanted to collect a set of the earliest spirit lenses to study, but sadly, I never got the chance to.\u201dDuncan was blinking dully then. He didn\u2019t care what the old gent was spouting there, instead he was only interested in a new question that popped up as a result: in this world, how do navigators guide their ships if there are no stars up in the sky?Turns out the answer remains the same after some more back and forth \u2013 by relying on the stars. Instead of looking up though, the ships looked down at the waters with the spirit lenses. By observing the reflecting stars from beneath the depths, they could effectively achieve the same results using the scientific instrument. However, that doesn\u2019t mean the job didn\u2019t come with risks.Before the 1800\u2019s of the new calendar, those who acted as navigators would often lose their minds or die from corruption. That\u2019s the cost of constantly peering at the deep sea where foul shadows lurked.\u201cYou are such a learned person.\u201d After discussing many more questions, Duncan finally couldn\u2019t help but sigh sincerely. \u201cNina is lucky to have a teacher like you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m also glad to see her having an uncle like you,\u201d Morris nodded reservedly, \u201cNow that all my doubts are gone, I can feel at ease knowing she\u2019s in your hands. You are a competent guardian and a man of wide interests with a strong thirst for knowledge. Seriously\u2026 I haven\u2019t had such a nice conversation with someone in a long time.\u201dThe old man said, sighing slightly as well: \u201cMy current life is good, quiet, and peaceful. I didn\u2019t have the same problems when I lived in the upper city, but it does get boring at times without people to talk to at the same level. Even my fellow coworkers at the school rarely chat with me because of the subjects I like.\u201d\u201cI\u2019d love to be your audience,\u201d Duncan smiled when he heard this, \u201cI\u2019m particularly interested in history.\u201d\u201cI can see that,\u201d Old Mr. Morris chuckled comfortably and then glanced in the direction of the window, where he became shocked by the hour. \u201cOh goddess, look at the time. Have I actually been here all afternoon?\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, it\u2019s okay to stay here overnight too,\u201d Duncan said casually. \u201cYou can try my cooking skills.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 I should be able to catch the bus back to the Crossroad,\u201d Morris glanced at the sinking sun and declined Duncan\u2019s kindness. \u201cThank you for the invitation, but I think I\u2019d better get home. The city has not been peaceful lately, and not returning all night will worry the family.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right, then I won\u2019t keep you\u2026.\u201d Duncan thought for a moment and got up to send the old teacher off, \u201cI\u2019ll call Nina down first.\u201dAs soon as Morris wanted to say something, Duncan had already turned to the second floor and summoned the girl, \u201cNina! Mr. Morris is going home, come down and see your teacher off!\u201dFootsteps promptly came from the stairs. Wearing casual clothes now, Nina first greeted her teacher before glancing at the sky outside the window. Showing a surprising face: \u201cYou two actually talked for this long?!\u201d\u201cWe had a great conversation,\u201d Morris said with a smile, \u201cand your uncle is a man with a wide range of interests and the willingness to learn.\u201dDuncan kept a serious look to the side and nodded silently.The so-called conversation was in fact actually the old gentleman unilaterally speaking on his own while Duncan pretended to listen intently at times. Of course, the antique shop owner wouldn\u2019t divulge something like that.Nina gave her uncle a suspicious look but then quickly corrected her attitude and tugged at the man\u2019s sleeve in a squeamish fashion. \u201cDid you talk about me?\u201d\u201cJust a little bit about your school studies,\u201d Morris may look old, but his hearing was pristine so he didn\u2019t miss the girl\u2019s whisper. \u201cYour uncle will tell you. Don\u2019t worry, I didn\u2019t complain about you.\u201dWhile speaking, the old man picked up the cane that he had put aside when he entered and confirmed his new prize in his arm \u2013 the old dagger. Once done, he bid the uncle and niece a pleasant farewell before slowly strolling out of the shop.After confirming they were alone, Duncan locked the door for good. In his view, more business was unlikely to come through the door today. Besides, he just made a lot of money. There\u2019s no reason to work so hard anymore.\u201cI\u2019ll take you to buy a bicycle tomorrow,\u201d he says with a smile.\u201cHuh?\u201d Nina didn\u2019t react at once, \u201cWhy\u2026\u201d\u201cI got a bonus from City Hall and landed another big sale today. I think we can live a more comfortable life now\u2026.\u201d Duncan rubbed his chin in thought, \u201cA bike will come in handy, so it\u2019s time we got you one.\u201d\u201cBig business,\u201d Nina finally returned to her senses, \u201cAh, you sold that dagger to Mr. Morris?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Duncan nodded, \u201cfor more than three thousand Solas.\u201dNina: \u201c\u2026!?\u201dThe girl, who had a good concept of money, was taken aback by this number. Showing a skeptical and wary face, \u201cBut what am I going to do? My teacher only came for a visit and you\u2019ve sold him an item for three thousand solas! When word gets around, everyone\u2019s going to be talking about us!\u201dDuncan raised an eyebrow and wondered why she was so worried: \u201cThen our store will be famous, right?\u201dNina: \u201cAre you serious?\u201dSpreading his hands out: \u201cYou can\u2019t expect us to give something so valuable away for free, right? It\u2019s rare that our store has something real for once.\u201dNina jabbed her arms against the waist and bulged that cheek up, clearly displeased by the reply. Then as if deflated, she turned the gloom to a cheery smile.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 94": "Chapter 94 \u201cNina\u2019s Weird Dream\u201dThis Translation is hosted on https://bcatranslation.com/It was getting dark on the street.After seeing Morris off and tidying up the storefront on the first floor, Duncan finally had time to tell Nina about what her teacher had said during the home visit.After all, this was actually the main reason why Mr. Morris came to visit today\u2014although the two of them did go off-topic after chatting later.\u201cHave you been not resting well lately? Or is there something wrong with your health?\u201d At the dinner table on the second floor, Duncan asked with concern while spreading butter on slices of bread, \u201cI heard from your teacher that you have been like this for several days.\u201dNina was obviously a little nervous as she probably guessed what had been talked about. \u201cI\u2019m just a little tired\u2026\u201d\u201cThen it seems that what Mr. Morris said is true,\u201d Duncan carefully observed Nina\u2019s expression, \u201cPhysical reasons? Or is it because of something else? If you have something on your mind, you can tell me.\u201dSpeaking of this, he paused, then added: \u201cOf course, there may be some things at your age that you don\u2019t want to tell adults like me, and this is normal. You are growing after all. Everyone should have their own ideas and personalities, which I respect. Still, you must remember that asking for help when needed is not shameful. Tell me if I can help, and we will find a solution together.\u201dHe tried to make his words seem reliable and kind, which was not easy with all things considering. A drunken gambler that was so ill that he fell into being a cultist could hardly be called reliable.\u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m really okay, really!\u201d Nina seemed a little uncomfortable with such a kind uncle, but deep down, she didn\u2019t resist such a change. Waving her hand up vigorously, \u201cI\u2019m only feeling tired lately, and when I\u2019m awake, I feel sleepy like I\u2019m dreaming.\u201d\u201cDreaming?\u201d Duncan frowned, suddenly thinking of something, \u201cNightmare? Was it a dream of the fire when you were a child?\u201dPerhaps because he was paying attention to the sun fragments and the unsolved case eleven years ago, he suddenly had this idea that Nina would be related.\u201cNo, not when I was a child.\u201d Nina shakes her head.\u201cWhat is it then?\u201d\u201cI always dream of\u2026 dreaming that I am standing in a very high place, like a tower in the city, and the streets below my feet are dark and full of ruins.\u201d Nina recalled, slowly diving back into the images she had, \u201cThe ruins and ashes are like a huge scar running along the center of the city. It goes from the Crossroad up to the Upper City. I felt trapped and wanted to run, but an invisible wall kept blocking my way\u2026.\u201dNina suddenly shook her head to dispel the nasty feeling: \u201cIt\u2019s always like this in the dreams. Technically, it\u2019s not all that frightening if I look back at it. There wasn\u2019t anything chasing me or something like that. I only got scared because of the huge scar running across the city. Then whenever I get too stressed, I would jerk awake from the dream until it repeats again\u2026.\u201dDuncan listened carefully to the girl\u2019s description and slowly frowned.What Nina described\u2026 It is really not the fire she experienced in childhood, nor the scene I remember from this body.It\u2019s more like a running picture of a different Pland from another space and time.If it were on Earth, Duncan would only regard this as a strange dream resulting from stress and workload, but in this strange and abnormal world, being haunted by the same nightmare spelled something worse.\u201cWhen did you start having these dreams?\u201d Duncan asked with a serious expression.\u201cAbout a week or two ago? Or maybe earlier\u2026 I can\u2019t remember,\u201d Nina took a sip of the vegetable soup, her voice a little slurred, \u201cI didn\u2019t pay much care to it at the time\u2026.\u201dAfter hearing this, Duncan wanted to say \u201cyou should have told me earlier\u201d, but then remembered that Nina\u2019s \u201cuncle\u201d was still a rotten person addicted to some deplorable activities back then. An unreliable person could never be of help, so he swallowed the words back down.\u201cHave you consulted a professional yet? Like a doctor?\u201dNina raised her head: \u201cYou mean a psychiatrist?\u201d\u201cYes, psychiatrist.\u201d Duncan thought about it and immediately nodded.In this world, \u201cpsychiatrist\u201d is an indispensable profession. There are too many things watching the city-state at night. From the shadows lurking in the depths to the heretical heirs of the chaotic religions, all of which wanted to harm the mortals. However, the most problematic are the psychological kind \u2013 nightmares, hallucinations, and cognitive deviations from reality. The only field that tackles this was psychology, and in this world, it\u2019s not a profession that sits you down and has a nice chat, they also use supernatural powers at times to correct the distorted mindset.Nina\u2019s frequent strange dreams should also belong to the \u201cdisease\u201d these psychiatrists pay attention to.\u201cI haven\u2019t,\u201d Nina said sullenly, \u201ctheir fees are expensive\u2026 I was just having weird dreams.\u201d\u201cBut these strange dreams have begun to affect your life,\u201d Duncan said seriously, \u201cand continuing to dream about these strange scenes may be a dangerous sign. You must have learned this in school, did you not?\u201dWhile saying this, he was also quick to add inside his heart \u2013 there must be something wrong with Nina\u2019s continuous strange dreams. In any case, since he already lives here in a strange and abnormal world, he must be wary of the \u201celements\u201d of these supernatural fields.As it so happens, he also wants to meet the \u201cprofessionals\u201d of this field using this opportunity. It would be good to learn how they treat those who are ill so he could copy\u2026Nina was obviously still a little hesitant, but in front of Duncan\u2019s serious expression, she finally lost the battle. \u201cThat\u2026 then we can go to the community church on the weekend and ask the storm pastor to do a blessing. The cost is very small for that, and if it doesn\u2019t work, we can find a special psychiatrist afterward, okay?\u201dChurch? Storm Priest? Those who follow the Storm Goddess Gamona?Duncan found this arrangement to be very good. He also wants to meet a priest serving the gods too.\u201cOkay, that\u2019s settled then.\u201d He nodded immediately, \u201cJust because you\u2019re going to the museum on the weekend, we\u2019ll stop by the church when you get back.\u201d\u201cHmm!\u201dAfter dinner, Nina and Duncan both went back to their rooms, the latter being accompanied by Ai\u2019s lazy figure lying on the windowsill.The dove had been flying outside all day and had returned without harvest.\u201cHurry, destroy, tired\u2026\u201d Ai mopes and rests her head down like a pig when her master saunters over.\u201cYou really worked hard,\u201d Duncan knew that it was indeed a tiring day for this bird, so he readily untied the cultists\u2019 sensor from her back. Soothing Ai\u2019s feathers as he spoke, \u201cThis is indeed not going to be easy. They are hiding deeply now that the Storm Church is watching.\u201dThe dove rolled her eyes and flapped those wings in protest.Amused by the childish behaviour, Duncan taps the bird\u2019s head as a tease: \u201cEven so, this still has to be done\u2026 Of course, flying for a full day is indeed a little too intense, so I will arrange a combination of work and rest for you.\u201dHe decided to do the search for cultists in the city a long-term project at this stage. Although after doing today\u2019s \u201cbig business\u201d, he\u2019s no longer in urgent need of money, but removing rats from the city was still a meaningful act in itself.Besides, he might actually hook a big fish somewhere down the line. The grunts won\u2019t mean much in the equation, but the benefits of catching a sun heir were too tempting to not try. And on top of that, he\u2019s quite concerned about the sun fragment incident from eleven years ago. It\u2019s giving him bad vibes.On the second hand, there seems to be a wild loli and dog running about in the city-state. The other party was constantly making trouble for the suntists. If he goes by that trail, he might run into the pair again if luck would permit. There are a lot of questions he had for those two regarding the deep sea and the starry sky mentioned by Morris. Who better to answer this than those who dabble in the power of the deep sea?Noticing the serious expression on Duncan\u2019s face, Ai sighs extremely humanely upon realizing there\u2019s no way out of work.\u201cAiya,\u201d the bird\u2019s tone was full of sorrow, \u201cthere is already a sad thick barrier between us\u2026\u201dDuncan: \u201c\u2026 Your vocabulary is quite rich!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 95": "Chapter 95 \u201cInfiltration\u201dThis Translation is hosted on https://bcatranslation.com/Another handful of sun heretics who had infiltrated Pland by smuggling aboard a ship has been intercepted by the church today. For this reason, Vanna\u2019s been busy interrogating the prisoners until late into the evening.\u201cInquisitor Vanna,\u201d the slightly emaciated regional bishop saluted the young inquisitor, \u201cmay the waves shelter your soul.\u201d\u201cMay the waves shelter your soul too,\u201d Vanna replied to the bishop, then walked to the chair on the side with a somewhat tired step. \u201cThis is already the second batch of sun heretics thrown into prison, right?\u201d\u201cYes, we caught a dozen of them at the port three days ago already. They were promptly detected and stopped when they tried to kill a citizen. This new group is the second batch. They aroused the alarm of a meter reader during a dark ceremony in the apartment building,\u201d the regional bishop nodded with a slightly worried look in his eyes. \u201cTo think so many cultists managed to infiltrate our city already\u2026 Fortunately, we found out early, otherwise their dark ritual would\u2019ve caused devastating damage to the people.\u201d\u201cPland is a transportation hub on the Boundless Sea, and the calm of the past four years has paralyzed a lot of people\u2019s awareness.\u201d Vanna nodded in agreement, \u201cBut\u2026 It is not certain that we discovered their intents early or late. Those who came before the alarms went off might\u2019ve already dug themselves deep inside a hole to avoid exposure.\u201dThe regional bishop glanced at the inquisitor\u2019s expression, hesitated for a moment, then asked, \u201cI heard that many people have also been arrested in other areas?\u201d\u201cYes, in almost every city sector,\u201d Vanna did not hide the truth. \u201cNow in the underground cells of almost every church are captured heretics. From several to dozens\u2026. But most of them are mere minions that had hardly any training. The priests have so far mostly been able to evade capture.\u201dVanna\u2019s tone unconsciously became serious when she spoke at the end. She\u2019s also leaking worry on her face due to what\u2019s to come.Ever since the operation of these heretics trying to find the sun fragment became known to the authorities, the church had reacted quickly and launched a full-scale search across the entire city-state. Whether it be the slums or high-end communities, they\u2019ve searched it all. The only parts they struggled with were the sewers and unknown sectors.\u201cEvery day there are results, but we still couldn\u2019t find out who\u2019s pulling the strings, which gives me a bad feeling about the deteriorating situation.\u201d Vanna explains her woes in front of the regional bishop, \u201cWith such a large invasion force, it is impossible to operate without a high-ranking commander behind them. Yet, we still don\u2019t have a clue as to who\u2019s behind it.\u201dThe regional bishop pondered for a moment and slowly spoke: \u201cAccording to the results of the current interrogation, these minions only obey the orders of the \u2018emissaries\u2019, and the so-called \u2018emissaries\u2019 are a group of low-level priests who directly got their orders through the sun masks they wore. Could the sun heirs already be lurking inside the city?\u201d\u201cThe sun heirs lurking inside a human state? Logically speaking, that\u2019s unlikely,\u201d Vanna\u2019s brows furrowed slightly at the idea. \u201cAlthough they have great power, they also have obvious \u2018traces of existence that can\u2019t be hidden. The filthy and foul stench they produce would\u2019ve been picked up by the patrolling guardians. Theoretically, the routes we set should have no blind spots.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just a guess in the end,\u201d the regional bishop shook his head, \u201cI also know how difficult it is for the sun heirs to hide their presence from society. But those low-level \u201cemissaries\u201d do carry a sun mask. Even if they are not directly controlled by an heir, they must be maintaining contact to a certain extent\u2026 After all, mass-produced holy relics are not cheap. The cost would put a dent in anyone\u2019s pocket.\u201dVanna rubbed her chin in thought after being reminded about the cost factor: \u201cAccording to the interrogation record, those heretics are mainly inquiring about the supernatural event from eleven years ago, right? They believe it has something to do with the sun fragment?\u201d\u201cIt seems so,\u201d the regional bishop nodded. \u201cAlthough they do not know the source of their intelligence, they seem convinced that the sun fragments caused the \u2018chemical plant riot\u2019 in Pland eleven years ago\u2026 I remember you too were\u2026\u201dThe regional bishop stopped partway due to the striking scar on Vanna\u2019s left eye. Slightly lowering his head in shame for being so inconsiderate: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I was careless.\u201dSubconsciously brushing her hand against the scar, Vanna shook her head to dispel such emotions: \u201cIt\u2019s okay, just a scar. You\u2019re correct though, I did witness the riot personally so there\u2019s no need to hold back.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve learned that there was also a group of sun heretics among those who rioted back then. We are sure of this after arresting hundreds of saboteurs.\u201d The regional bishop now sounded heavy in his voice, \u201cBut the infiltrated heretics don\u2019t seem to know anything about the events eleven years ago\u2026. If they are part of the same cult, wouldn\u2019t they have at least some information on what happened? Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s weird?\u201d\u201cEleven years ago\u2026. Either the branch in Pland acted without permission and didn\u2019t communicate with the others, or the sun fragment\u2019s appearance was a complete accident back then. Regardless of which, nothing good could come of it. There\u2019s also the possibility that it\u2019s the handiwork of a third force who remained in the shadows, and that the sun heretics are merely a pawn that got used.\u201d Vanna conjectures using what little knowledge she knows, \u201cAnd according to the records we have, those captured \u2018saboteurs\u2019 back then were all in a state of madness and delirium. I\u2019m more inclined to believe they were under the influence of a powerful force that\u2019s not their own.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 Chasing twisted and dark things, only to be dominated by said dark forces before being tossed aside like firewood during the chaos\u2026.\u201d The regional bishop sighed at how incredibly sad and foolish those pawns were, \u201cWhat a miserable life.\u201dVanna didn\u2019t add anything to that, only standing quietly while staring out the window. From where she was, the lady could observe what was happening at the port from a distance. The blockade and cordoning have ended by now, and many of the piers were reopened during the day except for Pier 1. The reason was that it housed the latest steamship, the White Oak, which was constantly being monitored by the priests.Vanna eventually retracted her gaze from the port after remembering something else: \u201cI heard the notice for Anomaly 099 has been issued to the port area?\u201d\u201cYes, it just arrived this afternoon. Would you like to take a look?\u201d The regional bishop said as he took out the folded documents from his possession, \u201cFor some reason, it came a little later than expected.\u201d\u201cShow me,\u201d Vanna reached out and took the document, \u201cand it\u2019s normal to be a little late considering what\u2019s involved. Anomaly 099\u2019s out-of-control state is very special after all. Considering the fact that it went missing during a direct confrontation with the Vanished, the bishops of the other city-states must weigh the wording and information carefully before releasing the document. Merely knowing about the matter might create a direct connection with that ghost ship if we\u2019re not careful.\u201dWhen the lady mentioned the word \u201cVanished\u201d, the oil lamp closest to Vanna suddenly flickered, followed by a subtle crackling sound of which shouldn\u2019t be.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 96": "Chapter 96 \u201cPeering\u201dThis Translation is hosted on https://bcatranslation.com/Sitting inside the captain\u2019s room of the Vanished, Duncan slowly opens his eyes after transferring the bulk of his consciousness over. Glancing around the room, he found nothing astray. It\u2019s the familiar furnishing, the same glistening glow of the setting sun shining off the golden mask on the table, and most importantly, the same white dove plopping down at the shelves like a lazy dog.So why did he return? Simple, the man\u2019s trying an experiment \u2013 what could he do with the shell back in the antique shop while only a small portion of his mind controlled the body? The answer came quickly once he went outside and met an old street neighbor. They exchanged some pleasantries of the weather, said a few words about the recent events, and then bid farewell due to the late hour. Of course, the shop owner\u2019s actions were rigid and sluggish, but who would care about the behaviors of a drug-addicted gambler known to be ill?Pleased by the results from the experiment, Duncan smiled and returned his full attention to the ship where he picked up the golden mask. There are a lot of things he could do in Pland, but there was not enough sunlight to do it all in one day. He could try it during night time of course. However, that would surely draw the attention of the authorities. Best not to try that method.Now back to the mask at hand. It\u2019s heavy, likely cast out of pure metal.Looking at the golden thing, Duncan began to ponder the possibilities. Was the thing made of pure gold? If so, should he sell it for a lot of money?Sure, he\u2019s currently free from the burden of financial pressure, but who said he couldn\u2019t use the fund at a later date? Nobody ever complains about having too much money, and he wouldn\u2019t either.Those cultists are like sheep with multi-purpose uses. They provide him with intel about the world, their existence reported for bounties, and their supernatural items like this mask refined for further exploitation\u2026.\u201cThe sun cultists are so full of treasures, hoho\u2026.\u201d The ghost captain rubs his chin like a devious businessman.Ai, who was strolling about on the shelf now, suddenly stopped and stared at the crude behavior. Sharply crying out in her female voice: \u201cCan you not be so inhumane? Can you not be so inhumane?\u201d\u201cYou are not qualified to talk about me, you blasted bird!\u201d Duncan shoots an accusing finger right back at Ai, who was bobbing her head up and down in disgust.Then rubbing his fingertip to summon up a spark of green flame, the ghost captain returns his attention to what he had in mind. First, he\u2019s going to clean out whatever taint the mask has before doing some tests. However, right as he\u2019s about to carry out the act, a mysterious and ethereal voice seemingly echoes out from within his heart.\u201cOr it might connect them to the Vanished~\u201dDuncan\u2019s body froze into a cinderblock, shocked by the sound that came out of the blue.He turned and faced the bird next to himself: \u201cDid you hear anything?\u201dFlapping her wings, Ai proudly sang her woes like a barb in a tavern: \u201cListen~ the voice of the sea is crying ~ oh heavens, thou shalt hurt us again ~.\u201d\u201cStop, stop, stop\u2026 I shouldn\u2019t have asked you at all!\u201d Duncan quickly glared at the dove to make her stop. He totally regrets ever trying to communicate with the likes of this bird.Shirking off his discomfort, the ghost captain carefully searched from within for the brief \u201cconnection\u201d he got during the interaction. It was all darkness at first, but soon, he saw a glimmer of light emerging from the front. Grabbing onto this to not let it evade his grasp, the man pulls himself forward using the power of the ghost fire. He couldn\u2019t see much at first, only the chittering chattering voices behind an oval-shaped mirror found commonly in homes of this world.This was about as far as he got before something blocked him. There\u2019s an invisible veil blocking his consciousness from advancing. Then it hit him. It\u2019s not that he lacked the ability to enhance the connection, but rather Duncan didn\u2019t have a medium to possess like the other shell inside the antique shop to station his mind in reality.Understanding the problem, Duncan came to the mirror and casually touched the mirror with his flame.The ghostly green flowed outwards, rippling through the silver surface to form a new layer atop the mirror. In the next second, the shimmering stopped, and now he could see behind the muddled image of the mirror with clarity!Overtaken by curiosity, Duncan leaned over and peered into the room illuminated by lights. There\u2019s an unusually tall lady standing near the window and reading something using the afterglow of the skylight. Based on her lax stance, it doesn\u2019t appear she had noticed the spooky presence currently observing her from the rear.\u2026\u2026Vanna\u2019s gaze remained firmly on the document she was currently reading, confirming the content verbatim.This was a jointly discussed and drafted document by the bishops of each city-state. Then personally reviewed and approved by His Majesty the Pope sitting in the Storm Cathedral using the spiritual resonance they shared. The whole process had no room for mistake and was sheltered under the watchful gaze of the goddess to ensure the texts weren\u2019t corrupted.Such a special document served only one purpose: to inform every voyaging ship that sails the sea a superior anomaly has escaped the control of the civilized world.This was necessary.The anomalies that are out of control on the boundless sea will not disappear forever in the eyes of the world. Although the deep sea would eventually swallow everything, it never swallows the \u201canomalies\u201d that fall into it. Instead, those who are out of control would wander on the fridges of the civilized world more bizarrely and dangerously like wolves wandering around the pastures, chasing and threatening the safety of voyages. Almost every year, seafarers would die due to these out-of-control anomalies.And as the custodian and sealer of said anomaly, every church has the duty of informing the captains who may encounter such danger. No one would think it was damaging to the church\u2019s reputation because this was one of the primary responsibilities of the church to begin with.Timely notification of the out-of-control situation may be able to save a ship that unfortunately encountered an anomaly one day in the future or have the possibility of resealing and containing the danger.Under normal circumstances, such a notice would be sent to the port unit within 24 hours of the out-of-control incident, but this notice involving \u201canomaly 099\u201d was a little later than normal.Why? Because this event involves not only Anomaly 099 \u2013 the puppet coffin, but also Vision 005 \u2013 the Vanished. There\u2019s a strict criterion for such a high-profile case. It\u2019s dangerous to know too much in this world less they want to draw the attention of said danger through the knowledge.Vanna\u2019s face sank as she read the document word by word, confirming whether the phrasing in the paper conformed to the sacred and invisible structure of prayer and whether it could avoid the gaze of the infamous ghost captain.And on the window glass beside her, in the gap between the light and shadow that neither she nor the regional bishop could perceive, Duncan was leaning his head out at the contents of the document and became shocked.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 97": "Chapter 97 \u201cWho is making the list?\u201dThis Translation is hosted on https://bcatranslation.com/After a little recollection, Duncan finally remembered where he had seen this face\u2014this was the prestigious female inquisitor of Pland, Vanna Wayne!Her name and picture appeared in the newspapers.Why am I seeing such a scene? And why is the person a follower of the storm goddess? Is there a hidden connection between her and me? When did it get established? How come I didn\u2019t notice it before?Countless thoughts popped up in Duncan\u2019s mind for a moment, but the next second, the messy thoughts were interrupted by something that swept into his line of sight \u2013 the document Vanna was reading.The content was written in a rigorous format, with the sacred symbol of the storm goddess printed on the paper. The first sentence at the beginning was as follows: I hereby inform the captains and accompanying priests and guides that Anomaly 099, the puppet coffin, has recently gone out of control. The most holy and wise have witnessed the cursed thing being lost in the storm, and the characteristics are hereby as listed\u2026.Duncan\u2019s eyes slowly widened as he gazed over Vanna\u2019s shoulder. The document described various details relating to Alice. Like where she originated from, what curses she possessed, how she was concepted, and the nickname Alice Guillotine\u2026Eventually, his gaze locked onto a bit about the White Oak being attacked. He wanted to read more, but Vanna\u2019s tall stature blocked off the important bits from view.\u201cOne side, just move a little bit to one side\u2026\u201d Duncan cursed inwardly and kept repeating the phrase.Still unaware of the snooping ghost captain, Vanna suddenly felt a wisp of cold breeze blowing around her earlobe. Out of reflex, she subconsciously looked to the window where she had left a crack open for air. The lady\u2019s not afraid of course. The flames from the oil lamps will dispel any malicious shadows at night.\u201cGo ahead and store it. The wording by the head bishops is very good. It\u2019s safe to begin distribution.\u201d She hands the document back to the cleric.The regional bishop nodded, then stepped forward to take away the document. Turning on the electric lamp in the room to brighten the darkness, the cleric asks: \u201cAre you going to rush back to the central cathedral tonight?\u201d\u201cBishop Valentine is still waiting for me to discuss things,\u201d Vanna bowed her head slightly, \u201cThe city is restless lately. We may need to conduct a large-scale prayer service to strengthen the protection around the state.\u201dAfter saying that, she glanced up at the chandelier hanging from the roof where the light bulbs were shining. Sighing at the image: \u201cAigh\u2026. if only electric lights have the same effect of dispelling evil spirits like a flame. Their range is so much farther\u2026\u201d\u201cI know Milady,\u201d the regional bishop spread out his hands, \u201cit\u2019s a pity that electricity is not sacred.\u201dVanna shook her head and said nothing to comment. It was time she left, which she did by bidding farewell to the cleric and striding out of the lounge.After Vanna left and the cleric dispersed, only the burning oil lamp remained near the window, flickering and burning eerily with a green tint to the orange. Then it faded, returning to the common yellowish orange.Duncan had retracted his connection away from the mirror and dispelled the layer of green film. He\u2019s seen enough. In the last second when Vanna turned around, one line instantly caught his eye: Vision 005 \u2013 the Vanished.\u201cSo the classification of the Vanished is indeed that of a \u2018vision\u2019, and the rank is so high too\u2026\u201d He returned to his desk and muttered thoughtfully until another question wandered up. \u201cBut then again, why is the ship\u2019s ranking so high?\u201dAccording to Nina\u2019s textbook, the ranking of anomalies and visions are based upon the rules left behind by the Kingdom of Crete from ancient times. But what are the determining criteria? How do they interpret the threat? Does historical importance play a factor?Initially, Duncan never thought about these issues, but now he\u2019s got a lot of questions that need answering.This number\u2026 Is it in the order of discovery?If it is arranged in the order of discovery, then the Vanished shouldn\u2019t be this high. There are plenty of other things that came before the ship. In theory, 005 should\u2019ve been occupied long ago.But if the ranking isn\u2019t due to the time of discovery, then what\u2019s the key factor? The danger it poses? Wouldn\u2019t the ranking be in need of constant change then? Such a big constant task would be too constantly. That couldn\u2019t be it.Although Duncan lacked credible knowledge, the textbooks mention that in most situations, most upper numbers are more dangerous and frightening than the lower ones.Now this brings up a very interesting question worthy of note: if the existing list was a relatively stable and easily unchanged ranking board, then its arranger must be no different than a prophetic figure. The person must be able to predict the \u201cranking\u201d of almost every anomaly and vision. Not only to accurately assign the position when discovered but also to leave \u201cempty spaces\u201d between each number on the table for future discoveries.Duncan definitely had a lot of interest behind those making a list, but the curiosity soon died down for the time being. The reason being? He didn\u2019t expect Alice\u2019s name to be so famous!\u201cI\u2019m going out for a bit.\u201d Duncan casually said to the dove on the table and strode out of the captain\u2019s bedroom.The goat head in the charting room heard the noise and immediately turned his head with a creak. After seeing it was Duncan who came out, he routinely asked: \u201cName\u2026\u201d\u201cDuncan Abnomar. Stop asking me about that. Where is Alice?\u201d\u201cAh, captain\u2026\u201d The goat head wanted to habitually do his balabala again but was blocked with a snarl. Creaking his neck to answer, \u201cYou looking for Miss Alice? She might be counting her hair in her room\u2026\u201d\u201cCounting her hair?\u201d Duncan was stunned, \u201cWhat new problems have she added\u2026 Forget it. I\u2019ll go check on her myself. You keep sailing the ship.\u201dAfter saying this, he didn\u2019t wait for the other party to respond and turned for the ship\u2019s deck, leaving behind the goat head, who appeared taken aback by the captain\u2019s swift departure.\u201cI haven\u2019t even had time to say more\u2026\u201d After holding back for a long time, the goat head mutters depressingly, \u201cDid my ability to find a topic weaken\u2026?\u201dAs soon as his words came out, a crack swooned open from the captain\u2019s bedroom, and out came Ai the dove. She\u2019s swaggering around the mapping table like she owns it.\u201cFive bucks for a talk?\u201d The bird tilts her head and blinks those red beady eyes.\u201cOkay, okay, I\u2019ll take anyone who can chat with me!\u201d The goat head happily agrees. He hasn\u2019t had a decent conversation and was dying to talk. \u201cWhat do you want to chat about? Can you speak normally? I keep getting the feeling\u2026\u201d\u201cMake some fries.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d The goat head couldn\u2019t keep up, \u201cNo, I mean, do you have self awareness\u2026\u201d\u201cMake some fries.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 If you\u2019re going to talk about cooking at sea\u2026\u201d\u201cMake some fries.\u201d\u201cCan you say anything else?\u201d\u201cMake some fries.\u201dGoat head: \u201c\u2026\u201dDuncan did not pay attention to the silly noise behind in the room and promptly went down to the cabins below deck. Eventually, he found his way over to Alice\u2019s room and knocked: \u201cAlice, it\u2019s me.\u201dA stammering voice soon came from the other side: \u201cPle-Please\u2026 Please come in\u2026\u201dAs soon as Duncan heard this, he subconsciously raised an eyebrow and pushed the door.The doll in the gothic dress was sitting at the table next to the bed, her face directed at a mirror while being held up by her hands at the table. \u201cCap-Captain\u2026 goo-good evening\u2026\u201dDuncan: \u201cPut your head back on first before talking.\u201d\u201cOh, okay.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 98": "Chapter 98 \u201cAlice doesn\u2019t know anything\u201dImagine this picture: You are on a creaking ghost ship. You push open a wooden door in the deepest part of the corridor with dim lights flickering in the background. Then in front of you is a headless doll in her gothic-styled dress smiling at you in the creepiest fashion. No matter how one thinks about it, such a scene would be enough to scare someone to death\u2026.If Duncan didn\u2019t know Alice well enough by this point, he would\u2019ve surely pulled his gun at this instant.Alice didn\u2019t know how evil she had just made the atmosphere. Obediently pressing her head back to her neck, the girl quickly regained her agility and greeted Duncan with a bright smile: \u201cGood evening captain! Are you looking for me?\u201dDuncan then made up his mind and eyed the doll up and down suspiciously: \u201cWhat are you doing here? Why does the goat head say that you\u2019re counting your hair inside the cabin?\u201dAlice moved her neck from side to side, then gently smoothed out her slightly messy hair with those fingers before making a slightly embarrassed face: \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 to see how much hair is left.\u201dDuncan looked at the doll like a retard not comprehending. Eventually, he noticed something on the edge of the table: it was a spool that had come from who knows where, and between the combs were several silvery-white hairs. The source of which was obvious\u2026Duncan was expressionless: \u201c\u2026\u201dAlice noticed the captain\u2019s gaze and immediately explained with a serious face: \u201cLook, this one is called Miffy, this one is called Perley, this one is called Phemia, and this one, the name is\u2026\u201dDuncan finally exclaimed: \u201cYou even gave a name to every hair you lost?!\u201d\u201cAs a memento,\u201d Alice looked solemn and sad, \u201cdidn\u2019t you say I\u2019m a doll? Us puppets don\u2019t grow hair on our own\u2026 In case it all falls off one day, I\u2019m holding onto them to reminisce about the good times when I had them\u2026\u201dDuncan got dizzy due to the puppet\u2019s weird logic. He even forgot the reason for coming until he finally snapped out of it. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean what I said. You don\u2019t have to take it to heart\u2026. No wonder you kept to the cabin during these two days. You\u2019ve been naming the hair that came off each day?\u201dAlice nodded harmlessly: \u201cMhmm.\u201dDuncan tensed his face and sighed for a while: \u201cFine, I\u2019ll look for a puppeteer in the city to get a solution. You can stop this\u2026.\u201dAlice was taken aback: \u201cYou\u2019re going to tie people up and take them aboard the ship?\u201dDuncan glared at her: \u201c\u2026 I\u2019ll buy you a few wigs to spare! It\u2019s unbefitting for the Boundless Sea\u2019s mobile natural disaster to kidnap a puppeteer.\u201d\u201cBut a mobile natural disaster penetrating into the human city to buy wigs is not very befitting either\u2026\u201d Alice muttered subconsciously, but just halfway through the muttering, she quickly swallowed it back in. \u201cAh, I won\u2019t say it, hehe\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be silly,\u201d Duncan suddenly felt vexed at lowering himself to the doll\u2019s wavelength. Then waving his hand after remembering his purpose for coming, \u201cForget it, your sudden distraction caused me to get sidetracked. Sit down Alice, I have important things to speak with you.\u201dAlice knew this was no joke based on the captain\u2019s serious expression. Quickly retracting her fawning smile, she sat on her wooden coffin box and put the spool away.Duncan sighed. For some reason, he always seems to lose his composure before Alice despite being able to keep a calm composure against more shocking entities: like confronting the goat head when he first came to this world, or possessing a sacrificial body with a hole through the chest, nothing ever fazed him. Yet, before this silly and borderline goofy doll, his sanity would always hover at the edge of collapse and non-collapse.If he thought about it, this was probably due to Alice\u2019s style. It\u2019s really hard to fend against such a character.Raising a finger to make a hooking gesture at a chair, the wooden seat promptly creaked over and stationed behind Duncan\u2019s legs for him to sit.\u201cRay Nora, what is your impression of this name?\u201d\u201cRey Nora?\u201d Alice blinked, her face unpretentiously confused, \u201cI haven\u2019t heard of it\u2026 Sounds like a woman\u2019s name? And there is a sense of elegance and nobility\u2026 Your acquaintances?\u201d\u201cTheoretically, it should be your \u2018acquaintance\u2019, but you say you don\u2019t know\u2026 Very well, I believe you.\u201d Duncan was not so surprised by Alice\u2019s answer and continued, \u201cWhat about the Frostbite City-State? Are you familiar with the name? Any impressions?\u201d\u201cFrostbite City-State? I heard the name when I was in the box. It seems to be a city-state on the cold sea, and there is a place called Cold Harbor there. They said the harbor acted as the gateway from the cold sea to the central sea.\u201d Alice recalled in thought, \u201cBut I don\u2019t know the specifics, so I have only heard the name.\u201d\u201cWhat about \u2018Alice Guillotine\u2019?\u201dThe puppet looked even more confused: \u201cAlice I know, that\u2019s my name, but what is the guillotine?\u201dThis situation was basically what Duncan expected after asking several questions and getting similar responses.Alice was confused about all this, just like she said on the first day of their meeting. She didn\u2019t know her past, the truth behind Anomaly 099, about the Frostbite city-state, and she hadn\u2019t heard of the Frost Queen who died half a century ago.Even if her appearance was exactly the same as that of the Frost Queen.No matter though, he merely wanted to see the sort of reaction by mentioning these key words to Alice.So\u2026 maybe my focus should not be on the doll but on the \u201ccoffin\u201d?Duncan\u2019s eyes slowly sharpened, and his attention fell on Alice\u2019s gorgeous heavy wooden box.The ornate coffin that once housed the doll was still in the room, and Alice now sat firmly on it.Alice loved her suitcase, using it as a stool and locker and sometimes sleeping in it\u2014despite the normal beds in the room.\u201cYou open the box and let me see,\u201d Duncan said.Alice felt a little puzzled but quickly jumped down from the box and opened the lid for the man to peer inside.The wooden case was lined with soft red velvet, and in the corners were some random items sprawled around: a comb, a spool that\u2019s wrapped with her hair, a small mirror, and a few metal trinkets.\u201cI found these from the ship, in another cabin\u2026\u201d Alice explained carefully, pointing to the items in the corner of the box. \u201cI asked Mr. Goathead, and he said these were ownerless things. I\u2026 Can I keep them? I think they\u2019re beautiful\u2026\u201dDuncan looked at the old trinkets.Perhaps a century ago, someone on this ship would\u2019ve worn these things on themselves. But now, they\u2019re clearly items devoid of ownership, merely evidence that this ship once belonged to the material world.\u201cKeep them, they\u2019re yours.\u201d Duncan nodded, but then his gaze suddenly noticed a small object in the pile of items. Reaching in to pick it up, \u201cThis thing\u2026\u201dIt was a tiny hairpin, delicate and not like something that would appear on the Vanished. It resembled a silver-white feather, and it was dotted with little broken wavey patterns along the edges. Although it was still as new as it had been from a century ago, this item was clearly not of this era in design.Duncan frowned. For some reason, he felt a faint longing when he saw this hairpin\u2026There was even a name that he almost blurted out despite not recalling the exact wording.Duncan blinked in astonishment over his own reaction. He didn\u2019t know what was going on with this feeling that suddenly emerged from the bottom of his heart, but gradually, he understood.Just as he knew the name \u201cDuncan Abnomar\u201d the first time he came to this ship\u2026 He had just come into contact with the remaining \u201cechoes\u201d in his body again!He looked down at the hairpin in his hand, wondering how such a delicate and small thing could \u201cresonate\u201d with the biggest natural disaster on the Boundless Sea. But soon, Alice\u2019s voice woke him up from his thoughts: \u201cCaptain? Captain, you\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I can\u2019t give you this hairpin,\u201d Duncan said to Alice, but then he quickly realized the wording was wrong and too cold toward Miss Doll here. Quickly adding, \u201cI\u2019ll go to the city-state and buy you some new ones later\u2014they\u2019re all old.\u201d\u201cReally?!\u201d Alice suddenly showed a surprised expression, \u201cCaptain, you are so wonderful!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t get too happy just yet.\u201d Duncan shook his head and casually placed the hairpin away, \u201cwe\u2019re not done yet\u2026 Alice, the next thing I want to tell you is something about your origin.

    "Chapter 99": "Chapter 99 \u201cThe First Step to Testing and Mastery\u201dThis Translation is hosted on https://bcatranslation.com/After confirming that Alice did not respond to all the \u201ckeywords\u201d and was completely unaware of the information about the ability to \u201cdecapitate\u201d, Duncan decided to tell the confused cursed doll what he came across from that little spying venture.Because he already had a faint speculation at this time: maybe the key to the anomaly of the abnormal 099-puppet coffin wasn\u2019t the doll Alice herself\u2026 but rather it\u2019s her \u201ccoffin\u201d.Gently swaying with the waves of the Boundless Sea, Duncan went over the various details he had learned from the document with Alice. The poor lady was so scared that she had squirmed into a corner by the end of the bed.\u201cDo you have to be scared like this?\u201d\u201cBut\u2026 it\u2019s really so scary!\u201d Alice\u2019s whimpering voice sounded like she\u2019s ready to cry after listening to some horror story, \u201cWhat indiscriminate beheading, what range of death will stop, what continues to expand the scope of territory\u2026 this, this, this\u2026 I don\u2019t know any of that!\u201d\u201cI believe now that you really don\u2019t know,\u201d Duncan glanced at the frightened shivering lady who kept squirming, \u201cbut this is indeed information about the Anomaly 099-puppet coffin.\u201dAlice held her head and stared at Duncan like she\u2019s ready to pop that neck: \u201cThen\u2026\u201d\u201cSo I now have two theories. First, the above \u2018decapitation\u2019 may be your unconscious ability. You are in essence, an anomaly after all, so your power is most likely a passive range effect. Even if you were asleep before, it didn\u2019t change the occurrence and remained active without your knowledge.\u201dDuncan said, slowly getting up from his chair and came over to the ornate wooden box. Touching it with the tip of his longsword.\u201cSecond, the \u2018decapitation\u2019 power of the puppet\u2019s coffin may not come from you as a puppet, but from your \u2018coffin\u2019 instead.\u201d\u201cThe coffin\u2026 You mean my box?\u201d Alice\u2019s eyes slowly widened, and her gaze subconsciously fell on the wooden box next to the bed with Duncan\u2019s movements. \u201cYou mean\u2026\u201d\u201cThe full name of Anomaly 099 is \u2018Puppet Coffin\u2019\u2026 In other words, you and your wooden box add up to the complete \u2018anomaly 099\u2019. When I first met you, I subconsciously thought that you were the \u2018dominant part\u2019 because I didn\u2019t know the full name,\u201d Duncan rubbed his chin and said while thinking. \u201cNow that I think about it, the main focus of the name actually lied with the second half?\u201dAlice blinked, her head grinding with thought until she facepalmed: \u201cOh! That\u2019s because I came with this box!\u201dDuncan eyed this silly and careless puppet with an exhausted face: \u201c\u2026 You didn\u2019t have to say it so proudly.\u201dAlice didn\u2019t seem to hear the ridicule in Duncan\u2019s tone and glanced down at her wooden box. With a slightly worried voice: \u201cIf this is true\u2026 does that mean my box has been beheading others? But I\u2019ve lived inside it for so long. How come I never felt any sense of danger or evil? I don\u2019t feel any special power while sleeping in it either\u2026.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s obvious. You are part of the entire anomaly 099 package. How are you supposed to reference your own condition with others?\u201d Duncan frowned, \u201cAnd check your neck. I suspect the reason your head keeps popping off is because of you constantly sleeping inside that box!\u201dAlice suddenly felt that the captain was right. With a complicated expression: \u201cBut if what you say is true, why hasn\u2019t my coffin affected anyone aboard the ship yet? Wouldn\u2019t my ability have activated by now?\u201dAs soon as she said this, the lady met Duncan\u2019s gaze and promptly realized she had messed up. Thankfully the doll lived on the ship long enough to know the ghost captain wouldn\u2019t hold it against her, otherwise she might start panicking at this moment.Duncan stared at the doll silently, waiting for Alice to shrink into a smaller mass before faintly saying, \u201cThe only humanoid creature on this ship besides you is me. Do you mean\u2026\u201d\u201cOf course not!\u201d Alice almost jumped and quickly flailed her hand while saying, \u201cIgnore my quibbles, I mean this box\u2026.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t say what I was going to do with you.\u201d Duncan looked at her helplessly, \u201cYou\u2019re now the Vanished\u2019s crew, so I\u2019m your protector on the Boundless Sea. You don\u2019t have to be so afraid. Can you sit properly first? It looks like I\u2019ve done something to you with the way you\u2019re acting.\u201dWhile Alice obeyed and came out of the corner, Duncan, on the other hand, got filled with other thoughts because of the doll\u2019s questions \u2013 like why doesn\u2019t her ability activate after staying on the ship? Considering the amount of time she spent on the Vanished, the cycle of beheading should\u2019ve begun by now, yet the ability appears missing.What was suppressing the doll\u2019s power, the Vanished or the captain himself?Duncan looked down at his hands.He knows that he has a very incredible power, which not only allows him to completely occupy the life of a cultist named \u201cRon\u201d, but even enough to make Alice, an anomaly in the upper rank, to tremble at first glance. Such a magnificent flame yet he still doesn\u2019t fully understand it.On the other hand, the Vanished was the fifth highest vision in the Boundless Sea\u2014a \u201cvision,\u201d not an anomaly.This means that as long as something was within the scope of the ghost ship, there would be a \u201cfield\u201d that\u2019s in effect 24 hours a day, constantly exerting its influence on all targets within the range.With the suppression of the captain + ship, Anomaly 099 would naturally become harmless. However, what if he took Alice to Pland according to plans\u2026. What then? Will the situation spiral out of control?With such a risk, he must figure out a series of things \u2013 is the subject of the effect Alice the doll or her wooden coffin box? Is it the captain himself who\u2019s providing the suppression effect, or is it the ghost ship Vanished who\u2019s causing it? Will the coffin and doll go berserk if separated, or will it absolve the beheading effect entirely?Duncan had a large list of questions in his mind as he contemplated what\u2019s plausible and what\u2019s not. Gradually, various schemes began to formulate in the man\u2019s mind, but at the end of things, he found one thing that frustrated him: he lacked many of the necessary conditions for testing.The Vanished wasn\u2019t a qualified testing ground because the power of the ghost ship interferes with the accuracy of the results. He doesn\u2019t have a suitable test target either aboard.Duncan raised his head and looked at Alice, who was sitting obediently on the edge of the bed\u2014the doll lady was looking at her beloved wooden box with some sadness. It didn\u2019t take much to guess what she thought since all her tangled emotions were printed on that face.As if noticing the captain\u2019s gaze, Alice suddenly broke the silence and whispered, \u201cFrom the day I was conscious\u2026 I\u2019ve been living in this box. It\u2019s my bed, it\u2019s my home, it\u2019s my shelter, and I feel safe when I sleep in it.\u201dDuncan didn\u2019t speak and quietly observed the doll in front of him.\u201cI now know why those humans are so afraid,\u201d Alice reached out and gently stroked her wooden box, \u201cThey\u2019re afraid of us.\u201d\u201cI was planning to take you to the city state of Pland the next time I walked in the spirit world,\u201d Duncan said in a deep voice, \u201cI need a helper over there.\u201dAlice\u2019s eyes seemed to light up for a moment, but then they darkened: \u201cAh, this might not work\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve postponed the plan, but not canceled.\u201d Duncan\u2019s expression and tone didn\u2019t change much, \u201cWe just need more time to confirm\u2026 \u2018your\u2019 power and master the conditions for this \u2018decapitation\u2019 effect. Know that the city-states have the knowledge and means to seal a variety of anomalies through various tricks. If they can do it, we here on the Vanished most certainly can do more.\u201dAlice glanced at Duncan suspiciously. From the captain\u2019s calm and deep gaze, she soon realized that this was not an empty word of comfort.\u201cYou have a plan?\u201dDuncan thought for a moment, raised his fingertips, and lit a cluster of faint flames.\u201cFirst of all, we may need a little fire.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100 \u201cFiction And Reality In History\u201dThis Translation is hosted on https://bcatranslation.com/\u201cCaptain, are you sure this is really okay?\u201d Alice looked nervously at the \u201csmall flame\u201d in Duncan\u2019s finger, causing her two hands to grasp the lace decoration on the side of her clothes, \u201cPlease don\u2019t burn my room down\u2026\u201dDuncan held the ball of fire while looking for a place to start, but at seeing the way Alice was behaving, he sighed and took a moment to explain. \u201cMy ghost fire is completely under my control, don\u2019t you believe me?\u201dWhen Alice heard this, she flailed her hand up in the air: \u201cI believe, I believe\u2026\u201dOnly then did Duncan withdraw his gaze and focus his mind.With the conditions now on the Vanished, it was impossible to fully test Alice\u2019s \u201ccoffin\u201d. However, this does not mean he cannot do some \u201cpreliminary research\u201d first. Now that he has become more adept in the control of the ghost fire, he has vaguely touched upon some doorway to use this to explore the secrets inside supernatural things.He still didn\u2019t dare to use this flame on Alice of course, but if it was to study her wooden box\u2026 that\u2019s another story.After some preparation, Duncan slowly reached out. He extended a cluster of flames from his fingertips to the surface of the ornate box, letting it sink in like some illusory reflection.First it covered the outside, then the inside, followed by the green flame seeping straight into the wood until the very box transformed and reconstructed into its skeletal structure!\u201cAH, Captain, Captain, it\u2019s burning!\u201dThe puppet shouted in amazement, but her cry did draw a response due to Duncan focusing his attention on control. The man kept a firm eye to ensure nothing went wrong at this stage because a part of his consciousness was about to enter the item.Gradually, calm and silence took over the ghost captain\u2019s environment until even the endless sounds of waves and wind disappeared from his ear. His mind entered a vast \u201cplace\u201d unlike anything he had conquered in the past through the channel he created.If he had to coin an analogy, using the flame to control the sun talisman gave him the feeling of easily filling up a cup of water. In this case, with Alice\u2019s coffin, it\u2019s like pouring his mind into a large lake. The volume couldn\u2019t even be compared.Is this the gap difference between an artificially mass-produced supernatural item and an anomaly ranked in the upper numbers?Duncan realized something in his heart, and in this flash of thought, he suddenly sensed the connection of his flames reaching a peak \u2013 the transmission of power became smooth as a river as turbulent \u201cmemories\u201d flooded into his mind!There were sounds of waves battering against unfamiliar coastlines, cold winds blowing against high walls, and the distant and frozen landscapes of shadowy crowds gathering together.Duncan\u2019s vision zipped across the air, flying dozens of meters to take an aerial view of the whole place. From above, he saw a strange and unknown city, and at its center was a stage with crowds of onlookers gathered around it.Duncan also heard numerous whispers and chatters with his ears. It\u2019s noisy and jumbled due to all the voices. However, there\u2019s no question in the ghost captain\u2019s mind that these voices aren\u2019t from the crowds of shadows beneath him but rather an echoing murmur that encompassed the entire city. It gives off an ominous and oppressive vibe.Then suddenly, Duncan jerked to attention at a tension grabbing at his rear. Swinging around, he suddenly found himself standing on the ground, staring at a towering thing in the center.It\u2019s a guillotine\u2014a sharp-bladed instrument for beheading its victims.Through the bit of historical knowledge in his mind, Duncan realized where he must be right now.The Frost Queen, who had been executed by the rebels half a century earlier, was tied and standing before him.She had the exact same fact as Alice\u2026Duncan didn\u2019t know what to make of this. He understood they weren\u2019t the same people, only in appearance, yet he felt ill watching this picture knowing what was to come.\u201cYour time is up, Frost Queen.\u201d The cold and distant voice yells out from behind the stage as if raising the curtain to the show.In the next second, Duncan saw two phantoms rapidly appear next to the guillotine. The two shadows came to the Frost Queen in an attempt to bend her knee. Yet, the queen\u2019s figure did not move like the two phantoms were weak children.Now the jumbled noise around the stage grew even louder and more turbulent, followed by the crowds of shadows swaying like they were upset at the outcome.\u201cQUIET!!\u201d The same cold voice that yelled before spoke again, this time more enraged than commanding. \u201cMAINTAIN ORDER IN THE EXECUTION GROUND!!!\u201dMore phantoms emerged around the guillotine. They forced the Frost Queen to bend her knee and lock into that cold torturous apparatus this time. With this, the cold glistening blade of sharp death began to rise as the locks and cogs turned.Duncan frowned. Although he knew this was just an echoing memory, he still subconsciously took a step forward when looking at the face of \u201cAlice\u201d\u2026But it\u2019s with this gesture that the Frost Queen turned her head slightly. She\u2019s looking straight at the ghost captain as if they\u2019re acting in the same time and space.\u201cWhoever you are, please don\u2019t pollute history.\u201d The queen says softly but with power.Duncan stood frozen in amazement and heard even more shocked outcries from around the guillotine, \u201cWho are you talking to?!\u201dThe Frost Queen had already retracted her gaze then, returning to her cold demeanor. \u201cDo it before the sun sets.\u201dThe guillotine blade fell with that sentence.Instantly, boundless darkness surged from all directions, tearing apart the illusion that had replayed the historical event in detail. Duncan knew what was happening with this past echo, and sure enough, his connection \u201chere\u201d was rapidly fading. But even so, his ears could still grasp onto a few vague and broken sentences at the end.\u201c\u2026\u2026 The Frost Queen is dead, and we have cut off the channel for the Vanished to return to the real world\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 Ray Nora vainly tried to build the second Vanished\u2026 She colluded with the shadow of subspace. The evidence is conclusive, so her death is well deserved\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 The new administrator will soon restore order, and all materials related to the \u2018Abyss\u2019 exploration plan will be destroyed\u2026 However, active whistleblowers still have a chance to be forgiven\u2026\u201d\u201cFull pursuit of the rebel ship Sea Mist and the defecting navy\u2026 Dead or alive doesn\u2019t matter\u2026 Wait, what is that sound\u2026 Quickly run. This place is going to collapse!\u201dExclamations, shouts, the sound of buildings collapsing in the surroundings, and the roaring waves rocked his ears\u2026.In that moment, Duncan abruptly broke out of the boundless darkness like someone desperately surfacing from a deep dive. The last connection had snapped, signaling the end of the historic show and his return to reality.Opening his eyes, Duncan\u2019s first sight was Alice plucking her head off and snapping it back on for fun: \u201c\u2026?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
