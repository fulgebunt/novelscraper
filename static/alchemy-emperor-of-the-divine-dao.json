The moon has passed the middle of the night sky.Ling Han spent exactly ten seconds to confirm one fact: he truly had been reincarnated.Spending ten seconds just to confirm a fact was extremely inconceivable to a strong person from the Heaven Tier, but at the same time, it also proved that what had happened to him was just as inconceivable.In his previous life, he stood at the summit of martial arts and had completely unprecedented achievements in the art of alchemy. The \"Three Fire Guide\" that he had invented had even caused a revolution in the field of theory of alchemy, and he was respectfully titled \"Alchemy Emperor\".Still, he was unsatisfied and thought of further advancement: to reach the legendary Shattering Void Tier, to shatter the void, and become immortal! As such, he visited innumerable ancient sites and finally entered Black Blood Valley, overcoming various dangerous obstacles before he discovered an ancient tower.He was not to be disappointed, for golden words appeared on the ancient tower and revealed what was a scroll with supreme skills, named <<Indestructible Heaven Scroll>>. Training in it to the highest level would allow creation of a body that neither ages nor decays, to co-exist with the sky and the earth and to have the same lifespan as the sun and the moon! [1]However, despite being a warrior who has reached the Heaven Tier, Ling Han still felt that <<Indestructible Heaven Scroll>> was extremely obscure and difficult to comprehend, feeling as if he was reading a heavenly book\u2014completely at a loss.He forced himself to memorize this collection of supreme skills, and was just about to investigate the ancient tower when the tower jolted slightly, exuding a pillar of heavenly light that instantly shattered his mortal body. However, the strange thing was, his spirit did not actually disperse and entered a state of semi-consciousness, which lasted for more than ten thousand years.In these ten millennia, his spirit was immersed in analyzing the <<Indestructible Heaven Scroll>>\u2014he couldn't do anything else during that time anyway. Finally, he comprehended the first layer of the supreme skills described in the scroll.To spend ten thousand years to comprehend only the first layer of a scroll containing skills despite being a warrior of the Heaven Tier, what kind of concept was that?A warrior of the Heaven Tier only had the lifespan of less than a thousand years. Thus, in a normal situation, there would be no one in this world that could fully learn the contents of <<Indestructible Heaven Scroll>> because, before one had even started comprehending it, they would die of old age first!Yet Ling Han, through this strange occurrence, grasped the first layer of <<Indestructible Heaven Scroll>>, and he was now suddenly reincarnated and reborn in the body of a sixteen-year-old young man that shared the same name, Ling Han.It was extremely inconceivable!'No matter how it happened, I am reborn!Although this body has only reached the second layer of Body Refining Tier, and couldn't be any more trashy than this, I was once a warrior of the Heaven Tier, standing at the top of Martial Dao, and a grandmaster of Alchemy! If the body's condition is poor, then I shall use medicinal pills to compensate for its shortcomings! I do not believe I will not be able to return to the top.Moreover, I can finally train in the <<Indestructible Heaven Scroll>>! This is a collection of supreme skills, so powerful that\u2026 it may not be from this mortal plane, but from the legendary immortal plane instead! Otherwise, how is it possible for me to spend ten thousand years and only grasp the first layer?In this life, I will definitely be able to exceed all those who came before, and become immortal!Additionally, what is the matter with this body? Sixteen years old, and yet the guy had only reached the second layer of Body Refining Tier? Could it be that the Martial Dao of the current time is dying?'\"Bang!\"Along with an explosion-like sound, uncountable memories flooded his mind. They belonged to the other Ling Han, and thus were the memories of the original owner of this body. Through this process, two completely different minds melded together and formed one, no longer separate from each other.'I see.'Ling Han nodded in his thoughts. The reason why he was only at the second layer of the Body Refining Tier was because his Spirit Base was of a too poor quality.The prerequisite to train as a warrior was that one needed to have a Spirit Base. Only with a Spirit Base could one absorb the Spiritual Qi from heaven and earth, train one's body and transform the Spiritual Qi into their own Origin Power.Some types of Spirit Bases absorb the Spiritual Qi quickly and some absorb it more slowly. To differentiate between them, Spirit Bases were categorized into four major grades: Heaven, Earth, Black and Yellow. Every major grade was further divided into three minor levels: High, Medium and Low. The best type was the Heaven Grade High Level, and the poorest type was the Yellow Grade Low Level.The grade of Spirit Base was decided by its purity; the purer it was, the better. Ling Han's Spirit Base was in utter disarray, containing all five elements. In the world of martial arts, this was the worst type of Spirit Base; it could barely be considered Yellow Grade Low Level. It was the reason why he had only reached the second layer of Body Refining Tier at his age of sixteen, while others of the same age had at least reached the fourth or fifth layer of Body Refining Tier.Ling Han in his previous life possessed a Heaven Grade Spirit Base, which was also a High Level one: the Nine Yang Fire Spirit Base. In addition to that, he had an incomparable talent in the art of alchemy and used pills to support his cultivation, spending only two hundred years to reach the Heaven Tier\u2014something never achieved by anyone else in the past.'Five Elements Disarray Spirit Base, this is the lowest level of a Spirit Base... no wonder my predecessor only reached the second layer of Body Refining Tier no matter how much he worked and trained. To me, this Five Elements Disarray Spirit Base is a bit of a problem, but with alchemical pills, I will need only four years to return to the top at most!''Yi!'Ling Han exclaimed in his heart, and his face showed an expression of disbelief and utmost surprise. Using his extremely strong mental prowess to once again peer at the Spirit Base in his Dantian, he was stunned for a moment. Then, shock gave way to exuberant joy, showing on his face. [2]'This isn't the Five Elements Disarray Spirit Base! The Five Elements are actually in complete balance and form the shape of a lotus! That means... this is the Five Elements Mix Chaos Lotus, the best of the best, even rarer than the Nine Yang Fire Spirit Base! This is the Spirit Base hailed as the Spirit Base of the Immortal Grade!My predecessor had slow progress, but it was because Immortal Grade Spirit Base requires specialized skills to realize its true prowess. And\u2026 it just so happens that I have hold of skills that suit this Five Elements Mix Chaos Lotus, the Five Elements Heaven Grade Skill!One hundred years! No, I only need fifty years, and I can once again reach the Heaven Tier!'Even with his status as a warrior of the Heaven Tier from his previous life, Ling Han couldn't control his expression, now full of joy. The Spirit Base was something one was born with; there was no way to change it at all. In his previous life, to shatter the empty void and become immortal, he had visited various ancient sites and obtained many different types of secret arts and cultivation techniques. The Five Elements Heaven Grade Skill was one of them!In his previous life, he stood at the top of the martial world, and in this life, he would once again bask in glory and create an undying legend!'How did my predecessor die?'Ling Han flipped through his memories, and anger quickly appeared on his face.His predecessor was the only son of the Ling Clan's Head, Ling Dong Xing. His mother and grandparents had all passed away very early on. The Ling Clan was a clan of martial artists; every clan member knew martial arts, and was proud of the fact. So, how did someone like Ling Dong Xing become the Clan Head? That was because he was the strongest and had reached his position through battling!But Ling Han was regarded as trash since his childhood because of the issue with his Spirit Base, and had received much ridicule from those around him.To give his son a bright future, Ling Dong Xing made an agreement with Hu Yang Academy\u2014Hu Yang Academy would receive Lign Han as a disciple and put all efforts into training him in exchange for Ling Dong Xing entering Purple Light Ground Valley to find and retrieve something Hu Yang Academy had lost many years ago.Hu Yang Academy was an academy under the jurisdiction of the Imperial Dynasty of the Rain Country, possessing uncountable resources. If they decided to put all effort into training him, even the worst kind of trash would be able to reach Element Gathering Tier.But the people from Hu Yang Academy were not idiots. If that item was easily retrievable, then why would they have given such generous conditions?Purple Light Ground Valley was a place fraught with danger. One wrong step could lead to death, but since it was for his son's sake, Ling Dong Xing departed seven days ago without hesitation.The day before, people from Hu Yang Academy had come and informed the Ling Clan that, as promised, they would come to pick him up on this day. Yet at that moment, the Chief Butler of Ling Clan, Ling Zhong Kuan, had come to talk with his predecessor. He wanted him to give up this precious position to his own grandson, Ling Mu Yun.The reason provided was that Ling Mu Yun was a genius with boundless prospects, and such an opportunity couldn't be wasted on trash.His predecessor of course did not agree. After all, this was something his father had used his life in exchange to obtain! However, although Ling Zhong Kuan come to talk, he was actually only informing his predecessor and didn't come there to listen to the other's opinion at all.His predecessor could no longer endure and acted, but Ling Zhong Kuan was a warrior of the Element Gathering Tier. Just one finger was enough to overwhelm him\u2014how could he resist?With just one punch, his predecessor was seriously wounded, and was subsequently confined in his own room, obviously not to let him create an issue in front of the people from Hu Yang Academy. Once Ling Dong Xing returns, everything would have already been concluded.The seriously wounded Ling Han thus died in anger.Ling Han harrumphed. They have gone too far. His father used his life to obtain this position for him, and Ling Zhong Kuan and his grandson dare to snatch it away just like that?These extremely shameless dogs!He couldn't accept this!He rose up from his bed, and instantly felt ache throughout his whole body\u2014true, he had obtained a new life, but the injuries on his body would not recover on their own.'En? The Spirit Base has been damaged!' Ling Han's brow wrinkled. That attack from Ling Zhong Kuan had actually damaged his Spirit Base, and damage to the Spirit Base was a very troublesome issue; ordinary medical stones would be of no help.'According to my understanding, there are seven types of pills that can heal damage to the Spirit Base, though four of them require ingredients that are so expensive that even selling the whole Ling Clan would not be enough\u2014moreover, my Spirit Base had only received light damage, and thus does not require such high-grade pills.As for the remaining three types, two of them require molding to form pills, and that would be too much of a burden at my current cultivation of second layer of Body Refining Tier. If that's so, then I only have one choice - Origin Heart Recover Spirit Powder, which can be created by simply mixing the required ingredients at the correct ratio and cooking them to become a medical concoction.I will heal my injuries first, and then go and stop Ling Zhong Kuan and his grandson. Although I do not care about this position, I will definitely not allow the opportunity that my father has traded his life for to be used to benefit this shameless grandfather-grandson pair!'He sat down with his legs crossed, and started circulating Indestructible Heaven Scroll. [3]This was his first time circulating this cultivation technique which might have been of the Immortal Grade, but because he has analyzed it for ten thousand years, it now was something that could be done easily.\"Weng, weng, weng!\" Powerful life signs appeared suddenly inside his body; his Origin Power was greatly depleted, but his injuries were quickly healing.Within just a few minutes, he was fully recovered.'It is worthy of the name \"Indestructible Heaven Scroll\"! I have only just started training in it, and have already felt such remarkable effects.Yet this is completely different from other types of cultivation techniques; ordinary cultivation techniques make use of the Spirit Base to absorb Spiritual Qi from the sky and the earth to transform into Origin Power, and Indestructible Heaven Scroll is the exact opposite, using Origin Power to refine the body and heal injuries!Once my training reaches the highest level, achieving immortality may not be impossible. That is why it is called Heaven Scroll! Unfortunately, the level now is not enough, otherwise I could use Indestructible Heaven Scroll to heal my Spirit Base.'Ling Han opened his eyes and, looking at the growing light outside his window, murmured softly: \"Now, I shall go and meet with Ling Zhong Kuan, that shameless old man, and give him a surprise!\"He put on his shoes, walked towards the doorway and opened the door.In the doorway was a tall figure, blocking his advance. This man's name was Zhang Yuan, one of Ling Zhong Kuan's lackeys.\"Young Master Han, Chief Butler has commanded that you have to stay in your room today!\" Zhang Yun said with a laugh. Although the person in front of him was the son the Clan Head, he was also a notorious piece of trash, and just a joke in his eyes.Ling Han's gaze grew cold, and said, \"You dare hinder me?\"It was exactly that. The Chief Butler had told him that he couldn't allow Ling Han to come out and get in their way at all costs. If things come to head, he even had the permission to attack him! Thus, Zhang Yun smiled falsely and said, \"This is a command from the Chief Butler. Young Master Han, please do not make things difficult for me.\"'Ling Zhong Kuan, this old dog, is truly cautious; he has seriously wounded me and still feels insecure, going so far as to assign someone to guard the door,' Ling Han thought. This also showed how important it was to Ling Zhong Kuan for his grandson to enter Hu Yang Academy\u2014if this hope was shattered, Ling Zhong Kuan's despair and fury could be imagined.\"Get out of my way!\" Ling Han spoke coldly.\"Young Master Han, this was ordered by the Chief But-\"\"Pa!\"Ling Han raised his hand and gave him a slap, speaking coldly, \"What are you doing? I told you to get out of my way, and you don't?\"What, he had actually received a slap from a piece of trash? Zhang Yuan covered his face in disbelief; this piece of trash actually dared to resist him, what kind of joke was this?He was furious, and recalled Ling Zhong Kuan's words from before: if things come to head, he had permission to attack! He could not stop his hate from rising, and said thickly, \"Young Master Han, this is what you have forced me to-\"\"Pa!\"Ling Han raised his hand once more, and gave him another solid slap.[1] ED/N: Probably referring to a scroll made of bamboo slips.[2] ED/N: Dantian refers to Sea of Qi or similar entity. Believed to be located in the pubic region inside one's body, it's a key organ related to cultivating Qi. It is also important in Traditional Chinese Medicine, mainly in reference to Qi.[3] ED/N: Yes, the same name, but this time as a cultivation technique.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 2": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Alchemy Emperor of the Divine DaoCH 2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZhang Yuan was about to go crazy. He had actually received two slaps from a piece of trash! In his fury, he did not consider how a piece of trash at only second layer of Body Refining Tier could slap someone at fourth layer of Body Refining Tier twice. Opening his mouth to release a great roar, he pounced at Ling Han.There was only one thought in his head now, and that was to ruthlessly beat up this piece of trash!His one punch was filled with great power, bringing with it a slight breeze as it headed towards his target.Ling Han was oddly calm and immobile. In his previous life, he could naturally get rid of ten thousand of Zhang Yuan with a flick of his fingers, but now he only had the power of the second layer of Body Refining Tier.The difference in strength was a bit problematic, but that was it. The one controlling this body was, after all, a former warrior of the Heaven Tier! His strength may have been lost, but his insight remained!Zhang Yuan only needed to raise his hand or move his leg, and Ling Han would be able to deduce where his punch would be heading towards and where his feet would be moving to. As a result, by the time Zhang Yuan's punch flew out, Ling Han had already reacted.\"Hu!\"The fist had hit its target and Zhang Yuan revealed a cold grin. Once hit with his punch, its overwhelming power would instantly cause Ling Han to lose all means of resistance, leaving him completely at his opponent's mercy.He had hit his target!\"En?\"Zhang Yuan's face revealed his surprise; although his punch appeared to have hit Ling Han's face, it had actually missed by a slight margin\u2014Ling Han managed to take a step back in time and just barely managed to dodge his fist.His fist stopped exactly in front of the tip of Ling Han's nose. It was almost touching it, so perfectly calculated as if he had used a ruler to carefully measure the distance.'It must be a coincidence,' Zhang Yuan thought in his heart.And it was at this moment that Ling Han's palm once more flew towards him.\"Pa!\" A loud, crisp noise was heard, and Zhang Yuan received another solid slap.\"Damn it!\" Zhang Yuan spat out a mouthful of spit, let out a loud shout, and once again launched his fist, punching towards Ling Han.\"Hu!\" Zhang Yuan's fist once again missed. It was as if Ling Han moved at the same moment as his upper body flew backwards! Using both hands to push himself off the ground, his right foot automatically kicked out, hitting the spot in between Zhang Yuan's legs with a soft sound.\"Ao-!\" Even if his cultivation was at the fourth layer of Body Refining Tier, it didn't matter\u2014he would still be unable to have the ability \"iron balls\", and this kick had hit its target solidly. Zhang Yuan suddenly dropped down onto his knees, both hands gripping his crotch as large droplets of cold sweat appeared on his face.\"You're so treacherous!\" Zhang Yuan twitched, his whole face was so twisted it looked inhuman.\"Pa!\"Ling Han once again gave him a slap. Zhang Yuan's mouth opened, and spat out a few broken teeth. Ling Han naturally had no sympathy for him, and said, \"A dog will always be a dog; as expected, it would not be able to spit out ivory.\" [1]Zhang Yuan was extremely furious. He had actually been made to kneel on the ground and received a violent slap from someone at the second layer of Body Refining Tier... what kind of humiliation was this? He wanted to counterattack, but the kick that his privates received had directly removed all his power to resist. Every move he took made his balls hurt in agony.But he definitely couldn't allow Ling Han to ruin Ling Zhong Kuan's important business. Otherwise, if he couldn't complete the task that the other had assigned him\u2026 going by Ling Zhong Kuan's character, he would definitely be killed.\"Han, Young Master Han, listen to me, you can't leave this place. Actually, you have been poisoned, once you leave this room, you will die of poison,\" his thoughts were anxious so he tried to quickly think of something that would make Ling Han stay here.Ling Han could not help but smile. Did he think that this kind of terrible acting would be able to deceive him? He flew up and kicked Zhang Yuan away. He didn't have any free time to waste on this lackey, he had to stop Ling Zhong Kuan's evil scheme from succeeding instead. Otherwise, his father would have risked his life only to benefit others.As for Zhang Yuan? Ling Han naturally would not take this kind of minor character into consideration. After all, Ling Zhong Kuan only needed to see him appear, and would naturally come to deal with Zhang Yuan. He had no need to dirty his own hands.\"Don't go! Don't go!\" Zhang Yuan's sobs and pleas spread out from behind him. It was as if he could already see his own miserable end.Accomplice to a villain, he only had himself to blame, and didn't deserve the slightest bit of sympathy.Ling Han strode forwards. After a few minutes, he arrived at the inner doorway to the living room. He hadn't stepped in yet but already could hear a loud, aged voice: \"Miss Liu, please, please!\"The living room had an inner and outer doorway. The inner doorway was connected to the inner court, while the outer doorway would lead to the main door. Looking out through the curtains, he could see a group of five walking in. The group comprised of five people: four male, one female.Aside from the young woman, Ling Han could recognize the four men. They were all Ling Clan clansmen. One of them was an elderly man, the Chief Butler, Ling Zhong Kuan. Two of the other three were middle-aged men of around forty years, both Ling Zhong Kuan's sons. The last one was a young man, older than Ling Han by about one or two years, and that was none other than Ling Zhong Kuan's eldest grandson, Ling Mu Yuan.Ling Han looked towards the only female in the group. Even with his eyesight from his previous life as one at the Heaven Tier, his eyes brightened. This young woman was truly beautiful. Her looks were like autumn, her skin as fair as the moon. She seemed to be only seventeen or eighteen, but already possessed an elegant demeanor and beauty that could bring disaster to country and people.It was just that her aura was as cold as if she was an icy mountain, driving away any who dared to approach.This young girl would certainly be the person sent by Hu Yang Academy, what a coincidence.\"En?\"Ling Han's eyes widened slightly. He had discovered something even more coincidental, and his lips couldn't help but reveal a smile.Both parties sat separately in their positions as guest and host. A few maidservants came forwards to serve fragrant tea and stood respectfully at the sides of the five people's seats.\"Has the person from the Ling Clan that you are sending to the academy gotten ready?\" Liu Yu Tong opened her mouth and spoke, her voice both cold and melodious, with a bit of disdain. What she hated the most were people who would enter the academy through the back door. Although she was commanded to come here, she had no good feelings towards this future younger brother disciple.\"Ready, ready!\" Ling Zhong Kuan hurriedly spoke. Although he was old enough to be the young girl's grandfather, both parties were of the same level, Element Gathering Tier.One's skill in martial arts did not depend on age. Only the strong would be respected.Ling Zhong Kuan even had a feeling that this young girl's level was slightly higher than his own - he was at the sixth layer of Element Gathering Tier, while this girl could be of the seventh layer, or maybe even eighth.This also caused him to be even more eager to send his own grandson to Hu Yang Academy. In a few years, he would be of an even higher level than Ling Dong Xing and help him snatch the position of the Clan Head.\"Mu Yun, quickly come and greet your Elder Sister Disciple Liu!\" The old man turned and spoke to Ling Mu Yuan.\"Yes, grandfather!\" Ling Mu Yun spoke with great respect. Cupping his hands in Liu Yu Tong's direction, he said, \"Mu Yun greets Elder Sister Disciple Liu!\" There was heat in his gaze. He felt wild ambition when looking upon this cold, beautiful and incomparably strong beauty.He believed that, with enough time spent together, he would be able to capture the heart of the beauty.Liu Yu Tong was slightly surprised. She recalled that the person from Ling Clan she was to escort was named Ling Han. However, it was none of her business. She was only responsible for bringing a person from the Ling Clan back to the academy.\"Since you're ready, then let's depart,\" she said calmly.\"Miss Liu, why don't you stay for a few days in our humble abode, so that we can express a small bit of our gratitude?\" Ling Zhong Kuan hurriedly said. He wanted to get close to this young girl, and in the future, she would also be able to take care of his grandson.\"No need!\" Liu Yu Tong rejected coldly, turned and was about to leave.\"Please wait!\" a voice was heard, and Ling Han strode out.The faces of Ling Zhong Kuan and his group changed slightly. However much they looked down on this piece of trash of the Ling Clan, they were the thieves right now... and thieves would naturally feel guilty.\"Younger Brother Han, weren't you injured? Return quickly to your room to rest,\" Ling Mu Yun reacted the quickest. He shot forwards and reached Ling Han's side, extending his hand. He wanted to fall upon Ling Han at the first moment, without giving the other any opportunity to open his mouth.He was at the seventh layer of Body Refining Tier, and his strength was not something Zhang Yuan could compare to.[1] ED/N: it's a reference to a Chinese idiom: no ivory comes from the mouth of a dog (\u72d7\u5634\u91cc\u5410\u4e0d\u51fa\u8c61\u7259), meaning \"no good words are to be expected from a scoundrel\".Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 3": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Alchemy Emperor of the Divine DaoCH 3Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThere were altogether nine layers of the Body Refining Tier. The first to third layers were usually called the early stage of Body Refining Tier, fourth to sixth levels were the middle stage, and seventh to ninth levels were the late stage. Martial artists from three different stages had a great disparity in their strength.And the higher the layer, the larger the disparity was. A martial artist at the ninth layer facing a martial artist at the eighth layer would have an overwhelming advantage. However, a martial artist at the first layer of Body Refining Tier against a martial artist from the second layer would not be at such a large disadvantage.Previously, Ling Han seemed to be only two layers below Zhang Yuan, but there was a major disparity of one stage between them. However, Ling Mu Yun was at the seventh layer of Body Refining Tier, and was of the late stage of Body Refining Tier\u2014higher than Ling Han by two stages.This was an unbreachable gap. Even if Ling Han had once been one of the strongest Heaven Tier warriors, he would still be unable to breach this huge difference in ability. After all, the base he had now was too low.So what to do?Ling Han's eyes grew serious, and taking advantage of the moment the other's palm was heading towards him, he suddenly raised his fist in an attack.Ling Mu Yun could not help showing an expression of ridicule. Although he didn't know how Ling Han managed to come here, he was a well-known piece of trash amongst the whole of Ling Clan. What kind of threat could he be to himself?He circulated Origin Power, and his chest muscles hardened, becoming as dense as iron. So what if he received a hit from Ling Han? The important thing now was to restrict Ling Han and not allow him the chance to open his mouth.Sure enough.The corners of Ling Han's mouth curved in a slight smile. The other's reaction was completely within his expectations. 'You're about to suffer this time!'\"Peng!\" Because Ling Mu Yun did not make any move to dodge, this sudden punch hit its target solidly.Ling Mu Yun still looked disdainful as he extended his hand and placed it on Ling Han's shoulder. \"Young Brother Han, I'll send you back-\" he hadn't finished speaking before he spat out a mouthful of blood. This wasn't even the end. He felt his chest was boiling, as if he was about to throw up all his internal organs.He suddenly fell and sat down on the ground, his expression extremely ugly.\"Teng, teng, teng,\" Ling Han retreated a total of seven steps. He stopped once his back met the wall behind him.What was this?Ling Han had used a special technique in that punch. Its name was \"Hill Separating Shock\". It allowed power to pass through the opponent's defenses before exploding, which was why although Ling Mu Yun had used Origin Power to defend, Ling Han's power still managed to pass through his muscles and explode inside his body. Naturally, it became an extremely heavy blow to Ling Mu Yun.This was also thanks to the fact that Ling Mu Yun was at the seventh layer of Body Refining Tier. Otherwise, he would have been seriously injured by this punch. Even death would not be an impossibility.To look down upon one of the strongest of the Heaven Tier warriors was to bring trouble onto oneself.Still, seventh layer of Body Refining Tier was still seventh layer of Body Refining Tier. The rebound of Origin Power was still far from what Ling Han could handle. Thus, he too had been jarred to the point that he staggered and retreated. Due to the shock of power, his right arm was suddenly dislocated.\"Ka!\" Ling Han did not even wrinkle his brow and used his left hand to twist his right arm back into position.It wasn't until that moment that Ling Zhong Kuan and his group finally reacted. They were all angered and shocked. Their anger was because Ling Han had actually wounded Ling Mu Yun, while their shock was because they were wondering: how had this piece of trash managed to accomplish such a feat?Meanwhile, the few maidservants were even more dumbfounded\u2014was this still the Young Master Han they knew? How could he be so fierce that, with one punch, he had injured Young Master Mu Yun, who has always been known as a genius, to the point that the latter was throwing up blood!\"Little beast, how dare you be so ruthless!\" Ling Zhong Kuan immediately shouted. \"Mu Yun was only worried about you and wanted to send you back to your room, yet you did something so ruthless, you crazy dog!\"He sure was sly, immediately making a verbal counter-attack through false accusation.Ling Mu Yun too regained his breath. When his eyes fell upon Ling Han, they were filled with murder\u2014he was the genius of the Ling Clan, and yet he was actually injured by a piece of trash. How could his ego accept such a blow?Ling Han completely ignored the two, and instead looked at Liu Yu Tong. \"Miss, you're sick!\"This!Ling Zhong Kuan was about to make a move, but when he heard these words, he forcefully held back.The other was a student from Hu Yang Academy, and Hu Yang Academy was established by the Imperial Family of Rain Country. Those who managed to enroll there would definitely have come from a strong, huge background, and would be something that far exceed the background of a person at Element Gathering Tier.However, Ling Han actually said that the other was sick... was he seeking death?'Very good, now implicate Ling Dong Xing too,' Chief Butler thought. Someone would do his dirty work for him and he would be able to easily take the position of Clan Head. 'Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful! Ling Dong Xing, ah, Ling Dong Xing, you would never have thought that your son is not only a piece of trash, but also someone who will ruin you!'When Liu Yu Tong looked at Ling Han, her eyes revealed slight disgust.She was born very beautiful, and was also the princess of one of the Eight Great Clans of the Imperial City, the Liu Clan. The Liu Clan was an existence that was only below the Imperial Family in status\u2014and naturally, she did not lack any number of young men who tried to ingratiate themselves with her. Some would even try the opposite, pretending to be cold to attract her interest.She naturally thought that Ling Han was the same sort of pest, only that he was using the method of \"cursing\" her... This was the first time that she had encountered this tactic, but this did not give her any feeling of novelty, only disgust.\"How dare you!\" Ling Zhong Kuan was an observant man, and shouted in a timely manner, \"Kneel down quickly and apologize to Miss Liu!\"Ling Han gave a calm smile. \"In this world, aside from my parents, I will kneel down to no one!\" Looking at Liu Yu Tong, he walked towards her. He stopped once he was about three steps away.That was because he knew this was the limit of the other's patience. If he went any closer, she would definitely take action.He didn't want to be hit one bit.\"Since you were ten, have you been fainting every year for no reason? In the beginning, it was once a year, but it has become more and more frequent. At present, you should be fainting once every ten days,\" Ling Han spoke with a lowered voice, only allowing Liu Yu Tong alone to hear his words.Liu Yu Tong's expression changed. This illness of hers was only known to a few select people, even in the Liu Clan. How did Ling Han manage to find out about it? She couldn't refrain from once again sizing up Ling Han as she asked, \"You know the reason?\"\"Naturally!\" Ling Han proudly nodded. Otherwise, he would not speak such shocking words. \"It's Three Yin Vanishing Veins. It's a kind of curse from the gods. Those who possess the Three Yin Vanishing Veins would usually only be able to live until twenty. That's because during your twentieth year, you will once again fall unconscious, forever unable to regain consciousness.\"Liu Yu Tong was silent, but she believed Ling Han's words because after her symptoms became more and more serious, her family had brought her to visit many famous doctors. However, every doctor she visited could not do anything, and didn't even know the name of the illness. Still, one of them deduced that she would faint more and more frequently and, one day, she would no longer wake up.Now, she had finally found out what illness she had, but what of it? All the famous doctors in Rain Country could not do anything, so she naturally would not think that Ling Han had any way to help.\"I can heal you,\" Ling Han said at that very moment.Liu Yu Tong's heart trembled, but her face did not reveal anything. \"If you can heal me, I can allow you to become a court official, or even let you have uncountable resources for cultivation.\"Ling Han mustered a smile. \"There is only one way to heal the Three Yin Vanishing Veins, and that is to train in Three Yin Mysterious Arts, and it just so happens that I know this art. I can teach you, but there is one condition\u2014you have to become my follower.\"Liu Yu Tong could not restrain anger in her heart. She was the princess of the Liu Clan, and was also a genius in martial arts. At the age of seventeen, she had already reached the eighth layer of Element Gathering Tier. And now a puny little martial artist at second layer of Body Refining Tier actually wanted to take her in as a follower? Where did he get his confidence and boldness from?\"Don't feel wronged, because I can give you a wider horizon. I can let you rise to a higher level in martial arts. The Seven Great Vanishing Lands, the Four Great Dead Valleys, the Three Great Bottomless Oceans, have you seen them before?\" Ling Han's sweet temptation followed. Although the Three Yin Vanishing Veins were a curse in nature, there was always hope in every situation. Their owner would also usually possess a Heaven Grade Spirit Base. Once trained in Three Yin Mysterious Arts, the owner would naturally soar.Liu Yu Tong could not stop eagerness from rising within her heart. She had a passionate desire to pursue martial arts, and it was the focus of everything in her life.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 4": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Alchemy Emperor of the Divine DaoCH 4Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLiu Yu Tong was affected in her heart, but to agree to become Ling Han's follower was an impossible request. Biting her red lips slightly, she spoke, \"Change your condition!\"Ling Han smiled slightly. \"You should be at the top of the eighth layer of Element Gathering Tier, right? I'll gift you two verbal chants to show my sincerity: Three Yin Supporting Element, Plan of Square Path, Three Flowers Assemble at the Apex, Shattering the Approach of Heaven!\"At first, Liu Yu Tong was not concerned. This brat was only at the second layer of Body Refining Tier, what kind of shocking verbal chant could he know? He was most likely only pretending to be mysterious. But when she heard these two verbal chants, the Origin Energy within her body began to stir without reason, as if the door to the ninth level of Element Gathering Tier was opening!She was moved. Although she knew that she would be able to break through to the ninth level of Element Gathering Tier, but the estimated time should be around a month later. However, she had a strong feeling that now she only needed about a day, no... even right at this moment, she could enter seclusion and proceed to break through!This was too much; it was just two verbal chants, and yet they had so much effect on her!\"Those were two verbal chants from Three Yin Mysterious Art. How is it?\" Ling Han smiled. Consecutively, he raised his voice and said, \"Become my follower, and I will teach you supreme godly skills!\"\"Pu!\"Ling Zhong Kuan and group puffed, unable to hold back their hearty laughter any longer.What could be more hilarious than this? Just a piece of trash, and he wanted to have a genius from Hu Yang Academy become his follower? And even said he would teach her supreme godly skills! Such bragging skills and guts were truly remarkable, and probably the only things supreme and godly amongst his skills.The idiot had no measure of his own ability; it was such a joke!The maidservants covered their small mouths. They too knew Ling Han's background and, looking at the attitude that Ling Zhong Kuan displayed towards Liu Yu Tong, knew of how noble a status this young girl was.Liu Yu Tong's expression turned cold, and suddenly she had arrived in front of Ling Han. Her right hand flashed out and held his neck. \"Recite Three Yin Mysterious Arts, or else I will kill you!\" She coldly said.Since Ling Han dared to ask such a thing from Liu Yu Tong, he naturally foresaw such a reaction from her, so he only smiled and said, \"Then kill me, I wouldn't need to wait too long before I see you on the path to the Netherworld. We can be travel companions at that time!\"Liu Yu Tong's hold tightened. Although her five fingers looked small and smooth, but at this moment, they seemed like iron claws, strangling Ling Han to the point of suffocation. Soon, his face turned red, and his eyes became bloodshot. Ling Han's four limbs started to twitch violently.Ling Zhong Kuan and his companions had no intention of interfering. In fact, their deepest hope was to have Liu Yu Tong kill Ling Han.\"Are you going to say it or not?\" Liu Yu Tong slightly loosened her grip.Ling Han forced out a smile, and shook his head determinedly.The current Ling Clan was an extremely dangerous place to him. He had to find a strong bodyguard, and would not agree to whatever else Liu Yu Tong suggested to him. He had to make her his protector.What he lacked now was time. As long as he had the time he needed to become stronger, what did a mere Ling Clan count as?Liu Yu Tong once again tightened her grip, and Ling Han's body started to twitch violently before his four limbs suddenly drooped. There was no more movement.'How stubborn!'Liu Yu Tong sighed internally, and her Origin Power rushed out and restarted Ling Han's heartbeat. Exhaling, Ling Han once again opened his eyes, and took in large mouthfuls of air.\"Three years!\" Liu Yu Tong said, \"No more than three years, and within these three years, I will obey your commands!\" Three years later, she would be twenty years old. If she would not lose consciousness and no longer awaken, then she would be completely free.\"Pu!\" Ling Zhong Kuan and his group once again made a snort-like sound with their mouths; but this time, it was because of their great shock. They were completely at a loss.Was there some problem with their hearing? They seemed to have heard Liu Yu Tong assent? Assent to become Ling Han's follower? To become an underling of a piece of trash?This, this, this, they must have heard wrongly! Definitely so!Ling Han came back to attention and smiled, before raising his hand. \"Deal!\" Three years would be long enough for him to mature. At least, it would be long enough for him to rise above the level of Ling Zhong Kuan and his groupies. He would no longer have to worry about any threat to his life.\"Pa!\"Liu Yu Tong extended her hand as well, and joined it with his upraised palm. This was a promise between martial artists.What a delicate hand!When their palms were joined together, Ling Han could not help but feel his heart stir. Although he was once a strong warrior of the Heaven Tier, and furthermore, the Alchemy Emperor, and there were uncountable beautiful women who threw themselves at him in his previous life, since his soul had melded with his predecessor's, it was as if he too had returned to a youthful, impulsive age. The passion that he had not experienced for a long time was burning inside his body, making him feel as if he truly had returned to the age of sixteen years old.Ling Han enjoyed this kind of change. This was what living meant.\"Miss Liu, don't listen to the nonsense this little beast is spouting, let's return to discussing official matters,\" Ling Zhong Kuan interrupted. He didn't want Ling Han to continue making mess out of things. And that Zhang Yuan, he truly was an idiot. He couldn't even keep proper watch over a piece of trash! Once he returned, he'd make sure to kill him!\"Chief Butler,\" Ling Han coldly looked at him, \"This position in Hu Yang Academy is what my father risked his own life to obtain. Now my father is risking his life in Purple Light Ground Valley, and yet you shamelessly attempt to snatch this position. Don't you feel your face burning?\"\"Impudence, how dare you speak to me this way?\" Ling Zhong Kuan suddenly shouted.Liu Yu Tong previously did not bother about such a matter, but since she now had a deal with Ling Han, her attitude naturally changed. \"Butler Ling, what is going on here? I need an explanation!\"Ling Zhong Kuan could pretend he did not hear Ling Han's words, but he definitely would not be able to do the same with Liu Yu Tong's words.Not only was she the representative of Hu Yang Academ, her own ability was above his. What right did he have to ignore Liu Yu Tong's words?He hurriedly said, \"It's like this, this boy is the son of Ling Clan Head, Ling Dong Xing. Thus, Ling Dong Xing became selfish, and wanted to give this placement privately to this boy. I'm only thinking of the big picture, to make the most out of this precious position!\"\"What grand words, 'thinking of the big picture'!\" Ling Han smiled coldly. \"Ling Zhong Kuan, are you completely without shame? This position was obtained by my father, who is risking his life even now now as we speak. What does it have to do with the clan? Why do you need to concern yourself with it? You only want to give this position to your own grandchild, and in future, when his level exceeds my father's, he would be able to help you seize the position of Clan Head.You want to do such a shameless thing, yet claim to be doing it out of loyalty to the clan, what a shameless dog!\"Having received such a big, hearty scolding from Ling Han, Ling Zhong Kuan was furious to the point that his whole body was trembling. He had even come close to spitting out blood in anger.\"Little beast, how dare you insult me this way?\" Ling Zhong Kuan was filled with wrath.He was actually scolded by a piece of trash. If he could not heavily punish Ling Han, he would definitely be angered to the point of internal injury.Ling Han only calmly smiled, and turned to Liu Yu Tong. \"I have completely zero interest in enrolling at Hu Yang Academy. The agreement about the position is canceled. In exchange, let Hu Yang Academy compensate me with some medicinal potions.\"\"Agreed!\" Liu Yu Tong nodded. To expend all efforts to cultivate an individual student would, in the first place, require a large pool of medicinal potions.\"No!\" Ling Zhong Kuan immediately shouted loudly. \"This position belongs to Mu Yun, none of you can steal it away!\"\"Old dog, is there something wrong with your hearing? This position was obviously obtained by my father, what does it have to do with you?\" Ling Han scoffed. Then he looked at Liu Yu Tong, saying, \"Now, this is my first command for you.\"He paused for a moment before saying, \"Restrain this old dog for me, I want to give a few good slaps to this shameless old bastard!\"Liu Yu Tong only hesitated for a moment before she nodded. \"All right!\"Ling Han had already expressed his sincerity by gifting her two valuable verbal chants. Now, she too had to express her own sincerity.What? Liu Yu Tong truly agreed to become Ling Han's follower?The word \"follower\" seemed grand, but in truth, it was something like an attendant, a servant! A grand genius from Hu Yang Academy actually agreed to become someone else's follower? What was this inconceivable affair?But it was reality. Liu Yu Tong had already stood up, her beautiful eyes focused on Ling Zhong Kuan and a fierce battle spirit exuded from her graceful figure.\"Elder Sister Disciple Liu, don't be deceived by this brat!\" Ling Mu Yun yelled, his face filled with shock. He had no way to accept the fact that a talented, intelligent woman like Liu Yu Tong would actually be deceived by Ling Han's flowery words!Particularly when this stunning beauty was someone he wanted to do his utmost to pursue. Now, it was as if he had eaten ten thousand flies\u2014he felt completely suffocated.\"Are you going to surrender, or will you wait for me to act?\" Liu Yu Tong asked calmly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 5": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Alchemy Emperor of the Divine DaoCH 5Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLiu Yu Tong was absolutely confident. She was at the eight layer of Element Gathering Tier, while Ling Zhong Kuan was only at the sixth layer of Element Gathering Tier. Even though there was only two layers' difference between the two, one was from the late stage of Element Gathering, while the other was only in the middle stage. This was the difference of a major level.Ling Zhong Kuan was both shocked and angered. \"Miss Liu, are you really going to help this little beast?\"\"Old dog, watch what you say,\" Ling Han said unhurriedly from the side.These words completely infuriated Ling Zhong Kuan and his companions. You keep saying old dog this, old dog that, and yet you want others to watch their mouths? So the magistrate is free to burn down houses, yet the commoners are forbidden to even light lamps?Too overbearing!Ling Han smiled calmly. He was overbearing, but what of it? In his previous life, he was famous for sweeping his mistakes under the rug and helping those close to him no matter whether they were in the right or in the wrong. In front of outsiders, he would defend his people. Whoever was in the right or in the wrong, he'd discuss that behind closed doors later.Ling Zhong Kuan, his sons and grandson had gone much too far. With his personality, it'd be strange if he could tolerate such a thing.Liu Yu Tong did not respond. Her graceful figure flew out as if she was a goddess from heaven, both hands pressing onto Ling Zhong Kuan, without any ferocity and displaying a sense of unworldly beauty.However, Ling Zhong Kuan naturally did not feel this way. Cold sweat had already gathered on his forehead. He was in the middle stage of Element Gathering Tier, but the other was in the late stage of that Tier. This was an unbreachable gulf.But Ling Zhong Kuan definitely did not want be thrashed by Ling Han, this piece of trash; even more so since the latter was a member of the younger generation! Thus, he had to resist with all his might. Even if resistance was futile, he would flee if it came to the worst!\"Pang!\"He launched the Ling Clan's special skill, \"Three Flip Hands\", and advanced towards Liu Yu Tong.This was a martial skill from the medium level of Yellow Grade, and was also one of the three special skills belonging to the Ling Clan. With these three skills, Ling Clan became one of the two most powerful clans in Gray Cloud Town. The power of these skills was naturally fearsome.Unfortunately, his opponent happened to be Liu Yu Tong.\"Snapping of the Plum Hands!\" The icy beauty spat out lightly. Her small hands smoothly turned over, both as a clap and as a touch. Her movement was indescribably graceful, but its power was extremely fearsome. Her hands drew past, and Ling Zhong Kuan could only repeatedly retreat, his whole face turning red.Snapping of the Plum Hands, a martial skill from the high level of Yellow Grade!His cultivation was suppressed, his martial skills were suppressed\u2026 if there was any advantage that Ling Zhong Kuan could claim over his opponent, then that would be multiple years worth of battle experience he had. But, the problem was that Liu Yu Tong was a genius of Martial Dao. Although she did not have adequate experience, she had a shocking battle comprehension ability that could completely compensate for her inferior battle experience!How could Ling Zhong Kuan not lose?Through only fifty or sixty moves, Ling Zhong Kuan was completely restrained: his Dantian was restrained, his Origin Energy could not be circulated, and he was no stronger than a commoner.\"Grandfather!\"\"Father!\"Ling Mu Yun and the rest were all shouting. They wanted to rush forward but were too afraid of Liu Yu Tong's ability, and could only look at Ling Han with fury. They were completely devoid of any intention of self-reflecting, and only felt that it was all Ling Han's fault.If Ling Han had not appeared, then matters would have proceeded as they had planned.Ling Han looked at Liu Yu Tong, and said, \"If you make a slight change to your battle style, you will be even more powerful. For example, during your seventeenth move, you only had to further lower your right hand, and with your left hand clapping two inches further forward, you would have already restrained your opponent.Liu Yu Tong had not been convinced at first. She only thought that Ling Han had found some kind of ancient treasury, and had thus obtained high-level secret arts. Thus, he was able to use two verbal chants to allow the barrier she faced to loosen, and make her soon be able to break through.But now that she recalled the previous battle, the expression on her face changed slightly. Ling Han was right, if she had done as he just said, she would have been able to end this battle much sooner.She could not help feeling a little reverence towards Ling Han. His insight was too fearsome.Ling Han smiled internally. Who was he? Ten thousand years ago, he was considered a royal existence in the world of martial arts! Don't tell me that he would not be able to subdue a little girl? He walked towards Ling Zhong Kuan, and raised his right hand.\"Little beast, you dare!\" Ling Zhong Kuan glared. If he were to be thrashed by Ling Han, how would he face others in future?\"Pa!\"Ling Han's palm descended without any hesitation, giving Ling Zhong Kuan a heavy slap.\"Si!\"The other three members of the Ling Clan and the five maidservants simultaneously took in a breath of cold air. He actually did it\u2026! The grand Chief Butler of the Ling Clan was actually publicly slapped by a person everyone acknowledged as trash!\"Sss, no wonder this old dog has such thick skin, just hitting him hurts my hand,\" Ling Han said with bared teeth.This was natural. Body Refining Tier meant to use Origin Power to refine each part of the body and to allow every muscle to be filled with Origin Power. Every punch and kick would release a fearsome amount of power.Ling Zhong Kuan was already in the Element Gathering Tier, and has already completely passed through the Body Refining Tier. Thus, his face was naturally completely refined by Origin Power. Someone from the middle stage of Body Refining Tier may not even able to truly injure him, and only cause him a small pain. To cause him to bleed would require the use of weapons.However, now it was no longer the issue of being injured, but of humiliation!Slapped by a piece of trash who was also a younger relative at the second layer of Body Refining Tier... moreover, this was done in front of five maidservants. What kind of great humiliation was this? If this matter spread out, how would he be able to face others in future?Ling Zhong Kuan's eyes were about to spit fire. He shouted loudly, \"Little beast, this matter would not end like this! You will definitely regret this, definitely!\"\"Ai, you actually dare to threaten me in front of my follower, what stupidity!\" Ling Han sighed, and asked Liu Yu Tong, \"Someone is threatening your master, what do you say we should do?\"Liu Yu Tong's beautiful face twitched. She was the princess of the Liu Clan, how could she be able to get used to being someone's follower? However, she was still someone who kept her promises, so she immediately asked, \"Do you need me to kill him?\"Hearing these words, the two sons of Ling Zhong Kuan and Ling Mu Yun were shocked. Ling Zhong Kuan was their backbone, the tree that held up their sky! If Ling Zhong Kuan died, then they too would lose all the power they had in the Ling Clan.Ling Han shook his head with a smile. \"This old dog belongs to my father, so my father should be the one to get rid of him. But...\" he snapped off a table leg, and weighed it in his hand. \"He will not be punished with death, but he will not be able to escape another punishment!\"\"Peng!\" He raised the table leg and smacked it on Ling Zhong Kuan's face. After a heavy sound rang out, Ling Zhong Kuan opened his mouth and spat out a mouthful of blood and broken teeth.\"Old dog, my father is risking his life, yet you snatch away his hope. Don't you think you deserve some thrashing?You have your son and grandson, and my father doesn't?Yesterday, you counted on the fact that you were stronger than me, and cruelly beat me to the point of serious injury. Is this the kind of attitude an older relative should have? Since you are without shame, and don't want to act as an older relative, then why do I still have to bother thinking of your face and treat you as an elder?\"Ling Han thrashed him as he talked. A few hits afterwards, Ling Zhong Kuan's hair was already all over the place, his face covered with blood. He had already lost at least half the teeth in his mouth.However, although Ling Zhong Kuan looked pitiful, it did not matter how serious his external injury was, as he would be able to recover from it quickly thanks to the powerful life energy of a martial artist. It'd take an internal injury to actually endanger his life. Thus, Ling Han continued thrashing him cheerfully, completely unconcerned that he could actually beat the other to death.Ling Zhong Kuan no longer made any sound, but he swore in his heart that, in the future, when he had the ability to surpass Ling Dong Xing, he would definitely tear this pair of father and son into pieces.\"My hand's getting tired!\" Ling Han threw away the stick, and said, \"Yu Tong, accompany me on a trip.\"Yu, Yu Tong?Liu Yu Tong suddenly felt a shiver. This manner of address really gave her goosebumps! [1][1] ED/N: Just in case you feel confused by it: in China, one doesn't simply address a senior (or anyone of higher status, or someone of equal status you don't know well) using their first name. While there are ways to act even more chummy, this would be like a random peasant addressing Queen Elizabeth using just the name, \"Elizabeth\".Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Ling Mu Yun and others wanted to stop them but didn't dare to act. Even Ling Zhong Kuan was defeated\u2014who else in the Ling Clan had the power to resist?None... unless Ling Dong Xing returned, that is.However, even if Ling Dong Xing returned, which side would he be on? That was obvious.The five maidservants had extremely colorful expressions. They have watched such an interesting show that it'd be enough for them to brag about for three years.\"Where are we going?\" Liu Yu Tong asked Ling Han after leaving the Ling Clan Grounds.\"Heaven's Medicine Pavilion.\" Ling Han replied.Liu Yu Tong made an \"oh\". She thought that Ling Han would be prescribing her medicine. After all, she was a \"patient\".The two walked quickly, and after only ten minutes, they reached their destination.Heaven's Medicine Pavilion was a very powerful existence, and had a branch in every city in Rain Country. Whether there were any branches outside of Rain Country, Ling Han wasn't too sure due to his limited knowledge. Anyway, the variety of medicinal plants and pills in Heaven's Medicine Pavilion should be more than enough as they should have every kind available on market. If something couldn't be bought there, then it definitely could not be bought in other places as well.Ling Han entered the pavilion and approached a counter. Behind it sat a very beautiful young girl. Seeing Ling Han walk over, she immediately stood up with a smile, and said, \"Hello, my name is Xiao Tao. I'm honored to be of service.\"Her eyes focused on Liu Yu Tong for a moment. After all, this young girl was unusually beautiful; even she felt slightly captivated despite being female herself.Ling Han nodded, saying, \"I would like to buy Violet Lotus Grass, Blue Branch Fruit, Hundred Year Vermilion Bamboo, Red Leafed Potato, Rotted Leafed Dead Tree Roots.\"Xiao Tao's face went completely blank. She had been working here for over two years, and yet had never heard even the names of these five medicinal plants. She stared blankly for a moment before saying: \"Customers, I apologize, but I haven't even heard of these medicinal plants. Please wait for a moment, I will ask someone else on your behalf.\"\"All right,\" Ling Han nodded. These five medicinal plants were indeed quite uncommon, because aside from using them to concoct the Element Heart Recover Spirit Powder, they were very rarely used for other concoctions. And even though the Element Heart Recover Spirit Powder was not a high-grade concoction, it was a medicine he created personally during his previous life. Although he had taught the formula to a few people, it may not have been passed down through the generations.After a while, they saw Xiao Tao and a middle-aged man around thirty years of age walk towards them.\"Are you the one who's causing trouble?\" The middle-aged man looked at Ling Han, his face filled with disdain.Ling Han frowned. \"What do you mean, causing trouble?\"Bah, randomly naming some non-existent medicinal plants, isn't this purposely causing trouble?\" The middle-aged man harrumphed, his facial expression proclaiming silently: hah, I've seen through you.Ling Han asked, \"Why do you think that I just randomly named some non-existent medicinal plants?\"\"Aren't you asking nonsense? I'm a grand alchemist from the medium level of Yellow Grade. Even I have never heard of these medicinal plants, so aren't you just randomly naming them? Get out of here!\" The middle-aged man waved his hand as if he was shooing away flies.His name was Ma Da Jun, and he was indeed an alchemist at the medium level of Yellow Grade.There were other customers in the shop, and once they heard his words, they all let out an \"oh\" sound, their faces filled with respect.Alchemist was a very scarce and noble profession. There were four major grades in the profession - Heaven, Earth, Black, Yellow. Every grade was further divided into three minor levels - high, medium and low levels. However, even an alchemist from the medium level of the Yellow Grade was a welcomed and respected existence, someone all major powers would fight to have.It was like that also in Grey Cloud Town. There was only one alchemist of this rank, and he worked in Heaven's Medicine Pavilion. Usually, he didn't even need to concoct any medicinal pills; the purpose behind his presence was simply being an overseer.Thus, Ma Da Jun naturally had enough of a reason to be prideful.\"Even Alchemist Ma has said so, this brat must indeed have come to cause trouble.\"\"What a joke, he actually came to Heaven's Medicine Pavilion to misbehave. Where did this fool come from?\"Maybe he's come to please the audience?\"Everyone was on the side of Ma Da Jun. An alchemist was an extremely noble existence, and thus their partiality was hardly surprising.Ling Han was slightly irritated, and said, \"If you've never heard of them, that's because of your own lack of ability. How can you without any basis proclaim that others are just causing trouble? Go and ask for the most well-educated person in your shop, I shall speak to him.\"\"Who do you think you are to command me?\" Ma Da Jun similarly looked extremely unhappy. He had come out personally to expose him, so why was he still here, being a pest? Moreover, Ma Da Jun was the person in charge of this Heaven's Medicine Pavilion! Who else would be better educated than him here?Naturally, that was excluding Grandmaster Zhu. The other was just here on a holiday when he suddenly had a flash of inspiration, and so was just borrowing this Heaven's Medicine Pavilion's facilities to concoct pills.Seeing this, the corners of Liu Yu Tong's lips slightly lifted, and looked a little expectant.She would not act this time.Heaven's Medicine Pavilion was a colossal existence. Even the imperial family of Rain Country would have to treat them with respect! She was only a member of the younger generation of the Liu Clan, so she definitely could not accompany Ling Han to mess around in this place.Aren't you quite capable? Why are you being embarrassed now?Although she agreed to become Ling Han's follower, it was just temporary. Moreover, with her pride, that was something she was most unwilling to do\u2014at least at present. Thus, she really wanted to see Ling Han's embarrassed face.However cold a woman was, she would still want to retaliate when made unhappy.\"Get lost!\" Ma Da Jun brushed off his hands, looking impatient.\"You won't regret this?\" Ling Han slowly said.\"Haha, what can you do to me?\" Ma Da Jun felt unreasonably tickled. This young man actually dared to threaten him.The other people in the shop too looked as if they were watching a comedy. Was this young man a spoiled young master from some clan? However, even if he was the son of the clan head of either one of the two Great Clans, he would still not be qualified to stand against a medium level alchemist of the Yellow Grade.Ling Han only smiled, and turned towards Liu Yu Tong.A feeling of despise flashed through Liu Yu Tong's heart\u2014was he going to ask her to take action again? However, she only heard Ling Han say, \"Help me shout loudly 'You've put too much Copper Valley Sand!' Do it three times, the louder the better.\"What did that mean?Liu Yu Tong's beautiful eyes widened, but when she saw the confidence on Ling Han's face, her heart trembled and she couldn't help but do as he told her, \"You've put too much Copper Valley Sand! You've put too much Copper Valley Sand! You've put too much Copper Valley Sand!\"She was a person from the Element Gathering Tier, so her shout was like a lion's roar.\"You're both crazy, chase them out of here!\" Ma Da Jun furiously said to the two guards in the shop.\"Peng!\" A loud noise echoed out, as if something had exploded\u2014any alchemist would be able to tell that this noise was caused by an exploding furnace, something that every alchemist would experience.\"Tong, tong, tong, tong!\" A series of footsteps was heard from upstairs. Very quickly, a white-haired elder appeared at the top of the staircase, and shot right in front of Liu Yu Tong like an arrow, excitedly asking, \"How do you know that I've put in too much Copper Valley Sand?\"The elder's figure still had some traces of suffering from a furnace's explosion: his brow, beard and hair were all partially burned and half his face was blackened with ashes; his clothes were likewise in disarray, covered in singes. Being intently stared at by such an old man, the odd feeling within Liu Yu Tong's heart could be imagined.But what caused her greater surprise was the silver emblem hanging on one side of the elder's chest. That was the sign of an alchemist, and silver represented\u2026 Black Grade! One emblem represented low level.This elder was a low level alchemist of the Black Grade!Goodness, this kind of existence, even in the great clans of the imperial city, would be considered a revered guest. Even the Clan Head of her Liu Clan, faced with the other, would have to very politely address the other as \"Grandmaster\".But now, this \"Grandmaster\" was actually looking at her with a fawning gaze, his face filled with the desire to seek knowledge. How would Liu Yu Tong not feel odd?She couldn't help looking at Ling Han. How many other mysteries was this young man hiding?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was even more noble a status than a mayor of a city enjoyed. But someone like this, a Grandmaster, displayed such an expression just because of one word... how could they not be shocked?And the cause of everything was a young man.How was this possible!Many people were driven mad. This fact was something they couldn't accept, even if they shattered their heads!Ma Da Jun particularly looked quite aghast. This Grandmaster Zhu was an important personage in Heaven's Medicine Pavilion branch in Rain Country. He actually wasn't even able to see such a person normally. He had only heard of some of the other's affairs through rumors. [1]So how could he not be shocked, seeing this expression on the Grandmaster's face?Could it be that this brat was not here to cause trouble? Were the medicinal plants he named real?Ling Han sniffed a little, and said, \"Well, you're quite clever, making a few changes to the formula for the Wind and Fire Pill, using Purple Back Bear Pill, Thousand Shred Cane and Black Rock Powder to replace a few of the more valuable ingredients. In this manner, there would not be much difference in the medicinal effects, yet production cost could be greatly lowered.\"\"How did you know?\" Zhu He Xin suddenly turned around and looked at Ling Han in shock, asking in a rough voice. This was his secret! He had planned on publicizing it only after he had succeeded, so as to give a good shock to some of his old friends and rivals!Ling Han's smile widened, and he said, \"Naturally, I used my nose to sniff it out.\"Are you a monster? You found out just by using your nose? Pill formulae were an extremely valuable item, and no alchemist would easily reveal their formulae to others. To an alchemist, It was something as important as martial arts skills to a warrior!The problem was, even Zhu He Xin himself had not yet successfully completed his research on the improved medicinal pill formula, but Ling Han could analyze the formula just by using his nose! How could Zhu He Xin not be completely shocked by this?\"Your improved formula is feasible, but Copper Valley Sand is too strong, and the merging point is too high. So no matter how well ground it is, there will still be remnants within the completed pill, which will affect the quality of the pill. You can try using the teeth of Raging Flames Leopard as a replacement,\" Ling Han suggested. In his previous life, he had casually corrected a few people, and they later went on to become Grandmaster-level Alchemists.Zhu He Xin immediately started calculating in his heart, muttering, \"Raging Flames Leopard's elemental alignment is fire, which just happens to neutralize the Yin alignment of the Black Rock Powder, and when reaching a specific high temperature, will melt easily, so there won't be any remnants in the medical pill\u2026 wonderful, truly wonderful! Why didn't I think of that?\"The old man was dumbfounded. Looking at Ling Han with a fierce gaze, he immediately said: \"Young friend, please accompany me upstairs, and allow me to receive you,\" of course, the reception part was false. He wanted to sneakily hoax him into revealing a few more pill formulae.From what he's seen, Ling Han should be an heir to some influential family well-versed in alchemical arts.Ling Han smiled, but said, \"I can't!\"\"Why not?\" Zhu He Xin became frantic. This boy was very possibly a walking encyclopedia of pill formulae!\"Someone told me to get out,\" Ling Han said in a deliberate tone, glancing at Ma Da Jun.\"Putong!\" Ma Da Jun fell onto his knees. At this moment, he really wanted to cry but had no tears.How should he have known that Zhu He Xin would treat Ling Han this way? Had he known, he would have even respected Ling Han as an elder! Now what was he supposed to do? He couldn't stop the ugly expression on his face from showing.The other people in the shop were all watching and shaking their heads in their hearts. Had Ma Da Jun been slightly more polite in his speech and not so forceful in his attitude, he would still have a way out now.He had brought this onto himself!Zhu He Xin immediately turned his head, his wrinkled face showing a fearsome anger.How could he not be angered?As an alchemist, the one thing he sought in his entire life was to raise his own level in the arts of alchemy and obtain more pill formulae. Now, here was an obvious \"Encyclopedia of Pill Formulae\", and that guy actually asked him to get lost? Did he bore some hatred towards him?\"Fool!\" He shouted in anger, \"What's going on here? Explain to me!\"Ma Da Jun wanted to die; under the interrogation of Zhu He Xin, he did not dare not to answer, so he just recounted the incident that happened previously while stammering. Although he did not attempt to distort the facts, the insulting words he spoke to Ling Han were naturally not repeated. He wasn't that much of an idiot.\"What great authority you have!\" Zhu He Xin immediately gave him a hearty slap, causing Ma Da Jun to spin around on the spot three times before finally stopping, completely silly from the beating. \"You haven't heard of them so that means they don't exist? Should all the hundreds of thousands of medicinal plants you haven't heard of be removed from this world then? Let me tell you, these five medicinal plants indeed do exist!Violet Lotus Grass can be found in Eaglewood Valley, Blue Branch Fruit can be found in one of the valleys in Hundred Linked Mountains, Hundred Year Vermilion Bamboo grows in areas of extreme Yang, Red Leafed Potato is found underneath volcanic ash! Only Rotted Leafed Dried Tree Roots is rarer, it can only be found underneath the old roots of a tree that has rotted for more than one hundred years!\"\"I was wrong! I was wrong!\" Ma Da Jun kept apologizing in panic. What else was there to suspect if even Zhu He Xin himself had said so? He stretched out his hand and slapped himself, saying, \"I shouldn't have been conceited, I shouldn't have behaved like a snob!\"Zhu He Xin once again turned to Ling Han, and said, \"Young friend, many apologies, many apologies.\"He suddenly started, because he recalled that before he left his master, he had heard his master mention a particular formula. That was a medication used for healing injuries inflicted on the Spirit Base, and it required the five types of medicinal plants that Ling Han had wanted to buy.That time, his master had sighed with regret and said that although this formula did not require to be refined into the form of a medicinal pill, the effects were unexpectedly excellent. Unfortunately, possibly due to passage of time, only the names of some of the main ingredients were known, yet the actual method of creation was long lost.As such, it left a very strong impression on him, and now he had suddenly recalled everything.Could it be that Ling Han was buying these medicinal ingredients to concoct the Element Heart Recover Spirit Powder?The old man couldn't help the increasingly rapid beating of his heart. If he could get this formula and burn it as an offering to his late master, then his esteemed master would feel happy in the afterlife!\"Young friend, the medicinal ingredients you're buying, could it be that you want to concoct-\"\"Element Heart Recover Spirit Powder,\" Ling Han nodded, and truthfully said, \"My Spirit Base has been slightly injured.\"\"Pu!\"Ma Da Jun immediately puffed in shock. Damage to the Spirit Base was fatal to any martial artist; from what he knew, there was no way to completely recover from it! But Ling Han's words seemed to show that coming up with a remedy for it was a piece of cake for him!Liu Yu Tong's eyes brightened as well. She was Liu Clan's princess, and although she herself was not an alchemist, she knew that there were a lot of extremely valuable medicinal pills, like the Permanent Moon Pill, that could heal injuries to the Spirit Base.The problem was, the value of the Permanent Moon Pill was indescribably high. Even the Liu Clan would need to sacrifice colossal wealth to get merely one of them\u2026 and they might not be able to buy one even then!Ling Han, ah, Ling Han, how many secrets are you hiding?She was getting more and more curious about Ling Han. Now, even if Ling Han said that he didn't want her as a follower anymore, she reckoned her personal curiosity would make her stay.[1] ED/N: It's unclear whether the Yellow grade alchemist guy is surnamed Zhu or Ma. Sometimes raws say Zhu \u6731, sometimes they say Ma \u9a6c, and yet they clearly refer to the same person\u2026 Ma appears more often, especially in the previous chapter (fifty-fifty in this one) and was first, plus while this Zhu is different than the higher-ranked alchemist's surname, it has exactly the same pronunciation, including the tone, hence it is possible that author confused their surnames and even then made a typo or something.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In his last life, his position was at the absolute summit, but he was weak now, so he might as well befriend a couple more people and extend his social network.Meanwhile, for a small character like Ma Da Jun, a small punishment was enough. He would not lower himself to the same level as him.Zhu He Xin was delighted and hurriedly led Ling Han and Liu Yu Tong to an elegant study on the third floor.\"If I may ask, who is young friend's master?\" the old man asked.\"I have no master, I'm self-taught,\" Ling Han said. In his last life, he had visited many powerful authorities of alchemical arts and mastered everything. In the end, he formed his own faction, and became the greatest alchemist in history.Zhu He Xin naturally did not believe him. Ling Han was so young\u2014how was it possible for him to have such a deep knowledge of alchemy? However, he was very impressed with Ling Han, and had the intention to make him join Heaven's Medicine Pavilion. Thus, he asked him numerous questions to examine Ling Han's skill level.Ling Han calmly answered all his questions. He was a Grandmaster Alchemist; whether in the past or in the present, who could compare to him in the field of alchemy? As their conversation continued, the leading role gradually fell into his hands; he occasionally caused Zhu He Xin to rack his brains in ponder, and the old man's face became more and more respectful.There was no seniority in academics; whoever has the ability becomes the teacher.In the beginning, the old man kept addressing him \"young friend\", placing himself on a higher position, but very quickly, he changed his manner of address, and addressed Ling Han as \"fellow alchemist\". In the end, with his forehead beaded with cold sweat, he couldn't help standing up and respectfully standing at Ling Han's side to listen closely to his teachings, as if he was an apprentice. It was just like when he used to be taught by his esteemed master...In his heart, Ling Han had already reached a very high position. He even had a kind of feeling\u2014if only considering theory and insight, Ling Han had far surpassed his own master!\"Grandmaster, may I follow by your side, and continue to listen to your teachings?\" When Zhu He Xin said this, Liu Yu Tong was almost shocked to death. But after she carefully thought it over, it seemed to be the natural order of events.However, if this was known by the other Great Clans in the imperial city, she was afraid that everyone would die of envy!This was an actual Black Grade Alchemist! Although he was only a low level one, the title of Black Grade was more than enough, wasn't it?Liu Yu Tong was astonished, and her resistance to the idea of being Ling Han's follower decreased slightly\u2014even a grandmaster alchemist like Zhu He Xin was begging to follow Ling Han, so what did she have to complain about?Ling Han shook his head, and said, \"At this moment, I have no intention to take on any disciples.\" In truth, Zhu He Xin's talent in the field of alchemy, in his opinion, could only be considered ordinary. In the past, he had taken on three disciples, and all three of them were exceptionally talented.Zhu He Xin only felt that it was a pity, and furthermore fully realized that Ling Han refused because his natural talent in alchemy was ordinary, therefore he was not qualified to become his disciple. He too felt that this was natural. After all, Ling Han's knowledge and skill in the field of alchemy was at too high a level, one which he was only able to admire and look up to from afar. To become the other's disciple was indeed too much to hope for.Liu Yu Tong was dumbstruck that Ling Han had actually refused!He refused!This person was an actual low level Black Grade alchemist, and as long as Zhu He Xin agreed, even the imperial family of Rain Country would fall over themselves to meet him, and maybe would even gift him with a princess's hand in marriage. However, Ling Han had actually refused him without much consideration!This guy\u2026 was really incomprehensible.\"However, if you encounter any trouble with understanding something, you can still come to the Ling Clan to look for me whenever you like,\" Ling Han said.\"Many thanks, Grandmaster, many thanks, Grandmaster!\" Zhu He Xin repeatedly raised his clasped hands in Ling Han's direction, his face revealing the utter joy he was feeling.Liu Yu Tong felt speechless in her mind. If this scene was seen by others, they would definitely be so shocked that their eyeballs would fall out of their sockets! A person with the noble status of a Black Grade alchemist was actually performing the salutations of a disciple in front of Ling Han, feeling honored merely because of being able to visit him!\"En, then I'll take my leave,\" Ling Han said.\"Let me see you off, Grandmaster!\" Zhu He Xin quickly said.\"Oh, right. Yu Tong, did you bring any money with you? Help me pay for medicine in advance,\" Ling Han turned towards Liu Yu Tong and said.Liu Yu Tong, of course, now knew that this medication was intended for Ling Han himself and not for her illness, so she couldn't stop her lips from twitching, thinking that this guy really knew how to make the best use of everything. He had just taken her in as a follower and now he was aiming for her purse\u2026\"No need, no need!\" Zhu He Xin hurriedly waved his hands. The alchemical knowledge he heard from Ling Han today was invaluable; how could he bear to take Ling Han's payment for the medicinal ingredients? \"Great Master, please do allow me to express some of my gratitude by waving the payment.\"Ling Han pondered for a moment, then said, \"Then do as you like.\"Though he had only casually taught Zhu He Xin a bit, he was the actual Alchemy Emperor. This little bit of teaching would be enough for Zhu He Xin to benefit from for the rest of his life.Zhu He Xin immediately looked delighted. To be able to do something for Ling Han, even if it was only such a small favor, made him extremely elated. He even felt honored!\"Then I'll buy some Return Origin Pills,\" Ling Han said after thinking for a while.\"Return Origin Pill, this kind of cheap thing, how can I let Grandmaster buy it? Anyway, it's something I can casually create, so naturally, it'll be a gift to Grandmaster,\" Zhu He Xin quickly said.Liu Yu Tong was once again rendered speechless. Return Origin Pill could allow a martial artist to quickly recover his Origin Power. It was an indispensable support during combat, and it was not something simple that could be \"casually created\".Although Ling Han only required the lowest level Lower Grade Return Origin Pills, even one of them would be worth three silver coins at least.Zhu He Xin was very generous, immediately giving Ling Han one hundred Return Origin Pills. If it was not for the fact that Ling Han was still only in the Body Refining Tier and could only take low-level Return Origin Pills, he would definitely have presented him with high-level Return Origin Pills instead.Ling Han and Liu Yu Tong descended down the stairs and left, seen off by Zhu He Xin.\"Where are we going now?\" Liu Yu Tong could not help asking after the two had walked for awhile.Ling Han smiled slightly, and said, \"Naturally home, to wait for the medicine to be delivered.\" Without healing the Spirit Base first, he had no way to start cultivating.Liu Yu Tong curiously asked, \"You really know how to concoct pills?\"\"There should be no one on this world who knows that better than me,\" Ling Han bluntly said.\"You're bragging!\" Liu Yu Tong harrumphed. Although Ling Han had completely subdued Zhu He Xin, Zhu He Xin was only a Black Grade alchemist. There were still alchemists of Earth Grade and Heaven Grade above him!Ling Han did not argue with her. His status had long been engraved in history.\"Why didn't you agree to let Grandmaster Zhu follow by your side? He's not only an alchemist, but also a warrior of Gushing Spring Tier,\" Liu Yu Tong asked.Ling Han paused in his step, turned over to look at her, and continued walking forwards, saying: \"First, your Spirit Base is of Heaven Grade, and you've now reached the eighth level of Element Gathering Tier, so you're one step away from breaking through to Gushing Spring Tier. Second, I don't need anyone to concoct pills for me. Third, if I really need to have someone by my side, then a beautiful girl is far easier on the eyes than an old man.\"Liu Yu Tong could not help but be speechless. However, his words did cause her to be a little pleased deep within her heart.\"We'll go home first. I still have to teach you Three Yin Mysterious Arts,\" Ling Han said.Liu Yu Tong could not help feeling a bit excited and her steps quickened. The illness that caused her to fall asleep without reason has troubled her for far too many years.The two returned to the Ling Clan Residence. On the whole way, all servants they saw were wearing peculiar expressions. They had heard of what had happened that morning\u2014that the Chief Butler had actually been trashed by Young Master Trash. It wasn't too surprising for them to know about it, for this kind of news would naturally spread throughout the whole clan quite quickly.Ling Han pretended to see nothing and brought Liu Yu Tong to his room to start teaching her Three Yin Mysterious Arts.\"Aren't you afraid I'll go back on my word?\" Liu Yu Tong suddenly asked when Ling Han was about to recite the arts.\"Will you?\" Ling Han asked in return.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Get the cultivation technique through deception first, and then compensate Ling Han with some material objects\u2014is what she thought. Who asked Ling Han to ignore her noble status as the princess of a noble family and insist on having her as his follower?Yet now, she was hesitant. The reserved nature of a girl caused her to really want to leave Ling Han's side, but once she recalled the endless miracles Ling Han had displayed, she wanted to stay at his side, curious to see where his limits were.\"Maybe yes, maybe not. Who can say for sure?\" She gave him an ambiguous answer.Ling Han laughed heartily. If Liu Yu Tong had solemnly vowed to be steadfastly loyal to him, he would not have believed her. However, he was a grand warrior of the Heaven Tier and the Alchemy Emperor! How could he be unable to subdue this little slip of a girl?\"Take off your clothes,\" he casually said.Liu Yu Tong suddenly looked furious. Could Ling Han want to force her to sacrifice her body in exchange for teaching her the cultivation technique? Although she didn't want to die, and really did very much want her illness cured, if she had to use her body in exchange, then she would rather die!\"Don't misunderstand!\" Ling Han said with a smile, \"I only want to guide you in the circulation path of the Origin Power. This particular cultivation technique requires the Origin Power in your body to circulate through many odd paths and can't be explained simply through words. You should know yourself that the slightest difference leads to a huge loss, so if there is the tiniest discrepancy in the circulation of the cultivation technique... that's why we must make sure that there is no any discrepancy or error at all.\" [1]Liu Yu Tong paused. Ling Han's words were not false. There were uncountable veins and arteries within human body. If there was the tiniest bit of error in the circulation path of Origin Power, then the results would be vastly different.The problem was that she was an unmarried young lady; how could she take off all her clothes and allow a man's finger to roam over her whole body?She considered for a long while, then suggested a compromise\u2014she would keep her undergarments on, and Ling Han would use a chopstick instead of a finger in guiding the circulation of her Origin Power.\"Get out first!\" Liu Yu Tong said, pointing outside.\"Hey hey hey, this is my room!\" Ling Han laughed, but he still stood up and walked outside. He still had this little bit of gentlemanly character.He waited for a long while before he finally heard Liu Yu Tong say, \"You can come in now.\"Ling Han entered the room to see Liu Yu Tong seated on the bed, her beautiful figure concealed by a bedsheet, her beautiful hair falling over her shoulders like a waterfall. She was very enchanting.'She really is a captivating and extraordinarily beautiful girl,' Ling Han thought. Even considering the demanding eyesight he had in his last life, he couldn't help but admit that the charm of this icy beauty caused his heart to slightly stir.Snow-white teeth biting red lips, beautiful eyes roaming around\u2026 looking both resentful and pitiful, Liu Yu Tong slowly slipped out of the bedsheet, and her beautiful, jade-like figure appeared.There was only a tube top on her upper body, and her fair, smooth skin was like the highest grade of jade, exuding an entrancing luster. She wore underpants on her lower body, but she had torn the trouser legs from her upper thigh downwards, revealing two long, straight legs. They were neither too plump nor too thin, rather, they could be considered perfect, causing one's heartbeat to speed up. [2]Seeing Ling Han's roaming eyes, she couldn't help feeling embarrassed. Her beautiful, jade-like face blushed, adding on to her allure.Goodness, she was supposed to be an icy beauty, but now that she was blushing, she suddenly became a universal temptation, looking so enchanting that even Ling Han's Heaven Tier temperament from his last life was slightly disturbed, causing him to want to devour this captivating little demon.But he quickly came back to his senses and said, \"Sit in a cross-legged position, I'll be teaching you the first level of mental cultivation method from Three Yin Mysterious Arts.\"He recited it word by word. At first Liu Yu Tong couldn't enter into the right state of mind. After all, she was almost naked in the same room with a man, but her martial artist's heart very quickly defeated her embarrassment as she listened carefully to Ling Han's verbal chants, committing them to her memory.Ling Han spoke very quickly, but Liu Yu Tong showed shocking talent\u2014it was almost like whatever she heard, she would never forget. Ling Han only recited everything twice, and Liu Yu Tong already managed to remember almost a thousand words' worth of verbal chants.This was only the first step. The next step, and also the key factor, was the circulation path of the Origin Power.Ling Han, using a chopstick in place of his finger, lightly drew all over Liu Yu Tong's beautiful figure, guiding her in circulating her Origin Power.Once, twice... only three times were enough for Liu Yu Tong to already circulate her Origin Power according to the new cultivation technique. She truly deserved the title genius!Ling Han hurriedly departed from the room. This little demon was really too enchanting. He seemed to have overestimated his own willpower. If things continued in the same way, he very possibly would end up taking advantage of and pushing down this entrancing beauty.Since Liu Yu Tong had already started cultivation, she would definitely not regain consciousness in the short term. Thus Ling Han decided to just sit outside and similarly begin cultivating.However, he was not cultivating Five Elements Heaven Grade skill. Instead, he began cultivating Indestructible Heaven Scroll.Because his Spirit Base was not healed yet, he did not dare to take any risks. If his Spirit Base was injured further, then it would not be healed even by Element Heart Recover Spirit Powder.The circulation of Indestructible Heaven Scroll was like a bottomless pit, very quickly expending the little Origin Power he had within his body to refine his muscles, veins and bones and make them stronger.If it was cultivated to the limit, then the body would neither deteriorate nor age. Even if a meteor crashed into him, the meteor would shatter while he would be completely unharmed.Of course, he was much too far from reaching that state.After merely five minutes, the Origin Power stored within his body was completely exhausted, so he swallowed a Return Origin Pill to quickly recover the Origin Power within his body and then continue cultivation.Each medicine has poisonous properties. In the beginning, the Return Origin Pill could exhibit the best effects, but as the amount he took increased, the immunity of his body to the pill's effects also largely increased, causing the pill's effects to worsen until, finally, he could only recover less than one tenth of his Origin Power after taking a pill.Ling Han stopped. The day had ended; to continue cultivation would be of no effect.However, his improvement was very obvious.His muscles, veins and bones have all become slightly stronger. According to his estimate, this kind of strength would compare to the third level of Body Refining Tier.No wonder it was called Heaven Scroll! It was awesome!In his last life, Ling Han had also cultivated a few recovery type skills, like Golden Body Secrets and Boulder Technique, which allowed the body to become stronger. However, their effects could not compare to Indestructible Heaven Scroll's effectiveness. The difference between them was like that between heaven and earth.That was normal. If Indestructible Heaven Scroll was not that good, how could it be possible that a warrior of the Heaven Tier would need to spend over ten thousand years to comprehend it? Not to mention, even then it was only the first layer he comprehended!'However, cultivating this Indestructible Heaven Scroll really expends a lot of Origin Power, and would still need a large amount of valuable medicines to support refining the body! This would definitely delay my cultivation! However, this Indestructible Heaven Scroll has too great a power; the delay would be worth it. My Spirit Base is Immortal Grade, anyway.I shouldn't think about the highest tier of neither deteriorating nor aging body yet. The first level of Indestructible Heaven Scroll is also further divided into four tiers, which are respectively the Dead Tree Tier, the Rock Cliff Tier, the Iron Sheet Tier and the Diamond Tier.Once I reach the Dead Tree Tier, my body would be like a dead tree. Attacks on me would be as if hurting a dead tree without damaging its life. I can even have my body be like a dead tree, without any life signs. No one would be able to tell that I would still be alive. Once I reach the Diamond Tier, then no matter how heavy the injury, it could be recovered in an instant; even a torn off limb would be able to recover. It's practically a godly skill!'\"En?\"Ling Han turned around and looked at the door to the inner chamber. The curtain moved, and a goddess-like figure walked out, her lightly blushing face incomparably graceful, beautiful and entrancing.\"You've completed cultivating the first level of Three Yin Mysterious Arts?\" Ling Han said with a little surprise.\"En!\" Liu Yu Tong nodded, slightly afraid to meet Ling Han's eyes. An odd feeling was stirring to life within her heart, one that she had never felt before.'This girl really is a genius!' Ling Han thought in his heart.[1] ED/N: \u5dee\u4e4b\u6beb\u5398\u5931\u4e4b\u5343\u91cc, meaning \"the slightest difference leads to a huge loss\" is an idiom equivalent to the English \"a miss is as good as a mile\".[2] ED/N: Here, those interested in some, cough, research can copy-paste the following word in google images: \u62b9\u80f8.

The ninth layer would be the Heaven Tier, which was the highest tier that Ling Han had reached in his previous life.Out of the many cultivation techniques circulated all over the world, none have broken through to the tenth tier, which was the Shattering Void Tier. That was why Ling Han travelled all over the world to visit all kinds of ancient historical sites.The first layer of the cultivation technique known as Three Yin Mysterious Arts corresponded to the Body Refining Tier, a stage Liu Yu Tong had long passed through. It was naturally easy for her to cultivate it again. It was just like a high school student doing the homework of a junior high student.But the problem was, she had actually completed cultivation of the first layer within such a short time! Wasn't her talent way too strong?But thinking once more, Liu Yu Tong had the Three Yin Vanishing Veins, and Three Yin Mysterious Arts was originally formulated for someone who possessed such veins, so her impressive cultivation speed was something normal.Ling Han nodded, saying, \"Then I'll continue to teach you the second layer. As long as you are able to cultivate the majority of the third layer, you will have completely suppressed the Three Yin Vanishing Veins, and will no longer be affected by them.The third layer\u2014in other words, she would reach strength equal to the Gushing Spring Tier.However, Liu Yu Tong was already at the eighth layer of Element Gathering Tier. Moreover, she could already sense the juncture to break through to the ninth layer, so she was only one step away from breaking through to the Gushing Spring Tier.Liu Yu Tong couldn't stop the blush on her beautiful face from increasing even more. To begin teaching her the second layer now, wouldn't that mean that she would have to take off her clothes again?\"Don't let your imagination run wild!\" Ling Han said in reprimand.Liu Yu Tong could not help fiercely glaring at him. Her imagination was not running wild; rather, she was afraid that Ling Han's imagination was running wild instead!The two once again returned to the inner chamber and, just like the previous time, Liu Yu Tong removed her robe, allowing her alluring, beautiful figure to appear practically naked in front of Ling Han. As the saying went, the first time is awkward, the second is easy; although she was still very embarrassed, it was much better than the first time.When Ling Han taught her the second layer, it was almost night. So, he had servants deliver two servings of dinner, of which he himself ate a large portion, leaving a smaller one for Liu Yu Tong.Women, you see, have small appetites, so a small portion was enough.After about three hours had passed, Liu Yu Tong once again exited and said in extreme surprise, \"My cultivation speed now is actually ten times faster than it used to be!\" This meant that once she broke through to the ninth layer of Element Gathering Tier, she'd need less than two months to be able to reach the top before tackling the Gushing Spring Tier.Too fast!Ling Han could not help smiling, and said, \"Three Yin Mysterious Arts is a Heaven Grade cultivation technique.\"Heaven Grade cultivation technique!Liu Yu Tong almost fainted. What did Heaven Grade cultivation technique mean?Let's just put it this way: the reason why the Liu Clan had become one of the Eight Great Clans in the Imperial City was because they had a scroll named <<Red Cloud Secrets>>, which was a Black Grade medium level cultivation technique. At the same time, the Imperial Qi Clan was able to secure its position as the Lord of the Land because they had a scroll named <<Seven Massacre Skills>>, which was a Black Grade high level cultivation technique!In other words, a Black Grade high level cultivation technique would allow the creation of an empire, and a Black Grade medium level cultivation technique would allow a power to become one of the great clans of Rain Country and thrive for a thousand years!Now then, what significance did a Heaven Grade cultivation technique have?It was indescribably valuable!If Ling Han had said from the start that he would teach her a Heaven Grade cultivation technique, she would definitely have treated him as if he was crazy. You couldn't blame her\u2014after all, if a puny, little clan from Gray Cloud Town could have a Heaven Grade cultivation technique, then wouldn't this world be completely messed up?But now, she couldn't not believe him, for she had personally experienced it.\"This is an actual Heaven Grade cultivation technique, and you're just going to teach it to me like this?\" Her heart trembled\u2014there was an unexplainable throbbing within her heart.Ling Han smiled. This Three Yin Mysterious Arts indeed was a Heaven Grade cultivation technique, but could only be cultivated by the possessor of the Three Yin Vanishing Veins. It was useless in anyone else's hands, so of course he did not fear that Liu Yu Tong would divulge it.Moreover, he had obtained Indestructible Heaven Scroll, a truly supreme godly cultivation technique! Just comprehending its first layer required ten thousand years! Compared with this, no matter what kind of Heaven Grade cultivation technique it was... bah! It was completely worthless!Naturally he would not tell her that. Instead, he said, \"You are my follower, I'm never a miser to my own people!\"This was not a lie\u2014he had always swept any mess made by those close to him under the rug, and was very generous towards his own people.Liu Yu Tong could not stop an expression of embarrassment from appearing on her beautiful face. According to her understanding, the words \"own people\" had a completely different meaning. After a while, she finally said, \"Don't worry, without your permission, I will not teach this cultivation technique to anyone else.\" [1]\"Whatever,\" Ling Han said. There would only be one possessor of the Three Yin Vanishing Veins every few thousand years anyway, so even if she taught it to someone else, it would be lost through the long passage of time\u2014to anyone else, this was a cultivation technique that couldn't even compare to Yellow Grade low level cultivation technique since no one else could cultivate in it. Who would actually want to preserve it for thousands of years?Liu Yu Tong could not help feeling a little disappointed. Previously her heart was trembling in excitement, and if Ling Han had just used a few sweet words to pamper her a bit, her good feelings towards Ling Han would definitely increase; however, Ling Han simply did not bear such thoughts, and so he missed an excellent opportunity.She walked towards the table, and began to eat. While slowly eating, she said, \"From tomorrow onwards, I will have to enter seclusion to tackle the ninth layer of Element Gathering Tier, so I won't be able to follow you around in this period.\"\"Ha ha, don't worry, don't worry! I have no plans to go anywhere these two days, I will simply wait for Zhu He Xin to deliver the medicinal ingredients. I plan to heal my Spirit Base first before doing anything else,\" Ling Han said. He treasured this second life very much. Now that his Spirit Base was injured, he definitely did not want to take unnecessary risks and ruin his own foundation in martial arts.Liu Yu Tong did not waste time. Once she finished eating, she entered seclusion to break through to the ninth layer of Element Gathering Tier. Ling Han could only yield the inner chamber to her and move his bed to the outer chamber.Ling Zhong Kuan and his group felt immeasurable hatred towards Ling Han, but thanks to Liu Yu Tong's presence, they absolutely did not dare have any crazy ideas. Ling Han seldom came out, and only waited quietly for Zhu He Xin to deliver the medicine and for Liu Yu Tong to come out of seclusion, thus making it even more difficult for them to act.As expected, Zhu He Xin did not go back on his word and, on the fourth day, personally came to deliver the medicinal ingredients requested by Ling Han. Naturally, the old man also took the chance to consult with Ling Han. In truth, he had wanted to come over these few days, but in his eyes, Ling Han was at the level of a supreme grandmaster, so he didn't dare to come and disturb him for no reason.However, Ling Han did not have much patience today and very quickly saw Zhu He Xin off. He wanted to immediately start concocting, heal his Spirit Base and once again return to the path of cultivation.To Ling Han, concocting medicine was naturally a piece of cake. After only three minutes, he had finished concocting the Element Heart Recover Spirit Powder\u2014he did not stay idle these three days; aside from cultivating Indestructible Heaven Scroll, he naturally had completed the preparatory work.\"Concoctions are really too bitter, ai!\" Ling Han sighed as he swallowed the Element Heart Recover Spirit Powder completely.Not long after, a heat-like energy attacked his body, and he suddenly had the feeling that there was some sort of fire burning within his body. Upon examining his Dantian, he saw that the damaged Spirit Base was currently slowly recovering, and would be fully recovered within no more than half a day.Within this time period, he could not do anything else, so he simply waited patiently.To someone who had been in 'slumber\" for ten thousand years, half a day's wait naturally meant little.Slowly, within Ling Han's Dantian, the Five Elements Mix Chaos Lotus completely bloomed, very natural and beautiful, too wonderful for words.[1] ED/N: Not 100% sure about that, but I think that this expression has two meanings: one that he meant his subordinates, and another that he meant his women. At the very least I encountered this expression in the exactly same context in several other novels.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 11": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Alchemy Emperor of the Divine DaoCH 11Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHe could finally start cultivating!Ling Han had been waiting for it for three long days. Add to that the long wait he had experienced for the past ten thousand years, and it was no wonder that he would immediately sit in a cross-legged position to cultivate now that he realized he could finally start cultivating.However, just as he was about to circulate Five Elements Heaven Grade Skill, he paused for a while, stood up and opened the door to his room, entering the courtyard outside.Liu Yu Tong was still in seclusion to break through to the ninth layer of Element Gathering Tier inside the inner chamber. If he started cultivating too close to her, he would disturb the spiritual environment within this small area and affect her cultivation.See? What a considerate master he was!Ling Han sat cross-legged in the courtyard. This courtyard belonged to his father, Ling Dong Xing. As the Clan Head of the Ling Clan, the courtyard was naturally very big, but Ling Han had long since dismissed the servants, and would only allow someone to deliver the three meals of the day here.Come, come, let me see the greatness of an Immortal Grade Spirit Base!With a mental command from Ling Han, his Spirit Base immediately bloomed like a flower. A lotus of the Dao, the five elements in balance... this was the most perfect form of a Spirit Base!\"Weng!\" The spiritual Qi immediately rushed over from all directions, rich beyond compare.The Five Elements of the world\u2014Gold, Wood, Water, Fire and Earth\u2014and thus five different types of Spiritual Qi rushed frantically into his body, the latter like a thirsty horse drinking from a spring.Ordinarily, a person had no way to absorb more than one type of Spiritual Qi because it was impossible to simultaneously refine more than one type of it. That's why cultivators usually focused only on one in their cultivation.For example, someone could have a Spirit Base with a dual alignment of fire and earth, the fire Spirit Base being slightly stronger. It meant that the absorption rate of fire type Spiritual Qi would be higher, so he would only need to focus on refining fire type Spiritual Qi, and would not be able to obtain both it and earth type Spiritual Qi.However, the wonderful characteristic of the Five Elements Mix Chaos Lotus was that it could take advantage of the mutual reinforcement and restraint of the Five Elements, and make the five different types of Spiritual Qi create a perfect balance. [1]However, absorbing Spiritual Qi was one matter, refining it was another. Only Five Elements Heaven Grade Skill could achieve both.This cultivation technique was not something just anyone could control. It required high-level multitasking and did not allow any errors or mistakes; otherwise, the Origin Power could enter the wrong pathways. A light consequence of this would be spitting out some fresh blood; the most serious consequence would be instant death.Immortal Grade Spirit Base, Heaven Grade Skill, an extremely strong control... only with these three factors combined would one possessing the Five Elements Mix Chaos Lotus Spirit Base be able to cultivate Five Elements Heaven Grade Skill. Being able to satisfy such high requirements\u2026 Ling Han's cultivation speed could be imagined.Endless Spiritual Qi rushed inwards and Ling Han's body continuously generated Origin Power, refining his blood, flesh, veins and bones.A martial artist of the Body Refining Tier had not yet opened up his Dantian, and so could only store his Origin Power within his blood, flesh, veins and bones. Only once he stepped into the Element Gathering Tier could he open up his Dantian and form a small world within his body to accommodate his Origin Power there.In his previous life, he was a strong warrior of the Heaven Tier, so naturally he would not make any wrong turns on the path of cultivation. As he now possessed the greatest Spirit Base in the world and cultivated the best first-rate technique in existence, the speed of his progress was naturally as if he had grown wings and taken flight.The middle period of the second layer of Body Refining Tier... late period... peak... with only a slight tremble of his body, the hurdle for the third layer of Body Refining Tier was immediately overcome.So fast!Ling Han nodded secretly. In his last life, he had a High Level Heaven Grade Spirit Base, but he had still spent twelve days to get from the second layer of Body Refining Tier to the third layer of Body Refining Tier\u2014however, it was not because a High Level Heaven Grade Spirit Base was really poor in comparison to an Immortal Grade Spirit Base, but rather because Ling Han had been cultivating a High Level Yellow Grade cultivation technique at that time.The present him was as if standing on the shoulder of a giant\u2014there was no way that his last life could compare to the starting point he was at now.He had no intention of stopping there. He intently and continuously refined the Spiritual Qi from the environment, turning it into his own body's Origin Power.The early period of the third layer of Body Refining Tier... middle period... late period... peak... within only a few hours' time, he had reached the limit of the third layer and thus of the early stage of the Body Refining Tier.However, after spending such a long time cultivating, his mental energy was largely depleted. The requirements for controlling Five Elements Heaven Grade Skill were quite high after all.If he continued cultivating, he could mis-refine his Origin Power at any moment, bringing only harm and no benefit.Still, he had already reached this level, so no matter what, he wanted to break through to the fourth layer of Body Refining Tier today!The third layer was still the early stage of Body Refining Tier, while the fourth layer was the middle stage; this was a large leap and not just a simple breakthrough from one layer to another.For an ordinary person to think of breaking through twice in a short period of time, that was without doubt a complete fantasy. No matter what, to break through would require at least two or three days of accumulating Origin Power. However, Ling Han was a warrior of the Heaven Tier in his last life, so to him, there were no bottlenecks before Heaven Tier.\"Break through!\" He snorted lightly, and there was a subtle change within his body; with a slight tremble of his body, he had once again broken through.'Fourth layer of Body Refining Tier, now this can finally be shown to others,' he showed a slight smile. Although this layer of cultivation could not be considered really high amongst those of the same age, to consecutively break through two minor layers within a single night was still something that gave him great satisfaction.Moreover, the cultivation technique he was using was a Heaven Grade Skill; his Origin Power was incomparably pure, its quality far higher than that of any other person's. The power of the fourth layer of Body Refining Tier he wielded was enough to compare with the power of someone from the peak period fifth layer of Body Refining Tier, or even the sixth layer!'Sleep!' He got onto the bed. Due to the large expense of his mental energy, he very quickly fell asleep. However, it was a light sleep as his consciousness was still seventy percent alert, so that he could immediately awaken at the smallest disturbance.The night passed quickly, and he was shaken awake by a great fluctuation of Origin Power.He immediately sat upright, revealing a very alert expression, but then immediately realized that it was not an enemy attack, but rather Liu Yu Tong who had broken through!To break through to the ninth layer of Element Gathering Tier from the eighth layer of Element Gathering Tier in three days, her talent was really quite good. For every tier, the further one got, the harder it was to break through; it was as if one was rowing a boat against the tide.With a soft sound, the hanging curtain of the doorway opened, and he could see Liu Yu Tong walk out, a strong energy fluctuation present around her body. She had just broken through, and was still unable to control the energy swelling around her body properly.\"I broke through!\" She said to Ling Han, and there was delight and pride on her beautiful face.Three days to completely breach the gap between two layers, moreover the most difficult one between eighth and ninth layer, this was indeed something to take pride in.She looked towards Ling Han, hoping to hear a compliment from the other's mouth.However, her joy and pride very quickly completely vanished. The expression on her face was as if she had just seen a ghost; pointing towards Ling Han, she said, \"You, you, you... you, you're already in the fourth layer of Body Refining Tier!\"She remembered very clearly that, before her seclusion, Ling Han was only at the second layer of Body Refining Tier; moreover, Zhu He Xin's medicine had only been delivered yesterday morning! Carefully calculating, from the moment his Spirit Base recovered to the moment he broke through to the fourth layer of Body Refining Tier, Ling Han had only spent one day and one night!One day and one night to break through two minor layers, under comparison, what would her spending three days just to break through one layer count as?Everyone said that the young master of the Ling Clan was a standard piece of trash, but if someone with this kind of progress rate was still considered a piece of trash\u2026 then what would she count as? A piece of trash amongst all other trash?\"You, you, you're now in the fourth layer of Body Refining Tier!\" Even her voice had a slight tremble in it....If someone had told her a day ago that she would be shocked because of someone breaking through to fourth layer of Body Refining Tier, she would have replied with nothing but a snort of contempt. However, if they added that that someone spent one day to break through from the second layer of Body Refining Tier to the fourth layer of Body Refining Tier, she would definitely find that the biggest joke in the world.She had once thought that there would be no more miracles from Ling Han, yet she never imagined that she would once again experience such an earth-shattering shock.Ling Han nodded, and with a calm tone, he said, \"That's right, what of it?\"'How can you dismiss it so lightly?' Liu Yu Tong immediately felt as if she was about to go mad.[1] ED/N: The idea about five elements in Chinese philosophy is that each element supports one but also restrains another. So, for example, Wood amplifies (supports) Fire, but Fire is being restrained by Water.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 12": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Alchemy Emperor of the Divine DaoCH 12Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"Peng, peng, peng, peng!\" It was at that very moment that an urgent knocking was heard from the door.Ling Han walked over and opened the door only to see a boy servant. He had already commanded that, if there was no urgent business, he was not to be disturbed; thus, he asked, \"What happened?\"\"The Clan Head has returned!\" The boy servant hurriedly said.Excitement instantly rose within Ling Han's body, pressing him to meet with that man; this was an instinctive reaction of the body.\"Father\u2026\" he murmured. He had inherited this body, and had also inherited the blood and responsibility that belonged to this body.He turned and smiled at Liu Yu Tong, saying, \"Yu Tong, come with me to meet my father.\"A red blush immediately flew upon Liu Yu Tong's beautiful face. She felt as if she was a daughter-in-law going to meet with her parents-in-law. 'Pei!' She hurriedly spat in her heart a few times\u2014why would she have this kind of feeling? There was nothing going on between herself and this guy!\"Where is Father?\" Ling Han asked the boy servant.\"In the Main Hall.\"Ling Han headed towards the Main Hall, and the pace of his steps increased from walking to running; there was a powerful longing in his heart. The moment he barged into the living hall, he saw a man of about forty years old, standing there proudly. He had a tall, broad figure, a handsome face, and exuded a powerful aura.At that moment, Ling Han could not longer differentiate whether it was the instinctive reaction of the body, or the fact that he was an orphan in his last life and so thirsted for familial love. His eyes could not help growing wet, and the blood relation running through his veins caused him to easily call out, \"Father!\"\"Han'er!\" Ling Dong Xing laughed heartily and quickly walked over to embrace Ling Han. However, he immediately put on a shocked expression and said, \"Why are you still in the clan residence, aren't you supposed to have gone to Hu Yang Academy?\"This was fatherly love, this was fatherly love!Ling Han greedily enjoyed the embrace of his father. Although in his last life, someone with Ling Dong Xing's cultivation level was not even qualified to enter his eyes, now he was shaken to the point that his eyes were brimming with tears. He had finally cast aside the identity of his last life to enjoy his new life.He was no longer a loner without any family. He had a father, a good father who would risk his own life for him!He rubbed at the corners of his eyes, shook his head and said, \"I don't want to go to Hu Yang Academy.\"\"Why?\" Ling Dong Xing asked. He knew that the quality of his only son's Spirit Base was too poor. Even though he had expended various efforts, his cultivation still did not make any progress; this was something that could not be helped. And he too had worked very hard to send Ling Han to Hu Yang Academy, which was to make use of the various immeasurable resources on hand at Hu Yang Academy to forcibly raise Ling Han's cultivation level to Element Gathering Tier. Only with that could he die without regrets.But Ling Han actually said he did not want to go to Hu Yang Academy! This caused his anger to rise\u2014there was no helping being born with poor talent, but if there was not even a tiny bit of desire to improve oneself, then there really was no cure!Ling Han naturally couldn't say that he had been a warrior of the Heaven Tier in his last life and there were countless high-level cultivation techniques and martial skills stored within his head, or that he had obtained the Indestructible Heaven Scroll that required him to spend ten thousand years just to comprehend the first layer. Even if he went to Hu Yang Academy, what was he supposed to learn?If he had really said so, Ling Dong Xing might think that he had been possessed.\"Yu Tong, come, come, come, come, this is my father,\" he said as he glanced at Liu Yu Tong, hurriedly beckoning her to come over with a wave of his hands, changing the subject. [1]\"Yu Tong hereby greets Ling Clan's Clan Head!\" Liu Yu Tong performed the greeting etiquette of a junior.Ling Dong Xing was startled; he did not know who Liu Yu Tong was, yet he could tell that she was a martial artist of the Element Gathering Tier just like him, and that her cultivation didn't differ much from his own\u2014both of them were at the ninth layer of Element Gathering Tier.Most martial artists would be able to tell the cultivation level of those weaker than themselves. Ling Han was an exception\u2014after all, he had brought along the amazing knowledge of a warrior of the Heaven Tier from his past life.With this being the case, she could completely stand at the same level as he, and there was no need for her to perform the greeting of a junior.Wait\u2026 could it be!He suddenly looked both joyful and surprised\u2014could it be because of Ling Han? This young girl liked his son? With this thought, he could not restrain his delight; this girl seemed to be only about seventeen or eighteen years old, yet shockingly, she was already at the ninth layer of Element Gathering Tier! Her talent definitely had to be extremely high!With such an excellent companion, so what if Ling Han's own cultivation level was poorer?No wonder this brat didn't want to go to Hu Yang Academy, it must be that he did not want to be separated from her. Hei hei, this brat was actually an affectionate character.\"You little brat!\" Ling Dong Xing first glared at Ling Han, then said to Liu Yu Tong, \"Miss, where are you from?\"\"The Liu Clan of the Imperial City,\" Liu Yu Tong replied.Ling Dong Xing was shocked. The Liu Clan of the Imperial City? Although there were many in the world with the surname Liu, there was only one Liu Clan in the Imperial City\u2014one of the Eight Great Clans, with power which was only below that of the Imperial Family in the whole of Rain Country.Such a great background?\"Wait, you should be the one sent from Hu Yang Academy to fetch Han'er to the academy, right?\" He suddenly saw a flash of light. Otherwise, how could it be possible someone of the Liu Clan from the Imperial City would appear here.\"Yes, Ling Clan Head,\" Liu Yu Tong said softly.Ling Dong Xing could not help looking over at Ling Han, and in his heart thought that although his son was not capable and without talent in martial arts, his ability to pick up girls really took one's breath away. The other was here only to fetch him, so how did he manage to capture the other's heart? Moreover, he only needed several days!Ling Han had inherited the graceful, charming demeanor of his younger days\u2026 yes, it had to be it...But since Liu Yu Tong was someone from Hu Yang Academy, why wouldn't Ling Han follow her then? The two of them would both be at the Yang Academy, so there wouldn't be any worry about being in two separate places.\"Father, I would like to be by your side for a while longer. I can go to the Academy anytime later anyway,\" Ling Han said. He did not want to scare his father, and thus planned to proceed slowly, and let Ling Dong Xing accept the change in him bit by bit.Ling Dong Xing gave a hearty laugh, and said, \"Good, good, good!\" After all, the one who would be fetching him was still here, so Ling Han could go to Hu Yang Academy at any time he wanted.He patted Ling Han's shoulder and was just about to say something more on the topic, but made a shocked expression as he noticed, \"Han'er, you've broken through!\"'Finally there is someone to share the shock I have experienced,' Liu Yu Tong thought.\"En, I broke through,\" Ling Han nodded.\"I have only departed for ten days, and you did not just break through... you actually broke through two layers!\" Ling Dong Xing's surprise did not decrease any bit, this kind of progression rate was completely inconceivable!If Ling Han had only broken through one layer, then it could be explained that Ling Han had been well-prepared, and had been at the same layer for too long a period of time and thus induced a one-time explosion using the accumulated Origin Power. But, two whole layers\u2026 this would practically shock others to death!Was his son really a piece of trash? If this was still considered a piece of trash, then was there still any genius in this world?Seeing the twitching corners of Ling Dong Xing's mouth, Liu Yu Tong instantly felt comforted in her heart. She didn't want to be the only one to always suffer this kind of great shock.\"En, it's acceptable,\" Ling Han nodded.Ling Dong Xing and Liu Yu Tong both rolled their eyes. Only \"acceptable\"? However, Ling Dong Xing instantly laughed heartily, saying, \"Hahaha, let's see who would dare to say my son is a piece of trash in the future!\"Which father would not want his son to be successful in life? So far, Ling Han could only be a piece of trash due to the limitations of his Spirit Base, yet now Ling Dong Xing felt as if he had seen a spark of hope.\"Father, I obtained a fateful encounter,\" Ling Han said.Ling Dong Xing nodded. If there had been no fateful encounter, how would Ling Han be able to make such quick progress? However, this fateful encounter was indeed extraordinarily large![1] ED/N: The Chinese have a tendency to repeat the same word for emphasis or in emotion several times. The one most common in novels is when some guy is angry so he says \"good!\" thrice (with the meaning being sth along the lines of, \"good job pissing me off\"). There are probably some rules regarding what kind of words can be repeated (one of such rules is probably that only short 1-character words can be repeated like that) but I'm not Chinese so I don't know about it too well.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I will only make you proud of me!\" Ling Han said.\"Good! Good! Good! You truly are my, Ling Dong Xing's, son!\" Ling Dong Xing too was excited to the point of shedding tears; although he did not know what kind of fateful encounter Ling Han had obtained, the present him could only feel joyful, excited and delighted! He wanted nothing more than to announce to the whole world that his son, Ling Dong Xing's son, was not a piece of trash!Liu Yu Tong looked at this scene and, for some reason, the corners of her eyes felt slightly wet.\"Father, I would like to discuss something with you!\" Ling Han pulled Ling Dong Xing to a corner of their courtyard, and let Liu Yu Tong go to rest first. There were some words that could only be said to his father and, after all, Liu Yu Tong had not yet obtained his true approval and trust.\"What kind of matter is it for you to be so mysterious about it?\" Ling Dong Xing asked with a smile and a bit of curiosity. He was curious what the words that could not even be heard by Liu Yu Tong could be\u2014he naturally thought that Ling Han and Liu Yu Tong were already a couple.Ling Han said, \"Father, let me look at your Spirit Base.\"One could actually view the Spirit Base using a special means, but for those in the Element Gathering Tier, they could directly project an image of their Spirit Base without having to resort to any supporting method.Ling Dong Xing could not help frowning, before saying, \"Why?\"\"I would like to find a cultivation technique that best suits you, taking into consideration your Spirit Base,\" Ling Han said.Ling Dong Xing could not help being secretly speechless, how many cultivation techniques had this son of his gotten his hands on to actually be able to choose a cultivation technique best suited to the individual according to their type of Spirit Base? If he had not just witnessed Ling Han's miracle, he would not believe his words one bit.He shook his head, yet did not say a single word.\"Father?\" When Ling Han looked at Ling Dong Xing, he realized there seemed to be some kind of hidden story.Ling Dong Xing exhaled a sigh and said, \"No matter what the cultivation technique is, it's useless. My Spirit Base is already destroyed.\"\"What!\" Ling Han called softly, but very soon, an enraged expression slipped onto his face, \"Who did it?\"Ling Dong Xing was a warrior of the Element Gathering Tier, so there was no way that his Spirit Base had been disabled from the start. Thus, the logical conclusion was that it had been crippled by someone else.Ling Han was someone who would cover the shortcomings of his own people, moreover this was his own father, so naturally he would be seething in anger.\"This matter\u2026. is related to your mother,\" Ling Dong Xing sighed, and his face revealed a flash of tenderness, though there also seemed to be remorse and wrath mixed with it. To put it shortly, it was an extremely complicated expression.\"Mother?\" Ling Han murmured. According to this body's memories, Ling Dong Xing had never once mentioned anything about his mother to him. Every time he asked about his mother, Ling Dong Xing would immediately change the subject. The only thing he knew was that, not long after his birth, his mother had passed away.\"In the past, I thought that the issue about your mother would forever be buried within the depths of my heart, but now-\" Ling Dong Xing paused. \"Han'er, if you can achieve Element Gathering Tier within three years' time, then I shall tell you about your mother.\"'...She, she's not dead!'A powerful excitement rose up within Ling Han's heart. The heavens were truly generous to him, not only gifting him with fatherly love, but also gifting him with the chance to obtain motherly love as well! He laughed heartily, and said, \"How difficult would that be? I don't need three years, I will be able to break through to Element Gathering Tier within three months' time!\"Ling Dong Xing was shaken. Three months to break through from the fourth layer of Body Refining Tier to Element Gathering Tier? Was this possible? Even for him, who had once been acclaimed as the greatest genius of Gray Cloud Town, it had taken a whole two years' time to make such a gigantic leap.But once he recalled that Ling Han had broken through two layers within a mere seven days\u2026 to break through to Element Gathering Tier within three months didn't look all that impossible.He was startled for a moment, before he said, \"Very well, if you can break through to Element Gathering Tier within three months, then I shall tell you everything, and you will be the one to go and rescue your mother!\"Rescue? This meant that his mother was currently confined in some place. No wonder Ling Dong Xing had always deceived him by saying his mother had passed away, so it had been a white lie!Ling Han nodded, but he still said with a smile, \"Doesn't Father want to rescue Mother with your own hands?\"Ling Dong Xing's fierce eyes widened, and he showed an excited expression, yet very quickly calmed down again. He said, \"My Spirit Base is already destroyed, I have to take Return Origin Pills just to recover Origin Power; there is no way for me to advance forward! And to save your mother would require at least the cultivation level of Flower Blossom Tier.\"Aside from the legendary Shattering Void Tier, there were in total nine tiers in martial arts, which were respectively Body Refining, Element Gathering, Gushing Spring, Spiritual Ocean, Spiritual Pedestal, Flower Blossom, Spiritual Infant, Deity Transformation and Heaven Tiers.Flower Blossom Tier\u2014the sixth tier. What kind of concept was this?The strongest warrior of the Eight Great Clans of Rain Country was only of the Spiritual Pedestal Tier, and according to the rumors, the Imperial Clan possessed extremely powerful warriors of the Flower Blossom Tier to keep watch over the central administration, which was what kept the Eight Great Clans in check, ensuring they have no thoughts of trying anything funny.Someone who had reached the cultivation of the Flower Blossom Tier would be able to start their own country to hand down to their descendants!However, to Ling Han who had once been a warrior of the Heaven Tier, so what if it was the Flower Blossom Tier? And in this new life, all of his starting conditions were even more outstanding\u2014Immortal Grade Spirit Base, Indestructible Heaven Scroll\u2026 moreover, he had already passed through all nine tiers of martial arts once, so there was no way he would encounter any kind of bottleneck, and his excellent alchemist skills would be able to provide him with all kinds of alchemical pills and medicines.Thirty years, at most, fifty years, and he would be able to once again return to the pinnacle!Ling Han laughed and said, \"Father, the Spirit Base is a part of the body, there is no such thing as being unable to heal the Spirit Base, just let me take a look.\"Ling Dong Xing stared at Ling Han for a while before he finally nodded, and said, \"Very well!\" He raised both arms as if he were holding something and, with a mental command, he projected the Spirit Base in his Dantian into open view.Ling Han was slightly shocked\u2014Ling Dong Xing's Spirit Base was surprisingly the low level Heaven Grade \"Broken Edge Sword\", of the gold alignment. No wonder that even though Ling Dong Xing had long had his Spirit Base crippled, he was still in the ninth layer of Element Gathering Tier. That was because the speed of his cultivation was very quick, and he had long since achieved this kind of cultivation level.However, currently this Broken Edge Sword had long lost its blade, and only a bit of the sword hilt was left behind. There was no possible way that it could continue to absorb Spiritual Qi, so it was practically completely destroyed.The destruction of the Spirit Base meant that it was no longer possible for the owner's martial arts to improve further.However, making it recover was of no difficulty to Ling Han.He said, \"Father, your Spirit Base can still be healed, but I currently do not have the necessary medicinal ingredients on hand, so I need some time.\"There really was hope?Ling Dong Xing could not help it as his hands tightened into fists. If he could, he would of course want to personally save his wife from her abyss of suffering, but because his Spirit Base had been destroyed, he could only place his hopes on his son.In the past, when Ling Han's Spirit Base was awakened, and yet it was revealed to be the Five Elements Disarray Spirit Base, Ling Dong Xing felt unbearably disappointed and painful. From that moment, he gave up his hopes and deceived Ling Han by saying his mother had already died, shouldering all the pain and longing by himself.\"Han'er, is what you're saying the truth?\" He asked in a trembling voice.\"Of course it's the truth,\" Ling Han replied solemnly. \"Give me three years, no, two years' time, and I will definitely find the medicinal ingredients for Father and create an alchemical pill to heal Father's Spirit Base.\"Ling Dong Xing said generously, \"Very well, then at that time, the two of us, father and son, will join forces to save your mother and reunite our family!\"\"En!\" Ling Han nodded.\"However, you will still have to obediently go to Hu Yang Academy for me!\" Ling Dong Xing suddenly switched the topic.Ling Han could not help feeling a little depressed\u2014he had already displayed such excellent talents, so why did his old man still not believe him, and compel him to go to Hu Yang Academy? However, his father's doing was all for his sake, and was well-meant.Since his father wanted him to go so much, then he'd just go. It didn't matter where he cultivated anyway. Moreover, Grey Cloud Town was too small, and could not possibly supply the cultivation resources he required anyway.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

That group of people obviously would not be giving up just like this and they'd definitely try to do something, so Ling Dong Xing needed to be prepared for it.\"I understand!\" Ling Dong Xing seemed extremely confident. He had been openly competing with Ling Zhong Kuan for many years, yet Ling Zhong Kuan could only remain as the Chief Butler, completely suppressed by him.Years ago, Ling Dong Xing also used to be a favored, proud genius, an all-powerful existence within the clan. If it was not for the destruction of his Spirit Base, someone like Ling Zhong Kuan would be nothing in his eyes.\"Heng, he dared to bully my son! If I don't beat him to the point that he has to be bedridden for a month, then my surname isn't Ling!\" He said ruthlessly, eyes cold.'So my old man is also someone who would cover for his own people!' Those words were very much to Ling Han's liking.Ling Han spoke with his father for a moment longer before leaving.As the head of a large clan, Ling Dong Xing naturally had many matters to deal with. Moreover, he still had to go and thrash Ling Zhong Kuan, that old dog who dared to take advantage of his absence to bully his son.Ling Han had no interest to see that old dog being helplessly and mercilessly thrashed by Ling Dong Xing. He returned to his room to start considering the direction he should take in the future.Cultivation would definitely require the support of alchemical pills, and the reason he had reached Heaven Tier in a mere two hundred years in his last life was because he himself was a genius alchemist. However, even a clever housewife cannot cook a meal without rice; although he now had in his hands all kinds of knowledge about alchemy, he still needed the ingredients for concocting pills.And the higher the grade of the alchemical pill, the more priceless and valuable the ingredients needed would be. Actually, if someone were to compare the Ling Clan's wealth with the cost of these ingredients\u2026 the results could be summed up with only one word: poor!He had to do something. Otherwise, the speed of his cultivation would definitely be unable to achieve the expected standard.To put it simply, he had to earn money. Ling Han currently managed to think of two ways.Firstly, sale of cultivation techniques and martial arts skills. In his last life, he had accumulated a staggering number of top-rate secret arts; should he take any one of them to an auction, he'd definitely earn an astronomical wealth. However, this was not appropriate.Because, the current Ling Han was simply much too weak.If he still had the cultivation level of Heaven Tier, then even if he released a Heaven Grade cultivation technique, others naturally would not dare to have any evil ideas. However, if he did something like that now, he would only become a target for others to force him to hand over even more cultivation techniques.If he really did have to sell any cultivation techniques or martial arts skills, he could only sell those that were not too far from his current martial arts skill level. Moreover, he couldn't sell too many at a time.Then that left only the second method, which was to sell alchemical pills.This was his original profession. Besides, alchemy was a very respected profession. Whoever dared to disrespect an alchemist could easily cause public outrage, so there would definitely be serious consideration before anyone attempted such an idiotic thing.Within the current Rain Country, at least eighty percent of the country's alchemists were involved with the Heaven's Medicine Pavilion, while the remaining twenty percent were esteemed guests of the various great clans and factions. The alchemical pills concocted by them would thus only be used by members of these great powers, without any possibility of them being sold in public.Lastly, there were a few alchemists who were loners, and were not working for any kind of power. If they lacked money, they would simply concoct alchemical pills for sale. Thus, they were completely free from any obligations.For example, in Grey Cloud Town, the supply of high-grade alchemical pills and medicines would only be found in the Heaven's Medicine Pavilion, so those who wanted to buy them could only choose to go there. Low-grade alchemical pills would be distributed for sale in batches by Heaven's Medicine Pavilion, offered to the the two Great Clans in the town. Thus, there would be mutual benefit for both the two Great Clans and the Heaven's Medicine Pavilion. After all, the two Great Clans were very influential in the area.The two Great Clans referred to Ling Clan and Cheng Clan. Both clans would be able to obtain fifty percent of the total low-grade alchemical pills from the Heaven's Medicine Pavilion respectively.However, although the two Great Clans only obtained very little profit when compared to the Heaven's Medicine Pavilion, in terms of alchemical pills, they could be said to have gained an overwhelming profit.Alchemy was an extremely high-paying profession\u2014this was also one of the reasons why alchemists would be regarded as esteemed guests by the various great powers. If the various clans and factions did not have their own alchemists, then their purchase of alchemical pills and medicines would incur a horrifyingly astronomical expense.In this life, Ling Han did not plan to exert too much effort in the path of alchemy. Thus, he only wanted to become a lone alchemist. If he lacked money, then he would concoct a few pills\u2014it was enough as long as he had sufficient funds at his disposal.'Then it's decided, I'll use alchemy as a support for my martial arts.'However, now that Ling Dong Xing had returned, Ling Han's freedom was also restricted. His old man was rushing him to immediately go to the academy.Naturally not Hu Yang Academy, but Grey Cloud Academy.Hu Yang Academy was established by the imperial clan of Rain Country, and while Grey Cloud Academy was also established by the government, there was no way to compare the two academies' resources. After all, the disparity was simply too large. However, Ling Dong Xing still had hopes that Ling Han could become an overnight celebrity in Grey Cloud Academy. All fathers naturally wanted their sons to excel and become successful people.Ling Han naturally would not want to disappoint his father, so he could only agree to go to the academy. He didn't have much to do anyway, so he'd just go to the academy for a few days and show off a bit to satisfy his father's ambition. This way, Ling Dong Xing wouldn't see any need to restrict him further.Moreover, he also wanted to realize his predecessor's long-cherished wish and clear his reputation of being a piece of trash.When he departed, Liu Yu Tong naturally was beside him, and the both of them arrived at Grey Cloud Academy. However, it was not very appropriate for Liu Yu Tong to accompany him even during classes, so she could only walk around in the academy. Her prowess also meant that she had no fear of anyone trying anything funny with her because of her extreme beauty.Ling Han walked slowly. It was not a must for him to attend classes. It was more than enough to just come to the academy. The reason why he was here was only out of respect for his father; he would not blindly obey Ling Dong Xing's every single word.Just as he came to the Martial Training Court, he could not help but pause in his steps as a strong pounding rose up within his body, causing him to, for some reason, turn and head in the direction of the Martial Training Court.This was an obsession originating from his predecessor.HIs predecessor had in total two matters that he could not let go of. The first was naturally his father, and the second was a woman within this Grey Cloud Academy. If he had not come, it would not have affected him, but now that he was here, this obsession immediately became incomparably heavy.His predecessor had once liked a woman by the name of Shen Zi Yan. She was a student of Grey Cloud Academy, and the entanglement between the two of them was an extremely complicated one.Seven years ago, when Shen Zi Yan was just a little girl at the age of ten, she had already displayed a surprising beauty. Ling Dong Xing acted quickly and arranged an engagement contract between her and Ling Han.Because the Ling Clan was one of the two Great Clans in town and Ling Han was the son of the clan's Clan Head, the Shen Clan naturally had no objection and gladly agreed to this match.However, when Ling Han was twelve, through examination, his Spirit Base was confirmed to be Five Elements Disarray Spirit Base. If it was just this, then according to the power of the Ling Clan, the Shen Clan would still not dare to have any wild thoughts. The problem was that Shen ZI Yan had a high level Earth Grade Spirit Base!Moreover, Shen Zi Yan was also extremely gifted in martial arts, so she managed to live up to such an excellent Spirit Base. As her cultivation level soared, she was regarded as a treasure by the higher-ups of the academy, who always meant to send her to Hu Yang Academy because they believed that only there would her talent truly blossom.As the two of them grew up, and the gap between Shen Zi Yan and Ling Han's cultivation levels widened ever further, she finally requested the Ling Clan to break the engagement contract.Ling Dong Xing naturally did not want to agree. This would not only be a blow to the pride of the Ling Clan, but would also break his son's heart. Yet his predecessor agreed, because his affection for his woman was bone-deep.Although they were now no more than strangers, his predecessor was still very much in love with the girl and kept on secretly paying attention to her all this while.The strength of his affection was so big that, even though his predecessor had already died, the body's instinctive reaction was to follow it, affecting the current Ling Han.'I need to get rid of this obsession\u2026 otherwise, in the future, this may become my inner demon and affect my progress,' Ling Han thought. As someone who used to be a warrior of the Heaven Tier, he naturally knew the danger an inner demon represented. 'Then I'll go to see her once more. After this, there will no longer be any relation between the two of us!' Ling Han thought, as if negotiating with his predecessor.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She was wearing a white warrior dress and her movements were as graceful as a deity's. Around her was a number of young men and women who had gathered to watch. The young women's gazes were heated whilst the men wore intoxicated expressions as they observed her practice.That young girl was Shen Zi Yan. Everyday, she would be cultivating in this location.She truly was very beautiful, but when compared to Liu Yu Tong, her beauty fell short. Moreover, Ling Han had long been used to seeing remarkably stunning beauties in his last life, so naturally he was not moved.His predecessor was a hopeless romantic. However, now that he was dead, the one in charge was he who had once been a warrior of the Heaven Tier!Ling Han took a deep breath. He felt the last remnants of his predecessor's obsessive feelings vanish into thin air. Now he was finally the one and only owner of this body.His predecessor had two things he could not let go of. One was his father, and the other was Shen Zi Yan. Now that these two obsessions have been completely neutralized, the predecessor could finally and completely \"depart\", and no longer have the slightest bit of effect over this body.In truth, his predecessor knew very well that he and Shen Zi Yan could never be, so he had only meant to secretly admire her from afar. Otherwise, if this obsession was something like wanting to marry her and no one else, Ling Han would be in big trouble.\"Get out of here!\" It was at this moment that Shen Zi Yan stopped her movements and shouted these words coldly at him.How overbearing, did she think that her family owned the Martial Training Court?Naturally, Ling Han didn't want to even bother with this kind of condescending, arrogant girl who thought the whole world revolved around her. After all, the obsession had vanished, and in his opinion, Shen Zi Yan simply could not be considered incomparably beautiful, nor was she shockingly talented. She really didn't even have the qualifications for him to consider her for one moment longer.For the sake of his predecessor, he did not react to her insulting words, and turned away, intending to leave.\"Stop right there!\" A young man dressed in embroidered clothing sprang out and, with a few steps, rushed in front of Ling Han, blocking his way. He said, \"Didn't you hear Younger Sister Disciple Shen's words? She told you to roll out of here. You don't use your legs to roll.\"His name was Cheng Hao, and he was the second son of the Clan Head of the other Great Clan in Grey Cloud Town. He was also one of Shen Zi Yan's admirers. However, Shen Zi Yan had never treated him any differently from the others. Now, he had finally found an opportunity to show off in front of her\u2014teach Ling Han a hard lesson in order to obtain Shen Zi Yan's favor.Moreover, this was not the first time he had bullied Ling Han, because among the people he could bully, Ling Han's status was the highest and thus bullying him gave him the most satisfaction.Ling Han's eyes automatically turned severe. The images of his predecessor being bullied by Cheng Hao played vividly before his eyes. Originally, he would not have bothered had Cheng Hao remained a simple face in the crowd, but now that he had spotted Cheng Hao, even if the latter had not provoked him in this manner, he had no plans of letting matters rest.\"Are you looking to die?\" He said in a murderous voice.\"Hahahaha, Ling trash, are you threatening me?\" Cheng Hao gave a laugh, yet very quickly his gaze turned severe, \"We haven't seen each other for just a few days, and now you've grown so brave that you actually dare to talk back to me?\"Everyone in the area started laughing. Ling Han's identity as a piece of trash was well-known throughout the whole academy, so these words naturally seemed like the greatest joke in the world to them.Ling Han smiled coldly and walked towards Cheng Hao.\"What is it now, are you going to beg me to spare you? If you're going to beg, then make sure you speak loudly enough,\" Cheng Hao said nonchalantly.\"Pa!\"It was at this moment that a sharp, crisp slap was heard, causing everyone's laughter to suddenly stop.Cheng Hao covered his face with one hand; his face expressed his utter disbelief. Just now, he had actually been given a slap by Ling Han... given a slap by a piece of trash!How great a humiliation was this?!He immediately entered berserk mode, and blue veins popped up all over his forehead as he said thickly, \"Are you tired of living that you actually dare to hit me?\"\"I can't hit you?\" Ling Han said calmly. His predecessor had been bullied by Cheng Hao numerous times. He was only getting back a little interest now.\"How dare you!\" Cheng Hao never thought that Ling Han would not only not beg for his life out of panic, but actually dared to talk back to him. He was originally already extremely furious, so how could he hold himself back now. He immediately raised his hand which flew towards Ling Han.The current Ling Han was in the fourth layer of Body Refining Tier. Even though that was still two layers lower than Cheng Hao, they were both in the middle stage of Body Refining Tier. With Ling Han's battle experience as someone who had once wielded the power of the Heaven Tier, how could he possibly lose?\"Pa!\" Cheng Hao had just raised his hand, but Ling Han had already reacted accordingly and his right hand flew out. Although he acted later, he reached his target earlier and, once again, another solid slap landed on Cheng Hao's face. With the great strength behind this slap, Cheng Hao staggered, causing the hand he raised to only hit empty air.\"Trash!\" Ling Han said in a calm tone, shaking his head.Everyone was silent. This label of \"trash\" originally belonged to Ling Han, but now no one could find it in themselves to laugh, for Cheng Hao had indeed been slapped twice.If the first time could be considered to be the fault of Cheng Hao's carelessness, then the second time could only be Ling Han's display of ability.But how was this possible? Wasn't Ling Han the publicly acclaimed biggest piece of trash in the whole academy?Meanwhile, Cheng Hao had been enraged to the point that both his eyes had turned red. With a great roar, he threw himself at Ling Han.However, the difference between himself and Ling Han was much too large.\"Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa!\"No matter how he attacked, Ling Han somehow managed to act later yet hit first, each slap causing him to stumble; his attack power naturally subsided by itself.\"I see now, Ling Han's power is actually not as strong as Cheng Hao's, it seems to be only somewhere around fourth or fifth layer of Body Refining Tier. However, his sixth sense is too terrifying. Every time Cheng Hao makes a move, it's as if he already knew where Cheng Hao would attack, and make the necessary adjustments in advance.\"\"Fourth or fifth layer of Body Refining Tier? That can't be, he has the Five Elements Disarray Spirit Base, so even if he wants to break through to the middle stage of the Body Refining Tier, he would only be able to achieve that at least after he's twenty.\"\"No matter what his cultivation level is, just his skill in reading attacks is scary enough!\"After watching for a period of time, the students in the area too discovered this 'secret\". The 'secret\" was actually something very simple\u2014Ling Han would predict all of Cheng Hao's attacks and react accordingly in advance to compensate for the gap between their cultivation levels.Meanwhile, Cheng Hao was completely slapped silly. There was a persistent buzzing in his head and his face was scarlet and swollen, turning it into a pig's head. Only the fury he felt kept on supporting his continuous attacks, but all of it was pointless effort.He was finally scared, and no longer dared to make any move.But how could Ling Han just let matters go like this?\"Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa!\"He kept up a furious litany of slaps, and Cheng Hao's lip very quickly was split. Fresh blood was spilled, and he looked extremely pitiful.At this moment, no one dared to step up and intervene.\"I surrender this time, don't hit me anymore,\" Cheng Hao pleaded.However, Ling Han did not stop his movements. In the past, when Cheng Hao bullied his predecessor, when had he ever been merciful? He thrashed him for a moment longer, before he said, \"Kneel!\"What?!Cheng Hao felt this was utterly absurd, this trash actually dared tell him to kneel? If he really knelt, then not only would his pride be completely shattered, even the Cheng Clan would be laughed at by others. After all, he was the second son of the Cheng Clan's Clan Head!This was too much, even when he and his older brother had bullied Ling Han in the past, they had only dared to thrash the other until his whole body was covered with injuries. They had not dared to make the other kneel down.This could possibly spark off a blood feud between the two clans!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He could not and would not yield on this matter.Ling Han laughed thickly and said, \"And here I was afraid you might yield and cause me to have no more reason to kill you!\"'This, this, this, this guy wants to kill me?'Cheng Hao's whole body shivered. He looked at Ling Han only to see a harsh expression on his face. He was obviously not joking. He couldn't control the trembling of his body and said, \"Do you want to induce a blood feud between the two Great Clans? Do you want to become the greatest sinner in the history of the Ling Clan?\"\"A tiny little Cheng Clan, and you think you're worthy of flopping around in front of me?\" Ling Han said disdainfully, \"If your Cheng Clan dare to make a move, I will eliminate the whole lot of you!\"Boom, everyone in the surrounding area erupted with voices.What big words! The Ling and the Cheng were both powerful clans in Gray Cloud Town; their strength was fairly equal, and should there be a dispute between the two, neither side would win and would only come off worse. As a result, although the two clans both had the desire to get rid of the other and thus gain sole authority over Gray Cloud Town, neither dared to make the first move.Ling Han, this trash, actually said that he would single-handedly eliminate the Cheng Clan, was he joking?However, looking at the fierce look on Ling Han's face at the moment, his whole body exuding an indescribable might, for some reason, it caused everyone in the area to become speechless. They all had the same feeling, and that was the young man in front of them at this moment was no longer the so-called trash they knew.There were even some girls whose gazes had grown bright. How manly, their knees actually felt a little weak.\"How boastful of you, there isn't need for anyone else, my older brother alone would be able to single-handedly suppress you!\" Cheng Hao shouted, his whole expression filled with obstinate defiance.In his eyes, Ling Han was only a toy that had been bullied numerous times by him and his older brother, Cheng Xiang. Now that Ling Han had turned the tables on him to suppress him, this was something that he could not accept in any way or manner.\"Pa!\"Ling Han gave him another slap, and asked in an awe-inspiring tone, \"So you really want to die then?\"If the Cheng Clan intended to make any kind of retaliation against him, he would not mind eliminating the Cheng Clan using this opportunity\u2014considering Zhu He Xin's respect towards him, having him take action naturally would only be a small issue. And while Zhu He Xin was no genius in martial arts, he at least had the cultivation of the Gushing Spring Tier. It would be a piece of cake for him to eliminate the Cheng Clan.So should the Cheng Clan want to bring about their own destruction so desperately, he would not mind using Zhu He Xin to get rid of them.Cheng Hao could not help himself as cold sweat rolled down his face. In front of Ling Han, he felt an incomparable pressure, and also felt the threat of imminent death. This young man in front of him was no longer the Ling Han of the past, whom he had bullied numerous times... he was now a terrifying God of Death!\"Pa!\" He could not help the weakening of his legs as he knelt on the ground. Faced with the choice between his life and his pride, he would cast away his pride without any second thought.After all, once you die, everything is over.He really knelt down!The whole area was in an uproar. Cheng Hao was the Second Young Master of the Cheng Clan, and could to a large degree represent the entire Cheng Clan\u2014someone like that had actually knelt down! Moreover, the one he was kneeling down in front of was a member of the clan which was Cheng Clan's enemy! This could practically be engraved on the Cheng Clan's plaque of dishonor!So Cheng Hao was actually someone who would bully the weak but tremble before the strong... why did no one realize his cowardly character in the past? Everyone wanted to know the answer...But after thinking it over, this was quite normal. After all, Cheng Hao had always been in the spotlight as the Second Young Master of the Cheng Clan, who would dare oppose him? Thus, of course it would be impossible for anyone to find out that, underneath his overbearing, arrogant exterior, he was actually a big coward!But Ling Han really was too overbearing, he had actually forced the Second Young Master of the Cheng Clan to kneel down, wasn't he afraid of provoking a great war between the two clans?\"So cool!\" The numerous girls that were already infatuated and lovestruck because of Ling Han's previous actions shrieked loudly.\"Ling Han, have you done enough!\" Cheng Hao said with gritted teeth. There was only one thought in his head at this moment, and that was to leave this location, then come charging back with his older brother, regaining his lost pride and avenging the dishonor and insult he had suffered.\"Crawl out of here!\" Ling Han said calmly.\"What!\" Cheng Hao thought that he had heard wrongly.\"Pa!\" Ling Han gave a kick to Cheng Hao's back, forcing him to hold himself up with both hands on the ground.\"Ling Han, you dare insult me in this way, I want to kill you! Kill you!\" Cheng Hao was about to go mad. Kneeling down was already the greatest insult he could imagine, but if he also had to actually drop onto the ground like this? And actually crawl out of here?\"So what if I insult you? Trash!\" Ling Han said coldly. Haven't the Cheng brothers insulted him enough in the past?The reason why the Cheng brothers dared to act that way was because they were stronger than his predecessor, and the adults definitely could not interfere in this kind of dispute amongst the younger generation\u2014at least as long as there was no death or permanent injury. Otherwise, they would be laughed at by others.\"You either crawl out of here, or you die here, make your choice,\" Ling Han said.So domineering, was this really the Ling Han they knew?Everyone was struck dumb and speechless. In the past, they had all laughed at Ling Han for being a piece of trash, but what kind of trash would actually dare to force the second son of the Cheng Clan to kneel down and crawl like a dog in public?He was freaking awesome!Cheng Hao was sweating like crazy. He had no desire to become a sinner of the clan, and even more didn't want to be shamed in public. However, facing the possibility of death, his willpower was simply too weak. Very quickly, he moved his hands, starting to crawl on the ground.\"Hahahaha!\" Everyone around them started laughing. Suddenly it was as if the laughter was contagious, causing even more people to start following their lead and laugh.The Second Young Master of the Cheng Clan crawling around like a dog, this was not something that could be seen every day!Cheng Hao's tears gushed out instantly, he gripped his fists tightly, and swore in his heart, that he would definitely kill Ling Han! Definitely! He crawled for more than ten steps, then immediately pushed up from the ground, and rushed out of the Martial Training Court.He wanted to find his older brother, Cheng Xiang, and kill Ling Han! Kill! Kill! Kill!\"Pa, pa, pa!\" Applause rose up and attracted everyone's attention. Everyone fell silent and looked towards the slender, beautiful girl who just clapped her hands.Shen Zi Yan stopped clapping,and said, \"I have to admit, this was a very exciting performance. However, do you think you can move me with something like this? You're deluding yourself, don't think I don't know what your intentions are. Unfortunately, the gap between you and I is far too wide; you can't even compare to my little finger, to be liked by someone like you is a complete insult to myself!\"\"You think too highly of yourself! Idiot!\" Ling Han shook his head. For the sake of his predecessor, he did not want to bother with his foolish girl.\"With my talent in martial arts, I will definitely be famous in future, and create miracles even though I am a girl!\" Shen Zi Yan said loftily. \"You do not have to say anything anymore, I know that everything you have done was to attract my interest, but very unfortunately, I will never look at a small character like you! Everything between us has long ended!I don't mind telling you, I've already obtained the invitation to Hu Yang Academy, and will officially become a disciple of Hu Yang Academy next year!You, a mere piece of trash, actually dare to like me? You are not qualified! Not qualified! Not qualified!\"Fine, she can say everything she wants.Liking her\u2026. en, that was the natural course of events. She was beautiful and extremely gifted in martial arts, so she must definitely be admired. If you say you don't like her, damn, then you must be deliberately saying contrary words to attract her attention.To be narcissistic to this point, she was definitely a weirdo.Even Ling Han was struck speechless. Usually when he's faced with this kind of shameless person, he would directly give a good, solid slap.Ninth layer of Body Refining Tier, a bit challenging, but not impossible.Ling Han's eyes grew cold, and he was just about to walk over when his eyes fell upon a beautiful figure walking slowly into the Martial Training Court.Liu Yu Tong!She was an extraordinarily beautiful woman who would become the focus of everything wherever she went. Very quickly, everyone's attention was attracted by her beautiful figure. Suddenly, everyone put on a stunned expression\u2014she was so beautiful!Shen Zi Yan was indeed a beautiful girl, but when compared with this person, she fell short. Moreover, this girl had an indescribably graceful bearing, as if she was a noble princess. In comparison, Shen Zi Yan's so-called beauty was overshadowed to the point she looked like a village girl.At this moment, there was only one thought in everyone's heart\u2014who was she?Was she a goddess come down from the heavens? How could her beauty be so cool and elegant? Those who dared to have any thoughts about her felt like they were committing blasphemy.Under everyone's dumbstruck stares, Liu Yu Tong had already passed Ling Han by and, without a single pause, continued walking forwards.This was natural, if Liu Yu Tong had actually stopped, they would have been even more shocked\u2014a mere piece of trash, how could he possibly have any relation to this cool and elegant goddess?Shen Zi Yan felt great pressure. The other's beauty caused even her to feel her own inferiority in comparison, causing her to go mad with jealousy.The other was not just a little bit more beautiful than her. In all the categories: looks, figure and demeanor, she was completely overwhelmed, so no matter how much she didn't want to admit it, she could only grit her teeth in secret.Liu Yu Tong stopped in front of Shen Zi Yan, and with a wave of her hand, a slap sounded against the other's face.\"Pa!\" Crisp, loud and clear.\"You-\" Shen Zi Yan was slapped stupid, but she immediately flared up in fury. With a wave of her right hand, a similar slap flew towards Liu Yu Tong.But what could the ninth layer of Body Refining Tier do against the ninth layer of Element Gathering Tier?\"Pa!\" Liu Yu Tong's hand once again rose and flew down, and another solid slap resounded against Shen Zi Yan's face a second time.With these two slaps, Shen Zi Yan's beautiful hair was messed up, her beautiful face swollen, and she looked a little poignant, but her eyes were filled with fury and poison, as if she wanted to devour someone. She gave a sharp scream and once again, attacked Liu Yu Tong.But this was obviously pointless effort.\"Pa, pa, pa!\"She was repeatedly slapped, as if she was a doll without any ability of retaliation.Everyone gasped, these two girls seemed to be about the same age, so why was the difference in ability between them so wide? Who on earth was this icy beauty, and why was she, for some reason, slapping Shen Zi Yan?\"What right do you have to be proud?\" Liu Yu Tong asked coldly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What about you?\u201d\u201cPu!\"These words caused everyone to gasp in astonishment.The ninth layer of Element Gathering Tier... what kind of concept was that?Only the strongest of the strong in Gray Cloud Town had this kind of cultivation level!Shen Zi Yan was indeed a genius. Those who had achieved the ninth layer of Body Refining Tier at the age of seventeen were definitely an uncommon existence in the history of Gray Cloud Town. On average, there would only be two or three of such geniuses every one hundred years, and each one of them demonstrated extraordinary talent in their lifetime, going on to become famous and leave their mark in the history of Rain Country.But when compared with Liu Yu Tong, Shen Zi Yan couldn\u2019t even hold a candle to the former!A seventeen-year-old managed to achieve the ninth layer of Element Gathering Tier\u2026 even in the vast territory of Rain Country, how many such geniuses would appear in one hundred years?Liu Yu Tong no longer suppressed her power, and released the majestic aura of a warrior in the ninth layer of Element Gathering Tier. In an instant, everyone in the surrounding area could sense the strength hidden within her body.Shen Zi Yan bore the brunt of it as the one closest to Liu Yu Tong. Underneath this powerful aura, she abruptly lowered her head. She wasn\u2019t even qualified to look directly at Liu Yu Tong. This was unacceptable to the arrogant Shen Zi Yan, and as she struggled to raise her head to look directly at her opponent, her eyes were filled with fear, despair and confusion.Why was there suddenly an appearance of someone her own age, but with both beauty and brilliant talent that even she had no choice but to admit her inferiority? Furthermore, why had such a person given her a slap out of the blue?\u201cHow dare you look down on him!\u201d Liu Yu Tong spoke, turning to point at Ling Han, and once more turned to look at Shen Zi Yan, \u201cYou\u2019re completely unqualified!\u201dWhat, she was here to defend Ling Han?Whether it was Shen Zi Yan or everyone else, they were all in a state of complete disbelief.This girl with elegant and noble bearing, unparalleled beauty and shocking talent in martial arts was actually acquainted with Trash Ling? Being acquainted with each other was inconceivable enough, and yet she had actually defended Ling Han! How could anyone accept this?Especially the guys in the area, they all felt like they were about to die of jealousy!Shen Zi Yan gritted her teeth, her eyes spitting fire. She had now transferred all her fury onto Ling Han.That was because Liu Yu Tong was too strong, and she dared not have even the slightest thought of revenge.However, Ling Han was a different story. With his cultivation level at the fourth layer of Body Refining Tier, in her eyes, he could be finished off in a single blow.Moreover, everything was because of Ling Han. He had deliberately made fun of her, so she spoke to him in mockery. As a result, she was publicly slapped by Liu Yu Tong, and had disgraced herself.However, in truth, had she not insulted Ling Han in the first place, he would have long left. Then the subsequent course of events would never have happened.But with her self-centered personality, how could she possibly reflect on her own behavior? So naturally she would push all the fault onto another person\u2019s shoulders.She pointed at Ling Han, and spoke shrilly, \u201cIn what way am I not qualified? Isn\u2019t this guy just a piece of trash?Trash?Have you seen a piece of trash that could break through two layers within a single night? And what kind of trash would cause a Black Grade alchemist to beg just to be able to follow by his side?Naturally Liu Yu Tong did not intend to inform Shen Zi Yan about any of this, so she only said, \u201cSuch a short-sighted woman like yourself naturally cannot see that underneath the dust lies gold, underneath the darkness hides a pearl. You have already missed out on your chance, so there\u2019s no point to pointing out his brightness to you.\u201dAs she spoke, Liu Yu Tong felt a little irritated\u2014Ling Han had actually admired a woman like this!Of course, she would never admit that she was jealous.\u201cHahahaha!\u201d Shen Zi Yan laughed loudly before pointing at Ling Han and said, \u201cHe\u2019s gold, he\u2019s a pearl? What kind of joke are you playing! He\u2019s nothing more but a piece of trash, a complete, utter piece of trash!\u201d\u201cIn less than three months, he will become someone that all of you would only be able to look up to!\u201d Liu Yu Tong said assuredly. She did not know why Ling Han had kept such a low profile in the past, but now he was obviously going to display his brilliance, dazzling to the point that the sun would look pale in comparison.Hearing these words, everyone sneered. Although Ling Han had truly defeated Cheng Hao, but his actual cultivation level was only the fourth layer of Body Refining Tier, or the fifth layer, at most. Although this kind of cultivation level was not considered trash, it was still very far off from being proclaimed as a genius... not to mention actually becoming someone that everyone would only look up to.\u201cEn?\u201d Liu Yu Tong\u2019s almond eyes widened. The aura of a warrior of ninth layer of Element Gathering Tier trembled slightly, and suddenly all the taunting laughter came to a complete stop.\u201cLing Han, how dare you!\u201d At this moment, a furious roar was heard as two figures quickly rushed into the Martial Training Court.One of the figures was none other than Cheng Hao. The other figure seemed to be slightly older than him, with a few similarities in their features.This was Cheng Hao\u2019s older brother, Cheng Xiang, currently nineteen years old, ninth layer of Body Refining Tier.Both were at the ninth layer of Body Refining Tier. One was seventeen, the other was nineteen, there was no comparison between their respective natural talent. Of course, a nineteen-year-old who has achieved the ninth layer of Body Refining Tier would still be able to claim the title of a genius in Gray Cloud Town, although he was not as extraordinary as Shen Zi Yan.\u201cPeng, peng, peng, peng,\u201d Cheng Xiang\u2019s steps echoed loudly, hinting at his current terrifying state of utter fury. He stopped about three meters away from Ling Han, pointed at him, and said, \u201cWhat despicable means have you used?\u201dLing Han smiled coldly, and said, \u201cSo I won only because I made use of despicable means?\u201d\u201cOf course, otherwise, how could a piece of trash like you ever defeat my younger brother?\u201d Cheng Xiang spoke loudly. Unlike Ling Han\u2019s infamous reputation as a piece of trash, if today\u2019s issue was not appropriately handled, the Cheng Clan\u2019s reputation would definitely be seriously impacted.Thus, whether it was true that Ling Han had made use of despicable means or not, he had to insist that he had done so.Hearing the word \u201ctrash\u201d, everyone\u2019s expressions became very strange.Shen Zi Yan had just said something similar, and the result was being repeatedly slapped by Liu Yu Tong. This elite warrior of the ninth layer of Element Gathering Tier is still here, and you actually dare to publicly curse at Ling Han? Isn\u2019t this just asking for trouble?With Ling Han\u2019s experience, he naturally could tell with a glance what Cheng Xiang\u2019s intentions were. He did not reveal them though, and only slowly said, \u201cOh, then how do I prove that I did not make use of those despicable means you\u2019re speaking of?\u201d\u201cHeng, you used despicable means to bully my younger brother. As an older brother, how can I pretend that I did not see anything? Since you\u2019re so brave, then I dare you to spar with me!\u201d Cheng Xiang obviously came well-prepared.Everyone could not help thinking, \u2018How shameless!\u2019You are already in the ninth layer of Body Refining Tier, while Ling Han is only in the fourth layer of Body Refining Tier. The difference of five layers, how could he compare to you?However, as long as Ling Han was given a harsh beating, it would weaken the degree of embarrassment caused by Cheng Hao\u2019s previous actions, and also help to avenge Cheng Hao. This was a very smart move, and could be said to be hitting two birds with one stone.Ling Han\u2019s smile disappeared and he shook his head, saying, \u201cYou are in the ninth layer of Body Refining Tier, while I\u2019m only in the fourth layer of Body Refining Tier, doesn\u2019t this seem very unjust?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t mind if you find someone to take your place in the spar!\u201d Cheng Hao laughed loudly. Naturally, he was very familiar with Ling Han\u2019s label as trash. With such reputation, no one would befriend him in the whole academy, so where on earth could he find anyone to help him?Furthermore, even if he did find someone to help him, what about it? Cheng Hao was in the ninth layer of Body Refining Tier, and was one of the strongest in the academy. What did he have to fear?Everyone\u2019s expressions once more became very strange. Ling Han really did have someone in his corner, furthermore, that someone was an extremely strong warrior of the ninth layer of Element Gathering Tier that could, in one move, instantly kill a person in the ninth layer of Body Refining Tier!Wasn\u2019t this just looking for death?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Seeing this incredibly stunning icy beauty, he couldn't help but stare.How was it possible that such a beautiful woman existed in this world?Wait, did she just say she would be taking Ling Han's place in the spar?A powerful feeling of jealousy and anger arose within Cheng Xiang. What right did a piece of trash like Ling Han have to possess such a beautiful woman? This was unjust and completely laughable!He quickly said, \"Miss, you must be new here, and must have been deceived by this guy's pretty words. He is the trash from Ling Clan, this is something that everyone in this academy knows very well.\"A fiery anger immediately flashed in Liu Yu Tong's beautiful eyes. She could not help getting angered when she heard these people insult Ling Han.What right do these people have to insult him in this way?\"Don't, just now it was a woman, so I did not mind you doing my work for me. But now the opponent is a man, and a duel between men should be settled between men,\" Ling Han said with a shake of his head, one hand placed on Liu Yu Tong's shoulder.Seeing such a scene, everyone in the area, even the females, felt that they were about to go mad with jealousy.Ling Han actually had such intimate contact with their goddess! What enraged them even further was the fact that Liu Yu Tong actually did not appear to resist it it all!Liu Yu Tong frowned slightly. Cheng Xiang was different from Cheng Hao by far. The former was in the ninth layer of Body Refining Tier, and thus his cultivation level exceeded Ling Han's by a whole five layers! She knew Ling Han could perform miracles and possessed the ability to bypass the limitations of cultivation levels to challenge those much stronger than him, but the difference between him and his current opponent was really too large this time!In her opinion, the chance of Ling Han winning was close to zero!\"Don't worry, you should have more faith in me!\" Ling Han said with a smile.\"Then let's spar,\" Cheng Xiang said. He did not know how Ling Han had \"bewitched\" Liu Yu Tong, but he believed that once he had publicly defeated Ling Han, this extremely stunning beauty would naturally be able to see Ling Han's true colors.Ling Han once again nodded towards Liu Yu Tong, and the icy beauty finally stepped back.This little female attendant of his was really quite interesting.Ling Han smiled. Once he turned towards Cheng Xiang though, his expression became cautious.The gap of a whole five layers was big, very big. If Liu Yu Tong suppressed her power to the fourth layer of Body Refining Tier and battled with Cheng Xiang, she would only be able to grit her teeth in defeatLing Han dared to accept this challenge because he knew a martial arts technique called Lone Wolf's Blood\u2014with every injury, the user would be able to erupt with power that surpassed his actual cultivation level. The heavier the injury, the stronger the power he erupted with would be.In his past life, Ling Han would only be able to take a large amount of alchemical medicines and pills to heal his injuries, but currently, he had no such healing medicines. But that was okay, because he now possessed an even more powerful secret art.Indestructible Heaven Scroll!\"Come!\" Ling Han beckoned with a finger. He was calm\u2014he had already cast away the glory of a warrior of the Heaven Tier, the current him was only a minor martial artist of the fourth layer of Body Refining Tier. Everything was back to square one.Cheng Xiang naturally would not treat Ling Han seriously. He started to casually circle around Ling Han, a cold smile on his face. He could easily, effortlessly suppress a mere minor character of the fourth layer of Body Refining Tier.\"Brother, thrash him!\" Cheng Hao could not help calling out. Presently, his face hurt a lot. Moreover, he had even been forced to kneel and crawl around like a dog in front of everyone, making an embarrassment out of himself. He was naturally filled with furious hatred towards Ling Han.There was one person who shared that feeling, and that was Shen Zi Yan. She too hated Ling Han to the bone.Cheng Xiang nodded, and said, \"All of you should take a good look, this is what happens to all who dare to defy our Cheng Clan!\" The corners of his lips lifted upwards in a cruel smile, and a powerful punch flew towards Ling Han.Ling Han gave a snort and clenched his fist before similarly flying towards his opponent.What!?Seeing such a scene, everyone thought that Ling Han had gone crazy.A head-on power battle between the fourth layer and the ninth layer of Body Refining Tier, this was an extremely stupid move.Previously, wasn't Ling Han very smart? With his fearful ability to foresee attacks, he easily dispersed Cheng Hao's attacks' power, and thrashed the latter like he was a dog. But now against the much stronger Cheng Xiang, he actually cast away this kind of battle technique?Did he think he would not lose fast enough?At this moment, even Liu Yu Tong felt she was about to lose faith in Ling Han, because this kind of power battle was the purest, truest display of the strength of cultivation levels and disparity in strength.Only Ling Han was filled with confidence. He of course would not be deliberately looking to be beaten.'Come!'\"Peng!\" The two fists crashed into each other. If the movement was slowed down by a hundred times, it could be clearly seen that, underneath the jolt of power, the skin on Ling Han's arm rose and fell like the water's surface from his fist all the way to his shoulder. Following a \"pa pa pa pa\" sound, the rupturing of arteries caused his whole arm to instantly become badly mangled.The power gap truly was much too wide.\"Teng, teng, teng,\" Ling Han retreated a whole seven steps before he finally regained his balance.\"Hahahaha, trash will always be trash!\" Cheng Xiang laughed coldly. Ever since Ling Han had entered the academy, he had become the target of bullying for him and Cheng Hao. Ling Han thought he could bring about a change in his fate now? In his dreams!Ling Han's face was completely expressionless as the Indestructible Heaven Scroll continued to circulate within his body and the injury of his arm rapidly healed. However, due to the fresh blood covering his arm, his quickly recovering injuries could not be seen. And with his injury, Lone Wolf's Blood also started to circulate within his body, causing his power to rise to a new level.Fifth layer of Body Refining Tier!Ling Han gave a shout and once again took the initiative, rushing towards Cheng Xiang.\"It's no use, Ling Trash, you will be a piece of trash your whole life!\" Cheng Xiang laughed loudly and his fist flew towards Ling Han once again.\"Peng!\"The fifth layer of Body Refining Tier would still be vulnerable against the ninth layer of Body Refining Tier, so once again, Ling Han was forced to retreat, spilling fresh blood. The right arm that had just healed became badly mangled once again.Cheng Xiang looked a little surprised, because he sensed that his opponent's power had increased by a large margin compared to the previous attack, although he was still much weaker than himself.Ling Han simultaneously circulated Indestructible Heaven Scroll and stimulated Lone Wolf's Blood. His eyes shone like a battle wolf's, filled with killing intent.Sixth layer of Body Refining Tier!Injury upon injury, Ling Han's power once again increased.He roared and once again threw himself at Cheng Xiang.Cheng Xiang's strength was extraordinary, but underneath Ling Han's stare, he actually felt a little frightened. He immediately grew angered\u2014this was a piece of trash! For him to actually feel a even a bit of dread towards a piece of trash\u2026 it was completely laughable!He wanted to defeat Ling Han in one attack and injure him heavily, so that the latter wouldn't be able to get up again.\"Peng! Peng! Peng! Peng!\"The two fighters continuously attacked each other. Naturally, Ling Han was at the obvious disadvantage and, with every encounter, his opponent would cause him to suffer heavy injuries. And yet, he would immediately regain his battle spirit each time and retaliate. HIs determination was unbelievable.Moreover, Ling Han's attacks were becoming fiercer and stronger, and slowly, he was actually able to fight on even footing with Cheng Xiang.Seventh layer of Body Refining Tier!Cheng Xiang was very clear on the fact that Ling Han's power had shockingly risen to the level of seventh layer of Body Refining Tier. Thankfully though, after increasing to such a degree, Ling Han's power did not increase any further. Otherwise, Cheng Xiang would truly start to feel fear.It couldn't be helped. After all, the Lone Wolf's Blood also had its limits\u2014it could only help Ling Han increase his power by three layers.However, the seventh layer of Body Refining Tier against the ninth layer of Body Refining Tier, the gap in power had shrunk to only two layers' difference!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His temporary increase in power to the seventh layer of Body Refining Tier was obtained through sustaining serious injuries. He was now like an injured lone wolf\u2014the more he was injured, the more he refused to surrender.At first, it was as if the crowd was there just to watch a free show. But when they saw Ling Han being repeatedly injured yet continue to retaliate, their feelings, for some reason, were affected by his performance.Even if Ling Han was a piece of trash, he was a piece of trash that deserved their respect!What kind of person could have such determination and unyielding will?To be unyielding even as his blood spilled, to be dauntless facing any and all setbacks!Before they knew it, everyone's thoughts started to lean towards Ling Han, secretly hoping that he would emerge victorious.In the world of martial artists, the weak did not deserve to be pitied, but an unyielding warrior would be able to gain respect. Ling Han used his blood and strong will to obtain something that his predecessor had longed for the most...Respect!This was also the reason why Ling Han had stubbornly decided to fight this battle, and even chosen such a 'stupid\" method, a head-on clash.Of course, only he was aware that his current condition was not as horrible as everyone was thinking\u2014Indestructible Heaven Scroll was circulating within his body and continuously healing his injuries, so they looked much worse than they in fact were.However, even if they already somewhat recovered by now, the injuries he suffered were in no way faked. He was in agonizing pain, as if a fire was slowly burning up his spirit, but it was also this pain that allowed him to erupt with power that far exceeded his actual cultivation level.He had to continuously take Return Origin Pills, battle and keep up the continuous circulation of Indestructible Heaven Scroll. All this led to too large a depletion of his Origin Power.Ling Han was repeatedly forced to retreat, but he would keep on charging back into battle. As his fresh blood splattered, his indomitable willpower had affected a large part of the surrounding crowd. Some of the girls had even started shedding tears, asking Ling Han to stop fighting.\"Why won't you fall!\" The longer Cheng Xiang fought, the more flustered he became. How could Ling Han be so determined? Why was it that, no matter how much he was wounded, he refused to fall\u2026? This fight put a great pressure on Cheng Xiang. The power of the seventh layer of Body Refining Tier was enough to be a threat to him, and with the repeated confrontations between them, his internal organs were also boiling over, causing him extreme discomfort.He roared and attacked with both his fists. He had finally used a martial art skill, wanting to take down Ling Han as fast as possible!It was one of Cheng Clan's special skills\u2014Expert Armed Fist.Double peaks piercing the ear! [1]A martial artist that uses martial art skills and a martial artist that does not are at two completely different levels of power. Just like cultivation techniques, martial arts skills could also be categorized into Heaven, Earth, Black and Yellow Grades respectively. A good Yellow Grade martial arts skill can roughly double the user's power.Every major grade was further divided into three minor levels\u2014high, medium, and low. For example, a Yellow Grade low level martial art skill would increase the user's power by around thirty percent, a medium level one would be able to raise the user's power by around forty to sixty percent, while a high level skill would increase the user's power around seventy to one hundred percent.The Expert Armed FIst was a Yellow Grade medium level martial art skill. It could increase the user's power by around fifty percent, and the last three secret moves could increase the user's power by up to sixty percent!Ling Han knew countless martial arts skills, even the rarely seen Heaven Grade high level martial arts skills\u2014he knew seven of them and each could increase the user's power by ten times! However, due to the limitations of his current power level, he had no way to use these skills.It was not just Heaven Grade skills that he couldn't use. Even Earth Grade or Black Grade skills were also out of the question for him due to his current limited cultivation.So, he could only use Yellow Grade martial arts skills.To use Black Grade martial arts skills, the user had to at least have the cultivation level of Gushing Spring Tier.He tightened both fists, and moved into an attacking stance.High level Yellow Grade martial arts skill, Dashing Panther Fist!\"Peng!\"A loud noise was heard, and the two fighters had already exchanged their attacks. Their speed was extremely fast\u2014aside from Liu Yu Tong, only a few of the students who happened to have the cultivation of the ninth layer of Body Refining Tier could see it clearly. Meanwhile, the majority of the crowd could only see that, after this confrontation, Cheng Xiang's body somehow flew outwards.\"Si!\" Everyone in the area was struck speechless as they sharply breathed in.Cheng Xiang had actually flown out due to the force behind Ling Han's attack... what kind of unfathomable event was this?Meanwhile, even though Ling Han's body was entirely covered in fresh blood, he had only taken a few steps backward.What a grand reversal of the situation!What was going on? Cheng Xiang had had the upper hand all this while, so why was it that he was actually horribly defeated once he used a martial arts skill?But no matter how far their thoughts travelled, none of them would be able to guess that Ling Han had just used a high level Yellow Grade martial art skill.How could that be possible? Even the two Great Clans of Gray Cloud Town only possessed medium level Yellow Grade martial arts skills. If an ordinary person managed to learn a low level Yellow Grade martial arts skill, he'd already die happy!Only Liu Yu Tong's beautiful eyes flashed with understanding. She was the only person who clearly knew that Three Yin Mysterious Arts Ling Han taught her was a Heaven Grade cultivation technique. Thus, what would be strange about Ling Han knowing a high level Yellow Grade martial arts skill?Cheng Xiang moaned, wanting to get back up. However, the power behind Ling Han's attack was really terrifying. Even just moving caused him to continuously throw up blood!Just now, when they repeatedly exchanged their attacks, Cheng Xiang's internal organs had already suffered from huge tremors, and the one attack just moments ago had immediately caused all the damage he had already sustained to blow up. This was a deciding attack that transformed quantity into quality!\"No, this isn't possible!\" Cheng Hao's expression was one of utter disbelief. His older brother was an elite of the ninth layer of Body Refining Tier, how could he lose to a piece of trash?This was definitely not real!Ling Han walked towards Cheng Xiang. With every step, the injuries he had suffered were quickly healing. Once he was right in front of Cheng Xiang, all the injuries were fully healed, a testament to the great power of Indestructible Heaven Scroll.\"I, I've lost!\" With everyone looking at them, there was no way for Cheng Xiang to deny the fact that he had lost. He glared ferociously at Ling Han, his face filled with denial. He could not understand how Ling Han had defeated him.Ling Han slowly raised his leg, moving it above Cheng Xiang.\"You, what are you planning to do?\" Cheng Xiang could not help revealing a fearful expression. Was Ling Han planning to step on his face? \"Don't go too far!\"\"Too far?\" Ling Han snorted, one foot already firmly placed on Cheng Xiang's face, \"You, as a cultivator of the ninth layer of Body Refining Tier, fighting with me... it isn't considered 'too far'? The first thing your younger brother told me was to get lost, and the first thing you did was to accuse me of using despicable means... isn't that considered 'too far'?So you're the only ones allowed to do as you like? There is no such logic on this world!Since your skills are inferior, you should speak less rubbish!\"He put more strength into his foot and Cheng Xiang immediately let out a pained groan. However, what he felt more was shame\u2014he had actually been trampled underneath someone's foot! Furthermore, this person was the publicly acknowledged trash of the academy! Of course, after today, Ling Han would definitely be able to clear his name as a piece of trash, but this all came at the price of stepping on Cheng Xiang's face. This was even more unacceptable to Cheng Xiang.People in the surrounding area too were lost for words.Before this, they had only hoped that Ling Han would emerge victorious, but who amongst them had truly believed that Ling Han would win?They could not help recalling Liu Yu Tong's words\u2014in less than three months, Ling Han would become an existence that all of them could only look up to!Perhaps, three months might not even be necessary. Presently, there was already quite a number of them looking up to him!\"Ling Han, you will definitely regret this!\" Cheng Xiang said in a furious, poisonous voice. To actually be trampled beneath the foot of a piece of trash, this was a shame that he would never be able to clear from his reputation.\"Is that so?\" Ling Han smiled faintly, this kind of threat was completely meaningless on him. \"Beg for mercy!\" he said, \"If your attitude is sincere enough, I will spare you, otherwise, you may have to lie down here for quite a long time!\"\"You-\" Cheng Xiang felt as if he was about to explode. Ling Han actually wanted him to beg for mercy in front of all these people?[1] ED/N: Alternate translation is twin peaks piercing/passing through the ear(s). For obvious reasons, that is not the appropriate one here, but I thought it would be interesting to share that\u2026 it's likely a pun on the part of the author.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Lying down is nothing too tiring, anyway!\" Ling Han spoke calmly.He has always been the kind of person to return the kindness of others tenfold; however, he was also the type that, if offended, would return it back by ten times as well.Since Cheng Xiang and his brother wanted to bully him, then he would trample all over them, making them into complete fools.Lying down isn't tiring?Lying down indeed was not tiring, but if there was a foot stepping on your face, then the issue was no longer about whether it was tiring or not.Cheng Xiang gritted his teeth tightly to the point that even his gums started bleeding. \"Ka ka ka,\" the grinding of his teeth could clearly be heard. If he could, he really wanted to tear Ling Han into a million pieces, but for now, he could only lower his prideful head and say, \"I'm sorry, please, spare me!\"\"You're speaking too softly, I can't hear you,\" Ling Han said calmly.\"I'm sorry, please spare me!\" Cheng Xiang cried out loudly. As these words left his mouth, he felt as if his entire person was about to fall apart. All his pride, dignity and self-esteem as the Eldest Young Master of the Cheng Clan had all dispersed like the popping of a bubble along with this plea for mercy.\"Be more sensible in future, there are some people that you can't afford to offend!\" Ling Han said, taking back his leg. \"You should feel fortunate that I'm in a generous mood now.\"This was considered generous?Everyone was lost for words. Cheng Xiang was not Cheng Hao, he was the Eldest Young Master of the Cheng Clan. To shame him in such a public setting was the same as slapping the whole Cheng Clan! This would definitely not be settled peacefully.There would definitely arise a fierce battle between the Cheng and the Ling Clans; it might even become a blood feud between the two clans. It would become complete chaos.Shen Zi Yan looked on, her white teeth biting fiercely on her red lips. Her current feelings were indescribably complex.They were both in the ninth layer of Body Refining Tier, but there was a large gap between their individual ability. For example, she too had defeated many experienced martial artists in the ninth layer of Body Refining Tier, so even if Ling Han was able to defeat Cheng Xiang, that did not mean that he could defeat her.But the problem was, what was Ling Han's current cultivation level?When this guy too rose up to the ninth layer of Body Refining Tier, who amongst those of the whole Body Refining Tier would be able to fight with him on an equal footing?To be invincible amongst those of the same tier, that was the quality of a ruler!No, she definitely did not have any regrets. This was a piece of trash, a piece of trash that she had already rejected a few years ago! A piece of trash that could only look up to her throughout his whole life!***Ling Han walked out of the Martial Training Court, Liu Yu Tong by his side as per usual. The two strolled around the academy for a while. After that, they sat down beneath a large tree. Leaning against the tree trunk, neither of them spoke.After a while, Liu Yu Tong finally couldn't bear it anymore and said, \"I never thought that you had such poor eyes, to actually like that kind of shallow, self-centred girl!\"Ling Han couldn't hold back his hearty laughter. He turned towards her and said, \"My little attendant girl, are you jealous?\"\"Who, who'd be jealous!\" A red blush rose up on Liu Yu Tong's beautiful face, making her even more beautiful, \"Don't delude yourself!\"\"Hey, is that any way to speak to your master?\" Ling Han laughed. Teasing this little attendant girl of his was really quite interesting sometimes.Liu Yu Tong rolled her eyes, but very quickly changed the topic, and said, \"Do you plan to continue to stay in Gray Cloud Town?\" This place really was too small to fit the dragon that Ling Han was.Ling Han laughed and said, \"I'll go take a look at Hu Yang Academy after a while, Father hopes that I can go there to step on the faces of the so-called geniuses there.\"Liu Yu Tong was struck speechless, before saying, \"You can't defeat even me now, and you actually want to go to step all over all the geniuses of Hu Yang Academy? You should be aware that I am not the strongest fighter in Hu Yang Academy.\"\"You'll see when we get there,\" Ling Han no longer spoke any grand words. Only he himself was aware of the great, terrifying potential that he possessed.When the sun had set, the two returned to the Ling Clan Residence.\"You little brat-\" Just as they were entering the Main Hall, they saw Ling Dong Xing striding towards them, his expression extremely grim.At first, Ling Han thought that his skipping class today was discovered by his father. Just when he was about to say something, Ling Dong Xing had already rushed to him and embraced him tightly before laughing heartily and saying, \"You thrashed the two brats from the Cheng Clan, yet you didn't immediately return to inform your old man and let me be happy too?\"Ling Han released the breath he was holding before he said, \"Then, Father, how did you find out?\"\"This is no small matter, how could I not find out about it after such a long while?\" Ling Dong Xing stopped his hearty laughter, regained his serious expression and said, \"Han'er, you really show much promise, the fourth layer of Body Refining Tier actually defeated the ninth layer of Body Refining Tier! However, this is much too shocking, I'm worried that some people would spare no expense just to eliminate you.\"Ling Han nodded. Most people's attitudes towards geniuses would be filled with admiration and respect, but he no longer belonged to the level of geniuses. Rather, he was more like a freak, to an inconceivable extent at that.\"I've released information saying that you're actually in the seventh layer of Body Refining Tier. You had just deliberately kept a low profile in the past,\" Ling Dong Xing continued.This kind of explanation was actually full of gaps. After all, keeping a low profile and being trash were two different matters. But when compared with the event when a person only in the fourth layer of Body Refining Tier defeated the ninth layer of the Body Refining Tier... wouldn't this explanation be easier to accept for the public?Moreover, the strength Ling Han displayed in the last stages of the fight was the seventh layer of the Body Refining Tier, so this kind of explanation would be easier to believe.\"You don't have to go to the academy tomorrow to avoid others from seeing any discrepancies,\" Ling Dong Xing said. Anyone of the Element Gathering Tier would be able to tell with one look what Ling Han's actual cultivation level was. If that happened, the lie would immediately be exposed.This was exactly what Ling Han wanted. However, the problem now was that he could not only not go the academy, he couldn't even leave the clan residence. Because he had played too much today, there would definitely be a lot of interested parties in Gray Cloud Town. There may even be some who would watch out for his appearance from nearby the Ling Clan Residence.There was only one solution, and that was to have his actual cultivation level really reach the seventh layer of Body Refining Tier. In this way, the lie would become the truth.Since he couldn't leave the residence anyways, Ling Han decided to place his full focus on cultivating. Ling Dong Xing was in full support of this, and under Ling Han's request, he provided him with a large amount of monetary funds. Meanwhile, Ling Han had Liu Yu Tong go purchase medicinal ingredients as he would be personally concocting an alchemical pill.The alchemical pill that Ling Han wanted to concoct was named the \"Little Cloud and Water Pill\". Taking this pill would greatly increase the cultivation speed of a martial artist in Body Refining Tier. While this pill could be bought, the medicinal effects were too poor. Ling Han had taken one, and it was at most only half as good as the one he concocted.You can do a lot of things if you have enough money. Liu Yu Tong very quickly returned with the medicinal ingredients Ling Han had requested, also bringing with her an alchemy furnace.\"It's a bit challenging for a martial artist at fourth layer of Body Refining Tier to concoct pills,\" Ling Han murmured. Ordinarily, one could only start concocting pills once they reached the seventh layer of Body Refining Tier, at least. Otherwise, if there was not enough origin power to support the concocting process, one would not be able to continue concocting when they reach the advanced stage of the process. Thus, the result would naturally be failure.'Looks like I have to simultaneously take Return Origin Pills and concoct the pill.'He skilfully separated the various ingredients, his hands moving at such an extremely fast pace that Liu Yu Tong, who had been standing at the side, felt that her eyes were blurring. Now, she finally believed that Ling Han knew how to concoct pills and was not just knowledgeable in the theory of alchemy.Was there anything this guy didn't know?Ling Han threw several medicinal ingredients into the furnace. However, he did not dump everything inside. He had only threw about one third of the ingredients on hand, then his right hand jolted, he gave a snort, and suddenly a flame appeared on his extended palm.Ignition\u2014this was the basic ability every alchemist should have. It was also why every alchemist needed to have a Fire Alignment Spirit Base.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 21": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Alchemy Emperor of the Divine DaoCH 21Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe reason why concocting pills was a difficult task was because it was difficult to control the temperature level.Should one use firewood to start the fire, it would be very difficult to control the heat level of the flames, let alone achieve the precision required to concoct pills. In theory, the higher the grade of alchemical pill, the stricter the requirements for controlling the fire.Precision aside, the alchemist also had to be able to stimulate the heat to an extreme level; the alchemist's cultivation had to be very high to achieve this. Ordinarily speaking, an alchemist should be able to concoct pills that are at most one level higher than his own cultivation level.For example, for Ling Han who was in Body Refining Tier, his limit should be concocting middle level Yellow Grade pills.However, the primary requirement was the ability to control fire. There were also certain requirements for the heat level, which was why too low a cultivation level would make concocting pills impossible, the minimum being the seventh layer of Body Refining Tier. Ling Han was only in the fourth layer of Body Refining Tier, and yet he dared to concoct a pill... the reason why he dared to do that lay in his Spirit Base.As he possessed the Five Elements Mix Chaos Lotus, the Origin Power within his body could be transformed to Gold, Wood, Water, Fire or Earth Alignment. The heat level he could control was not really very high, the maximum level being four hundred degrees, but it was enough to concoct the Little Cloud and Water Pill. [ED/N: Most likely Celsius]'It's worthy of the name \"Five Elements Mix Chaos Lotus\"--the five elements are in a mutually dependent relationship with one another, and seemingly inexhaustible!' Ling Han praised silently. An ordinary Fire Alignment Spirit Base in the Body Refining Tier would only be able to release flames that could reach the maximum temperature of two hundred degrees. Even he who had had a pure Fire Alignment Spirit Base in his last life was no different.The Five Elements Mix Chaos Lotus could transform into any of the five elemental alignments, which was something that the Nine Yang Fire Spirit Base could never compare with.It was indeed worthy of the name of Immortal Grade Spirit Base!Ling Han's left hand continued to spin, heating every nook and cranny of the furnace. The heat required for various parts of the furnace was different--in future, to concoct high grade alchemical pills would require a furnace with high specifications, such as the level of heat penetration and the level of heat endurance, to name a few of them. A good furnace was something over which any self-respecting alchemist would go to war!Occasionally, he would throw in one of the medicinal ingredients into the furnace. Sometimes, he would open the lid of the furnace, while at others, he would keep it closed. His practiced movements were carried out at such a fast speed that they would just be a blur in any observer's eyes.Liu Yu Tong, who had been standing at the side, was already speechless, her eyes wide.Thank goodness she wasn't an alchemist and so did not really have much of an understanding of this profession. Otherwise, if she had known that the lowest requirement for an alchemist's cultivation level was the seventh layer of Body Refining Tier, then she would definitely be even more shocked.Then again, she was already shocked enough by now. A few more times and she might pass out due to extreme shock.The higher the temperature of the flames, the more Origin Power the alchemist had to use. Very quickly, Ling Han felt that he was nearing exhaustion, so he quickly tossed a Return Origin Pill into his mouth, chewed it up and immediately felt Origin Power enter his body bit by bit, allowing him to continue the process.Time passed slowly, and Ling Han continuously took Return Origin Pills. After two hours, Ling Han suddenly gave a loud shout and bit his tongue, fresh blood spilling. Under the power of the Lone Wolf's Blood, his origin power suddenly rose up to another level, causing the heat level of the flames to rise up to about six hundred degrees.\"Pill completed!\" He suddenly retracted the flames. The final surge of the flames was the finishing touch that increased the effects of the alchemical pill by about five percent.Unfortunately, the four hundred degree temperature was his limit. He could only injure himself to stimulate the Lone Wolf's Blood if he wanted to release a heat of six hundred degrees.He lifted the lid of the furnace and a faint medicinal fragrance instantly wafted out.Liu Yu Tong could not help coming closer to peek into the furnace. There were exactly seventeen round vermilion-colored pills inside. The surface of the pills sparkled temptingly, appearing almost translucent. Although she herself did not know anything about alchemy, she was certain that Ling Han had succeeded in concocting the pills.\"You really are a freak!\" She said, a strange expression in her eyes.Ling Han laughed loudly, and said, \"You'll get used to it soon.\"Liu Yu Tong wasn't sure whether she would become crazy or grow numb under the continuous assault of these miracles.Ling Han took a Little Cloud and Water Pill, swallowed it in one mouthful and immediately began cultivation.\"Hong!\" The Little Cloud and Water Pill was like calcium oxide, whereas the environmental Qi was like water. The encounter between the two immediately gave rise to a powerful reaction, leading to the assault of a terrifying amount of Spiritual Qi. The Five Elements Mix Chaos Lotus within Ling Han's Dantian stirred lightly, accepting the incoming Qi and absorbing it at a frightening speed.'Only an Immortal Grade Spirit Base would be able to withstand such intensity,' Ling Han thought while circulating Five Elements Heaven Grade Skill to transform the incoming Spiritual Qi into his own Origin Power, filling his limbs and veins with it.An hour later, the medicinal effects of the first Little Cloud and Water Pill were used up. Ling Han swallowed a second pill and continued cultivating.However, by the time the medicinal effects of the third Little Cloud and Water Pill were used up as well, Ling Han's tolerance level had also reached its limits. He felt extremely tired, and the upper half of his body immediately toppled over as he fell asleep on the floor right where he was.Liu Yu Tong, who had been beside him all the while, could not help shaking her head. She then helped Ling Han onto the bed and attentively took off his shoes and covered him with the quilt. She then exited the inner chamber and fell asleep on a chair in the outer chamber.She was a very responsible follower whose main duty was to protect Ling Han.The night passed. When Ling Han opened his eyes, the first thing he saw was the canopy of his bed, which caused him to be slightly surprised because he had no recollection of climbing onto the bed last night.But this was not important.He smiled, because his cultivation level had once again risen to a new level as he broke through to the fifth layer of Body Refining Tier.The reason why he could break through two layers yesterday was because the past cultivation rate of this body was too slow. The first time the Five Elements Mix Chaos Lotus was active at full power naturally led to a one-time eruption. Of course, this would not happen again in future.\"You, you've broken through again!\" When Ling Han stepped out of the internal chamber, Liu Yu Tong immediately looked as if she had seen a ghost. She was even stumbling over her words, her eyes fixed in a stare directed at Ling Han.\"This is only the Body Refining Tier, this speed is normal,\" Ling Han said, completely calm.'Hell, it's normal!'Liu Yu Tong was about to go crazy. In any case, as someone who had a Heaven Grade Spirit Base, she spent ten days to break through to the second layer of Body Refining Tier once she stepped onto the path of a cultivator. As for breaking through from the fourth layer to the fifth layer of Body Refining Tier, it took her twenty five days.How could twenty five days' time compare to a single night?\"You're not going to break through to the sixth layer of Body Refining Tier tomorrow, are you?\" Liu Yu Tong asked suddenly.Ling Han thought for a moment, before he shook his head and said, \"No.\"Hearing this, Liu Yu Tong finally released the breath she was holding. If Ling Han said \"yes\", she really might have gone crazy.\"I should be able to the day after tomorrow,\" Ling Han continued after a slight pause.Monster! He had to be a monster!Liu Yu Tong stared at him resentfully, determined that she would never try to guess this guy's cultivation speed again. Anyways, she decided she would just pretend that he's a monster, so that no matter what speed he cultivated with, she would not think it strange in any way.Ling Han laughed. After having breakfast, he once again began cultivating behind closed doors.However, there were limits to one's vitality. He could not possibly cultivate without end. Thus, even if he had started cultivation during daytime, in truth, it did not really increase his cultivation speed by much. However, he was now fighting against time, so it'd be good even if there was only a minuscule increase in his cultivation speed.Meanwhile, Liu Yu Tong's progress was also extremely rapid. With the aid of a Heaven Grade cultivation skill, she would be able to reach the peak period of the ninth layer of Element Gathering Tier within two months at most, and even she herself was in a state of disbelief over this kind of cultivation speed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In the whole history of Rain Country, there were very, very few that could compare with her. But now, she had a very high chance of breaching this gap at the age of eighteen!Even though it was only the difference of two years, just how old was she? It would be shocking enough for a cultivator of her age to speed up his or her breakthrough by a few months, but she had sped up her breakthrough by two whole years!This was all because of Ling Han.However, when you compare this kind of progression rate with Ling Han's own, then it really was nothing worth mentioning.From the second layer to the fourth layer of Body Refining Tier, he spent one night. From the fourth layer to the fifth layer of Body Refining Tier, one night. From the fifth layer to the sixth layer of Body Refining Tier, two nights.When others talk about cultivating, they'd be talking about months or even years spent cultivating. But for Ling Han, his cultivation rate was counted in days--he was such a freak.Ling Han only laughed and said, \"This cultivation speed can't really be considered fast. There are some demonic beasts that are already Element Gathering Tier at birth, some are even Gushing Spring Tier. These creatures are an existence that have been blessed by the heavens.\"\"Are there really such demonic beasts?\" Liu Yu Tong's beautiful eyes widened. There were actually demonic beasts that were even stronger at birth than she was now?\"Of course!\" Ling Han nodded. He paused, then continued, \"I have seen historical records depicting that some demonic beasts, which are already extinct, were even at Heaven Tier at birth. They were born invincible.\"Liu Yu Tong did not believe him. She asked, \"Since they were already in Heaven Tier at birth, then why would they become extinct?\"\"The world has its own rules. Who would be able to fight against time?\" Ling Han shook his head. In his last life, it was because he did not want to just die and rot that he had resolutely stepped onto a dangerous path, seeking a way to break through to Shattering Void Tier. \"There are too many mysteries on this land that can easily erase even those in Heaven Tier.\"In his previous life, when he had been a powerful existence of Heaven Tier, there were many places that he dared not venture to, fearing that he could fall from the sky at every turn there.***After two days of hard cultivation, Ling Han exerted more effort to complete accumulating in the fifth layer of Body Refining Tier. He then easily reached the sixth layer of Body Refining Tier.Because he had already walked this familiar path in his last life, the comprehension of his cultivation was a problem that he needed not think about.\"However, from the sixth layer to the seventh layer of Body Refining Tier, this is a tiny, little leap. Three days won't be enough, I'd need four days, or maybe even five days' time,\" Ling Han gave a sigh. He'd just have to continue working hard at cultivation for another four or five days.Beside him, Liu Yu Tong, who had been listening to Ling Han's resentful complaints, experienced a sudden impulse to go crazy.'This freak!'One day later, Ling Han had reached the early period of the sixth layer of Body Refining Tier. On the second day, he had already reached the middle period. On the third day, he was in the late period. On the fourth day, he had achieved the peak of the sixth layer of Body Refining Tier.He did not drag it into the fifth day. Ling Han began to break through and, less than an hour later, he had stepped into the seventh layer of Body Refining Tier.A sixteen-year-old with the cultivation of seventh layer of Body Refining Tier... in Rain Country, such a cultivator would be considered \"acceptable\". Moreover, if anyone was told that Ling Han had been in the second layer of Body Refining Tier and spent eight days to break through to the seventh layer of Body Refining Tier, they would definitely not believe it.Thus, even Liu Yu Tong, who had observed the whole process, was absent-minded, her expression distant. When she walked, her movements made it look like she was floating on air.She had truly been shocked.\"I can finally go out,\" Ling Han stretched. Now that he had a youthful body, his mentality too became youthful. After being confined to his chamber for seven days, he felt as if he was a fierce tiger that had been imprisoned.\"Let's go see Father, the Cheng Clan should have acted by now,\" he murmured.It was quite coincidental. Although Ling Dong Xing had been so busy that he was nowhere to be found these few days, today he happened to be sitting in his study. However, his mood appeared to be very bad, his brows wrinkled in a deep frown.\"Father, I guess the Cheng Clan has made their move?\" Ling Han asked directly.Ling Dong Xing did not raise his head to look at him. He only gave a nod, continuing to write something on a piece of paper.\"Is the situation very bad?\" Ling Han asked.Ling Dong Xing heaved a sigh before finally putting his pen down and saying, \"It's very bad! Though our Ling Clan has numerous properties, there are only two that are most profitable to the clan. One is the mine, the other is the medicine shop.\"Ling Han knew that the Ling Clan owned a copper mine. The ownership of this mine fell into the hands of the Ling Clan only thirty years ago--the Ling Clan had paid an extremely heavy price to obtain this mine as many powerful warriors of the clan had died in the process.As for the medicine shop, it would purchase lower grade medicinal pills from Heaven's Medicine Pavilion and resell them to customers at a price a little higher than the original price. Although this was only a simple purchase-and-resale trade, because there was an enormous market for medicinal pills, this was a major source of income for the clan. The actual profit from selling each pill might have been small, but the number of transactions more than made up for itThe weakness of the medicine shop was that it completely relied on the Heaven's Medicine Pavilion. However, because the Heaven's Medicine Pavilion wanted to maintain a mutually beneficial relationship with the locally influential parties, the two Great Clans of the town could each obtain some pills to sell.\"Five days ago, our mine had been attacked by an unknown party, leading to quite a few casualties. Now everyone is in a state of anxiety. Even though we increased wages, there are not many who are willing to enter the mine.\"Ling Dong Xing continued to say, \"Furthermore, Alchemist Ma from the Heaven's Medicine Pavilion had suddenly started making things difficult for us. He said that the batch of medicinal pills sent from Headquarters this time has been delayed on the road for some reason and the delivery will be late. Now, our stock of pills in the warehouse is close to being completely sold out. If the situation continues and we still aren't able to restock, then the medicine shop can only be temporarily closed.\"Once the medicine shop closed its doors, the shop's reputation would definitely be affected. Even if it once again opened its doors to do business in the future, some customers would definitely be lost.\"These two days, our finances are already a bit tight. We must figure out something as quick as possible,\" Ling Dong Xing sighed.Although the Ling Clan was a large existence with various properties, their expenses were also very large. There was a saying, the poor practice cultural arts while the rich practice martial arts. Cultivation was an extremely expensive endeavor. And now, the two key businesses of the Ling Clan were hit at the same time, thus the clan funds immediately became tight. If things went on like this, there would be big trouble. In fact, they may even be forced to sell off some of their less important businesses.\"It's done by the Cheng Clan!\" Ling Han said immediately, very certain.Ling Dong Xing nodded. Their two greatest businesses encountered difficulties at the same time, there could never be such a huge coincidence in this world. He tapped his finger once on the table, and said, \"There's also a traitor.\"Ling Han's eyes became cold, and he said, \"Ling Zhong Kuan?\"\"That's right!\" He did not plan to conceal anything from his own son. He scoffed, \"Once something happened to the mine, I immediately increased the numbers of the patrolling party, yet they didn't even spot the enemy. Unless someone had leaked the patrolling routes beforehand, how could this be possible?\"It was likely that once Ling Zhong Kuan heard that Cheng Xiang and his brother had both been thrashed, he had secretly met with Cheng Wen Kun and reached some kind agreement with the latter--most likely it was to have Cheng Clan aid him in snatching the position of Clan Head. Though only he himself knew what kind of humiliating terms he'd agreed to in exchange for their assistance.\"I've made a lunch appointment with Alchemist Ma of the Heaven's Medicine Pavilion. I 'd definitely have to give him some benefits. Otherwise, the clan would really be in a big trouble,\" Ling Dong Xing continued to say.Alchemist Ma.... Ma Da Jun?Ling Han could not help the strange expression on his face, as he said, \"I'll accompany you, Father.\"\"Your duty now is to concentrate on cultivation, unless you reach the seventh layer of Body- pu!\" Ling Dong Xing finally raised his head to look directly at Ling Han. This one look caused him to choke, his expression slack.Had Liu Yu Tong seen his reaction, she would definitely feel very comforted. She couldn't very well be the only person to be shocked by Ling Han's cultivation speed, right?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If someone had told him in the past that one day he would be shocked speechless by someone in the seventh layer of Body Refining Tier, he'd definitely give the speaker a good, solid slap. But now, it was himself he wanted to give a good, solid slap--to make sure that the sight before him was real and he wasn't merely dreaming!\"Yes, so you do not have to worry anymore, Father,\" Ling Han smiled.Ling Dong Xing's face twitched, but after a while, he could not stop himself from laughing long and loud. It was as if all the worries that had troubled his mind these few days had evaporated. His son had shown such promise--what else did he need to worry about?\"Good son, good son!\" He was unbearably excited. He finally believed that his son truly had the ability to help him rescue his wife!\"Then, tonight we'll head to the dinner together,\" Ling Dong Xing said with a nod. Now that his son was showing more and more promise, the position of Clan Head definitely would be passed down to his son in future, thus it'd be good to have Ling Han follow by his side and learn through observation.Ling Han kept up the smile on his face. When he imagined Alchemist Ma seeing him later tonight, he could practically see the thunderstruck expression on the latter's face.***That night, Ling Dong Xing and his son, accompanied by four attendants, arrived at \"Xuan Yu House\". This was where Ling Dong Xing had invited Alchemist Ma for dinner.While they were waiting in one of the private rooms of the restaurant, Ling Dong Xing and Ling Han talked with each other.\"Peng!\" The door was suddenly pushed open, and two people entered.They were Ling Zhong Kuan and Ling Mu Yun!\"What are the two of you doing here?\" Ling Dong Xing said coldly.\"The clan is in such big trouble, how could I not come?\" Ling Zhong Kuan did not wait to be invited before sitting down and saying to Ling Dong Xing, \"I'd advise you to step back from this issue, and leave this matter for me to handle.\"\"You?\" Ling Dong Xing laughed coldly, and said, \"Why?\"\"You must have offended Alchemist Ma in some way. Otherwise, how could it be that he would make trouble for our clan for no reason?\" Ling Zhong Kuan spoke slowly, then gesturing at Ling Mu Yun, said, \"This boy went to be examined yesterday. He has a great potential for fire control. Thus, hehe, he has already been accepted by Alchemist Ma as an apprentice. After a few years' hard work, Alchemist Ma would take him in as an official disciple. In the future, he would become an alchemist.\"Ling Mu Yun walked up to stand proudly beside Ling Zhong Kuan. There was immeasurable pride on his face.After the \"trouble\" caused by Ling Han, he had lost the chance to enroll into Hu Yang Academy. But who would have thought that when a door closed, a window would open. He actually had a great potential for fire control, so there was a high chance that he would become an alchemist in future.Alchemist--the most powerful, most noble profession in the whole of Gray Cloud Town... no, the whole of Rain Country!Ling Zhong Kuan was very proud. His two sons weren't even able to compare with Ling Dong Xing, but that was all right, for his grandson was much, much more outstanding than Ling Han!\"Pu!\"He looked closely at Ling Han for a moment before suddenly gasping in shock.This, this, this, this, this, this, what was this? The seventh layer of Body Refining Tier? No, no, no, no, no, no, he must have seen wrongly, how could Ling Han be in the seventh layer of Body Refining Tier!Ling Zhong Kuan could not help rubbing his eyes a few times and taking another close look at Ling Han. However, the powerful air around Ling Han was still the same.Seventh layer of Body Refining Tier through and through.Did this brat take some kind of godly medicine?Ling Zhong Kuan could not control the violent twitching of his wrinkled face. He had truly experienced a tremendous shock.\"Grandfather, are you all right?\" Ling Mu Yun felt that his grandfather was behaving very oddly. Weren't they supposed to strut around now, rubbing the fact that he was going to become an alchemist in the faces of Ling Dong Xing and his son? Why was his grandfather suddenly acting so silly?\"Seventh, seventh layer of Body Refining Tier!\" Ling Zhong Kuan stuttered out.That's right, Ling Mu Yun was in the seventh layer of Body Refining Tier. What was so strange about that, didn't he already know that? Ling Mu Yun looked strangely at Ling Zhong Kuan. Why was his grandfather suddenly behaving so abnormally?\"Not you, him!\" Ling Zhong Kuan said, pointing at Ling Han.\"Pu!\"Ling Mu Yun gasped in shock. Seventh layer of Body Refining Tier? What kind of joke was this? In the clan, every member knew Ling Han's infamous reputation as a piece of trash. He had cultivated for many years, and yet had only managed to reach the second layer of Body Refining Tier. Otherwise, why else would he be labeled as trash in the clan?If Ling Han, who was now in the seventh layer of Body Refining Tier, was considered a piece of trash, then what about him, who had only reached the seventh layer of Body Refining Tier at eighteen? Was he the ultimate piece of trash?\"Impossible, this is definitely impossible!\" He muttered in complete disbelief.But he knew very well that his grandfather was in the ninth layer of Element Gathering Tier, so there was no way he could be mistaken.\"Haha, what do you think of my son now? Not bad, right?\" Ling Dong Xing laughed heartily. \"This kind of natural talent should be good enough to enroll in the Hu Yang Academy, right?\"Hearing these words, Ling Zhong Kuan and his grandson's expressions became even uglier.They took advantage of the fact that Ling Dong Xing was away to force Ling Han to give up the chance to enroll into Hu Yang Academy, and the result was running into a stone wall. Ling Dong Xing was deliberately mentioning the Hu Yang Academy to taunt them with it.Ling Mu Yun was still very young, thus he couldn't remain composed and said, \"What's the big deal about Hu Yang Academy? I have entered the world of alchemists now, and I will become the most respected man in Rain Country in the future!\"\"Is that so?\" Ling Han shook his head, and said, \"I can guarantee that you will never become an alchemist's apprentice, so of course, you will never become an alchemist either.\"\"Hahahaha, who do you think you are? Do you actually think you can influence Alchemist Ma's decision?\" Ling Mu Yun laughed coldly. He felt this was the biggest joke in the world--if Ling Han really had such ability, then why would Alchemist Ma purposely cause trouble and delay the distribution of alchemical pills for the clan?Ling Han did not say anything else. He only smiled--after all, things would become clear later.However, even Ling Dong Xing himself did not take Ling Han's threat seriously. In his opinion, although his son had truly displayed a great natural talent in the field of martial arts, he couldn't possibly have any relations with Alchemist Ma.Although the four of them all belonged to the Ling Clan, they were mutually antagonistic, so how could they possibly have any common topics to converse with each other? After the short verbal battle, they each kept silent, waiting for the arrival of Alchemist Ma.However, this Alchemist Ma really liked to put on airs. After a long time, he still had not appeared. When they were nearing the limits of their patience, they finally heard footsteps from outside the door.\"Zhi...\" the door opened, and a medium-sized man entered. This man could only be Alchemist Ma.There was only one alchemist in the whole of Gray Cloud Town, even more so only one surnamed Ma.Ling Dong Xing, Ling Zhong Kuan and Ling Mu Yun all stood up, grasping their fists in greeting. Ling Mu Yun even bent and knelt in front of the newcomer and said respectfully, \"Disciple Mu Yun hereby greets Master!\"An alchemist's apprentice could barely be counted as half an alchemist's disciple.\"You may rise,\" Ma Da Jun casually waved his hands, and nodded at Ling Dong Xing, saying, \"You don't have to waste your time on pleasantries. Let's just get down to business. I'm a very busy man.\"\"Ling Han, how dare you not greet Alchemist Ma?\" Ling Mu Yun immediately pointed at Ling Han. He had very sharp eyes and had immediately noticed that Ling Han had not greeted Alchemist Ma. He was even just sitting there as if nothing important was going on.Ling Dong Xing was very surprised. The reason he had invited Alchemist Ma to dinner tonight was to curry favor with the man and solve the medicine supply problem. But now Ling Mu Yun had taken advantage of and directly pointed out this weakness; were things going to turn bad?He could not help getting angry in secret. The important thing was to settle the problem that the Ling Clan was facing now, how could Ling Mu Yun be so petty? He suddenly felt that he really wanted to kill this little brat in one blow.\"Hey, he really doesn't know the rules of the game!\" Ling Zhong Kuan too harrumphed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 24": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Alchemy Emperor of the Divine DaoCH 24Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLing Mu Yun had very fortunately taken hold of Ling Han's weakness so he naturally would not easily give it up. He continued aggressively, \"Alchemist is the most respected, most dignified profession in the whole of Rain Country, yet you not only did not stand up to greet my master upon his arrival, but also continue to remain seated? How arrogant can you be?Kneel down quickly and beg my Master for a punishment!\"Ling Dong Xing frowned slightly. Alchemists were indeed very rare and held a high status in Rain Country. For example, even though this Ma Da Jun was only in the ninth layer of Body Refining Tier, as he was a Yellow Grade medium level alchemist, even strong warriors of the Element Gathering Tier like himself and Ling Zhong Kuan had to show him some face and satisfy Ma Da Jun's ego.Now that Ling Zhong Kuan and his grandson had taken advantage of this point to attack Ling Han, he really might encounter some trouble.Clasping his fists, Ling Dong Xing said, \"Alchemist Ma, many apologies. If my son has done anything to offend you, I hereby apologize on his behalf. As a forgiving, generous man, please do not lower yourself to the same level as my son.\"Ma Da Jun hadn't even noticed Ling Han. He only found out what was going on after hearing Ling Mu Yun's reprimand, so he couldn't control his rising dissatisfaction and said, \"Ling Clan Head, you're really quite incredible. You invited me to dinner, so I offered you due respect by coming here. Yet you actually allow your son to humiliate me? Snort, what kind of logic is this?\"\"Ling Han, kneel down now!\" Ling Mu Yun smiled coldly. He knew very well that alchemical pills were one of the most important source of income for the clan, thus even if Ling Dong Xing did not want to, he had no choice but to concede on this issue and pressure Ling Han to do as told.'Forced to kneel by his own old man, Ling Han would definitely be very depressed and unbearably sorrowful, wouldn't he? Hahahahaha!''\"Alchemist Ma-\" Ling Dong Xing tried again to advise Ma Da Jun to let things go.Ma Da Jun only raised his hand to stop Ling Dong Xing from continuing to speak. He did not even look at Ling Han and only said casually, \"Let your son kneel down in front of me to explain.\"\"Peng!\"Ling Dong Xing slammed his hand heavily down on the table and said, \"Alchemist Ma, I do not know what benefits you have received from the Cheng Clan to help them make trouble for our Ling Clan. But don't you dare go to far. You actually want my, Ling Dong Xing's son, to kneel down? Get lost!\"\"How dare you!\" Ling Zhong Kuan immediately shouted loudly, \"Ling Dong Xing, what are you trying to do? Are you trying to bring ruin to the clan? The clan does not just belong to you alone! As someone who does not care about the big picture, what right do you have to continue to hold onto the position of Clan Head of the Ling Clan?\"Ling Dong Xing's gaze turned heavy, and he said, \"Who of those here is the one who does not care about the big picture? Because I considered the fact that we share the same surname of Ling, there were some things that I did not bring out into the open, yet you all bully my son in this manner. Do you really think I, Ling Dong Xing, am already dead?\"\"Enough, if you're going to engage in a family squabble, then have your argument at home. I'm a very busy man,\" Ma Da Jun interrupted. \"Quickly make this brat kneel down in front of me in apology.\"\"Ma Da Jun, who are you asking to kneel?\" Ling Han finally opened his mouth as he asked calmly.Ma Da Jun?At first, Ling Zhong and Ling Mu Yun were both shocked, thinking secretly that Ling Han was really gutsy to actually call Alchemist Ma directly by his name. Yet immediately, they looked extremely pleased--Ling Han had completely offended Ma Da Jun now! Ling Dong Xing and his son were definitely finished!'Haha, I knew that this brat would bring ruin to his father.'\"You trash, to actually call my master by his name directly, how dare you!\" Ling Mu Yun immediately shouted. He definitely had to take advantage of such a grand opportunity to flatter Ma Da Jun.However, he had not seen that Ma Da Jun's expression quickly turned ugly. He had even stood up from his seat immediately.This voice--how could Ma Da Jun ever forget this voice?\"Kneel down-\"\"Pa!\"Ling Mu Yun did not even manage to finish his words before seeing Ma Da Jun fly towards him like an arrow shot from a bow, raising his hand and giving him a heavy slap.Ling Mu Yun was slapped utterly stupid. Even Ling Dong Xing and Ling Zhong Kuan had vacant expressions, staring blankly. If Ma Da Jun wanted to hit someone, then shouldn't he be slapping Ling Han? Why had he suddenly slap Ling Mu Yun instead?There must be some kind of mistake!\"Ma, Master!\" Ling Mu Yun's expression practically screamed that he felt wronged. Why was he suddenly hit?Under the three observers' uncomprehending stares, Ma Da Jun quickly raced to stand in front of Ling Han. Bowing, he lowered his head respectfully as if he was an obedient little lackey and said, \"So the noble guest today was Young Master Han. Please forgive my blindness for not managing to notice Young Master Han just now.\"Although he had suffered a great deal because of Ling Han, he had had no idea what his name was--Zhu He Xin naturally had no need to explain anything to him.What? What?The other three members of the Ling Clan all entered into \"petrified\" mode. Was this really the extremely arrogant, high and mighty Alchemist Ma from just moments ago? Why did they suddenly feel like he had become a pug dog? Furthermore, why did he address Ling Han 'Young Master Han'?Although Ma Da Jun's actual cultivation level could not be considered very high, he was an alchemist.And an alchemist always commanded great respect and dignity!The other three felt as if they had been petrified. They could not believe what they were seeing and hearing at all.\"This is your disciple? How overbearing!\" Ling Han said, looking at Ling Han. His tone was extremely serene.However, Ma Da Jun was shocked half to death. Once more, he gave another solid slap to Ling Mu Yun, and said, \"Who do you think you are, to actually be so impolite to Young Master Han? I have no such disciple. From now onwards, do not address me as your master.\"Ling Mu Yun immediately put on an expression of disbelief. He had been chased out? Just because of one word from Ling Han?He recalled that Ling Han had just told him that he would never become an alchemist. Those words actually came true!\"No, Master, please do not chase me away, please give me another chance!\" Ling Mu Yun pleaded earnestly, quickly throwing himself to Ma Da Jun's feet.He was not a martial arts genius, and had even lost the chance to enroll at Hu Yang Academy. Thus, becoming an alchemist was his last chance. Otherwise, he would have to be just like his father and grandfather. The strongest he could become would only be Element Gathering Tier, and he'd have a certain status only in the very small, very remote Gray Cloud Town.\"Get lost, you dared to be impolite to Young Master Han! I was already being merciful by not killing you, and you actually fancy that you are going to be an alchemist?\" Ma Da Jun snorted. Even Zhu He Xin, Grandmaster Zhu, was extremely respectful facing Ling Han. If he knew that Ling Mu Yun actually dared to take such an attitude towards Ling Han, he may even rush over here to kill this brat with his own hands!And with one word from Grandmaster Zhu, which alchemist in the whole of Rain Country would dare to take Ling Mu Yun as a disciple?Ling Mu Yun could not control the ashen expression on his face. He was dazed, looking as if he had lost his soul.\"Let's go!\" Ling Zhong Kuan took hold of his grandson. He knew there was no use saying anything now--it was better for them to leave before they embarrass themselves further.\"No! I'm an alchemist's apprentice, I will become an alchemist in the future!\" Ling Mu Yun struggled with all his might, as if he had gone mad. But Ling Zhong Kuan held him tightly. Those still remaining in the private room could only hear the screams getting farther and farther away before they finally disappeared.In the private room, Ling Dong Xing looked dumbstruck, while Ma Da Jun was drenched in cold sweat. He did not know if he had managed to soothe Ling Han's anger. He really dared not offend this young master.\"Just now, you were quite fierce facing my father,\" Ling Han said calmly, yet there was a strong dissatisfaction in his voice.\"Young Master Han, I had no idea just now that Ling Clan Head was your father. Otherwise, I would never dare to put on airs in front of Ling Clan Head!\" He spoke with a pained expression, \"I deserve death, I really am worthless!\"He strengthened his resolve, and actually started to slap himself repeatedly!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But to actually be someone whom an alchemist would fawn on and painstakingly curry favor with... this still caused him to be incomparably shocked!Before, Ma Da Jun's attitude was one full of arrogance, superiority and condescending. He had invited Ma Da Jun repeatedly before the man finally agreed to come, and yet the first thing the latter did upon coming was to seek flaws and create problems. He had truly displayed the arrogance of an alchemist to the full extent.But now... he really dared not believe that Ma Da Jun would actually treat him with such respect and courtesy.These few days that he was gone... what had actually happened to cause his son to change so much?\"Ling Clan Head, I truly deserve death. Please do not worry, I shall have someone deliver the medicine to you as soon as I return,\" Ma Da Jun said very gently and cautiously. Once he recalled his previous attitude towards Ling Dong Xing, he could not control the rapid beating of his heart. He was scared half to death now.Ling Han tapped one finger on the table, and said, \"Is it the Cheng Clan that had you do such a thing?\"\"Hehe, Young Master Han, I really didn't know that Ling Clan Head was your father, and so fell under the deception of the Cheng Clan. You must believe me!\" Ma Da Jun explained hurriedly.Ling Han smiled and said, \"I believe you.\"Ma Da Jun immediately felt elated, but then he heard Ling Han continue to speak, \"You're a greedy man. Going by your personality and character, how could you actually deign to help the Cheng Clan without sufficient benefits? Tell me then, what benefits have you received from the Cheng Clan?\"\"This-\" Ma Da Jun stuttered, but once he saw Ling Han's sharp gaze, he tensed up and hurriedly said, \"Thirty thousand silver coins.\"\"The Cheng Clan is really generous!\" Ling Dong Xing snorted. As the head of clan, he had a deep understanding of the significance of thirty thousand silver coins.The Cheng Clan and the Ling Clan were very similar in that they both had shockingly large income yet their spending was also extremely large. A sum of thirty thousand silver coins could only be painstakingly saved up over two, three years' time. That the Cheng Clan was willing to use such an astronomical sum to hire Ma Da Jun meant they were completely serious in their attempt to utterly cut off the Ling Clan's lifeblood.Just as Ling Han said, Ma Da Jun was a greedy man. To let him once again supply Ling Clan with medicine, they would have to offer him a reward that exceeded thirty thousand silver coins. But the problem was that after the Ling Clan had been hit twice, they had practically expended all money they had available, so where would they be able to find thirty thousand silver coins to bribe Ma Da Jun with?This move may have been only a little wound to the Cheng Clan, but for the Ling Clan, it would definitely be a fatal injury.Thank goodness he had a good son!Ling Dong Xing could not help smiling. The Cheng Clan would never have thought that the thirty thousand silver coins they had handed over was practically wasted.\"Thirty thousand coins, that's quite a lot,\" Ling Han looked at Ma Da Jun with a faint smile, \"Alchemists really are quite expensive. They had to spend such an amount to be able to bribe you.\"\"Young Master Han, you jest,\" Ma Da Jun wiped away the cold sweat beading on his forehead. He was not an idiot, so naturally he could tell that Ling Han was being sarcastic.\"Because of you, our Ling Clan really have suffered a huge loss these few days,\" Ling Han said serenely.Ma Da Jun immediately shivered, but a flash of inspiration passed through his brain and he hurriedly said, \"Although the mastermind is the Cheng Clan, it is undeniable that I too am responsible to some extent. Thus, allow me to hand over these thirty thousand silver coins to the Ling Clan to compensate for the losses the Ling Clan has suffered.\"Ling Dong Xing was astounded. A man as greedy as Ma Da Jun would actually hand over the monetary bribe that he had long received? Just how terrified was he of his son!Ling Han nodded, and said, \"This isn't a problem for you, right?\"\"How could it be?\" Although he felt as if his heart was bleeding, Ma Da Jun was all smiles and said in embarrassment, \"This is something I ought to do, and it is a small token of my feelings.\"\"All right then!\" Ling Han nodded, \"I need you to do something for me.\"\"Young Master Han, say it and it shall be done,\" Ma Da Jun pandered to him.\"From tomorrow onwards, have the portion of pills usually given to the Cheng Clan be supplied to our Ling Clan for resale,\" Ling Han said.When Ling Dong Xing heard this, he immediately felt ecstatic. Alchemical pills were one of the two largest sources of income for the Ling Clan. If they could get double the amount of their supplies, then their profits would also double accordingly. At the same time, the income of the Cheng Clan would be halved.Should this last for a few years, then the overall power of the Cheng Clan would soon fall very far from the power of the Ling Clan, while the Ling Clan... would be able to completely defeat the Cheng Clan and become the most important clan in Gray Cloud Town, and also the only Great Clan in the town!\"Yes, of course,\" Ma Da Jun replied quickly. After all, all he needed to do was to issue the necessary commands--he would suffer no personal loss on his part.\"I don't need to give you some kind of benefits in exchange?\" Ling Han said with a smile.\"Hoho, Young Master Han, you're really such a joker,\" Ma Da Jun said with a dry laugh.\"All right, there's nothing else that I need you for so you can go on and do your job,\" Ling Han nodded, sending Ma Da Jun off.\"Why not have dinner first before leaving?\" Ling Dong Xing said politely. After all, Ma Da Jun was going to do something for them.Ma Da Jun naturally dared not stay. He hurriedly waved his hands and said, \"No need, no need. I should go ahead and get to work,\" he raised his clasped hands towards Ling Han and then towards Ling Dong Xing while stepping backwards at the same time till he left the room.\"Han'er, wouldn't treating him in this manner backfire?\" Ling Dong Xing said. After all, Ma Da Jun was still an alchemist. They didn't give him any kind of monetary benefits and Ling Han was even rude to him.\"Please don't worry, Father. That guy is the type that fears the strong and bullies the weak. Give him an inch and he'll take a mile,\" Ling Han said with a smile.Ling Dong Xing did not ask Ling Han why Ma Da Jun had been so fearful of and respectful towards him. His son was already all grown up, and so he naturally had his own secrets. As a father, the only thing he needed to do was to support him.Moreover, he also had to start preparing for the next step. Now, it was time for their counterattack!***\"Alchemist Ma!\" Seeing Ma Da Jun come out, Ling Zhong Kuan and his grandson emerged from the shadows, waving over at him.The grandfather and grandson duo did not depart after they'd left the restaurant. Instead, they remained in wait here.In front of Ling Han, Ma Da Jun acted like a pug dog. Yet in front of others, he immediately recovered his arrogant demeanor. He snorted, and said, \"Do you have something to discuss with me?\"\"Alchemist Ma, you see, Mu Yun and Ling Han are brothers of the same clan. Shouldn't you be more accommodating and allow Mu Yun to continue to learn alchemical arts with you?\" Ling Zhong Kuan said with a flattering smile.Yet Ma Da Jun only laughed, and said, \"Chief Butler Ling, I cannot decide on this issue. If you want your grandson to become an alchemist in the future, then you must first obtain Young Master Han's approval! Otherwise, it's useless even if you find another alchemist. No one would dare to take your grandson as a disciple!\"'What!?'Ling Zhong Kuan and his grandson both wore an expression of utter disbelief. How could a mere piece of trash have such power?\"You can choose not to believe me, but this has nothing to do with me, so please do not drag me into this affair,\" Ma Da Jun waved his hand, \"However, I will still offer you a word of advice--do not oppose Young Master Han on any account. Furthermore, you have no idea how fortunate you are!\"They were all members of Ling Clan. There was no such thing as eternal enmity among family. As long as they sincerely apologized to Ling Dong Xing and his son, then how could it be that they would not receive any benefits in the future?After all, Ling Han was a man that even Grandmaster Zhu, Zhu He Xin, treated with respect!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 26": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Alchemy Emperor of the Divine DaoCH 26Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayJust as Ma Da Jun had said, this matter had nothing to do with him, so once he said what he wanted to say, he quickly departed. He still had to complete the task that Ling Han had commanded him to do.\"Grandfather, are we really going to do as he had said and obey Ling Dong Xing and his son's commands without questions?\" Ling Mu Yun asked, gritting his teeth. How could he resign himself to do such a thing? Ling Han was a well-known piece of trash, and for him to actually obey the commands of a piece of trash... just the mere thought of him made him feel stupid.\"Of course not!\" Ling Zhong Kuan strongly waved his hand, \"I've worked so hard all these years, how could I allow a piece of trash to ruin all my hard effort? Whether that brat is a real piece of trash or had just been pretending to be one, there is no way that he can stand in the way of me taking over our Ling Clan!\"\"But Grandfather, what is our next move?\" Ling Mu Yun appeared very dazed.\"Wait!\" Ling Zhong Kuan said in a deep voice, \"The relations between Cheng Clan and us are very tense now. Even though Ling Dong Xing can counterattack with Ma Da Jun's help, the Cheng Clan is not easily trifled with. Force them into a corner and they would definitely put their all into the fight.\"\"At that moment, we will give Ling Dong Xing an additional stab in the back, and shove him off the position of the clan head!\"Ling Mu Yun's face lit up upon hearing this, but his eyes were filled with a poisonous rage, \"Grandfather, that brat Ling Han must be handed over to me, I want to kill him with my own hands!\"\"You will definitely get your wish!\" Ling Zhong Kuan said with a cold smile.***The next morning, Zhu He Xin once again visited the Ling Clan. Now Ling Dong Xing finally understood why Ma Da Jun had been so reverent towards his son. It was because even a Black Grade alchemist such as Zhu He Xin would stand with both hands at his sides in front of his son--the epitome of an obedient student.This solved the mystery yet caused Ling Dong Xing to be even more shocked. Because, in the last case, it was only a Yellow Grade alchemist, but now even a Black Grade alchemist was so reverent towards his son. What was going on here?The reason behind Zhu He Xin's visit was to pass on some news to Ling Han.There was news that a stalk of Earth Dragon Grass may have appeared on Seven Wind Mountains.When Liu Yu Tong had gone to purchase the ingredients for concocting the Little Cloud and Water Pill a few days ago, she had also asked Zhu He Xin about the ingredients for another pill formula. This pill formula had a total of four ingredients that belonged to the 'extremely rare' category. Even Heaven's Medicine Pavilion did not have any of these ingredients in stock.Or rather, the branch in Rain Country did not have them in stock. However, based on his current rank, Zhu He Xin had no way of checking the stock of the bigger branches, not to mention transferring something over.This pill formula was the formula required to concoct a pill to heal Ling Dong Xing's Spirit Base. The name of the pill was \"Restore Spirit Pill\", an Earth Grade medium level pill!Earth Dragon Grass was one of the four missing ingredients this pill formula required. Thus, once he received this piece of new, Zhu He Xin quickly came to personally visit the Ling Residence. Of course, while one reason was to inform Ling Han of the important news, he also wanted to come and seek guidance from Ling Han. At other times, he would not dare to come and disturb Ling Han.Ling Han was naturally elated. But after he had carefully asked about the circumstances surrounding the Seven Wind Mountains, he could only decide to temporarily postpone the trip.The reason was, the person who brought the news was a strong warrior of the ninth layer of Element Gathering Tier. By the time he was found by a team of herb gatherers, he was already close to death. He only managed to say \"cave\", \"giant red snake\" and \"Earth Dragon Grass\" before he died.Thus, this led to the conclusion that there was Earth Dragon Grass within the Seven Wind Mountains, yet there should be a giant red snake standing guard over it. It even managed to severely injure a strong warrior of the ninth layer of Element Gathering Tier.Yet Ling Han knew that where there was Earth Dragon Grass, there would usually be a Red Scaled Dragon Snake coiled nearby. The snake would absorb the weak Dragon Qi released by the Earth Dragon Grass to slowly evolve and complete the transformation from a snake to a dragon.A mature Red Scaled Dragon Snake would possess cultivation comparable to the ninth layer of Element Gathering Tier. Furthermore, because it possessed a bit of the dragon's bloodline, its power far exceeded an ordinary warrior of the ninth layer of Element Gathering Tier. It could be considered to have one foot in the Gushing Spring Tier and was an invincible king of the Element Gathering Tier.Should Ling Han enter the Seven Wind Mountains at this stage... even if he managed to find that \"cave\", there was no way he could be an equal opponent to the Red Scaled Dragon Snake--it would be useless even with the help of Liu Yu Tong, unless Liu Yu Tong had one foot in the Gushing Spring Tier as well.He would definitely go to the Seven Wind Mountains, but he had to make full preparation for the trip.Moreover, the inner core of the Red Scaled Dragon Snake could be refined into a Transcending Origin Pill. Taking this pill would allow a martial artist in the Element Gathering Tier to directly advance one layer--with the limit being the peak of the third layer of Element Gathering Tier. Additionally, because the Red Scaled Dragon Snake possessed a bit of the dragon's bloodline, its blood and flesh were extremely nutritious and would allow Ling Han to grasp the Dead Tree Tier, the first tier of the Indestructible Heaven Scroll, at a faster rate.He decided to continue working hard at cultivation and only set off towards Seven Wind Mountains once he had broken through to the Element Gathering Tier. He'd also be able to make use of the inner core of the Dragon Snake to quickly raise his cultivation level to the third layer of Element Gathering Tier then, after which he would easily break through to the fourth layer.Additionally, he also had to raise his own power through actual battle experience and strengthen his foundation. While in his last life he had stood at the summit of martial arts, to be honest, he was not considered the one with the strongest battle power.There was a simple reason for that. His cultivation progress was faster than an average cultivator's because he had possessed a Heaven Grade high level Spirit Base, but if he battled with a warrior of the same cultivation level, he would still have to take into account his opponent's battle tactics and the level of control he had over his use of martial arts skills.In his last life, Ling Han was definitely extremely intelligent, for how else could he become the first Alchemy Emperor ever--a record that no one has ever managed to achieve and likely no one else will ever achieve? However, there were definitely limits to one's time and energy. He had spent most of his time on alchemy research and concocting alchemical pills. Whatever time he had left he spent on raising his cultivation level, so how much time did he have left to refine his martial arts skills?But this was no problem, for his cultivation progress was much too fast. With the additional support of alchemical pills, how could his opponents be able to compare with him? He only had to use the difference in cultivation levels to crush his opponents. He needed not use any kind of tactics.But once he reached the summit of martial arts, this weakness was revealed.In Ling Han's last life, there were in total seven strong warriors of the Heaven Tier. Based purely on actual battle power, he was definitely at the bottom. The reason was the fact that he had depended on the use of alchemical pills to increase his cultivation level and didn't really have much of an actual battle experience.It could be said that his cultivation level of Heaven Tier had actually been quite hollow!Of course, if he had spent more than one hundred years to continue training in martial arts skills, he would definitely be able to compensate for this inadequacy. After all, he was still too young. A threehundred-year-old of the Heaven Tier was still a very rare existence in history--such people could be counted on the fingers of one hand.In this life, Ling Han no longer wanted to become this kind of paper tiger warrior, so he definitely needed to leave a deep footprint behind his every step--each step had to be taken firmly.Ling Han had no excess thoughts. Aside from cultivating the Five Elements Heaven Grade Skill everyday, he also began to refine his martial arts skills. In his last life, he had given up on using Yellow Grade and Black Grade martial arts skills at a very early stage. He had mostly just stuck to using Heaven Grade martial arts skills, and only sometimes would he deign to use Earth Grade martial arts skills.But now, he could only use Yellow Grade martial arts skills. As a result, he needed to work very hard on cultivating and make himself become an indomitable ruler of all those with the same cultivation level, and not just obtain his victories by taking advantage of the difference in cultivation level between him and his opponents.However, he had in his hands a large variety of high-level martial art skills, but very few low-level ones.That was natural. In his previous life, he had been a strong warrior of Heaven Tier. Even if he had discovered any Black Grade or Yellow Grade martial arts skills in a historical site, how would it be possible that he would train in any of them? He may flip through some of them, but there were definitely few of them.Thankfully, he had also been a martial artist that had slowly worked his way up from the bottom in his last life, so he still possessed a few low-level martial arts skills.Shocking Electricity Sword Arts, Flying Fire Palm Arts, Dashing Panther Fist, and Exiting Cloud Step were all Yellow Grade high level martial arts skills.However, what caused Ling Han to feel a little embarrassed was the fact that he had not cultivated these four martial arts skills to the highest level in his last life, for he was always busy with concocting pills.So, he just had to start all over again. He was still young anyways.Ling Han began with Shocking Electricity Sword Arts. The reason was simple. His current cultivation level was still too low, so he needed the support of a weapon to increase his strength, and the favorite weapon of most martial artists were either a sword or a saber.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 27": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Alchemy Emperor of the Divine DaoCH 27Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLing Han decided to head to Balance Mountain for training.Balance Mountain was about eighty kilometers north of Gray Cloud Town. It was not a very large mountain. Even the continuous length and breadth of it measured just over one hundred kilometres. There were four towns within the mountain's vicinity, and their residents largely depended on the mountain for their livelihood.The reason being, this mountain had both medicinal herbs as well as demonic beasts, and to a martial artist, both of these things were beneficial.Unlike the gigantic mountain range that was the Seven Wind Mountains, where the demonic beasts were extremely powerful to the point that even strong warriors of the Spiritual Ocean Tier dared not venture too deeply, the strongest demonic beast in Balance Mountain was only in the Element Gathering Tier and could only be found in the innermost parts of the mountain range. Thus, as long as they did not venture too deeply into the mountain range, Balance Mountain was an excellent training grounds for a martial artist in the Body Refining Tier.Ling Han knew very well that purely practicing would never let him train in a martial arts skill to the highest level. To achieve that, he had to experience actual battle!Although Ling Dong Xing did not want his son to take risks, he also knew that it was impossible for a real martial artist to grow up protected like a plant in a greenhouse. Moreover, Liu Yu Tong would be by Ling Han's side to protect him, so naturally he did not need to worry that they would encounter some danger. Therefore, he agreed.He was also very busy now. He was currently making preparations for the counterattack against the Cheng Clan while also reorganizing the Ling Clan to regain power over the clan, which Ling Zhong Kuan had partially taken over these past few years.Ling Han and Liu Yu Tong very quickly began their journey, setting off towards Balance Mountain.As Balance Mountain was quite close by, they did not need to bring too much baggage with them and had only brought two, three changes of clothing. Yet, even so, they still carried a sizable bundle, each.This caused Ling Han to miss the spatial ring from his previous life.A spatial ring seemed to be not much different from a normal ring, yet there was an incredible space within it that could accommodate a large number of items. If you were going on a trip, bringing a spatial ring along would be very convenient.However, the method to create spatial rings was long lost with the passage of time, so there was only an extremely limited number available. In his last life, only a strong warrior of at least Flower Blossom Tier could possess one. Otherwise, even if you had very luckily obtained one, it would still bring a fatal disaster to you as its owner!A spatial ring was something extremely valuable.They traveled by foot. A distance of eighty kilometers was nothing much to a martial artist and they only spent about two hours on their journey. The two of them set off in the morning, and they had already entered the vicinity of Balance Mountain by noon.They could hear the distant roars of tigers and cries of monkeys. As they looked everything over, a strongly fragrant, primitive, desolate air blew against their faces.\"Let's go!\" Ling Han walked in front, and said, \"As long as it's a demonic beast in the Body Refining Tier, you don't have to do anything. Just leave it to me.\"\"Very well,\" Liu Yu Tong nodded.However, Balance Mountain was not a place that was filled to the brim with demonic beasts. Although the two deliberately searched for them, they did not encounter even one. They didn't even encounter any ordinary wild beast. As the sky slowly darkened, the two of them began to feel hungry.They had only brought a small amount of food as emergency rations. They had actually intended to hunt the demonic beasts on the mountain for food.\"We have to quickly hunt a demonic beast. Otherwise, we'll have to go hungry tonight,\" Ling Han said as he brandished the iron sword in his hand. He had bought the sword before he had departed for the journey. It was considerably expensive, being priced at ten silver coins. It would be enough against a demonic beast of Body Refining Tier, but against a demonic beast of Element Gathering Tier, it wouldn't even be able to break through its defense.Moreover, he was not an equal opponent for a demonic beast in the Element Gathering Tier anyway.Liu Yu Tong suddenly stopped walking.\"What is it, have you heard something?\" Ling Han said with a bit of excitement.\"My shoelaces came undone,\" Liu Yu Tong crouched down.He never imagined that this woman had a bit of a sense of humor. Ling Han shrugged and waited until Liu Yu Tong stood up. The two of them then continued their way forward. However, they had not walked too far before Liu Yu Tong once again crouched down.\"Your shoelaces came undone again?\" Ling Han asked.\"No, I heard something!\" Liu Yu Tong looked over in a particular direction. Her expression was still icy cold.This woman definitely had a cold sense of humor.Ling Han too glanced in the same direction. Liu Yu Tong was in the Element Gathering Tier, so her sight and hearing were much stronger than his. The shrubs in front of them were shaking, as if something was making its way out.Very quickly, a gigantic wolf's head emerged, rapidly followed by the appearance of its body. It was about the size of a water buffalo and was blood-red in color, though its skin had several rotting scars scattered all over its body. It looked a little disgusting.\"Our luck's not bad, this is a Rotten Blood Wolf!\" Ling Han's eyes lit up. Cultivating the Indestructible Heaven Scroll required various valuable materials to support his training, and the fresh blood of demonic beasts was currently the best material available, while the Rotten Blood Wolf could be considered as one of the strongest demonic beasts in the Body Refining Tier.\"Be careful!\" Liu Yu Tong reminded. A mature Rotten Blood Wolf was a being in the ninth layer of Body Refining Tier. Other than that, demonic beasts always had a big advantage over humanity when it came to strength and defense, and that was the case even when a demonic beast and a human cultivator had similar cultivation.The advantage of martial artists, on the other hand, was in the fact that they could use various martial arts skills and weapons to greatly increase their own power.However, Ling Han was only in the seventh layer of Body Refining Tier now. There was too big a gap between him and the Rotten Blood Wolf. Moreover, a martial artist could die at any moment in a battle against a demonic beast. The battle would not end even if you shout \"Stop\" or \"I give up\".\"Don't worry!\" Ling Han smiled. Wielding the iron sword in his hand, his expression immediately became serious.The Rotten Blood Wolf continuously released deep growls. In front of it stood two people. The man did not look very threatening to it, but the woman standing behind him caused the wolf to feel dread. However, due to the ferocious nature of a demonic beast, it was not willing to give up its prey.The blood and flesh of demonic beasts were considered extremely nutritious to any martial artist, but martial artists were likewise a very nutritious meal to demonic beasts.The Rotten Blood Wolf was very cautious. It did not attack right away.\"Yu Tong, step back,\" Ling Han said. Wolves were an extremely patient, very careful species. It must have sensed Liu Yu Tong's hidden strength.Liu Yu Tong frowned faintly. Considering the current distance, she would be able to help him in time if he needed it. But if this distance increased, then should Ling Han encounter any danger, she might not be able to do anything to help him.\"Trust me,\" Ling Han smiled.Liu Yu Tong finally stepped back slowly.The Rotten Blood Wolf's ferocious nature was immediately roused. The claws of its front paws dug into the ground and its jaws opened, revealing two rows of sharp dagger-like teeth, exuding a cold air.Ling Han crooked his finger, and said, \"You big stupid dog, come, come, come!\"\"Ao!\" The Rotten Blood Wolf released a howl, pouncing abruptly at a very surprising speed.Ling Han did not panic. With a wave of his long sword, the Shocking Electricity Sword Arts had already been initiated.\"Shua!\" Only one sword stabbed forward yet two flashes of cold light appeared. One of them was the sword itself, while the other was a white-colored energy.\"Sword Qi!\" Liu Yu Tong could not help breathing out in shock.Sword Qi was the symbol of a swordsman, just like a saber's wielder needed to have Saber Qi. It was incomparably sharp, and extremely powerful.She had not formed Sword Qi yet she knew the difficulty of achieving it--she had an uncle who had been acclaimed as a genius in the art of the sword, yet he had only formed Sword Qi after five years of immersing himself in the path of the sword.Was this guy really human?Ling Han felt no surprise however. Forming Sword Qi was only a natural course of event, his goal was Sword Point! [1]Sword Point was the solid form of Sword Qi. Its power was even stronger. Unfortunately, he had not spent much time on sword arts in his last life so he had only formed Sword Qi, and did not manage to form Sword Point.The prerequisite for forming Sword Point was that one thrust of the sword would have tens of flashes of Sword Qi, which then had to be condensed into Sword Point. Just now, he had only managed to release one flash of Sword Qi. He still had a very long way to go.The next step from Sword Point was Sword Heart. This was the highest level one could achieve on the path of the sword.However, against a Rotten Blood Wolf, one flash of Sword Qi was more than enough.[1] ED/N: I know it sounds a bit average in English, but it sounds cool in Chinese (apparently) and it's very difficult to find a cool, appropriate and more figurative translation. Btw, \"point\" is the official English name for the tip of a sword's blade (no, it has nothing to do with a certain reindeer who ate hito hito no mi).Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 28": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Alchemy Emperor of the Divine DaoCH 28Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAs the Shocking Electricity Sword Arts unfolded, Ling Han's long sword moved freely, his figure graceful.Accompanying the display of Shocking Electricity Sword Arts was the Exiting Cloud Step. Every step was about four or five metres long, sometimes to the left, sometimes to the right, suddenly forwards, suddenly backwards. His steps appeared strange and were extremely quick, becoming a blur to any observer's eyes.Liu Yu Tong looked on from the side and could not help nodding her head in secret.If she suppressed her cultivation level to the seventh layer of Body Refining Tier, she would definitely not be able to perform as well as Ling Han. Rather, she would probably be facing danger from all sides by now. After all, there was a big difference in cultivation level between Ling Han and his opponent--two layers. Furthermore, the opponent was a demonic beast.Normally, in a battle between a martial artist and a demonic beast, the martial artist needed to have a slight advantage in cultivation level to attain victory. If the cultivation levels of the martial artist and the demonic beast were about the same, then the martial artist had a higher chance of losing. After all, not every martial artist was a battle genius.Ling Han's sword moves were becoming more and more fluid. His steps were natural and smooth as he enjoyed the pleasure of battling.He had really put too much focus into the path of alchemy in his last life. In terms of martial arts, he used to care about cultivation level only. His whole \"journey\" upwards had just been a superficial understanding of martial arts. But this time, as he once again stepped onto the path of martial arts, he suddenly discovered that martial arts could actually be very interesting too.The Rotten Blood Wolf had become his sparring partner, allowing him to practice his moves to his heart's content, tempering his grasp of the Shocking Electricity Sword Arts.Ten minutes later, the Rotten Blood Wolf was already covered with cuts and bruises. This caused it to become very fearful. This seemingly weak human was actually so powerful! It did not want to retreat, but it feared even more that not only would the two not become an offering to its fangs, but it itself would become a meal for these two humans.\"There's no escape!\" Ling Han laughed loudly. The sword moved as he willed it to. Two flashes of Sword Qi were simultaneously released in between the glints of cold light.Two flashes of Sword Qi! He had finally broke through!\"Pu!\" Blood splattered as a crimson flower suddenly blossomed on the neck of the Rotten Blood Wolf. Its large body toppled over with a loud noise, its eyes open wide as if it still could not believe that a human at the seventh layer of Body Refining Tier would actually be able to kill it!Demonic beasts had a very high level of intelligence. Powerful demonic beasts could even possibly have intelligence comparable to a human's.Ling Han nodded. The power of two flashes of Sword Qi was indeed huge. Previously, one flash of Sword Qi only allowed him to fight on equal footing with the Rotten Blood Wolf, but two flashes allowed him to kill it in an instant! As expected, even if the cultivation level was the same, there could still be a large discrepancy in actual strength of different martial artists.At the side, Liu Yu Tong was once again shocked into speechlessness.Just this little bit of time, and Ling Han had improved from one flash of Sword Qi to two. If that uncle of hers knew about this, wouldn't he be shamed to the point of jumping into a river and drown himself? As that uncle of hers had spent more than thirty years to form four flashes of Sword Qi, he was already acclaimed as a genius swordsman by the whole clan. But, when compared to Ling Han....However, she did not know how far ahead Ling Han's starting line was, or how terrifying his comprehension ability was. Otherwise, how would he have been able to achieve Heaven Tier by two hundred years old in his last life?\"Dinner's settled!\" Ling Han said with a smile.The two of them found a small brook. Settling by the brook, they cleaned the body of the Rotten Blood Wolf. They naturally wouldn't waste the blood of a demonic beast and so poured all the blood into a pouch. Afterwards, Ling Han would bath himself in the blood to absorb the essence of it to temper his own body.They started a fire and cut off the wolf's leg for barbecue. After sprinkling some salt on it, a fragrant aroma very quickly wafted out.There shouldn't be too many demands when on a trip out in the wilderness. After they had washed the wolf's leg with clean water from the brook and it had dried, the sky had already completely darkened. They did not continue their journey onwards. Instead, they both sat cross-legged by the brook and began cultivating.Ling Han bathed himself in the blood of the demonic beast. He started to circulate Indestructible Heaven Scroll to extract the concentrated essence of the blood for his own use.After merely slightly more than ten minutes, this dense, sticky beast's blood became watery and diluted. The essence within it was already completely spent.'Like I thought... improving one's physique is truly quite difficult!' Ling Han thought.Let's use an example. If a martial artist in the Element Gathering Tier was consciously defending using Origin Power covering his body while being freely attacked by a martial artist of Body Refining Tier, it would be impossible for the latter to break through this layer of defense. However, if they didn't try to defend, the defense of a martial artist of Element Gathering Tier was not much stronger than a martial artist's of Body Refining Tier.For instance, should a martial artist in Element Gathering Tier be ambushed by a martial artist in Body Refining Tier when asleep, then the chances were high that he would die due to his carelessness.Meanwhile, strengthening one's physique would ensure that this defense would be a passive and permanent one, active even when asleep or unconscious. However, the strengthening of the physique was an extremely difficult task that required the expense of a large amount of valuable natural treasures.Ling Han had been the previous type, and had not spent much effort on strengthening his physique in his last life.Of course, the reason why the beast's blood could be refined so quickly was because the Indestructible Heaven Scroll was much too powerful and shockingly efficient. Otherwise, for other kinds of cultivation techniques like Stone Skin Skill, it might require about three or four days' time to be completely refined.Ling Han could clearly feel that his muscles had become denser and his skin tougher. If a sharp piece of rock was drawn over his skin, the most it would do would be leaving behind a white mark.Very soon, he should be able to achieve the physique of Dead Tree Tier.After the night had passed, the two of them continued their journey on the mountain, seeking demonic beasts to battle.From the second day onwards, it seemed as if their luck had taken a turn for the better as they continuously encountered demonic beasts. This did not just provide Ling Han with a very good chance for accumulating actual battle experience, but also provided him with a large supply of beasts' blood, allowing him to continuously advance in his cultivation of Indestructible Heaven Scroll.On the fourth day, they exited the forest and saw five people sitting in a clearing not too far ahead. The five of them looked as if they had gone through a huge battle, every one of them looking quite miserable.These five were all youngsters, all of them less than twenty years old. Three of the group had achieved the ninth layer of Body Refining Tier while the other two were in the eighth layer. In a small place like Gray Cloud Town, based on their individual cultivation level, the five of them could definitely be praised as geniuses.Liu Yu Tong immediately took out a veil to conceal her face. She was born too beautiful and her unworldly beauty easily caused problems--though she herself had no fear of such problems.\"Brother, which town are you from?\" One of the young men asked. His tone was filled with confidence, hinting that he should be from some large, wealthy clan.Ling Han smiled, and said, \"Gray Cloud Town.\"\"We're all from Guo Rock Town,\" That young man continued to say, and began to introduce his group, \"I am Liu Dong, he's Chen Peng Ju, he's Li Hao, that guy's Zhou Chang, and this beauty here is Zhu Xue, the noble Miss Zhu.\" [1]Ling Han nodded at the five of them, and said, \"I'm Ling Han, and this here is Liu Yu Tong.\"\"Ling Han, we discovered a Green Spiritual Fruit just now, yet there is a very powerful demonic beast standing guard nearby, so we have no way of getting to it. How about it, are you interested in working together with us?\" Liu Dong suggested to Ling Han. The reason behind his friendly attitude was revealed by his words.\"Oh?\" Ling Han's heart stirred. A Green Spiritual Fruit would not only improve the cultivation level of a martial artist, it was also very beneficial for a martial artist preparing to break through to the Element Gathering Tier. The five people in front of him were very close to achieving the peak of the ninth layer of Body Refining Tier. Should they consume a Green Spiritual Fruit at this stage, it would be extremely helpful to their breakthrough.Spiritual Fruits were different from alchemical pills. They were completely natural treasures, so consuming them had no side effects, unlike how it was the case with alchemical pills--if one were to continuously take alchemical pills, traces of poisonous impurities present in alchemical pills would accumulate within their body. However, there were some Spiritual Fruits that possessed effects so strong that they had to be refined into pills before they could be consumed. Otherwise, it would be the same as committing suicide.\"What level is that demonic beast?\" Ling Han asked.\"Miasma Cloud Beast, ninth layer of Body Refining Tier,\" Zhou Chang replied.Ling Han suddenly understood why even these five people were powerless. As the Miasma Cloud Beast would continuously release large amounts of poisonous miasma during battle, fighters had to hold their breath. However, in a violent battle, even for a martial artist, how long would they be able to hold their breath for?Thus, without crushing power to end the battle in a very short period of time, there would be no way to defeat a Miasma Cloud Beast.\"However, you must first receive a saber attack from me to prove that you possess sufficient strength,\" Li Hao spoke and brandished the saber in his hand, his face showing a very cool expression, fully intent on showing off.[1] ED/N: Guo = outer city wall. See why it's not TLed completely now?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Furthermore, his nickname is Saber Maniac. He never jokes around when talking about sabers,\" Zhu Xue Yi cautioned, \"If your cultivation level is not above the seventh layer of Body Refining Tier, then it's better if you don't take his attacks head on.\"Ling Han nodded with a smile, and said, \"I only need to take one attack from you?\"\"Just one!\" Li Hao continued to say very coolly and arrogantly, looking like some kind of master swordsman.\"Very well, come on then,\" Ling Han did not boast of his own abilities, nor did he display any disdain towards his opponent. He only nodded very calmly in response.Li Hao moved and arrived in front of Ling Han. His right hand was placed on the hilt of the saber at his waist, but he made no move to draw it out yet. His left foot was in front while his right foot remained at the back. His upper body leaned slightly forwards, his expression one of complete concentration.Ling Han was slightly surprised--this guy actually looked a little decent, and vaguely had the bearing of a swordsman.Li Hao drew his saber abruptly, and a flash of cold light blazed and slashed swiftly towards Ling Han.\"Ding!\"A sharp sound echoed and sparks flew. Ling Han managed to draw his sword in time, scraping it against the blade of the saber. However, the long sword did not go against the saber head on. Instead, it drew all the way from the saber's tip right to the saber's hilt and in this way managed to dissipate the heavy weight of the saber.The sword's movement was extremely quick!Li Hao's saber attack was unexpectedly ended.Zhu Xue Yi and the rest of her companions were all shocked. The power Ling Han displayed in this one strike was obviously only the seventh layer of Body Refining Tier, yet he managed to dissolve Li Hao's full-power slash, exhibiting more than exceptional sword skills.\"You pass,\" Li Hao nodded, a very arrogant expression on his face.Yet Ling Han gave a flick of his long sword, and said, \"You too should take an attack from me!\"\"Haha, are you testing me?\" Li Hao gave a big laugh. Although Ling Han managed to take a saber attack from him, this did not signify that he would be able to fight on even footing with him. These were completely two different issues.\"Something like that,\" Ling Han said with a smile. \"Do you dare?\"\"Then bring it on!\" Li Hao said confidently. When they exchanged blows previously, he had confirmed that Ling Han's cultivation level was only in the seventh layer of Body Refining Tier. Although the two of them were both similarly in the late stage of Body Refining Tier, the difference of two layers was still very distinct.The sword in Ling Han's hand moved in an elaborate manner and suddenly pierced forwards, aiming directly at Li Hao's neck.Li Hao naturally did not fear Ling Han's attack. He brandished his saber in a block. With a \"ding\", the long sword stopped its approach right in front of his throat, missing by a hair's breadth.\"You've lost,\" Ling Han withdrew his sword.\"I clearly blocked your-\"Li Hao was just about to speak, when he saw that Ling Han gave a flick of his sword, and a ray of white-colored cold light flashed swiftly.\"Sword Qi!\" Liu Dong and his company simultaneously gasped in shock.Li Hao could not help the darkening of his expression. He naturally knew the power of Sword Qi, so he nodded and said, \"I've lost!\" If Ling Han had released Sword Qi just now, then he currently would only be a dead body.Liu Dong and company were shocked half to death. The fact that Ling Han had managed to parry Li Hao's saber previously had already made them feel very impressed. But now this was actually a guy who had even formed Sword Qi... he really was inconceivable.Li Hao's fighting spirit rose again, and said, \"Let us spar once more!\" He had not yet experienced a battle with someone who could form Sword Qi. This was a rare opportunity.\"Very well!\" Ling Han nodded in agreement. He had a slight intent to train Li Hao as he thought that this brat would be able to step onto the path of an actual swordsman. As he spoke, his right hand flicked, and his long sword once again flashed out.Li Hao naturally would give it his best, and hurriedly brandished his saber in a slash. He wanted to use the weight of the saber to force Ling Han to fly out of the spar. He opted to attack instead of pure defense.\"Ding, ding, ding, ding,\" the two fighters battled fiercely. Li Hao was not \"instantly killed\" this round. However, he suffered quite a bit as Ling Han had started to use Sword Qi, which left many wounds on Li Hao's body.Tens of moves later, Li Hao decisively surrendered. If they continued to battle, he might really bleed to death.\"Sword Qi is indeed powerful!\" He said, both frustrated and excited. Should he be able to form Saber Qi, then the situation might be completely different.\"Do not be discouraged, you are already quite skilled,\" Ling Han said aptly.Although he had not spent much time on sword arts in his last life, how intelligent was he? Moreover, he had once achieved the summit of Heaven Tier. His one day's training would be comparable to a year's training of a person in Body Refining Tier... or even a few years' training!Just how old was Li Hao that he could actually spar with him?Zhu Xue Yi and company were both shocked and overjoyed. Their shock was due to the fact that Li Hao was the strongest amongst them yet was still unfit to be Ling Han's opponent. Their joy was because their chances of obtaining the Green Spiritual Fruit had increased greatly now with the help of such a master swordsman.The group of seven set off on their way to where the Green Spiritual Fruit was located.\"So it seems that Brother Ling is the heir to the Ling Clan of Gray Cloud Town. That's strange, we should have long heard of a genius existence like Brother Ling,\" on the way to their destination, Ling Han had become the focus of the five young people's attention, and so naturally was barraged by their questions.This was normal--his predecessor had no idea that he had possessed an Immortal Grade Spirit Base, neither did he know the Five Elements Heaven Grade Skill. It'd be strange if he was well-known.Ling Han only answered that he had been more subdued in the past, and thus deflected this question.Though Zhu Xue Yi and her companions also had much interest in Liu Yu Tong, she was icily silent all the while, and Ling Han too did not seem like he was going to introduce her, thus they could only feel curious in their hearts.Close to an hour later, they finally arrived at an extremely moist place. In front of them, there suddenly appeared a cave. They hadn't even entered the cave yet but could already smell a disgusting stink. However, they could vaguely see a plant that was about a meter tall--its stem had no leaves, looking like a sugarcane. However, there hung several fruits from it, neither too many nor too few--exactly seven of them.\"If we go any closer, we'd be affected by the miasma poison. We must hold our breaths if we want to advance forwards.\"\"That Miasma Cloud Beast is very cunning, it would definitely not leave the sphere of influence of the miasma poison.\"\"We have to draw that Miasma Cloud Beast out. As long as we can obstruct it for a few breaths' time, we'll be able to extract the Spiritual Fruits.\"\"Miss Liu and Xue Yi will be responsible for extracting the Green Spiritual Fruits. Us five men will be in charge of obstructing the Miasma Cloud Beast. Agreed?\"This was mostly directed at Ling Han.They would both have one person on the team obtain the fruits to avoid either party snatching the fruits and fleeing.Ling Han smiled and nodded. If they knew what Liu Yu Tong's cultivation level was, then they probably might not offer this kind of suggestion.\"We have to draw the Miasma Cloud Beast out first. If we start the battle in the cave, then we would not be able to take advantage of our superior numbers,\" Zhou Chang said.\"En!\"The five men all drew out their respective weapons, banging them against each other to create a clamor.It took only a while before a creature which looked similar to a wild hog ran out of the cave. There were air sacs all over its body that kept on releasing a gray fog. Two long, thick fangs protruded outside its lips, looking like two short spears, exuding a strong pressure.This was the Miasma Cloud Beast. With its power, it could be considered to be in the upper echelons of the Body Refining Tier's demonic beasts.The Miasma Cloud Beast appeared at the cave entrance, yet it did not attack. It only growled deeply and bared its teeth at the five humans in front of it. The air sacs all over its body continuously released a gray fog, forming a dark cloud above it.\"Let's go!\" Zhou Chang gave a loud shout and made the first move. Liu Dong, Chen Peng Ju and Li Hao followed closely behind. The four of them simultaneously brandished their respective weapons and flew towards the Miasma Cloud Beast.However, Ling Han made no movement. Instead, he stayed behind, silently watching.Four against one... although Li Hao and his companions had the advantage in numbers, under the continuous influence of the poisonous miasma, they could not display their full prowess and very quickly were on the losing side.They could not help feeling very worried--hadn't they made an agreement to join forces and attack together? Why was Ling Han just standing there by the side and watching?\"Shua!\" Right at that moment, Ling Han drew his sword quickly, as if he was moving at the speed of light.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 30": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Alchemy Emperor of the Divine DaoCH 30Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis sword move was really very cleverly timed as the Miasma Cloud Beast had just defended against the combined attacks of Liu Dong and his companions and its defense had weakened, creating an opportunity for Ling Han.\"Shua!\" The long sword waved, seemingly like a deity descended from the heavens.With a \"pu\" sound, the sword pierced through the right eye of the Miasma Cloud Beast and deeper into its body, driving in all the way until the hilt.\"Peng!\" The Miasma Cloud Beast fell heavily onto the ground. It was actually killed in one blow!\"What!\"\"Mother!\"\"Si!\"Liu Dong and the others, including Zhu Xue Yi who had been in hiding, inhaled sharply in shock.That was an actual Miasma Cloud Beast, one of the strongest amongst demonic beasts in Body Refining Tier! And yet, it was killed in one blow! How could they accept something this unbelievable?But immediately, they took to their heels. If one spoke, they would naturally inhale air. They had all inhaled a bit of miasma poison just now, thus they had to circulate their respective cultivation techniques as soon as possible to dissolve the poison. Otherwise, their internal organs could very likely corrode.After a while, Liu Dong was the first to walk towards Ling Han, and patting his shoulder, he said, \"I thought you brat were already scared to the point that you couldn't move, but you're actually so strong. Your one strike could actually be so swift.\"\"Haha, Brother Ling is truly powerful to actually kill the Miasma Cloud Beast in one blow!\" Li Hao said. To be able to witness such a clean, decisive slash, he too felt immeasurably excited since he was a swordsman himself.Ling Han only smiled. The lower the cultivation level, the easier it would be for one with a lower cultivation level to challenge someone with a higher cultivation level. Moreover, the Miasma Cloud Beast had had most of its attention focused on Liu Dong and the rest just now, which gave him the chance to kill it in one strike.If it was a one-on-one battle, Ling Han would definitely not be able to fight the Miasma Cloud Beast on even grounds--unless he had taken the antidote to the miasma poison beforehand.After the miasma poison had dissipated, they plucked the Green Spiritual Fruits one by one, but did not damage the plant itself.The plan they came up with just now was because they were short on time, and so could only choose to uproot the plant. But now that the Miasma Cloud Beast was dead, they naturally had no need to do such a thing. This after all was a natural spiritual medicine. Damaging it would equal damaging the harmony of nature.Seven Green Spiritual Fruits--they each could obtain one. However, though Liu Yu Tong had put hers away, she would definitely hand it over to Ling Han later.\"Heng, leave the spiritual fruits behind!\" They heard a cold voice speak. Two men walked over to them, one in front while the other remaining behind. One was young while the other was old. The younger one seemed to be about twenty plus years old, while the older man appeared to be about seventy or eighty years old, with a head full of white hair.The speaker was the young man. He was walking in front while the old man followed him from behind like a servant.Ling Han glanced at the approaching pair. With the insight of a warrior in Heaven Tier, he could immediately tell that the young man was in the ninth layer of Body Refining Tier while the old man had already reached the ninth layer of Element Gathering Tier!\"Who do you think you are to be so arrogant?\" Liu Dong immediately stood, yelling at the unknown young man.However, that young man's gaze swept over Zhu Xue Yi's dainty figure and beautiful face, revealing a covetous expression. Then, he disdainfully said, \"You don't even know I, Hang Zhan? Hehe, then you should have heard of Stone Wolf Sect, right? I am the eldest grandson of the Seventh Elder of Stone Wolf Sect!\"Stone Wolf Sect!Hearing these three words, the expressions on the faces of Liu Dong and the others all changed into ones filled with dread.In Rain Country, one couldn't casually casually proclaim themselves a sect or a faction. Faction, Sect, Association, and Society--from highest to lowest, these were the four different levels. Only a party that possessed a warrior of the Spiritual Ocean Tier could claim to be a Faction, one with a master in the Gushing Spring Tier could be proclaimed a Sect... a party that only had a warrior in Element Gathering Tier could be claimed as Association, while Society would be those in the lowest category.The Stone Wolf Sect was the greatest party within one thousand miles. According to rumors, the Nine Great Elders were all warriors in the Gushing Spring Tier, while the Sect Master was an individual standing at the pinnacle of the ninth layer of Gushing Spring Tier.If this Hang Zhan was telling the truth and his grandfather really was the Seventh Elder of the Stone Wolf Gate, then he indeed had a terrifying background.\"Hahahaha, now do you know who I am? Leave the Spiritual Fruits and all of you break one of your arms, then you can get lost! However, these two girls must stay behind!\" Hang Zhan once again looked at Liu Yu Tong. Although he could not see her face, her graceful figure still caused his heart to throb.With his rich experience of encounters with women, this girl definitely had to be a beauty.Liu Dong and his fellows were extremely furious. They could leave behind the Spiritual Fruits, but to actually have each of them break one of their arms? Should a martial artist break his own arm, that would be the same as destroying his own future! Zhu Xue Yi shivered. She knew why he wanted her to stay behind, and this made her feel disgusted, furious and fearful, all at the same time. [1]\"Do you still intend to resist me?\" Hang Zhan smiled coldly, \"Elder Yu, make them feel despair!\"\"Yes, Young Master!\" The white-haired old man behind him replied respectfully before slowly walking over to them.He originally had a bent figure, being the embodiment of a senile old man. Yet now, his back straightened a bit with each step and his aura kept increasing, quickly causing Liu Dong and the others to pale.Ninth layer of Element Gathering Tier!In truth, Liu Dong and the others could not tell what \"Elder Yu\"'s cultivation level was. They only knew that he was much, much stronger--stronger than them by a large margin. But no matter what layer of Element Gathering Tier he was at, to suppress a few youngsters in Body Refining Tier would be as easy as flipping his hand over.They were finished!Liu Dong and the others looked ashen. Although they were extremely unwilling, they could not help but admit that their backgrounds could not compare with the newcomer's. As for comparing their own strength with their opponents', they were also unable to do so.\"You, take off your veil!\" Hang Zhan said, pointing at Liu Yu Tong. The more he stared at Liu Yu Tong's figure, the more the fire in his heart blazed and the more he wanted to see her true face.Should Liu Yu Tong's true appearance not reach his expectations, he would definitely kill her in one strike for making him expect this much for nothing.Consequences?Hang Zhan naturally never thought about such a thing. The Stone Wolf Sect was the king in this area. As long as they did nothing treasonous towards Rain Country, then so what if he killed a few people?Liu Yu Tong naturally would not even bother to respond.\"En? Did you not hear me?\" Hang Zhan was a little upset. He was used to being arrogant and bossy; the thing that infuriated him the most was if someone dared to disobey his commands.Liu Yu Tong looked at Ling Han. After seeing the smile plastered all over Ling Han's face, she then slowly reached towards her veil and calmly took it off.In an instant, it was as if their whole surroundings lit up.How could there be such a beautiful girl in this world?What an outstanding beauty... how devastatingly beautiful! Though her demeanor was as cold as an iceberg, it caused one to have an even stronger desire to conquer her. To be able to have this beauty become a charming pet at his knee, what sense of accomplishment would that be?Liu Dong and the rest were amazed to the point of losing their breath first, but then immediately felt pity, for this kind of outstanding beauty was about to fall into the hands of Hang Zhan.Hang Zhan naturally was extremely surprised and joyous. He had never imagined that he would actually encounter such a beauty; his eyes were wide to the point that they seemed as if they were about to pop out. He laughed loudly and said, \"Beauty, come here!\"\"Be careful, Young Master, she's in the Element Gathering Tier!\" Elder Yu suddenly spoke up, his wrinkled face filled with utmost seriousness.He could not tell this woman's actual power!It was possible to see the cultivation level of someone with lower cultivation than oneself, but this required both parties to be at a close enough distance. Just like Elder Yu--he was far beneath Liu Yu Tong in power, so he could only identify that Liu Yu Tong's cultivation level had already reached the Element Gathering Tier, but could not tell exactly what her cultivation level was.Liu Dong and his group, as well as Hang Zhan, all experienced a great shock, displaying expressions of complete disbelief.[1] ED/N: Lol I thought they'd be going on about how they couldn't leave the girls behind as the bastard's meal, and they care about arms instead?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 31": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Alchemy Emperor of the Divine DaoCH 31Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis woman could only be eighteen or nineteen years old at most, yet she had already reached Element Gathering Tier?But how was it possible that a strong warrior of Element Gathering Tier would actually spout nonsense?Hang Zhan was shocked for a moment, before quickly giving a \"humph\" in his heart--so what if she was at Element Gathering Tier? At this age, she could only have just broken through, how would it be possible that she could oppose Elder Yu?\"Elder Yu, take her down!\" The lust in Hang Zhan's heart was fully active. Being a cultivator in the Body Refining Tier, to be able to hold down a master in the Element Gathering Tier underneath his body and toy with her, his sense of fulfillment would be overwhelmingly strong--particularly when this girl was of such exquisite beauty.He was very close to being unable to hold himself back.Although Elder Yu had a cautious expression on his face, he too did not think of Liu Yu Tong as a powerful enemy. After all, the girl was much too young. According to his mindset, the girl may be in the first or second layer in Element Gathering Tier... maybe the third layer, at most.He was someone in the ninth layer of Element Gathering Tier. Although it was not possible for him to break through to the Gushing Spring Tier in this lifetime, but on the plane of Element Gathering Tier, he found few who could actually battle against him on even footing.\"Young miss, surrender obediently to avoid suffering later,\" he spoke up.Killing intent flashed through Liu Yu Tong's eyes. She was the princess of the Liu Clan. In front of the Eight Great Clans of the Imperial City, what did a mere Stone Wolf Sect count as? This Hang Zhan actually dared to bear evil intentions towards her, it seemed like he really was seeking death.But when her current position came to mind, she could not help turning to look at Ling Han, a questioning look on her face.Ling Han gave a shrug, and said, \"This kind of bastard, if you want to kill him, then go ahead.\"Liu Yu Tong turned back around, and the powerful aura of the ninth layer of Element Gathering Tier was released without any reservations-- it rivaled Elder Yu's aura, and showed no signs of losing.\"What!\" Elder Yu quickly paled, breathing out in shock, \"Ninth layer of Element Gathering Tier, how is this possible!\"Ninth layer of Element Gathering Tier?Elder Yu was not the only one to be greatly shocked. Even Liu Dong and his group were flabbergasted, their facial muscles twitching in shock.Let alone reaching the ninth layer of Element Gathering Tier, for someone below twenty years old to achieve Element Gathering Tier was already shocking enough! Liu Dong and his friends had originally thought that even if there was a gap between themselves and Liu Yu Tong, this gap wouldn't be too far, because they too had already achieved the eighth and ninth layers of Body Refining Tier respectively and so were only one step away from breaking through to Element Gathering Tier.But the ninth layer of Element Gathering Tier.... that was a kind of power they only dared to ponder about as something they would only be able to face at least eight, or maybe even ten years later.Elder Yu immediately clasped his fists in a polite gesture, and said, \"Please excuse my Young Master's previous impoliteness, Young Miss. I hereby apologize on behalf of my Young Master!\" Although both of them were in the ninth layer of Element Gathering Tier and he thought that he would not lose against this young woman, the problem was that his opponent had already reached the ninth layer of Element Gathering Tier at such a young age, and this was not something that could be done with the support of any ordinary party.In other words, it was her background Elder Yu was scared of.Although Hang Zhan felt upset, and was unwilling to give up, there was nothing he could do. Even if he was an extremely haughty, arrogant man, he wasn't an idiot. He knew that there were some people that he could trifle with, and there were some people that he definitely should not even think of messing with.Liu Yu Tong belonged to the category of those he definitely should not even think of messing with.Liu Yu Tong only gave a wave of her hands, and said stiffly, \"I won't kill you, get out of my way!\"What a joke, how could anyone think of committing blasphemy against the princess of the Liu Clan and live!\"Miss, don't go too far!\" Elder Yu said in a deep voice. Naturally, he would not just stand aside and watch Hang Zhan die.Liu Yu Tong did not answer. She raised her hands in an offensive stance.Yellow Grade high level martial arts skill, Snapping of the Plum Hands.Seeing this, Elder Yu knew that this matter could not be peacefully settled, so raised his hands as well, forming claws.\"Yellow Grade medium level martial arts skill, Flying Eagle Claws!\" Liu Dong declared. He was best at claw skills, and so knew the characteristics of many different skills belonging to that class. With one glance, he managed to identify Elder Yu's claw skill.\"Ling Han, will that one from your family have any problems?\" The five of them had already gathered around Ling Han. Liu Yu Tong was now their only ray of hope.Ling Han smiled softly, and said, \"She should not.\"Should not?Liu Dong and his companions were all unsettled. \"Should not\" sounded very dubious, but both of the fighters were in the ninth layer of Element Gathering Tier, so really, who could actually say with certainty which one of them would emerge victorious?While they had been conversing, Liu Yu Tong had already moved, and was now in a fierce battle with Elder Yu.The two of them exchanged blows, their figures moving like wind--extremely quick.The two fighters were both masters in the ninth layer of Element Gathering Tier. Liu Dong and his group couldn't clearly see their movements or judge the actual situation. They only felt the blurring of their sight, and had completely no idea who was winning.Hang Zhan naturally couldn't see clearly either. He couldn't help feeling extremely anxious, for if Elder Yu was defeated, he would definitely lose his life as well. So, of course he was worried.But after the battle had lasted for about three to five minutes, the movements of the two fighters had slowed down, not only to the point that Liu Dong and his group could all see very clearly, but also to the point that even they thought that the pace of the battle had become much too slow.However, a hint of prudence appeared on Ling Han's face.Slow did not mean that the two fighters were going easy on their attacks. On the contrary, the situation now was even more dangerous, for they had already entered a life-or-death stage. Should either of the two of them make even a small, tiny mistake, the result would not just be defeat, but death.He recalled that these few days, whenever he was free, he would be guiding Liu Yu Tong. Based on his previous cultivation of Heaven Tier, whatever little bit of experience he managed to pass on to a lower level martial artist would be extremely precious. As long as she had truly absorbed his teachings, there would definitely be a monumental increase in her power.With Liu Yu Tong's level of comprehension, he believed that she should have understood much of what he had been teaching her.This battle... she should be able to win.Liu Yu Tong and Elder Yu's battle slowed down even further. One of them was an old master in the Element Gathering Tier who had been at this stage for a very long time, and thus had extremely vast battle experience. Meanwhile, though the other was young, she was a martial arts genius and had a very high level of comprehension. Moreover, she had also benefited much from Ling Han's guidance, and was shockingly powerful in battle.Elder Yu's forehead was already heavily beaded with cold sweat. His opponent was too strong. He felt the oncoming pressure of death, but he dared not be distracted at this moment, not even to surrender and beg for mercy. If he dared pause, he would definitely suffer Liu Yu Tong's wrathful strike.Liu Yu Tong, on the other hand, was becoming more and more serene. She was already completely on the winning side.The situation was now extremely clear. Even Liu Dong and his group could see clearly that Liu Yu Tong was winning, so they smiled for they saw their worries dissipate. Since they could see clearly, Hang Zhan naturally could see clearly too. He could not help stepping back and retreating, preparing to escape at the first opportunity.\"You're in such a rush, where are you headed to?\" Ling Han flew forwards like an arrow shot from a bow, blocking his way.\"Get out of my way!\" Hang Zhan shouted loudly, \"I'm from the Stone Wolf Sect, and you dare to trifle with me? I'll slaughter your whole family!\"How overbearing!Ling Han drew his sword, his gaze filled with murderous intent. There was nothing worth saying to such a man--the best thing would be to immediately kill him.\"Ling Han, don't be impulsive!\" Liu Dong could not help shouting out. Should Hang Zhan be killed, none of their clans would be able to withstand the furious rage of the Stone Wolf Sect.\"Haha, listen to your companion's advise, and never oppose me! Otherwise, nothing but death awaits you!\" Hang Zhan laughed coldly, \"You're fortunate today!\" He was just about ready to run away and escape.However, he had not yet managed to move from his place when he felt a cool sensation on his neck--a long sword was already pressed against it, immediately causing his whole body to shiver. He felt as if he was almost going to urinate out of fear.\"There is no one that I dare not kill!\" Ling Han said calmly, and his voice turned cold, \"Kneel!\"Hang Zhan did not dare refuse. The freezing cold eyes of the man in front of him caused him to feel a cutting chill. This was clearly a man of his word.\"Apologize!\" Ling Han continued to say.Hang Zhan immediately felt the urge to stand up and spit out curses, but as he felt the freezing sensation upon his neck, he could only bow his head while thinking that as soon as he got back to the Stone Wolf Sect, he would definitely have his grandfather personally come to kill all these guys in front of him!Of course, the two beautiful girls would be spared and become his toys instead.\"I was wrong, I'm inhumane!\" He said, begging for mercy.\"I hope you will become a good person in your next life,\" Ling Han said coolly.\"No-\" Hang Zhan immediately sensed the situation was taking a turn for the worse, but he only felt a sharp pain on his neck as his sight suddenly turned dark. Fresh blood spurted out, causing his eyes to go wide in disbelief--Ling Han actually dared to kill him!At the same moment, Liu Yu Tong gave a soft cry--with a pat of her small hands, it was as if Elder Yu had turned into stone, showing no signs of movement at all. After a long while, his body finally collapsed onto the ground.\"This is going to be a huge catastrophe!\" Liu Dong and the rest sighed in unison.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 32": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Alchemy Emperor of the Divine DaoCH 32Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLing Han withdrew his sword and said, smiling, \"Will you tell anyone of what has happened here today?\"\"Of course not!\" Liu Dong and the rest quickly shook their heads.\"It's all right, then. None of us present here will say anything, so who would find out that Hang Zhan and his lackey died here?\" Ling Han said.However, Liu Dong and his companions were still unable to let go of their worries. After all, the name of \"Stone Wolf Sect\" was much too intimidating; based on its power, the sect could easily eliminate their respective clans a hundred times. With such feelings, they dared not linger here for too long, fearing that Ling Han would kill them too to ensure their silence. Moreover, they each possessed a Green Spiritual Fruit in their hands, adding on to the unsettled feelings in their hearts.They soon bid farewell to Ling Han and set off, quickly disappearing from his sight.Killing the eyewitnesses... Ling Han naturally had no such plan, for his little female attendant was the princess of the Liu Clan of the Imperial City. Against such a noble existence, what did an insignificant Hang Zhan count as? If the Stone Wolf Sect found out that Hang Zhan actually dared to bear evil intentions towards Liu Yu Tong, they might even personally behead Hang Zhan as an apology.Just as how Liu Dong and his group felt immeasurable fear towards Stone Wolf Sect, what did an insignificant Stone Wolf Sect count as in the eyes of the Eight Great Clans?'I'll take one Green Spiritual Fruit first. Once I reach the peak of the ninth layer of Body Refining Tier, I'll take the second one,' Ling Han thought. Although he had already walked through all the nine tiers on his way from the Body Refining Tier all the way to the Heaven Tier, this did not imply that he could easily step over the gulf between the two tiers.That was because, aside from the comprehension and understanding accumulated within a given tier, breaking through the bottlenecks between tiers was an endeavor that required a vast amount of energy to support it.Where did this energy came from?Spiritual medicine, alchemical pills, treasures obtained from demonic beasts, spiritual fluids found in nature could all be used as the source of this energy. Unfortunately, these materials were extremely rare and hard to find.This was the reason why the higher the tier, the fewer martial artists there were that could achieve it. Without these kinds of supporting materials to provide the additional energy for martial artists to break through to a higher tier, the only thing they could do was depend on themselves to slowly accumulate the energy required for the breakthrough. Some would be able to succeed in breaking through, while some may cause themselves to explode from over-accumulation of energy.If he had not had the Green Spiritual Fruit, Ling Han may have needed to accumulate about ten plus days worth of Origin Power to reach the peak of the ninth layer of Body Refining Tier, and then break through to the Element Gathering Tier in a spurt of energy. But things were different now. When he reached the barrier between Body Refining and Element Gathering Tier, Ling Han only needed to take the Green Spiritual Fruit, and it would be smooth sailing all the way.Ling Han liberated all the valuables from the bodies of Hang Zhan and Elder Yu. Because the two of them had been on a journey, they obviously had not kept too many valuables on them, so all he managed to find were some money and a book on some secret martial art.The sum of money came up to a total of about one hundred thousand coins, which could not be considered a small sum. Meanwhile, the book was titled \"Detonation Arts\", and it was a rather unique skill. Basically, it allowed a martial artist to inject his Origin Power into something which would cause the item to detonate. It would be difficult for someone to defend against such a skill.Elder Yu should have just obtained this secret arts manual and had yet to start mastering it. Otherwise, if Liu Yu Tong had been surprised with such an attack in the midst of battle, then she would definitely have suffered quite a bit.The two of them moved to a new location. After all, there were two dead bodies in their previous location; just looking at the two corpses would spoil their mood.Ling Han sat down in a cross-legged position. He then took out a Green Spiritual Fruit and washed it with a bit of clean water. Then, he quickly consumed it in large bites.It really did deserve the name of a Spiritual Fruit born from nature. Even though its level couldn't really be considered high, it was still extremely delicious and, within a few bites, Ling Han had already finished eating it. He felt extremely dissatisfied, and really wanted to take out the other fruit and eat it too.He quickly suppressed this impulsive urge, and quietly waited for the medicinal effects to play out.In but a short moment, a powerful and intense medicinal effect was released, transforming into innumerable tiny particles, entering his bloodstream and spreading throughout his entire body.Ling Han circulated Five Elements Heaven Grade Skill. The Spirit Base in his Dantian gave out a shimmering light like a lotus flower of the Dao, guiding the medicinal effects to nourish every piece of flesh, every bone, and every vein in his body.His cultivation rate was already very fast to begin with. Before he had consumed the Green Spiritual Fruit, he had already reached the middle period of the seventh layer. Now that he had obtained the support of the Spiritual Fruit, his progression rate was naturally even more terrifying.The late period of the seventh layer of the Body Refining Tier... the peak of the seventh layer of Body Refining Tier!He accumulated some Origin Power and, in one breath, broke through to the eighth layer of Body Refining Tier. At this time, the medicinal effects of the Green Spiritual Fruit had not been completely exhausted yet, and were still continuously improving his cultivation. They were finally exhausted once Ling Han made it to the middle period of the eighth layer of Body Refining Tier.'Very good, it saved me about six days' worth of time.'Watching all this, a strange thought rose up in Liu Yu Tong's heart--it was the first time that she had not been shocked by the quick ascent of Ling Han's cultivation level. After all, this time should be considered normal, as he had eaten a Green Spiritual Fruit.The two of them continued journeying around the mountain. Ling Han continued to refine his sword skills, hoping to achieve three flashes of Sword Qi before he broke through to the Element Gathering Tier.After another eight days, Ling Han had reached the peak of the eighth layer of Body Refining Tier. After storing up one night's worth of Origin Power, he began the process of breaking through to the ninth layer of Body Refining Tier. By the time morning came and the sun had risen, he stood up, the corners of his lips lifting slightly upwards in a smile.The ninth layer of Body Refining Tier.'Very good, I need around another ten days' time and I will reach the peak of the ninth layer of Body Refining Tier. At that time, I will consume the second Green Spiritual Fruit, and in one breath break through to the Element Gathering Tier!'Liu Yu Tong was naturally already numbed. Should Ling Han be able to break through to the Element Gathering Tier on the morrow, she might very well not feel surprised. Otherwise, if she still became shocked every time this guy did something surprising, she really might die an early death.Ten days passed very quickly and Ling Han, as per his expectations, had already reached the peak of the ninth layer of Body Refining Tier.He took out the second Green Spiritual Fruit, and smiled, saying, \"Today is my last day in Body Refining Tier... ai, it really has been a very long time!\"Liu Yu Tong could not help rolling her eyes in response. She had been by Ling Han's side since the time when he was only in the second layer of Body Refining Tier. How many days had it been? Just one month! This was \"a very long time\" he was talking of! But when she recalled how Ling Han had been stagnant for a number of years in the second layer of Body Refining Tier previously, his rueful feeling could be considered quite logical.She started cultivation when she was thirteen, and achieved the Element Gathering Tier when she was fourteen. This point alone did make it seem that her cultivation progress had been much faster when compared with Ling Han's.After Ling Han swallowed the Green Spiritual Fruit, he started to break through to the Element Gathering Tier.He did not rush it. Instead, he only started to gather the medicinal effects within his body.Usually, when a martial artist began the process of breaking through, even if they had the support of medicinal effects, they had to batter against the barrier repeatedly until it had somewhat loosened to be able to breach it. However, Ling Han had absolute confidence that as long as he had stored up enough energy, he'd be able to successfully break through this barrier on his first attempt.Half an hour later, his body was brimming with Origin Power, and he felt as if his whole body was inflated.This was of course but a misconception. It was just that he had stored too much energy within his body, causing him to have this kind of an \"inflated\" feeling. But should he still not break through or unleash this energy somehow, his body really might explode because of this accumulation of energy.It was like a water pouch that had already been filled to the brim. If the pouch was not punctured to make a hole to release some water, or if the water wasn't transferred to a bigger pouch, then the only result would be that the pouch would explode.'It's about enough,' Ling Han thought. 'Now all that's left is to guide this boundless energy towards the Dantian and batter against the barrier.'Body Refining Tier meant to store Origin Power in every bit of blood and flesh, and so it was actually very limited in quantity. As for Element Gathering Tier, it meant to open up one's Dantian, and form a strange space within one's body.Everyone possessed this kind of a small universe, or a small world, in their bodies. In terms of martial arts, this kind of small world was thought to exist within one's Dantian.\"Hong!\"Under the fierce barrage of energy, a slit-like hole appeared in his Dantian. For anyone else to break through, they would have to depend on a continuous, repeated barrage to endlessly widen and enlarge this hole or slit. However, Ling Han was different. The energy he had accumulated was more than enough for him to immediately begin breaking through.Opening up the Dantian was only the first step. The next step was the most important one.That was, to solidify the Origin Power into a high-speed revolving nucleus.This was something like installing a motor in one's Dantian. With a mental command, the origin nucleus revolving at high speeds would generate energy that would erupt with a horrifying attack.How was it that the Element Gathering Tier could easily crush the Body Refining Tier? That was because once the origin nucleus was formed, energy would gush out like a flood from it. Even if two fighters had accumulated equal amounts of Origin Power, the one who had actually formed the origin nucleus would have faster, stronger attacks, possessing an overwhelming advantage over his opponent.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 33": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Alchemy Emperor of the Divine DaoCH 33Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLing Han's opening up his Dantian could only be considered as being halfway to Element Gathering Tier. He had only raised the upper limit of his internal storage of Origin Power--the power upgrade depended on whether he could form the origin nucleus or not.The number of those in the ninth layer of Body Refining Tier who had been stuck on this step is unknown, but definitely very big.Martial artists of the Element Gathering Tier could form a total of nine origin nuclei. Once they had succeeded in forming the ninth, they'd be able to start the process of breaking through to the Gushing Spring Tier.However, for Ling Han, forming an origin nucleus was only a small issue. After all, he had already done it nine times in his last life.He started to form the nucleus. The powerful Origin Power stirred, gathered, intertwined and melded together. He was very familiar with this process and, very quickly, the Origin Power within his body solidified into a nucleus form, as tiny as a hair's breadth.But, he immediately experienced a great shock, for within his Dantian, there actually appeared five origin nuclei!How was this possible!He had only just broken through to Element Gathering Tier, and now he had already reached the fifth layer of Element Gathering Tier?No, no, no... this was an impossible thing, because these five origin nuclei were much too small, and were still very far from reaching their pinnacle--he had never heard that anyone had ever managed to form five origin nuclei in one go and simultaneously expand them to their pinnacle form.Additionally, the gaps between these five origin nuclei was much too small. They had a mutual attraction and repulsion relationship, forming a subtle balance. They were also differently colored--gold, green, white, red and black, respectively.Ling Han's heart skipped a beat. These were the solid forms of the five different elemental alignments. These five nuclei represented Gold, Wood, Water, Fire and Earth, respectively.Could it be that a Spirit Base with multiple elemental alignments could form multiple origin nuclei?But how was it possible that he had never heard of such a thing in his last life?'That's not right!'Ling Han carefully examined them and concluded that these five different origin nuclei had achieved a perfect balance. Should any of these five nuclei be even a little bit stronger, it would destroy that delicate balance. Thus, there would only be one origin nucleus, the strongest, that could 'survive\" in the end, while the other origin nuclei would be pushed aside and shatter.Following this line of deduction, for someone to be able to form two, three, four, or the maximum of five origin nuclei, the elemental alignments of their Spirit Base had to achieve a perfect balance. This would allow the origin nuclei that had been formed to also be perfectly balanced with one another, none of which would be able to swallow the others and vice versa.There were many in this world who possessed two elemental alignments, or even three or four. But those who had multiple elemental alignments and actually managed to achieve a perfectly balanced relationship between the multiple elemental alignments in his Spirit Base were few and far between. Thus, it was a pitiful few that could actually possess two or three origin nuclei.In his last life, besides burying himself in alchemy, Ling Han had also buried himself in cultivation. He took part in very few actual battles, and so not coming into contact with martial artists that had multiple origin nuclei was nothing strange. Moreover, multiple origin nuclei could become anyone's hidden trump card to turn over the tables and obtain victory, and who would reveal their trump card easily?'The five origin nuclei would combine together to form a large origin nucleus, which means that I will have Origin Power five times stronger than anyone else!' Ling Han thought. This was something very terrifying.For a martial artist to completely exhaust the Origin Power within his body, they'd need at least hundred plus moves, or even thousand plus moves. But should he be able to discharge this energy at five times the speed?This would mean that the power of every attack would be increased by five times!If the power of Element Gathering Tier was shown with numbers, the first layer would be 'one', then the second layer would be 'two' and the third layer would be 'three', but the fourth layer would be 'six'. There would be a leap after every three layers, separating the entire tier into the three major stages: early, middle and late, respectively.With this kind of representation, the advantage of Five Elements origin nuclei was obviously without compare.'No, no, no, the Five Element Origin Nuclei have also achieved a perfect balance as they are mutually interdependent, thus the power they can generate would definitely not be just five, but six times, or even ten times stronger! Should I reach the peak of the first layer of Element Gathering Tier, I'd at least be able to fight on equal footing with someone in the fourth layer of Element Gathering Tier!How much power would I actually have... I'll have to reach the peak of the first layer of Element Gathering Tier to find out.'So this was the true power of an Immortal Grade Spirit Base!However, to simultaneously expand and strengthen five origin nuclei would definitely be much slower than expanding just one, so the advantage of cultivation speed of an Immortal Grade Spirit Base was thus evened out. Moreover, to be able to discharge Origin Power at five times the speed would require for the space within his Dantian to be simply colossal. Otherwise, he would only have the opportunity to make a few moves before exhausting all of the energy stored in his body, so how could he continue to play like this?'Never mind if there's no advantage of fast cultivation speed. After all, I would obtain power that would make me practically invincible amongst all those within the same cultivation level in exchange for it. Moreover, I am the Alchemy Emperor, so I'll still be able to maintain a high speed of cultivation and progress through the tiers. Even if I can only reach Heaven Tier by two hundred years old again, that'd still be the fastest record in history!No, no, no, I already have a complete understanding and comprehension of the different tiers, so I definitely would not need as long as two hundred years to break through to Heaven Tier.The world is fair. To be able to obtain stronger power, one must make twice, or even ten times the sacrifice. Moreover, the space within my Dantian is still too small, so I still do not have the ability to battle for too long.According to my understanding, only those Spirit Bases that have multiple elemental alignments that are also perfectly balanced can be labeled as an Immortal Grade Spirit Base. However, Immortal Grade Spirit Bases can also be separated into various categories, and my Five Elements Mix Chaos Lotus is the strongest!That's because there cannot be a Spirit Base with six elemental alignments in this world, as it would then be impossible to achieve a balance between the various elemental alignments.No wonder I had a strange feeling when I previously read the second layer of this Five Elements Heaven Grade Skill. I had initially thought that the creator of this skill arts had made some kind of a mistake, but now it seems that this is because the Five Elements Mix Chaos Lotus is able to form Five Elements Origin Nuclei. If it's the simultaneous circulation of the five origin nuclei, there are no problems with this skill arts.So, it seems that an Immortal Grade Spirit Base definitely needs a specific kind of skill arts to be able to release its full prowess. Otherwise, if I were to use an ordinary skill arts to stimulate the Five Elements Origin Nuclei... I really have no idea what would happen.It seems that in this life, all my conditions are the best. If I still can't shatter the void and become a god with all those advantages, then I really should find a piece of tofu and knock myself to death with it.Taking advantage of the fact that the medicinal effects have not been completely exhausted, I'll cultivate for a while longer.'Ling Han guided the remnants of the medicinal effects from the Green Spiritual Fruit to expand his Dantian and strengthen his origin nuclei.The cultivation process of Element Gathering Tier was to expand one's Dantian and strengthen the origin nucleus as much as possible.The larger the Dantian, the more Origin Power it could store and accumulate. Meanwhile, the larger the origin nucleus and the faster its rotation, the stronger the power that could instantly erupt from it would be. Thus, even if two martial artists possessed the same cultivation levels, there would still appear a large gap between their individual battle prowess.Of course, the number of origin nuclei also had to be taken into consideration now.Ling Han was like an excavator, enlarging his Dantian to enable it to store even more Origin Power and stimulating the rotation of his origin nuclei at the same time. With every rotation, the speed would increase by just at little bit more, and as strands of Origin Power twined around the origin nuclei, the origin nuclei would also become larger in size.He had to be very cautious when strengthening the origin nuclei in his Dantian, because there needed to be an absolute balance amongst the five origin nuclei. Otherwise, if there was even the slightest bit of difference, this balance would collapse. The earlier the stage, the more there could not be any minuscule bit of difference, for the foundation was still much too weak.Because of his thirst for power, Ling Han diligently continued to cultivate with utmost concentration.'What?!'While he had been energetically \"excavating\", he suddenly stopped, and an inconceivable expression appeared on his face.A black tower was drifting within his Dantian, exuding a golden light that stirred slightly. It gave off a desolate, primitive air, ancient and dignified. There were nine levels in this tower, and from the angle of Ling Han's mind's sight, this black tower had a height of ten thousand metres, connecting the heavens and the earth.Even though it had already been ten thousand years, Ling Han could still identify this black tower with one glance. In his words, even if this tower had been burnt to ashes, he'd still be able to identify it! Because, this black tower was the culprit that had \"killed\" him in his last life!Curses, how could this tower be inside his Dantian? Could it be that killing him once in his last life was not enough so it had chased after him to this second life, planning to kill him a second time?You can't play the game like that!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There was a golden script engraved on the walls of the tower, which was the Indestructible Heaven Scroll.That had been Ling Han's biggest opportunity, yet it was also the largest crisis in his last life. With a shake of the black tower, his physical body was directly shattered into ashes--for some reason, his soul had survived and passed through ten thousand years into the current time period.Now looking upon this black tower, even with his strong mentality of a warrior of Heaven Tier, he still could not help but feel scared for a moment.In his last life, this black tower had only shook a little, and he was shattered into ashes. Now that it had reappeared within his body, how could this not be terrifying?However, Ling Han very quickly regained his composure.If the black tower intended to kill him a second time, then it could have done so long ago--although he had only just discovered the existence of the black tower within his Dantian, this thing should have actually been there for a very long time.And now that he thought about it carefully, this might clear away some of the confusion that he had.For example, why was it that his soul had existed for about ten thousand years?It must have been because of the black tower!The reason for his sudden rebirth must also be related to the black tower using some kind of unknown method to allow him to be reborn. The black tower also conveniently followed him into this new life.\"Brother, should I thank you, or hate you? Huh?\" Ling Han murmured.Because of the black tower, his last life was ended prematurely, but to be honest, even if he had not been shattered to death by the black tower, with a short thousand years' time, how would he be able to learn the Indestructible Heaven Scroll?It was completely impossible.Because even when he had neither eaten nor slept, spending all his time on his studies of the Indestructible Heaven Scroll, he still needed to spend ten thousand years' time. If it was under normal conditions, how would he be able to accomplish that?Now, he even had a feeling that the black tower had actually shattered him into ashes to help him and allow him to comprehend the Indestructible Heaven Scroll in soul form, thus he was reborn the moment he had finally grasped the Heaven Scroll's first layer.Otherwise, how could there be such a huge coincidence in this world?The black tower, as it had been in the past, still possessed nine floors, and aside from the lowest floor having a tightly closed door, the other floors were all completely sealed, without a single window or any other entrance. Even with Ling Han's sight, he still could not identify the material used to construct this black tower. All he could sense from it was an icy, weathered, ancient air.Additionally, Ling Han had never heard that the Dantian could accommodate anything else other than Origin Power!This black tower was definitely not of this world!There was a ninety-nine percent chance that the black tower originated from the divine plane, and so did the Indestructible Heaven Scroll engraved on its walls--a cultivation technique that required ten thousand years to be comprehended naturally could not possibly belong to this mortal plane either.Ling Han wanted to use his consciousness to enter the black tower, but discovered it was impossible. Even if consciousness was a power without form, and thus should be able to find its way anywhere, there was not even a small pinhole in this black tower through which his mental consciousness could enter.He wanted to force his way through the door, but when he directed his mental consciousness to rush towards the door, it was immediately rebounded back.Fine, this was a master.In his last life, it erased his existence with a casual tremor, and now, its overbearing presence was occupying his Dantian while he not only couldn't do anything to it, but also had completely no idea what kind of existence this black tower actually was.He was unwilling to give up, and once again commanded his consciousness to attack the black tower. No matter what, he had to find something out.After a few times of barraging his mental powers over and over against the tower, it seemed like the black tower had somewhat lost patience with him. It actually gave a slight tremor. There was finally a reaction, and a flash of consciousness was transmitted out by the black tower.This exceeded the level of simple language, and allowed Ling Han to directly understand its meaning. The general idea transmitted by the black tower was \"the current you is still too weak, and cannot possibly enter the black tower. You'd have to at least break through to the Gushing Spring Tier. But as the new master of the black tower, every time you progress to the next tier, you'll be able to obtain a single blessing from the black tower to directly raise your power by one tier.\"For example, as per Ling Han's current cultivation level of the early period of the first layer of Element Gathering Tier, with the blessing of the black tower, he'd be able to display the power of someone in the first layer of Gushing Spring Tier. However, it was only a one-time blessing. Even if he didn't use it, it'd be wasted, and couldn't be accumulated.Master? He had actually become the master of the black tower?!However, this black tower really was a master. After all, if he was its master, why was it that he could not make use of it at all? Moreover, for every tier he ascended to, he could only get a one-time blessing from the black tower. Looks like he'd have to break through to the Gushing Spring Tier to be able to find out more. [1]Still, this could become his trump card--to instantly raise his power by one tier, this trump card was more than enough to let him turn the tables in a moment of danger!But, he could only use this kind of trump card once every time he ascended to the next tier... the tower was really much too stingy!Ling Han could not help exhaling a sigh before opening his eyes, looking very sullen.Liu Yu Tong almost felt like crying at this. You managed to break through to the Element Gathering Tier in one day, and yet you still look so disappointed. How could this be endured by others?\"Come on, let's go home!\" Ling Han gave a snap of his fingers.This was the first time he had experienced the warmth of a father's love, and now that he has been away from home for close to a month, he felt a bit homesick.The two of them then began their journey home. On the way, Ling Han went through the second layer of cultivation techniques of the Five Elements Heaven Grade Skill inside his head. With his high perception, naturally he experienced no trouble and fully grasped every little detail of the second layer.There were nine layers in total in the Five Elements Heaven Grade Skill, corresponding with a martial artist's cultivation level from Body Refining Tier all the way to Heaven Tier. Every breakthrough would mean that there should be a change to the corresponding cultivation technique suited to that cultivation level. [ED/N: As in, he has to cultivate in the next layer whenever he reaches the next tier]Element Gathering Tier was indeed something else.Origin Power gushed out from his Dantian. The amount was at least ten times that of the ninth layer of Body Refining Tier. Origin Power continuously flooded out from his Dantian as if there was no end to it.When they had departed, they had spent about less than half a day's time to arrive at their destination, but their return journey only lasted about an hour.Very soon, Gray Cloud Town appeared in front of their eyes.\"Greetings, Young Master Han!\"\"Greetings, Young Master Han!\"From the moment they stepped into the Ling Clan Residence, all servants and guards greeted Ling Han respectfully. Everyone now knew that Ling Han had defeated the Cheng brothers, and thus naturally would not dare to be disrespectful to this Young Master previously well-known as Trash anymore.After asking around, Ling Han found out that his father was currently inside his study, and quickly ran there.Ling Dong Xing had said before that as long as he managed to break through to the Element Gathering Tier, he would tell him what had happened to his mother.He entered the yard, and soon arrived at the door to the study. The door was ajar, and he gave a soft cough before entering, and said, \"Father, I've returned.\"\"Haha, you returned just in time. Tonight, the Cheng Clan is hosting a banquet, and your name is also on the invitation,\" Ling Dong Xing gave a hearty laugh, raising his head to look at Ling Han while holding out an invitation.Ling Han took the invitation, scanned through it, then said with a smile, \"The Cheng Clan can't hold on any longer?\"Ling Dong Xing had long started his counterattack against the Cheng Clan.When Ma Da Jun cut off the supply of alchemical medicine to the Cheng Clan, the Cheng Clan was like a normal human being who had lost a leg--their every step was a trial. Additionally, the Ling Clan was also attacking the other business ventures of the Cheng Clan--paying a high price to purchase the medicinal ingredients that were supposed to be sold to the Cheng Clan and selling them at low prices.In this manner, the finances of the Cheng Clan were completely paralyzed, just as how the finances of the Ling Clan had been.Twenty plus days of this, and the Cheng Clan was now trapped in a big dilemma.At this time, the Cheng Clan actually sent them an invitation to a banquet they were hosting. This was most likely a plea for mercy.\"Later, the two of us will attend the banquet. But be careful, and don't run around at the banquet. I'm worried that the Cheng Clan may be desperate enough to set up a trap,\" Ling Dong Xing said. He would, of course, not brave the danger alone. The elite members of the clan would also be attending along him to act as a deterrence in case the Cheng Clan was thinking of committing violence.Ling Dong Xing looked at Ling Han, slightly frowning. He felt as if something was not right, but exactly what that something was, he could not think of.\"Pa!\"After half a moment, he suddenly smacked the table, and jumped up from his seat, his whole face filled with excitement, and said, \"Han'er, you... you've broken through to Element Gathering Tier!\" He finally discovered what that weird feeling he had was.Ling Han nodded, and said with a smile, \"I have.\"\"Good! Good! Good!\" Ling Dong Xing looked very excited, his hands clenched into fists. Because he had exerted too much strength into it, the bones in his fingers made a grinding sound, and the veins on his hands were protruding.\"Father, I want to know about Mother!\" Ling Han said deeply.Ling Dong Xing was hesitant for a while, before nodding his head and saying, \"The current you does have the right to know. I had originally thought that the matter about your mother would be hidden in my heart for the rest of my life. I've hidden it for too long, so long that my heart is also very bitter!\"Ling Han nodded lightly. All these years, Ling Dong Xing had borne the pain of losing his beloved wife alone. There was no one to comfort him, nor was there anyone to shoulder this pain with him, so he naturally suffered a lot.Ling Han swore in his heart that no matter who it was that had forced his parents to separate, he would ensure that this culprit would pay the price for this crime![1] ED/N: The two words \"master\" used here are different. When it refers to the tower, it means a badass super uber powerful dude (MC said brother earlier so I assume male gender here), and when it refers to MC, it means master as in owner, lord etc. Making it clear just in case.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I was in the prime of my youth, filled with longing for the outside world. After I broke through to the Element Gathering Tier, I left my home to find my own way in the world. Eighteen years ago, I was searching for an antique relic in Dark Demon Forest, when I accidentally encountered your mother.\"As Ling Dong Xing thought back to his past, his steadfast face could not help revealing a sliver of tenderness, especially when he started to speak of Ling Han's mother.\"Your mother's name is Yue Hong Chang. She was a very beautiful and very gentle woman.\"Ling Dong Xing spoke in a murmur, and his gaze became extremely gentle.\"However, the first time we met, we had a slight misunderstanding, and ended up fighting with each other.After that, we started journeying together, and built up a strong, deep affection for one another.When your mother was pregnant with you, we decided to return to Gray Cloud Town, and at that moment, I found out that your mother came from a remarkable background. She was the great granddaughter of the Third Elder of Winter Moon Sect.The Sect Master of Winter Moon Sect was a powerful warrior of the pinnacle of Spiritual Infant Tier, the elders were all in the Spiritual Infant Tier as well. Should any one of them appear, they would be able to easily obliterate our Rain Country!Your mother's elders intended to marry her off to the descendant of another Elder of the Sect, a man named Ao Feng. He was extremely talented in martial arts--so talented that his talent could be claimed to be in defiance of the natural order. However, he was a philandering character. There were hundreds of women around him, and he even had many sons and daughters born out of wedlock.Your mother naturally did not wish to marry such a man, so she left home to get away from her worries, after which she met me, got to know me, and entered into a relationship with me.But eventually, the Winter Moon Sect still discovered your mother's relationship with me, and dispatched elite warriors to capture us. We kept fleeing, and a short while after you were born, your mother's older brother, Yue Zhen Shan, and Ao Feng managed to catch up to us.I will never forget what Ao Feng did to me at that time. He broke all my fingers one by one in order to force me to say traitorous words about your mother. However, he was disappointed. Even if I die, how could I ever do anything to hurt Hong Chang?Your mother threatened them by saying that she would end her own life, and with that, managed to guarantee the safety of us father and son, but my Spirit Base was crippled by Ao Feng.At first, I was of a mind to storm to the Winter Moon Sect and battle to the death, but for your sake, I decided to live out a contemptible life, and so returned to Gray Cloud Town.\"Ling Han suddenly understood. No wonder Ling Dong Xing could easily enter and leave the Purple Light Ground Valley which even elite warriors from Hu Yang Academy did not manage to enter. His mother must have left some kind of secret treasure with his father that could ensure his survival years ago.Spiritual Infant Tier!Ling Han lightly frowned. It looks like he would not be able to retrieve his mother in the short term. There were ten tiers in martial arts, and the Spiritual Infant Tier was the seventh tier. Meanwhile, he had only just stepped onto the second tier, so no matter how he looked at it, it'd take him about ten, twenty years or even more before he managed to achieve the seventh tier. [1]And this was still what he, with his comprehension of the tiers up to Heaven Tier, an Immortal Grade Spirit Base, a Heaven Grade cultivation technique and the support of his knowledge as the Alchemy Emperor, could achieve. If it was any other genius, even if they managed to enter the Spiritual Infant Tier within their lifetime, it would still be something that could only be possible after at least two or three hundred years' time.He had to make full use of his time!That's because, there was a limit to the lifespan of a martial artist. If a martial artist did not break through to the Flower Blossom Tier, they would enjoy a lifespan no longer than that of a mortal. At best, he would have no pains or illnesses and manage to survive to a hundred years old. But should he be able to break through to Flower Blossom Tier, then he'd be able to gain an extra two hundred years of lifespan, and breaking through to every subsequent tier would reward the martial with another additional two hundred years of lifespan.Ao Feng!Flames of rage burned strongly in Ling Han's eyes. Although Ling Dong Xing had played down what he experienced, Ling Han could imagine how much his father had suffered in the hands of Ao Feng on that day, and how much humiliation he had gone through for all his dignity to be lost.If it was not for his sake, Ling Dong Xing would definitely have stormed the Winter Moon Sect. At worst, he would die.An insult to the father was the same as insulting the son!Ling Han had already sentenced Ao Feng to death penalty within his heart. However, as Ao Feng was a disciple of the Winter Moon Sect, and was even labeled a genius existence, what would his current cultivation level be?Spiritual Ocean? Spiritual Pedestal? Flower Blossom? [2]\"Han'er, although you are very talented, the Winter Moon Sect is still a colossal existence to the two of us. You must not act impulsively. Otherwise, I really will not be able to face your mother anymore!\" Ling Dong Xing said after regaining his composure.Ling Han nodded, and said, \"Please don't worry, Father. I will definitely not act impulsively.\"\"All my hopes are now on your shoulders. You are not only living for the sake of yourself, but also for the sake of your mother!\" Ling Dong Xing said deeply.\"I understand!\"\"Right, now that you have broken through to the Element Gathering Tier, you can participate in the Da Yuan Tournament!\" Ling Dong Xing said, changing the subject.\"Da Yuan Tournament?\" Ling Han searched through the memories in his head, and discovered that he did not have any relevant memories regarding this tournament.Ling Dong Xing smiled, and said, \"You had never shown such talent in the field of martial arts before, and so I never spoke of it to you. This Da Yuan Tournament is a martial arts tournament organized by the Da Yuan King's Mansion. It takes place once every three years. The requirements for the participants are: below thirty years old, cultivation level under Gushing Spring Tier, and being a martial artist that belongs within the sphere of control of Da Yuan City.\"In Rain Country, cities were the largest administrative area, and there were thirty six great cities all over the country. Every city was responsible for an expansive area. Da Yuan City was one of these thirty six cities, and the one in charge of this city was called the Da Yuan King--he was also a descendant of the founding emperor of Rain Country as the title of Da Yuan City's Lord and Da Yuan King was passed down through the generations.Under the control of the Da Yuan King's Mansion were four great powers, which were in charge of their own respective barren areas aside from Da Yuan City itself. Stone Wolf Sect was one of them.\"What kind of reward will the champion get?\" Ling Han asked.Ling Dong Xing could not help feeling a little scorn. His son was really quite ambitious to immediately and directly aim for the position of champion. However, this was his excellent son. He thought for a while, and said, \"It's apparently some kind of spiritual medicine called Dark Moon Grass. It's the chief ingredient for concocting Purple Origin Pill, which can help a martial artist in the Element Gathering Tier easily break through to the Gushing Spring Tier.\"Ling Han was immediately flabbergasted.The alchemists now.... were they all idiots?Dark Moon Grass is of such high value, how could it be used to concoct a Yellow Grade High Level pill?! It was the chief ingredient for concocting the \"Spatial Pill\". The Spatial Pill could help expand the space within the Dantian of a martial artist, and this was something even elite warriors of Heaven Tier would be deeply jealous of!Such a natural spiritual medicine naturally could let a martial artist in the Element Gathering Tier break through easily and successfully to the Gushing Spring Tier. Its grade was so high that it'd be strange if it did not have this kind of effect. But how wasteful was that?The chief ingredient of Purple Origin Pill could be easily replaced with a lower grade medicinal ingredient!Ten thousand years had passed... could it be that there was not even the slightest bit of improvement to alchemy, and alchemy had degraded instead?Ling Han broke out in a smile. He could not allow such a precious spiritual medicine to be wasted, so he could only take the Dark Moon Grass! Moreover, his Five Elements Origin Nuclei expended too much Origin Power at too fast a pace, and he was just worrying about the limited space within his Dantian! And here, the solution came knocking on his door!Still, it was already the end of October now, and there were only about two months left before the end of the year, so it did seem to be a bit pressing.Looks like he would have to make a trip to the Seven Wind Mountains, as the inner core of the Red Scaled Dragon Snake could be used to concoct the \"Transcending Origin Pill\".A Transcending Origin Pill would allow the cultivation level of a martial artist in the Element Gathering Tier to forcibly increase by one layer, but it was only effective for martial artists in the early stage of Element Gathering Tier. For Ling Han, if he wanted to reach the middle stage of Element Gathering Tier before the year's end, then the Transcending Origin Pill was his only option.However, the Red Scaled Dragon Snake was extraordinarily powerful and its whole body was strongly poisonous, thus Ling Han needed to make full preparations for this trip. Otherwise, it would be the same as throwing away his life.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

No matter how extraordinarily gifted you may be, you are still unable to compare with elite warriors in the ninth layer of Element Gathering Tier,\" Ling Dong Xing switched the topic of conversation to advise Ling Han.It's good to have great ambition, but overconfidence was definitely nothing good.Ling Han nodded. Every layer of martial arts was a stage, and every three layers was a large stage. There were very few geniuses that could manage to step over this stage, and defeat those with higher cultivation levels than their own. [1]He was now only in the first layer of Element Gathering Tier, how far was his power from that of the ninth layer of Element Gathering Tier? Moreover, there were some who had broken through to the ninth layer of Element Gathering Tier long ago, and although they had not yet broken through to the Gushing Spring Tier, they could still master their martial arts skills to a higher, stronger level. These warriors would naturally have battle strength that was on a completely different level.If he had reached the peak of the first layer of Element Gathering Tier, then with the power of the Five Elements Origin Nuclei, he'd have a high chance of winning even against someone in the middle stage of Element Gathering Tier. But if his opponent was in the late stage of Element Gathering Tier... the chance of Ling Han winning would only be fifty-fifty.\"After a while, I plan to head to the Seven Wind Mountains for training,\" Ling Han said. Although he had made this decision some time ago, there was still a need to inform Ling Dong Xing of it.Ling Dong Xing was instantly shocked. He naturally knew what kind of place the Seven Wind Mountains was--it was a world where demonic beasts rampaged, and there were extremely fearful creatures within the innermost parts of the forest. Thus, even martial artists in Spiritual Ocean Tier dared not venture too deeply! Ling Han was only in the first layer of Element Gathering Tier, it was too dangerous for him to enter the Seven Wind Mountains.Besides, there were just two months left until the year's end, so even if he went there for a training trip, it wouldn't be possible for him to make much progress anyways.\"Please don't worry, Father. I will only travel around the outer zone, and won't venture too deeply in,\" Ling Han said, smiling. He truly had no such intention, for the martial artist who had discovered the Earth Dragon Grass was also only in the ninth layer of Element Gathering Tier--he too could not have ventured deeply into the Seven Wind Mountains.Still, Ling Dong Xing could not help but worry. However, he also understood that his son was now a grown-up man, so it was impossible that he would listen to his father on every issue. Thus, he had only given him repeated instructions and advice. Fortunately, Ling Han was not planning to immediately set out for the Seven Wind Mountains.Father and son conversed a moment longer about their daily lives before Ling Han returned to his room, where he took a bath to wash away the dust accumulated during his travel. He took out and changed into a new suit of clothes, though he felt it was a little tight.He was still in the growing period, and within this month of travelling in the wilds, he not only grew taller, but his physique had also become much sturdier. Thus, when he wore the clothes he had worn in the past, he suddenly felt as if the clothes had shrunk a size.Thankfully, the Ling Clan had no lack of money, so Ling Han called for a servant to take his measurements and immediately head to the tailor's to collect some ready-made clothes for him to choose from. But when he spotted Liu Yu Tong, he could not help once again calling for a servant. Then, he had Liu Yu Tong announce her measurements as well, so that the servant could collect some clothes for her too.This beautiful little attendant girl would naturally be attending tonight's banquet with him.Very soon, the servant returned with a pile of clothing. There were more than ten sets of both male and female attire, and Ling Han and Liu Yu Tong slowly browsed through them. Ling Han very quickly made his choice, but Liu Yu Tong tried one suit after another. She appeared not to be too satisfied with the suits, yet also seemed to have much interest in every one of them.Liu Yu Tong finally made her decision right about when the sun was about to set. After she had changed, Ling Han could not help giving a whistle.Truly beautiful.She was already an exquisitely beautiful girl. Now that she had changed into a long, lake water green dress, her delicate, well-shaped figure was on full display. Her round breasts, slender waist, slightly uplifted behind, together with a pair of shapely long legs, formed an image of complete femininity.She had even deliberately put on some light make-up, allowing her facial features to be even more distinctly displayed. She really did make a tempting picture.Seeing Ling Han's slightly shocked expression, Liu Yu Tong could not help feeling a little proud. All this while, she had experienced a lot of shock because of Ling Han, and now that she had finally given him a little payback, she felt very pleased, so much that even the corners of her lips had lifted up in a smile.She was originally an icy beauty. Now, with a smile on her face, it seemed as if the ice had melted and she looked truly lovely and alluring, elegant and graceful. Even Ling Han, with his firm composure, could not help staring.\"Let's go!\" Liu Yu Tong slightly raised her jade-like chin, creating an attractive arch, making her look a little arrogant.Beauties will be beauties, every move and action would make an observer carefree and pleased.But when they exited the residence, Liu Yu Tong still had her beautiful face veiled, and carefully hid her alluring features behind the veil. Ling Han secretly felt this was a bit of a pity, yet at the same time, he felt a little pleased too, for the beautiful face of his little attendant girl could only be admired by him alone.\"Oh, right, do you know of any prominent geniuses in Da Yuan City?\" Ling Han asked, while they were walking.Liu Yu Tong's steps paused, and she said, \"Are you intending to participate in the Da Yuan Tournament?\"\"You're quite smart,\" Ling Han smiled.\"Rain Country has a nationwide great tournament that is held once every three years. If you manage to get into the top fifty in the Da Yuan Tournament, then you're guaranteed enrollment within Hu Yang Academy,\" Liu Yu Tong said. \"This was originally meant to discover geniuses for Rain Country.\"So that's how it is, Da Yuan City was not the only example.\"If you're talking about geniuses...\" Liu Yu Tong pondered for a moment, lightly opened her mouth, and spoke, \"The imperial city is too far away from here, so I'm not really sure. I only know of one person, because he is also a student of Hu Yang Academy.\"\"And who's that?\" Ling Han asked casually.\"Qi Yong Ye, the fourth son of the current Da Yuan King. Others gave him the nickname: King of Eternal Night. He truly is extremely talented, with exceedingly high battle strength. When he was in the sixth layer of Element Gathering Tier, he had once killed a warrior in the eighth layer of Element Gathering Tier,\" Liu Yu Tong did not hide her expression of admiration. Killing and defeating were two different matters after all.\"Three years ago, he was in the sixth layer of Element Gathering Tier, and he had already gotten the second place in the Da Yuan Tournament. Now, he should already be in the ninth layer of Element Gathering Tier.\"This truly was an extremely powerful opponent. Ling Han's battle spirit uplifted--it would be invigorating to trample such a strong opponent.The two of them rendezvoused with Ling Dong Xing, and the company of three boarded a carriage that set out from the Ling Clan Residence. Meanwhile, closely following behind them were Ling Zhong Kuan and his grandson, who had also boarded a carriage of their own.\"Father, you still haven't dealt with them?\" Ling Han asked.\"When all is said and done, Ling Zhong Kuan is still the Chief Butler. Moreover, he has been running things for so many years that his power is deeply rooted. Although I've managed to remove some of his power, he's not someone I can deal with in a short period of time,\" Ling Dong Xing frowned, looking slightly displeased.This pair of grandfather and grandson actually dared to try to steal the opportunity to enroll in Hu Yang Academy he had earned for his son, they were truly despicable!Ling Han nodded. In the end, it was still the issue of actual power. If Ling Dong Xing was in the Gushing Spring Tier, then no matter how bold Ling Zhong Kuan was, he would not dare have any wild thoughts.The carriage swayed slightly on the way, and after about twenty minutes, they had arrived at the main door to the Cheng Clan Residence.The Cheng Clan was the other Great Clan of Gray Cloud Town, so naturally their mansion was not something that common people's real estate could compare to. It occupied a space of a few tens of acres, the high walls of the mansion towering like a giant, creeping beast.Not only the Ling Clan was invited to the banquet tonight, for all clans that were even slightly powerful within Gray Cloud Town had all received invitations. Thus, the Cheng Clan had already spread out a red carpet at their main entrance, with eight servants standing on either side. Every time a guest arrived, these servants would announce their arrival loudly and clearly, and naturally, there would be someone to come out from the residence to receive the guest.When Ling Han and his companions stepped down from their carriage, immediately, a servant announced loudly, \"Noble guest has arrived!\"\"Haha, Brother Ling, I've waited a long time for you!\" A middle-aged man stepped out to receive them, raising his clasped hands in the direction of Ling Dong Xing. His face was redder than dates, and his figure tall and sturdy. He was the Cheng Clan Clan Head, Cheng Wen Kun.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Those who didn't know the story would definitely not think that they were arch-enemies--either of them wanted nothing more than to see the other dead.Ling Han gave a shrug. He had an utmost dislike for this kind of false politeness. Thankfully, in his last life, he was a genius of alchemy, thus there were only those who would flatter and curry favor with him and there was no need for him to do the same with anyone.Cheng Wen Kun didn't even glance at Ling Han, as if he did not know that this was the person that had injured his two sons, and also the culprit behind the economic war between the two clans.\"Han'er, don't go too far,\" Ling Dong Xing instructed.\"Yes, Father!\" Ling Han answered and followed him with Liu Yu Tong in tow.Under the guidance of Cheng Wen Kun, they arrived very quickly at the Main Hall, where there were about a hundred banquet tables. At the moment, there were quite many who were already seated. As there was a name written on every banquet table, an incident of sitting at the wrong table would not happen easily.The one who had made the arrangements for the Main Hall was a very attentive person, as he had considered the fact that some guests may arrive with female companions. As a result, although there was space for ten people at every banquet table, there would only be about five names written on each.After Ling Han and Liu Yu Tong found their table, they took their seats.\"Young Master Han!\"There were already three others seated at this banquet table. They all greeted Ling Han, their faces filled with respect.They were all young people, and also students of Gray Cloud Academy. Not too long ago, they had all witnessed Ling Han display his invincible might and defeat Cheng Xiang and his brother, plus they've also heard the fact that he was in the seventh layer of Body Refining Tier. Thus, they naturally dared not to display the slightest bit of contempt.A sixteen-year-old in the seventh layer of Body Refining Tier.... in Gray Cloud Town, this kind of individual would more than deserve the name of genius.Ling Han smiled in response. After all, they were giving him face, so naturally, there was no reason for him to give them the cold shoulder.After a short while, Ling Mu Yun too took his seat at this table, and while he looked as if he had not seen Ling Han at all, his whole face was stiff. After another short while, Cheng Xiang walked over and also took a seat at this particular table.\"Ling Han, you're not looking too bad!\" Cheng Xiang smiled coldly at Ling Han.Ling Han gave him a look over and said, \"Hehe, the injuries on your face seem to have recovered quite quickly.\"Cheng Xiang's face reddened instantly. He considered the fact that he had been publicly defeated by Ling Han a great dishonor. Moreover, he was even forced to beg for mercy. Every time he recalled the incident, he wanted to commit suicide. However, after today, he would be able to completely erase this blemish on his honor and regain his pride.\"You can only have this short while to be pleased with yourself!\" He said, coldly smiling, \"Later, you will be kneeling in front of me to beg for my forgiveness!\"\"Have you not taken your medicine? Or have you had an overdose?\" Ling Han said, smiling.Cheng Xiang did not say anything more, but the corners of his lips lifted up slightly, forming a mysterious smile.The number of guests quickly increased. At first, most of the guests were still freely walking around. After all, this kind of banquet was also a good chance to endear yourself to your betters and to discuss business. But as more and more guests arrived, most sat down in their respective seats to wait for the banquet to begin.The hostile relationship of the Ling Clan with the Cheng Clan was observed by all. They were the two greatest parties in Gray Cloud Town. If Cheng Clan decided to yield to Ling Han now, then after this, the Ling Clan would become the most dominant party in Gray Cloud Town.As a result, there were many guests attending the banquet tonight; they were all here to witness a possibly historical moment.Very soon, Cheng Wen Kun stood up and waved his hands in various directions, signifying that he had something to say. Most of the guests who had been whispering to each other also ceased their respective conversations, and the Main Hall became extremely quiet.Was he going to admit defeat to the Ling Clan in public?\"The reason why I've invited all of you tonight here is to introduce someone to you,\" Cheng Wen Kun began.As these words were heard, all those present put on blank expressions.What was going on here? Wasn't the Cheng Clan supposed to be admitting defeat to the Ling Clan? How did this become someone's reception banquet? If they had known earlier, most of the guests would not have attended this banquet.\"Shua,\" the attention of the guests all switched focus to Ling Dong Xing. Now that the Cheng Clan has made such a move, then the one bearing the brunt of it would naturally be this Clan Head of the Ling Clan. They wanted to see how he would react.But what invoked disappointment of most of the guests was the fact that Ling Dong Xing's face still maintained a serene smile, as if he couldn't care less.Cheng Wen Kun continued to speak, \"This person would be my nephew, Cheng Xiao Yuan, who left the clan at thirteen years old to become the disciple of one of the Elders of Stone Wolf Sect. Now that he has become slightly skilled, he has returned for a family visit.\"Stone Wolf Sect!All present experienced shock. The Stone Wolf Sect was the overlord within the surrounding thousand miles, and held ultimate power over tens of towns--including Gray Cloud Town. They could be considered the ultimate local tyrant. Cheng Wen Kun suddenly revealing this hidden card obviously meant that he had no plan to admit defeat to the Ling Clan. Instead, he was planning to use the Stone Wolf Sect to suppress the Ling Clan.However, no matter how it was, Cheng Xiao Yuan was just a disciple of one of the Elders of Stone Wolf Sect, so his ability should be quite limited, right?\"Xiao Yuan has also very fortunately invited a very respected, noble guest!\" Cheng Wen Kun was all smiles. This was his real trump card, \"Let us welcome Chen Feng Lie, Elder Chen!\"Elder!An Elder of Stone Wolf Sect? That was a powerful existence in Gushing Spring Tier!Cheng Wen Kun took the lead in clapping his hands in welcome, and consecutively, the other guests all joined in the applause. At this moment, an old man walked out of the living room and appeared in their midst. He had a medium-sized figure and was clad completely in vermilion. He had a full head of black hair and a rosy complexion that shone with a strange glow.Behind the old man closely followed a young man, who had his hands held at his sides and brow lowered, presenting an image of utmost respect.Without doubt, this old man must be Chen Feng Lie, while the young man should be Cheng Xiao Yuan.Chen Feng Lie strode towards the host's table and, as if there wasn't anyone else around him, took his seat, appearing extremely arrogant. But no one dared to express disapproval towards this kind of attitude from him, because he was a powerful warrior in Gushing Spring Tier. Even if the man was only in the first layer of Gushing Spring Tier, he'd be able to easily dominate a person in the ninth layer of Element Gathering Tier. This was the ironclad rule of martial arts.He did not speak a single word the whole while. In his eyes, this was the natural order of events. There was absolutely no one here that deserved to speak to him--had Cheng Xiao Yuan not begged and pleaded with him for many days, he would not even deign to show his face at such a setting.Cheng Wen Kun directed a self-satisfied glance at Ling Dong Xing. His meaning was more or less, 'I've even managed to invite an Elder from the Stone Wolf Sect here, and you still dare to oppose me?'Cheng Xiao Yuan did not sit with Chen Feng Lie at the host's table. Instead, he made his way to sit next to Cheng Xiang grandly.This guy was in the Element Gathering Tier. He should not have broken through too long ago, as he was still in the first layer of Element Gathering Tier.\"Young Brother Xiang, I heard you had a spar with someone some days ago and lost?\" Cheng Xiao Yuan asked Cheng Xiang.\"I was less skilled than my opponent, ai!\" Cheng Xiang gave a deliberate sigh.\"Oh?\" Cheng Xiao Yuan rose a brow, and said, \"Who did you lose to? I would like to take a look at this person!\"\"Hehe, he's seemingly far away, but actually close at hand!\" Cheng Xiang's gaze turned towards Ling Han.\"So you lost to this young genius?\" Cheng Xiao Yuan smiled coldly, also looking at Ling Han, and said in challenge, \"Do you dare to have a spar with me?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 38": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Alchemy Emperor of the Divine DaoCH 38Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis pair of cousins continued their pleasant banter. How could the others not see that this was a deliberate challenge aimed at Ling Han?The corners of Cheng Xiang's lips slightly lifted, and said loftily, \"I forgot to mention, this cousin of mine just broke through to the Element Gathering Tier last year, and now he's about to achieve the peak of the first layer of Element Gathering Tier; it could even be said that he's an exceptional genius.\"Meanwhile, Cheng Xiao Yuan smiled modestly, and said, \"I only broke through to the Element Gathering Tier at twenty years old, so I can't really be considered any kind of exceptional genius. I am only one step ahead of most people.\"When they heard him say this, the others seated at the banquet table all held shocked expressions.Element Gathering Tier!Although Cheng Xiang was in the ninth layer of Body Refining Tier and was only nineteen years old, to advance such a big step forward would need at least three, five years--or it may not even be achieved in a lifetime. Thus, Cheng Xiao Yuan was being overly modest. Someone who broke through to the Element Gathering Tier at twenty years old definitely deserved the name of a genius.Of course, the praise of \"exceptional genius\" was a bit of an exaggeration. After all, Gray Cloud Town was still too small a place, so any person who displayed a slight bit of outstanding talent would be named as \"genius\".The common knowledge of martial arts was that difference of tiers was a gap that was near impossible to breach during fight.Everyone looked at Ling Han, wondering how was this guy going to solve the predicament he was currently facing.If he accepted the challenge, then he would definitely lose. Cheng Xiao Yuan may even kill him--with an Elder from Stone Wolf Sect present, what did he dare not do? But if he did not accept the challenge, then the reputation he had worked so hard to build up would collapse. He was trapped between a rock and a hard place.But if you compare the possible consequences of each decision, then one should understand that refusing the challenge was the wisest move to make. After all, accepting the challenge could possible result in death.They wanted to shame him?Ling Han's gaze focused on Cheng Xiang before switching to Cheng Xiao Yuan, and he couldn't help the corners of his lips lifting up in a smile. This scheme was quite well planned, but the Cheng Clan would never have imagined that he had already advanced into Element Gathering Tier, as well as the fact that his Five Element Origin Nuclei gifted him with incomparable power.\"All right, then let's spar for a bit,\" he said with a smile.What, Ling Han actually agreed?Not only did the others never think of such a thing happening, even Cheng Xiang and his cousin were shocked. But after a while, they both smiled coldly. Since this brat was looking for death, then let's give him a hand!If Ling Dong Xing could not hold himself back from assisting his son, then Cheng Feng Lie too would take action to kill him too. This was what they hoped would happen. The script for tonight's show was to find an excuse to eliminate both Ling Dong Xing and Ling Han.Even Ling Mu Yun could barely conceal the elation he felt. He too wanted nothing more than for Ling Han to die.For clans of martial artists, spars during banquets were something quite common. They only needed to clear some space outside the living room and there was a ready-made battleground.With the deliberate publicizing from Cheng Xiang, the news that Ling Han would be having a spar with Cheng Xiao Yuan spread to every table. Additionally, the individual strength of the two fighters, or at least the battle prowess of Cheng Xiao Yuan, was made known to everyone.This was a battle with a conclusion that held absolutely no suspense. Could it be that Ling Han was too proud and arrogant to refuse the challenge?The two fighters stepped into the courtyard outside the Main Hall. There was an empty space of about ten metres cleared out here. Although it was not really very wide, it was more than enough for the upcoming battle.\"You really are an idiot!\" Cheng Xiao Yuan smiled coldly, killing intent exuding from him. He purposely lowered his voice and said, \"I will slaughter you!\"\"Oh?\" Ling Han gave a snort, \"You are really daydreaming!\"\"Then die!\" Cheng Xiao Yuan gave a loud laugh, his fist flying towards Ling Han. He had no need to use any kind of martial arts skill--he fully believed that, with the strength of a warrior at the peak of the first layer of Element Gathering Tier, he would be able to easily crush Ling Han.There was a saying in martial arts which meant that enough strength would subdue ten rounds of battle. Under the pretext that there was too great a gulf between two fighters' respective strengths, there was absolute no need for any kind of martial arts techniques.Ling Han held no fear as he too responded with a fist flying towards Cheng Xiao Yuan.With everyone fixing their eyes on them, the two fists crashed into one another, and a powerful ripple suddenly erupted, radiating out in all directions. \"Peng peng peng peng\", a few of those who stood the closest suddenly collapsed.Meanwhile, Ling Han and Cheng Xiao Yuan were still maintaining their previous stances, their two fists pushing against each other.'What!'Seeing such a scene, everyone was greatly shocked, their faces filled with utter disbelief. Some who had been eating immediately spat out what they had been eating, accidentally covering the faces of those who had been so unfortunate as to sit opposite. For a short moment, the scene was one of complete chaos.Ling Han actually countered Cheng Xiao Yuan with a fist, and it even seemed like their power was evenly matched?How could this be possible!Cheng Xiao Yuan's arrogant expression had completely disappeared as he said, deeply frowning, \"Element Gathering Tier?\"Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, \"You're not the only one who can break through.\"In truth, almost everyone had already guessed it, but when they heard Ling Han's confirmation, a new wave of shocked exclamations still emerged.Previously, when Cheng Xiao Yuan broke through to the Element Gathering Tier at twenty years old, he was already praised as an exceptional genius, yet now, Ling Han was only sixteen years old!Sixteen years old and in the Element Gathering Tier? Gods, this was crazy!Everyone turned gazes full of incomprehension towards Ling Han. This guy was a publicly acclaimed trash just more than a month ago--how did he, in such a short time, reverse his fortunes?\"Brother Ling, you truly have a wonderful son!\" Cheng Wen Kun said in an awe-inspiring tone, his voice failing to conceal his killing intent.A sixteen-year-old boy who had already achieved the Element Gathering Tier was much too terrifying. He was even more talented than Ling Dong Xing had been years ago--in the past, he had always compared himself with Ling Dong Xing, but now matter how much effort he expended, the gulf between himself and Ling Dong Xing only became wider and wider... until the moment when Ling Dong Xing returned to Gray Cloud Town, his strength stagnated in the ninth layer of Element Gathering Tier. This was what finally gave him a chance to catch up to him.But he had never imagined that Ling Han's talent was even more prominent!He definitely could not allow this brat to live. Otherwise, perhaps in a few years' time, this brat could even possibly break through to Gushing Spring Tier, and at that moment, the Cheng Clan could only bow beneath the might of the Ling Clan.Ling Dong Xing smiled faintly. In the past, his son had caused him much heartache, yet now, Ling Dong Xing only felt immeasurably proud of him. He said, \"Just so-so, still can't compare to your Clan's Xiao Yuan, who had already broken through a year ago.\"Damn it, how could a twenty-year-old who broke through compare with a sixteen-year-old who broke through?Within the courtyard, Cheng Xiao Yuan took a deep breath, yet his heart was filled with overwhelming shock. He had heard Cheng Xiang mention before that Ling Han was only in the seventh layer of Body Refining Tier just over a month ago, and yet he had astonishingly broken through to Element Gathering Tier now... this progression rate was really much too horrifying!Could it be that this brat had some kind of treasure that allowed him to speed up his cultivation rate?When he thought about this, his eyes instantly lit up. It must be--this brat's reputation as a piece of trash was well-known all over town, but he had, all of a sudden, turned so powerful. It must have been that he had obtained some kind of colossal opportunity.'Well, it belongs to me now.'Thinking of this, Cheng Xiao Yuan opened up his fists, revealing his palms. He intended to use a martial arts technique.Earth Shaking Palm, Yellow Grade high level martial arts technique.This was a technique he had obtained when he had been on a training trip at a historical site. It not only allowed him to have an additional powerful secret art, but when he handed it over to the Stone Wolf Sect, he had also been rewarded with a \"Origin Gathering Pill\", which helped him to break through to Element Gathering Tier in one go!Otherwise, there was no way he would have been able to break through to Element Gathering Tier when he was twenty years old.He was filled with confidence. A Yellow Grade high level martial arts technique was considered top-rate even in Stone Wolf Sect. The martial arts techniques that had been passed down through the Ling and Cheng Clans were only Yellow Grade medium level martial arts techniques at best. He fully believed that once he used Earth Shaking Palm, he would still be able to easily control the situation.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, this fist technique was retained from his last life, so he would naturally not be unfamiliar with it. Even if it had not reached the point where he had mastered this fist technique, he had still reached the level that would take any other person tens of years of practice to reach.After all, when it came down to it, the prowess he had once possessed as a martial artist in Heaven Tier didn't disappear without a trace.When he used this fist technique, it was as if he transformed into a panther on the hunt--cruel, bloodthirsty and terrifying.\"Peng, peng, peng,\" Ling Han had already engaged Cheng Xiao Yuan in a fierce battle of strength.\"Eh, what kind of fist technique is this?\"\"The Ling Clan has three ultimate martial arts techniques--one is a sword art, one is a staff technique, and the last one is a palm technique. They don't have any fist technique.\"\"Could it be that this is a Yellow Grade low level martial arts technique?\"\"But would a Yellow Grade low level martial arts technique have such great power?\"Everyone was gasping in surprise, all astounded by the strength Ling Han had displayed.Cheng Xiao Yuan's heart was filled with incomprehension. He had already used a Yellow Grade high level martial arts technique, but why was he still unable to overwhelm Ling Han? Could it be that a minor character from this insignificant Gray Cloud Town had also managed to obtain a Yellow Grade high level martial arts technique?Impossible! That's definitely impossible!They had only exchanged a few blows, yet the pressure on Cheng Xiao Yuan grew larger and larger. Cold sweat dripped down his forehead.The reason was, the power behind his opponent's every punch seemed to be continuously increasing, making it seem as if this guy had just learnt this fist technique, and as he continued to use it more and more, the power behind his attacks too increased further.Actually, he wasn't mistaken--it was the truth.Dashing Panther Fist was a martial arts technique Ling Han had used before reaching Gushing Spring Tier in his last life. He had not used it for a very long time, and now that he had picked it up again, he was naturally out of practice. However, a genius would always be a genius. They had only been battling for a while, and Ling Han had already come into his own, and was slowly displaying the power behind this fist technique.A Yellow Grade high level martial arts technique theoretically would be able to increase the user's battle strength by seventy to a hundred percent. However, how much actual power would actually be released depended on the martial artist's grasp and comprehension of this martial arts technique.Otherwise, a Yellow Grade high level martial arts technique may not even be able to compare with a Yellow Grade low level martial arts technique.Cheng Xiao Yuan could release about eighty percent of the power behind Earth Shaking Palm, yet Ling Han could release ninety percent of the power of his own martial arts technique, and the amount of power he released was still increasing.In this manner, Cheng Xiao Yuan was naturally at a disadvantage, and it was becoming more and more obvious.This was Ling Han's ability--and he had only just stepped into Element Gathering Tier. Had he reached the peak of the first layer of Element Gathering Tier, he'd be able to evenly match an opponent in the fifth layer of Element Gathering Tier!\"Genius!\"\"Who would have thought that the trash from the Ling Clan was actually such a genius!\"\"It's really inconceivable... since he's such a genius, why had he been so low-key in the past?\"\"Let me tell you a secret. When Ling Dong Xing returned to the Ling Clan Residence years ago, he was completely covered in blood, holding an infant in his arms!\"\"You mean, Ling Dong Xing had been hunted down by some powerful martial artist, and that's why he and his son had kept such a low profile? But then, why has Ling Han chosen to erupt now?\"\"You ask me.... and whom should I ask?\"Previously, although Ling Han had defeated both Cheng Xiang and his brother within the grounds of Gray Cloud Academy, it made only a vague impression on the minds of most people. After all, there was only a limited number of students who had actually witnessed the scene.But the situation was completely different now. Ling Han had not only broken through to Element Gathering Tier, but had also displayed a remarkably powerful battle prowess, pushing his image to new heights!After all, in Gray Cloud Town, those who had actually broken through to the Element Gathering Tier would enter the ranks of the strongest warriors.Ling Han continued to throw out his fists, and soon, what appeared to be an unknown fist technique became more and more practiced. His moves quickly became stronger and stronger, nearing a complete one hundred percent of power released.Fist techniques were analogous to sword arts as they could form Fist Qi, which could consecutively solidify into Fist Point. According to legends, in ancient times, when a star fell from the skies, a powerful warrior stepped forward bravely, and with one fist, shattered the star!This powerful warrior was an elite martial artist that had mastered fist techniques. Moreover, he had not only managed to form Fist Point, but had also grasped the highest mastery level of fist techniques--Fist Heart! Similarly, the highest mastery level of sword arts was Sword Heart, while for saber arts, it was Saber Heart.Ling Han did not have such high talent in fist techniques. He had not even managed to form Fist Qi. After all, he was better at sword arts. However, even his current level of fist techniques was more than enough to deal with Cheng Xiao Yuan.He used Exiting Cloud Step, making it seem as if his figure was floating. Those in Body Refining Tier could only feel the sight in front of their eyes blurring, as if they had seen several images of Ling Han and had completely no way to identify which one was the real one.\"Peng! Peng! Peng!\"He was completely at an advantage. Cheng Xiao Yuan only managed to block a part of his continuous barrage of fists, and some blows had already found their targets on his body. Although no vital parts of his body were hit, Cheng Xiao Yuan still felt pain on a level that almost caused him to tear up.Ling Han had completely no intention of holding back. This guy had obviously already planned to kill him and thus anger Ling Dong Xing, causing him to lose control in his rage, which in turn would enrage Chen Feng Lie. Thus, they would easily have a ready-made excuse to kill both him and his father.Since Cheng Xiao Yuan was so malicious, why should he hold himself back?One fist followed after another, and the speed of his attacks rapidly increased, slowly forming a flash of Fist Qi. With every sweep of a fist, there would definitely appear a splatter of blood on Cheng Xiao Yuan's body--Fist Qi, like Sword Qi, was incomparably powerful. At the highest mastery level, there was nothing in this world that cannot be shattered with one fist! [1]\"What is that, such a terrifying attack power!\"\"That's true, it's as if he had fixed an exceptionally amazing sword onto his fist.\"\"I know, that's Fist Qi!\"\"What's Fist Qi?\"\"Sword, Saber, Fist, Palm, and so on. One who puts their entire focus on one path would be able to form \"Qi\", which greatly increases the power of a martial artist.\"\"How is it I've never heard about this before?\"\"That's because there are only a very rare few that can actually form 'Qi'! They have been acclaimed as... the rulers amongst martial artists!\"Everyone was shocked at the power Ling Han had displayed, and with the helpful explanation from a knowledgeable old man, they realized the terrifying strength of Fist Qi. Naturally, they were even more astonished. Could it be that an exceptional genius was going to appear from within the ranks of Gray Cloud Town?Meanwhile, there was no one more astonished than Liu Yu Tong, because she knew that Ling Han had not only managed to form Fist Qi, but had also formed Sword Qi before this, and actually possessed four flashes of Sword Qi!What kind of monster was this guy!Yet, Ling Han took no pride in his achievement. As one who had been a strong warrior of Heaven Tier, being able to form \"Qi\" was merely within his expectations. The slight difficulty would be when he tries to form \"Qi\" into \"Point\", and \"Heart\" would be the actual real challenge.Killing intent flashed within his eyes, and his fist flew out all of a sudden; the power behind it had instantly increased by several times!With Chen Feng Lie overseeing things, in a normal situation, it would be very difficult for him to kill Cheng Xiao Yuan as Chen Feng Lie would definitely take action to stop him. Thus, he had to kill Cheng Xiao Yuan in one move.After such a long battle, he could naturally identify his opponent's weak point. Additionally, he had not used his full power previously, conserving his strength for this last killing move.\"No!\" Cheng Xiao Yuan's face was filled with terror. The power behind this fist was too much. He had no way of blocking it and coming out alive.\"Peng!\"A fist flashed out, and Cheng Xiao Yuan gazed at Ling Han blankly. \"Pa,\" his legs grew soft and he knelt on the ground as his upper body swayed before he toppled loudly onto the ground.His heart had exploded, and he was dead.\"How dare you, brat!\" Chen Feng Lie suddenly stood, and flames of rage burned strongly within his eyes.Cheng Xiao Yuan was his disciple only in name, but no matter how it was, he was still a proud member of Stone Wolf Sect. He was not someone the young master of a tiny little clan in Gray Cloud Town could kill.His killing intent surged out completely. The pride of Stone Wolf Sect could not be tarnished. He wanted to kill Ling Han.\"Old man, if you don't want to die, then I advise you not to have any wild thoughts,\" Ling Han said deeply, as he turned to look at Chen Feng Lie.Everyone on the scene bore the same thought: Ling Han had gone mad!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Compared with such a powerful entity, no matter if it was the Ling Clan or the Cheng Clan, neither clan had the qualifications to be compared with it on the same level.Was Ling Han deliberately seeking his own demise?Chen Feng Lie was startled for a moment, for he had been shocked by Ling Han's gaze--it was as deep and as vast as the ocean, filled with dignity, as if it belonged to a supreme warrior. However, he quickly realized that he had actually been threatened by a mere martial artist in Element Gathering Tier, and could not help laughing, and deeply said, \"Oh, and how do you plan to kill me?\"\"I don't need to do anything. Within five days, you'll die anyway,\" Ling Han said calmly, and pointed a finger at Chen Feng Lie, \"About ten days ago, when you were cultivating, did you encounter some trouble?\"Chen Feng Lie's expression instantly changed. Just as Ling Han had said, while he had been cultivating ten days ago, he suddenly felt as if he had comprehended something, and decided to break through to the fourth layer of Gushing Spring Tier yet did not succeed. On the contrary, he accidentally caused the Origin Power within his body to enter the wrong pathways, but thankfully, he managed to withdraw in time, and so there was not too much damage done.How did this brat know that? Had he guessed?Ling Han smiled, and said, \"Try to press on the spot three inches below your left ribs.\"Chen Feng Lie's first natural reaction was to say, 'How preposterous!', but his hand could not help moving and pressing down on the spot three inches below his left ribs. With a light touch, his entire expression changed once again.Pain, excruciating pain!\"And the spot half an inch to the right of the seventh bone of your spinal column,\" Ling Han continued to say.Chen Feng Lie once again touched that exact spot, and cold sweat appeared on his forehead. This was definitely not normal.\"You overdid it when you were cultivating. You don't sense anything wrong, because you are still in that state of madness,\" Ling Han said, before revealing a confident smile. \"I can save you.\" [1]Chen Feng Lie clenched his teeth, and said, \"Fine, you teach me how to cure myself, and I will forgive your sin this time!\"\"Elder Chen!\" Cheng Wen Kun was both shocked and enraged. Wouldn't that mean that Cheng Xiao Yuan had died for nothing then?\"En?\" Chen Feng Lie turned his glare towards Cheng Wen Kun, his eyes filled with malevolence. How could a minor character like Cheng Xiao Yuan compare to the importance of his own life?Cheng Wen Kun hurriedly shut up, cold sweat beading on his forehead. To actually dare to talk back to a strong warrior in Gushing Spring Tier... he would die a meaningless death.Yet Ling Han only shook his head, and said, \"In any case, you're in the Gushing Spring Tier, and yet your life is only worth so much?\"Chen Feng Lie's heart was filled with fury, but as his life was held in the hands of another, he could not allow himself to display any of his rage. He could only suppress the flames of anger and say, \"Then what do you want?\"Ling Han smiled softly, and said, \"That will depend on your performance.\"Chen Feng Lie was extremely depressed. He was the Ninth Elder of Stone Wolf Sect and a powerful warrior of Gushing Spring Tier. Under normal circumstances, he would be the one standing at the top, holding court over others. When did he become someone that could be easily manipulated by a puny, little martial artist in Element Gathering Tier?But what else could he do? His life was held in Ling Han's grasp.From the moment Ling Han had accurately pointed out the day he had experienced trouble in his cultivation, and through the agony he felt when he pressed down on the two acupuncture points, he no longer held any doubt and fully believed Ling Han's words.\"Do you have any commands then, Young Master Han?\" He lowered his stance.\"Pu!\"Hearing the words \"Young Master Han\", all the observers immediately gasped in shock.That was an actual Elder from Stone Wolf Sect, a real warrior in the Gushing Spring Tier, and he actually addressed Ling Han as Young Master Han. How could this not induce astonishment?Ling Han revealed a soft smile, and said, \"Are you planning to get the method of solution, and then kill me?\"\"How could that be!\" Chen Feng Lie hurriedly gave a dry laugh, yet he had already started sweating.Ling Han's heart was clear, he naturally would not allow himself to be in danger--he would cure Chen Feng Lie, but would definitely not cure him entirely in one go. He pointed at Cheng Wen Kun, and said, \"This man annoys me, thrash him for me!\"Cheng Wen Kun's face instantly turned green.The reason why he had invited Chen Feng Lie was to gain a powerful support for himself so as to resolve the problem of Ling Dong Xing's closing in on them at every step, causing the stagnation of the finances of the Cheng Clan and leading to the entire clan being forced into a corner.But he had never imagined, that this helper he had invited would actually turn around to help the Ling Clan. How could he not be sullen at this?If anyone were to give him a piece of tofu now, he would definitely knock himself to death with it.\"Senior Chen!\" He stuttered. In front of a powerful warrior of Gushing Spring Tier, his cultivation level of the ninth layer of Element Gathering Tier was practically helpless.\"En? Are you planning to fight back against me?\" Chen Feng Lie said coldly.Cheng Wen Kun had no relationship with him anyways, so naturally, he had absolutely no conflicted feelings about giving the guy a good thrashing. He had already bowed his head to Ling Han just now, so he might as well just go ahead and throw caution to the wind.Cheng Wen Kun's expression changed multiple times, before he finally just gritted his teeth, and said, \"I dare not!\"If he dared resist, he would definitely die. Even a blind man could tell that Chen Feng Lie was extremely unhappy now.\"Pa! Pa!\"Chen Feng Lie raised his hand and lowered it, gifting Cheng Wen Kun with two slaps. The strength behind his blows caused blood to stain the corners of Cheng Wen Kun's lips.There was complete silence in the Main Hall. The only thing disturbing the silence was the harsh breathing of the audience.Who would have thought that things would play out in this manner?Even Ling Dong Xing had never imagined that his son was so capable as to be able to control a powerful warrior in Gushing Spring Tier, causing him to be both shocked and comforted. He truly had a good son!The faces of Cheng Xiang and his brother kept twitching. If there was a hole in the ground now, they would really want to go and hide in it. They had been so confident and arrogant previously, thinking that they could now regain their lost pride. They had never expected that even their old man would be thrashed now.The banquet tonight could practically be added to the Cheng Clan's history of dishonor.Even when Cheng Wen Kun spat out a tooth and swallowed blood due to the thrashing, he still dared not display the slightest anger on his face. Still, no matter how shrewd he was, there was no way he could still put on a carefree expression. The veins on his forehead were protruding, showing that he was obviously at the deepest levels of his fury!'Ling Clan! Ling Clan! I swear, I will definitely destroy you until nothing is left!' He roared angrily within his heart, 'As long as Third Uncle successfully breaks through to Gushing Spring Tier, we will definitely be able to avenge ourselves!'Ling Han nodded, and said to Chen Feng Lie, \"I will write a medicine formula for you, which will help you suppress your injuries temporarily. You will not have any trouble for half a year's time.\"Though Chen Feng Lie did not want to accept this, he also knew that Ling Han would definitely not cure him completely in one go--if it were him, he too would have reservations. After all, Ling Han was the weaker party here. He could thus only nod, and said, \"Many thanks, Young Master Han!\"As things have already played out to this step, the banquet was obviously at an end. Staying any longer would only be awkward. The guests excused themselves one after another while Ling Han left the Cheng Clan Residence in the company of Ling Dong Xing and Liu Yu Tong after handing over the medicine formula to Chen Feng Lie.\"Hahahaha!\" On the carriage, the hearty laughter that Ling Dong Xing had tried so hard to hold back was finally released. He waved a fist vigorously, and said, \"I have competed with Cheng Wen Kun for over half of my life, but I have never released my pent-up anger like tonight! However, Han'er, tonight was still quite dangerous. Had Chen Feng Lie not experienced trouble in his cultivation some days ago, the matter tonight would not have been resolved so easily.\"After all, a disciple of Stone Wolf Sect had died tonight.Ling Han smiled--if he had not noticed that there was something wrong with Chen Feng Lie, he would still have two alternatives to choose from: the first alternative was naturally simple, to not kill Cheng Xiao Yuan, while the second alternative was to still kill Cheng Xiao Yuan, but reveal Liu Yu Tong's identity to take care of the issue.But he no longer needed to consider this problem now.\"One more month, and the Cheng Clan would not even be able to pay the salaries of their own guards. At that time, it'll be our Ling Clan who will be the sole power in Gray Cloud Town!\" Ling Dong Xing declared proudly and enthusiastically.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 41": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Alchemy Emperor of the Divine DaoCH 41Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter the battle at the Cheng Clan Residence, the two clans who had been of equal status in Gray Cloud Town set off towards two different destinies.The influence of the Ling Clan increased day by day, and they soon possessed enough power to be proclaimed the most dominant clan in Gray Cloud Town. On the other hand, the Cheng Clan was trapped in a huge dilemma, forced into a corner. One of the reasons behind it was the stagnation of their economy, but the other more important reason was the fact that their morale had received a heavy blow.Ling Dong Xing really did have a good son!This was currently the common understanding amongst the townspeople of Gray Cloud Town. None of them would recall the fact that just two months ago, this \"good son\" had still been a publicly acclaimed piece of trash and considered a complete joke.The smaller clans in the town began to have frequent dealings with the Ling Clan, hoping to become in-laws with the Ling Clan. Their target naturally was the previously famous trash, and the currently well-known great genius, Ling Han. Of course, the Shen Clan thus became the butt of their jokes.Initially, they had already claimed Ling Han, this excellent potential son-in-law, yet they themselves decided to go back on their own word and reject him.Many wondered how Shen Zi Yan was feeling now.Chen Feng Lie had just left, but another member of the Stone Wolf Sect arrived. His name was Ma Lang. He brought with him a law enforcement team, aggressively interrogating each and every clan, apparently looking for someone.When Ling Han found out, his heart stirred. Could it be that these people had come because of Hang Zhan?Very soon, Ma Lang and his group had arrived at the Ling Clan Residence.The Stone Wolf Sect was overlord within the nearest one thousand miles. Ma Lang was here on behalf of the Stone Wolf Sect, so no matter who it was, everyone had to give him enough face. As a result, the high-ranking members of the Ling Clan had all gathered at the Main Hall to receive this \"Special Envoy\".Ling Han arrived a bit late, and when he entered the Main Hall with Liu Yu Tong in tow, it was already fully occupied. He gave a shake of his head to the servant who had been about to greet him before quietly walking over.There was only one person amongst those present who was not a member of the Ling Clan, and that was a young man all dressed in white. He seemed to be about twenty three or twenty four years old and looked very average, yet there was a very powerful aura being exuded from him, full of an extreme self-confidence.The only flaw was the fact that the smile on this guy's face was much too false, inducing disgust in those who saw it.Aside from him, there also stood a line of people dressed entirely in black outside the Main Hall. All of them were in Element Gathering Tier, but their cultivation levels weren't very high. It appeared that the average cultivation level among them was either second or third layer. None of them seemed to have entered into the fourth layer....Fourth layer and seventh layer will forever be a difficult barrier to breach.'This young man in white should be Ma Lang then,' Ling Han thought, once again turning his eyes towards the former. His cultivation level was much higher than his companions as he had already reached the sixth layer of Element Gathering Tier. Within this area, along with his apparently young age, he definitely would deserve the name of genius. The power of Shen Zi Yan, Cheng Xiang and such so-called \"geniuses\" was less than nothing when compared with this young man.\"Ling Clan Head, within the recent month, has any of your clansmen entered the vicinity of the Balance Mountain?\" Ma Lang asked.Ling Dong Xing's heart skipped a beat. He naturally knew very well that Ling Han had just returned from his trip to Balance Mountain, but now that Ma Lang had so coincidentally asked about it, how could he not be slightly alert? However, no matter how it was, he has had many years of experience in the position of Clan Head, and so was of course very shrewd. His expression did not change the slightest as he said, \"As far as I know, none of my clansmen entered the vicinity of the Balance Mountain.\"Thankfully, Ling Han had both left and returned very secretly. The other members of the clan only knew that Ling Han had disappeared for about a month, but none of them knew where exactly he had gone.\"Is that so!\" Ma Lang gave a nod of his head and did not say anything else. He simply sat there with his eyes closed, seemingly deep in thought.Ling Dong Xing was well aware of the situation, and hurriedly had someone present a wooden box, and said, \"Young Master Ma must have had a difficult journey. Please accept this small token of sincerity from the Ling Clan, Young Master Ma!\"Ma Lang finally opened his eyes, and received the wooden box. He made no pretense of modesty and actually opened it on the spot. Inside only lay several thick pieces of paper, but when Ma Lang flipped through the contents, a smile appeared on his face.These pieces of paper were monetary notes. Each piece had a denomination of five hundred coins, and there were in total four pieces, which equated to two thousand coins. This was really quite a large sum of money.He had come here on a mission, yet had already intended to seek monetary gifts. Who would not fear and respect him when he had brought with him a law reinforcement team from Stone Wolf Sect? After all, he was now considered a representative of Stone Wolf Sect. He had made his rounds around all the minor clans of Gray Cloud Town, leaving the Ling and Cheng Clans last.As expected, Great Clans will be Great Clans. They were always very generous with their \"gifts\".As he had already gotten his hands on \"benefits\", he naturally felt very pleased. He suddenly stood, and said, \"I am under command of our Seventh Elder and am currently trying to apprehend a murderer. If you know of anyone who has entered into the vicinity of Balance Mountain within the last month, Ling Clan Head, please do inform me. I will be remaining in this town for a few more days.\"\"Of course!\" Ling Dong Xing answered. He too stood up, and said, \"Let me see you off, Young Master Ma!\"Ma Lang cheerfully nodded, putting himself in the role of \"imperial envoy\", both hands placed behind his back, taking big strides.\"Young Master Ma!\" And right at this moment, someone suddenly spoke. It was Ling Zhong Kuan.Ma Lang frowned, turning around and saying, \"What is it?\"\"I suddenly recalled, that there is one member of the clan that had disappeared for about a month. Perhaps.... he had gone to Balance Mountain!\" Ling Zhong Kuan said, a cold smile playing about his lips.\"Oh, who is it?\" Ma Lang asked.\"This person's name is Ling Han, he is the son of our Clan Head,\" Ling Zhong Kuan had been waiting for Ma Lang to ask him about it, and so his reply was quick.Hearing such words, all the members of the Ling Clan started cursing Ling Zhong Kuan in their hearts.Putting aside the fact that Ling Han was now a ray of hope to the Ling Clan and a strong pillar of support for the clan in the future, even if he was the trash he had once been, as long as his surname was Ling, you still can't help an outsider hurt your own clansman! And he wanted to become Clan Head with this kind of temperament? The future of the Ling Clan would really become bleak if he succeeded.Ling Dong Xing was naturally raging in his heart, and regretted that he had not tidied up the clan. Based on the fact that they all shared the same surname of Ling, he had not been ruthless, but he had never thought that Ling Zhong Kuan would actually be so heartless himself.Ma Lang turned to look at Ling Dong Xing, and asked, \"Ling Clan Head, was there such a matter?\"Ling Dong Xing's expression remained unchanged, as he said, \"My son did leave on a training trip slightly over a month ago, but he had not gone to Balance Mountain.\"\"Oh, then where had he gone?\" Ma Lang narrowed his eyes.\"Seven Wind Mountains,\" Ling Han stepped out.\"So you're Ling Han?\" Ma Lang turned his gaze to Ling Han.\"I am Ling Han,\" Ling Han noddedMa Lang stared at Ling Han, a grim expression on his face, causing all those present to feel a chill that foretold of an upcoming storm.\"Hahahaha!\" He suddenly laughed, walked over and patted Ling Han's shoulder, saying, \"Don't be so nervous, we are just here to ask around a bit. I still have to go to the Cheng Clan Residence, but I'll return for a visit. I think we will have many common topics to chat about.\"This young man really was very temperamental.Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, \"Hope to see you again.\"\"Ling Clan Head, you don't have to see me off!\" Ma Lang gave a wave of his hands, and left together with his group of black-clad people.When his figure disappeared from sight, all those in the hall finally released the breath they had been holding. Somehow, without themselves realizing it, their bodies had been covered in a layer of cold sweat. This was a sign of how much pressure the presence of this young man had exerted on them.Poisonous snake!That's right, a poisonous snake! This young man was exactly like a poisonous snake! Anyone who shared the same space with him would be anxious to the point of perspiring.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He either ate some kind of Divine Fruit, or obtained some kind of secret treasure. I'll have to go and ask around.\"To know about a person, it would actually be the fastest to find out from his enemy, because it was possible that your enemy may know more about you than you know about yourself.Ma Lang brought his people to the Cheng Clan Residence, and half an hour later, his face was all smiles, excitement filling his eyes.\"Two months ago, that brat had still been a publicly acclaimed trash, yet all of a sudden, he erupted. According to news from the Ling Clan, that brat had only been maintaining a low profile in the past, but however low-key he had been, how could it have been to the point that his betrothed would break the betrothal contract with him?Heng, the people of Gray Cloud Town cannot see clearly because they are closely involved! This brat had obviously gotten his hands on some kind of ultimate treasure, and that's why his cultivation has advanced so much in such a short period of time!How else would it have been possible for a trash with a Five Elements Disarray Spirit Base to suddenly experience such an eruption in his cultivation that he has reached Element Gathering Tier?And, it was even to the point that even Ninth Elder has been bluffed by this brat!Even such a trash could get from the second layer of Body Refining Tier and into Element Gathering Tier within a short two months' time, then if I managed to make use of it....\"Ma Lang's heartbeat uncontrollably and rapidly increased. He was considered a genius existence within this generation of Stone Wolf Sect. At the same time, he was also a disciple of Seventh Elder, and based on power, was ranked within the top three disciples of Stone Wolf Sect. The Elders within the Sect had all placed heavy hopes on his shoulders because he had a hope of breaking through to Gushing Spring Tier.But if he progressed at a normal rate, that would only be possible at least twenty years later.\"Once I get my hands on that treasure, within three years, no, maybe even one year, I'd be able to break through to Gushing Spring Tier. After all, I possess an Earth Grade medium level Spirit Base. My natural talent overwhelms that trash by who knows how many times!However, the Ling Clan's power is not weak either. I cannot act impulsively. Otherwise, if the Ling Clan is driven to desperate action, they may even choose to destroy the treasure rather than hand it over to me. In that case, I will not be able to obtain that treasure then.Plus, if I create too much noise here, it might attract the attention of the stronger members of the Sect. Then there would be no chance for me to get that treasure.Additionally, that brat seems to have some kind of relationship with Ninth Elder. Although there is a big gap between the status of Ninth Elder and Master, if he steps out, I still can't openly disobey him.So, this matter must be done subtly......That's right, I have quite a good relationship with Little Poison Lord, Yu Zheng. This person is skilled in the use of poisons, and has the nickname of \"Shadowless Poisonous Hands\". If I make him give me a hand, I'd definitely be able to easily take Ling Han down. After I force him to hand over the secret treasure he has, I'll have Yu Zheng executed and announce to the public that he is the murderer of Hang Zhan.As for the other members of the Ling Clan... I'll have them all killed just in case, to avoid any possible information leaks.I'll immediately have someone send a letter to Little Poison Lord. I will remain here and pretend to befriend that brat while simultaneously inquiring about the origins of that secret treasure.Less than a month, and this secret treasure will belong to me!\"***After Ma Lang arrived in Gray Cloud Town, he continued to hang around, and every few days, he would go to the Ling Clan Residence to have a drink and chat with Ling Han, as if he had hit it off with Ling Han at first sight. But on the other hand, the guy was extremely greedy, and kept finding excuses to get offerings from all the other minor clans.Intimidated by the might of Stone Wolf Sect, as well as scared off by the law reinforcement team he had brought with him, he managed to succeed every time.It was almost a month since he first came, and there were angry complaints from all the clans of Gray Cloud Town. They wanted nothing more than to chase away this bloodsucker from their town.Yet Ling Han acted as if nothing was happening. He persisted in working hard at cultivating every day as he wanted to reach the peak period of the first layer of Element Gathering Tier as soon as possible, so that he'd have enough assurance to enter into Seven Wind Mountains to search for the Earth Dragon Grass and return safely.During this month of hard work, he had almost reached the peak period of this layer. His Five Elements Origin Nuclei were also nearing their ultimate form. The speed of rotation could no longer be increased, not even by a little bit. Otherwise, he would immediately throw up blood.However, this rotation speed was still much faster than it had been in his last life as the five nuclei had reached a perfect balance, and thus increased his capacity by quite a large amount.He had also concocted many different alchemical pills within this time period, including some medium-level Return Origin Pills, as well as some antidote pills. This was the preparation work for dealing with the Red Scaled Dragon Snake. He obtained the ingredients for these pills from Heaven's Medicine Pavilion. In exchange, he handed over some completed pills as payment, causing Zhu He Xin to be incomparably excited as these pills were concocted by a Grandmaster, and thus had much research value.'My current power level is equivalent to a normal martial artist in the fifth layer of Element Gathering Tier,' Ling Han thought, an expression of admiration appearing on his face. Immortal Grade Spirit Base is Immortal Grade Spirit Base alright. The owner had already obtained an absolutely advantageous position when fighting with an opponent of the same cultivation level. There was practically no chance of defeat.'To take one month to fully cultivate a layer... this is much slower than what I had expected. However, it's still much faster than Yu Tong. Still, when compared with Body Refining Tier, the natural advantage of Immortal Grade Spirit Base has decreased by a lot.''If I take alchemical pills as well, then the rate can still be increased slightly,\" Ling Han thought.However, Gray Cloud Town was too small, so pills that could help a martial artist in Element Gathering Tier speed up his cultivation rate were very rarely sold there. Even the ingredients for such pills were rare.\"Kou, kou, kou,\" a knock sounded on the door. Liu Yu Tong entered and said, \"Ma Lang is here again.\"Ling Han revealed a disdainful smile, and said, \"He must be thinking that I've obtained some kind of secret treasure, and that's why my cultivation progress is so rapid. He has tried to sniff out information from me quite a few times.\"\"Do you need me to send him away?\" Liu Yu Tong asked.She was in the ninth layer of Element Gathering Tier and, furthermore, was close to reaching the peak period of the ninth layer. It would be as easy as turning over her hand to deal with a martial artist in the fourth layer of Element Gathering Tier.\"No need, it seems like his patience is close to being completely exhausted. It's about time for him to lay his cards on the table,\" Ling Han shook his head. His eyes were bright. Ma Lang was in the peak period of the fourth layer of Element Gathering Tier, and this would be a good opportunity for him to test out his own battle prowess.He walked towards the Main Hall with Liu Yu Tong in tow. Ling Dong Xing was already seated within the Main Hall. Both Ling Zhong Kuan and his grandson were present too, though they were standing at one side, big smiles on their faces. Who knows what kind of poisonous thoughts they were entertaining.'It is about time to completely dispose of Ling Zhong Kuan and his group,' Ling Han thought.However, aside from Ma Lang, there was another young man dressed all in black. He looked like a living dead, for there was absolutely no expression on his face.\"Brother Ling, we haven't met for a few days, how have you been?\" Ma Lang stood, his eyes circling around Liu Yu Tong's beautiful, shapely figure, revealing some heat.Such an exceptional beauty caused even his heart to skip a beat. He swore that after he had killed Ling Han and obtained the secret treasure the latter had, he would definitely get his hands on this rare woman.Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, \"I am very well.\"While Ling Dong Xing commanded someone to serve tea, Ma Lang enthusiastically offered Ling Han an invitation to visit Stone Wolf Sect for fun.As Ling Han raised the tea cup, and lifted the cover of the cup, his expression instantly changed slightly.There was poison in the cup!He was an alchemist, and alchemists always have a very deep understanding of poisons and venoms as some alchemical pills required certain poisonous ingredients in their concoction, fighting fire with fire.\"Pa!\"He waved out a palm, and his Origin Power created a tremor that instantly shattered the teacup Ling Dong Xing had raised to his lips, the tea within it splattering in all directions.\"Han'er!\" Ling Dong Xing was shocked. He had no idea what his son was doing.\"There's poison in the tea!\" Ling Han said.\"What?\" A severe expression flashed in Ling Dong Xing's eyes. His first reaction was not to doubt his son's judgement, but to turn his glare towards Ling Zhong Kuan and his grandson. The only one present who had the motive as well as the ability to poison their tea would definitely be Ling Zhong Kuan.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This kind of crime would definitely cause him to die a hundred times!More importantly, he really didn't do such a thing!The old man had plotted many schemes throughout his life and had done quite a number of bad things, but it was still the first time that he had experienced being wrongly accused by someone else! In his fury, even his face had turned green.Ling Dong Xing naturally knew that he himself did not place the poison, and Ma Lang had no reason to, so then the largest suspect could only be Ling Zhong Kuan. He humphed and said, \"Ling Zhong Kuan, because we both are members of the Ling Clan, I have always tolerated you, but this time, you've gone too far!\"If Ma Lang died here, he, as the Clan Head of the Ling Clan, would not be able to escape responsibility.\"It's not him!\" Ling Han shook his head.\"Not him?\" Ling Dong Xing's face was filled with surprise, while Ling Zhong Kuan had an expression of disbelief. He had never imagined that Ling Han would actually speak up on his behalf.Ling Han gave a smile, and said, \"This pair of trashes wouldn't be able to concoct such a poison.\"This...!Ling Zhong Kuan and Ling Mu Yun were furious. The reason why they were not suspected was because they were trash and did not have the ability to concoct such a poison? But when compared to being found guilty of the crime of attempting to poison a disciple of Stone Wolf Sect, they still chose to remain silent.\"So, then who's the culprit?\" Ling Dong Xing wore a puzzled expression.Ling Han glanced at Ma Lang, a smile unfolding on his face, and said, \"Brother Ma, do you not intend to explain yourself?\"\"Explain what?\" Ma Lang's face was filled with absolute confusion.Killing intent slowly revealed itself on Ling Dong Xing's face. From Ling Han's words, this poison had actually been placed in their tea by Ma Lang? But the problem was, when had Ma Lang gotten the opportunity to poison their tea? The water in their tea came from their own well, the tea leaves also belonged to their own Ling Clan, and the one who prepared the tea was also one of their own people!If this was known to others outside the clan, they would definitely die of laughter. You couldn't wrong a man like that.But as this was coming from his son's mouth, Ling Dong Xing chose to believe it absolutely.This was the trust that a father had in his son.\"Was is not you, Brother Ma, who had placed the poison?\" Ling Han asked.\"Peng!\"Ma Lang suddenly slammed his hand on the table and stood up from his seat, furiously saying, \"Ling Han, I take you as a friend, yet you wrong me in this way. What is your intention? You say I poisoned your tea? How did I do such a thing? This water, these tea leaves, the servant who prepared the tea all belong to your Ling Clan, so when would I have the chance to do such a thing?\"\"Ling Han, you actually dared to slander a disciple of Stone Wolf Sect, this is definitely unforgivable!\" Ling Zhong Kuan took the opportunity to immediately jump out and shout.Ma Lang's gaze turned to Ling Zhong Kuan, and he said, \"Chief Butler Ling, I suspect this pair of father and son has murdered a fellow disciple of our sect, Hang Zhan. Are you willing to assist me in their arrest?\"Ling Zhong Kuan was immediately very pleased, and said, \"I am willing to listen to Young Master Ma's commands, and be of service to the Stone Wolf Sect!\"\"Very good, you will be responsible for subduing Ling Dong Xing while I shall deal with this brat!\" Ma Lang said while directing a meaningful look at the young man in black.The young man in black nodded slightly, extended a hand into his sleeve and withdrew a jade bottle. He suddenly threw this bottle at the floor, and with a \"pu\" sound, black fumes immediately dissipated everywhere, very rapidly spreading to all the corners of the Main Hall.Poisonous gas?Without waiting for anyone to remind them, everyone held their breaths to avoid breathing the gas in. It was definitely nothing good.\"Hahahaha, I never thought you could actually be so quick-witted,\" Ma Lang revealed a malevolent expression, \"It's true, it was I who had poisoned the water in your well. I never thought you would be so alert. Fortunately, I had already prepared Plan B. Let me introduce someone to you. This is my good friend, Yu Zheng, who holds the nickname of 'Little Poison Lord'.This is Origin Shattering Powder; once you breathe it in, it'll cause the Origin Power within your bodies to stagnate, and you'll become powerless. You won't even have the strength to remain standing.\"Ling Dong Xing naturally felt great fury within his heart, but he could not even expel this anger in a loud rage, for the moment he opened his mouth, he would definitely inhale this Origin Shattering Powder, and that'd be the end.The worst thing was Ling Zhong Kuan was actually still continuing in his attacks on his person, obviously intending to obstruct him here.This old guy's desire to take the position of the Clan Head had already overwhelmed all his logical processes, and was already mad with it. Did he think that once he got rid of Ling Dong Xing, he'd be able to finally take the seat of Clan Head? However, with the way that Ma Lang had shown how ruthless he could be, how was it possible that he would leave any member of the Ling Clan alive?Old fool!Ling Han withdrew a pill bottle from his sleeve. He took out a medicinal pill from it, which he swallowed, then took out another, throwing it to Liu Yu Tong. He took out another, and said to Ling Dong Xing, \"Father, this pill has the effect of curing poison; it can easily deal with the poisonous effects of the Origin Shattering Powder.\"Liu Yu Tong naturally swallowed the pill she had received quickly. Ling Dong Xing slammed a palm attack on Ling Zhong Kuan, and disengaged from the battle, rushing over.Ma Lang made no move to stop them. In his opinion, Ling Han's medicinal pill would be of absolutely no effect.The reason was, every lock had its own key, and every antidote naturally could only cure a specific poison. It was illogical to say that Ling Han had so coincidentally possessed an antidote on hand that could deal with the poison of Origin Shattering Powder. How could he believe such a thing?Haha, then let them believe that this pill would be able to cure their poison. At that moment, they would definitely open their mouths and breathe, thus inhaling the poisonous Origin Shattering Powder. Then, it would be too late for regrets.Ling Dong Xing received the pill and swallowed it in one mouthful. He trusted his son without a doubt. After he had swallowed the pill, he immediately started breathing. Otherwise, he wouldn't be able to continue the battle for too long if he kept holding his breath.The young man in black revealed a mocking smile. He was actually considered half an alchemist, though he had not used his mental capacities on the concoction of alchemical pills. Instead, he mixed various kinds of poisons, researching various methods to use poison to kill.This Origin Shattering Powder was different from those low-grade products on the market. He had added a lot of other poisons to it. It not only had the effects of slowing down the circulation of Origin Power and disintegrating physical strength, it even had the effect of corroding one's internal organs, possessing a terrifying poison....If it was not poisonous, how could he be qualified for the name of 'Little Poison Lord'?Unless it was the antidote that he himself had concocted, there really was no cure for it.Ma Lang too did not rush. After all, Ling Dong Xing was still in the peak period of the ninth layer of Element Gathering Tier and possessed tremendous battle strength. It was too foolish to fight with him head on. As long as he waited for a while longer, Ling Dong Xing would be defeated even without a battle.As the saying goes, a cornered dog will jump over the wall. He had absolutely no intention of entering a life-and-death struggle with the man.Meanwhile, Ling Dong Xing was deeply frowning. Now what?Ma Lang could behave in this deranged manner, but could the Ling Clan bear the risk? Killing a disciple of Stone Wolf Sect, who moreover was in the role of \"imperial envoy\"... this was a huge crime that could lead to the Ling Clan's utter destruction!\"There is nothing to ponder too much about. We are not fish on the chopping board, lying there waiting for others to chop us up!\" Ling Han was much more decisive, as he did not have as much apprehension as Ling Dong Xing. Additionally, he also knew how many trump cards he could make use of....Chen Feng Lie, Zhu He Xin, as well as the Liu Clan of the Imperial City that was behind Liu Yu Tong.Ling Dong Xing too quickly made his decision. He did not possess an indecisive character, and his killing intent immediately surfaced.\"En?\"Meanwhile, Ma Lang and Yu Zheng both assumed a very strange expression, wondering why was it that Ling Dong Xing and the rest had not yet revealed the symptoms of succumbing to the poison? After all, they should already manifest by now.Could it be... that the pill that they had taken earlier had really cured their poison?\"Ah!\" At this moment, Ling Zhong Kuan screamed in agony, suddenly falling to the ground. His four limbs were twitching and his face was twisting. He was obviously in unbearable agony. Ling Mu Yun was in the same condition. He too had collapsed on the ground in uncontrollable spasms.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This Origin Shattering Powder not only disintegrated his Origin Power, it also weakened him. It also had extremely powerful poisonous effects, corroding his internal organs and causing him to moan in excruciating agony.Who knew if he was saying these words to Ling Han or Ma Lang, or perhaps he could be saying it to both of them.But Ling Mu Yun could no longer say a word, and could only create a \"ke ke ke\" sound with his throat. His whole body was covered in cold sweat, the agony he was feeling had to be beyond description.Ma Lang and Yu Zheng did not spare these two men any attention. They only kept staring at Ling Han in shock. Obviously, this brat's pill really had the ability to cure their poison. But the question was, how could there be such a coincidence in this world--that his pill would so coincidentally be an antidote to the Origin Shattering Powder?Or did that mean the pill this brat had contained the ability to cure multiple types of poisons?\"You reap what you sow!\" Ling Han humphed coldly, without any slightest bit of mercy. He turned towards Ma Lang and said, \"Father, how about you deal with that whatever 'Little Poison Lord', while I handle this guy?\"\"Are you sure?\" Ling Dong Xing was slightly worried. After all, Ma Lang was in the sixth layer of Element Gathering Tier, and thus much stronger than his son, who had just entered the Element Gathering Tier.\"Don't worry, Father,\" Ling Han put on a confident smile.\"Heng, where is the law enforcement team?\" Ma Lang gave a loud shout. As things had already proceeded to this step, he could only use force.\"Shua shua shua,\" more than ten people dressed in black flew in from outside the Main Hall, each and every one of them exuding a powerful killing intent.\"Aside from this brat and that woman, execute all the others!\" Ma Lang said loudly. He knew that Ling Dong Xing was in the ninth layer of Element Gathering Tier, and possessed tremendous battle strength. However, he possessed the advantage in numbers, so there was still a chance of emerging victorious.\"Understood!\" All the black-clad people answered coldly. They drew their respective weapons and aimed them at Ling Dong Xing.Ling Dong Xing did not feel any fear. He was in the ninth layer of Element Gathering Tier, so how could he be overwhelmed by a few low-layer Element Gathering Tier martial artists whose only advantage was in numbers? He gave a long hiss and charged towards the black-uniformed group.Ma Lang did not interfere. Instead, he started to circle around Ling Han and said, \"I have to admit that you surprised me by actually having a pill that could cure the poison especially concocted by Little Poison Lord. I think you must have gotten your hands on an ancient treasure trove, one that not only contained valuable pills that could help a martial artist increase his cultivation rate greatly, but also high level medicinal pills that could cure all poisons. Otherwise, your cultivation level would not have progressed so quickly. You wouldn't have been able to be completely unscathed either under the influence of the Origin Shattering Powder.However, all this now belongs to me!\" He turned a gaze overflowing with greed at Ling Han.But Ling Han only responded with a smile, and said, \"The only thing you can get is... death!\"\"Damn you!\" Ma Lang cursed, and threw himself at Ling Han. He wanted to subdue Ling Han in order to force Ling Dong Xing to surrender.Ling Han was naturally unafraid. With a \"ding,\" he drew his sword from the scabbard. Then, he threw the scabbard to the side and raised his sword in a slash, displaying Sword Qi.\"What, Sword Qi?!\" Ma Lang gasped in shock. He immediately retreated, and could not help the deep frown crossing his brow. He looked at Ling Han, and said, \"I never thought that you would have actually managed to form Sword Qi! You were initially a trash, yet now you have even managed to form Sword Qi. I am now really more and more expectant... the treasure trove that you had obtained must be of absolutely astonishing value!Now, I need to display some of my true abilities.\" He withdrew a bent saber from his waist, brandished it a few times, and actually displayed a flash of Saber Qi too. He revealed an arrogant expression, \"You're not the only one who can form 'Qi'!\"Those who could form \"Qi\" had the right to be proud of themselves.Ling Han shook his head, and said impatiently, \"How long are you intending to keep chattering for?\"\"Heng, you will regret saying these words!\" Ma Lang threw himself up, the bent saber in his hand drawn. \"Xiu xiu,\" a flash of Saber Qi danced. It seemed as if he had struck twice in one instant. Together with the power he had as a martial artist in the sixth layer of Element Gathering Tier, the power behind his blows was truly terrifying.Liu Yu Tong could not help her hands clenching into fists, revealing an anxious expression.She knew that Ling Han was very powerful, but Ma Lang was not Hang Zhan. Ma Lang was in the sixth layer of Element Gathering Tier, which was five whole layers above Ling Han. In her opinion, this gap was not something that could be compensated by martial arts techniques or experience.But Ling Han looked so confident that she could not bear to stop him. She could only worry from the side, wanting nothing more than to fight in his place.Ling Han gave a humph. His long sword once again slashed and two flashes of Sword Qi rolled out.\"Two flashes of Sword Qi!\" Ma Lang's eyes were about to pop out of his skull at this. What kind of terrifying comprehension level was this? But he immediately snorted coldly in his heart. So what if Ling Han could form two flashes of Sword Qi? He was a martial artist in the sixth layer of Element Gathering Tier, and possessed an overwhelming power advantage. This was definitely not something an additional flash of Sword Qi could overcome.The saber he had raised did not change in position, and mercilessly struck down on Ling Han.\"Ting!\"The saber and the sword clashed, suddenly producing fiery sparks due to the friction between the two blades. Sword Qi and Saber Qi clashed as well, but they canceled each other out. However, there was still an additional flash of Sword Qi that continued on its path towards Ma Lang.\"Pu, pu,\" blood blossomed suddenly on Ma Lang's chest. He stumbled backwards, his face filled with disbelief.\"You have just entered into Element Gathering Tier, but how is it possible that you have such tremendous power?\" He gasped in shock. When their blows clashed, he managed to estimate that his opponent's power belonged to someone in about the fifth layer of Element Gathering Tier.To get from the second layer of Body Refining Tier to the fifth layer of Element Gathering Tier in a short two months?This was something that Ma Lang could not accept in the slightest.\"Because I am a genius!\" Ling Han brandished his sword, continuing his attack.Ma Lang gritted his teeth. The word \"genius\" was something that he frequently used, and now it was snatched by someone else. He was naturally very displeased at this. Yet his opponent, at the mere age of sixteen, had already managed to break through to Element Gathering Tier, and even succeeded in forming two flashes of Sword Qi! Ling Han really did deserve the name of \"genius\"!\"Damn it!\" He did not believe in the slightest that a piece of trash had suddenly attained enlightenment. It must be because Ling Han had obtained that mysterious treasure trove that allowed an idiot to become a genius.This caused his desire to obtain it for himself to soar even higher.\"This is mine! Mine!\" His eyes had turned red, jealousy turning him mad.\"Xiu,\" he pounced with his bent saber slashing out, and a bright flash of blood red flickered.\"Scarlet Trained Kill!\" he shouted loudly. This was his ultimate technique and was also one of the secret techniques of Stone Wolf Sect that could never be taught to others. It was a high level Yellow Grade technique!If he had not been the favorite disciple of Seventh Elder, he would never have been taught this saber technique while he was still in Element Gathering Tier, as this was a secret technique that could only be used by the Elders--in Stone Wolf Sect, high level Yellow Grade martial arts techniques were the best secret techniques they had, and according to rumors, only the Sect Master had the right to cultivate their one and only Black Grade martial arts technique.Stone Wolf Claws, a low level Black Grade martial arts technique. It was also the origin of the Stone Wolf Sect's name.The saber's light was bitingly cold, and the flash of Saber Qi, as well as the real saber, had become crimson and struck towards Ling Han from two different directions. [1]Ling Han drew his sword, and used the Shocking Electricity Sword Arts. The two flashes of Sword Qi danced together, and were not the slightest bit less grand. Against a mere Ma Lang, he still did not need to put in all his effort and use all four flashes of Sword Qi.\"Ting ting ting ting,\" the saber and sword clashed repeatedly. The power advantage Ling Han had with the additional flash of Sword Qi was very obvious. Every time they exchanged blows, Ma Lang would definitely be struck by a flash of Sword Qi, causing wounds to continuously appear on his body.Ma Lang was both astonished and alarmed. If things continued this way, Ling Han would slowly wear him down.\"Yu Zheng, help me!\" he shouted loudly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Helping you deal with this brat... does not seem to be a part of our agreement,\" Yu Zheng said slowly, as if he had not seen that Ma Lang was suffering.Ma Lang knew that Yu Zheng was also a greedy man; he was no longer interested in the benefits he had promised him previously. Though he was reluctant, he could only say, \"This brat must have discovered some kind of ancient secret trove to be able to progress from the second layer of Body Refining Tier to Element Gathering Tier within a short two months. He has even managed to form two flashes of Sword Qi. Just think, how very valuable would this treasure trove be? Let us join forces to force this brat to reveal this treasure trove, and we'll split the contents between the both of us equally! Our future prospects would be beyond measure!\"Yu Zheng had only known that Ling Han was an extraordinary young man, but he had never imagined that this guy had been so weak in the past. With such a colossal discrepancy between his past and present, it could only be explained by the fact that he had obtained some kind of ancient treasure trove.Even a piece of trash could obtain such a complete transformation, then what if it was he who had obtained this kind of treasure trove?His breathing became harsh, and killing intent revealed itself in his eyes. His killing intent was even directed towards Ma Lang as well. As long as he managed to obtain that treasure trove from Ling Han, he would definitely kill Ma Lang to keep things quiet.\"Very well, I shall help you!\" As he said so, he removed the bundle he had been carrying on his back. From within he withdrew two daggers. There was a greenish light flickering from the sharp blades of the daggers. They had been dipped in powerful poison.\"Yu Tong, get rid of him!\" Ling Han said casually.\"Understood!\" Liu Yu Tong replied. Xiu, her figure flew forwards, making her seem like a descending deity.Too fast!In a flash, she had already appeared behind Yu Zheng. Her right hand forced his hand up, and Yu Zheng could not control the brandishing of the dagger he had been holding, which drew against his throat.\"Pu!\"Blood splattered, and Yu Zheng stumbled back. He used one hand to press onto the wound on his throat as the other frantically searched through his sleeve for the antidote. But his face quickly turned black, and when he finally drew out a jade bottle from his sleeve, his eyes had already lost all signs of life.\"Peng,\" he collapsed with his head raised. Till his final moment, he still could not manage to believe that he would actually die here, and furthermore, that such a divinely beautiful, cold as ice maiden would actually have such great power that he had not even managed to display a single technique before death.Ma Lang was extremely shocked as well. He too had not imagined that Liu Yu Tong would be so powerful, and even be able to instantly kill Yu Zheng, a martial artist in the fourth layer of Element Gathering Tier, in one move.Such a genius, why was she willing to lower herself to stay by Ling Han's side?\"You still dare to be distracted at such a time, are you complaining that death is not coming fast enough?\" Ling Han smiled coldly, and brandished his sword in a killing move.Ma Lang raised his saber to parry in panic, yet was still forced to retreat about seven or eight steps by the shockwave from this move. Another wound appeared on his body.\"Let me see you off!\" Ling Han brandished his sword once again, like a rainbow piercing through the day, presenting a dazzling image. [ED/N: Day or sun, quite ambiguous; day is more likely though]This was the strongest move of Shocking Electricity Sword Arts, named Flash Strike!Ma Lang gritted his teeth and raised his saber in a parry. But the saber missed, and with a \"pu\", he only managed to feel a sharp pain in his chest. His heart had been pierced through by the long sword, and the terrifying shockwave generated by this attack immediately exploded his heart.Martial artists in the Element Gathering Tier had a strong vitality. Even though his heart had been exploded, he was not completely dead yet. He kept staring at Ling Han and his mouth opened and closed a few times, as if wanting to say something, yet he did not manage to produce any sound at all.\"After such a long battle, how could it be that I have not managed to seen through your moves?\" Ling Han knew what Ma Lang wanted to ask, and replied calmly.'You're a damn monster, we've only battled just a short while, and you've actually seen through my moves?'Ma Lang was spitting out curses in his heart, and he finally breathed his last, unwillingly closing his eyes in death.Ling Han withdrew his sword, and glanced over the scene. Ling Dong Xing had dealt with majority of the law enforcers, and even if any of them were so fortunate as to get away from him, Liu Yu Tong would immediately deal with these leftovers.Meanwhile, Ling Zhong Kuan and his grandson, Ling Mu Yun, had also died under the powerful effects of the poison. Their eyes were fixed in a stare, filled with a powerful rage, though who knew who was it they hated the most--Ma Lang and Yu Zheng or Ling Dong Xing and his son.\"These two traitors, they've gotten off lightly!\" Ling Han humphed. He had initially intended to kill the two of them himself.\"It's fine, they are, after all, clansmen of the Ling Clan. Dying in the hands of outsiders is good,\" Ling Dong Xing only sighed. He was, after all, the Clan Head, and so there were many more things he needed to consider.They naturally need not deal with the bodies themselves. However, killing someone was easy, but dealing with the aftermath... Ling Dong Xing had a bit of a headache at this.\"Han'er, you and Yu Tong must immediately leave, go as far away as you can!\" Ling Dong Xing had decided. He could remain behind and die with the Ling Clan, but his son was the hope of the clan. At the very least, he needed to ensure that Ling Han remained safe.Ling Han smiled, and said, \"Father, I had not done this act out of impulsiveness. We can let Chen Feng Lie deal with this issue.\"\"So many people have died, and there's even a disciple of Seventh Elder. Can he really solve the issue?\" Ling Dong Xing asked, frowning.\"For the sake of his own life, he would definitely do all he can,\" Ling Han laughed. \"Moreover, Yu Tong is the princess of the Liu Clan, one of the Eight Great Clans of the imperial city. If worst comes to worst, we can reveal her identity.\"Yet Ling Dong Xing still shook his head. He naturally thought of his son as the best young man in the whole world, but would the Liu Clan think the same? When he recalled that his own wife was also the great granddaughter of the Third Elder of Winter Moon Sect, yet in the end, their conclusion was tragic... there was already a previous example.Still, they really are real father and son, even the women they got to know were of such high, noble status.He could not help feeling a little worried. As a father, he did not hope in the slightest for Ling Han to follow in his footsteps.\"Right, Yu Tong?\" Ling Han had never been a father, so he would not be able to understand Ling Dong Xing's current thoughts. He saw how Ling Dong Xing still looked very worried, and misunderstood his father was still worrying about the issue of Stone Wolf Sect, so he asked Liu Yu Tong for assurance.\"En!\" Liu Yu Tong nodded, her expression extremely solemn.When Ling Dong Xing saw this, as someone who has had previous experience, how could he not be able to tell that Liu Yu Tong had already developed feelings for his son?Hopefully this will not be another pair of star-crossed lovers! No, this will definitely not be an ill-fated romance, his son was better than him by a hundred, a thousand times, and in the future, he'd definitely be able to exceed the limitations of martial arts of Rain Country. So what would be inappropriate in marrying the daughter of one of the Eight Great Clans?Ling Han immediately wrote a missive, and had a messenger deliver it at full speed to Stone Wolf Sect, addressed to Chen Feng Lie. If Chen Feng Lie was unable to deal with this matter, then he actually had an alternative solution, and that was Zhu He Xin. Zhu He Xin was a low-level Black Grade alchemist. Although he did not have a very high opinion of him, but within Rain Country, Zhu He Xin possessed quite a high status. At least he was someone that the Stone Wolf Sect definitely did not dare to trifle with....Liu Yu Tong was his little female attendant. It would be very embarrassing to be forced to make use of her background.Chen Feng Lie received the letter on the third day. When he had finished reading the contents of the letter, he had almost been shocked to the point of heart attack, thinking how was it that this young master could be such a troublemaker? He had just killed off one Cheng Xiao Yuan, and now he's also killed Ma Lang and a whole law enforcement team.Cheng Xiao Yuan was fine. He was Chen Feng Lie's disciple, and so what if he's dead? It's fine as long as Chen Feng Lie did not intend to pursue matters. But Ma Lang was Old Seventh's disciple, and was also the most excellent one of them. How could he bury this pit?But he had no choice but to do it, for his life was tied to Ling Han.Ling Han did not know how Chen Feng Lie had dealt with the issue. He only knew that two days later, the latter replied to his message and said that there was no longer any need to worry about anything.Since this matter was already resolved, Ling Han decided to enter Seven Wind Mountains. There was still one month before the end of the year, and he needed to achieve at least the fourth layer of Element Gathering Tier to have a chance to compete for the first place in the Da Yuan Tournament.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 46": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Alchemy Emperor of the Divine DaoCH 46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe Seven Wind Mountains encompassed a very wide area. From east to west, they spanned close to a thousand miles, while from south to north, they covered close to four hundred miles. It was the largest mountain range in the northern region of Rain Country. There were many demonic beasts inhabiting the mountain range, and there was also a large variety of different Spiritual Medicine growing here. Sometimes, some precious metals that could be used to forge high-grade weapons were also discovered here. As a result, there were many who entered here for training trips, as well as many whose target were the numerous treasures in this place. However, the annual death toll amongst those who entered the mountains here was also very high.Some died under the fangs of demonic beasts. Some died because of some dangerous environment they found themselves in, while there were also some who were killed by their fellow human beings.Although no one had actually counted the numbers, most believed over half of the deaths that occurred in Seven Wind Mountains was due to being murdered by other humans. Therefore, the most dangerous existence within Seven Wind Mountains was not any kind of demonic beast, but man.A day later, Ling Han and Liu Yu Tong arrived at Yellow Bridge Town. From here, they could directly enter the mountain range.Because the journey this time round was quite far, they had traveled here on horseback. The two of them stayed one night in an inn in the town, and subsequently left their horses at that inn before setting out towards the mountain range with only a simple bundle on their backs....If they were unable to return within a month, then the inn had the right to sell off their horses. The money earned from the sale would cover the payment to the inn for holding onto their horses for a month.The early morning sun hung high in the sky, its rays shining on the still remaining dewdrops, reflecting a variety of exceptionally beautiful colors and thus presenting a scene full of life. This was a wild, primitive, colossal mountain range. Although there were many people exploring the depths of the mountain range every single day, compared to this gigantic mountain range, the large number of visitors was really insignificant.As Ling Han and Liu Yu Tong breathed in the fresh air around them, they both experienced an indefinable sense of relaxation.They traveled all over the mountain range in search of the rock cave that had been mentioned in the rumors. However, they had searched for five days, and although they did find many caves, all the caves they found only led to disappointment.That was reasonable, though--if that cave could be so easily found, then wouldn't it have long been discovered by others?'En?'Ling Han's steps suddenly paused. He heard some sounds of battle.\"Let's go take a look,\" he said. This was his second life yet he still could not change his curious nature.They followed the sounds and quickly arrived at the bank of a little brook. In the clearing some distance in front of them, there were two groups of people who were currently engaged in a deadly battle.\"This is really a small world!\" Ling Han shook his head. He knew one of the parties that were currently fighting....They were Liu Dong, Chen Peng Ju, Zhu Xue Yi and the others. They had joined forces previously at Balance Mountain to obtain the Green Spiritual Fruit. However, as Hang Zhan's incident happened soon after, the five of them were also scared off. He never thought he would see them again here.Out of the group of five, Liu Dong, Li Hao and Zhu Xue Yi had all broken through to Element Gathering Tier while Chen Peng Ju and Zhou Chang had also progressed to the ninth layer of Body Refining Tier. Their improvement was very evident.After all, they had each respectively gotten one Green Spiritual Fruit.Yet, though their side had three elite martial artists in Element Gathering Tier, they were still at a disadvantage as the other side had four martial artists in Element Gathering Tier.Three against four--they were at a disadvantage in numbers; added to the fact that they had just broken through to Element Gathering Tier and thus their power was still quite weak... if it was not for the fact that their opponents seemed to want to capture them alive, they would have long been finished.\"Why won't you quickly surrender to avoid suffering too much?\" One of their opponents said. There were four members in the other party, and all of them possessed a fierce look to them. It was obvious that they have had a lot of experience in this area, and were filled with killing intent.Liu Dong and his group made no answer, but continued to keep up their defenses.In the past, the strongest one of the group of five was Li Hao. It was no different now. He brandished his saber repeatedly, every wave undaunted by the gap in power between the two groups. Each slash of his saber had an air of determination to it. It was also thanks to his presence that the group of five managed to hold on until now.Yet he had also attracted the concentrated attention of two of their opponents. \"Pu pu,\" with two powerful blows, two wounds appeared on his chest and back respectively, and blood splattered.Li Hao gave a loud roar and his eyes turned blood red, revealing an increasingly maniacal air, as if there was something about to explode from within him.Ling Han could not help exclaiming softly in surprise.\"What is it?\" Liu Yu Tong asked. A battle at this level naturally did not deserve her full attention.\"That guy is really quite talented, he's almost able to form Saber Qi,\" Ling Han said, pointing at Li Hao.\"Saber Qi!\" Liu Yu Tong could not help being shocked. Whatever \"Qi\" it was, this kind of power was very difficult to form. However, it was common sense for many elite martial artists that under extreme emotional pressure, it would be much easier to form \"Qi\".For example extreme joy or grief, or perhaps endless slaughter, or maybe the depths of despair. However, she had always possessed an icy demeanor, so she had never experienced such extremes of the emotional spectrum. As a result, she has not managed to form Sword Qi....According to her knowledge, that elder in her clan had managed to form Sword Qi due to the great grief he experienced after his wife had died of an illness.Now Li Hao had actually reached the point where he was close to forming Saber Qi. So how could she not be both shocked and envious?Ling Han smiled, and said, \"You don't have to be discouraged. With my careful guidance, you too will very quickly be able to form Sword Qi. This isn't anything difficult!\" To him, the difficulty was in forming Sword Point, while grasping Sword Heart was the real challenge.Isn't anything difficult?Liu Yu Tong almost rolled her eyes in response. In the whole of Rain Country, how many people had actually managed to form \"Qi\"? Even in her Liu Clan, there were only seven clansmen who had managed such a feat!Ling Han smiled. This girl naturally had no idea how colossal the East Star was. The strongest warriors of Rain Country were possibly only in Flower Blossom Tier... Rain Country could be considered a \"backwater place\".In the wider world, there were innumerable geniuses. There would definitely be no small number of those who had managed to form \"Point\", and even \"Heart\".\"Are you not going to help them?\" Liu Yu Tong could not hold back from asking.\"This is that guy's rare opportunity. If he is unable to form Saber Qi through this experience, then the next time he gets this kind of chance will be maybe five years, or even ten years later,\" Ling Han said, shaking his head. \"Let him face a bit more pressure.\"Liu Yu Tong frowned slightly. She did not have such an optimistic opinion of Li Hao. It was possible for him to be killed at any moment under the violent, relentless attacks of the enemies rather than form Saber Qi.\"Don't underestimate the will and determination of human beings. Under extreme pressure, there is a possibility one will erupt with inconceivable power!\" Ling Han smiled. He could not help remembering that in his last life, he had really been overprotected. Concocting and taking medicine allowed him to easily progress through the tiers.It was when he started to travel all over the world in search of ancient sites that he realized that he had such a weak grasp of his own actual battle prowess. The dangers and perils of all the ancient sites he visited also managed to forge his strong determination and willpower, as well as increase his combat experience.It was only from then onwards that he could really be considered as a powerful warrior.\"Shua!\"A bright flash of the saber streaked across the air, as if proving Ling Han's words. Li Hao, who had initially been forced into a dangerous corner, actually displayed a surprising saber skill. What was even more surprising was that there was actually an accompanying flash at the same time the saber was brandished. It looked as if he had brandished two sabers at the same time.He had not brandished two sabers. The second flash of saber was.... Saber Qi!\"Pu!\"None of those fighting could've imagined that Li Hao would have been able to display a flash of Saber Qi. One of his opponents had received the blow, and as the Saber Qi streaked across, blood immediately spilled from a wound on the other's left shoulder.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 47": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Alchemy Emperor of the Divine DaoCH 47Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"Good!\" The morale of Liu Dong and the other three was uplifted by this strike, yet Li Hao's figure staggered. His Origin Power had long neared the point of complete exhaustion. This last slash was, in reality, merely his despair and rage he unleashed. He had never imagined that he would actually form Saber Qi in this attack.But he was no longer able to continue the battle. His right hand dropped to his side, and the saber almost slipped from his fingers.\"Boss, this brat can actually form Saber Qi, we definitely can't let him live!\" One of the enemies immediately shouted.The boss of these four people was a large man with deep brows who had two missing fingers on his left hand. He nodded and said, \"This brat will become a big trouble for us in future. Just kill him then. We'll just have less money to extort.\"\"Hehe, just add a little bit more extortion money for the other four cash cows. It should be enough to cover for this guy's share.\"\"Maybe his corpse would be worth a few coins.\"The four of them talked amongst themselves. Although they had initially been shocked by the flash of Saber Qi Li Hao had revealed, they very quickly regained their composure. After all, in this battle, they possessed an absolute advantage in terms of power.\"Flee, I'll cover your retreat, guys!\" Li Hao said deeply, using all his strength to raise the saber he was still holding, his gaze determined.\"Tsk, tsk, tsk... the power of love is truly great,\" Ling Han clicked his tongue in praise. From their previous encounter, he could already tell that Li Hao liked Zhu Xue Yi. The reason he had been able to form a flash of Saber Qi just now... it likely was because he was worried that the object of his feelings would be hurt and suffer, leading to an extreme emotional upheaval.Of course, extreme emotional upheavals were not a requirement for forming \"Qi\". However, under such conditions, humans are often able to fully realize their potential, thus some who had enough talent would be able to form \"Qi\".\"Now, can you make your move?\" Liu Yu Tong rolled her eyes at him again. She kept feeling that this guy's actions were always much too mature, not a bit like those of a typical sixteen-year-old.Ling Han gave a long whistle, and leaped out.\"Ling Han!\" When Liu Dong and his group saw him, their expressions were first of joy, yet quickly followed by disappointment. It was because, during their past encounter, Ling Han had only been in the seventh layer of Body Refining Tier. From then until now, only two months had passed--how could it be possible that Ling Han had broken through to Element Gathering Tier within a brief two months' period?If that was so, then even if he was now in the ninth layer of Body Refining Tier, he would still be unable to battle with a martial artist in the first layer of Element Gathering Tier on even terms. This was the ironclad rule of martial arts.They looked around once again, hoping to discover another's figure--Liu Yu Tong was an elite martial artist in the ninth layer of Element Gathering Tier. If she was here, then they'd all be saved.\"Ai!\" Ling Han gave a deliberate sigh, and said, \"The looks on your faces now make me very sad!\"\"Brat, who do you think you are?\" The enemies' boss that had missing fingers shouted at Ling Han. His gaze was wavering as he did not know Ling Han's prowess, but judging from the fact that Ling Han only seemed to be about sixteen or seventeen years old, there was no way that he would be too powerful, right?\"I'm Ling Han, son of the Ling Clan's Clan Head from Gray Cloud Town,\" Ling Han introduced himself.\"Boss, we've got another cash cow here!\" One of the lackeys said.The boss with missing fingers laughed wickedly. In his opinion, Ling Han had to be one of those spoiled young masters who had an exaggerated idea of their own abilities and no idea of the perils of the real world! Thinking in this manner, he naturally would not take Ling Han seriously, and said, \"You brat are really quite nice to especially deliver money to us, why don't you quickly come here and surrender obediently?\"\"Hahahaha!\" His group of four laughed raucously.Ling Han was all smiles, and said, \"I don't think the four of you are nice at all, why don't you obediently extend your necks and I'll gift each one of you with a slash?\"\"What a self-important brat, the kind of person I hate the most is this type of spoiled young master!\" One of the lackeys pounced at Ling Han while brandishing a large cleaver in a slash aimed at Ling Han's head.\"Old Four, don't be too merciless, that's a cash cow there!\" The boss with missing fingers reminded.\"Hehe, I'm just going to cut off this brat's arms,\" Old Four said, and when the large cleaver lowered, the blade came down at a slight angle and, indeed, it was aiming at Ling Han's arm.Ling Han drew his sword. \"Xiu,\" the sword flashed, and the cleaver flew high up into the air while that man called Old Four was also forced to fly backwards due to the shockwave from Ling Han's parry. But he had just flown back some distance when his head separated from his neck, and a gushing stream of hot blood sprayed out.\"What!\"Seeing this, the other three bandits were dumbstruck. Liu Dong and his group were also shocked numb.Was this really Ling Han?Two months ago, this guy was just in the seventh layer of Body Refining Tier, yet now? That Old Four had to be at least in the second layer, or even third, of Element Gathering Tier and his individual strength could overwhelm them easily. Yet he was killed in one strike by Ling Han... what kind of disparity was that?Since Ling Han had drawn his sword, there was no way he would be merciful. His figure moved sharply and charged towards the boss with missing fingers and his two other fellows.\"Old Four must have been too careless!\"\"That's right, he's just a little brat, how strong could he be!\"\"Let's kill him to avenge Old Four!\"The three of them pounced while brandishing their respective weapons, and as their blades waved about wildly, they created a big commotion.Unfortunately, in front of Ling Han, they were all much too weak.Out of the group of three, aside from their boss with missing fingers who was in the third layer of Element Gathering Tier, the other two were both in the second layer. In front of Ling Han whose prowess was comparable to that of a martial artist in the fifth layer of Element Gathering Tier, what could they do? This was the constraint of a difference in stages. Any martial artist would know very well how big the gulf between the power of one stage and the next one was. [1]Ling Han didn't even have to use Sword Qi; he did not need to use Shocking Electricity Sword Arts either. Taking all opportunities provided by the gaps in their defenses, 'shua shua shua,\" he instantly killed them--one bandit with each strike. The boss with missing fingers didn't even get a chance to beg for mercy before the whole group was completely obliterated by Ling Han.Liu Dong and his group felt like they were dreaming.They exhausted all means available and only managed to survive for over half a day against the boss with missing fingers and his lackeys--and that was mostly due to the fact that they had wanted to capture Liu Dong and his group alive for extortion! But what did Ling Han do? He killed them, one enemy with one strike, as if it was a piece of cake.In the past, there indeed had already been a gap between their battle prowess, but how could it have become so colossal?\"Ling Han, no, Big Brother Ling, thank you!\"\"It's really thanks to you, otherwise, we would have been in deep trouble!\"They were stunned for a moment before hurriedly gathering around Ling Han to thank him.Ling Han smiled and exchanged pleasantries with them. Liu Yu Tong also came out from behind the bushes, and the atmosphere quickly became lively.\"Why are you guys here?\" Ling Han asked. This Seven Wind Mountains was extremely dangerous. If it wasn't for the fact that there was Earth Dragon Grass and a Red Scaled Dragon Snake here, he wouldn't even consider coming to this place. After all, who could guarantee that the demonic beasts in Spiritual Ocean Tier wouldn't suddenly feel like taking a walk around the territories of weak demonic beasts?\"The Da Yuan Tournament is going to begin very soon and so we wanted to do as much as we could to increase our individual abilities. We came here to see if we might be lucky enough to pick some spiritual medicine growing all over the place here,\" Chen Peng Ju said.Ling Han could not hold back a loud laugh and said, \"Are you guys perhaps thinking that just because you discovered a plant of Green Spiritual Fruits back at Balance Mountain, the heavens are looking favorably on you and you'd also be able to get a large haul here?\"Liu Dong and his group looked embarrassed. Zhu Xue Yi pouted, and said, \"Don't remind us. We are really very unlucky this time. Not only did we not find any spiritual medicine, we had even accidentally fallen into a cave that had heavy Yin Qi; there were bones, human and animal alike, littered all over the place.\"Ling Han started. It couldn't be that these five guys had coincidentally fallen into the cave the Red Scaled Dragon Snake inhabited, right?If that was true, then their luck was indeed extraordinarily good!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 48": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Alchemy Emperor of the Divine DaoCH 48Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"Where is that cave?\" Ling Han asked.\"Wait, you want to go to that demonic place?!\" Liu Dong immediately shouted.Ling Han smiled softly and said, \"Aren't you guys here to search for a fateful encounter? There could be one at that place. Oh, that's right, you guys probably didn't venture too deeply into that cave, right?\"\"Of course not. There were bones all over the place. It looked like a mass grave. Once we saw it, we fled,\" as a girl, Zhu Xue Yi naturally need not fear that saying such words would make Ling Han laugh at them.\"You guys are really fortunate,\" Ling Han nodded. Had these guys been even slightly more curious and ventured deeper into the cave to see what kind of creature had devoured these people and animals, they would've very likely never come out.\"Is there really a great opportunity there?\" Cheng Peng Ju asked a bit expectantly. Currently, only he and Zhou Chang had not yet broken through to Element Gathering Tier.\"Possibly,\" Ling Han nodded. That cave could be the lair of the Red Scaled Dragon Snake, or possibly some other kind of savage demonic beast. As he had not yet seen it with his own eyes, it was difficult to make an accurate guess.When he saw the eagerness displayed on the faces of the five of them, he said, \"However, great opportunities usually go hand in hand with great danger. You guys need to think it over carefully.\"The four of them exchanged looks and, after a while, they finally said, \"We'll at least take you to that cave for now.\"The group set off on their path, and Ling Han said to Li Hao, \"Congratulations, now that you've formed Saber Qi, you can be considered to have finally stepped onto the first step of the path of a saber wielder.\"Saber Qi!When Ling Han said this, Liu Dong and the others were reminded that Li Hao's last attack had actually managed to form a flash of Saber Qi. Liu Dong, Chen Peng Ju and Zhou Chang were uncontrollably envious, while Zhu Xue Yi's face was filled with joy.Li Hao laughed in a simple manner. Before he had even begun his path of cultivation, he had already been practicing saber skills. He had immersed himself in the path of the saber for thirteen years, and his deepest desire was to be able to form Saber Qi. Unfortunately, he had never managed to do so.He had never thought that this would have been a blessing in disguise, allowing him to form Saber Qi in such dangerous circumstances. From now onwards, his path of martial arts would definitely be bright beyond imagination!It could even be said that even if he went to Hu Yang Academy and showed off his Saber Qi there, he'd definitely be gladly welcomed as a disciple.\"Big Brother Ling, let's have a spar!\" Li Hao could not help feeling his fighting spirit rise, \"However, you're not allowed to use your full abilities. Otherwise, your power would be much too strong.\"Ling Han neither agreed nor rejected. He simply drew his sword and gave it a light wave.\"Shua,\" two flashes of Sword Qi appeared in a dance.Li Hao instantly opened his mouth in a daze. After a while, he finally shook his head and said, \"I'll never compare myself with a freak like you again!\"\"That's right, this guy is a true freak!\"\"To compare yourself with him is practically looking for trouble!\"Liu Dong and the other three said respectively, all of them completely convinced by Ling Han's absolute prowess.Yet Ling Han was not so easily satisfied. Sword Qi was only the first step on the path of the sword; there was still Sword Point and Sword Heart after that! In his last life, out of the seven ultimate warriors of Heaven Tier, one of them had been the most esteemed existence of sword arts. He began practicing with the sword at seven years old, forming Sword Qi at ten, forming Sword Heart when he was seventeen, and finally forming Sword Heart at the age of thirty-three. He was truly a grandmaster of sword arts.His first life was done and over with. He had placed all his attention on the path of alchemy, and became an Alchemy Emperor, someone who had never appeared in the books of history and likely never would again. He was a competitive man. Since he had already decided to concentrate on the path of martial arts in this life, then he wanted to also become a true emperor of martial arts.Da Yuan City was too small, and Rain Country itself was also too small, thus even those who had only managed to form Sword or Saber Qi would be praised as exceptional geniuses.They were not too far away from that cave. Thus, after half an hour, they arrived at the face of a cliff, which was covered with damp moss. Because the cliff was facing away from light, they appeared to look dark-green in color.\"It's there!\" Zhu Xue Yi said, pointing at one corner of the cliff.Ling Han glanced over and saw that there was a very inconspicuous cave entrance there. If Zhu Xue Yi had not deliberately pointed it out to him, he would have definitely missed it.\"You guys wait here, I'll go take a look.\" He took a great leap and entered into the cave.The environment here was extremely damp, and the ground slippery. If he wasn't careful, he might slip and slide all the way to the bottom of the cave. He cautiously advanced, observing his surroundings carefully and paying attention to any traces or clues.Soon he arrived at the bottom of the cave and discovered a gigantic cavern. There were bones everywhere, and just as Zhu Xue Yi had described, they were bones of both humans and demonic beasts. They were giving out a rotting stench.If anyone else had seen such a scene, he'd probably turn right around and flee back to wherever he came from.Ling Han searched carefully and soon, among the pile of bones, discovered a crimson scale.\"It's indeed the Red Scaled Dragon Snake!\" He could finally confirm it. He began searching again and eventually discovered a passage at one of the corners of the cavern. The passage's ceiling was only as tall as a normal man's height and it was also only wide enough to permit one person to enter at a time. A more powerful rotting stench was continuously wafting from within it.\"That big guy should be sleeping inside,\" Ling Han took a look at the scale in his hand; judging from its size, it definitely came from a mature Red Scaled Dragon Snake. He bent it, but the scale did not split in half.\"Indeed, Red Scaled Dragon Snake has a thread of dragon blood in their line. That's why their scales would be so tough. Otherwise, demonic beasts in Element Gathering Tier definitely could not possess such a powerful defense.\"He retreated out of the cave, brought Liu Dong and the others to a place farther away and said, \"That cave is the lair of the Red Scaled Dragon Snake.\"\"Red Scaled Dragon Snake!\" Liu Dong and his group were shocked. The Red Scaled Dragon Snake was a demonic beast in the ninth layer of Element Gathering Tier. Furthermore, it was much stronger than any ordinary demonic beast in the ninth layer of Element Gathering Tier. It definitely deserved the name of the Beast King amongst demonic beasts of Element Gathering Tier.\"The inner core of the Dragon Snake can be used to concoct Transcending Origin Pill--one pill will allow the user to increase his own cultivation level by one layer. However, it is only effective for martial artists whose cultivation levels is below the fourth layer of Element Gathering Tier,\" Ling Han revealed the benefits first, then he said, \"How about it, do you guys still want to continue?\"Liu Dong and his group all looked hesitant. On one hand, they all craved for greater power, but on the other hand, the Red Scaled Dragon Snake was not an easy opponent. If they weren't careful, they not only wouldn't be able to obtain the beast's inner core, but also become the prey of the great snake, and their bones would join the ever increasing pile in the cave.Ling Han only looked at them with a soft smile. In truth, since he dared to venture here, then of course he was certain of his ability to handle the Red Scaled Dragon Snake. This was his test for the five of them....Because these five people had led him to the lair of the Red Scaled Dragon Snake, he wanted to reward them with a big gift. However, this would depend on whether or not they had the courage to obtain this opportunity.The expressions on the five of them very quickly turned into determined looks, and they said, \"Let's do it!\"\"If we can manage to reach the fourth layer of Element Gathering Tier, then we would have a chance of squeezing into the top ten participants of the tournament at the end of the year! We'd be able to enter Hu Yang Academy then!\"\"We have to take the risk!\"Ling Han nodded, and said, \"No regrets?\"\"We definitely will not regret it!\" The five of them said loudly in unison.\"All right, then here's a mission for you, go catch a Bright Wool Sheep and bring it here,\" Ling Han said.\"Bright Wool Sheep?\" Liu Dong and the rest stared blankly. Bright Wool Sheep was only a demonic beast of Body Refining Tier and there was nothing special about it. What did Ling Han want such a creature for?Ling Han smiled and said, \"Bright Wool Sheep is the favorite food of the Red Scaled Dragon Snake.\"Chen Peng Ju had not yet reached the conclusion. He dimly asked, \"Why do we have to feed that great snake?\"\"Stupid!\" Zhu Xue Yi immediately knocked him on the head, \"If we place some kind of drug in the body of the Bright Wool Sheep, then wouldn't it end up in the stomach of that great snake?\"\"Oh, that's right!\" Chen Peng Ju scratched his head. His suddenly enlightened expression caused everyone else to laugh loudly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 49": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Alchemy Emperor of the Divine DaoCH 49Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEveryone proceeded to carry out their assigned tasks--Liu Dong and his group went off to hunt the Bright Wool Sheep while Ling Han took out a variety of medicinal ingredients, preparing to concoct a particular drug.It was only an Alchemy Emperor like Ling Han who could handle medicinal ingredients well enough to be able to concoct a drug targeted specifically against a particular creature. The drug he was concocting now could be considered harmless to any other living creature, but for the Red Scaled Dragon Snake alone... it was deadly.In many situations, alchemists were also poison masters. For example, the Little Poison Lord, Yu Zheng. However, his ability was far, far beneath Ling Han's.Although the Bright Wool Sheep was not a powerful demonic beast, its flesh was extremely delicious. It was not only the favorite prey of many other demonic beasts, it was also considered a delicacy for human beings. As a result, their population in the area dwindled--it was not an easy matter to actually find one.After a whole three days had passed, Liu Dong and his group finally returned. Chen Peng Ju was carrying a creature that looked like a mountain goat on his back. It had a gorgeous woolen coat that looked like the finest brocade.They had finally captured a Bright Wool Sheep.Ling Han fed the drug he had concocted to the Bright Wool Sheep before making a gash on one of its legs. He then threw it into the lair of the Red Scaled Dragon Snake....The great snake's sense of smell was quite powerful. The smell of blood would definitely cause it to wake up from its deep slumber, and since the Bright Wool Sheep was its favorite food, it wouldn't be able to hold back from coming out to enjoy another big meal even if it was already full.Why did they have to use a living prey? That's because each Red Scaled Dragon Snake was very cautious by nature. Unless the prey was something it had killed itself, it would definitely not eat it.After Ling Han came out of the cavern, he retreated with others some distance away; they hid behind a boulder nearby so that the great snake wouldn't discover their presence once it came out of the cavern.Not long after, they felt the ground tremble beneath them, as if some colossal beast was going berserk nearby.It was the Red Scaled Dragon Snake.\"Peng!\"A gigantic red-colored snake weaved out of the cavern's entrance as if it was an arrow shot from a bow. Its diameter was bigger than that of a bucket, and it was also extremely long. Whatever they could see of its body was already pushing close to a hundred metres yet there was still no sign of the end of its tail.There were two fine membranes protruding from the great snake's neck. Currently, the two membranes were trembling, producing a weird \"wu wu wu\" sound.Finally, the entire body of the great snake was out. Its total length was about two hundred metres and its whole body was covered with crimson scales. Each scale was about the size of a bowl's lid. It seemed to have gone mad and was continuously ramming into obstructions in all directions. Its long tail was like a whip, shattering many of the surrounding boulders in the course of its rampage.\"How come that thing's not dead from the poison yet?\" Liu Dong and his group gasped in shock. They were completely unable to comprehend it.\"Duh! That's a demonic beast in the ninth layer of Element Gathering Tier! Moreover, it has inherited a shred of the dragon's bloodline, and has been acclaimed as a ruler among demonic beasts of the Tier! How could it die so easily!\" Ling Han said, shaking his head. If it was that simple to kill it, he would not have needed to wait until he had reached the peak period of the first layer of Element Gathering Tier to come here.\"Oh no, it's noticed us!\"That great snake had a very strong sense of smell, so even if Ling Han and the others had concealed themselves in a spot downwind of it, the snake had still discovered their presence. It immediately weaved its gigantic body and charged towards them.\"Si si!\" The great serpent's tongue flickered, and the two membranes at the sides of its neck trembled, producing a weird sound. A rotting stench wafted over.\"Yu Tong, let's join forces, we need to detain it!\" Ling Han did not feel fear at all. He simply drew his sword and threw himself forward.Liu Yu Tong did not respond. She simply followed Ling Han closely, and for the first time, drew her weapon of choice.She was also a sword user.The two of them worked together with their swords brandished in a dance, aimed at the Red Scaled Dragon Snake.Theoretically speaking, Liu Yu Tong had also achieved the ninth layer of Element Gathering Tier, so she should not be at a disadvantage in terms of power when facing this great snake. However, the Red Scaled Dragon Snake possessed a thread of the dragon's bloodline, so whether in terms of brute power or defense, it was still stronger than any other being at the ninth layer of Element Gathering Tier. Even Liu Yu Tong was not qualified to battle it head on.It was a ruler of this cultivation tier, and only other rulers of the tier possessed the ability to battle it one on one!Ling Han possessed the Five Element Origin Nuclei and his power similarly exceeded those of the same cultivation level, so he did have a right to the name 'ruler'. The problem was that his current cultivation level was still too low!Even if the two of them were working together, they were still forced to jump and dodge in all directions, proving the great power this serpent possessed.\"Be patient, it's already poisoned, so it can't hold on for much longer. But we definitely can't allow it to flee,\" Ling Han said.\"En!\" Liu Yu Tong nodded.Ling Han used all his abilities, and every wave of his sword would form four flashes of Sword Qi. \"Pu, pu, pu, pu,\" four wounds appeared on the body of the Red Scaled Dragon Snake. On the other hand, his actual sword itself didn't even manage to penetrate the scales of the great snake.This was the power of Sword Qi, and this was also why it was something that every self-respecting swordsman would revere greatly. And when they saw the four flashes of Sword Qi Ling Han had just displayed, Liu Dong and his group were completely stunned, their mouths agape; they were absolutely speechless.However, the great snake's counterattack was also extremely swift and fierce. Its tail whipped and the shattered rocks shot out at a terrifying force, causing bloody spots to continuously appear on Ling Han's body.Ling Han didn't even make a single sound of pain at this. On the contrary, he started to stimulate Lone Wolf's Blood within his body.\"Weng,\" the Five Elements Origin Nuclei within his Dantian began rotating at a greater speed, causing his power to increase. At the same time, the circulation of the Indestructible Heaven Scroll allowed his wounds to begin recovering at an extremely rapid rate.The circulation of these two different techniques, along with the fierce battle he was now in, caused the Origin Power within Ling Han's body to be consumed at a very fast rate.For any other person to battle at his full strength, he might be able to last for about half an hour, but for Ling Han, ten minutes was already his limit.But, he had already long anticipated this situation and so prepared a large number of medium level Return Origin Pills for himself. Should he start feeling that his Origin Power was flowing out, he'd take one of the pills; there shouldn't be any problem for him to continue battling for about twenty minutes with his current supply of pills.They had to detain the great snake by all means......for he had concocted the drug to especially \"aim\" at the Red Scaled Dragon Snake. The serpent had a Yin nature, so he had prepared a large store of medicinal ingredients that possessed a Yang nature or were of fire alignment, causing Yin and Yang within the snake's body to conflict, damaging the life force of the Red Scaled Dragon Snake. But it was also very easy to cure this poison. As long as it dived into a river, using the water to extinguish the flames raging within its body, it'd be able to completely recover after three or four days by simply resting.Under the influence of its instincts, the Red Scaled Dragon Snake would definitely go off in search of water, so they needed to stop it here by all means. If it wasn't for this, Ling Han would have had the whole group hide somewhere further away and wait for the Red Scaled Dragon Snake to die before returning to collect their rewards.After the battle had persisted for a while, the great snake's initial rage passed and it became restless instead. It felt as if an inferno was raging within its body, causing it to feel the pressure of death closing in. It no longer attacked fiercely but its head turned around instead, intending to flee.\"Where do you think you're going!\" Ling Han quickly waved his sword in a slash. He had entered Seven Wind Mountains firstly for the Earth Dragon Grass, and secondly, for the inner core of this great serpent so that he'd be able to concoct the Transcending Origin Pill. If he wanted to advance his cultivation level in a short period of time, he needed to depend on the external support of this medicinal pill.\"Pa,\" the great serpent gave a wave of its tail, creating a terrifying shockwave. Although its tail had not directly hit Ling Han, the shockwave produced caused Ling Han to fly backwards.The ninth layer of Element Gathering Tier was indeed powerful!Ling Han felt rueful. The higher the cultivation level, the more difficult it was to skip cultivation levels when challenging someone. Element Gathering Tier was still fine, but once he reached Gushing Spring Tier, even the difference of one layer would be an immeasurable gulf. If he, with a cultivation level of the first layer of Gushing Spring Tier, battled against an opponent in the ninth layer of Gushing Spring Tier, he'd be instantly obliterated in one move. There was no way he'd be able to prolong the battle for even slightly longer.Liu Yu Tong produced a light whistle as her long sword freely waved like rain, and a high level Yellow Grade sword arts unfolded. Her attack was like rain, and effectively parried the Red Scaled Dragon Snake's blow.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 50": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Alchemy Emperor of the Divine DaoCH 50Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLing Han and Liu Yu Tong had already started taking pills like mad.The pills Ling Han had been taking helped him replenish his Origin Power while the ones Liu Yu Tong had been taking were meant to speed up the recovery of wounds. A head-on clash with this kind of demonic beast was practically seeking death, and she had already sustained considerable internal injuries within a few short minutes of battle.Thankfully, the pills Ling Han concocted were of excellent quality and allowed her to maintain her battle prowess at her best condition. Furthermore, because of Lone Wolf's Blood, her battle prowess was still on a soaring rise....Ling Han had taught it to her some time ago.With the increasing battle prowess she possessed further enhanced by the circulation of the Lone Wolf's Blood, Liu Yu Tong could just about handle a head-on clash with the Red Scaled Dragon Snake.If the Red Scaled Dragon Snake had not been poisoned, then the losers of this battle would definitely be Ling Han and Liu Yu Tong. But things were different now. They only needed to hold on for twenty minutes.As the battle persisted, the Red Scaled Dragon Snake became more and more frantic. The conflict between the Yin and the Yang in its body was becoming even more intense, and there were already many places on its body that had exploded. Green-colored blood splattered everywhere. It had a corrosive nature--falling on the rocks littered around, the blood actually melted the rocks at an extremely quick pace.There was also poisonous gas floating around in the air that could easily poison and kill a martial artist in the ninth layer of Element Gathering Tier!If it did not possess such awe-inspiring abilities, how could it be labeled the ruler of Element Gathering Tier?Rulers were, of course, invincible!Unfortunately, it had encountered Ling Han.Ling Han and Liu Yu Tong had already taken antidotes, and the powerful poison only caused them to feel slightly dizzy, not having too much effect on their battle prowess.\"Si si!\" The Red Scaled Dragon Snake could feel death approaching and began to attempt to flee recklessly. In its eyes, it only needed to solve the problem within its body, and then dealing with these two insignificant human beings would be a cinch.Liu Yu Tong was enraged too. She brandished her long sword like she was holding a rainbow in her hand, as if she was a battle goddess displaying her heroic beauty.The great serpent did its utmost to flee, while Ling Han and Liu Yu Tong did their utmost to stop it from fleeing. If they missed this chance, the Red Scaled Dragon Snake would definitely not be fooled next time and they'd have to wait until Liu Yu Tong broke through to Gushing Spring Tier before coming again.A large river appeared some distance ahead.The Red Scaled Dragon Snake seemed to understand that the river's water would cure its poison and instantly became energetic, increasing the speed of its escape. Even if it suffered attacks from Liu Yu Tong, it did not attempt to counterattack even once. It seemed to have made its decision to do its utmost to slip into the river.A flash of absolute determination crossed Liu Yu Tong's eyes as she raised her sword high up and lightly shouted, \"One sword of Heaven's Martial Arts determines the Universe!\"\"Xiu,\" she waved her sword, and it was almost as if wielder and sword were as one, slashing towards the neck of the Red Scaled Dragon Snake.Ling Han's expression changed and he shouted loudly, \"Don't be reckless!\"This slash was much too powerful and the Red Scaled Dragon Snake dared not receive it head on. Otherwise, it was highly likely that the great serpent would be killed by this one slash. It gave a loud hiss, and the serpent's body quickly coiled in place, concealing its head within its coiled body to protect it.\"Pu!\"The long sword lowered quickly in a slash, and a flash of Sword Qi was revealed, which actually chopped the body of the Red Scaled Dragon Snake in two; green blood instantly gushed out like a spring.The great serpent twisted all over the ground in agony. Close to one third of its body near to its tail had actually been chopped off by this sword slash of Liu Yu Tong!\"Pa,\" Liu Yu Tong's delicate figure wavered, and she fell down towards the ground.Ling Han quickly leaped up to catch the icy beauty before she hit the ground. He frowned and said, \"Are you crazy? You actually forcibly squeezed your Origin Nucleus to increase your own battle prowess! If it exploded, you'd lose your life!\"\"I managed to form Sword Qi! Did you see, I formed Sword Qi!\" Liu Yu Tong said weakly, but excitedly. At that moment, there was only one thought in her head, and that was to obstruct the Red Scaled Dragon Snake. She could not disappoint Ling Han.With the support of this conviction, she actually broke through her own limits and managed to form Sword Qi.\"You silly girl, if you dare to do something like this again, I'll smack your behind!\" Ling Han lifted Liu Yu Tong onto his back. The Red Scaled Dragon Snake's energy was now close to being completely spent. Although the river was not too far away, it could no longer reach it.A red flush appeared on Liu Yu Tong's beautiful, cold face, but she plastered her face onto Ling Han's back. Hearing the strong beating of his heart, her mind was empty of any stray thoughts.The Red Scaled Dragon Snake was still twisting around on the ground, yet the extent of its movements was becoming smaller and smaller; finally, it no longer made any movements.Yet Ling Han did not make any impulsive moves. A centipede dies but never falls down, and the serpent was extremely long. Moreover, this Red Scaled Dragon Snake was considered within the ranks of kings!\"Big Brother Ling!\" Liu Dong and his group raced over. Their faces were filled with astonishment, and when they looked at Ling Han, it was as if they were looking at some kind of monster.How could they not be astonished?Although the Red Scaled Dragon Snake had been poisoned, its battle prowess had not weakened; Ling Han actually managed to battle with it for such a long time. Even if the main attacking force had been Liu Yu Tong, this was still an unbelievable feat.If it had been them in his place, one whip of the great serpent's tail would probably be enough to make them all die in one go.\"Is Miss Liu all right?\" they asked.\"She should be all right,\" Ling Han smiled. With an Alchemy Emperor like him nearby, as long as she still had one breath within her, there was no way she would die. He was just about to have Liu Dong and his group watch over her and the serpent while he enters the cavern to pluck the Earth Dragon Grass when he suddenly spotted a few people coming out from the bushes on the river's banks.There were six people in total, and the one in the lead was a young man. The others were five men dressed all in black and seemed to be of different ages. From the looks of it, they were the lackeys of the young man.\"Hahahaha, it's an actual Red Scaled Dragon Snake!\" The young man rubbed his hands and laughed loudly, \"That's why I said we should come over here and check things out when we heard the commotion! We actually encountered such a good thing.\"\"Young Master's good fortune is as high as the sky!\" The five men in black said in unison, showing off their abilities of currying favor.\"Quickly carry this great serpent back for me, I'll let Grandfather see how great I am!\" The young man immediately commanded.\"Understood!\" The five men in black walked towards where the Red Scaled Dragon Snake was lying.The six of them were speaking amongst themselves as if they had completely not seen that Ling Han and the others were also here.\"Hey, we were the ones who killed that Red Scaled Dragon Snake!\" Zhu Xue Yi shouted loudly in anger.Li Hao had already drawn his saber, preparing to step forwards to stop them.Yet Ling Han raised one hand to stop him from advancing further, and said, smiling, \"You don't have to do anything!\"Li Hao and the others couldn't understand him. Could it be that Ling Han really intended to surrender the Red Scaled Dragon Snake just like that? But Ling Han did not seem at all as if he was that kind of person. Previously, even though he had known Hang Zhan had been the grandson of the Seventh Elder of Stone Wolf Sect, he had still done as he had said and killed the man. His brow hadn't even twitched back then.When the young man on the other side saw this, his face was filled with an expression that told them this was something common to him. Because of his identity, it was absolutely normal for other groups to yield to him.Yet it was at this very moment that the situation changed drastically!The Red Scaled Dragon Snake that seemed to have completely died actually coiled up! Its head shot out and bit one of the men in black, snapping him in half, whilst its body coiled and constrained the other four tightly.This was its final attack before death. As it gathered all its remaining strength to carry it out, it was extremely powerful.\"Ka ka ka,\" the sound of bones shattering continued for a long time; the four people who had been trapped in the snake's coiled body were instantly squeezed into a lump of flesh and blood, which had all mixed together into an indefinable lump--there was no way to identify who was who now.Meanwhile, the man the great serpent had bitten in half was only left with two legs that walked a few steps in different directions before they fell down with a \"pa\".\"Pa,\" the Red Scaled Dragon Snake once again lay down on the ground, and this time, it was finally dead.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
