In a state of agitation, he reaches out his hand and rubs his forehead to clear his thoughts.All he can vaguely recall is that he was on his way back to his dorm after finishing the day\u2019s work on studying genetically modified potatoes in his lab when suddenly a mysterious and powerful force pushed him into a river. The last sensation he felt was the agonizing fear of drowning to his death, which seemed to have lingered forever.While looking around the room, Xiao Jingting recalls from his dream that he now has the memory of a man with the same name as his \u2013 a second-generation descendant of a wealthy family who now is in straitened circumstances. With his surroundings getting more and more familiar with those in that man\u2019s memory, he realizes he has traveled back through time.Before he could wrap his head around what\u2019s happened, he finds his stomach is grumbling.Rubbing his belly, Xiao Jingting rolls out of the bed to cook himself some food.As he builds the fire and starting cooking, the man keeps organizing all the pieces of his newfound memory. Obviously, he has traveled back to the body of a young man from the Xiao family. The man\u2019s parents were both very capable and successful people but were seldom home. Due to a lack of proper parental discipline, the man was spoiled rotten and ended up becoming a good-for-nothing who would spend his days either loafing around or visiting one brothel after another.Had his parents been alive, Childe Xiao would have kept leading a comfortable life without a care in the world. Unfortunately for him, his parents got into an accident while on business, and with no one to support him anymore, the man was banished by his own family to a desolate and remote place.In the middle of cooking, Xiao Jingting hears a rustling sound.Then he sees the door across him is slightly opened and through the crack a child is observing him from outside.Xiao Jingting keeps his head lowered without speaking or doing anything else.The previous owner has a wife who was originally one of his servants to whom he married after he, drunk into oblivion, forced himself upon him in a quite scandalous affair. The man didn\u2019t like his wife at all and the couple had long had a bad relationship.The couple father two sons even though they had only shared the same bed a few times.In this world, it\u2019s not easy for men to conceive, and the man\u2019s wife proves to be much more fertile than everyone else. The previous Xiao had quite a number of female and male confidants, all of whom would trash talk his wife to him in private, saying that the boys were not his, his male wife cheated on him, and that he was raising someone else\u2019s children.The previous Xiao, being easy to be influenced, grew suspicious of his wife whom he already disliked, and consequently, his disdain for his wife spread to his own sons.Back when he was living in his mansion, the man would simply ignore the existence of his wife and children, which in a way avoided much friction between them. But after he was banished to this remote village, the man was filled with bitterness for the ill treatment from his own family. Unable to vent his grievance, the man chose to unleash his anger and frustration upon his wife and children.Xiao Jingting assumes that his male wife, Xu Mu\u2019an, has probably gone out looking for food.Because the husband always gets violent, whenever Xu Mu\u2019an goes outside, he would tell his two boys to lock the door from the inside in case their father causes any trouble.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Xiao Jingting is only seventeen years old, but he already has two sons \u2013 four-year-old Xiao Xiaodong and three-year-old Xiao Xiaofan.This somehow puts the man, who is a twenty-seven-year-old single man in the previous world, to shame.The previous Xiao had always been reluctant to pay much attention to his two children. Since the older son was born in winter, he simply picked the name Xiaodong (\u201cDong\u201d means winter in Chinese), while as for the younger son whom he thought was not special at all, he named him Xiaofan (\u201cFan\u201d means ordinary in Chinese).Despite his young age, his older son, Xiaodong is quite smart and cunning.The younger son, Xiaofan, however, is nothing like his bother. Shortly after Xiao Xaofan was born, the boy fell seriously ill. The father didn\u2019t bother to care, and when the doctor was called in, it was too late. The severe fever got to the boy\u2019s brain and has since left him mentally handicapped.Xiao Jingting raises his head and looks at the door where he finds a small head cautiously peaking through the crack. After meeting the man\u2019s eyes, the child instantly draws back his head, and after Xiao Jingting looks away, the small head pops up one again.Even though Xiao Jingting and Xu Mu\u2019an were spouses, the former had never treated his male wife as one, forbidding him to take any food in their home. Whenever the husband was out drinking and seeking pleasure, Xu Mu\u2019an had no choice but to find food for him and his two boys on his own.Lowering his head, Xiao Jingting remembers that he left his original home with eight hundred liang of silver ingots while Xu Mu\u2019an didn\u2019t have a cent. Had the man scrimped on the money, it could have last him for a while.However, this spoiled childe, who wouldn\u2019t blink an eye while handing out generous tips to servants, couldn\u2019t change his reckless way of spending and after only a few trips to town, he ended up squandering all the money on his vices.The previous Xiao\u2019s eventual death was caused by his hopeless addiction to the so-called Happy Powder, a nerve-paralyzing drug that is said to give people extreme pleasure.After knowing every detail about the man whose body he\u2019s trapped in, Xiao Jingting is suddenly filled with a sense of gloom for his future.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",

Although Xiao Xiaofan is mentally challenged from that fever, he still possesses the instinct for self-protection. The realization that the previous owner must have frequently beaten the boy frustrates Xiao Jingting for traveling back to become someone who used to mistreat his own son.The man puts the bowl on the table and starts eating. The door cracks open once again and there runs into Xiao Xiaofan who obviously has succumbed to his hunger.Seeing the small boy\u2019s expecting look, Xiao Jingting holds him up and puts him on a chair by the table.The sight of the boy\u2019s old and patched clothes brings a bit of pity and regret to Xiao Jingting\u2019s heart. Xiaofan is just a little boy who is too young to care about anything else than fill his empty stomach.After moving to this place, the previous Xiao would often come back home from outside with food and Xiao Xiaofan would run over to ask for something to eat. If the father was in a good mood that day, he would spare a part of the food to the boy, but if he happened to be in a foul mood, he would beat the boy instead. And most of the times, it was the second situation.Xiao Xiaofan wolfs down his food and while doing so, he keeps holding his bowl tightly with one hand, as if someone would snatch it away from him anytime.Xiao Jingting pushes a bowl of steamed egg to the skinny boy.Xiao Xiaofan eyes sideways at the man with suspicion, and after making sure he means no harm, the boy tentatively pulls the bowl of egg to himself. Seeing Xiao Jingting acting normal, he immediately eats the whole thing up.The door stirs again and Xiao Jingting notices someone else is studying him behind it.Xiao Jingting lowers his head. That boy behind the door is Xiao Xiaodong, the young yet very smart older son. Xiao Jingting keeps his head lowered, trying to act as normally as he can. The memory of the previous Xiao tells him that this world is very special, so he decides to try not to be seen as an alien and risk getting burned to death.After finishing eating, Xiao Xiaofan seems to have remembered something, so he bolts out of the room. A moment later, Xiao Jingting hears the sound of the door across him being locked back up.\u201cWhy on earth did you go to him again?\u201d Xiao Xiaodong bristles at his little brother.Xiao Xiaofan raises his small head and answers with an innocent grin, \u201cBecause he got something delicious.\u201dXiao Xiaodong fumes, \u201cFood, food! What else do you know? Dad left us bread when he went outside.\u201d\u201cBut I don\u2019t like bread,\u201d Xiao Xiaofan replies with an upset look, holding his chin with his hands.Xiao Xiaodong bites his lips as he finds himself agree with his brother. Although there is enough bread to fill their stomachs, it is indeed unpleasant to eat or swallow because it tastes just like sand.\u201cWe\u2019re lucky enough to have food,\u201d Xiao Xiaodong sulks.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Realizing his brother is angry, Xiao Xiaofan lowers his head and pulls at his clothes nervously.\u201cDon\u2019t ever open this door without my permission. What if he barges in and takes things from us again?\u201d Xiao Xiaodong warns the younger boy.\u201cI\u2019ll remember that,\u201d Xiao Xiaofan answers, nodding his head.Since the two young boys shut their door, Xiao Jingting has been listening to them talking the whole time outside. After traveling back to the previous Xiao\u2019s body, the man suddenly realizes his hearing has become a lot sharper because he has managed to hear every word the two boys said.After being expelled to this place, the previous Xiao had, at one point, wished that his family would let him go back. So he kept spending hand over foot and after he wasted all his money, he thought of Xu Mu\u2019an and started looting his room. Eventually, he robbed all the money his male wife had taken great pains to accumulate.Xiao Jingting rubs his forehead. Although none of those things was done by him per se, he still feels it is part of his life due to the fact that he now owns the body and memory of the previous man.\u201cBig bother, the steamed egg he made was really good,\u201d Xiao Xiaofan smacks his mouth, saying.\u201cA big spender like him will lose everything he has sooner or later. When that day comes, we will all be in trouble,\u201d Xiao Xiaodong snaps.\u201cSo, we will be left with no food?\u201d Xiao Xiaofan asks, trying to understand what his brother said.The older boy responds with a nod, \u201cYes. We will be left with no food and no place to live. We will be on the streets.\u201dThe boy\u2019s answer immediately frightens Xiao Xiaofan to tears, \u201cI don\u2019t want that!\u201dThe younger boy\u2019s crying instantly fills Xiao Jingting\u2019s heart with guilt and sadness all at once.After returning to his own room, Xiao Jingting starts checking whatever has been left of his belongings. When he first arrived here, he had twenty mu (1.33 hectares) of farmland on the account book, including five mu of first-rate land, six mu of medium-rate land and nine mu of lower-rate land. Now, he only has five mu of lower-rate farmland left.Xiao Jingting scratches his head, condemning the loser of a man for squandering nearly all his property and at the same time, lamenting the fact that fate seems to have let him travel back through time at the worst possible time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Naturally, he is both thrilled and a bit bashful when he finds out that he has married to a good-looking male wife in this life.The previous Xiao and his male wife had a poor relationship. Even though the couple lived under the same roof, they rarely shared much of a conversation, and even if there was one, it was far from being amicable.Xiao Jingting decides not to get chummy with the man so suddenly. Instead, he stays in his room and keeps her ears open.Following a call of \u201cXiaodong\u201d from Xu Mu\u2019an, the door is heard being opened.\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d Xu Mu\u2019an walks in, asking his two skinny boys apologetically.\u201cNo,\u201d Xiao Xiaofan raises his hand, answering loudly.Xiao Xiaodong casts a glare at his younger brother, which makes the little one recoil.Xu Mu\u2019an looks at Xiao Xiaofan curiously. Being mentally disadvantaged, his younger son almost never lies. Usually, every time he is back, the starved boy would get clingy and ask for food. Therefore, Xu Mu\u2019an has reason to believe that his little boy must have eaten after he said he\u2019s not hungry.\u201cHas you brother eaten already?\u201d The dad asks Xiao Xiaodong.The boy nods, saying, \u201cYes. That man cooked porridge and my brother ate with him.\u201d\u201cI also had steamed egg. It was delicious.\u201d Xiao Xiaofan licks his lips once again.\u201cDid he beat you?\u201d Xu Mu\u2019an asks.\u201cNo,\u201d Xiao Xiaofan answers.\u201cI\u2019ve told you to stay away from him. I won\u2019t pity you if he beats you to death some day,\u201d Xiao Xiaodong scowls at his bother.Xiao Xiaofan, pouting and fiddling his fingers, talks back with a wronged look, \u201cBut, he is our father!\u201dSeeing the pitiful look on his brother\u2019s face, Xiao Xiaodong decides not to remind him of the truth that their so-called father has never once treated them like they are their sons.\u201cDad, do you think he is up to something?\u201d Xiao Xiaodong asks vigilantly.Xu Mu\u2019an shakes his head and replies in an exhausted voice, \u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d\u201cDad, that bastard got addicted to gambling and I heard he has been taking Happy Powder. He has sold almost all the farmland. I think next he is going to sell this house and all of us,\u201d Xiao Xiaodong says furiously.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Xu Mu\u2019an keeps his head lowered, looking upset and worried.In this wild world they live in, most of the people live off their farmlands. People here are categorized in a five-element, hierarchical system of metal, wood, water, fire and earth. Among them, those from the wood group are capable of facilitating the crops\u2019 growth; those from the water group are able to keep their crops irrigated; the earth group is known for keeping their farmlands fertile, while the metal group can leave the land barren and the fire group can hurt the crops. People from the latter two groups are considered a lot inferior to the other three groups.After being confirmed to be one of the fire people, Xu Mu\u2019an was sold by his parents to others.Xiao Jingting, on the other hand, is said to belong to the water or wood group, which makes him advantageous in farming. Unfortunately, this spoiled and lazy childe had never once gone to the farmland.Leaning against the door, Xiao Jingting keeps eavesdropping on the dad and sons next door. From the previous Xiao\u2019s memory, he already knows Xiao Xiaodong is quite intelligent. Now he\u2019s learned that his elder son is also capable of such forethoughtfulness.In this world, there are men, woman and androgynous people. Androgynous people, who can get married to either a man or a woman, have a rather inferior social class. After Xu Mu\u2019an was sold to the Xiao family, he was required to sign an indenture. Therefore, if Xiao Jingting wanted to sell his sons, Xu Mu\u2019an couldn\u2019t do anything about it.A sense of hopelessness starts to rise in Xu Mu\u2019an\u2019s heart.The man now has level three spirit power. Had it not for these two boys, he would have joined the mercenaries or become a security guard for an influential family. Either would have sufficed to provide him with the essentials he needs in life. However, the reality is that he has two children and one of them is mentally disabled.Xu Mu\u2019an, with his head lowered, feels at a loss for the future.\u201cDad, what are we going to eat today?\u201d Xiao Xiaodong asks expectantly.\u201cWild veggies,\u201d Xu Mu\u2019an says apologetically.Almost instantly, the look in Xiao Xiaodong\u2019s eyes dim. Both Xiao Xiaodong and Xiao Xiaofan are developing and in need of nutrition. However, Xu Mu\u2019an is unable to provide what his boys need the most. Sometimes, he is lucky enough to capture a wild animal, but those are very rare occasions.Xu Mu\u2019an takes a sad sigh. The man has trepidations to go deep into the forest, because he knows if he ends up dead, Xiao Jingting won\u2019t bother to raise the boys and will just let them die as well.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Knowing what that is, he quickly reaches to his chest pouch and takes out a jade pendent.The pale cyan jade pendent immediately brings a surge of hope and joy in Xiao Jingting\u2019s heart.In his previous life, he owned a piece of family heirloom, a jade pendent just like the one he\u2019s holding in his hand right now.In the world he came from, various doomsday literary works prevailed and so did a theory about the so-called alternate universe.Xiao Jingting once tries to confirm the genetic relationship between him and his family heirloom using a drop of his own blood. The second his blood touched the jade pendent, another universe indeed presented itself in front of him. At the time, the jade pendent opened up a space measuring merely one square meter, which amounted to be of no use. In this life, however, the other universe contains a patch of farmland, an underground spring and various plant seeds stored inside a ring by his former self.Xiao Jingting goes through his memory once again and realizes that the previous Xiao didn\u2019t have any jade pendent, which leads him to believe that the pendent was probably the reason why he traveled to this world.All of sudden, he is taken over by a fit of overwhelming dizziness followed by nausea and a flood of uncontrollable craving gripping every fiber of his being, and finally, a powerful upsurge of blood in his throat. Xiao Jingting realizes his body\u2019s addition to the Happy Powder is acting up, just like how any human body\u2019s reaction to the recurrence of drug addiction he knows from his previous life.Xiao Jingting keeps trembling violently as he curses the previous Xiao over and over again for getting addicted to the expensive and dangerous Happy Powder.For a moment, he finds himself suspecting whether this is his due punishment for taking another man\u2019s body. But if God can be his witness, he had always remained a law-abiding citizen in his previous life, yet he still traveled into a drug addict\u2019s body and ended up suffering from that man\u2019s mistaken.For what\u2019s worth, he is still alive, albeit miserably and even though he got himself into a loser\u2019s body, things could have been much worse. Xiao Jingting tries to comfort himself this way.Now all he needs to do is stick as long as he can and waits till this wave of addiction passes.Xiao Jingting opens the door and sees Xu M\u2019an, Xiao Xiaodong and Xiao Xiaofen having meal at the table in the middle of which there is nothing but a bowl of wild vegetable broth. Xiao Jingting\u2019s appearance instantly leads Xiao Xiaodong to raise his alert, like a little hedgehog brandishing its spikes. The boy\u2019s instinctive hostility and vigilant glare causes a guilty conscience on Xiao Jingting\u2019s part.With a slightly upset look, Xu Mu\u2019an turns on his side from the table and pulls the two little boys behind him. Hiding behind his dad, Xiao Xiaofan keeps eyeing at Xiao Jingting with curiosity.Seeing that his appearance has turned the originally cheerful mealtime shared between the three into a tense one, Xiao Jingting steps out of the door without saying anything.Xu Mu\u2019an feels a bit unsettled by the man\u2019s silence.Although Xu Mu\u2019an seldom speaks to Xiao Jingting, he keeps himself informed of what his husband does every day because despite everything, the whole family\u2019s livelihood is directly linked to the man of the house. Even though he knows about Xiao Jingting\u2019s debauchery and his addiction to Happy Powder, he has nothing else to do except spending his days worrying about his husband.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.From the members of a village family whose son works as a choreman at a pawnshop in town, Xu Mu\u2019an learned that Xiao Jingting pawned off five mu of top-rate farmland, six mu of medium-rate land and four mu of low-rate land, which leaves him with only five mu of low-rate farmland.After finding out what Xiao Jingting did about the farmland, Xu Mu\u2019an was so enraged that he wanted to slap that man in the face, because the farmland is the only thing they can fall back on to make some money! Even if they didn\u2019t do any farm work, they could have opted to rent the land to others.Once again, Xu Mu\u2019an feels frustrated about his predestined nature and can\u2019t help but wish he were one of the wood people who are good at tending farmland, rather than being someone like him who have to make ends meet by doing things that are dangerous and risky.\u201cDad, he\u2019s gone. I can\u2019t believe he just left,\u201d Xiao Xiaodong says with a frowned and worried look. In his experience, it never bodes well when Xiao Jingting acts abnormally.Xu Mu\u2019an bites on his lips, thinking now that Xiao Jingting has been consigned to this remote place, it means he\u2019s already been abandoned by his family. But this spoiled childe has refused to face reality and change his debauched lifestyle and instead, has kept his wishful thinking that someday his big and wealthy family would bring him back.\u201cHe has an addition. Is it possible that he went outside to buy Happy Powder again? Wang Xiaole\u2019s father also became addicted to that drug and the man sold his son,\u201d Xiao Xiaodong is deeply concerned. Wang Xiaole\u2019s father, the man he just mentioned, used to be a hired long-term help in the Xiao family. Back then when he lived in the Xiao mansion, Xiao Xiaodong and Wang Xiaole were buddies.The boy\u2019s suspicion toward Xiao Jingting keeps growing by the minute because of the latter\u2019s unusual behavior just now. Xiao Xiaodong is more and more afraid that their so-called father is probably planning on selling his little brother, Xiao Xiaofan.Xu Mu\u2019an takes a deep breath, looking even more desperate. In fact, he was just thinking about the same thing as his elder son.The man had thought about leaving this place with his two boys without Xiao Jingting knowing, but his indenture is still in that man\u2019s possession. Even if he ran off with the two children, he wouldn\u2019t be able to provide for them and end up becoming a runaway slave.Xiao Xiaofan looks at Xiao Xiaodong and Xu Mu\u2019an with an uncomprehending look, \u201cDad, big bother, has Father gone out to eat and drink again?\u201dXu Mu\u2019an takes a look\u00a0at his younger son and lets outs another sigh before saying to the two boys, \u201cLet\u2019s just eat. We\u2019ll talk about it later.\u201dSince Xiao Xiaofan is already full, he just eats a little soup while Xu Mu\u2019an and Xiao Xiaodong finish all the rest of the food despite the unpalatable wild vegetables.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Despite the mildly poisonous property of this medicinal herb, it does no harm to most human bodies. But to Xu Mu\u2019an, the herb has surprisingly proved to be much more beneficial.Drive by extreme hunger one day when he was little, Xu Mu\u2019an accidentally ate a Lieyan Herb, which immediately caused a scorching sensation inside him like a flame was coursing through his body. In an effort to control the excruciating agony, he had to apply his inner force. To his surprise, after the pain subsided, he felt his power had significantly improved.In this world, people mostly rely on magical herbs to improve their inner force. Many spiritual plant masters are specialized in boosting the growth of spiritual plants which make people more powerful. Compared with their counterparts from the fire group, spiritual plant masters from the wood group enjoy more benefits from the edible herbs. As a result, they are more advanced in their level of practicing than spiritual plant masters from the fire group.Xu Mu\u2019an takes a deep breath as he stares at the herb in the box. Those from the Xiao family all assumed that the reason he made it to level three spirit power was because of Xiao Jingting\u2019s help. Only Xu Mu\u2019an himself knows that he has the Lieyan Herb to thank for his progress in practicing.He closes his eyes. In fact, the Lieyan Herb has become less and less effective for him and when the herb stops working, his practice will draw to a complete end as well. Despite that, he has been fortunate because a lot of his fellow practicers from the fire group have stalled at level two spirit power for their entire lives.Xu Mu\u2019an inhales deeply and takes in all the remaining five herbs at once. The next moment, the familiar pain washes over him. Having got used to it, Xu Mu\u2019an is soon able to adjust and begin focusing on practice by drawing the power from the herb.For the next two hours, the man keeps practicing until night falls. An afternoon of practicing has only led to slight improvement in his inner force. As a matter of fact, the daunting and painstaking process has seen a lot of people give up halfway through their practice.Xu Mu\u2019an opens his eyes and hears a sound from next door, knowing the childe must have come back. The thought of Xiao Jingting instantly fills the man with bitterness, because Xu Mu\u2019an has had to work extremely hard to reach the same level three spirit power as that childe of the Xiao family who, instead, has spent every day of his life on pleasure and never bothered to practice.If he were Xiao Jingting, he would have enjoyed the privilege of bathing in valuable medicine herbs since a young age and had access to all the spiritual plants he ever wanted, which would have empowered him much more\u2026He shakes his head, telling himself to stop thinking about the unrealistic.\u2026Xiao Jingting throws himself into bed, feeling depressed.Having learned that he can use his inner force to farm the land, he can\u2019t wait to try.However, he has failed to find where his farmland is after spending a long time looking for it.Just like the man he was in his previous life, he has no sense of direction in this life, either. This makes Xiao Jingting frustrated, because it\u2019s not like that he could find a Baidu Map in this world!He closes his eyes, thinking about his trip outside. When he was out, he got a lot of disdainful look from other people. And when he walked past some households, the villagers, upon seeing him, even brought their children inside and slam shut their doors. The realization that he has become such a nuisance in the eyes of others gave Xiao Jingting quite a headache.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Xu Mu\u2019an is out before daylight.Xiao Jingting is aware that his male wife has taken a temporary job somewhere and his memory also tells him that the previous degenerate husband has wasted all the three liang of silver ingots which took Xu Mu\u2019an a long time to save.A moment later, Xiao Jingting hears another sound from next door, thinking that Xiao Xiaodong must have got up from bed and started making breakfast.Although Xu Mu\u2019an belongs to the fire group, Xiao Xiaodong belongs to the wood group. However, the boy\u2019s inner force is still weak due to his young age. Xiao Xiaodong has tilled a vegetable garden in the front yard and selected all the seeds by himself.Afraid that Xiao Jingting might steal from his garden, the clever boy has deliberately chosen all the kinds of vegetables the man least likes.Having eaten up all the vegetables he harvested the last time, Xiao Xiaodong decides it\u2019s time to grow a new batch.Xiao Jingting opens the window through which he sees Xiao Xiaodong, with his eyes closed, gesturing near his garden. Xiao Jingting realizes the boy is trying to enforce the magical lines for herb cultivation which can help plants grow. The man is surprised to see that as the boy reads the lines, a scattering of sparkling light falls to the garden like raindrops.Xiao Xiaodong keeps on reading the magical lines near his garden, but his effort has been far from effective.Seeing this, Xiao Jingting\u2019s mind goes back to the day when he and his parents inspected one of their farmlands. As he recalls, his parents also read a few lines and the crop immediately sprouts and grew as high as ten centimeters. But clearly, Xiao Xiaodong is not powerful like that since he\u2019s still a small child\u2026Seeing the boy working hard, Xiao Jingting is tempted to try as well, so he reads the magical lines at the boy\u2019s garden.Immediately, the man sees green sparkles of light raining down from the sky on the garden and all the vegetable seeds in the boy\u2019s garden sprout in an instant.Xiao Jingting feels a surge of excitement, overjoyed by the fact that this new body of his is powerful, at least more powerful than his son.Xiao Xiaodong is taken aback by the sudden sprouting of his vegetables. Soon, the smart boy catches Xiao Jingting standing near the window across him. But before the man could throw an ingratiating smile at the boy, Xiao Xiaodong quickly runs back to his room and locks the door again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Memory tells him that the magical lines cannot be used repeatedly on a farmland because unnaturally fast growth of the seedlings risks reducing soil fertility and depleting its nutrients.The lines always work the best when it\u2019s applied on the intended seedlings for the first time.Xiao Xiaodong gets back inside the room and sits on the side of the bed, his heart pounding fast.Xiao Xiaofan rubs his eyes and sees his brother, asking in a daze, \u201cBig brother, is it daylight?\u201dXiao Xiaodong takes a look at his little brother whose hair got disheveled from sleep and says, \u201cNo, it\u2019s not. Go back to sleep.\u201d\u201cBut I\u2019m hungry.\u201dXiao Xiaodong has anticipated this because the little boy asks for food every day he wakes up.The elder brother fetches a piece of bread and hands it to Xiao Xiaofan, saying, \u201cEat this.\u201dThe younger boy, however, is reluctant to take it, \u201cThe bread tastes so hard. I don\u2019t like it.\u201dXiao Xiaodong feels depressed seeing his brother\u2019s pitiful face.\u201cI smell breakfast,\u201d Xiao Xiaofan gets excited all of a sudden.The look on the older boy\u2019s look immediately changes from depression to resentfulness as he curses Xiao Jingting under his breath for making delicious food every morning but never once had he shared any food with them.\u201cJust go back to sleep,\u201d Xiao Xiaodong tells his brother.But the younger one keeps sniffing and eyeing one of the chairs in the room. Since the boy isn\u2019t tall enough to reach to lock of the door, he needs to step on something to open it.\u201cYou\u2019re forbidden to go,\u201d Xiao Xiaodong warns in a harsh voice, knowing what the boy is thinking about.Xiao Xiaofan bites his fingers, looking at his brother with pleading eyes.After a while, Xiao Xiaodong finally relents. He opens the door and sneaks a peak at Xiao Jingting.Noticing the boy secretively watching him behind the door, the man puts on a nice smile and says, \u201cWant some steamed stuffed buns? Do me a favor and I\u2019ll trade with you.\u201dXiao Xiaodong didn\u2019t expect the man would speak to him, so he pulls inside instantly with caution.Xiao Xiaofan pulls his brother\u2019s arm, begging him, \u201cBig brother, he said if we did him a favor, he\u2019d give us steamed stuffed buns!\u201dXiao Xaodong is a bit exasperated by the tempted look on the boy\u2019s face, \u201cIt\u2019s just stuffed buns. You\u2019re so easy!\u201dXiao Xiaofan blinks, confused, \u201cBig brother, don\u2019t you want to eat stuffed buns? They taste so soft and nice.\u201dXiao Xiaodong doesn\u2019t say anything.Xiao Xiaofan scratches his head before pulling at his brother\u2019s arm and pleading him again, \u201cBig brother, why don\u2019t you ask what kind of favor he needs from us?\u201dXiao Xiaodong looks into the boy\u2019s clear eyes and keeps hesitating. Finally, tempted by the delicious buns, he agrees, \u201cFine.\u201dVisit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Xiao Xiaofan, thrilled, follows his brother out.Xiao Xiaodong keeps his excited brother behind his back and walks up to Xiao Jingting cautiously, \u201cWhat favor?\u201dXiao Jingting is a bit surprised by the boy\u2019s refusal to even call him father, realizing that bad feelings must have run deep between the young boy and the previous Xiao.\u201cI plan to check on the farmlands, but I don\u2019t know where they are. Do you?\u201d the man asks.\u201cNo,\u201d Xiao Xiaofan answers first in an upset voice.Xiao Xiaoding, meanwhile, casts a bitter glance at Xiao Jingting, asking sarcastically, \u201cHaven\u2019t you sold all your farmlands?\u201dThe man feels a bit embarrassed, replying, \u201cNo. There\u2019re still five mu of low-rate lands left.\u201dXiao Xiaodong responds with a cold and accusatory look from which Xiao Jingting can tell he\u2019s despised by his own son.\u201cIf you wanna sell them, just do it. You don\u2019t need to know where they are to do that,\u201d Xiao Xiaodong says with disdain.Xiao Jingting smiles awkwardly, explaining, \u201cIn fact, there\u2019s not much left with almost all the valuables sold after we left the Xiao family. We still got this estate, but if I sell it, we\u2019ll have to sleep on the street. That\u2019s why I want to make some money by planting spiritual plants.\u201dXiao Xiaodong is clearly astonished to hear the man\u2019s words. The boy lowers his head and tries to figure out if Xiao Jingting is being sincere.Although he detests Xiao Jingting, Xiao Xiaodong still holds out the hope that the man can get back from the wrong path in his life. After all, the last thing he wants is that the destitute man someday sells him and his little brother for money.Xiao Xiaofan, however, isn\u2019t nearly as anxious as his big brother. Instead, he grabs a corner of the table with his little hands and keeps staring greedily at the steamed stuffed buns.A moment later, Xiao Xiaodong raises his head and looks at Xiao Jingting, saying, \u201cI know where they are.\u201dXiao Jingting nods, thinking that his elder son is indeed smart and that he must have already checked out the lands.Xiao Xiaodong belongs to the wood group. One time when Xiao Jingting got drunk and beat him and his little brother, the boy secretly hoped that the man would drop dead like his grandparents so that he could inherit the man\u2019s farmlands. But he thought about it later and came to the conclusion that if Xiao Jingting died, the Xiao family would most likely take away the lands instead of giving them to him.\u201cIt\u2019s a bit far away,\u201d says Xiao Xiaodong.\u201cIf you\u2019re willing to take me there, I\u2019ll give you three buns,\u201d Xiao Jingting offers.The boy hesitates for a moment before giving a nod, \u201cDeal.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It is not included in the promised three.\u201d Xiao Jingting didn\u2019t look at Xiao Xiaodong as he rubbed Xiao Xiaofan\u2019s head and said in a flat tone.As soon as Xiao Xiaofan received the bun, he took a big bite and ate it while smiling stupidly at Xiao Jingting.Xiao Xiaodong gave Xiao Jingting a strange look and his mood became very complicated. Xiao Jingting had always had a better attitude towards him than towards his younger brother. Although he was no better than his younger brother, his main attribute was wood, and he looked like Xiao Jingting. Xiao Jingting did not doubt that he was his son, but his younger brother was different.His younger brother not only had a brain problem but also had the main attribute of fire, which was just like his daddy\u2019s. Moreover, because of his brain problem, he couldn\u2019t cultivate at all, so Xiao Jingting\u2019s attitude towards his younger brother had been very bad.Looking at the change in Xiao Jingting\u2019s attitude towards his younger brother, Xiao Xiaodong was relieved but had mixed feelings.\u201cAre you going to visit the field?\u201d Xiao Xiaodong asked.\u201cYes.\u201d Xiao Jingting nodded.\u201cThere is nothing in your field,\u201d Xiao Xiaodong explained.Xiao Jingting was stunned. He had only thought of going to the field to have a look. He had completely forgotten that the eldest young master didn\u2019t farm at all, so the field should be bare now.\u201cSo, let\u2019s go to the street and buy some seeds first?\u201d Xiao Jingting asked tentatively.Hearing about going to the street, Xiao Xiaofan\u2019s eyes became bright and Xiao Xiaodong was also very excited, but in a flash, Xiao Xiaodong threw this idea away.Xiao Xiaodong wasn\u2019t sure how long Xiao Jingting\u2019s \u201cconversion\u201d would last. He was very worried about who Xiao Jingting could encounter on the street. If Xiao Jingting met some of his wily friends and was bullied, he might sell him and his brother.\u201cThere should be extra seeds in the village head\u2019s house. I heard that he planned to sell them in a few days. You can go to the village head\u2019s house and buy them. It will be cheaper than going to the store, and it\u2019s not far away,\u201d Xiao Xiaodong suggested.\u201cThen go with me,\u201d Xiao Jingting conceded.Xiao Jingting had the impression that the village head of Mound Village was pretty fair in his dealings and a person who very much despised what Xiao Jingting had done to Xu Muan and sympathized with his two children.Xiao Xiaodong nodded his head and responded, \u201cFine.\u201dXiao Xiaodong led the way, with Xiao Xiaofan in the front and Xiao Jingting following behind.Xiao Xiaofan\u2019s footsteps were slow and Xiao Jingting could not wait, so he picked Xiao Xiaofan up. Xiao Xiaofan was silly and was very happy in Xiao Jingting\u2019s arms. When Xiao Jingting held Xiao Xiaofan in his arms, Xiao Xiaodong\u2019s eyes became more and more strange as he looked at Xiao Jingting.The village head of Mound Village was called Ding Hong, and looked very majestic.Ding Hong was in his forties and was also a Level 3 Qi Practitioner. His cultivation was already very exceptional for this village.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Xiao Jingting suddenly remembered that the original owner was also an expert in the village. Although the original body owner didn\u2019t like cultivating, he was the young master of a big family, after all. In the original owner\u2019s family, he was forced to focus on training. Although the cultivation of the original body owner was not as good as the cultivation of\u00a0 those geniuses from the big families, it was much better than that of the villagers of the same age in the village.\u201cBuy seeds?\u201d Ding Hong looked at Xiao Jingting in surprise.Xiao Xiaodong nodded and said: \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhat and how many seeds do you want to buy?\u201d Ding Hong asked.\u201cFor about five mu of field,\u201d Xiao Xiaodong said.Ding Hong\u2019s eyes flashed with contempt. Xiao Jingting realized that Ding Hong and the other villagers from Earth Mound Village attached great importance to the field, so Xiao Jingting\u2019s behavior of selling the land was very annoying.Ding Hong took two bags of seeds and said, \u201cTwo liang of silver.\u201dXiao Jingting thanked him, took out two liang of silver and gave it to Ding Hong.Xiao Xiaodong pulled at Xiao Jingting\u2019s sleeve and said, \u201cThe field has been abandoned for a long time. You\u2019d better turn it over. Grandpa Ding has a very powerful earthworm.\u201dXiao Jingting did not understand. Ding Hong took a look at\u00a0 Xiaodong and stipulated to Xiao Jingting coldly, \u201cI rent out one for two hundred copper coins.\u201dXiao Jingting looked at Xiao Xiaodong\u2019s face and knew that earthworms were a good thing and immediately rented them.Xiao Jingting gave Ding Hong four liang of silver: two for the seeds and two as deposit for the earthworms. When they returned the earthworms, they could get back one liang of silver and 200 copper coins. When others rented the earthworms to turn the ground they wouldn\u2019t need to pay such a high deposit. Obviously, Ding Hong did not trust Xiao Jingting very much.Xiao Jingting did not know how to use earthworms but Xiao Xiaodong volunteered to say that he knew, so he gave the bamboo tube with the earthworms to Xiao Xiaodong.The three of them walked a long way before reachung the location of the field.Xiao Jingting squinted his eyes. The field was provided by the family, and he didn\u2019t know if it was intentional or not, but the location of the field was very far away from the residence, and the original owner was most afraid of trouble. If the field was so far away, how could the original body owner be willing to plant it? In any case, it was better to be given a field than not to be given a field at all.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

No matter how smart he is, he still wants to play.\u201dXiao Xiaodong opened the bamboo tube and a golden earthworm flew out. The earthworm soared to more than a meter above the ground and then drilled into the spirit field, turning over the soil.Xiao Jingting looked at this magical scene. He didn\u2019t show it on his face, but he was still surprised in his heart.The efficiency of the earthworms was extremely high, and before long, two mu of land had been turned over. Xiao Xiaodong helped Xiao Jingting plant the seeds together, and the two of them were so busy they lost the track of time.When Xiao Jingting was about to finish, he took out a few steamed buns. Seeing that Xiao Xiaodong was so hardworking, he gave Xiao Xiaodong and Xiao Xiaofan another five buns.When Xu Muan came over, Xiao Jingting and Xiao Xiaodong were just about to finish working.Xu Muan\u2019s eyes were cold when he looked at Xiao Jingting. Xiao Jingting suddenly realized that he had actually used a four-year-old child as a laborer, which was really too much.\u201cDaddy!\u201d Xiao Xiaofan excitedly threw himself into Xu Muan\u2019s arms.Xu Muan hugged Xiao Xiaofan and his strained mood suddenly relaxed.Xu Muan had been worried recently about Xiao Jingting selling his two children. When he came home and found that his two children were gone, he almost went crazy.Xiao Jingting followed Xu Muan home. He secretly observed Xu Muan\u2019s ugly face and did not know how to open his mouth.Xiao Jingting wanted to go home and talk with Xu Muan. As a result, as soon as they came back, Xu Muan closed the door of his room.\u201cYour brother is not sensible, but why are you hanging out with him?\u201d Xu Muan\u00a0 looked at Xiao Xiaodong and asked somewhat uneasily.Xiao Xiaodong rubbed his hands and said: \u201cI think he has changed a lot, and I just made a deal with him. I helped him, and he gave me and my brother steamed buns to eat.\u201dXu Muan could not help feeling a little lonely. His two sons hadn\u2019t eaten such luxurious things for a long time.\u201cHe didn\u2019t do anything else?\u201d Xu Muan asked.Xiao Xiaodong shook his head and reassured him, \u201cNo, he seems to have changed a lot.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t take him lightly, it is not so easy to change someone\u2019s personality. Who knows what he\u2019s up to!\u201d Xu Muan cautioned.Xiao Xiaodong nodded solemnly.\u201cI saw that the vegetables in the vegetable field have emerged a bit. \u201d Xu Muan recalled.The vegetables in this field were planted by Xiao Xiaodong and grew very slowly. However, they could be cooked in less than one month. The previous crop was almost eaten up, but this crop had not yet grown out.\u201cHe did it,\u201d Xiao Xiaodong explained.\u201cWhy?\u201dXiao Xiaodong stuck out his tongue and said, \u201cI think he ran out of the money, so he decided to be self-sufficient.\u201dXu Muan pursed his lips and thought secretly that if Xiao Jingting really did not have enough money, it would be good if he found a way to make money. If Xiao Jingting continued to behave recklessly, it would be troublesome. After selling all the land, he would sell the house too.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201cDaddy, here are two steamed buns, you can eat them.\u201d Xiao Xiaodong took out two tightly wrapped steamed buns.Xu Muan looked at Xiao Xiaodong\u2019s bright eyes and lamented gloomily: \u201cYou eat them.\u201d\u201cI have already eaten,\u201d Xiao Xiaodong said.Xu Muan rubbed Xiao Xiaodong\u2019s head and said, \u201cThen save them for tomorrow.\u201dXiao Xiaodong held Xu Muan\u2019s hand. In the end they ate one steamed bun each.Xiao Xiaodong and Xiao Xiaofan had a tiring day and went to sleep before it became dark. Xu Muan came out and cooked some food. Although the steamed bun was delicious, one could not make him full after all.Hearing Xu Muan\u2019s movements, Xiao Jingting came out. When Xu Muan saw Xiao Jingting, he could not help but raise his vigilance.\u201cSomething wrong?\u201d Xu Muan asked.\u201cI\u2019ve been a little short of money lately,\u201d Xiao Jingting said.Xu Muan bowed his head and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have any silver?\u201d\u201cI heard you sometimes go to the jungle hunting,\u201d Xiao Jingting probed. Xu Muan raised his head, full of vigilance, so Xiao Jingting proposed hurriedly: \u201cCan I go with you?\u201dXu Muan hesitated for a long time before nodding: \u201cAlright\u201dWith Xu Muan\u2019s consent, Xiao Jingting could not help but breathe a sigh of relief.Xiao Jingting went into the room and took out a box with eighteen silver and a few pawn tickets. Xiao Jingting was somewhat relieved to find that the field he had pawned was actually a living pawn, which was much less silver than a dead pawn for two months. Within two months adding two percent of interest, he could get the title deed back.The original body owner was a gambler. When he first pawned the field, he felt that he could win it back by gambling, so when he pawned it, he chose a living pawn.Xiao Jingting put the box away and secretly thought, \u201cThe priority now is to make money as soon as possible, and then buy the fields back.\u201dThe next day, Xu Muan instructed Xiao Xiaodong to take good care of his brother and left for the jungle with Xiao Jingting.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Although Xiao Jingting had long known that many boys in this world were raised as girls, he still felt his scalp going numb when he heard a man talking like this.Seeing the appearance of the person, the memory in Xiao Jingting\u2019s mind was awakened. When Xiao Jingting was in the Xiao family, in addition to Xu Muan, there were also several concubines. The moment he was sent here, these concubines were not happy to follow him and suffer with him, so they all left Xiao Jingting to find another way out.Xiao Jingting was a man who was not willing to be lonely. After he came to Mound Village, he tried to hook up with a few nice young brothers from the village. Most of them ignored Xiao Jingting, but there were always some exceptions, Qiu Bai was one of them.Xiao Jingting was flattered to receive compliments and Qiu Bai was good at taking what he liked. Xiao Jingting was coaxed and spent a lot of money on Qiu Bai. Qiu Bai was also a capable person and took Xiao Jingting\u2019s money but did not allow him to take any advances.\u201cI\u2019m going to the jungle,\u201d Xiao Jingting said faintly.\u201cGoing to the jungle? Brother Xiao, ah, it\u2019s so dangerous! How can you go to a place like this?\u201d Qiu Bai was shocked. Qiu Bai looked at Xu Muan with reproachful eyes.\u201cI have no money. If I don\u2019t go to the jungle, I will starve to death. It\u2019s better to try my luck in the jungle,\u201d Xiao Jingting said lighty.Xu Muan looked at Xiao Jingting strangely. Xiao Jingting was the most sensitive about his reputation and liked showing off, but this time he actually directly said that he had no money.Qiu Bai reluctantly smiled and said, \u201cBrother Xiao, stop joking around, didn\u2019t you just sell your fields? That is a lot of money.\u201d\u201cLost all of it.\u201d Xiao Jingting had the good sense to not say he bought Xiaoyao powder, so he directly claimed he lost it.Qiu Bai covered his mouth and revealed a look of surprise. \u201cBrother Jingting, ah, tough luck! Don\u2019t worry, you\u2019re born to be lucky! You can always win back a thousand gold.\u201d\u201cNo more, I\u2019m quitting.\u201d Xiao Jingting was indifferent.Xiao Jingting was one of the top teenagers in his previous life! He refused to gamble, refused drugs, and refused pornography, but this body owner\u2019s life was all about gambling, whoring and taking drugs. How could he transmigrate as such a scum?\u201cLet\u2019s go! Let\u2019s go early and come back early,\u201d Xiao Jingting urged Xu Muan.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Xu Muan nodded and answered, \u201cAlright.\u201dXu Muan had thought that if Qiu Bai showed up, Xiao Jingting would give up the idea of going to the jungle, but the other person mind was quite firm. Qiu Bai watched Xiao Jingting and Xu Muan leaving and his eyes flashed with contempt.\u201cHow\u2019d it go, brother?\u201d Qiu Li came out.Qiu Bai shook his head and said with some regret, \u201cHe already lost everything. He really is a black sheep. No wonder he was driven out of the Xiao family. When he came he had several hundred silver and so many fields. As a result\u2026 \u201c Originally, he wanted to take advantage of it. He didn\u2019t want this guy to lose it so fast.\u201cThis idiot is really wasteful, and so are you, brother. I asked you to go to him before, but you pushed him around. As a result, now he has spent all his money and we couldn\u2019t get anything.\u201d Qiu Li was dissatisfied.Qiu Bai bowed his head and secretly thought that\u00a0before he had a little conflict with Xiao Jingting, so he wanted to ignore Xiao Jingting for a few days, but as a result Xiao Jingting spent all his money in these few days.\u201cBrother, do you think he is lying? There was no reason to spend all this silver at once,\u201d Qiu Bai said, thinking that Xiao Jingting was probably annoyed with him, so he said that on purpose.\u201cIt should be true. A few of my friends said that Xiao Jingting was hanging out in the city in the brothel and in the gambling houses, and he also got involved with Xiaoyao powder. These things are very expensive. This loser should have burned up all his silver before going to the jungle,\u201d Qiu Li said.Qiu Bai\u2019s eyes flickered with disdain. When Xiao Jingting first arrived at Mound Village, his reputation was still extremely good. He was good looking and strong and owned 20 mu of farmland and had a good house. Unfortunately, before long, people found out that Xiao Jingting was lazy and unreliable.Qiu Bai originally wanted to marry Xiao Jingting as his main wife, but after discovering Xiao Jingting\u2019s true face, he immediately dispelled this idea.Xiao Jingting followed behind Xu Muan and couldn\u2019t help but feel a bit dejected. His relationship with Xu Muan had only eased up a bit with much difficulty. Just now that Qiu Bai made a scene and as a result, Xu Muan\u2019s face seemed to get even worse.\u201cThe jungle is very dangerous. We should only move on the outskirts,\u201d Xu Muan warned.Xiao Jingting nodded hurriedly, and agreed, \u201cI know.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If you are bitten, you will be paralyzed. Be careful.\u201d Xu Muan said.Xiao Jingting nodded and said with lingering fear, \u201cI know.\u201d The jungle was really dangerous. No wonder, although there were many treasures hidden in the jungle, few people would come to the jungle.Xiao Jingting followed Xu Muan in the jungle for a long time, and there was no harvest till, \u201cGrapes.\u201dXu Muan turned to look at Xiao Jingting and said, \u201cWhat?\u201dXiao Jingting pointed to the grapevines in the mountains and said, \u201cI want to bring back some grapevines to transplant them.\u201dThere were two strings of grapes hanging on a grapevine in front of Xu Muan. Xu Muan wanted to say that this wild grape ware very sour and even if he planted them, no one would eat them. However, looking at Xiao Jingting cheerful appearance, Xu Muan thought it was no good idea to pour cold water on him.Xiao Jingting remembers that the status of fruit in this world was very special. If he can grow a lot of delicious grapes, he will earn a lot of silver.Xiao Jingting put the grapevines into the basket and secretly transferred some of them into his space.Xu Muan did not see Xiao Jingting movements and stood on guard on the side.\u201cRun quickly, the toot- piercing Pig is here.\u201dIn an instant, a wild boar with a body length of nearly two meters ran to the two men. Xiao Jingting looked at the giant beast in front of him and swallowed his saliva secretly. Was it still a pig? It was two meters long with a pair of tusks shining with metallic luster and on the pigskin, there was turtle-shell-like Armour.Xu Muan launched a fire attack on the tooth-piercing pig. The speed of the tooth-piercing pig movement was extremely fast, and Xu Muan attacks all missed.The tooth-piercing pig shouted twice and rushed toward Xu Muan.Xiao Jingting spawned a vine that hooked the trunk of the tree, hugged Xu Muan waist, and rose to the top of the tree, half holding Xu Muan.Xu Muan brain went blank for a moment when he was hugged by Xiao Jingting.\u201cBoom boom\u201d tooth-piercing pig crazily hit the trunk of the tree, which brought Xu Muan back to his senses.\u201cDoes this pig know you?\u201d Xiao Jingting thought it was a bit strange.\u201cI once hunted a rabbit, which seemed to be his favorite prey.\u201d Xu Muan said. The tooth-piercing pig at the bottom of the tree was also 3 level Qi practitioner. It\u2019s very difficult to deal with because of its armor, and its immunity to fire attack.Xiao Jingting: \u201c\u2026\u201d There are rabbits on this pig menu? This world! It was so hard to understand.\u201cCan it climb trees?\u201d Xiao Jingting asked.Xu Muan shook his head and said: \u201cNo.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d Xiao Jingting breathed a sigh of relief.\u201cBoom.\u201d Xiao Jingting felt the shudder of the big tree and big tree trembled again.Xiao Jingting saw that tooth-piercing pig under the tree will soon break the tree so he controlled the vines and leaped to another tree with Xu Muan.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201cIf we can kill this big guy, we can have better food.\u201d Xiao Jingting said with bright eyes, the strength of the pig below was not low, and the spiritual power contained in the meat could not be low. Eating such a beast could improve their cultivation.Xu Muan couldn\u2019t help feeling moved. He was not the opponent for this tooth-piercing pig alone, but now he was not alone.\u201cRoar\u2026\u201d tooth-piercing pig roared at Xiao Jingting and Xu Muan.\u201cI\u2019ll trip it up and you will attack it in the eyes.\u201d Xiao Jingting saidXu Muan nodded and replied: \u201cgood.\u201dXiao Jingting mobilized his spiritual power and spawned countless vines to wrap around the legs of the tooth-piercing pig. The tooth-piercing pig roared angrily and the vines that wrap around the tooth-piercing pig were almost broken.Xiao Jingting constantly spawned vines and affected the movement of the tooth-piercing pig and Xu Muan took this opportunity to attack pig eyes, then when the angry pig roared, Xu Muan took this opportunity to throw a fireball into the pig\u2019s mouth.The tooth-piercing pig rampaged, its body actually increasing in size out of thin air.\u201cIt\u2019s gone berserk.\u201d Xu Muan was shocked.The berserked tooth-piercing pig eyes were red like blood and its strength had doubled. It looked bloodthirsty. Xiao Jingting crazily mobilized his spiritual power, hindering the action of the toothed pig, and Xu Muan no longer retained it.The tooth-piercing pig slammed into the big tree where Xiao Jingting and Xu Muan stood.Although there were many trees in the jungle, only a few that could withstand the impact of tooth-piercing pig. The tooth-piercing pig screamed loudly when Xiao Jingting narrowly escaped with Xu Muan to another tree.Xiao Jingting maneuvered a branch and ruthlessly pierced it in the back of tooth-piercing pig, the pig screamed loudly that Xu Muan was startled by Xiao Jingting movement.\u201cDo it quickly.\u201d Xiao Jingting urged.Xu Muan threw a fireball toward tooth-piercing pig and the two of them worked together to kill tooth-piercing pig.Seeing tooth-piercing pig fall to the ground, Xu Mian breathed a sigh of relief. This time he thought Xiao Jingting would drag him down and did not expect him to help. Xu Muan could not help but start treating Xiao Jingting a little differently.\u201cIt\u2019s getting smaller.\u201d Xiao Jingting looked at the corpse of the tooth-piercing pig.\u201cIt died and the berserking ended, so it naturally became smaller.\u201d Xu Muan faintly said.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The fatigue in his body was swept away, and the depleted spiritual energy was quickly replenished.As far as Xiao Jingting knew, there was a rejuvenation pill on the market that could replenish the depleted spiritual energy, but this kind of rejuvenation pill was expensive. Even the poor quality one needed two silver but the spiritual spring in his jade pendant was endless.There were endless crises in the jungle, and it was dangerous to have a depleted spiritual power in here.Xiao Jingting looked over towards Xu Muan\u2019s face that was pale and his eyes were somewhat worried, Xiao Jingting was well aware that when fighting against tooth-piercing pig just now Xu Muan\u2019s spiritual power was almost completely depleted.\u201cI\u2019ll clean up.\u201d Xiao Jingting leaped down the tree and collected the pig.\u201cLet\u2019s go back.\u201d Xiao Jingting looked at Xu MuanXu Muan looked at Xiao Jingting\u2019s lively appearance and was very surprised at the amount of the spiritual power in Xiao Jingting body. Xu Muan was also worried, such a big pig could be exchanged for a lot of silver. However, according to Xiao Jingting personality, he wouldn\u2019t be able to get a single silver for himself.Xu Muan purses his lips and suppressed his anxiety. Now that his spiritual power was exhausted, it was already good to be able to save his own life, the tooth-piercing pig belonged to Xiao Jingting, so let him have it.Xiao Jingting looked at Xu Muan and said, \u201cWe have to leave as soon as possible. Can you still walk?\u201dXu Muan nodded and said, \u201cYes.\u201d Although his spiritual power was almost exhausted, it was not a problem to walk back.Afraid to expose his space, Xiao Jingting spawned some branches and made a rattan net to drag tooth-piercing pig back.Fearing that the boar would attract unwanted attention, Xiao Jingting made a detour avoiding the crowd going back to his house.\u201cDaddy, what a big pig!\u201d Seeing Xu Muan and Xiao Jingting coming back, Xiao Xiaofan, who was eating wild vegetables, shouted excitedly.Xiao Jingting took a look at Xu Muan and said, \u201cHalf of the pig will be cooked, let\u2019s sell the other half of the pig.\u201dXu Muan nodded and said, \u201cAll right.\u201d Although the tooth-piercing pig was delicious and could replenish spiritual power, it also easily deteriorate. To eat half of it for the whole family, it was enough.\u201cI heard that you are the friend of the owner of the Yue restaurant. You can sell it to him tomorrow morning.\u201d Xiao Jingting continued.Xu Muan looked at Xiao Jingting in sunrise and answered, \u201cAll right.\u201dXiao Jingting cooked a large pot of braised pork and invited Xu Muan and his two sons to eat together. The four of them eat till their mouth was full of grease.When Xu Muan was eating meat, he felt that his body was getting filled with spiritual power, and he become excited.Xu Muan looked at Xiao Jingting, who was burying his head in bowl with a satisfied expression.Xu Muan looked at this strange Xiao Jingting and felt a little warmer.\u201cDaddy, you eat a lot for dinner!\u201d Xiao Xiaofan looked up at Xu Muan and mumbled.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Xu Muan could not help blushing for a moment. Xiao Jingting meat was very delicious so he unconsciously ate a lot. Xiao Xiaofan and Xiao Xiaodong didn\u2019t eat much. The spirit power in the boar meat was very strong, and was not something that Xiao Xiaofan and Xiao Xiaodong could bear. After they ate only a few pieces of meat, Xiao Jingting asked them to have some porridge.The porridge Xiao Xiaodong and Xiao Xiaofan ate was also cooked by Xiao Jingting, although the taste was not as good as braised meat, but for Xiao Xiaodong and Xiao Xiaofan, who usually ate dry noodles, it was already a supreme delicacy. \u201cDaddy worked so hard, it is alright to eat more.\u201d Xiao Xiaodong said.Xiao Xiaofan nodded, smacked his lips, and said, \u201cWell, Daddy should eat more. The food cooked by father is really delicious, and better than that what Daddy made.\u201d\u201cHe ate so many delicacies that he can make them.\u201d Xiao Xiaodong said in a dissatisfying way.Xu Muan bowed his head, he tossed over and over but couldn\u2019t cook well. No wonder his son disliked him.\u201cDaddy, father asked you to sell pig! Half a pig, should be able to sell for more than ten silver. When it\u2019s sold, you should hide some of the silver. \u201d Xiao Xiaodong suggested.Xu Muan glanced at Xiao Xiaodong and thought the same way. There was no money in his hand, which always made him feel uneasy. Although Xiao Jingting seemed to have changed a lot, who knew when this person would change back.Early in the morning, Xu Muan woke up.Xu Muan opened the door and found that Xiao Jingting was also up. He was in the yard, tossing the grape trellis.\u201cGoing to sell pig?\u201d Xiao Jingting asked.Xu Muan nodded and said, \u201cYes, selling it as soon as possible can get a better price.\u201dXiao Jingting nodded and said, \u201cGo quickly.\u201dXu Muan looked at Xiao Jingting and left with half of the pig.\u201cWait a minute.\u201d Xiao Jingting stopped Xu Muan.Xu Muan turned his head, looked at Xiao Jingting, and asked, \u201cwhat can I do for you?\u201dXiao Jingting smiled and said, \u201cThere is no rice at home, nor eggs. It is all gone, go and buy some. The two children are still young, and it\u2019s not good for them to always eat dry noodles.\u201dXu Muan nodded and said, \u201cAll right.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They ate pork yesterday, and both brothers had some excess energy.The two brothers lay at the window and watched Xu Muan leave, then observed the movement of Xiao Jingting.\u201cBrother, what is he doing?\u201d Xiao Xiaofan asked curiously.Xiao Xiaodong tilted his head and said, \u201cHe seems to be growing grapes.\u201d\u201cGrowing grapes?\u201d Xiao Xiaofan\u2019s face twisted.\u201cGrapes? Grapes are sour. I don\u2019t eat them. \u201d Xiao Xiaofan said, puffing his cheeks.Xiao Xiaodong sneered and said, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t plant it for you to eat. Even if you wanted to eat them you may not be able to.\u201dXiao Xiaofan bulged his cheek and glared angrily at Xiao Xiaodong.Xiao Jingting looked towards Xiao Xiaodong and Xiao Xiaofan. Xiao Xiaodong sensed Xiao Jingting gaze and closed the window before taking Xiao Xiaofan to hide.Xiao Jingting thought secretly: the shadow left by the predecessor was very difficult to eliminate! It would take some time.If people in the village wanted to go to the city, most of them would take the Li family\u2019s ox cart and Xu Muan was no exception. When Xu Muan hunted more prey he would take ox cart of Li Sheng.\u201cWhat a big pig! Half of it is already so big, a whole one must be amazing! \u201d Li Sheng was envious.Xu Muan nodded and said, \u201cYes!\u201d\u201cAre you going to sell this half of pig?\u201d Li Sheng asked.Xu Muan nodded and said, \u201cYes!\u201d\u201cSuch a big pig can sell for more than ten silver. Did you hunt it?\u201d Qiu Bai asked.Xu Muan looked at the people coming out of the cart and frowned. Qiu Bai often followed the ox cart to the city. Xu Muan had never bumped into him before, but this time he did.Afraid of getting into trouble, Xu Muan nodded directly and said, \u201cYes!\u201d I hunted it. \u201d\u201cIt\u2019s amazing, but there is only a half of it! If it were sold as a whole one, you would be able to earn dozens of silver ingots.\u201d\u201cWe ate the other half.\u201d Xu Muan said.Qiu Bai said jealousy, \u201cThis pig spiritual power is very rich, it must be delicious.\u201dXu Muan nodded and said, \u201cIt\u2019s delicious.\u201d Qiu Bai had an affair with Xiao Jingting and always came to him when he had nothing to do. Xu Muan looked at this person and found him very unpleasant, but there was nothing he could do.\u201cAll right, all right, let\u2019s get in the cart, it\u2019s time for us to go.\u201d Li Sheng said.The ox cart traveled for over an hour before it arrived in city.Xu Muan sold the pig to the restaurant and took the money to buy rice, noodles and eggs, as well as some clothes. The clothes on his two sons were torn and he had some money on hand. Xu Muan didn\u2019t want them to wear that anymore.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.When Xu Muan came home, he saw the yard full of lush grapevines.A strong smell of meat floated out of the house.Xu Muan opened the door and saw Xiao Jingting, who was stirring in the pot. Xiao Jingting took a look at Xu Muan and said: \u201cYou\u2019re back. The food will be ready soon.\u201dXu Muan nodded and replied, \u201cGood.\u201dXiao Jingting made a big pot of stir-fried meat and bamboo shoots this time, Xiao Xiaodong and Xiao Xiaofan couldn\u2019t eat too much meat, but it was all right if they could eat more bamboo shoots that were tainted with the taste of meat.Xu Muan ate meat and secretly thought: Xiao Jingting cooking is really good, but what had got into his head that he even invited him and his sons to eat together.Seeing that Xiao Jingting was in a good mood, Xu Muan took out 12 silver ingots and said, \u201cI got 16 silver ingots from selling the pig and, spent 4 silver ingots, there is still 12 left.\u201dXiao Jingting put away six silver ingots and said, \u201cYou can put the rest away, I didn\u2019t expect this pig to be worth this much.\u201dXu Muan nodded and said with a bit of a guilty conscience, \u201cAll right.\u201dAfraid that Xiao Jingting would take all the money, Xu Muan lied that he earned 16 silver ingots instead of 18. Unexpectedly, Xiao Jingting didn\u2019t even notice and also divided it into half. Although Xu Muan was guilty, he still didn\u2019t confess. He had two children to take care of and needed to be on guard.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Eat quickly!\u201d Xiao Jingting looked at Xu Muan and said.Xu Muan nodded and ate.\u201cThe meat is so tasty!\u201d Xiao Jingting couldn\u2019t help but say. In his previous life, he liked eating meat because meat was delicious, but in this life, eating meat could increase his strength, and if he ate meat for every meal, his spiritual power would rise. No wonder the strength of those big families raised so rapidly.\u201cYes! Yeah! It\u2019s so comfortable to eat meat. The meat is delicious.\u201d Xiao Xiaofan said.Xiao Jingting stretched out his hand and rubbed Xiao Xiaofan head.Seeing Xiao Jingting gentle look, Xu Muan hesitated for a moment, and then swallowed the matter of meeting Qiu Bai.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Going out to play?\u201d Xiao Xiaofan pounced over and hugged Xiao Jingting\u2019s leg.Recently Xiao Xiaofan and Xiao Jingting were getting along well with each other. Xiao Xiaofan was very fond of this father who always gave him delicious food.Xiao Xiaodong repeatedly asked Xiao Xiaofan to be on guard against Xiao Jingting. Xiao Xiaofan was stupid and forgetful so when he saw Xiao Jingting, he always forgot Xiao Xiaodong\u2019s advice.\u201cPlay, play, play, that\u2019s the only thing on your mind.\u201d Xiao Xiaodong tugged on Xiao Xiaofan\u2019s arm. He was a little angry.Xiao Jingting rubbed Xiao Xiaofan\u2019s face and said, \u201cDaddy need to go to fields to water the plants.\u201d In the last two days, the food in their house improved a lot, Xiao Xiaofan seemed to have gained some weight, but he was still thin, making Xiao Jingting feel a little distressed.Xiao Xiaodong secretly sized up Xiao Jingting and thought in his heart:\u00a0Xiao Jingting used to hate farming, but now he is more and more diligent.\u201cI\u2019ll go, too.\u201d Xiao Xiaofan said.Xiao Xiaodong glanced at Xiao Xiaofan and asked \u201cIf you go, what are you going to do?\u201dXiao Xiaofan blushed a little and said, \u201cI\u2019ll show dad the way.\u201d\u201cDo you know the way?\u201dXiao Xiaodong asked.Xiao Xiaofan blushed and said, \u201cYes, I do.\u201dXiao Jingting looked at Xiao Xiaofan and said, \u201cIf Xiaofan wants to go together, let\u2019s go together.\u201dXiao Xiaodong looked at Xiao Jingting and held his head high as he said, \u201cI\u2019ll go too.\u201dXiao Jingting looked at Xiao Xiaodong with a look of surprise.Xiao Jingting took a few more buns and put them in the basket, he only brought one person\u2019s ration. If two children went with him he should prepare more.Xiao Jingting looked at Xu Muan and said, \u201cI\u2019m afraid that I won\u2019t be back until the afternoon, so you cook some more of that pork.\u201dXu Muan nodded and answered with yes but his heart was little uneasy. After tooth-piercing pig was dragged back, it was all handled by Xiao Jingting. The meat made by the other side was much better than what was made by him. His skill in cooking the meat was fine, but it was difficult to make it more delicious.Xu Muan was preoccupied when Xiao Xiaofan and Xiao Xiaodong had already followed Xiao Jingting outside.Xu Muan looks at the back of the three of them and showed a warm smile.Xiao Xiaofan tagged on Xiao Jingting robe and jumped around, while Xiao Xiaodong with a straight face, followed them.Looking at how close his father had become with his younger brother, Xiao Xiaodong heart was sour. Obviously father used to love him more, but now he liked his younger brother better. However, it\u2019s better if he liked his younger brother than someone else\u2019s child. When they were still in Xiao family house, his father used to be very nice to those nieces and nephews but he didn\u2019t like them.Qiu Bai looked at Xiao Jingting, Xiao Xiaofan and Xiao Xiaodong laughing and walking together and his face couldn\u2019t help looking a bit strange.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Qiu Bai had the impression that Xiao Jingting disliked his two children very much. He even told him that Xiao Xiaofan was a barstard and that Xu Muan slept with someone else and that he was cockolded\u2026..\u201cJingting.\u201d Qiu Bai called out.Seeing Qiu Bai, Xiao Xiaodong quickly stepped forward and walked to Xiao Jingting left-hand side, pulling Xiao Jingting clothes, Xiao Xiaofan also surrounded Xiao Jingting from the right side.Xiao Jingting looked at Xiao Xiaodong\u2019s appearance like he was facing an enemy and was somewhat amused, \u201cQiu Bai, is something wrong?\u201dQiu Bai shook his head and said, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, just congratulating you on hunting such a big boar, it must have been sold for dozens of silver.\u201dXiao Jingting immediately understood Qiu Bai intention, He was interested in the silver Xiao Jingting sold the pig for, \u201cNot like that. It\u2019s sold only a dozen of silver. I just wanted to eat pork.\u201d\u201cA dozen of silver, that\u2019s a lot too, enough to support your family for a long time.\u201d Qiu Bai was filled with envy as he looked at Xiao Jingting and lowered his head, revealing a lonely look.If it was the original body owner, looking at Qiu Bai appearance, he would have asked Qiu Bai what was bothering him, but Xiao Jingting kept his mouth shut.Qiu Bai was waiting for Xiao Jingting to ask a question so that he could go on, but he didn\u2019t expect that Xiao Jingting would remain silent, so he could only say, \u201cJingting, my brother wants to get married. But his future family in law asked for a bride price of 20 silver ( Price that future husband needs to pay to his future in law in order to marry). My family doesn\u2019t have enough money, can you lend me five silver?\u201cI don\u2019t have silver.\u201d Xiao Jingting shook his head.Qiu Bai looked down and said, \u201cJingting, if you don\u2019t want to lend me the money, just tell me. Why do you say you don\u2019t have money? Didn\u2019t you just sell the pig? \u201d Xu Muan hunted the wild boar; it was absolutely impossible to hide it from Xiao Jingting, with Xiao Jingting temperament, the money for selling pig must have fallen into his hands.\u201cI owed a lot of gambling debt before. I used the money from selling pig to pay off some of them and I still have a lot to repay.\u201d Xiao Jingting sighed.Qiu Bai said with a voice filled with sorrow, \u201cWhat can I do? Without this money, my brother won\u2019t be able to marry a wife.\u201d\u201cThen let your brother get a cheaper wife to marry, then!\u201d Xiao Jingting said in an indifferent way.He himself was having a hard time, so where did he find the leisure to care about other people\u2019s elder brother getting married? What does his wife have to do with him? His wife wasn\u2019t settled it yet.Qiu Bai looked at Xiao Jingting with a look full of bitterness and said, \u201cBut my brother really like the girl from that family.\u201d\u201cOh, your brother likes that girl so much, then he will definitely find a way. I still have things to do and I can\u2019t talk to you anymore.\u201d Xiao Jingting led Xiao Xiaofan and Xiao Xiaodong away.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It\u2019s not good to owe people money, so I\u2019m trying to find a way to pay off my debt. \u201d\u201cDad, how are you going to pay your debts?\u201d Xiao Xiaofan asked curiously.\u201cWork hard in farming and hunting, and I should be able to pay it off after a while.\u201d Xiao Jingting was confident.Xiao Xiaofan nodded his head and raised his little fist to cheer Xiao Jingting up, \u201cDad, it will definitely be paid off soon.\u201dXiao Xiaodong rolled his eyes around. No one knew what was on his mind.When Xiao Jingting went to the edge of the field and made use of the Falling Rain Technique to plant grapes, Xiao Jingting discovered that the spiritual spring in the space could promote the growth of Spiritual plants so when casting Falling Rain Technique Xiao Jingting pulled out a portion of the spiritual water from the space and incorporated it into the spiritual rain.Xiao Xiaodong couldn\u2019t take his eyes off Xiao Jingting\u2019s movements. The Spiritual Secrets and books used for cultivation ware passed down in the family, Xiao Xiaodong had the right to learn Xiao family secrets, however, he was too young and only learned low-level technique.\u201cFather, you\u2019re amazing! If this goes on, the harvest this time will be very good.\u201d It was a pity that the other middle and upper-class fields had been sold by father, otherwise the quality of the spiritual plants grown would be even better.Xiao Jingting smiled proudly and said, \u201cIs that right?\u201dXiao Xiaodong nodded and said, \u201cYes!\u201d and then secretly thought:\u00a0If he had Xiao Jingting ability, it would be enough to plant all of the vegetable fields.After watering the three mu of fields, it was already noon, and Xiao Jingting showed off his unique fishing skills by catching several fish. The eyes of those two little kids were full of surprise.Xiao Jingting gave two kids two steamed buns and roasted a fish for each of them.Children in this world ate a lot of food. They wouldn\u2019t starve if they eat less but they would become stronger if they aat more, especially food containing spiritual power.After applying rain to the field, Xiao Jingting returned home with the two kids.\u201cWelcome back. It time for dinner:\u201d Xu Muan greeted.Xiao Jingting nodded and said, \u201cOK!\u201dXu Muan looked at Xiao Jingting\u2019s face while he ate.Although Xu Muan\u2019s craftsmanship was not very good, Xiao Jingting was not picky about food and the meat from the pig was very rich in spiritual power, coupled with the fact that he ate ready-made rice, Xiao Jingting still ate a lot.\u201cMy cooking is not very good.\u201d Xu Muan said apologetically.Xiao Jingting looked up at Xu Muan and said, \u201cYou\u2019re wrong, it is very delicious.\u201dXu Muan heart felt warm as he thought to himself: if only Xiao Jingting could go on like this, that would be good.\u201dVisit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Xiao Xiaofan nibbled the meat and looked at Xiao Jingting, saying, \u201cFather\u2019s cooking is better than that of Daddy, Daddy cooking isn\u2019t very good.\u201dXiao Jingting did not appreciate Xiao Xiaofan truthfulness, \u201cIt\u2019s not delicious, but you still eat so happily.\u201d\u2026Xiao Xiaofan was tired of playing and fallen asleep on the bed.\u201cDaddy.\u201d Xiao Xiaodong sat on the bed cross-legged and looked at Xu Muan seriously.\u201cYes?\u201d Asked Xu Muan.\u201cWhen we went out today, we met Qiu Bai.\u201dXu Muan face suddenly tightened. Qiu Bai must have seen him selling pig so he showed up; \u201cHas he found your father?\u201dXiao Xiaodong nodded and said, \u201cYes, he said his brother wanted to get married, and his future wife bride price was 20 silver. Their family didn\u2019t have enough money so he asked father to lend him five silver.\u201dXu Muan could not help clenching his fist. Five silver, Qiu Bai really thought that the silver in their family was brough by the wind.\u201cDid your father agree?\u201d Xu Muan asked, In the past, Xiao Jingting was most pitying for young beauties.Qiu Bai begged him with few words so Xiao Jingting might have agreed.Xiao Xiaodong shook his head and said, \u201cNo, my father said he wanted to pay back his gambling debts, so he has no money. Daddy, do you think my father really owes the gambling debt outside? Do you think he owes too much money out there, so, he doesn\u2019t dare to go out!\u201dXu Muan clenched his teeth and immediately became uneasy. Gambling debt was different from ordinary debt. It usually had a very high-interest rate. He didn\u2019t even want to think how high it could become.Gambling houses always raised a lot of tugs and when the time came they would go to families who borrowed money to smash and rob them. if Xiao Jingting really borrowed money from the gambling house, then\u2026Xu Muan closed his eyes and said, \u201cLet me think about it.\u201dIf Xiao Jingting could always be like this in the past few days, it wouldn\u2019t matter if he helped Xiao Jingting to pay off his gambling debts.

He was the \u201cbest friend\u201d of the original body owner. The original body owner\u2019 gambling and addiction to Happy Powder were all thanks to this Wang Erhu. Fortunately, he came early, otherwise, the original body owner after fooling around in gambling house for few more days would made his wife and children lose their house.Xiao Jingting always felt that Wang Erhu getting close to the original owner might have been premeditated. After all, the original body owner had done a lot of harmful things. Now that it was impossible for Xiao Jingting\u2019s original enemies to let him go.Wang Erhu looked at Xiao Jingting and said, \u201cBrother Xiao, you have a nice house.\u201dXiao Jingting smiled and said, \u201cNo matter how good the house in the country is, how good can it be? Such a big house isn\u2019t even worth a dilapidated house in the city.\u201dXiao Xiaofan stood beside Xiao Jingting and looked at Wang Erhu curiously.\u201cBrother Xiao, this is Xiaofan, isn\u2019t it? He\u2019s so cute! Unfortunately, he is a fool.\u201d Wang Erhu sighed.Xiao Xiaofan looked eagerly towards Xiao Jingting. Xiao Jingting held out his hand and rubbed Xiao Xiaofan head, the original body owner scolded Xiao Xiaofan for being a wild seed in front of Wang Erhu, making him so unscrupulous now.\u201cBrother Wang, if you are doing well staying in the city, why did you come to the countryside?\u201d Xiao Jingting asked.\u201cI haven\u2019t seen Brother Xiao for several days and was worried and came over to take a look. I heard that your wife is fierce. I thought you may be detained by your wife.\u201d Wang Erhu said half-jokingly.There was a sneer in Xiao Jingting heart, was Wang Erhu sowing discord?\u201cBrother Wang worries too much. I\u2019m really short of money these days when I stay in the countryside so I am ashamed to go to the city.\u201d Xiao Jingting shook his head.\u201cNo way. Brother Xiao is the young master of the Xiao family, he might not be out of money so soon.\u201dWang Erhu tone was full of surprise.\u201cHateful, those people in the Xiao family are all praising the high and trampling on the low. When my parents were around, they took care of me in every way. Now that my parents are gone, they have all revealed their true face. They have assigned me to this desolate and barren place, and they have only given me so little silver that there is not enough money to eat.\u201d Xiao Jingting was full of anger.Wang Erhu looked at Xiao Jingting and said, \u201cI heard that Brother Xiao, you are farming these days? How can you do that job? When I came here, I calculated a fortune for you, Brother Xiao, you are very lucky today, if you go to the gambling house and gamble, you will definitely get rich.\u201dXiao Jingting waved his hand and said, \u201cTo tell you the truth, brother Wang. I can\u2019t afford to win or lose now so I won\u2019t take the risk.\u201dWhen Wang Erhu looked at Xiao Jingting, he only felt that he had not seen him for a few days but. Xiao Jingting seemed to become a different person. Before that, Xiao Jingting was an idiot who after his encouragement would probably have gone with him, but now he has such an unyielding attitude.Wang Erhu looked at Xiao Xiaofan and said, \u201cBrother Xiao, although your son is silly, he looks good!\u201dVisit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Xiao Xiaofan recently ate much better than before and put on some weight so he looked very lovely.Xiao Jingting smiled but didn\u2019t speak.\u201cBrother Xiao, do you know? The Zhou family is recruiting the child servant for the young master of their family, each of whom will get 30 silver. If your son tries it, he will probably win the selection. \u201d Wang Erhu said.Xiao Jingting smiled coldly and said, \u201cI\u2019m not at the point of selling my son yet.\u201d The head of the Zhou family was an expert at the seventh level of qi practice, the Zhou family was nothing compared to the Xiao family, but to the current Xiao Jingting it was still a giant.Thirty silver for a child was really a lot of money, so much silver meant that child must sign a deed of sale when he came into the Zhou family. The way it was said from Wang Erhu mouth, it reeked of conspiracy.\u201cXiaofan, is a little foolish, if it is discovered by Zhou family they would this that I was deceiving them. I won\u2019t be able to find a way out from it.\u201d Xiao Jingting shook his head.\u201cIf Xiaofan can\u2019t do it, isn\u2019t there still a Xiaodong? It\u2019s not a bad thing, if he\u2019s chosen by the Zhou family and get the appreciation of little young master, then he\u2019ll be eating and drinking well with Young Master Zhou.\u201d Wang Erhu voice was full of envy.Xiao Jingting laughed coldly in his heart, Wang Erhu this guy really tried to look like he was thinking about him, this matter mostly had an inside story.\u201cXiaodong can\u2019t do it. I\u2019m counting on Xiaodong to support the family in the future, the work in this field will be counted on him in the future.\u201d Xiao Jingting shook his head.\u201cCounting on him to support family, didn\u2019t you say that this kid will not grow to anything good?\u201d Wang Erhu said.Xiao Jingting said disapprovingly, \u201cHe is a child, I just need to take good care of him.\u201dWang Erhu rambled to\u00a0 Xiao Jingting for a long time but did not gain any advantage so he left gloomily.As soon as Wang Erhu left, Xiao Jingting found that the relaxed atmosphere at home became tense again. Xiao Xiaodong hid Xiao Xiaofan in his room and guarded him all day long.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He heard that the young master of the Zhou family had a bad temper, and many of the children who entered the Zhou family had disappeared without a trace, and even their bodies couldn\u2019t be found.The Zhou family was so powerful that most of the young servants recruited were from poor families with no power. When the children entered the door they signed the deed of sale and when these children disappeared, those adults did not dare to ask the Zhou family to give them an explaination.Thirty silver, a third level tooth-piercing pig was not worth this price. If the Zhou family spent such a large sum to recruit children servants, he was afraid that there was a big problem!\u201cYour father didn\u2019t promise that man.\u201d Xu Muan asked.Wang Erhu and Xu Muan had also met each other, In Xu Muan eyes, this man was slippery, cunning, and hypocritical. He was really not a good person, but he was used to pleasing people and had a very good relationship with Xiao Jingting.\u201cNo, but father said he would consider it.\u201d Xiao Xiaodong said.\u201cIn future take good care of your brother. Don\u2019t let your brother be alone with him and neither do you.\u201d Xu Muan ordered.Xiao Xiaodong nodded solemnly and said, \u201cMother -Father, I know.\u201dXu Muan pursed his lips and thought of Xiao Jingting\u2019s gambling debt. Even if Xiao Jingting didn\u2019t want to sell his children now, it would be hard to say what would happen when the people from the gambling shop came to ask for gambling debts.When Xiao Jingting got up, he found that the door next door was locked. Xiao Jingting called the two kids to eat, but there was no response.\u201cBrother, he\u2019s asking us for dinner.\u201d Xiao Xiaofan licked his lips.Xiao Xiaodong glared at Xiao Xiaofan and said, \u201cEat, eat, you only know how to eat, and you are not afraid that he will catch you and sell you.\u201dXiao Xiaofan bulged his cheek and said, \u201cDad is not that kind of person. Dad is very kind to me.\u201dXiao Xiaodong said angrily, \u201cA little favor can buy you off. You are really useless.\u201dXiao Xiaofan climbed to the wooden table in front of the window and secretly peeped through the window to see the movement outside.\u201cAh!\u201d Xiao Xiaofan exclaimed.\u201cWhat did you see?\u201d Xiao Xiaodong asked.\u201cA lot of grapes.\u201d The grapes had been bearing fruit before, but they were all green and small. Xiao Xiaofan picked two of them and ate them but they were very sour so he stayed away from grapes for several days.\u201cIt\u2019s just grapes. There were a lot of them before.\u201d Xiao Xiaodong didn\u2019t care.Xiao Xiaofan blinked his eyes and said, \u201cit used to be green before and now they are purple.\u201dXiao Xiaodong rolled his eyes and said, \u201cEven if it becomes purple, it is still sour.\u201dVisit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Xiao Xiaofan blinked and said, \u201cBut it looks delicious now.\u201dXiao JingtingXiao Jingting spawned the grapes and went out.Xiao Xiaodong watched Xiao Jingting leave and became relieved.Xiao Xiaodong was distracted and sat by the bedside. Xiao Xiaofan was scratching the window and only staring at the grapes outside drooling.Xiao Xiaofan slipped out to pick a bunch of grapes while Xiao Xiaodong wasn\u2019t paying attention.Xiao Xiaodong looked at the grapes Xiao Xiaofan picked, and his face becomes livid. \u201cWhy are you picking his grapes?\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. Dad is not here, and there are so many grapes. He won\u2019t find out.\u201d Xiao Xiaofan doesn\u2019t care.Xiao Xiaodong said hopefully, \u201cHe may find out when he came back.\u201d\u201cDad loves me the most. He won\u2019t hit me.\u201d Xiao Xiaofan said.Xiao Xiaodong said hatefully, \u201cYou only remember when he give you stuff to eat but not when he hit things, or how he beat you in the past, forget it.\u201d In most serious ones, Xiao Xiaofan was almost was killed by Xiao Jingting.Xiao Xiaofan flattened his mouth and burst into tears.Xiao Xiaodong saw Xiao Xiaofan crying pitifully, and comforted Xiao Xiaofan in a soft voice.When Xu Muan came back in the evening, he found that the food he left for Xiao Xiaofan and Xiao Xiaodong was not touched. There were grape skins on the ground of the room and two clusters of grapes on the table.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

As soon as Xiao Jingting came back, he found that there were nearly 20 clusters of grapes missing.As soon as Xiao Jingting looked at the grapevines in the courtyard, he knew that it must have been Xiao Xiaofan who stole the grapes.In fact, the lack of a dozen or twenty clusters of grapes in the courtyard was inconspicuous when there were hundreds in the yard, it was just that the grape picker was too arrogant and keep picking grapes from one place till it was picked clean, so it was hard not to be found out.Xiao Jingting looked at the empty grapevines and shook his head. The grapes there were the most prosperous, but now they were all bare.Xiao Xiaofan 'stealthily\u201d observed the movements of Xiao Jingting, turned his head and looked at Xiao Xiaodong anxiously, \u201cDad seems to have found out, will he come to hit me?\u201d\u201cWho makes you so stupid to focus on one place where you picked grapes?\u201d Xiao Xiaodong didn\u2019t have a good temper.Xiao Xiaofan tugged at his sleeve, a little aggrieved, \u201cThat place has the biggest grapes, ah!\u201dXiao Xiaodong glared at Xiao Xiaofan angrily and scolded, \u201cYou silly boy.\u201dAlthough Xiao Xiaofan was stupid, he was very enthusiastic. When he found that the grapes were delicious he called Xiao Xiaodong to eat them together. Xiao Xiaodong also thought that they were delicious and Xiao Xiaofan volunteered to pick two more strings.Xiao Xiaodong felt that he had already picked all the grapes anyway, and it was all right to pick two more strings. How could he know that he would be addicted to eating and picked more than a dozen strings at once, from the same place he picked before?\u00a0 By the time Xiao Xiaodong found out, the grapes had all been picked up and the vines there were still in a mess.When the grapes were picked, they couldn\u2019t be glued back, so Xiao Xiaodong and Xiao Xiaofan shared the grapes with each other.\u201cSorry! The little child was ignorant and stole your grapes.\u201d Xu Muan walked to the courtyard and was fsincerely apologized to Xiao Jingting.Xiao Jingting didn\u2019t care, \u201cIt\u2019s all right. They\u2019re my sons, and I won\u2019t blame them no matter how many grapes they ate.\u201dXiao Xiaofan and Xiao Xiaodong had been behaving themselves well. The children on the earth were becoming more arrogant nowadays and spoiled rotten at home. They would always get what they wanted.When Xu Muan heard Xiao Jingting words, he could not help but feel a little guilty about his previous vigilance against Xiao Jingting. It seemed that Xiao Jingting had really changed.Xiao Jingting picked a bunch of grapes for Xu Muan and said, \u201cHave a taste\u201d The plants in this world were growing fast, he had cast the growing Technique again in the morning and the grapes were ripe, he had originally thought that it would still take a long time.Xu Muan tasted one and said, \u201cIt tastes good, and it seems to improve the spiritual power.\u201d Xiao Xiaofan left two clusters of grapes for Xu Muan. In fact, Xu Muan had already tasted them in advance.\u201cHow much do you think this grape can sell for?\u201d Xiao Jingting asked.\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be a problem to sell two or three hundred copper coins. If you sell more, the price should be lower.\u201d There are nearly 400 clusters of grapes in the yard which, according to conservative estimates, should sell for 100 silver.Xiao Jingting nodded, two to three hundred coppers was quite a lot.\u201cYou want to sell grapes? What would you do after you sell the grapes?\u201d Xu Muan asked.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Xiao Jingting laughed awkwardly and said, \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have pawned out my family fields in the past. However, I can get the fields back by paying back some interest. Then I guess I will buy back those few mu of upper-grade fields first.\u201dOnly the top grade fields could grow high-grade spirit plants, usually those who had top-grade fields at home planted them carefully. Who would be like the original body owner that would pawn it?\u201cI think if we have money, it would be better to pay off the gambling debt first.\u201d Xu Muan suggested, if they pissed off the gambling house, they would be in big trouble.\u201cI don\u2019t have any gambling debts.\u201d Xiao Jingting said.Xu Muan was stunned for a moment before he said, \u201cNo gambling debts? Then when you met Qiu Bai before\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a lie, I\u2019m no one to him, what does it have to do with me if his oldest brother wants a wife? However, it wouldn\u2019t be good to refuse him directly so I used this as an excuse.\u201d Xiao Jingting said lightly.Xu Muan looks at Xiao Jingting and only to felt that Xiao Jingting was not Xiao Jingting anymore.Xiao Jingting turned his head, looked at Xu Muan and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201dXu Muan smiled and said, \u201cNothing.\u201d\u201cBy the way, I\u2019m going to town tomorrow to sell grapes, do you want to come with me?\u201d Xiao Jingting asked.Xu Muan nodded and said, \u201cYes!\u201d Xu Muan secretly thought: Xiao Jingting\u2019s grapes should make a lot of money when they are sold but selling the child can only get thirty silver, Xiao Jingting can make good money like this, so he shouldn\u2019t be interested in earning money from selling the children.\u201cBy the way, that Wang Erhu who came before\u2026\u201dXu Muan heard Xiao Jingting mention this person and couldn\u2019t help being on guard, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cI think this man seems to have an ulterior motive for me. I used to gamble a lot and sold the land by his instigation. I think he may be asked to frame me up. If he comes to make trouble tomorrow, you better help me take care of him.Xu Muan nodded and said, \u201cI got it.\u201d It was this Wang Erhu who had urged Xiao Jingting to sell his children.

Knowing that Xiao Xiaofan and Xiao Xiaodong were planning to help too, Xiao Jingting agreed after thinking about it.Xiao Jingting held Xiao Xiaofan\u2019s hand and looked at his face that was a bit sad.Xiao Xiaofan looked at Xiao Jingting\u2019s face, blinking his big dark eyes and said, \u201cDaddy, what\u2019s going on! You are not happy!\u201dXiao Jingting smiled and said, \u201cDaddy is worried that the grapes will not be sold.\u201d\u201cThe grapes are delicious. I\u2019m sure they can be sold.\u201d Xiao Xiaofan raised his fist to cheer Xiao Jingting up.\u201cReally? Are the grapes delicious?\u201d Xiao Jingting asked with a light smile.Xiao Xiaofan nodded solemnly and said, \u201cYes, the grapes are delicious, and Xiaofan loves to eat them.\u201d\u201cIf only everyone thinks the same.\u201d Xiao Xiaodong glared at Xiao Xiaofan.Xiao Xiaofan looked at Xiaodong and said, \u201cBrother, you love to eat it too! You ate more grapes than I did, and Daddy also likes to eat them. The two bunches of grapes I left for daddy were eaten up.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d Xiao Jingting looked at Xu Muan with a smile on his face and Xu Muan\u2019s face imminently turned red.Xiao Jingting shook his head in his heart, Xu Muan was only a teenager, at this age in his previous life he would still be in high school, but he already had two kids.When the four of them reached the village entrance, an ox cart was already waiting. Li Sheng sitting at the head of the cart was smoking and smiled with surprise when he saw them.\u201cLittle Xu! Going to the city again! \u201d Li Sheng asked genially.Xu Muan nodded and said, \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThis time you are going with the head of the family and the children!\u201d Li Sheng looked at Xiao Jingting and smiled.Xu Muan was a little embarrassed by Li Sheng as he said, \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cMaster Xiao, I heard that you\u2019ve recently lost your way, that\u2019s right, get down to farming and raising your family, with your skills, the days will become better and better.\u201d Li Sheng said.Xiao Jingting nodded and agreed, \u201cYou made a point.\u201d\u201cWhat are you going to do in the city?\u201d Li Sheng asked.\u201cTo sell something.\u201d Xiao Jingting said vaguely.Li Sheng nodded and said, \u201c Well! Get in the cart.\u201dThere were already several people sitting in the cart, when they saw Xiao Jingting and Xu Muan coming in, several people in the cart looked up curiously.Xiao Jingting was notorious and everyone in Mound Village knew that Xiao Jingting and Xu Muan had a bad relationship, Now watching the two people come in, the people in the cart stared curiously at Xiao Jiangting. Xiao Jingting, who was treated as if he was a rarely-seen treasure, felt very embarrassed.Xiao Jingting felt that one person in the cart looked at them with different expressions, Xiao Jingting searched and found that this person was Qiu Li, Qiu Bai\u2019s brother.\u201cBrother Xiao, what will you do in the city this time?\u201d Qiu Li asked.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201cSell something and subsidize the family.\u201d Xiao Jingting said faintly.Qiu Li glanced at Xiao Jingting basket and said, \u201cI am afraid that brother Xiao is mistaken. There are not many people in the city who liked to eat grapes, so you can\u2019t sell them at a good price. I am just afraid that you will have to pay for a trip back and forth in vain.\u201dXiao Jingting smiled disapproving and said, \u201cIt\u2019s all right. I\u2019m just trying.\u201dSeeing that Xiao Jingting was not taking his words seriously, Qiu Li snorted and did not speak anymore.Xiao Jingting held Xiao Xiaofan in his arms and did not pay any attention to this man.Xiao Xiaofan was yawning lazily in Xiao Jingting\u2019s arms and Xiao Jingting spoiled him, rubbing Xiao Xiaofan head.Xiao Xiaodong was full of envy when he looked at Xiao Xiaofan in Xiao Jingting\u2019s arms. Looking at Xiao Jingting\u2019s eyes, he quickly turned away his face.As soon as people come inside, the ox cart started to run fast. Xiao Jingting felt the power of the exotic ox cart for the first time. It turned out that the ox could run so fast and so steadily.Xiao Jingting thought to himself:\u00a0If he becomes rich, he will also buy an ox cart, so he doesn\u2019t have to walk so much to go to the fields every day. Now he has only five mu of land, and he was very free every day so it was okay to waste a little time on the road. But when he will get all the fields back, he will be much busier.\u201cHow much money is this ox-cart of Uncle Li worth?\u201d Xiao Jingting asked Xu Muan in a low voice.Xu Muan was shocked for a moment before he replied, \u201cIt is very difficult to domesticate demon beasts. Many demon beasts will devour their masters when they grow. Uncle Li raised this demonic beast since childhood and it has a close relationship with his family. If ordinary people wanted to buy demonic beast, they have to go to the gate of the Imperial Beast Hall to buy them. The demon beasts there are all controlled by the Imperial Beast Talisman and the price of taming beasts is very high. If Uncle Li bought this ox from the Imperial Beast Hall, the price would be no less than eight hundred silver. \u201dMany people were reluctant to pay the training fees of the Imperial Beast Hall. Therefore, many people would buy docile beast cubs to raise. Raising them from young age will be easier to bond with them and it generally will not make big problems.Xiao Jingting nodded and said, \u201cIt\u2019s really expensive!\u201d He really felt like a poor man now.Qiu Li, who had been resting with his eyes closed, heard Xiao Jingting words, opened his eyes, and glanced at him with sarcasm.Xiao Jingting felt furious about the disdained look of Qiu Li and his stomach and liver ached with anger.Qiu Li was a typical son of bitch and hypocrite. Xiao Jingting was sure that everything happened between Qiu Bai and the original body ownerdefinitely had something to do with Qiu Li, who must have plotted behind the scenes! The Qiu family preferred men to women, and Qiu Li\u2019s position in the Qiu family was much higher than that of Qiu Bai.Qiu Bai and Qiu Li ware of the same mind. They wanted the silver of the original body owner butdispised him and took advantage of him. They also thought that the original body owner shouldn\u2019t covet something way out of his league.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Xiao Jingting and Xu Muan rented a stall in the market in the city.People came and went in the market, but Xiao Jingting and Xu Muan were a little shy, Xiao Xiaofan thought it was time for him to show his skills and shouted at the top of his voice, \u201cGrapes, fresh grapes!\u201dXiao Xiaofan was so brave that Xiao Jingting who was self-conscious immediately got impressed by Xiao Xiaofan differently.Seeing Xiao Jingting\u2019s appreciation of Xiao Xiaofan, Xiao Xiaodong was envious and anxious, but he couldn\u2019t shout out like Xiao Xiaofan. He was angry with himself in his heart, so he pulled a long face, which Xiao Jingting thought funny.Xiao Xiaofan looked lovely so several women came to ask about the price. When they heard that a cluster of grapes cost 250 coppers, they immediately scattered.Xiao Jingting was not annoyed, and cut open a few grapes, inviting people to taste them, which finally helped them promote the sales.However, the impression that the grapes were not delicious was deeply rooted in people\u2019s minds. The price was also high, so Xiao Jingting sold only 30 strings of grapes for the whole morning. Xiao Jingting was unwilling to reduce the price. But people who were willing to accept this price wouldn\u2019t hang out in this low-grade market, so the situation was somewhat in a stalemate.Looking at the depressed Xiao Jingting, Xu Muan said, \u201cI have a suggestion.\u201dXiao Jingting nodded his head and said, \u201cJust say it.\u201d\u201cI have some friendship with Zhou Ji, the owner of the Yuehe Restaurant. When he opens a restaurant, he needs to prepare a lot of spiritual fruit every day so we can sell grapes to him. He should be able to sell a lot. However, I\u2019m afraid the price will need to be lower.\u201d Xu Muan said carefully.In the past, Xiao Jingting was headstrong and never listened to Xu Muan and would often scold Xu Muan for meddling in his business and sometimes even beat him. Over time, Xu Muan seldom expressed his opinions.Xiao Jingting nodded and his eyes lit up as he said lightly, \u201cIf he can buy most of the grapes, then the price can be lower.\u201d The grapes would go bad after they had been kept for too long and many of them would not be sold if they continued like this.Hearing Xiao Jingting agree with him, Xu Muan couldn\u2019t help but feel a little happy.Xiao Jingting cleaned up for a while, and Xu Muan found the owner of the restaurant and sold 300 clusters of grapes to Zhou Ji, the owner of Yuehe restaurant for 200 copper coins per cluster. With the money from more than 30 clusters of grapes sold before, Xiao Jingting had more than sixty silver in his hand.\u201cHurry up and redeem those mu of fine land.\u201d Xu Muan urged.Xiao Jingting smiled awkwardly and said, \u201cWhen I went out, one mu of high-grade land was 22 silver. To redeem it, I needed 26. The money I have now can only redeem two mu.\u201dXu Muan thought about it and said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you redeem those mu of medium farmland first?\u201d Although the first-class field was good, they don\u2019t have enough spiritual power to make full use of this resource. With Xiao Jingting\u2019s current strength, it would be already difficult with the medium fields.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Xiao Jingting nodded and agreed, \u201cOK!\u201dThe total amount of medium field was six mu, ten silver per mu of field. Plus three percent of interest,\u00a0 it would take a total of 78 silver to redeem it.Xiao Jingting took the title deed and shook his head in depression. He lost all the money he had just earned and still needed to add some.Xu Muan family also cultivated land before he married Xiao Jingting, so he had a special affection for the land, seeing Xiao Jingting redeem the land, he immediately felt reassured.Looking at Xiao Jingting\u2019s expression, Xu Muan confronted him, saying, \u201cOutside one mu of medium field will be sold for about eighteen silver. Although some interest has been added, it is still cost-effective. With there fields in your hand, you can rent them out and have some income every year.\u201cThe owner of the pawnshop thought that Xiao Jingting wouldn\u2019t come to redeem the land, so he lowered the price of the field to ten silver, just now when Xiao Jingting went to redeem the land the face of the owner of the pawnshop was as bad as it could be.Xu Muan slightly raised the corner of his mouth as he thought to himself: The pawnshop owner never thought that Xiao Jingting would come to redeem the land deed. He used to think that Xiao Jingting would never come back.\u201cI know.\u201d Xiao Jingting smiled helplessly, but he was still distressed by so much silver! \u201cCome and pick some seeds with me.\u201dXu Muan nodded and said cheerfully, \u201cGood! If you want to buy seeds for medium-level fields you should buy seeds of better quality. \u201dXiao Jingting did not know that shortly after he left the pawnshop Wang Erhu would walk into the pawnshop.The pawnshop owner was full of dissatisfaction as he said, \u201cYou said that Xiao Jingting would not come to redeem the land, but as a result, he redeemed all six mu of land. If I had known it, I would have given him more money to earn more money from interest.\u201dWang Erhu chuckled and said, \u201cHe was introduced by me in the first place, shopkeeper, you earned more than ten silver from nothing, so don\u2019t complain. Just I don\u2019t know where he got the money. He told me before that he spent it all. \u201dThinking about that nobleman\u2019s words, that as long as Xiao Jingting was seperated from his wife and children, and had to live on the street, he would give him 500 silver, Wang Wrhu could not help becoming anxious. Originally, Xiao Jingting was addicted to the Happy Powder and gambling, and he was about to be broke, but now, he didn\u2019t gamble or spend money on whores, and he had changed his ways of living. It was just too unbelievable.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Our shop has newly introduced Fire Cloud Rice and Green Fire Vegetables, all of which are suitable for Fire practitioners to eat, so the guest can buy some.\u201dXiao Jingting raised his eyebrows with interest. Xu Muan grabbed Xiao Jingting, shook his head, and said, \u201cDon\u2019t buy it.\u201dXiao Jingting looked at Xu Muan in bewilderment and asked, \u201cWhat is the matter?\u201d\u201cFire Cloud Rice is third-level spiritual plant, but if it is sold, the price is 20% lower than that of spiritual rice with wood attribute. However, the planting difficulty is not lower than that of the spiritual rice with wood attribute.\u201d Xu Muan explained.\u201cIt\u2019s alright. If we plant it, we can eat by ourselves, we will not sell it.\u201dXiao Jingting did not care.\u201cBoss, I want a bag of seeds of Fire Cloud Rice and Green Fire Vegetables.\u201d Xiao Jingting said.Xu Muan said uneasily, \u201cThere is no need to plant so many.\u201d Fire practitioners can accept wood spirit rice, but wood practitioners have difficulty in eating Fire Cloud Rice, which was one of the reasons why fire spirit rice was stagnating.Xiao Jingting shook his head lightly and said, \u201cIt\u2019s all right. What kind is it?\u201dXiao Jingting picked out another bag of sweet potato seeds and a bag of common spirit rice seeds and was ready\u00a0 to go home. One bag of seeds was just enough for one mu of land, and the remaining one mu of medium level field, which Xiao Jingting planned to use for planting grapes.Four bags of seeds cost another six silver and after spending this money, Xiao Jingting wouldn\u2019t have much money left.\u201cSir, you really love your wife!\u201d The shopkeeper was just saying it casually but did not think that Xiao Jingting really wanted those seeds, so he immediately joked along.Xiao Jingting smiled and didn\u2019t speak, but Xu Muan\u2019s face turned red.Xiao Jingting left the seed store with Xu Muan and walked out of the city.\u201cIf you don\u2019t have any silver, I still have some.\u201d Xu Muan weighed it for a long time before he said it.Xiao Jingting glanced at Xu Muan and said, \u201cNo, the spirit plants in the five mu field at home can be harvested. If they are sold, we can also have more than 20 silver of input. When we go back, they should be harvested quickly.\u201d Xiao Jingting said.Xu Muan nodded and responded, \u201cWell, I\u2019ll help you.\u201d\u201cI think we still need to buy an earthworm.\u201d Before, they had a little land, so he could borrow earthworm from the Village head. But now when he redeemed all that land, there would be more chances to use that earthworm and it was not an option to always rent it from village head. As a matter of fact, Xiao Jingting still wanted a monster for traveling, but at present, he was lack of money, so he could only think about it.Xiao Jingting thought secretly: when the second batch of grapes are planted, it should be more abundant. The owner of the restaurant said that when the second batch of grapes would be ready, he could still buy them from him at the same price as before.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Xu Muan nodded, answered, and said, \u201cMm-hmm.\u201d A good-looking second-class earthworm cost three or four silver and Xu Muan couldn\u2019t help but feel a physical pain.Xu Muan and Xiao Jingting walked up to the ox cart and after a while Qiu Li also came. Unlike how arrogant and pampous he was when he came, Qiu Li looked at the two of them with a strange expression.Xiao Jingting didn\u2019t want to pay attention to this person and closed his eyes on his own, and Xu Muan soon followed suit.Xu Muan walked back to the house and looked at the dozens of grapes left in the courtyard, as if he had seen tons of silver.\u201cIf these grapes were to be sold\u2026\u201d\u201cThese grapes are not for sale.\u201d Xiao Jingting interrupted Xu Muan, \u201cWe have to save something good for ourselves. This grape can enhance our strength. You and I can eat a few strings every day, and they will be eaten up in a few days. But we can no longer give them to the children. Fortunately, the spiritual energy in grapes is relatively mild. Otherwise, the two kids would have some problems after eating so much.\u201dXu Muan nodded solemnly when he heard this speech and said, \u201cI will pay attention to it.\u201d The two children \u00a0were still too young, and absorbing too much spiritual power would damage their meridians, so he cannot be careless.In the evening, Xu Muan stayed in the room, nibbling grapes one by one, his eyes full of excitement.Xiao Xiaofan grabbed Xu Muan\u2019s pants and drooled. \u201cDaddy, give me one grape, just one grape.\u201dXu Muan ignored Xiao Xiaofan\u2019s pleas and checked Xiao Xiaofan meridians that were\u00a0 blocked by vitality. These days, Xiao Xiaofan not only should not eat grapes, but even the amount of his food should be halved.\u201cGo to bed.\u201d Xu Muan urged.Xiao Xiaofan climbed into bed dejectedly and said to himself, \u201cFather has become generous, but Daddy become stingy.\u201d.Xiao Xiaodong looked at Xu Muan\u2019s excited appearance and felt a little happy. In his impression, Xu Muan had not been so happy for a long time. Xiao Xiaodong remembered that his grandfather said that his Daddy was greedy when they were little and always ate their family food.Thinking of Xiao Jingting next door, Xiao Xiaodong couldn\u2019t help thinking that it would be great if his father would continue like this.After eating the grapes, Xu Muan licked his lips and thought of helping Xiao Jingting harvest spiritual plants tomorrow, so Xu Muan climbed into bed early.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It is more than 60 taels of silver.\u201d Qiu Bai couldn\u2019t help asking.Qiu Li shook his head and said, \u201cHow could I be mistaken? Xiao Jingting sold dozens of clusters of grapes in the market and made several taels of silver. Later, he sold all the grapes to the shopkeeper of Yuehe restaurant for 200 copper coins for string and earned more than 60 silver.\u201d He spent some money bribing the waiter of Yuehe restaurant to find out this news.He didn\u2019t expect that grapes could be sold for money. Qiu Li felt ashamed and flustered when he thought of what he had said to Xiao Jingting before.Qiu Bai widened his eyes and said, puzzled, \u201cWhat kind of grapes are so valuable?\u201d The wild grapes on the back of the mountain are all uneaten.Qiu Li shook his head and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know. You should go and ask Xiao Jingting .\u201dQiu Bai said awkwardly, \u201cXiao Jingting has been acting strange recently. He doesn\u2019t pay much attention to me.\u201d\u201cMaybe you have been playing cool all the time and he thought he will not have any chance to live with you. He thought he won\u2019t be able to take any advantage so he becomes lukewarm to you.\u201d Qiu Li said.Qiu Bai snorted and said, \u201cBrother, what are you talking about, do you want me to sleep with that bastard Xiao Jingting for some little favor? He doesn\u2019t deserve it. \u201d All the people in the village thought that he was the most outstanding and that he would certainly be able to marry into a large family in the future. Xiao Jingting might as well be a young Master from Xiao family, but now he was not better than a poor man who had been just sent here.Qiu Li frowned and said, \u201cToday is different from the past. Xiao Jingting is nothing now. However, if he has such a good grape-growing skill, he will be able to make a fortune sooner or later. Besides, the Xiao family house is one of the kind in this village.Qiu Bai couldn\u2019t help but feel a little moved by what he heard, but on second thought, he didn\u2019t feel right about it. \u201cBrother, it\u2019s not like you don\u2019t know Xiao Jingting. He can\u2019t help spending a lot of money on eating, drinking, whoring and gambling. He can\u2019t help spending a lot of money. \u00a0He seems to be getting better recently, but who knows how long he can hold on?\u201dQiu Li nodded and said, \u201cThere is some truth in your worries, let\u2019s wait and see.\u201dQiu Bai continued: \u201cIf the grapes from Xiao Jingting can be sold for money, the news will come out sooner or later. When more people start planting them, those grapes will naturally become worthless.\u201dQiu Li nodded and said, \u201cThat\u2019s right, you go and see how Xiao Jingting grapes are grown, if you can make it as well, we will follow suit. \u201dQiu Bai eyes brightened as he said to himself: Yes! If grapes are so good for making money, there\u2019s no reason to sit around and watch others getting rich.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026The next day, Xiao Jingting and Xu Muan encountered Qiu Bai again on their way to the fields.Seeing Qiu Bai, Xu Muan couldn\u2019t help feeling anoyed.\u201cBrother Xiao, where are you going?\u201d Qiu Bai asked enthusiastically.Xiao Jingting said impatiently, \u201cRushing to the fields.\u201dVisit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201cBrother Xiao, you\u2019ve been getting more and more industrious lately!\u201d Qiu Bai complimented.\u201cThere\u2019s almost no food left to eat, so naturally I have to be more diligent.\u201d Xiao Jingting faintly said.Qiu Bai laughed and said, \u201cBrother Xiao, stop joking around, didn\u2019t you just sell grapes and make a good amount of money?\u201dXiao Jingting\u2019s heart sank. The matter of him selling grapes had reached Qiu Bai ears so quickly. Thinking of Qiu Li who had gone to the city with him yesterday, Xiao Jingting suddenly understood something: Qiu Bai knew about it, probably because Qiu Li had told him about it. \u201cThat money has all been spent.\u201dQiu Bai frowned and said, \u201cSo much money, how could it be all spent up?\u201d\u201cI spent it all. It is all gone.\u201d\u00a0He didn\u2019t want to either! But,he had so many things to pay for.Qiu Bai\u2019s face become tense as he smiled awkwardly, and responded with, \u201coh.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Xiao Jingting said to Xu Muan.Xu Muan nodded and said, \u201cAll right!\u201dXiao Jingting and Xu Muan went to fields and got busy.Xiao Jingting found that the original owner still had some advantages, for example, this body of the original owner was so much better than the one he originally had. He used to have backache when he worked, but now he seemed to have endless strength.Leaving a few bags of spirit rice for himself to eat, Xiao Jingting planned to sell the rest of the spirit rice. Xiao Jingting didn\u2019t like to go to town, and Xu Muan was afraid that when Xiao Jingting would go to the town and become attracted to the colorful world and reverted to his old ways, and volunteered to take on the task of selling food.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 22: 22When Xiao Jingting and Xu Muan returned to their house, they found that several strings of grapes were missing again. Xu Muan thought that his two sons had stolen them to eat again, so he was immediately filled with anger.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t my brother and me who stole the food, it was someone who broke in and picked the grapes. We even tried to stop him, my brother bit him and I hit him too.\u201d Xiao Xiaodong said.\u201cWho was it?\u201d Xiao Jingting asked.\u201cAn\u00a0androgynous person, wearing a pink dress with flowers on it.\u201d Xiao Xiaofan pursed his lips full of grievances.As soon as Xiao Jingting heard it, he knew that it was Qiu Bai. \u201cThis person is so shameless!\u201dBut it was also the original body owner\u2019s fault. There was no smoke without fire. \u00a0The original body owner shouldn\u2019t have messed with such a person.Xu Muan took a deep breath, they settled down in this village years ago and they were readily ostracized in the village. But now if they had to find someone to defend them in the village for a few strings of grapes, the villagers would not help them, so he had to calm down and let it go.Xiao Jingting closed his eyes and breathed out a sigh of helplessness, saying, \u201cIt looks like it\u2019s time to raise two spirit dogs.\u201dXu Muan sighed lightly and said, \u201cSpirit dogs aren\u2019t cheap!\u201d Now even more money was needed and buying spiritual dog would only slow them down.Xiao Jingting thought about it for a moment and said, \u201cThis can\u2019t be made known to all, but we shouldn\u2019t keep it to ourselves eithert. If people come to pick our grapes up, we don\u2019t know how much loss we will suffer if they make it their habbit. Go and tell the village head that we had burglars in our house, but that there is not many valuble things missing. We will no investigate, however, he should remind the villagers to be careful of the thieves.\u201dXu Mu nodded and said, \u201cI know.\u201d In fact, Xu Muan was actually a little surprised, in Xu Muan opinion, Xiao Jingting and Qiu Bai had an affair. But unexpectedly, Xiao Jingting turned his back to Qiu Bai.Xu Muan looked at the sparse grapes and felt a flesh of pain, originally there were only a few strings of grapes left but Qiu Bai still came to steal them.Qiu family.\u201cThis grape are actually sweet, and it contains rich aura.\u201d Qiu Li exclaimed. He originally thought that people in the city had too much money to spend, and only after eating these grapes he realized that he was wrong. The grapes planted by Xiao Jingting were really different.Qiu Bai said indifferently, \u201cXiao Jingting is a third level Qi Practitioner after all, it is not surprising that the grapes grown by him are full of aura.\u201d Thinking that Xiao Jingting become a Level 3 Qi Practitioner at a young age and might become Level 4 Qi Practitioner soon, Qiu Bai suddenly felt that Xiao Jingting may not be not a good match.Qiu Bai brought back six strings of grapes, and only half of a string was given to him. When his parents found out that these grapes could improve strength, they gave Qiu Li all five clusters of grapes, hoping that Qiu Li could advance to level 3 Qi Practitioner after eating the grapes. Qiu Bai was a little angry in his heart but there was nothing he could do about it.Qiu Li ate the grapes and thought about Qiu Bai\u2019s words, but he was jealous and he secretly thought: as a young master of a big family, no matter how lazy and unmotivated he is, a massive amount of resources are given to him, so he will be much stronger for sure. However, I diligently cultivate all day long and am only on the second level of Qi. This world is really unfair.\u201cDidn\u2019t you said that there is still plenty of grapes there? Why don\u2019t you go pick some more?\u201d Qiu Li asked.Qiu Bai blushed immediately. It was already eye-catching enough for him to pick such a few strings. How could he pick up all the grapes from others? Besides, the two little kids kept yelling at him and cursing so loudly. Qiu Bai was annoyed that his elder brother would only eat and send him to do all the work.Relishing the taste of the grapes, Qiu Bai couldn\u2019t help thinking about them. He wanted to go to Xiao Jingting\u2019s house to pick a few more strings of grapes. Anyway, there were still many in Xiao family.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Qiu Bai planned to do so tomorrow. When Qiu father returned home, he gave Qiu Bai a good scolding.After listening to Qiu father\u2019s words, Qiu Bai face suddenly turned white. Qiu Bai didn\u2019t expect that Xu Muan would directly describe him as a thief. If he bears the name of a thief, how could he marry into a good family in the future!\u201cThe good news is that this isn\u2019t a big deal, so don\u2019t go to the Xiao family in the future.\u201d Qiu father said.Qiu Bai felt wronged. It was his brother who asked him to steal the grapes, but his father only scolded him when something went wrong.\u201cDid Xu Muan talk to the village head?\u201d Qiu Bai asked.Qiu Bai\u2019s father nodded and said, \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cHe was jealous of me and deliberately made things difficult for me. Xiao Jingting must have been kept in the dark by him.\u201d Qiu Bai said.Qiu Bai\u2019s father said angrily, \u201cWithout Xiao Jingting\u2019s permission, how would Xu Muan dare to do this? You also said that Xiao Jingting would be manipulated by you but now I don\u2019t think he takes you seriously.\u201dQiu Bai flushed with shame when he heard what his father said.Because of Qiu Bai, Xiao Jingting picked up all the grapes of the yard and left only a few strings to eat. The rest was squeezed into grape juice and eaten up together with Xu Muan. Then Xiao Jingting found that Xu Muan had a good appetite.Maybe it was because Xu Muan hadn\u2019t had any juice before, Xu Muan\u2019s eyes were full of wonder.\u201cYou have a good appetite!\u201d Xiao Jingting joked.When Xu Muan heard this, he blushed a little, and his face was almost buried in the bowl containing grape juice.Xiao Jingting looked at Xu Muan\u2019s embarrassed face and only felt that Xu Muan was lovely and cute.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They stared at them and looked very pitifully. Xiao Jingting let them take a sip of grapes juice to relish the flavor but he didn\u2019t expect it made the two kids crave for more.Xu Muan couldn\u2019t stand their greedy look and drove them to sleep.Xiao Xiaofan sat on the bed and rubbed his feet, full of exasperation, \u201cDaddy and father are getting more and more stingy.\u201dXiao Xiaofan was very aggrieved. In the past, his father hid the delicious food and ate it himself. Now, his Daddy also eats delicious food with father, butthey were driven to bed.Xiao Xiaodong looked at Xiao Xiaofan and hummed, \u201cIt\u2019s a pity that we don\u2019t have much strength. That\u2019s why we can only eat less, and if we eat more, we will only get sick. When I grow up, my strength will also rise and I will be able to eat a lot more. Poor thing, I\u2019ve been teaching you for so long, but you still haven\u2019t even gotten any progress yet, so you can only continue to eat little.\u201dXiao Xiaofan was full of surprise and looked at Xiao Xiaodong, pouting, and it looked like he was about to cry.Xiao Xiaodong said coldly, \u201cIt\u2019s useless for you to look at me like that.\u201dXiao Xiaofan was unable to practice, which was the biggest concern of Xu Muan.Xiao Xiaodong would also urge Xiao Xiaofan to work harder when he was free. He would teach Xiao Xiaofan step by step,but Xiao Xiaofan still had been unable to get started.Xiao Xiaofan blinked his eyes and looked at Xiao Xiaodong with a pale face, but Xiao Xiaodong was not moved.Xiao Xiaofan pouted, crossed his legs, and started cultivating according to Xiao Xiaodong\u2019s method.After a few moments, Xiao Xiaodong was somewhat surprised to discover that he actually sensed Qi from Xiao Xiaofan body.Xiao Xiaodong looked at Xiao Xiaofan and stared at him with eyes full of amazement, before, he had spent so much effort, but Xiao Xiaofan still didn\u2019t make any progress. But now he could feel the Qin in his body. It turned out that when it came to food, this boy could make some advance.In fact, Xiao Xiaofan got enlightened not all because of the food. Xiao Xiaofan recently ate a lot of good food and his body was full of spiritual energy. Now when Xiao Xiaodong\u2019s words provoked him just now, he naturally felt the Qi.Xu Muan touched his stomach when he was full and thought to himself, The qi I absorbed after eating a meal like that is equivalent to what I had absorbed for dozens of days.\u201cDaddy, father, brother become enlightened.\u201d Xiao Xiaodong tugged on Xu Muan hand.Xu Muan\u2019s eyes brightened as he glanced at Xiao Xiaodong\u2019s body.\u201cDaddy, did you see that?\u201d\u201cYes, I saw it.\u201d Xu Muan looked at Xiao Xiaofan, only to feel that good things were coming one after another recently, if, it could go on like this forever, then he would be forever on cloud nine.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201cUncle Li, I\u2019ll trouble you again.\u201d Xu Muan said to Li Sheng.Li Sheng shook his head and said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, my pleasure, I\u2019m making a living for this.\u201dBecause there was a bit too much stuff, Xu Muan directly rented Li Sheng ox cart for a whole day this time.\u201cAre you going to sell the newly harvested grain?\u201d Li Sheng asked.Xu Muan nodded and said, \u201cYes!\u201d\u201cWhere is your husband? Why didn\u2019t he come with you?\u201d Li Sheng asked.\u201cHe went to the farm.\u201d Xu Muan said.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Li Sheng was filled with gratification, \u201cYour husband now entrusts you with the matters of selling grain. It is evident that he trusts you.\u201dXu Muan smiled faintly.Li Sheng looked at Xu Muan\u2019s smile, nodded and said, \u201cThat is right, families are supposed to support each other.\u201dLi Sheng grabbed a handful of grain and was filled with wonder, \u201cIt\u2019s indeed the spirit grain grown by a third level Qi Practitioner. The quality of this spirit grain is extraordinary.\u201dXu Muan smiled, he also felt that the grains grown by Xiao Jingting was of high quality and this batch wasn\u2019t even the best one, the best ones were left at home.Xiao Jingting said that the best should be left for his own family to eat, and Xu Muan felt that the quality of the grains planted by Xiao Jingting was so good and it did not look like it was planed on the low- grade field so he agreed to Xiao Jingting\u2019s idea of leaving the best grain at home for fear of causing unnecessary trouble.\u201cFrom what I hear, your husband has changed a lot lately.\u201d Li Sheng said.Xu Muan nodded and said, \u201cHe has changed a lot.\u201d\u201cGood for him. If he has the ability to grow crops, he won\u2019t need to worry about earning enough money, right?\u201dXu Muan bowed his head and could not help feeling a little uneasy. Xiao Jingting made too many mistakes in the past, but now Xiao Jingting was too good. It was common to have three wives and four concubines in this Wasteland.The first time they arrived in Mound Village, many people wanted to be a matchmaker for Xiao Jingting. Later, when those people saw that Xiao Jingting was acting badly, no one came to visit them anymore. If their life turned better in the future, those people would come back again.Xu Mu shook his head and drove out the bad ideas from his mind.Xu Muan sold the spirit crops and returned home. He handed over 22 taels of silver to Xiao Jingting, saying, \u201cCrops were sold for 26 taels of silver, I spent 4 taels of silver for earthworms, so here is 22 taels of silver left.\u201dXiao Jingting took the money and said, \u201cThank you for your hard work.\u201dXu Muan shook his head and said, \u201cIt\u2019s all right, it\u2019s not hard at all. By the way, when I went to the street, several people saw me and ordered grapes from me.\u201d\u201cOrdered grapes?\u201d Xiao Jingting asked.Xu Muan nodded and said, \u201cYes, many of the people who bought grapes yesterday still want to buy some more grapes. The grapes from Yuehe Restaurant are very expensive, and there are many people who bought grapes from us yesterday. Many people know that the grapes from Yuehe Restaurant are from us, so\u2026\u201dXiao Jingting thought for a moment and said, \u201cI see. If someone needs more, we can sign a long-term contract at a cheaper price.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 24: 24\u201cI heard something from the villagers.\u201d Xu Muan said to Xiao Jingting uneasily.\u201cWhat?\u201d Xiao Jingting asked.\u201cThose pieces of land we have are near the mountains. It\u2019s okay to plant ordinary spirit plants, but if we plant high-grade spirit plants, it will easily attract the demonic beast from the mountain. It was said that demonic beast often came down the mountains in the past, and the original owners of the fields were so annoyed by them that they had no choice but to sell these fields.\u201dXiao Jingting, \u201c\u2026.\u201d He wondered if the Xiao family gave these fields to the original body owner without knowing the situation or they did so on purpose. Considering the original body owner\u2019s temperament, even if he started planting crops on those fields, once the crops he planted were destroyed by demonic beast, he would then become furious and lose his heart again.\u201cWhen I harvested before, no demon beasts wreaked havoc.\u201d Xiao Jingting said.Xu Muan nodded and said, \u201cYes, but those five mu of fields were inferior, whichwere not very tempting to the demon beasts, so\u2026\u201d\u201cIt seems that we have to take precautions early\u2026\u201d Fields were hard to buy nowadays. Those few mu of medium level fields \u00a0were quite rare, so Xiao Jingting was really reluctant to give them up.Xu Muan nodded and said, \u201cWell, but higher level spirit plants are harder to grow, and it takes at least a month or so for this batch of spirit plants to grow up. Before the harvest, we don\u2019t have to worry too much.\u201d\u201cBefore those spirit plants are mature, we should make some traps in case the monsters really come, and we won\u2019t be caught unprepared.\u201d Xiao Jingting thought for a moment.Xu Muan nodded his head in approval.In the following days, Xu Muan helped Xiao Jingting plant the seeds, and the two of them spent three or four days to finish planting the fields.\u201cXiao Xu, are you busy?\u201dXu Muan looked at the visitor, \u201cMs. Li!\u201dMs. Li Cuiniang smiled at Xu Muan and said, \u201cMr. Xu, I heard that your husband has made a lot of progress lately and is busy planting crops everyday.\u201dXu Muan nodded and said, \u201cYes!\u201dAfter sowing the seeds, Xiao Jingting was busier than ever. The level of spiritual plants he planted in the past was lower and it didn\u2019t take him much trouble to take care of them. The spiritual plants in the medium level fields were different from the previous primary and secondary spirit plants. They needed to be looked after every day. There were also grapes in the yard. Since many people wanted to buy those grapes, Xiao Jingting had planted an extra mu of grapes. There were more kinds of spiritual plants in front of and behind their house.The spiritual energy needed to generate a third-grade spiritual plant was much more than that needed to generate a second-grade spiritual plant. Xiao Jingting returned every day after consuming almost all the spiritual energy in his body.Seeing that Xiao Jingting was busy and almost dizzy, Xu Muan couldn\u2019t help but feel guilty.Xiao Xiaodong was able to help with some chores, but Xiao Xiaodong\u2019s strength was too low, and his help was limited.Ms. Li said, \u201c Mr. Xu! I heard that your husband has sold that field. But he is planting crops in that field now, if someone comes to collect the land when it is due, you\u2019ll be working in vain!\u201dXiao Jingting attracted much attention since he came here.\u00a0As an old saying went,\u00a0although a rich family had become less rich than previous, they were still richer than a poor family. Xiao Jingting was sent here by the Xiao family, but whatever they gave him was enough for the village people to get an green- eye.After Xiao Jingting came to this place, he ate, drank, whored and gambled. Within a few days, he spent all the money his family gave him and sold out all the fields. Those who liked to gossip in the village immediately made Xiao Jingting\u2019s behavior known to all.Some people in the village even took Xiao Jingting as a bad example to warn their children that they should not learn from Xiao Jingting.\u201cThe fields have been bought back.\u201d Xu Muan said in a flat tone.\u201cHuh? Bought back?\u201d Aunt Li was startled.Xu Muan nodded and said, \u201cYes!\u201dVisit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201cIt looks like your husband is diligent and making progress now.\u201d Ms. Li said.\u201cYeah!\u201d Xu Muan laughed.In the field, Xiao Jingting took a sip of spiritual spring water and took a short break, preparing to go home.The medium-level field was different from the low-level field. In the past, when he took care of low-level field, the spiritual energy in his body was enough. However, after taking care of only two mu of medium-level fields, the spiritual energy in his body was almost consumed. Fortunately, he had spiritual spring water to replenish his spiritual energy in a short time.Xiao Jingting felt that when he drank the spiritual spring water after his spiritual energy had been completely consumed, the spiritual energy in his body would rise greatly. During this period, Xiao Jingting had been using this method to improve his strength.\u201cIt\u2019s time to eat.\u201d Xu Muan saw Xiao Jingting come back and greeted him.Now the cooking had been handed over to Xu Muan. Xu Muan was not very good at it, but it wouldn\u2019t take him much trouble to make some plain dishes.\u201cAre you inured?\u201d Xiao Jingting looked at the wound that had been bandaged on Xu Muan\u2019s arm and frowned.Xu Muan smiled and said, \u201cIt\u2019s just a minor injury, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d There was no one who would not get hurt when he was hunting in the mountain. He had been hurt more seriously several times before.\u201cDid you go to the mountain jungle again? I told you not to go there. \u201d Xiao Jingting said with some dissatisfaction.Xu Muan smiled faintly and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s all right. I did not go deep into the mountain.\u201dXiao Jingting shook his head and said, \u201cYou\u2019d better be careful. You are already injured.\u201d\u201cGot it, by the way, I went to the downtown today to sell prey, and I made a long-term contract for the supply of grapes with several big families. Here is locations of several families and the quantity of grapes they need.\u201d Xu Muan said.Xiao Jingting nodded and said, \u201cWell, that\u2019s good.\u201d\u201cHow long will it take for these grapes to ripen?\u201d Xu Muan asked excitedly.\u201cJust another ten days or so.\u201d Xiao Jingting said.Xu Muan lowered his head. His heart was filled with anticipation. When this batch of grapes was sold, their life would turn better.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 25": "Chapter 25Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 25: 25More than ten days passed in the blink of an eye.In a twinkling of an eye, the grapes matured and more than one mu of field was planted with grapes. At this time there were more than 1600 clusters of grapes. Xu Muan and Xiao Jingting picked up the first five hundred clusters of ripe grapes and sent them to the city.Because they had already made oral contracts with Yuehe Restaurant and several families in the city, the grapes were sold out quickly this time. Three hundred clusters were sold to the owner of Yuehe Restaurant at a price of two hundred copper coins for each cluster, and another two hundred clusters were sold to the big families at a price of 250 copper coins for each cluster.Five hundred clusters of grapes were sold a total of 112 taels of silver, Xiao Jingting, who had enough money now, gave 30 taels of silver to Xu Muan, who felt like he was dreaming while holding a large bag of silver. Xu Muan even walked lightly with this bag of silver.\u201cShall we go back now?\u201d Xu Muan asked.Xiao Jingting shook his head and said, \u201cNo, let\u2019s go to the weapon store and buy something to set traps.\u201dXu Muan nodded and said, \u201cGood!\u201d The crops in the medium-level fields were almost ripe, so they needed to prepare early.Xiao Jingting spent twelve taels of silver to buy a lot of iron clips and some sharp thorns.Xu Muan\u2019s eyes were attracted by a pair of sleeve arrows in the weapon shop. Xiao Jingting followed Xu Muan\u2019s gaze and looked at the sleeve arrows on the wall and said, \u201cDo you like it? Buy it if you like it.\u201d The sleeve arrows hanging on the wall were obviously not ordinary goods. Xu Muan liked to hunt in the jungle, but he did not have the proper weapons, which was not safe.\u201cSir, you really have a good eye. This sleeve arrow is made from the sharp thorns of a fifth-grade needle beast and can easily pierce the hard armor of a third-grade monster.\u201d The owner of the weapon shop said.\u201cHow much is it?!\u201d Xiao Jingting asked.\u201cThirty taels of silver.\u201d Xu Muan was stunned and secretly surprised.Xiao Jingting generously took out thirty taels of silver and bought it.Xu Muan stopped him and said, \u201cForget it, it\u2019s too expensive.\u201dXiao Jingting shook his head and said, \u201cIt\u2019s fine, you love going into the mountains. You need some decent weapons.\u201dXu Muan looked at Xiao Jingting\u2019s cheerful face and felt warm in his heart. Xu Muan didn\u2019t know why Xiao Jingting had become like this and only prayed secretly that Xiao Jingting would keep the way he was forever.After buying the sleeve arrows and the things needed to set up the trap, Xiao Jingting had only a small amount of silver left .\u201cDo you need to buy anything else?\u201d Xu Muan asked.\u201cIt would be better to buy a storage bag.\u201d Xiao Jingting said.Xu Muan\u2019s face went pale. The storage bag was a precious thing. A storage bag with a cubic meter space inside can sell for at least eighty taels of silver. It was a good thing but it was too expensive.Xiao Jingting looked at Xu Muan and said with a smile, \u201cI was just thinking about it. We need money to buy many things at home now, so it is not good to buy that thing at present.\u201d\u201cAre we going back now?\u201d Xu Muan asked.\u201cWe will buy some jars and go back.\u201d Xiao Jingting said.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201cWhy do you want to buy jars?\u201d Xu Muan asked.\u201cIn the future, you will know.\u201d Xiao Jingting said.Xu Muan didn\u2019t ask any more questions when he heard this words. He accompanied Xiao Jingting to buy dozens of jars, large and small, which were not expensive. They bought a pile of them but only spent one tael of silver.After shopping, Xiao Jingting and Xu Muan went out of the city and joined the people in the ox cart.Seeing Xiao Jingting and Xu Muan coming back, several villagers in the ox cart glanced at the sleeve arrows on Xu Muan\u2019s arms. Although the villagers were poor, many of them knew the goods.Xu Muan was a little embarrassed and sat down next to Xiao Jingting.\u201cXiao, you must have made a lot of money!\u201d Some villagers said.Xiao Jingting shook his head and said, \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t make much.\u201d\u201cXiao, you are too modest. Are you afraid to let us know that your husband\u2019s sleeve arrows cost dozens of taels of silver?\u201d\u201cMuan,don\u2019t go into the mountains and jungle when you have nothing to do. You don\u2019t even have a proper weapon. I\u2019m really worried about you.\u201d Xiao Jingting changed the subject.\u201cMaster Xiao, I heard that you sold the grapes to Yuehe restaurant. The grapes are valuable. How did you grow the grapes? How did you grow it like that? \u201d\u201cI just planted it casually.\u201d Xiao Jingting said faintly.Xiao Jingting lowered his eyes. In the past, when he sold the grapes, he had already attracted the attention of many people. As far as he knew, many people had learned from him to improve their soil and grow grapes. Once the grapes were sold, everyone in the village would know.If he kept selling grapes like that, he would make many people jealous, and then\u2026 \u00a0He wish he was much more powerful now, then he wouldn\u2019t care about how others thought about anymore.As if sensing Xiao Jingting\u2019s worry, Xu Muan reached out and grabbed Xiao Jingting\u2019s hand. Xiao Jingting also held Xu Muan\u2019s hand back.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 26: 26\u201cMore than a hundred taels of silver?\u201d Qiu Bai was surprised.Qiu Li nodded and said, \u201cYes! More than one hundred taels of silver and that is only part of the money made from selling the grapes. \u201dWhen all the grapes were sold, it would be much more than that.Qiu Bai couldn\u2019t help feeling regret so he thought secretly: if he had known that Xiao Jingting was so capable, he would have paid more attention to Xiao Jingting. Recently, Xiao Jingting had changed a lot, and he didn\u2019t seem to know Xiao Jingting anymore.\u201c I don\u2019t know what kind of trick Xu Muan used, to actually cause Xiao Jingting to get rid of his bad habits, and Xiao Jingting even bought him a pair of sleeve arrows, and I heard it was made from the steel needles of the fifth-grade demon beasts. It\u2019s worth more than twenty or thirty taels of silver.\u201d Qiu Li said again.All over the body of the steel needle beast, only twelve steel needles on the top of its head, were the most valuable. The steel needles were unusually sharp. Beasts like the Grade 3\u00a0 teeth- piercing Pig were unable to block the sleeve arrows\u2019 attack.Qiu Bai was a good judge of characters. At first, Xiao Jingting was indifferent to him but Qiu Bai did not take it seriously, thinking he was playing hard to get. However, after several contacts, Qiu Bai found that he was no longer in Xiao Jingting\u2019s heart. Xiao Jingting now was really too odd. In the past, this person hated farming the most, and decided that farming was something lower-class people did, but now he was doing hard labors all day outside.Xiao Jingting used to call Xiao Xiaofan a bastard, but now he \u00a0always hugged that stupid kid and talked to him with a kind face.The next day.\u201cThe grapes are not for sale? Winemaking? \u201d Xu Muan was a little hesitant.Xiao Jingting nodded and said, \u201cYes! The capacity of the market is limited. If we sell too many grapes, it will affect the price. However, it\u2019s not that we won\u2019t sell them, we\u2019ll sell them just a few days later. We\u2019ll just sell five or six hundred strings and eat the rest ourselves. \u201dXu Muan nodded and said, \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201dXiao Jingting found that although Xu Muan was young he was a very picky person.When Xu Muan was busy in the house, customers were coming to the door one after another.The fact that Xiao Jingting had made a lot of money selling grapes had completely spread, and thoseneighbors could no longer sit about so that they came to watch the scene.The Xiao family had been rarely visited by others for a long time, but now it was bustling with people.Many people stared at the grapes as soon as they entered the courtyard and wished they could move all the grapes to their own houses.Previously, when Xu Muan was poor, he had sought help from a few neighbors who came over before, however, those neighbors all pushed him aside, so Xu Muan was very indifferent to these guests now.When the guests came to the door, Xiao Jingting could not left them unattended all this time so Xiao Jingting washed two clusters of grapes and put them in the room, allowing two kids to entertain the guests, and went back to their work with Xu Muan.Xiao Jingting doesn\u2019t want to deal with those people, but those people were not easy to get rid of.\u201cMaster Xiao, you are a good grape cultivator.\u201d\u201cNo, I just planted them casually.\u201d\u201cBut these grapes grow so well. If you work harder, the grapes you plant will be even better in future.\u201d Qiu Li said.When Xiao Jingting heard Qiu Li\u2019s voice, he felt uncomfortable. \u201cI\u2019m flattered.\u201d\u201cMaster Xiao, how on earth did you grow this grape? This village is so poor and you are so wealthy. You should give everyone a hand. We are all your fellow villagers. If you give us a hand, everyone will remember your kindness.\u201d Qiu Li said.Xiao Jingting squinted. To grow the grapes well, one needed to pay attention to improving the soil quality, on the other hand, one needed to cut some unwanted branches. However, the most important thing was probably the spiritual spring water from his jade space.\u201cIt is not that I don\u2019t want to help you, but this grape-planting skill is the secret of our Xiao family. If it is leaked out, elders of the family will definitely come after me.\u201d Seeing Qiu Li try to press him to help the villagers, Xiao Jingting immediately used his families as an excuse.Hearing Xiao Jingting\u2019s words, the crowd was in an uproar.Xiao Jingting was exiled from the Xiao family, which was no secret to the villagers. At this moment, when Xiao Jingting said that grape-planting skill was the secret that Xiao family passed down, everyone immediately stopped asking Xiao Jingting to tell them the secret skill.Big families attached great importance to safeguarding family secrets. Once the secret was leaked, not only would the family member who leaked the secret be severely punished, but these who knew the secret would all be silenced.For the Xiao family, the Mound Village was too small.Xiao Jingting looked at the shocked look on everyone\u2019s faces and smiled in his heart. Using the Xiao family as an excuse was really helpful, but this was not surprising, the Xiao family could easily send a seven-level Qi practitioner to wipe the village out.Qiu Li\u2019s face turned pale and sullen, ever since the last time Qiu Bai brought back a few bunches of grapes, Qiu Li secretly cut a section of grapevine from the back mountain to plant it. However he failed to get the hang of planting grapes. His grapes were sour and puckery, and it was much different from what Xiao Jingting planted.Qiu Li originally wanted to sound out Xiao Jingting\u2019s method when so many villagers were inquiring about the grape-planting skill, but as soon as Xiao Jingting said it was a family secret, Qiu Li was too embarrassed to pursue the question.The big families in the Wasteland were able to survive, relying heavily on those family secrets. If anyone attempted to pry into the secrets of these great families, one would be considered a mortal enemy of those families.Qiu Li was helpless and could only be jealous of Xiao Jingting\u2019s background.Qiu Bai sat quietly there, eating grapes, his eyes somewhat dark.In the past, as soon as he appeared, Xiao Jingting\u2019s gaze would immediately stop moving and focus on him, but this time when he came, it was as if Xiao Jingting didn\u2019t see him. Seeing Xiao Jingting stroke Xu Muan hair, Qiu Bai felt jealous and bitter in heart.Qiu Bai picked up the grapes and ate one after another, while Xiao Xiaofan kept staring at him with wide-open big eyes.Qiu Bai was only concerned about his own appearance and paid no attention to Xiao Xiaofan\u2019s angry face, nor did he notice the strange look of everyone around him.There were plenty of grapes, and people in the village also knew that this grapes were expensive. So after eating two grapes, they stopped eating but Xiu Bai ate half string of grapes alone.\u201cWell, have you found anything yet?\u201d Seeing Qiu Bai and Qiu Li come back, their father couldn\u2019t wait to ask.During this period of time, the Qiu family spent a lot of effort growing grapes and their other work on the field was delayed. Seeing Xiao Jingting making a lot of money while they got nothing, their father felt as if there were claws scratching his heart.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Qiu Li shook his head and said, \u201cNo, Xiao Jingting said it was one of the secrets of the Xiao family.\u201d\u201cThe secret of the Xiao family?\u201d their father was stunned. \u201cVillagers had an innate respect for large families, and upon hearing that it was one of the secret of Xiao family, their father couldn\u2019t help but felt discouraged.There were countless disputes in the Wasteland. Once upon a time, a man from a village learned the secret of the Meng family\u2019s cultivation of balsamine from a spirit plant master who betrayed the Meng family, and started planting balsamine himself, but before the balsamine could grow up, everyone in that village was slaughtered.\u201cThere are several big families in the village who seem to have come up with something.\u201d Mr. Qiu said.When Qiu Li heard his words, his heart was suddenly filled with jealousy. He spent so much effort and achieved nothing. Those big families made progress by relying on the masters\u2019 ability in their big family and made progress all of a sudden.Mr. Qiu sighed and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not our money, and it\u2019s no use trying to make it!\u201d Then he changed his tone and said, \u201cHowever, if growing grapes is really the secret of the Xiao family, and those people have studied it, their death is almost due.\u201dQiu Bai lowered his head, thinking about the brocade that Xu Muan was wearing. His clothes didn\u2019t look fancy, however, Qiu Bai knew that it was not cheap.Xu Muan used to dress like a beggar, but now he looked so decent.Qiu Bai suddenly felt that it would be a good choice to marry Xiao Jingting.Xiao family.Looking at the bunches of grapes outside, his heart was filled with excitement, and Xu Muan thought: when this batch of grapes mature, they will be able to earn more than 100 taels of silver, which will be almost enough to redeem those few mu of first-class fields.This time, Xiao Jingting sold the earliest batch of ripe grapes and made the grapes from the medium-level fields into wine. When the last batch matured, Xiao Jingting said that some of these grapes were left to eat and the rest of them would be sold for money.Xu Muan turned his head and looked at the mess of cups and plates on the table and frowned. This time, there was an endless stream of guests who came to their house and then needed to be entertained. Xu Muan was reluctant to give grapes each time so he went to the street to buy some snacks and then put on two plates of grapes to make it look better. But still, it made Xu Muan heartache.Two bunches of grapes could be sold for at least four hundred copper coins, and although those snacks were much cheaper than grapes, they still costed money. Before he was even unwilling to spend a single copper coin.Xiao Xiaodong and Xiao Xiaofan helped Xu Muan clean up the house.\u201cYou\u2019re back, huh? Where did you get the pheasant?\u201d Xu Muan was curious as he looked at the pheasant in Xiao Jingting\u2019s hand.\u201cIt fell into a trap and I caught it.\u201d Xiao Jingting said.Xu Muan was stunned and then said joyfully, \u201cThat\u2019s really great.\u201dXiao Jingting nodded his head and said, \u201cYes! I\u2019ll make a spicy chicken.\u201dXu Muan nodded and said, \u201cGood!\u201dXiao Jingting looked at Xu Muan and was somewhat amused. In his previous life, Xiao Jingting liked to eat spicy food, but in this life after cooking few spicy dishes by chance he discovered that Xu Muan liked to eat spicy food much more than him.The next day, when Xiao Jingting took Xu Muan to sell grapes, he encountered some problems.Xiao Jingting originally signed contracts with the restaurant and more than a dozen families in the city. When he went to sell grapes, Yuehe Restaurant bought all the grapes they ordered as before. However, several big families refused to buy those grapes and several others wanted Xiao Jingting to reduce price. Xiao Jingting did not agree, because it was these big families who violated the contract. In the end, Xiao Jingting was unable to sell more than 200 clusters of grapes so he planned to buy more jars and make wine from all the unsold grapes.Looking at Xiao Jingting, Xu Muan said, \u201cThe owner of Yuehe Restaurant said that several big landlords have also begun to grow grapes, selling a cluster for 100 copper coins, which is much cheaper than ours, so\u2026\u201dXiao Jingting laughed and said, \u201cIf I can\u2019t sell it, I will just eat it myself. Anyway, we can eat it.\u201dXu Muan smiled. Grapes were good, \u201cThose people don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing, ah! They will regret it later.\u201dAlthough Xu Muan didn\u2019t know how Xiao Jingting\u2019s grapes were grown, he was sure that Xiao Jingting\u2019s grapes were different from those of others.Before, Xu Muan\u2019s strength depended on eating the Lieyan Herb, which had a fierce medical effect. In the process of taking it, Xu Muan\u2019s meridians were damaged and Xu Muan discovered the disadvantages of the herb. However, in order to survive and take care of the children, he had no other choice.However, recently, Xu Muan found that drinking grape juice can repair his damaged meridians. During this period, he had been eating well, and his previously damaged meridians had almost recovered.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Redeeming five mu of high-grade fields would cost one hundred and thirty taels of silver and redeeming four mu of low-class fields would cost twenty-six taels of silver. A total of 156 taels of silver.Xu Muan took out a money bag and said, \u201cHere. This is forty silvers, you can take it to redeem the land first.\u201dOriginally, if all the grapes were sold, they would have earned more than 130 taels of silver. With the money Xiao Jingting had earned before, it should be almost enough to redeem the land. However, they were unable to sell more than 200 strings of grapes and thus lost more than 50 taels of silvers as their income. Xiao Jingting did not have enough money on his hand, so Xu Muan gave him the silver Xiao Jingting had given him last time and some silver that he saved in the past.Seeing Xu Muan took out the silver he had saved in the past, Xiao Jingting was moved and after weighing the situation, he did not refuse.In fact, Xu Muan was a small money grubber and all of his silver was well hidden. Xiao Jingting was sure that the original owner of this body did not find the place where Xu Muan really hid his money before. This showed that Xu Muan who willingly took out the money had really started to trust him.\u201cIn a few days, when the spiritual plants mature, we\u2019ll have money again.\u201d Xiao Jingting said.Xu Muan nodded and said, \u201cI know, you should redeem the fields first. It will be troublesome if it turns into a dead pawn.\u201dXiao Jingting nodded and answered, \u201cGood.\u201dWhen the pawnshop owner saw that Xiao Jingting had come to redeem the fields again, his facial expression couldn\u2019t become any worse.When Xiao Jingting and Xu Muan came out of the pawnshop, they met Wang Erhu. \u201cBrother Xiao, I haven\u2019t seen you for a few days and now I heard you became rich!\u201d\u201cHow am I rich? I have spent all the money I just got. The owner of this pawnshop is really merciless! He only kept the title deed with him for a few days and when I redeemed it, I lost so much silver in vain.\u201d Xiao Jingting said with a look of dissatisfaction.Wang Erhu laughed and said, \u201cBrother Xiao! Why didn\u2019t I know you were good at growing grapes?\u201d\u201cHehe, brother Wang, you\u2019re flattering me.\u201dWang Erhu looked at Xiao Jingting and said, \u201cBrother Xiao, it\u2019s time for you to come to the city now. Why don\u2019t you go and have some fun?\u201d\u201cNow?\u201dXu Muan said angrily, \u201cYou bastard! If you keep encouraging my husband to develop a bad habit, I will kill you!\u201dXu Muan rushed over and kicked Wang Erhu to the ground. Xu Muan originally only wanted to give Wang Erhu a little lesson, but he knew that Wang Erhu was very weak. When he kicked him, he flew away directly and Xu Muan could not help feeling guilty.Xiao Jingting smiled apologetically at Wang Erhu and said, \u201cBrother Erhu, I still have something to do at home, so I won\u2019t have fun with you. If you are free, you\u2019d better go have fun by yourself.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go. You don\u2019t have to talk to such people from now on.\u201d Xu Muan said.Xiao Jingting was submissive and left with Xu Muan.Wang Erhu was a rogue and no one in the city liked him. Seeing him being taught a lesson, a lot of people laughed.Wang Erhu looked at the figures of Xiao Jingting and Xu Muan, his heart filled with resentment.Wang Erhu secretly thought:\u00a0I did not notice before that Xiao Jingting was so afraid of his wife! In the past, when Xiao Jingting mentioned his wife, he was always full of contempt. Could it be that Xu Muan used some demonic art? As far as I know, there is some kind of technique that makes people obey the words of the first person they saw when they woke up. Xu Muan wouldn\u2019t use a similar art on Xiao Jingting, would he?Bad news travelled fast. Now everyone knew Xiao Jingting\u2019s grape didn\u2019t sell well.As soon as Xiao Jingting and Xu Muan arrived outside the city, they were educated by a few passengers who came with them.\u201cMr. Xiao, I\u2019ll be frank with you. Your grapes are too expensive. No wonder they don\u2019t want to do business with you.\u201d\u201cYes! Even if you are from a big family, you need to be careful. It\u2019s no different from robbing money if you sell them for so much.\u201d\u201cMr. Xiao, I think these grapes should be sold for a smaller profit. If you drive away all customers like this, how can you still do business with people in the future?\u201dVisit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201c\u2026\u201dXiao Jingting listened to the comments of a group of chatterboxes and rolled his eyes in his heart. When he planted grapes, he used a lot of spiritual spring water, which was a good thing! Not only could it restore one\u2019s spiritual energy but it also improved one\u2019s strength. Grapes planted with spiritual spring water should be sold at a higher price. If no one bought them, he would not sell them.Seeing Xiao Jingting\u2019s indifference, Xu Muan calmed down.\u201cDaddy, the grapes have not been sold!\u201d Xiao Xiaofan bit his finger and squatted down, looking at the grapes in the basket, asking.Xu Muan nodded and said, \u201cYes! Some of them have not been sold. \u201dXiao Xiaofan looked up and said with anticipation, \u201cOh, these grapes will go bad if they are kept for too long. Why don\u2019t I help daddy and father eat them?\u201dXu Muan, \u201c\u2026\u201dXiao Xiaodong\u2019s performance was more reserved than Xiao Xiaofan, but he couldn\u2019t help but glance at the basket, which revealed Xiao Xiaodong\u2019s inner thoughts.\u201cI\u2019ll squeeze out some grape juice for you guys to drink, but only half a cup per person.\u201d Xu Muan said.Xiao Xiaofan quickly nodded and Xiao Xiaodong also revealed a look of anticipation.\u201cDaddy, why there are so many grapes that we couldn\u2019t sell?\u201d Xiao Xiaodong asked.Xu Muan helplessly said, \u201cSome big families thought they were too expensive, so they don\u2019t want them anymore.\u201dXiao Xiaodong snorted lightly and disdainfully said, \u201cThese people, they really don\u2019t know what they are doing.\u201dXiao Xiaodong was, after all, Xiao Jingting\u2019s son. When they were still in the big Xiao family, his grandfather and grandmother occasionally thought of him and gave him something to eat. Xiao Xiaodong remembered the valuable spirit fruits he had eaten, which were even more expensive than grapes, but the spiritual power they contained were not as much as grapes planted by his father.Xiao Xiaofan took a small sip of the grape juice and smacked his lips.\u201cBrother, you\u2019re so stupid! They don\u2019t know what\u2019s good and valuable, but thanks to them, we have more grapes to eat! Otherwise, you and I won\u2019t be able to eat them.\u201d Xiao Xiaofan puffed out his cheeks.Xiao Xiaodong blushed. He had always been the smartest, but his stupid brother actually said he was stupid, \u201cYou little fool, all you care about is eating.\u201dXiao Xiaofan puffed out his cheeks, full of displeasure, \u201cBrother, don\u2019t be so mean to me. You clearly are eating more than me.\u201dXiao Xiaodong\u2019s face reddened, \u201cI\u2019m older and stronger than you, so I should \u00a0eat more.\u201dXu Muan watched Xiao Xiaofan and Xiao Xiaodong quarreling and helplessly said, \u201cAlright, alright. Stop it and go to bed quickly after finishing your grape juice.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 28": "Chapter 28Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 28: 28When all fields were taken back, Xiao Jingting became a small landlord in the village.After the crops in several medium-grade fields matured one after another, they left enough for themselves to eat and sold other spiritual plants for more than 300 taels of silver. With this amount of silver, Xiao Jingting no longer needed to do everything by himself. For example, he found a few families in the village who didn\u2019t have much land, but had abundant labor force \u00a0to work for him.To cultivate the spiritual plants in a few lower-grade fields, Xiao Jingting hired two second-level masters of spiritul plants from the village to take care of them, and only went to see them once every ten days or half a month.The wages given by Xiao Jingting were not low and he also provided a good meal. So the people who took care of the land of the Xiao family were very grateful to Xiao Jingting.As the old saying went, \u201cA prodigal who returns is more precious than gold.\u201d Xiao Jingting suddenly became an inspirational role model in the village.The improvement of his reputation had also brought Xiao Jingting a moderate amount of troubles. For example, women who used to see Xiao Jingting lock his children in the house would now pester him and ask him if he was still looking for someone to work for him. The young boys and girls who used to look at him scornfully in the past now called him brother Xiao sweetly. In the past, Qiu Bai was indifferent to him but now he always came to him and showed concerns about him.\u201cGreen Cloud Grass?\u201d When Xiao Jingting returned from the field, he was grabbed by Xu Muan to talk about what he had seen in the back of the mountain.Xiao Jingting searched in his memory for this spiritual plant and there was really no impression of this kind of spiritual plant in his mind. Many plants in this world were different from his original world and the original body owner was ignorant and incompetent. Xiao Jingting was dragged down by the original body owner so he knew nothing about these things.Seeing Xiao Jingting\u2019s bewildered appearance, Xu Muan patiently explained, \u201cGreen Cloud Grass is a spirit plant that can help third and fourth level people and demonic beasts advance. Green Cloud Grass has no effect at all until it matures, and when it is close to its maturity, it will emit a strong fragrance. This fragrance will attract all the third and fourth level demon beasts around it, only when Green Cloud Grass is fully mature, will the fragrance disappear.\u201d\u201cWhen I went over there today, there was already a third-level demonic python guarding the area, I did not dare to startle it, so I retreated. The Green Cloud Grass should still need six or seven days to mature. It is not far away from our field. If it triggers a battle between demonic beasts, it will easily affect our field.\u201d Xu Muan said.Xiao Jingting thought for a while and said, \u201cYou said that the Green Cloud Grass can also improve the strength of practitioners and help them through a breakthrough.\u201dXu Muan nodded and said, \u201cYes, when Green Cloud Grass matures, crystal clear grass seeds will fall. Taking this seed with water can help one break through the bottleneck.\u201d\u201cCan we lure that demonic python away and transplant the Green Cloud Grass out of the jungle?\u201d Xiao Jingting asked.Although he had hired a number of people to help him, Xu Muan was considerate enough to do the household chores and reduce the burden on him. However, Xiao Jingting was still busy all day long. His ability to plant medium-grade fields was limited, no to mention planting high-grade fields.There were a few third-level Spiritual Plant Masters in the village, however they asked for higher payment. Moreover, they all had their own spirit fields to look after, so it wasn\u2019t cost-effective to invite them over.Seeing that there was an opportunity to improve their strength right now, Xiao Jingting was reluctant to give it up.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Xu Muan hesitated and said, \u201cGenerally speaking, it is hard for Green Cloud Grass to survive after transplanting.\u201d\u201cThen we better lure the demonic python away and destroy the Green Cloud Grass, it won\u2019t be good if there is an additional advanced monster in the jungle.\u201d Xiao Jingting said.Xiao Jingting said so, but what he thought was:\u00a0Xu Muan said that Green Cloud Grass would have a problem to survive after transplanting, which didn\u2019t mean it couldn\u2019t be done! He could try transplanting Green Cloud Grass to then bank of his spiritual spring. Spirit Spring was good! After several careful studies, Xiao Jingting found that the crops he planted could grow well as long as they were irrigated by his spiritual spring.Xu Muan nodded, pondering over it, and finally saying with some regret: \u201cAll right.\u201dAs a matter of fact, Xu Muan was very attracted to Green Cloud Grass. Recently, the food Xu Muan ate, all had strong spiritual energy. Not only Xu Muan\u2019s meridians got healed, but also he had a vague feeling of making breakthrough. However, when Green Cloud Grass\u00a0matured, it would attract at least five or six third-level or even higher level demonic beasts. Xu Muan weighed up the situation and felt that it was too risky to seek to seize the Green Cloud Grass after it matured.\u201cMuan, you know a lot!\u201d Xiao Jingting thought it was a little strange. Xu Muan was from a farming family and after marrying Xiao Jingting, he had been living in seclusion. Xiao Jingting didn\u2019t expect Xu Muan to be so knowledgeable and versatile.Xu Muan hesitated for a moment before confessing: \u201cYou have the complete collection of books about spiritual plants in your room, I\u2019ve occasionally flipped through it.\u201dThere was a library in the Xiao Jingting\u2019s room, with many books inside. Most of them were filled with erotic pictures and songs. However, there were still some normal books, a complete collection of books about spiritual plants was one of them.Although Xu Muan was Xiao Jingting\u2019s wife in name, the original Xiao Jingting didn\u2019t take Xu Muan seriously. In order to survive, Xu Muan always tried to improve himself. In fact, Xu Muan was not allowed to enter Xu Jingting\u2019s study, so Xu Muan would always calculate the time and sneak in when no one was around.Hearing Xu Muan mentioning the library, Xiao Jingting suddenly remembered those porns and immediately blushed. The original body owner was really too ignorantand didn\u2019t know how to use them.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 29: 29\u201cI\u2019ll go to the city tomorrow and do some shopping, and then we\u2019ll do it.\u201d Xiao Jingting said.Hearing what Xiao Jingting said, Xu Muan naturally had no opinion and replied, \u201cAll right.\u201dThe next day, Xu Muan looked at the things bought by Xiao Jingting, speechless.\u201cYou\u2019re back. I\u2019ve bought you a lot of things. Come and have a look.\u201d Xiao Jingting was full of excitement as he faced Xu Muan.\u201cLook at these shoes. They are called Wind Boots and can double the speed. These clothes are third-level robes that can offset 50% of the attack power. This is internal armor, which can protect key parts, and this bead, if you throw them out, they will explode. Unfortunately, they are disposable items and will be gone once used. I also bought some attack talismans. Each costs seven taels of silver. It\u2019s so damn expensive\u2026\u201dIn his two lifetimes, Xiao Jingting exceptionally valued his life, and although he coveted Green Cloud Grass that could enhance his strength, he valued his own life even more.\u201cHow much money did you spend?!\u201d Xu Muan asked Xiao Jingting who bought two sets of things. One for Xu Muan that was laid on the bed and his own set was already put on. Xiao Jingting also bought himself a pair of green bamboo swords.Xiao Jingting smiled awkwardly and said, \u201cA total of 140 taels of silver.\u201dXu Muan was stunned for a moment. After the spiritual plants from midieum-level fields were sold, they earned more than 300 taels of silver. Xiao Jingting gave him 100 taels of silver and Xu Muan thought that Xiao Jingting would spend the rest of silver for a period of time since he had more than 200 taels of silver, however, Xiao Jingting spent more than 130 taels of silver in one go. During this period, Xiao Jingting also spent a lot of money on long-term workers and if they went on like this, 200 taels of silver would not be enough to spend at all.Xu Muan secretly said to himself:\u00a0Xiao Jingting has changed a lot recently, but his habit of lavish spending has not changed! However it is still better for Xiao Jingting to buy practical things rather than spending it on eating, drinking, whoring and gambling.\u00a0Although he tried his best to comfort himself, Xu Muan couldn\u2019t help feeling pain.\u201cWell, I was born to be useful, and even if I run out of money, I will start all over again. Try them!\u201d Seeing Xu Muan in pain, Xiao Jingting comforted him.Xu Muan nodded and said, \u201cAll right!\u201dThe next day, Xiao Xiaofan and Xiao Xiaodong were told to take good care of their house as Xiao Jingting walked towards the mountains with Xu Muan.\u201cMaster Xiao, going to the fields?!\u201d\u201cMaster Xiao, next time you\u2019re looking for someone to farm, remember to look for the one in my house.\u201d\u201cMaster Xiao, you really look good in this outfit!\u201d\u201cMaster Xiao, is it your newly bought sword? It suits you well. \u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dXu Muan tilted his head and looked at Xiao Jingting, saying: \u201cYou have become a popular man now.\u201dXiao Jingting laughed and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dWhen Xu Muan and Xiao Jingting reached the wilderness, they unexpectedly found a snake and eagle fighting. Seeing this, Xu Muan and Xiao Jingting were stunned for a moment and quickly hid themselves.Humans and demonic beasts were natural enemies, and when demonic beasts encountered people in the wild, those fighting monsters could easily work together to deal with the humans first.\u201cI miscalculated. Green Cloud Grass has already started to emit its fragrance.\u201d It was just that the fragrance was still light.Xiao Jingting nodded and said, \u201cIt is fine, the wilderness is unpredictable.\u201dThe giant snake and the eagle fought a fierce battle.A small snake fell down from the top of the tree, startling Xiao Jingting, which immediately attracted the attention of two fighting demonic beasts.\u201cI\u2019ll distract them and you destroy Green cloud grass.\u201d Xu Muan made a quick decision and jumped from under the tree, attacking two demonic beasts when he was still in the air. Attracting them to chase after him.Although he was worried about Xu Muan\u2019s safety, Xiao Jingting did not dare to give up on the opportunity Xu Muan had secured for him. He quickly jumped down the tree and threw Green Cloud Grass into the jade pendant space.A roar of fierce eagle rang out. Xiao Jingting was shocked, since he did not expect that demonic beast would return so quickly.It turned out that after the giant eagle was led away by Xu Muan, it suddenly noticed that the scent of the Green Cloud Grass had disappeared so it left the giant snake and Xu Muan and ran back. When the giant snake saw the eagle turn back, he didn\u2019t bother to pay attention to Xu Muan and also turned back.When Xu Muan saw the giant eagle and snake run back, he could only turn back as well.\u201cRun.\u201d Xu Muan shouted.Xiao Jingting quickly ran away, only hating that his parents hadn\u2019t given him an additional pair of legs.Seeing Green Cloud Grass disappear, the angry giant eagle chased after Xiao Jingting, swinging its sharp claws towards his back.Xu Muan shot three arrows toward the giant eagle; one aimed at the throat and the others at its wings.Two of the three arrows failed but one hit the giant eagle\u2019s wing. Xu Muan sleeve arrows were so sharp that they pierced through the wing, making the giant eagle\u2019s flight very unstable.Xiao Jingting didn\u2019t have time to celebrate since the python had already rushed towards him. Xiao Jingting immediately made a decision and threw out the black beads, which exploded, shattering a few scales on top of the python\u2019s head.Xiao Jingting looked at the python, which was still showing its sharp teeth and waving its claws, and he cursed the treacherous businessman who sold him these beads in mind.A sleeve arrow shot towards the demonic python, making it scream immediately.Xiao Jingting excitedly took out his stack of talismans and smashed them at the demonic python.Taking advantage of the python\u2019s dizziness, he hit with his two swords at the demonic python\u2019s wound.The giant eagle in the sky, seeing the miserable situation of the demonic python flew away gloomily.Xu Muan took back the sleeve arrows he shot out. There were six arrows in this set and within a certain distance, the sleeve would sense the sleeve arrow and make them return automatically.Xiao Jingting looked at the dead python in shock and touched his own chest.\u201cAre you alright?\u201d Xu Muan asked as he walked toward Xiao Jingting.Xiao Jingting shook his head and said, \u201cIt\u2019s all right. Are you okay? What\u2019s the matter with you? You look like you\u2019re not in a good mood!\u201d\u201cThe arrow just now hit the wing of the flying eagle, and this eagle took one of my sleeve arrows away.\u201d Xu Muan was a little regretful. A set of sleeve arrows could play an important role. If one of them was missing, it could be much worse. The sleeve arrow was the first precious gift given to him by Xiao Jingting, so Xu Muan actually cherished it very much.\u201cIt is alright. In the future, I\u2019ll buy you a better one.\u201d Xiao Jingting did not care about it.Xu Muan suppressed the sense of loss in his heart, he nodded and said, \u201cPack up and let\u2019s go.\u201dXiao Jingting nodded and said, \u201cOkay!\u201dXiao Jingting murmured, \u201cOne talisman costs seven taels of silver, and now five of them have been used. Twelve taels of silver for one black bead. This is a big loss.\u201d To beat this demonic python, Xiao Jingting spent 47 taels of silver. This demonic python was blown up and tattered, selling it would earn them no more than 20 taels of silver. If Xiao Jingting was just hunting, it would have been a big loss.Xu Muan smiled and said, \u201cAs long as we\u2019re not hurt, we can always earn more silver.\u201dVisit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Xu Muan privately felt that Xiao Jingting fighting quality was too poor, moreover, he could not cope with the situation on the spot and he seemed to be afraid of snakes. Talismans were expensive and many people only used them to save their own lives, but Xiao Jingting used them like they were worthless. It was such a waste. Xu Muan was afraid to speak these words to Xiao Jingting so he just thought about it in his heart.\u201cAm I acting too badly?\u201d Xiao Jingting asked, his accuracy seemed to be too poor, and if that was not true, he would not have wasted so much silver.Xu Muan laughed and said, \u201cAfter all, you are still a novice! All beginners are like this. When I first started hunting demonic beasts, I was also at a loss. A first grade beast could frighten me to death.\u201dXiao Jingting and Xu Muan packed the body of the python before leaving the jungle.Although Xiao Jingting chose a secluded road, they still met many people. Xiao Jingting was now a popular figure in the village and he couldn\u2019t keep a low profile even even if he wanted to.\u201cMaster Xiao, you are really amazing. You killed such a big snake.\u201d\u201cMaster Xiao, you\u2019re amazing! Look at this snake, it had no power to fight you back!\u201d\u201cMaster Xiao, you are really capable! You can hunt as well as farm.\u201d\u201cMaster Xiao, a snake of this size may sell for more than 20 taels of silver. You can really make a lot of money now!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dWhen Xiao Jingting was praised by villagers, his face flushed with shame. His combat effectiveness was really not strong and if it wasn\u2019t for the fact that he was well prepared, he would have been already in the python\u2019s stomach.The news that Xiao Jingting had killed a large python spread quickly, causing the villagers\u2019 evaluation of Xiao Jingting to rise to another level.Xiao Jingting went back and made a big meal of peppered python meat. Xu Muan had never eaten such delicious python\u2019s meat and carelessly ate till his belly became rounded.The python\u2019s meat was a little tough so Xiao Xiaofan and Xiao Xiaodong ate very slowly. When Xiao Xiaofan saw Xu Muan eating so fast he anxiously scratched his cheek, \u201cDaddy, you need to eat slower, wait for me!\u201dXu Muan turned his head to look at Xiao Xiaofan\u2019s sorrowful look, then looked at Xiao Jingting seemingly smiling face and blushed.Xiao Xiaodong glared at Xiao Xiaofan and said, \u201cEat your food, you talk too much.\u201d\u201cHurry, just eat, it\u2019s a blessing to be able to eat!\u201d Xiao Jingting said as he gave Xu Muan another few pieces of meat, making Xu Muan face even redder.\u201cMaster Xiao, there\u2019s a letter for you.\u201d As the Xiao family ate their meal, the messenger\u2019s voice rang out, rescuing the embarrassed Xu Muan.Xu Muan walked out the door and paid the delivery fee and as he took the letter from the messenger\u2019s hand. He opened it and began to read.\u201cWho sent this letter?\u201d Xiao Jingting asked.\u201cIt\u2019s from the steward of the Xiao family, named Xiao Ping.\u201dThe letter came from Xiao Ping, three years ago, Xiao Ping was an odd-job man in the Xiao family. At that time Xiao Ping\u2019s son was ill and needed a grade-three grass to save his life. The first-grade grass was everywhere, but it was not easy to cultivate it to the third grade. Xiao Ping was in a low position at that time and had no choice but to turn to Xu Muan for help.Xu Muan had the title of Xiao Jingting wife at that time but had no real power at all. He couldn\u2019t really help Xiao Ping, but he still thought of a way and it worked.There was a first-grade field in Xiao Jingting\u2019s courtyard, which was planted with a lot of exotic flowers and plants that were of little or no use. They were under the care of a fourth level spiritual planting master on a regular basis. Xu Muan secretly planted the first-grade ground grass into this flower bed.Ground grass was no different from ordinary grass and no one found or took it seriously for a while.With the nourishment of first-grade spiritual field, and the fourth level spirit planting master\u2019s unintentional care, the ground grass was indeed cultivated to a third-grade level.Xiao Ping was later promoted by the head of the Xiao family and then promoted step by step, but he never forgot Xu Muan\u2019s kindness. Xu Muan identity was special and Xiao Ping had never revealed his relationship with Xu Muan in front of people so only a few people knew they were actually on good terms.\u201cWhat does he say in the letter?\u201d Xiao Jingting asked curiously.Xu Muan looked sullen as he said, \u201cSomething happened to your second brother.\u201dXiao Jingting was suddenly alarmed. The original body owner\u2019s second brother Xiao Jinfeng had three attributes of metal, fire, and earth, although he has some attributes suitable for farming, his earth qualifications were very low and not valued by the Xiao family. In Xiao Jingting impression, the bigger the family was, the more they valued their children. The children with strong wood attributes would be given priority.Xiao Jinfeng was a very progressive person, completely different from the original body owner. But the treatment Xiao Jingting got was still much better than Xiao Jinfeng in the Xiao family. However, Xiao Jinfeng was at level four while Xiao Jingting was only at level three.Three years ago, Xiao Jinfeng joined a mercenary team and spent his time with them. In his impression, the original body owner looked down on his second brother because of his mediocre qualifications. Xiao Jinfeng on the other hand, hated the original body owner, who was an uneducated scum, making the relationship between the two brothers very rigid.\u201cWhat happened to my second brother?\u201d Xiao Jingting asked.\u201cHe robbed Zhou family\u2019s young master Zhou Kangqi of his prey and injured someone. He was expelled from the mercenary team. After returning to the Xiao family, he did not want to repent and attempted to rape Feng Xueer, the wife of his cousin Xiao Muhong. Then he was also expelled from the family.\u201d Xu Muan frowned.\u201cBullshit.\u201d Xiao Jingting said angrily.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 30": "Chapter 30Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 30: 30Xiao Jingting\u2019s face became dark and full of anger. How could Xiao Jinfeng be that kind of person?Xiao Jinfeng had also been in the mercenary team for three years and done many tasks with them. This mercenary team was really too cold-hearted to expel Xiao Jinfeng. He didn\u2019t believe Xiao Jinfeng would rob Zhou Kangqi of his prey. There must be some misunderstanding. The Zhou family and the Xiao family were old enemies. It was possible that Zhou Kangqi, seeing that the Xiao family was not as strong as it used to be, deliberately suppressed Xiao Jinfeng.The Zhou family plotted against Xiao Jinfeng and Xiao family did not even give Xiao Jinfeng a chance to defend himself. The Xiao family was really in a mess. And since when did Feng Xue\u2019er become Xiao Muhong\u2019s wife? Feng Xue\u2019er was originally a dancer from a dance house, who was taken and accepted as a concubine by Xiao Muhong, so she was not respected as a proper concubine in many people\u2019s eyes.It was ridiculous to expel the Xiao family\u2019s rightful young master for the sake of a dancing girl.Xiao Jingting knew about Xiao Jinfeng\u2019s character. This person took evil and injustice as his own enemy and was somewhat rigidly upright, so it was impossible for him to do such a thing. Besides, Xiao Jinfeng may be good at drinking, but he was by no means good at womanizing.\u201cGrandfather didn\u2019t say anything and just watched second brother get expelled from the house?\u201d Xiao Jingting asked with some dissatisfaction.Xu Muan shook his head and said, \u201cYour grandfather is in seclusion.\u201dLooking at Xiao Jingting\u2019s appearance, Xu Muan could not help being surprised. Xiao Jingting and Xiao Jinfeng did not get along, Xiao Jinfeng once had even taught Xiao Jingting a lesson. Xiao Jingting was always calling Xiao Jinfeng \u201cbastard\u201d or 'son of a bitch\u201d behind his back. Xu Muan thought that Xiao Jingting would gloat at Xiao Jinfeng\u2019s downfall.\u201cGrandfather really has a big heart.\u201d Xiao Jingting said with dissatisfaction.\u201cRecently what he concerns about is how to prolong his own life. He has more than one son and even more grandchildren. Xiao Jingfeng\u2019s attributes are not good so he has not been valued. Your grandfather has not been in charge of family matters for a long time and he doesn\u2019t bother to care about such things.\u201d Xu Muan shook his head.Xiao Jingting\u2019s father, Xiao Linfeng, was the second son at the seventh level of Qi Practice and his mother, Wang Lu, was a level six Qi Practitioner.Xiao Jingting\u2019s uncle, Xiao Chengfeng, was the first son at the sixth level of Qi Practice and his wife Liu Xiu was a level five Qi Practitioner. Xiao Muhong was the eldest son of Xiao Chengfeng and Liu Xian.Xiao Linfeng and Xiao Chengfeng had the same father but different mother, so they had been competing openly and secretly with each other. When the original body owner\u2019s parents were present, they steadily suppressed Xiao Chengfeng. Now that the original body owner\u2019s parents were dead, Xiao Chengfeng would not let go of this opportunity to suppress his second brother.\u201cThe Xiao family will experience many changes!\u201d Xiao Jingting shook his head and thought: First the original body\u2019s owner was expelled, then his second elder brother was also framed. Xiao Jingting\u2019s lineage could be said to be completely suppressed.Xiao Jingting smiled bitterly, compared to the tactics used against the original body owner\u2019s second elder brother, their eldest uncle\u2019s wife Liu Xian was quite nice to the original body owner.\u201cDid the letter say anything about my second brother\u2019s whereabouts?\u201d Xiao Jingting asked.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Xu Muan was stunned as he said, \u201cDo you want to invite your second brother to our place?\u201dXiao Jingting nodded and said, \u201cYes, our family can afford to shelter my second brother.\u201d The second elder brother of the original body owner was a loyal and righteous person, and his strength was not weak. After all, Xiao Jingting and Xu Muan were short of hands. If he could have Xiao Jingfeng come to live with them, their family would also be more lively.Xu Muan hesitated for a moment before he said, \u201cYour elder brother seems to be injured.\u201dXiao Jingting frowned and hesitated. Reasonably speaking, he should go and pick up Xiao Jingfeng, but once he left, all the work in the field would be delayed\u2026 this was the original body owner\u2019s brother after all! Inheriting the original body, Xiao Jingting also felt a sense of blood connection with his relatives.\u201cI have to go.\u201d Xiao Jingting deliberated for a moment.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to go there, I\u2019ll go.\u201d Xu Muan hesitated for a moment.\u201cYou will go?\u201d Xiao Jingting asked.Xu Muan nodded and said, \u201cThe work in the fields can\u2019t be done without you. It is hard for our family to become better, so we can\u2019t give up halfway.\u201d\u201cMoreover, you should not show up now, I always felt that after we have arrived here your uncle and aunt have not relaxed their surveillance on you. You were sent here for self-cultivation. If you leave hastily, you will be scolded by them. If you go to see your second elder brother at this time, they will be even more suspicious of you. It\u2019s better for me to go. I just hope you can take care of our two children while I am gone.\u201dXiao Jingting nodded and said, \u201cAll right.\u201d He wasn\u2019t familiar with this world yet, and he had far less experience than Xu Muan. Xu Muan looked quiet and meek but in fact, he was very smart and had great ideas.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Not only will he not be fierce but he will give you lots of delicious food.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Xiao Xiaofan raised his head to look at Xu Muan and asked.Xu Muan nodded and said, \u201cYes!\u201dHearing that Xu Muan was leaving, Xiao Xiaofan was initially a little worried, but after being comforted by Xu Muan, he went to sleep without a worry.Xiao Xiaodong looked at Xu Muan anxiously and whispered, \u201cDaddy, do you really trust him? Although he has changed a lot lately, but in the past, he\u2026 \u201d\u201cActually, daddy is also a bit worried, but your second uncle was good to you and daddy can\u2019t ignore it when he is in trouble.\u201d Before, when Xiao Xiaofan was seriously ill, Xiao Jinfeng had just come back. Helpless, Xu Muan had no choice but to ask Xiao Jinfeng for help. Xiao Jinfeng looked cold-hearted and unkind, but was actually warm-hearted and had secretly helped them a few times.Xiao Xiaodong nodded and said, \u201cI know.\u201d\u201cHere are twenty taels of silver. If there is something wrong with your father, escape to the town with your brother and live there for a while and wait for daddy to come back.\u201d Xu Muan instructed.Xiao Xiaodong nodded his head and said, \u201cI understand.\u201dXiao Xiaodong looked towards Xiao Xiaofan, Xiao Xiaofan was hugging a corner of the blanket and sleeping sweetly. Xiao Xiaodong looked at Xiao Xiaofan\u2019s carefree appearance and felt speechless.The next day before dawn, Xu Muan was ready to leave. Xiao Jingting woke up early in the morning and gave Xu Muan another 50 taels of silver. \u201cIt\u2019s better for you to bring more money to defend yourself when you\u2019re going away from home.\u201d\u201cBut our family also needs silver.\u201d Xu Muan hesitated.Xiao Jingting smiled unconcernedly and said, \u201cIt is all right, there\u2019s no shortage of food at home. I have already reserved the wages for the two second level spiritual planters I hired. You need to spend money everywhere when you go out and my second elder brother is injured. An ordinary injury should be nothing to him. Since they say he is seriously injured, I don\u2019t think it will be easy to heal. Just buy any medicinal materials he needs.\u201dXu Muan nodded and said, \u201cAlright, I\u2019m leaving.\u201dXiao Jingting nodded and instructed, \u201c\u201dBe careful on the way.\u201dXu Muan nodded, and felt a surge of reluctance in his heart. Xu Muan pressed it down and turned around to leave.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201cWake up, time for breakfast.\u201d Xiao Jingting knocked on the door of Xiao Xiaodong and Xiao Xiaofan\u2019s room.Hearing that breakfast is ready, Xiao Xiaofan jumped out of bed, put on a pair of slippers and happily walked out.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Xiao Xiaodong looked at Xiao Xiaofan\u2019s happy appearance and became speechless.Xiao Xiaofan sat down at the dining table, only then finding that something different, so he immediately cried out, \u201cDaddy is missing.\u201dXiao Xiaodong stared angrily at Xiao Xiaofan as he came over and said, \u201cDaddy already left.\u201d\u201cOh!\u201d Xiao Xiaofan said.\u201cYour daddy went back to his family, when someone asks you where daddy goes, just say so, okay?\u201d Xiao Jingting instructed.Xiao Xiaofan believed it and wondered, \u201cDaddy went back to his family? Why would daddy go back to his family? Grandpa doesn\u2019t treat daddy well.\u201dXiao Jingting\u2019s face was strangely pale, \u201cYour grandfather is not good to your daddy?\u201dXiao Xiaofan nodded and said, \u201cYes! Grandpa always asks daddy for money and he always scolds daddy for being incompetent and being unable to make his husband satisfied. He also said that daddy is wasting money on Xiaofan. Grandpa is not kind to daddy at all, but he is very kind to the younger uncle who has metal and wood affinity. Grandpa said that the little uncle was going to become a great man in the future.\u201dXiao Jingting frowned. The original body owner\u2019s father-in-law was this kind of person?Xiao Xiaodong impatiently looked at Xiao Xiaofan and said, \u201cJust eat, stop talking those nonsense.\u201dXiao Xiaofan looked at Xiao Xiaodong in aggravation, venting his anger as he started eating rice.Xiao Jingting searched painstakingly through his memory and finally found such a person. The father-in-law of the original body owner once seemed to try to get close to the original body owner. However, the original body owner found someone to drive him away.The marriage between the original body owner and Xu Muan was arranged by the eldest aunt of the original body owner. Because Xu Muan was born in a humble family, the parents of the original body owner did not approve of this marriage.At that time, Xu Muan was already pregnant, and Xiao Jingting had a bad reputation. He was not good enough for decent boys and girls but was too good for a lowborn. So the eldest aunt said they should let the original Xiao Jingting marry Xu Muan first and when there would be a better one, it would not be a big deal to break off with Xu Muan. In this way, the original owner\u2019s parents agreed half-heartedly.The Xiao family was located in Desert City and was one of the four big families in Desert City. The person the original Xiao Jingting liked was Sun Xiaomiao, the unruly daughter of the Sun family, who had the same attributes as Xiao Jingting. Miss Sun was hot-tempered and rejected the original body owner. After the original body owner was rejected, he became more and more affectionate towards this little girl.After the original body owner got married, he still missed Sun Miaomiao. Naturally, Miss Sun didn\u2019t like Xiao Jingting, this good-for-nothing, and the marriage of the former just gave her an excuse to reject him. The original body owner believed her and despised Xu Muan even more, always thinking of abandoning Xu Muan.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After the Grass was planted into the space, under the watering of the spiritual spring, it survived. Shortly after Xu Muan left this morning, the seed fell.Xiao Xiaodong watched Xiao Jingting enter the house and secretly thought:\u00a0As soon as daddy was absent, his father became lazy. After eating, he just went back into the house to sleep.Xiao Xiaodong cleaned up the dishes and began his cleaning work.After taking the Green Cloud Grass, Xiao Jingting felt a strong aura washing over his body, Xiao Jingting sat in a meditating posture on his bed and absorbed the spiritual energy in the air as a stream of aura seeped into his body. Xiao Jingting only felt like he was soaked in warm water which made him feel extremely comfortable.Two hours later, Xiao Jingting finally achieved his goal of becoming a fourth level Qi Practitioner.Xiao Jingting stretched his body for a while, only to feel that the strength in his body was more than two or three times greater than before.Xiao Jingting went out the door and found that the bowls and chopsticks that were used this morning had been all cleaned up. Xiao Xiaodong was standing on a small stool to stir fry vegetables and Xiao Xiaofan was adding fuel to the fire. Seeing this scene, Xiao Jingting could not help feeling guilty.\u201cLet me cook.\u201d Xiao Jingting said to the two children.Xiao Xiaodong looked at Xiao Jingting and said, \u201cFather, you have worked hard recently, you better have a good rest. Besides, the food is almost ready.\u201dXiao Jingting, \u201c\u2026\u201d What a considerate child! He is totally different from the spoiled children on the Earth who only knew how to make trouble.Xiao Jingting ate a meal cooked by Xiao Xiaodong.\u201cBrother, the food you made is terrible!\u201d Xiao Xiaofan was holding his rice bowl and wrinkling his nose.Xiao Xiaodong\u2019s face suddenly blushed as he said, \u201cEat your food.\u201dXiao Xiaodong secretly thought:\u00a0In the past when his daddy was away, he was the one who cooked for Xiao Xiaofan most of the time. Xiao Xiaofan had a big appetite, no matter what food he made, Xiaofan would eat a lot every time. After eating a few good meals, this little boy actually started disliking the food he made. What a jerk!Xiao Jingting laughed and said, \u201cXiaofan doesn\u2019t know how to appreciate it. In fact, you did a good job, Xiaodong.\u201dHearing the words, Xiao Xiaodong quickly lowered his head and his face became a little red.\u201cFather, where are you going this afternoon?\u201d Xiao Xiaofan asked.\u201cTo the fields.\u201d Xiao Jingting said.\u201cI\u2019ll go with you.\u201d Xiao Xiaofan was full of enthusiasm.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Xiao Jingting nodded and said, \u201cAll right!\u201dXiao Jingting took Xiao Xiaofan and Xiao Xiaodong to the field. Fortunately, he had not met Qiu Bai recently.Half a month ago, Qiu Bai appeared at his side at all times, like an evil spirit, making Xiao Jingting feel a little uneasy. Under Xiao Jingting\u2019s persistent refusal, Qiu Bai finally did not appear again.Xiao Jingting did not know that after he redeemed all the fields, the village people\u2019s view of him had changed a lot.The prodigal had corrected his mistakes and started making money. For a while, all kinds of praising words about Xiao Jingting spread in the village.Qiu Bai heard a lot of people praise Xiao Jingting and watched Xu Muan follow Xiao Jingting to eat and drink and Xiao Jingting buying all sorts of expensive clothes and weapons for Xu Muan. Qiu Bai gradually changed his view of Xiao Jingting and felt it would be a good thing to become Xiao Jingting\u2019s wife.Qiu Bai also discovered that Xiao Jingting attitude towards him was different from before, but Qiu Bai still felt that as long as he forsake his reserved manners, Xiao Jingting would still be tempted. How could he know that every time he approached Xiao Jingting, Xiao Jingting would behave like seeing a monster and retreat.The villagers liked the gossip of fellow villagers the most and soon Qiu Bai\u2019s failure in pestering of Xiao Jingting had become the hot topic of the village.Qiu Bai was good-looking but arrogant. There were many people in the village who did not like him. For a while, rumors that Xiu Bai was not wanted and shamelessly pestered Xiao Jingting but failed went viral amongst the villagers.Qiu Bai cared about his reputation the most, so after hearing those rumors, he decided to 'stop talking to Xiao Jingting for a few days.\u201d This decision of Qiu Bai made Xiao Jingting very happy.After a few days of avoiding meeting Xiao Jingting, Qiu Bai heard from Qiu Li that Xiao Jingting was still busy with farming and hunting all day as usual, so he couldn\u2019t help being angry.\u201cBrother, how is Xiao Jingting?\u201dQiu Li was envious as he said, \u201cHe\u2019s in the spotlight. He asked people to raise plants in his land, bought cultivator robes, weapons and talismans and yesterday he even hunted a snake that everyone envied. The snake was obviously smashed to death by the talisman and when the snake is smashed like this, money spent on talisman will not be paid off. Anyone could do it, but people in the village praised Xiao Jingting as if he was the reincarnation of the God of War. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with those guys. \u201dQiu Li was regarded as a leader among the young people in the village, but now he was suppressed by Xiao Jingting, which made him feel very unpleasant.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 33": "Chapter 33Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 33: 33Xiao Jingting took Xiao Xiaofan and Xiao Xiaodong in the direction of the middle-grade field when suddenly an eagle cry came over.A giant eagle was hovering in the sky, and Xiao Jingting protected the two children behind him as if he was facing a fierce enemy.Under normal circumstances, no demon beast would enter the village. But as Xiao Jingting looked at the giant eagle in the sky, he recognized it at once, that giant eagle was the same one that fought with the python before.That day, the giant eagle retreated angrily, but today it probably saw him being alone and rushed over to provoke him.Since Xiao Jingting was going to the field for farm work, he did not expect to encounter such a tough monster, so he didn\u2019t bring his green bamboo sword.Xiao Jingting waved his hand and spawned two thorn vines that pierced the giant eagle\u2019s belly. As soon as Xiao Jingting did so, he found that the speed of spawning the thorny vines was two or three times faster than usual. Xiao Jingting calmed down at once. The giant eagle was injured and he had ascended to another level. Without any accident, his chances of winning were great.Xiao Xiaodong looked nervous as he protected Xiao Xiaofan behind him, watching Xiao Jingting fight with the giant eagle. Xiao Xiaofan blinked his eyes, nervous and curious as he looked at Xiao Jingting.Xiao Jingting who had calmed down, fought with all his strength. The rain of arrows from all over the sky rushed towards the giant eagle. The vines on the ground split into two and the latter in four as they pierced straight into giant eagle\u2019s belly.Seeing the arrow on the wing of the giant eagle, Xiao Jingting eyes suddenly lit up. The arrow that Xu Muan shot at the giant eagle last time had not been taken out.Xiao Jingting commanded the vines to wrap around the arrow on the giant eagle and ruthlessly pulled it out.The moment the arrow was pulled out, blood spurted out and the giant eagle became very unstable while flying.Taking advantage of its weakness, Xiao Jingting became more fierce in his attack.The giant eagle screamed, as if it understood that the fight was over. The giant eagle, filled with hatred, pounced in the direction of Xiao Xiaodong behind Xiao Jingting. Xiao Jingting then threw out a rune to block the attack of the giant eagle.The giant eagle was blown up by Xiao Jingting and he immediately spawned countless vines to wrap around the eagle\u2019s neck, strangling it.\u201cWell done, father is really powerful!\u201d Xiao Xiaofan clapped his hands, full of admiration.Xiao Jingting uneasily made a few cuts on the giant eagle before allowing those vines to disappear.While Xiao Xiaofan was bouncing and jumping excitedly, Xiao Xiaodong thought of something deeper.\u201cFather, your strength seemed to have risen!\u201d Xiao Xiaodong said.Xiao Jingting smiled and did not say anything, secretly thinking:\u00a0This little guy Xiao Xiaodong has a sensitive heart, and sometimes his mind is even more complicated than an adult\u2019s.Xiao Jingting put away the giant eagle and said contentedly, \u201cI won\u2019t go to the field today. I\u2019ll go to sell the eagle and exchange it for some silver.\u201dXu Muan left and there was still a lot of python meat at home, but there were only three mouths in the house, although Xiao Xiaofan was a foodie, and had a big appetite, he couldn\u2019t eat much. The eagle meat will not be delicious after some time so he might as well exchange it for some silver.Although the python skin at home was a little shabby, it should still be able to sell for a few taels of silver.When Xu Muan left, Xiao Jingting gave Xu Muan all of his family\u2019s money. His pockets were empty so Xiao Jingting was a little uncomfortable.Xiao Jingting smiled bitterly in his heart. After he came to this world, he always seemed to toss himself into poverty, fortunately this giant eagle was in good shape and he should be able to sell it for more than thirty taels of silver.Xiao Jingting\u2019s eyes were casually slanted as he saw the usually the admiration in Xiao Xiaodong\u2019s eyes. Seeing Xiao Jingting\u2019s gaze, he returned to his serious appearance.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Xiao Xiaodong was after all a child, and children worshiped heroes. Just now Xiao Jingting \u201cheroic performance\u201d let Xiao Xiaodong change his impression of Xiao Jingting.Xiao Jingting laughed bitterly in his heart. This child was still so young but was just like a little old man.Seeing the crisis averted, a few villagers came out and greeted Xiao Jingting. Xiao Jingting had already noticed them when he fought with the giant eagle. When people came out, Xiao Jingting looked just like usual.A few villagers praised Xiao Jingting, and some of them were sharp-minded enough to inquire about his strength, but Xiao Jingting was vague and exchanged pleasantries with the crowd for a while before he was able to get away.\u2014\u2013Qiu family.\u201cBrother, you said that Xiao Jingting is a level 4 Qi Practitioner?\u201d Qiu Bai asked.Qiu Li nodded and said, \u201cThe few villagers who saw Xiao Jingting fight said so. It is also possible that they are mistaken.\u201dQiu Bai secretly thought to himself:\u00a0Although the villagers like to gossip, there are no waves without the wind. It wasn\u2019t impossible to say that Xiao Jingting was really a fourth level Qi Practitioner. A fourth and third level Qi Practitioner were not the same. There are several level four spiritual planters in the village. However, they are all old men, while Xiao Jingting was too young.Xiao Jingting was so good at farming at the third level. Now that he was at fourth level, the spiritual plants he planted could be even more high-end, and he wouldearn more money.Qiu Bai cursed himself for being blind and not grasping the opportunity. Xiao Jingting was so skillful, so it was not impossible that in the future he would advance to the sixth or seventh level.\u201cYounger brother, Xiao Jingting seems to be very indifferent to you recently.\u201d Qiu Li said.Qiu Bai bowed his head. Indifferent? He was not even sure if Xiao Jingting\u2019s attitude to him could even be described by this word.Qiu Li looked at Qiu Bai and said, \u201cRecently, Xiao Jingting has changed quite a lot. All of those coquettish persons are ready to make their move. I can see that Xiao Jingting isn\u2019t playing hard to get, he seems to be really tired of you. All of those young masters of the big family fall in and out of love easily. \u00a0They are really not good men.\u201dSeeing that Xiao Jingting had become rich, Qiu Li occasionally asked Qiu Bai to go ask him for some benefits. However, Xiao Jingting had changed a lot. Sometimes, he would slip away without waiting for Qiu Bai to speak and sometimes, when Qiu Bai opened his mouth, Xiao Jingting made excuses, or got away with some pretexts.Qiu Bai returned again and again without any success, which made Qiu Li disappointed with him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 34": "Chapter 34Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 34: 34There was no impenetrable wall in the world, and the news of Xu Muan\u2019s going back to his family spread like wildfire two days after Xu Muan left.In the absence of Xu Muan, many matchmakers poured in, disturbing Xiao Jingting.Xiao Jingting was annoyed, and Xiao Xiaodong looked like he was facing an archenemy, fearing that someone would wreck their family by taking advantage of Xu Muan\u2019s absence.When Xiao Xiaodong saw those matchmakers bring people to their door, he would take his younger brother to stare at those people, but the stare of a child did not have much intimidating power so the people who came completely ignored Xiao Xiaodong and Xiao Xiaofan.People were coming and going, and some of them even came to their door early in the morning, which made them delay their work in the fields.Xiao Jingting was forced to think of a solution. In the end, Xiao Jingting made two simple water guns for Xiao Xiaofan and Xiao Xiaodong by using bamboo.The childhood of Xiao Xiaofan and Xiao Xiaodong was very boring and they didn\u2019t have any toys so after getting the water guns, they instantly loved them.The next day, Xiao Jingting went out early in the morning. Xiao Xiaofan and Xiao Xiaodong in the courtyard played with water guns. When they encountered someone who came to their door, they would spray those individuals with their water guns, making all of them drenched. At the end of the day, the results were remarkable as girls and boys who came with fancy clothes and makeup become embarrassed, so the number of guests who came to their door the next day was sharply reduced by half.\u2026..\u2026On the other side, Xiao Jinfeng\u2019s whereabouts were uncertain. Xu Muan managed to find Xiao Jinfeng\u2019s trail by chance seven days after he went out.When Xu Muan found Xiao Jinfeng, the latter was in bad health. Xiao Ping said in the letter that Xiao Jinfeng was injured but Xu Muan found that Xiao Jinfeng was not injured, but poisoned.The poison of the Colorful Phoenix Spider that Xiao Jinkeng was poisoned with, would gradually erode the Qi in his body, gradually turning him into a useless person without any spiritual energy at all.The poison of the Colored Phoenix Spider would require a fourth-grade antidote, the Bixin pill. The market value of Bixin pill was one thousand taels of silver, which was a large sum of money for small families. However, for the big Xiao family which ran equally big businesses, it was not a large sum.If the original owner\u2019s parents were still around, detoxifying Xiao Jinfeng\u2019s poison wouldn\u2019t be a difficult task, but now the one in charge was Xiao Jinfeng\u2019s uncle\u2019s family.After Xiao Jinfeng returned to Xiao family, Xiao Chengfeng pretended to be very concerned about Xiao Jinfeng\u2019s case, and even asked people to find out the whereabouts of the antidote but secretly repeatedly delayed Xiao Jinfeng\u2019s treatment. When Xiao Jinfeng was accused of raping Xiao Muhong \u201cwife\u201d, Xiao Chengfeng scolded Xiao Jinfeng for being ungrateful and shameless.Xiao Jinfeng could not explain so he was expelled from the Xiao family.\u201cSecond Brother, come back with me. Jingting asked me to pick you up. As to your poisoning, when we meet with Jingting, we can figure a way out, all right?\u201d Xu Muan said and secretly thought:\u00a0Xiao Jingting\u2019s current abilities were good. If he was willing to help, giving Xiao Jingting a few months\u2019 time, it shouldn\u2019t be too difficult for him to collect a thousand taels of silve.Xiao Jingfeng shook his head and said, \u201cI understand Xiao Jingting\u2019s temperament, he can\u2019t even manage his own life, how will he care about me? You must have a hard time living with him, even if my brother had some conscience to shelter me for the sake of the brotherhood, I will only drag you down now.\u201d\u201cSecond Brother, don\u2019t underestimate yourself and lose heart just because you are wronged by others. If you\u2019re cured of this poisonous wound, then you\u2019ll be an expert again.\u201d Xu Muan said.When he was in the Xiao family, Xu Muan actually admired Xiao Jinfeng. Although Xiao Jinfeng was born into a powerful family, he didn\u2019t have the pompous air of a young master and joined the mercenary team early to become self-sufficient. Seeing that arrogant Xiao Jinfeng had become like this now, Xu Muan felt sorry for him.Xiao Jinfeng smiled bitterly, this poisonous injury of his hadn\u2019t been treated timely, so he was afraid it would be hard to heal now.\u201cBrother Jinfeng, just listen to Xu Muan. Go find your brother first, or at least find a place to settle down. Brother Xu came all the way here out of good intentions. Don\u2019t let him down!\u201d Mu Shuyu was silent for a long time as he faced Xiao JinfengXiao Jinfeng looked at Mu Shuyu for a second and smiled bitterly. A few months ago, he was the young master of the Xiao family and a small captain of the mercenary team, with friends all over the world. But now he had become a street rat, all of those old friends dodged him faster than others. It was Mu Shuyu, who had always been indifferent to him, who took care of him since his downfall. It was true that you could only know your true friends when you were in need!\u201cYes! Second brother, Xiao Jingting is really different from before. When he heard that you were injured, he even gave me all the silver in the family before I left so that I wouldn\u2019t need to be stingy in buying medicine for you.\u201d Xu Muan said.Mu Shuyu looked at Xiao Jinfeng and said again, \u201cBrother Jinfeng, your brother has good intentions, just go with him. After all you are still his brother and share the same blood.\u201dXiao Jinfeng nodded and said, \u201cAll right.\u201d After the accident, Xiao Jingfeng contacted his eldest brother Xiao Qingyan, who was studying at Bifeng Academy. Unfortunately, Xiao Qingyan was probably busy with his studies and after the letter was sent, it sank in water like a stone and he didn\u2019t hear from him again.\u201cAfter meeting my younger brother, if Jingting isn\u2019t happy to see me, don\u2019t force him.\u201d Xiao Jinfeng said with some regret.Xu Muan looked at Xiao Jinfeng and said, \u201cSecond brother, Jingting has really changed a lot. You haven\u2019t seen him. No matter what I say, you won\u2019t understand. When you see him, you will know.\u201dXiao Jinfeng nodded lightly and said, \u201cAll right.\u201dMu Shuyu knew that Xiao Jinfeng didn\u2019t hold much hope for his younger brother from his disheartened tone, \u201cJinfeng, don\u2019t be discouraged! Things will eventually sort themselves out.\u201dXiao Jinfeng looked at Mu Shuyu with a wry smile and thought secretly:\u00a0Mu Shuyu was so simple that he was expecting something from that brother of his, little did he know that the greater the hope, the greater the disappointment.When Xu Muan brought Xiao Jingfeng and Mu Shuyu back to the courtyard of the Xiao family in Mound Village, Xiao Jingting was bathing Xiao Xiaofan in the courtyard.Xiao Xiaofan was sitting naked in a large wooden basin and Xiao Jingting was holding a big ladle to give him a bath. Xiao Xiaofan was full of excitement as he played in the water. Xiao Xiaodong kept a straight face as he looked at this \u201cdisgraceful\u201d scene with an unhappy face.Xiao Jingting quickly wrapped Xiao Xiaofan in a towel and asked Xiao Xiaodong to take Xiao Xiaofan in to get dressed.Xiao Xiaofan intentionally kicked him with his slippers and reluctantly followed Xiao Xiaodong into the house.Xiao Jinfeng looked at the two small kids leaving, slightly stunned in his heart. In Xiao Jinfeng\u2019s impression, Xiao Jingting had never been nice to his little sons but just now he saw the happy scene between father and son.Xiao Xiaofan entered the room and rolled around in bed, avoiding Xiao Xiaodong\u2019s hands.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201cI won\u2019t wear it. I won\u2019t wear it.\u201d\u201cYou are not ashamed to be naked and you are not ashamed to take a bath in broad daylight.\u201d Xiao Xiaodong\u2019s tone was full of frustration.\u201cNo, I\u2019m not afraid. Father says I\u2019m still young, it doesn\u2019t matter. Brother, you should also ask father to help you bathe ah! Father\u2019s bath is very comfortable.\u201d Xiao Xiaofan rubbed his feet and said.Xiao Xiaodong blushed and said, \u201cI will wash by myself.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Xiao Xiaofan lay on the bed and crawled around. Xiao Xiaodong couldn\u2019t help but feel a little jealous as he looked at Xiao Xiaofan\u2019s lazy appearance.The atmosphere was a bit tense as the brothers met in the courtyard.\u201cSecond brother, let\u2019s go into the house first.\u201d Xiao Jingting was a little embarrassed.Xiao Jinfeng nodded, and after the two brothers exchanged pleasantries for a while, Xiao Jingting settled Xiao Jinfeng in his room. Then he looked for Xiao Xiaodong and Xiao Xiaofan as he gave Xiao Jinfeng and Mu Shuyu a lot of food.Seeing that Xiao Jinfeng was a bit tired, Xiao Jingting did not ask any more questions and directly urged Xiao Jinfeng to rest.\u201cDidn\u2019t you go to pick up the second brother? How did you come back with two people? \u201d Xiao Jingting asked in puzzlement.\u201cMu Shuyu saved your second brother and he has been the one taking care of your second brother all this time.\u201d Xu Muan explained.Xiao Jingting rolled his eyes and thought in his heart:\u00a0There is a saying on the earth that if you wanted to repay your lifesaver, just marry him. Something must be going on between them!\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d Xu Muan looked at Xiao Jingting\u2019s pensive appearance and asked.\u201cI was thinking that there are only three rooms in the house. I was going to give up my room to second brother and squeeze in with you and two children, but now there is an extra person.\u201d Xiao Jingting was a bit embarrassed.Xu Muan couldn\u2019t help but blush a little when he heard Xiao Jingting wanted to squeeze into a room with him and the children. Although he and Xiao Jingting were husband and wife, and even had two children, their relationship was very rigid. He only had sex with Xiao Jingting twice, and both times when Xiao Jingting was drunk.\u201cThat Mu Shuyu is a Ger! It doesn\u2019t seem to be a good idea to let him share a room with second brother!\u201d Xiao Jingting said.Xu Muan blushed and said, \u201cActually, when I found second brother, he was already living with Mu Shuyu.\u201dXiao Jingting nodded and said, \u201cIs that so? Then it is okay for them to share the same room.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s going on with the second brother, anyway? When I saw that second brother\u2019s state isn\u2019t very good, I didn\u2019t ask for details.\u201d Xiao Jingting said.Xu Muan said, \u201cYour second brother\u2019s mercenary team spent a lot of effort to kill a fifth level demonic beast but Zhou Kangqi came over to pick it up saying he was the one who saw it first and wanted the mercenary team to give it to him. The demonic beast was hunted by the mercenary team with great efforts so naturally it was impossible for them to give it up. The two sides got into a fight, your second brother got impatient and beat Zhou Kanqi but got seriously injured.\u201d\u201cThe two sides parted unhappily. After Zhou Kangqi was injured, he held a grudge against your brother and found someone to poison him. Your brother was already injured and then poisoned, so his strength is not as good as before.\u201d\u201cAt this time, the Zhou family first put pressure on the mercenary team, making them expel your brother. When the mercenary team saw that your brother had no backing and could not compete with the strength of the Zhou family, they lied that your brother robbed the prey of young master Zhou and expelled your brother from the mercenary team.\u201d\u201cShameless!\u201d Xiao Jingting angrily said.Xu Muan shook his head and said, \u201cThe mercenary team was unanimous so your brother wouldn\u2019t be able to explain even if he had a thousand mouths! Besides, your second brother was never a person who was good with words.\u201dXiao Jingting gave a cold smile. It was because the original body owner\u2019s parents were no longer here so they lost their power. If the parents of the original body owner were still there, the mercenary team would still try to curry favor and would not let Xiao Jinfeng be framed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Is there any grudge between them?\u201d Xiao Jingting asked.\u201cYour second brother was originally engaged to Sun Miaoyin. I heard that Zhou Kanqi\u2019s brother Zhou Kanghe and Sun Miaoyin had a good relationship.\u201d Xu Muan said.Xiao Jingting squinted his eyes. Xiao Jingting had seen Sun Miaoyin before. She was a dignified and noble looking woman, based on the original body owner\u2019s memories. Although Xiao Jingfeng\u2019s qualification was good, Sun Miaoyin didn\u2019t have much of a crush on Xiao Jingfeng who didn\u2019t have the wood attribute.In the past, when the original body owner\u2019s parents were still around, Sun Miaoyin might have reluctantly married Xiao Jingfeng. However, now that nobody knew if the original body owner\u2019s parents were alive or not, Sun Miaoyin would naturally no longer spare any thought to Xiao Jingfeng whom she originally despised.\u201cAfter your brother was reported to have had an affair with Feng Xue\u2019er, the Sun family broke off your brother\u2019s engagement to Sun Miaoyin. I also think that the Sun family might have gotten involved with the matter between your brother and Feng Xue\u2019er.\u201d Xu Muan said.\u201cWhen the tree falls, the monkeys scatter; (a Chinese saying, meaning: loss of a supporter; members run away when the family or situation falls) when a wall is about to collapse, everybody gives it a push! (a Chinese saying, meaning: Everyone hits a person who is down)\u201d Xiao Jingting said.Xu Muan lowered his head and thought secretly:\u00a0Yes!\u201cBy the way, you said you need Bixin pill to detoxify the poison in second brother, and it costs 1,000 taels of silver?\u201d Xiao Jingting asked.Xu Muan nodded somewhat hesitantly, \u201cYes! If the Xiao family were to buy it, a thousand taels of silver would be enough. However, if we were to buy it, I am afraid we have to pull some strings and it will be more expensive.\u201d The smaller the place, the more expensive this kind of high-end stuff was.Xiao Jingting nodded his head and said, \u201cNo matter what, let\u2019s collect some silver first, shall we?\u201d\u201cI think the grapes in the yard are ripe. If you sell them, you should be able to make some profit.\u201d Xu Muan said.Xiao Jingting nodded and said, \u201cYes, but I don\u2019t want to lower the price, so I have already agreed with the owner of the Yuehe restaurant to sell it all to him. The owner also said that the price could be a little higher.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Xu Muan couldn\u2019t help but feel a little strange: \u201cAren\u2019t there many big families in the village who have started growing grapes? Won\u2019t the boss lose money by raising the price at this time?\u201dXiao Jingting shook his head and said, \u201cNo, the boss said it can be sold. Even if he can\u2019t sell it himself, he can still sell it to other places.\u201d How could the grapes he grew with the Spirit Spring water be the same as those grown by the landlords?\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d Xu Muan said.\u201cBy the way, the first batch of wine I made earlier is ready to drink.\u201d When making the wine, Xiao Jingting added a lot of spiritual spring water to it, and the wine contained a lot of aura. \u201cI have already prepared two jars of wine for sale to the owner of Yuehe Restaurant, and one jar can be sold for a hundred taels of silver.\u201dXu Muan was a little surprised, \u201cIt can be sold for that much?\u201dXiao Jingting nodded and said, \u201cYes!\u201d Actually, a hundred silver isn\u2019t even so expensive. This spiritual wine could improve spiritual power. Moreover, in the midst of battle, when spiritual energy was depleted, a sip of spirit wine could restore 30% of one\u2019s spiritual energy, the effect was much better than two Qi recovery pills.\u201d\u201cIf we calculate like this, it shouldn\u2019t take long before we get 1,000 taels of silver.\u201d Xu Muan said.Xiao Jingting nodded and said, \u201cYes, originally, I was thinking that when I have the silver, I would buy a demonic beast that could fly and help with cultivation. However, it is more urgent to get enough silver to buy an antidote for Second Brother first.\u201dXu Muan nodded and said, \u201cYes!\u201d\u201cI remember that second brother likes to drink a lot, so you should take a jar of wine to him later.\u201d Xiao Jingting said.According to Xiao Jingting\u2019s knowledge, being poisoned by colorful spiders was very tormenting. If he got drunk, he should feel better. The wine he brewed had a strong aura that should have a certain suppressive effect on the poison.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Xu Muan nodded and said, \u201cYes!\u201d\u201cBy the way, did you try contacting our eldest brother after the accident with second brother?\u201d Xiao Jingting asked.In the original body owner\u2019s memories, Xiao Jingting\u2019s big brother was a very capable person. The original body owner was very respectful to his eldest brother on the surface but hated him very much in heart, thinking that his parents were partial. He had the same attributes as his big brother Xiao Qingyan, yet his parents spent most of their family\u2019s money on his eldest brother.The original body owner thought if his parents spent the same amount of effort on him, he would have been a rank 4 Qi Practitioner already. There would be no reason for him to still be overpowered by his second oldest brother who only had some useless attributes.\u201cYes, but it may be because of the heavy task of the Academy that I failed to contact him.\u201d Xu Muan said.Xiao Jingting\u2019s heart flashed with a few sneers. Was it because his eldest brother was too busy, or was he just wouldn\u2019t bother to get in touch?!Even though the rules of the Bifeng Academy were strict, it didn\u2019t mean one couldn\u2019t even send out a letter.Mu Shuyu took a jar of wine and walked in the room, saying, \u201cJinfeng, this is from your brother, he made it himself. He knows that you love to drink, so he specially asked me to bring it to you.\u201dXiao Jingfeng looked at the wine in Mu Shuyu\u2019s hand and said, \u201cJingting is considerate.\u201dAs Xiao Jinfeng looked at the wine in Mu Shuyu\u2019s hand, he only felt that this jar of wine became more precious. Back then when his situation was still good, he invited the whole mercenary team to drink. But now that he was down, those people, one by one, said that he had a poor character and acted as if they did not recognize him.\u201cBrother Jingfeng, relax. Xu Muan told me that when they got enough silver, they will buy an antidote for you.\u201d Mu Shuyu comforted him.Xiao Jinfeng nodded and said, \u201cI know.\u201dXiao Jinfeng opened the wine jar and took a sip of wine, his mind full of various thoughts. When his parents were alive, they valued the eldest brother, Xiao Qingyan, the most and were proud of him in every way.When he was a teenager, Xiao Qingyan was sent by his parents to Bifeng Academy at a heavy price. The Bifeng Academy was full of aura and was a holy land for cultivation. The graduates of Bifeng Academy were at last sixth level Qi Practitioners.His parents often praised Xiao Qingyan in front of Xiao Jinfeng, for being successful, saying that he only needed to be half as successful as Xiao Qingyan, his older brother.Xiao Jinfeng always thought that if one day he was in trouble, his promising elder brother, Xiao Qingyan, would give him a hand. But he never thought that when he was really in trouble, the only person he could count on was his younger brother who was uneducated and only made troubles all day long.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He also drove the two boys to sleep in the smaller bed while he and Xu Muan slept in the bigger bed. Fearing that Xiao Xiaofan would not sleep nicely and roll down, Xiao Jingting bought a bed with guardrails.Although he already had two sons, Xiao Jingting was still a little shy about sharing a bed with Xu Muan.Xiao Jingting was shy and Xu Muan was also a little nervous, so the two of them lay on the bed a little stiffly. Xiao Xiaofan was sleeping, the house was quiet but the sound of Xiao Xiaofan turning over and grinding his teeth could still be heard clearly by Xiao Jingting.Xiao Jingting stretched out his hand and grabbed Xu Muan\u2019s hand, Xu Muan trembled slightly but didn\u2019t move, allowing Xiao Jingting to grab it.Xiao Jingting found it interesting and grasped Xu Muan\u2019s hand tighter.Worried about his thoughtful eldest son, Xiao Jingting did not dare to do anything more.\u201cWill second elder brother sleep well?\u201d Xiao Jingting asked.Xu Muan hesitated before saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dMu Shuyu and Xiao Jinfeng lay on the same bed. Mu Shuyu was supposed to sleep on the floor but of course Xiao Jinfeng could not let Mu Shuyu, who was a Ger sleep on the floor. The two of them argued before finally sleeping on the same bed.The next day.Mu Shuyu stayed in the courtyard helping Xu Muan pick grapes, \u201cMr. Xu! The grapes you are growing are very good. \u201dXu Muan nodded with pride and said, \u201cYes. Brother Shuyu, don\u2019t call me Mr. Xu anymore, just call me Muan.\u201d\u201cOkay. Muan. It seems your husband has already reached the fourth level of Qi cultivation.\u201dXu Muan nodded and said, \u201cYes!\u201d Xu Muan was a little suspicious. When he left, Xiao Jingting hadn\u2019t\u00a0advanced yet. He heard from Xiaodong that Xiao Jingting advanced not long after he left but he did not know how Xiao Jingting managed to do that.Mu Shuyu shook his head and said, \u201cBrother Jinfeng always said that this younger brother of his was a slacker, but he was wrong.\u201d\u201cNot really. He\u2019s changed a lot recently.\u201d Xu Muan said.Mu Shuyu withdrew his gaze and didn\u2019t ask too many questions. After picking the grapes, the two of them worked together to deliver the grapes to the Yuehe Restaurant.\u201cXu Muan, you are back!\u201d Zhou Ji, the owner of the restaurant, seeing Xu Muan, spoke warmly.Xu Muan nodded and said, \u201cYes! Boss Zhou, your business is getting bigger and bigger!\u201d Xu Muan found out that Zhou Ji\u2019s restaurant expanded by half. With people coming and going, his business was flourishing.\u201cIt\u2019s all thanks to your husband. Did you bring the grapes?\u201d Zhou Ji asked.Ever since Xiao Jingting\u2019s grapes started to sell well, several families had followed Xiao Jingting\u2019s example and started growing grapes, however the taste of grapes they grew was not good. Some of them tasted okay, but the aura contained in them was far from the ones grown by Xiao Jingting.Several families who had originally canceled orders from Xiao Jingting regretted it after discovering that the quality of the grapes was different and wanted to renew the contract with Xiao Jingting. However, Xiao Jingting was stubborn and didn\u2019t pay any attention to them. Boss Zhou Ji saw that the quality of the grapes was very good and it sold well, so he didn\u2019t take advantage of Xiao Jingting and took the initiative to raise the price to two hundred and fifty copper coins for a string of grapes.\u201cBoss Zhou, can you sell so many grapes?\u201d Xu Muan asked.Zhou Ji nodded and said, \u201cYes, I can sell all of them.\u201d Sales of fresh grapes were limited in the end, so Xiao Jingting taught Zhou Ji how to make grape drinks. These drinks made from that grape were very popular and many rich ladies and gentlemen were willing to spend a lot of money to buy them.Xu Muan\u2019s eyes widened and there was a bit of consternation in his heart.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201cBy the way, do you have any wine?\u201d Zhou Ji asked.Xu Muan nodded and said, \u201cI have brought some jars over.\u201dThere were a total of thirteen jars of wine. Two jars were sold and three jars were drunk. In order to earn enough money as soon as possible, Xiao Jingting decided to sell another five jars.Wine sold well and Xiao Jingting\u2019s wine was sold by jars. After Zhou Ji bought it, he changed it into porcelain bottles. A jar of wine could almost fill ten porcelain bottles. This wine had a strong, pure aura and the 20 small bottles that came out last time were sold at once.\u201cHere are eight hundred taels of silver, keep it.\u201d Zhou Ji very readily took out the bank note.Xu Muan who received the bank note, only felt like he had received a hot potato.Mu Shuyu looked at Xu Muan and asked, \u201cShall we go back now?\u201dXu Muan hesitated before saying, \u201cJingting said if it was still early after we sold the grapes, we should find out where the detoxification pills are sold.\u201dHearing Xu Muan\u2019s words, Mu Shuyu immediately calmed down a bit. Mu Shuyu vaguely heard that Xiao Jingting and Xiao Jinfeng were at odds with each other so he was very worried that Xiao Jingting would not be willing to save Xiao Jinfeng.\u201cIs there any big shop in this town?\u201d Mu Shuyu asked.Xu Muan shook his head and said, \u201cNo, but Qingcheng city is nearby, there should be one there. Let\u2019s first go to the pill shop here and ask around. If there isn\u2019t one, we\u2019ll have to take a trip to Qingcheng.\u201dMu Shuyu nodded and said, \u201cAll right!\u201dXiao Jinfeng followed Xiao Jingting to the fields. Now that Xiao Jingting was an inspirational model for Mound village, people were very curious when they saw another person beside Xiao Jingting.When Xiao Jingting was busy and Xiao Jinfeng was left alone, villagers came up to inquire about the background of Xiao Jinfeng.In the end, Xiao Jinfeng was a person from a big family and he answered their questions in a smart way and got to know many things about Xiao Jingting in return.Xiao Jinfeng had asked many people and learned that when Xiao Jingting first came, he was really fooling around, eating and drinking heavily, gambling and whoring. Then, somehow he became enlightened and began to work hard. Xiao Jinfeng was using his spirit technique to stimulate the growth of spiritual plants in the ground. Looking at the lush spiritual plants in the field, Xiao Jinfeng secretly thought:\u00a0this brother of his really became different.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

When I got busy, I forgot about you.\u201dXiao Jinfeng smiled at Xiao Jingting and said, \u201cIt\u2019s fine, if father and mother were still here, they would be very happy to know that you become so motivated.\u201dXiao Jingting smiled sheepishly.\u201cMany people were watching you just now when you were casting your spirit technique on the field.\u201d Xiao Jinfeng said.Xiao Jingting was a little surprised, \u201cWere they?\u201d\u201cYes! Many of them\u00a0were young boys and girls, and they all looked like they liked you. Third Brother, you are now the ideal partner in many people\u2019s eyes,\u201d Xiao Jinfeng said.Xiao Jingting shook his head and said, \u201cSecond brother, you just love to make fun of me.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d Xiao Jinfeng said.\u201cI have a wife and children. Now I just want to make money to support my family and I don\u2019t dare to think about anything beside that.\u201d Xiao Jingting faintly said.Hearing Xiao Jingting\u2019s words, Xiao Jinfeng breathed a sigh of relief.\u201cSecond brother, if you have something to say, just say it. I see that you have been waiting to say something to me.\u201d Xiao Jingting was confused.Xiao Jinfeng hesitated for a moment and said frankly, \u201cSun Miaomiao is going to marry Xiao Muhong.\u201dXiao Jingting was stunned for a moment. When he thought of Sun Miaomiao, he couldn\u2019t help blushing. The original body owner claimed to be a faithful fan of Sun Miaomiao, tagging along as soon as he saw her on the street and he fought with people for the sake of Sun Miaomiao. He would also keep sending gifts and other things to her, even when they were returned, he was still happy.Xiao Jingting felt ashamed when he thought of the\u00a0wretched\u00a0appearance of the original body owner.Although those things were done by the original body owner, Xiao Jingting was now integrated with the original body owner and there was always this feeling that he had done these absurd things himself.\u201cIs that so? Sun Miaomiao is going to marry Xiao Muhong? That son of a bitch Xiao Muhong will really suffer. She is a very fierce woman.\u201d Jingting shook his head as he thought,\u00a0it was really difficult for him to understand the taste of the original body owner. Based on the memory, the original body owner even let Sun Miaomiao whip him. It could be said that the original body owner was a masochism.Xiao Jinfeng was a bit surprised and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t mind?\u201d Xiao Jinfeng could still remember how Xiao Jingting served Sun Miaomiao wholeheartedly, as if he cared nothing but her, which made Xiao Jinfeng want to slap him.\u201cWhy should I mind? Sun Miaomiao is not my wife.\u201d Xiao Jingting\u00a0coolly said, the original body owner was so thick-skinned! Miss Sun obviously didn\u2019t take the original body owner seriously, but this guy didn\u2019t take it seriously at all. He was really a fool, no wonder those people looked down on him.\u201cIt\u2019s good that you don\u2019t mind.\u201d\u201cLove cannot be forced. It\u2019s just strange that this proud Miss Sun will fall for Xiao Muhong,\u201d Xiao Jingting said.\u201cNot so surprising! After father\u2019s and mother\u2019s accident, it is eldest uncle\u2019s family that is now in charge, and Xiao Muhong is eldest uncle\u2019s eldest son\u2026\u201dXiao Jingting raised his eyebrows. It was right. The situation in the Xiao family had changed and now Xiao Muhong was the most favored. It\u2019s just that the other houses aren\u2019t easy to mess with, so Xiao Muhong\u2019s position was very unstable.\u201d\u201cBy the way, these fields of yours were given to you by great aunt?\u201d Xiao Jinfeng asked with a deep frown.Xiao Jingting nodded and said, \u201cYes!\u201d\u201cI see that you only have a dozen mus of fields in total, but you still got several mus of first-class fields. \u201dXiao Jinfeng furrowed his brows.\u201cThat\u2019s right. My strength is limited so I could only plant some ordinary plants. It was a waste for this first-class field to be in my hand.\u201d Xiao Jingting has some regrets.\u201cI heard that your field has been abandoned before?\u201d Xiao Jinfeng continued to ask.Xiao Jingting nodded his head and said, \u201cYes!\u201d\u201cDo you know that this area of Mound Village is under the jurisdiction of the Marquis of Yongcheng, who issued a regulation four months ago. If a mu of first-class field is left unused for one month, you need to pay a fine of one hundred taels of silver. You have five mus of first-class fields, how many months have those fields been out of use?\u201d Xiao Jinfeng asked.Xiao Jingting\u2019s eyes widened. What the hell! A total of five mus of first-class land had been left idle for about two months, even before the original body owner came over.\u201cSecond brother, why is the fine so high!\u201d Xiao Jingting was puzzled.\u201cThe resources of the first-class fields are limited. Afraid that some landlords will occupy the fields and not do anything, the Marquis issued this decree. Although the first-class fields are used to plant fifth and sixth grade spirit plants in order to make the best use of them, it doesn\u2019t take much effort to plant some third-class spiritual plants and they can usually grow well. It is too wasteful to desert such a good field.\u201d\u201cSecond Brother, where did you get this information? No one in the village told me this,\u201d Xiao Jingting said.\u201cUsually, people won\u2019t let the first-class fields be undevelopped, so not many people know about this decree. In fact, some remote villages won\u2019t be monitored even if they left their fields barren but if I\u2019m not wrong, your field will definitely be under surveillance,\u201d Xiao Jinfeng said.Xiao Jingting was completely stunned. He originally thought it was strange why the Xiao family would give so many first-class fields to Xiao Jingting. It turned out that they were waiting for him getting punished. Yes, maybe some people could leave it barren but there would definitely be someone who investigate it if he left it barren. His eldest uncle and aunt were really calculating. Xiao Jingting really couldn\u2019t convince himself that it was just a coincidence.\u201cBefore, I pawned these fields for a while,\u201d Xiao Jingting said.\u201cThe Marquis calculates the time of desolation from the time the land deed was transferred to you, including the time when the deed was in the pawn shop,\u201d Xiao Jinfeng said.Xiao Jingting: \u201c\u2026..\u201d Then it should be two to three months, which meant he had to pay at least a thousand taels of silver.\u201cSecond brother, do you know when the marquis will come to investigate?\u201d Xiao Jingting asked.\u201cBy October,\u201d Xiao Jinfeng said.Xiao Jingting breathed a sigh of relief, fortunately, there was still time.\u201cBy then, if I don\u2019t have enough silver for the fine, what will happen?\u201d Xiao Jingting asked.\u201cJail,\u201d Xiao Jinfeng said.Xiao Jingting took a deep breath and thought:\u00a0cruel enough.\u201cSecond brother, let\u2019s go back first, we\u2019ll talk about the fields later. Anyway, there\u2019s still time to earn money. I think that Muan and Mu Shuyu should be back. This matter can wait. We should have some food first,\u201d Xiao Jingting said.When there were too many debts, one stopped worrying about them.\u00a0When Xiao Jingting listened to what Xiao Jinfeng said, he was surprised and quickly became optimistic again.Xiao Jinfeng nodded and said, \u201cGood.\u201dVisit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201cSecond brother, Muan sold five jars of wine and many grapes today. I think that we have almost enough money to buy you antidote,\u201d Xiao Jingting said.Hearing Xiao Jingting\u2019s words, Xiao Jinfeng felt warm in heart.Xiao Jingting turned his head, looked at Xiao Jinfeng\u2019s face and said, \u201cSecond brother, how can you look at me like this?\u201d\u201cI just never thought that you would do this for me.\u201d Xiao Jinfeng said.Xiao Jingting smiled peacefully and said, \u201cSecond brother, we are brothers! If I was poisoned, you will definitely help me too, right?\u201dXiao Jinfeng nodded and said; \u201cYes!\u201d Although he wasn\u2019t close to Xiao Jingting, he wouldn\u2019t sit by and do nothing if something really happened to Xiao Jingting.\u201cSecond brother, you and Mu Shuyu are dating, right?\u201d Xiao Jingting asked.Xiao Jinfeng froze for a moment, his face slightly red.Xiao Jingting raised his eyebrows and said, \u201cSecond brother, Mu Shuyu is very good to you! He still stayed together with you under those circumstances. You should not let him down.\u201d\u201cI know, and by the way, that\u2019s a nice brew you made! One hundred taels of silver are too low. Your brother drank the wine sold at the price of one hundred and twenty taels of silver, and the taste was not as good as the one you brewed.\u201d Xiao Jinfeng eyes glowed as if he was enjoying endless aftertaste.Xiao Jingting smiled helplessly and said, \u201cAfter all, we are in a small place, if it\u2019s too expensive it won\u2019t sell, and besides, my wine doesn\u2019t have much of a reputation yet, it takes time for people to recognize it.\u201d He was also in dire need of money, so he could only sell it as soon as possible.\u201cYour spiritual wine is very good for level 3 and 4 Practitioner and it is very useful for level 3 Qi practitioners,\u201d Xiao Jinfeng said.Xiao Jinfeng\u2019s words meant that although the spiritual wine was beneficial to level four Qi Practitioner, it had little use.Xiao Jingting smiled. The spiritual spring was not omnipotent. Before, he used the spiritual water to grow grapes, but the effect for more advanced spiritual plants was not so great.After becoming level four Qi Practitioner, Xiao Jingting also found that the speed at which spiritual water restored spiritual energy was greatly reduced. If the quality of spiritual spring could not be improved, then, when he became stronger, the spiritual spring would become useless.\u201cIt\u2019s a pity that the wine was sold like this.\u201d Xiao Jinfeng was full of regret.Looking at Xiao Jinfeng\u2019s reluctant look, Xiao Jingting said, \u201cThe wine sold was the first batch and the second batch should be ready in a few days. The second batch of wine is more mellow. If second brother likes it, we should keep more.\u201dXiao Jinfeng smiled awkwardly and said, \u201cI have no\u00a0preferences. I just like what\u2019s in my cup.\u201dXiao Jingting looked at Xiao Jinfeng and asked, \u201cSecond brother, drinking can cause trouble, you haven\u2019t gotten drunk and had an accident, have you?\u201dXiao Jinfeng became a little embarrassed.Xiao Jingting looked at Xiao Jinfeng and said with some astonishment, \u201cSecond brother, you didn\u2019t really have an accident, did you?\u201dXiao Jinfeng said with some embarrassment, \u201cNo.\u201dXiao Jingting looked at the expression of Xiao Jinfeng and some doubt flashed in his heart, but this was Xiao Jinfeng\u2019s private matter, so Xiao Jingting did not keep asking.When Xiao Jingting got home, Xu Muan had already laid out the bowls and chopsticks.Xu Muan took out the silver and said, \u201cThis is the money from selling wine and grapes, a total of eight hundred taels.\u201dXiao Jingting touched his chin and said, \u201cI still have over more than a hundred taels in my hand. I am almost there!\u201d\u201cI still have some savings, about two hundred taels,\u201d Mu Shuyu hurriedly said.Xiao Jingting smiled and said, \u201cHow could I take your silver?\u201dXiao Jinfeng took out a storage bag and said, \u201cI still have 300 taels of silver in my hand. When I left the Xiao family, I was driven out of my house, and the rest of my property was left in the Xiao family.\u201d Xiao Jinfeng said with a bit of hatred flashing in his eyes.Xiao Jingting looked at Xiao Jinfeng and said, \u201cSecond brother, don\u2019t be angry, just think of it as giving up your fortune to avoid disaster.\u201d\u201cThis town is too small. We inquired and found out that they didn\u2019t sell it, but there should be one in Qingcheng.\u201d Xu Muan said.Xiao Jingting took the silver and gave it to Xiao Jinfeng, saying, \u201cSecond brother, why don\u2019t you go with Mu Shuyu?\u201dXiao Jinfeng took the silver and nodded, \u201cAll right.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Where have you been all this time?\u201d Seeing Xu Muan, Aunt Li immediately approached and asked.Xu Muan said vaguely,\u00a0\u201cWent out to pick up someone.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re just coming back so you don\u2019t know\u00a0what happened! When you were not here, these\u00a0bitchy\u00a0gold diggers\u00a0were all around your husband. Qiu Bai, who used to be so cold and indifferent to your husband, became very passionate.\u201d Aunt Li was full of sarcasm.Xu Muan lowered his head and laughed. Xiao Xiaodong told him that when he was away, many matchmakers brought people to their home, but they were all driven away by him and Xiaofan.When Xu Muan came back, he met Qiu Bai who looked at him with a face full of resentment, as if he had robbed\u00a0his husband from him.\u201cMuan! Your husband is very popular now, so you better\u00a0keep an eye on him!\u201d Aunt Li\u2019s words were sincere.Xu Muan smiled and said,\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201dQiu Bai was nothing, but Sun\u00a0Miaomiao was a thorny one.\u00a0When Sun\u00a0Miaomiao was mentioned, Xiao Jingting was indifferent,\u00a0as if he hated\u00a0to know\u00a0this woman. A person\u2019s temperament might change with the things he experienced, but to change so much at once was just too weird.Xu Muan and Xiao Jingting had slept together and the features of\u00a0Xiao Jingting\u2019s body were clear to Xu Muan. If he did not know that Xiao Jingting\u2019s body was the same one, Xu Muan would suspect that someone else was pretending to be Xiao Jingting.Xu Muan vaguely guessed that Xiao Jingting\u00a0was\u00a0possessed. However, no matter who the other party was, he was much better than the original Xiao Jingting. Since the\u00a0old Xiao Jingting\u00a0had\u00a0changed, Xu Muan only felt like he was living in paradise every day, so he did not intend to speak about it.\u201cMr.\u00a0Xu, you are so generous! What kind of person did you bring back?\u201d Aunt Li asked.Xu Muan smiled and said vaguely,\u00a0\u201cRelatives.\u201d\u201cThose two people look like they\u2019re both talented. Their strength shouldn\u2019t be low, right?\u201d Aunt Li asked.Xu Muan nodded and said,\u00a0\u201cMm\u201d. Even though Xiao Jinfeng had been poisoned and his strength had regressed quite a bit, a skinny camel was still bigger than a horse. Xiao Jinfeng\u2019s strength was still outstanding in this village.\u201cHave he got married yet?\u201d Aunt Li asked.Xu Muan,\u00a0\u201c..\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201cWhere have you been?!\u201d Xiao Jingting looked at Xu Muan and asked.\u201cWhen I went out to pour the water, I met Auntie Li and chatted for a bit.\u201d Xu Muan said.\u201cAunt Li? What did she say?\u201d\u201cShe asked what your brother\u2019s background was and whether he was married.\u201dXiao Jingting was stunned for a moment and then said,\u00a0\u201cWhat does she want to do?\u201dXu Muan laughed and said,\u00a0\u201cI guess\u00a0she wants to\u00a0be a matchmaker for your brother.\u201dVisit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Xiao Jingting asked.Xu Muan smiled and said, \u201cI said your brother is not married yet, but he\u00a0has fallen for\u00a0someone and they have a good relationship.\u201dXiao Jingting nodded and said,\u00a0\u201cThen, it\u2019s good. I see that second brother and Mu Shuyu are quite a good match. Moreover, Mu Shuyu\u2019s moral character is\u00a0good.\u201d\u201cYeah!\u201d He and Xiao Jingting were married, but there were still some\u00a0people\u00a0who came to\u00a0covet Xiao Jingting\u00a0one after another. He was afraid that those people\u00a0would still come and try to make Xiao Jinfeng their husband since Xiao Jinfeng hadn\u2019t got married.\u201cI heard from Xiaofan that Qiu Bai always came to pick grapes.\u201dXiao Jingting smiled helplessly and said,\u00a0\u201cYes! Some thick-skinned people\u00a0would come,\u00a0but there is nothing I could do about it. In fact, it\u2019s not just Qiu Bai,\u00a0but fortunately,\u00a0they haven\u2019t gone too far. \u201dIn the countryside,\u00a0as long as\u00a0it was not\u00a0way across the line, it was not uncommon to go to someone else\u2019s house to get some food. Xiao Jingting couldn\u2019t say much about it.\u00a0He had to go out during the day, leaving only two little\u00a0kids\u00a0at home, which was really too inconvenient. Recently, when he went out,\u00a0he asked the two\u00a0kids\u00a0to lock the door of the courtyard.Xu Muan nodded and said,\u00a0\u201cIn the future, when you have money, you can build the courtyard wall higher and buy two dogs to protect the courtyard.\u201dXiao Jingting nodded and said,\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought too.\u201d\u201cSecond brother is gone?\u201d Xu Muan asked.Xiao Jingting nodded and said,\u00a0\u201cYes, I was afraid he would not have enough money so I gave all of my money to my second brother and I also gave him the remaining wine. Fortunately, there are a few mus\u00a0of fields with spirit plants that are about to mature, so I can sell them for money.\u201dXu Muan nodded and said,\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d\u201cThe traps in our field have caught a lot of prey in recent days, and we picked up a lot of them. It\u2019s a pity that they were found late and the prey were taken away.\u201d Xiao Jingting shook his head and said.Xu Muan\u00a0comforted him,\u00a0\u201cNo matter what, it\u2019s good to catch the prey even if it is for nothing\u2026\u201d\u201cThe prey that came recently is getting stronger and stronger, the traps won\u2019t work.\u201d Xiao Jingting\u00a0had\u00a0some worries.Xu Muan pondered for a while, and then said,\u00a0\u201cThe spiritual plants in first-class fields will not matureuntil\u00a0a few more days\u00a0later, by then, second brother should also come back.\u201dXiao Jingting nodded and said,\u00a0\u201cYes, the situation will be better when second brother returns.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He should have\u00a0gone to meet Xiao Jingting,\u201d Xiao Muhong\u00a0said.Liu Xian laughed sarcastically, \u201cXiao Jinfeng is so sick and desperate that he actually turned to Xiao Jingting for help.\u201dXiao Muhong nodded his head and said, \u201cThat is right, what kind of person is Xiao Jingting? Xiao Jinfeng should have known better. He really is desperate.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need to kill Xiao Jinfeng now that he\u2019s like this, let them go,\u201d Liu Xian said.Xiao Muhong frowned and said, \u201cMother, Xiao Jinfeng is really vengeful, if he\u2026\u201d\u201cNo matter what he intended to do, he is only a level 4 Qi practitioner. Without the protection of his family, it will be very difficult for him to advance. He was poisoned this time and didn\u2019t get proper treatment in time, even if he recovers, he will still suffer some\u00a0sequelae. He will never become a level 5 Qi Practitioner in his life. Your second uncle and second aunt just died. At this time, if Xiao Jinfeng dies as well, it will inevitably cause suspicion.\u201dXiao Muhong nodded and said, \u201cMother, you\u2019re right.\u201d\u201cYour father is now at the crucial time of competing for the position of the head of the family. If these sons of your second uncle are not properly handled, and the other houses have something on us, we\u2019ll be in trouble.\u201d Liu Xian pointed out.\u201cI understand, mother. At present the most important thing is my father\u2019s competition for the position of family head. Xiao Jinfeng is also very capable. He is obviously a man who does not understand amorous feelings, but when he is in distress, he still has a Ger accompanying him\u2026\u201d When he was not paying attention, that Ger actually took Xiao Jinfeng away.Liu Xian narrowed her eyes and said, \u201cYour second uncle\u2019s sons won\u2019t pose any threat to us now. Xiao Jinfeng\u2019s attributes aren\u2019t good and he has been expelled from the mercenary team. Xiao Jingting is only proficient in eating, drinking, whoring and gambling. He is good for nothing. I have waited for so many years for the day of our prosperity to come.\u201d\u201cMother, don\u2019t forget, there\u2019s still Xiao Qingyan from second uncle\u2019s family. When second aunt was still alive, she was most fond of this son,\u201d Xiao Muhong said.Bifeng Academy was a holy place in many people\u2019s minds, Xiao Muhong also wanted to enter and Liu Xian has also thought about it. Unfortunately, the entrance exam of Bifeng Academy was extremely difficult. Even though Liu Xian finally won anopportunity for Xiao Muhong to take the exam, Xiao Muhong did not pass it, so Xiao Muhong had always been very jealous of Xiao Qingyan.\u201cDon\u2019t worry about him. He went so far as going after the young lady of Hou house and was beaten.\u201d Liu Xian was full of glee.Xiao Muhong was unexpectedly surprised: \u201cHe has been beaten?\u201dLiu Xian dreaded Xiao Qingyan, \u201cYes, there is a gathering of talents in Bifeng Academy. Some in their twenties are level nine Qi Practitioners already. Xiao Qingyan is somewhat talented, but when he is compared to those people, he has nothing to be proud of.\u201dXiao Muhong nodded and said, \u201cSo that\u2019s how it is.\u201d\u201cIn the past, Xiao Qingyan had the financial support of his parents and had a good life in the academy. But now that he has no backing, sooner or later, he won\u2019t be able to make it, so we should now make your third and fourth uncles our targets.\u201d Liu Xian clenched her fist. They were the eldest, but in the past, they were suppressed by the second house everywhere. Now that the second house was gone, the third and fourth house rose up in strength.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Xiao Muhong nodded and said, \u201cMother, you\u2019re right.\u201d In the past, when the second\u00a0house was there, they had a good relationship with the third and the fourth house in order to fight with the second house. But now that the second house was gone, we had become competitive with each other.\u201cThe Sun family sent a message over, planning to ask you to pick a date for you and Sun Miaomiao to settle down.\u201d Liu Xian smiled.Xiao Muhong slightly blushed, \u201cI\u2019ll follow your arrangement, mother.\u201dLiu Xian smiled with satisfaction and said, \u201cMy son is talented and good looking. No wonder that unruly girl of the Sun family has a crush on you. Unlike Xiao Jingting, who is shameless and doesn\u2019t know how his status, but still dares to pursue Miss Sun.\u201dWhen Xiao Muhong heard these words, his face showed a bit of ridicule. When he thought of Xiao Jingting\u2019s humble behavior in front of Sun Xiaomiao, he felt amused.\u201cDon\u2019t you know what Xiao Jingting is like, Mother?\u201d Xiao Muhong\u00a0said in disdain, \u201cBut, mother, when Xiao Jingting left, you gave him several mus of land, including a lot of first-class fields. You were very kind to that jerk.\u201dLiu Xian smiled and said, \u201cAlthough Xiao Jingting is a loser, your grandfather treats him quite well. If we didn\u2019t give him anything, people might talk. I gave him the land, which is the guarantee of his life. If he sold all the fields, it would be his own failure. It has nothing to do with us. Besides, these fields are not a good thing.\u201dXiao Muhong was puzzled as he said, \u201cThe fields are not good.\u201d\u201cWhen I got the land deed for these first class fields they had already been abandoned for half a month. Later, I transferred the land deeds to Xiao Jingting and he should have been procrastinating for more than a month. It is stipulated by the Marquis house that the first-class farmland can\u2019t be idle and it needs to be compensated with silver.\u201d\u201cThat idiot Xiao Jingting, definitely doesn\u2019t know that there is such a rule. When the Marquis finds it, he won\u2019t even know how he ends up in being punished. Maybe, we don\u2019t even need to wait for Marquis to find it and this loser would bring death upon himself. Without the protection of his parents, Xiao Jingting is just a loser and it would be difficult for him not to cause trouble for the family.\u201d Liu Xian covered her mouth as she smiled.\u201cMother, you\u2019re so wise.\u201d Xiao Muhong complimented.Liu Xian looked at Xiao Muhong and said, \u201cYou should have a long-term vision. Xiao Jingting has now been driven out of the Xiao family, and he can\u2019t do anything about it. Your grandfather is about to finish his close-door cultivation. You should figure out a way to please the old man.

If it wasn\u2019t for you, I would be screwed this time.\u201d In fact, the antidote was only a thousand taels of silver, but the problem was that he was expelled from the mercenary team, and there was no one who would lend him the money. Not only did his family not try to find a way out for him, but they even tripped him secretly.\u201cJinfeng, it\u2019s good that you\u2019re well now. I\u2019m in need of an extra hand here.\u201d Xiao Jingting was a little happy.\u201cIs there anything I can help you with?\u201d Xiao Jinfeng asked.\u201cThe spirit plants in my few mus of fields are starting to mature, those few mus of fields are close to the mountains and forests, so it is easy to attract demonic beasts from the mountains. Before, the level of spiritual plants I planted was lower, so it didn\u2019t matter. During this period, the spirit plants in those medium class fields are about to mature, attracting more and more monsters. I originally hired two spiritual plant masters to take care of them for me. But, recently there are more and more demonic beasts and both of them were scared away by this endless stream of monsters.\u201d Xiao Jingting said helplessly.\u201cI can help take care of it. I\u2019m also a Spirit Plant Master.\u201d Mu Shuyu hesitated as he said.Xiao Jingting nodded and said, \u201cThen I will trouble you, Mu Shouyu.\u201dMu Shuyu smiled shyly and said, \u201cMy pleasure.\u201d Mu Shuyu swept the person next to him with the corner of his eyes and quickly withdrew his gaze.Xiao Jingting nudged Xiao Jinfeng and said, \u201cSecond brother, you\u2019re so charming. You\u2019ve abducted a pharmacist and Spirit Plant Master to come back with you.\u201dMu Shuyu was versed in medical skills. After Xiao Jinfeng got poisoned, if it were not for Mu Shuyu performing emergency medical care on him and always carefully using medicine to slow down Xiao Jinfeng\u2019s poisoning, Xiao Jinfeng would not have been able to last that long.When Mu Shuyu heard Xiao Jingting and Xiao Jinfeng whispering, his face turned red. Mu Shuyu lowered his head and stood in the courtyard at a loss.\u201cAlright, alright, everyone, don\u2019t just stand in the courtyard, let\u2019s eat first.\u201d Xu Muan timely rescued Mu Shuyu from embarrassment.Xiao Jingting also reacted and said, \u201cYes, everyone must eat first and then have enough food to have the strength to work.\u201dXiao Jinfeng walked into the room and found that Xiao Xiaodong and Xiao Xiaofan had already sat down.Seeing Xiao Jinfeng coming in, Xiao Xiaodong nodded to Xiao Jinfeng and said politely, \u201cHello, second uncle, how are you?\u201dXiao Jinfeng smiled and said, \u201cIt is all right.\u201dXiao Xiaofan held his rice bowl in his hands, looking straight at the table full of food, licking his lips from time to time, Xiao Xiaodong poked Xiao Xiaofan who was about to drool, making Xiao Xiaofan immediately start panicking, \u201cI didn\u2019t steal the food!\u201dXiao Jingting heard these words and was amused: this little son of his was really\u2026.\u201cAlright, alright, let eat, eat.\u201d Xiao Jingting helplessly said.Xiao Xiaofan immediately became happy with these words.Xiao Xiaodong fiercely glared at Xiao Xiaofan, Xiao Xiaofan took a piece of meat and stuffed it into his mouth, looking at Xiao Xiaodong with an innocent look in his eyes.Xiao Jinfeng looked at Xiao Jingting and thought secretly:\u00a0Jingting has really changed a lot. Before, he always scolded Xiao Xiaofan for being a bastard, who was born out of the adultery of Xu Muan. Xiao Jingting did not want to have such a stupid son. When he was still in Xiao family, although the two children were nominally young masters, they did not have a good life. When he was back, he saw them several times, both of them were pale and thin, but now they had fair and tender complexion.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Xiao Jinfeng and others all sat down and began to eat.\u201cMuan, you really know how to cook!\u201d Xiao Jinfeng said.Xu Muan smiled and said, \u201cIt was all taught by Jingting.\u201d Xiao Jingting\u2019s cooking skill was very good, but Xiao Jingting was very busy. So when Xiao Jingting cooked, Xu Muan learned hard beside him. Although it was not as good as what Xiao Jingting made, it was already very good.\u201cThird brother, I didn\u2019t expect that you could cook.\u201d Xiao Jinfeng was surprised.Xiao Jingting nodded and said; \u201cA little, after eating a lot, I can cook it.\u201dXiao Jinfeng smiled and thought secretly:\u00a0I have also eaten a lot of good food, but when it comes to cooking, I could only roast the meat. It seemed I have underestimated my younger brother.\u201cSecond uncle, are you all right?\u201d Xiao Xiaofan asked.Xiao Jinfeng nodded and said: \u201cYeah, I\u2019m cured.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s great, if the second uncle is well, he can have a little baby for me to play with.\u201d Xiao Xiaofan was full of excitement.Xiao Jingting, \u201c\u2026.\u201d What is this stupid son of his thinking?

For a while, the attention of many people in the village shifted from Xiao Jingting to Xiao Jinfeng.\u201cThat Xiao Jinfeng is amazing. He can deal with two demonic beasts by himself.\u201d\u201cI heard that he is Xiao Jingting\u2019s elder brother and the young master of the Xiao family.\u201d\u201cThe young masters of a big family are just different. Even those who come here at random are already so strong.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not true. However, it\u2019s not surprising since these young masters of large families have been eating high rank treasures since they were little, even a pig in those big families would have become a golden pig.\u201d\u201cThat Xiao Jinfeng is nothing special. He had bad moral character, robbed people of their prey and was expelled from the mercenary team. Then after returning to the Xiao family, he raped the wife of his brother and was driven out of the house.\u201d Qiu Li held his head high, full of disdain.\u201cQiu Li, where did you hear this news?\u201dVisit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201cThat means you are still kept in the dark. This has spread all over Mocheng. I have heard from the merchants that Mound Village is not a good place for those young masters. These young masters came here because they could no longer live at their old place. Xiao Jinfeng was ungrateful and acted recklessly, so his fianc\u00e9e could not bear to watch it and broke off his engagement with him.\u201d Qiu Lo said in a smug way.Qiu Li was originally regarded as a \u201ctalented man\u201d in the village, but after Xiao Jingting corrected his bad habits, his \u201ctalent\u201d was dwarfed. After Xiao Jinfeng came, the focus of the villagers was on the two brothers of the Xiao family, making Qiu Li dissatisfied for a long time already.\u201cNo way, that young man is quite handsome.\u201d Some aunt said.\u201cYou may know a person\u2019s face but not his mind, that Xiao Jinfeng isn\u2019t a good person,\u201d Qiu Li said.\u2026.After the spiritual plants in a few mus of medium grade fields gradually matured, Xiao Jingting invited a few people from the village to help with the harvest. Originally, he was afraid of demonic beasts that might come out from time to time, making some villagers not dare to help. However, with Xiao Jinfeng watching beside, the villagers were relieved.Xiao Jingfeng\u2019s reputation of low moral character and lustfulness spread throughout the village, however, it was still necessary to make money. When Xiao Jingting offered a high price, all the villagers scrambled to help.Xiao Jinfeng took a sip of wine and spread his spiritual energy, ignoring the suspicious, inquisitive eyes of the villagers.Xiao Jinfeng knew that his bad reputation was spread everywhere in the village, but he did not really care. He had already experienced the double betrayal from his mercenary brothers and his own family, those villagers spreading some gossip were not painful to Xiao Jinfeng.Qiu Li, who originally spread the gossip about Xiao Jinfeng, felt a little smug. However, when he found out that people still ate and slept like usual and villagers still rushed to the Xiao family house to help, Qiu Li suddenly felt that he became a villain in vain.Qiu Li felt that the villagers were really unscrupulous and scolded people for being worthless behind their back, but when Xiao Jingting took a little money out, they all ran over to help.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This much of spiritual grain should be able to be sold for seven or eight hundred taels of silver.\u201d Zhao Maner next to Qiu Bai muttered with envy.\u201cXiao Jingting unexpectedly handed over such an important matter of selling grain to Xu Muan.\u201dZhao Maner was somewhat puzzled and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with handing it over to Xu Muan? My father also handed it to daddy to sell grain.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s totally wrong. How much can you sell the grain of yours for? The grain your family grows is of low grade and your father knows it. But what Xiao Jingting grows is different. He grows high grade grain; the price range is big so if Xu Muan takes one or two hundred taels of silver into his own pocket, it can go unnoticed,\u201d Qiu Bai said sourly.Zhao Maner scratched his head and said, \u201cXu Muan is not such a person.\u201dQiu Bai snorted lightly and said, \u201cWho knows, knowing one\u2019s face doesn\u2019t mean knowing one\u2019s heart.\u201dAfter selling the grain, Xu Muan got 800 taels of silver and his heart finally settled a bit.When Xu Muan came out of the grain store, a man pounced towards Xu Muan in panic, \u201cXu Muan, help me!\u201dXu Muan looked at the man who rushed to him and a fit of anger in his heart surged up. He wanted to go up and kick this man hard. Xu Muan looked at Wang Erhu and sneered, saying, \u201cHelp you? I don\u2019t even know you, why do I help you?\u201d\u201cXu Muan, I\u2019m your husband\u2019s brother. You can\u2019t watch me die and do nothing.\u201dXu Muan snorted lightly and said, \u201cWhat a joke. My husband\u2019s brother? My husband is the young master of the Xiao family. My husband\u2019s brothers are also young masters of the Xiao family. How dare a scoundrel like you pretend to be the young master of the Xiao family?\u201dA few servants came out with sticks, \u201cYes! You finally dared to show up, you punk.\u201dA few servants looked at Xu Muan with fear, as if they were worried that Xu Muan would help out: \u201cHey, how dare you claim to be one of the Xiaos? Finally there is someone who came to teach you a lesson.\u201dVisit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Xu Muan said to the several servants, who came, \u201cThis kind of person needs to learn his lessons. Better give him a hard beat.\u201dRemembering that Wang Erhu came to his house and asked Xiao Jingting to sell his sons, Xu Muan was filled with disgust for this man. If Xiao Jingting hadn\u2019t changed his temper, Wang Erhu might have succeeded.\u201cMr. Xu, I am a good friend of your husband. He is the most righteous person, he will definitely hold a grudge against you if he knows that you did not save me from death.\u201d Wang Erhu said.Xu Muan sneered, \u201cLook at yourself, will my husband hate me for such a despicable stinker like you? Don\u2019t think too much of yourself.\u201dWang Erhu\u2019s face became red as he was scolded by Xu Muan, then Xu Muan said to several servants: \u201cThis man is morally corrupt and a liar. Don\u2019t show mercy to him. Since you guys are busy, I\u2019ll leave first.\u201d\u201cThis young mister is right. Wang Erhu is not a good man. He should be taught a lesson.\u201d The leader of servants urged people to rush forward and hit Wang Erhu vigorously with the stick.Xu Muan retreated a few steps, gloating over this scene.Wang Erhu was beaten up till he was screaming at the top of his lungs, so Xu Muan didn\u2019t bother to watch anymore and turned around to leave.Wang Erhu saw that Xu Muan was about to leave, and shouted urgently, \u201cMr. Xu, don\u2019t go. I know a secret, a secret about your husband.\u201dXu Muan heart skipped a beat as he snorted lightly and said, \u201cReally? Just what can you know?\u201d\u201cSomeone wants to harm your husband, he ordered me to corrupt your husband,\u201d Wang Erhu said loudly.\u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense. My husband has always been kind to others, how could someone want to harm him. Shameless liar, cut the crap. I don\u2019t care what you\u2019re going to say.\u201d Xu Muan pulled Mu Shuyu away.Mu Shuyu who was pulled away by Xu Muan looked at Xu Muan anxiously and said, \u201cWhat he said may be true.\u201dXu Muan nodded and said, \u201cWhat he said should be true. Don\u2019t worry, these servants won\u2019t dare to kill anyone in the city. They will be sued if they kill someone openly in the city.\u201dMu Shuyu said, \u201c\u2026\u201dXu Muan pursed his lips and said indifferently: \u201cWhen Wang Erhu is given a hard beat, he will behave himself, and then we\u2019ll secretly find someone to ask about it.\u201dMu Shuyu, \u201c\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He now understood why Wang Erhu was so active in circling around the original body owner. The original body owner was so easily duped, and took such a scheming man as his friend.Xu Muan nodded and said, \u201cYes, that\u2019s what Wang Erhu said.\u201dXiao Jingfeng pulled a long face, gnashed his teeth and said, \u201cWho on earth is that nobleman?! So vicious.\u201dXiao Jingting squinted, with so many people trying hard to drag him down, and the original body owner\u2019s lack of aggressiveness, it was not surprising that the original body owner stooped so low.\u201cDid he say who it was?\u201d Xiao Jingting asked.\u201cNo, he said that his benefactor was very mysterious and didn\u2019t tell him his identity. However, he said that his benefactor had left a jade pendant for him and told him to take it to him after he completed his task.\u201d Xu Muan took out a jade pendant and gave it to Xiao Jingting.\u201cLet me have a look.\u201d Xiao Jinfeng said.Xiao Jingting heard his words and handed the jade pendant to Xiao Jinfeng. Xiao Jinfeng looked at the jade pendant and there was a surge of fury in his eyes, \u201cIt should be the jade pendant of Sun Hao from the Sun family\u2019s.\u201dXiao Jingting squinted his eyes. He originally thought that one of the Xiao family was behind this, but he didn\u2019t expect it to be someone from the Sun family.\u201cThird brother, do you have any grudge with Sun Hao?\u201d Xiao Jinfeng asked.Xiao Jingting shook his head and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know, Sun Hao always thought that I was a rat in the gutter and that I shouldn\u2019t have pursued his sister.\u201dXiao Jinfeng narrowed his eyes and said, \u201cThat Sun Miaomiao is not a good woman either. How dare he look down on you. This is just too much.\u201d\u201cAlright, just forget it,\u201d Xiao Jingting said.Xiao Jingfeng nodded and said, \u201cYes! The Sun family is in a mess. I thought Sun Hao was not too bad, but I didn\u2019t expect him to be such a person. \u201d\u201cYoung Master Sun takes care of everything every day. That matter had happened a long time ago, so I guess he wouldn\u2019t find fault with us after such a long time.\u201d Xiao Jingting was still a little worried that his former enemy would come and make trouble for him.Xiao Jinfeng snorted lightly and said, \u201cIf he dares to come, I will teach him a lesson.\u201dXiao Jingting looked at Xiao Jinfeng and said, \u201cSecond brother, calm down.\u201dXu Muan looked at Xiao Jingfeng and said, \u201cSecond brother, I heard that you showed your prowess again today.\u201dVisit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Xiao Jingfeng laughed and said, \u201cIt was just a third-level wild boar that came, nothing special.\u201d\u201cSecond brother, you\u2019re so powerful that you even don\u2019t need to pay attention to a third-level wild boar,\u201d Xu Muan complimented.Xiao Jinfeng laughed and only felt that his present days were much more interesting than before. Most of the mercenary team members came from commoner families and had an innate prejudice against nobles. He once had thought that he had integrated into the mercenary team, but in the end he only found that it was an illusion.Xu Muan lowered his head and his heart surged with uneasiness as he thought:\u00a0After Xiao Jingting advanced, his help to Xiao Jingting became much smaller, he needed to think of a way to improve his strength as soon as possible ah! Xiao Jingting\u2019s change not only comforted Xu Muan but also made him feel more uneasy.\u201cWhat happened to Wang Erhu?\u201d Xiao Jinfeng asked with a fierce expression on his face.\u201cHe is a scoundrel, always making money by blackmailing, but this time he ate his own bitter fruit. He molested a young master from a big family in the town and was seriously injured,\u201d Xu Muan said.\u201cHe deserved it.\u201d Xiao Jinfeng said.Xu Muan nodded and said, \u201cYes.\u201dWang Erhu had come to the countryside to look for Xiao Jingting once before when Xiao Jingting went out and he unfortunately encountered Xu Muan.Xu Muan said that Wang Erhu was a thief, who entered the house to take things without the consent of others. Then he led other people to beat Wang Erhu hard. Wang Erhu suffered a lot and did not dare to come to the countryside to find anyone again.Xu Muan heard that after Wang Erhu offended people this time, he intended to plot against Xiao Jinfeng. However, in order not to be found by that big family, he had been hiding and had not found a chance to leave the city.Later, Wang Erhu met Xu Muan and, not knowing if he was too desperate, he actually turned to Xu Muan for help.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

There is no need to thank me. Mu Shuyu, you helped me a lot during this period of time, so it should be me thanking you.\u201dMu Shuyu looked at Xiao Jingting and slowly said, \u201cAfter your second brother was poisoned, his strength regressed. If it was only strength retrogression, it would be nothing. Your second brother is still young, so sooner or later he would be able to get his cultivation back. But your second brother was poisoned and the poison damaged his internal organs and meridians and cut off the possibility of his further development\u2026\u201dXiao Jingting was stunned for a moment before he said, \u201cHow did this happen?\u201d\u201cHear me out. I thought that he would be at most a level fourth Qi Practitioner in his life, so I\u00a0didn\u2019t dare tell him. But recently, I found that your brother\u2019s internal organs and meridians are gradually being repaired. I observed for a while and\u00a0I think the spiritual wine you brewed played a role,\u201d Mu Shuyu said.Xiao Jingting, \u201c\u2026.\u201dMu Shuyu looked at Xiao Jingting and said, \u201cIf it is possible, I hope you can leave more spiritual wine for your brother.\u201dXiao Jingting nodded and said, \u201cI understand.\u201dXu Muan was coxing his two sons to sleep. Seeing Xiao Jingting enter the room, he lowered his voice and asked, \u201cWhat was Shuyu looking you for?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s for the benefit of second brother. He said that the spiritual wine I brewed is good for second brother and asked me to keep more for him,\u201d Xiao Jingting said.Xu Muan was stunned for a moment and then said, \u201cMu Shuyu is really good to your second brother.\u201dXiao Jingting nodded, saying, \u201cYes, second brother\u2019s charm is really great.\u201d Mu Shuyu had known before that his second brother\u2019s injuries would affect his future cultivation progress, yet he was still accompanying Xiao Jinfeng. It was clear that Mu Shuyuwas really good to Xiao Jinfeng!Xu Muan nodded, \u201cThen, the spiritual wine brewed this time\u2026\u201d\u201cNot for sale,\u201d Xiao Jingting said. The benefits of spiritual spring were too great. When he brewed wine this time, he infused it with more spiritual spring water and it would be bad if people who had bad intentions would notice it.\u201cOriginally, Boss Zhou Ji told me that if there was spiritual wine, we should keep two jars for him. However, now we are not short of the money to sell this wine. The spiritual energy contained in this wine is really exuberant,\u201d Xu Muan said.Xu Muan had a lighter mood now since he didn\u2019t need to worry about food and clothing. Xu Muan thought more about how to improve his strength and paid more attention to the things that could improve his strength.Xiao Jingting nodded and said, \u201cYes!\u201dXu Muan, carrying food and wine, walked in the direction of the field.\u201cMuan! Came to deliver the food?!\u201dXu Muan nodded and said, \u201cYes!\u201d\u201cMuan! Your two family members are really capable! One has extraordinary strength, and the other is a third level spiritual planter.\u201dXu Muan smiled faintly and said, \u201cYes!\u201d Mu Shuyu now helped with farming all day long, while Xiao Jinfeng helped with the inspection of the fields, so now he was the idlest one. Xu Muan was used to being busy, so he felt a little uneasy having so much free time.When Xiao Jingting saw Xu Muan, he waved his hand towards Xu Muan happily.Xiao Jingting\u2019s action made the few villagers in the field a little embarrassed. Xu Muan with a well-intentioned smile walked towards Xiao Jingting and handed the basket in his hand to Xiao Jingting.Xiao Jingting distributed the food and sat on the earth mound with Xu Muan, sharing lunch.Xiao Jingting looked at Xu Muan\u2019s attentive eyes and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Why aren\u2019t you eating? Why are you staring at me like that? Do you find your husband very charming? \u201dXu Muan rested his chin and said, \u201cYou are really popular. When you worked, many people stared at you.\u201d\u201cDid they?\u201d Xiao Jingting became a little shy when he was flirted with instead of being a flirt.\u201cOf course!\u201d Xu Muan nodded seriously. Recently, Xiao Jingting had become more and more popular in the village, \u201cBy the way, your strength seems to have increased again.\u201dXiao Jingting nodded and said, \u201cAs long as you exhaust your aura and wait for the spiritual energy in your body to fill up again, your strength will take a leap.\u201d\u201cIt is painful, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Xu Muan asked.Xiao Jingting nodded and said, \u201cIt can be a little painful, but the feeling of strength improvement is very good.\u201dXu Muan smiled and didn\u2019t reply.\u201cDaddy, you\u2019re back?\u201d Xiao Xiaodong couldn\u2019t help but be a little curious when he saw that Xu Muan returned early.Xu Muan was a little distracted, \u201cYes!\u201dThen to Xiao Xiaodong, Xu Muan said, \u201cPlay outside with your younger brother, daddy is going to the house to sleep for a while.\u201dXiao Xiaodong nodded and said, \u201cAre you very tired, daddy? Then have a good rest.\u201dXu Muan went back to the house and took out a jade box, a Lieyan Herb entered Xu Muan\u2019s eyes. Inside the jade box was a Lieyan Herb which was red all over.Ordinary Lieyan Herb bloomed for ten years, but this one had undergone a mutation and was five hundred years old and the spiritual energy contained within it was very powerful.Xu Muan\u2019s cultivation could be improved very quickly and the contribution of Lieyan Herb wasn\u2019t small. For his current cultivation, ordinary Lieyan Herb wouldn\u2019t have much effect, so if he wanted to improve, he could only use strong medicine.Xu Muan closed his eyes. He had recently faintly reached the bottleneck of the fourth level. However, reaching it didn\u2019t mean that he could cross it. How many people had been at the bottleneck of the third level of Qi training for several years? In this world, strength was respected and every time his strength improved, his status would change greatly. Xu Muan eagerly wanted to catch up with Xiao Jingting and couldn\u2019t wait any longer.At sunset, when Xiao Jingting walked towards his home, he saw a child running over.\u201cSlow down. What are you doing?\u201d Xiao Jingting looked\u00a0at Xiao Xiaodong and warmed him.Xiao Xiaodong rushed to Xiao Jingting breathlessly with a pale face and said, \u201cFather, something is wrong, something has happened to daddy.\u201dXiao Jingting picked up Xiao Xiaodong and asked, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know, daddy is screaming but he closed the door and we can\u2019t get in.\u201d Xiao Xiaodong was very anxious.Xiao Jingting didn\u2019t have time to ask any more questions and run back home with Xiao Xiaodong.Xiao Xiaofan was wandering around the door, looking overwhelmed as Xu Muan\u2019s painful screams came from inside the door.Xiao Jingting kicked the door and it opened immediately.Inside the room, Xu Muan\u2019s face was flushed with fever and his eyes were bloodshot.\u201cAre you all right, are you all right?\u201d Xiao Jingting looked at Xu Muan\u2019s distressed appearance and couldn\u2019t help feeling flustered.When Xu Muan saw Xiao Jingting, his face reddened even more as if it was about to explode.Xu Muan looked away and buried his face in the blanket, full of embarrassment.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Xiao Jingting said anxiously, \u201cMuan, talk to me! How do you feel? What happened exactly? Tell me!\u201d Xiao Jingting grabbed Xu Muan\u2019s arm that was boiling hot, \u201cMuan, you are burning! Do you have a fever!? How come you burn like this?!\u201dMu Shuyu stepped forward and took his pulse. Then his face suddenly changed.\u201cMu Shuyu, what\u2019s wrong with Muan?\u201d Xiao Jingting\u2019s voice was filled with worry as he asked Mu Shuyu.Mu Shuyu swallowed his saliva and said awkwardly, \u201cMuan, seems to have mistakenly taken a strong aphrodisiac. Just sleep with him, and he will be fine.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Xiao Jingting froze in a daze.Xu Muan curled his body, wanting to find a hole in the ground to hide.\u201cAlright, alright, we\u2019re going out.\u201d Xiao Jinfeng reacted first and took the two small children out.\u201cI want to watch over daddy.\u201d Xiao Xiaofan didn\u2019t understand what was going on, so he said loudly.\u201cDaddy doesn\u2019t need you to watch over.\u201d Xiao Xiaodong said.Xiao Jinfeng and Mu Shuyu quickly retreated.Inside the room, Xiao Jingting was at loss. He wanted to develop an intimate relationship with Xu Muan gradually. But this time, he had to do it with him under such an urgent circumstance.Xu Muan was so ashamed and embarrassed that he wanted to knock himself out.Xiao Jingting reached out and hugged Xu Muan. Under the influence of aphrodisiac, Xu Muan clinged to Xiao Jingting\u2019s body uncontrollably and let out a contented groan. With his body completely out of control, Xu Muan on one hand longed for Xiao\u00a0Jingting\u2019s embrace, and on the other hand, he was embarrassed.Xiao Jingting, who was hugged, was thrilled and quickly undid his clothes and hugged Xu Muan.Xu Muan\u2019s skin was very smooth, like fine satin and his waistline was perfect. Xiao Jingting\u2019s hands were stuck to Xu Muan\u2019s waist. It felt like he was touching a fine warm jade.Xu Muan hugged Xiao Jingting\u2019s neck and nibbled at the side of his neck for a while.Xiao Jingting who was nibbled by Xu Muan felt like his whole body was burning. Xiao Jingting felt that the person who took the aphrodisiac had become himself.Outside the door, Xiao Xiaofan listened to the sound from the inside of the door, \u201cDong, Dong, Dong, Dong, Dong, Dong\u2026\u201d anxiously scratching his ears. \u201cBrother, I\u2019m going to see how Daddy is doing.\u201dXiao Xiaodong blushed and said, \u201cDon\u2019t go.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t go.\u201d Xiao Xiaodong said firmly.Xiao Xiaofan looked at Xiao Xiaodong, full of grievances as he said, \u201cBrother, aren\u2019t you worried about daddy?\u201dXiao Xiaodong pursed his lips, worried. Of course, he was worried. However, kids were not supposed to watch such a lustful scene.Father was so nervous just now that he kicked the door so hard that it could not be closed now.Xiao Xiaofan pouted and said, \u201cI see, you\u2019re not worried about daddy at all.\u201dXiao Xiaodong glanced at Xiao Xiaofan full of disdain, secretly thinking:\u00a0My younger brother is really an idiot.Xu Muan\u2019s 'scream\u201d came from the door and Xiao Xiaofan couldn\u2019t help jumping down from his chair and running towards the door, making Xiao Xiaodong pounce on him to the ground.Xiao Xiaofan screamed while Xiao Xiaodong roared fiercely, \u201cShut up.\u201dThe noise coming from the door was getting louder and louder, so Xiao Jinfeng touched his nose, saying: \u201cShuyu, take them out to catch some fish for our dinner.\u201dWhen Mu Shuyu heard Xiao Jinfeng\u2019s words, he said with relief, \u201cOkay.\u201d Mu Shuyu, after listening to movement behind the door, was already restless, so when he heard Xiao Jinfeng\u2019s words, he breathed a sigh of relief.Mu Shuyu walked away with the two children. Xiao Xiaofan seemed to be worried about Xu Muan but he was dragged away by Xiao Xiaodong.\u201cDaddy is crying out in pain.\u201d Xiao Xiaofan said unhappily.\u201cYou heard it wrong,\u201d Xiao Xiaodong said coldly.Xiao Xiaofan said disapprovingly, \u201cI did not hear it wrong, Daddy was really crying out in pain!\u201dXiao Xiaodong said angrily, \u201cI said already! You heard it wrong.\u201d\u2026\u2026Xiao Jingting and Xu Muan had been doing it for the whole night before they fell into a deep sleep until the sun rose.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He is sleeping soundly, so I\u00a0didn\u2019t wake him up.\u201d\u201cIt is all right. Why was he on an aphrodisiac?\u201d Xiao Jinfeng asked.Xiao Jingting shook his head and scratched his head in agony before saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know! We can only wait for Xu Muan to wake up, before we ask him.\u201dXiao Xiaofan and Xiao Xiaodong came out of the room, the two of them slept in the room that Xiao Jingting gave to Xiao Jinfeng last night. Because the war was too fierce over there, Xiao Jinfeng was too embarrassed to go there and get their bed, so he let the two children sleep on his bed while he slept on the ground with Mu Shuyu.Xiao Xiaofan raised his head and looked at Xiao Jingting in confusion. Xiao Jingting waved to Xiao Xiaofan and asked, \u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201dXiao Xiaofan bit his finger, seemingly embarrassed, \u201cFather, did you bully our daddy yesterday?\u201dXiao Jingting suddenly lost his voice.\u201cMy Daddy had been crying out in pain.\u201d Xiao Xiaofan gloomily said.Xiao Jingting, \u201cYou misheard\u2026\u201dXiao Xiaofan was full of unhappy thoughts, \u201cI\u2019ve been told I heard it wrong, but I clearly heard daddy shouting!\u201dXiao Jingting, \u201c\u2026.\u201d This stupid child, it sounded as if his technique was bad.Xiao Xiaofan was full of resentment as he looked at Xiao Jingting, making Xiao Jingting feel a little guilty.\u201cWhere is daddy?\u201d Xiao Xiaofan asked.\u201cIn the room?\u201d Xiao Jingting said.\u201cI\u2019ll go see my daddy.\u201d Xiao Xiaofan said.Xiao Jingting nodded and said, \u201cOkay, but your daddy is still resting, so you should be gentle.\u201dXiao Xiaofan busily nodded his head and said, \u201cI know.\u201dXiao Xiaofan ran into the room, leaning over Xu Muan\u2019s bedside and calling, \u201cDaddy.\u201dXu Muan pretended to be asleep with his eyes closed, ignoring Xiao Xiaofan\u2019s call. In fact, Xu Muan woke up long ago, however, he still remembered how he was diagnosed with aphrodisiac yesterday and how he pestered Xiao Jingting for sex. He felt really ashamed so he simply pretended to forget about it.\u201cDaddy, are you hungry? Would you like to eat something?\u201d Xiao Xiaodong asked.Xu Muan\u2019s face flushed. His youngest son did not understand what happened last night but to his eldest son, it was transparent.\u201cRight! Daddy, what did you do yesterday? You look tired, even more tired than after you go hunting,\u201d Xiao Xiaofan said.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Xu Muan blushed and said, \u201cDaddy is very tired.\u201dMu Shuyu and Xiao Jinfeng took their two babies to the field, leaving only Xiao Jingting and Xu Muan at home.\u201cAre you awake?\u201d Xiao Jingting looked at Xu Muan and asked with a smile.Xu Muan nodded and said, \u201cYes.\u201dXiao Jingting brought a bowl of chicken soup to Xu Muan and said, \u201cI made chicken soup for you. Drink it quickly.\u201dXu Muan looked at Xiao Jingting for a long time, sighed softly and bowed his head before saying, \u201cYou\u2019re not actually Xiao Jingting, are you?\u201dXiao Jingting was stunned for a moment, then steadily placed the chicken soup on the table, but he did not refute it, \u201cHow could you tell?\u201d\u201cActually, it was easy to tell! It\u2019s just that I\u2019ve been deceiving myself. A person\u2019s nature may change gradually, but not overnight. Besides, the original Xiao Jingting didn\u2019t even know how to cook, let alone brew wine, you are too different from him\u2026\u201d The original Xiao Jingting was selfish and didn\u2019t care about anyone else\u2019s life or death except himself.Xiao Jingting looked at Xu Muan, tilted his head, smiled and asked, \u201cDo you like the original Xiao Jingting or me?\u201dXu Muan lowered his head and remained silent for a while before speaking, \u201cOf course it would be you.\u201d If Xiao Jingting had not suddenly changed, their family would be ruined and his son would be sold. Even if Xiao Jingting would not be so bad, when the fine for abandoned fields came down, they would still be dead.Xu Muan closed his eyes, no matter who this person was and what his purpose was, this person was his only salvation now.Xiao Jingting smiled, saying, \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d\u201cWho are you and how did you take over Xiao Jingting\u2019s body?\u201d Xu Muan asked.Xiao Jingting said in some confusion, \u201cTake over?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u00a0So how did you get into this body?\u201d Xu Muan asked.\u201cI don\u2019t know! I am not from your world. I drowned in my own world and when I woke up, I became Xiao Jingting. When I entered this body, the original Xiao Jingting seemed to already have been dead,\u201d Xiao Jingting said.Xu Muan looked at Xiao Jingting in some confusion and said, \u201cIs that so?\u201dXiao Jingting nodded and said, \u201cYes! I think the original Xiao Jingting died from overdosing on Happy Powder.\u201dXu Muan looked at Xiao Jingting and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know if this situation of yours counts at taking over, but you should never tell anyone about this. This world is extremely strict about managing the possession of someone else\u2019s body. Once it is found out, you will be executed.\u201dXiao Jingting nodded and said, \u201cI understand.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

But his poor technology was the reason why Xu Muan recognized he was not the original body owner.\u201cI like men, I don\u2019t like women. In my world when men and men get together, there will be criticism, so I\u2019ve been single,\u201d Xiao Jingting explained.Xu Muan couldn\u2019t help looking at Xiao Jingting strangely, \u201cYour world is like this?\u201dXiao Jingting nodded and said, \u201cYes!\u201d\u201cHow about Gers?\u201d Xu Muan asked.Xiao Jingting shook his head and said, \u201cThere are no Gers in our world.\u201dXu Muan was full of amazement. Xiao Jingting looked at Xu Muan and suddenly felt relieved. It was actually a very difficult thing to keep a secret alone. Xiao Jingting felt much more relaxed after finally speaking it out.\u201cWhy did you suddenly take an aphrodisiac?\u201d Xiao Jingting asked.\u201cThere is a spiritual plant called Lieyan Herb, which has the effect of aphrodisiacs. I accidentally ate one by mistake and found out that it could boost my spiritual power. Therefore, I have been taking it to improve my strength. There had been no problem before but this time I took a mutated one and something happened,\u201d Xu Muan said.Xiao Jingting frowned and said, \u201cDoes this kind of Lieyan Herb have any side effects?\u201d\u201cIt will damage the meridians.\u201dXiao Jingting\u2019s face darkened as he said, \u201cWith such great side effects, you still dared to take it?\u201dWith a smile, Xu Muan said, \u201cThe meridians can be slowly healed. After they are healed, they will also widen a little. Your spiritual wine can also repair the meridians.\u201dXiao Jingting rolled his eyes as he said, \u201cNo matter what, you should not take this kind of spiritual herb again in future.\u201dXu Muan nodded and said, \u201cI know! I have advanced to the fourth level of Qi practice already and Lieyan Herb doesn\u2019t have much use to me anymore.\u201dXiao Jingting, \u201c\u2026\u201dXiao Jinfeng and Mu Shuyu returned home with two children.Xiao Jinfeng looked at Xiao Jingting and said sadly, \u201cLast night, the field was invaded by demonic beasts, and many of the spirit plants in the fields were eaten.\u201dXiao Jingting, \u201c\u2026\u201d Secretly sighed softly in his heart.\u00a0Something really did happen after all! Although he had tried his best to adjust the maturity of spiritual plants to daytime, and Xiao Jinfeng had also stepped in to take care of some of the demonic beasts near the fields, he still couldn\u2019t stop these demonic beasts.\u201cForget the money we lost. Is the damage large?\u201d Xiao Jingting asked.\u201cAbout half of it was lost, but a few second level beasts fell into the trap,\u201d Xiao Jinfeng said.Xiao Jingting touched his chin and said to himself, \u201cIt seems we need to increase the strength of the traps.\u201d The original traps were not enough. \u201cGreat Aunt giving me those few mus of fields on purpose.\u201dMu Shuyu nodded and said, \u201cYes, that vicious woman obviously wanted to make you suffer through the hands of another.\u201d Because Xiao Jinfeng\u2019s reputation was destroyed by Lu Xian\u2019s plot, Mu Shuyu also hated her.Xiao Jingting shook his head, sighed and said, \u201cAll right I will go to the field and see how much loss I can recover.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll go too,\u201d Xu Muan said.Mu Shuyu looked at Xu Muan and said in some surprise, \u201cMuan, you have advanced to the fourth level of Qi Practice!\u201dXu Maan nodded and said, \u201cYes!\u201dMu Shuyu was filled with confusion, \u201cHow did you get promoted? Could it be that?\u201d\u00a0Just do it?Xiao Jingting looked at Mu Shuyu\u2019s confused look and told him about the Lieyan Herb.\u201cMuan, you took too much risk.\u201d Xiao Jinfeng frowned.Xu Muan nodded and said, \u201cI know, I won\u2019t do it in the future.\u201dThe havoc caused by demonic beasts made Xiao Jingting lose a lot of money, and so many people in the village expressed their \u2018deep sympathy for Xiao Jingting\u2019s loss.Xiao Jingting cleaned up the fields, this time two mus of high-grade fields were seriously damaged. He had in total five mus of high-grade fields and he purposely staggered the maturing time of the spiritual plants between the fields so this three mus of fields were still fine.\u201cMaster Xiao, those demonic beasts are too hateful.\u201dVisit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201cYes! Master Xiao, if you sold these spiritual plants that are damaged, you would have no problem to sell them for five or six hundred taels.\u201d\u201cMaster Xiao, sorry for your loss. Losing some spiritual plants is alright as long as none of you are hurt.\u201d\u201cMaster Xiao, yours fields are fertile, but the location isn\u2019t good enough!\u201d\u2026\u2026Xiao Jingting who faced the villagers who were chattering, became speechless.Qiu Li stood in the distance, looking at the fields that had been ravaged by the demonic beasts and couldn\u2019t help but gloat a little, \u201cSo what if you\u2019re good at farming, it will be all for naught when the demonic beasts come again.\u201d\u201cThat is right, when these demonic beasts come, all money spent on seeds and labor cost will be lost.\u201dSeveral villagers gloated behind Xiao Jingting\u2019s back. Qiu Li looked at the fallen spiritual plants and secretly believed the demonic beasts were merciful for leaving Xiao Jingting a few mus of untouched land.The villagers were jealous of Xiao Jingting\u2019s good land and of the silver he earned.Xiao Jingting calmly cleaned up the messy fields while Xu Muan who looked at Jingting\u2019s face said, \u201cDon\u2019t be sad.\u201dXiao Jingting shook his head and said, \u201cI\u2019m not sad. Life is not smooth sailing! If you suffer some losses, you could learn your lesson and gain some experience. \u201dXu Muan was a little surprised, \u201cYou\u2019re so open-minded!\u201dXiao Jingting smiled, no matter what, his current situation was much better than when he first arrived.Qiu Bai looked at the scene of Xu Muan and Xiao Jingting whispering together, their heads almost touching and his heart was in turmoil.\u2026\u2026Li Zhe looked at the field, shook his head, and said, \u201cAlthough this field is good, the location is too bad. Before, a family had bought this few mus of first grade fields but as result when demonic beasts come down the mountain, they were bitten to death.Qiu Li looked at Li Zhe with amazement and said, \u201cElder Li, tha\u2019ts unbelievable!\u201dLi Zhe nodded his head and said, \u201cAfter the demonic beasts killed people, this field hasn\u2019t been bought for a long time and many people thought it was ominous. \u201dQiu Li looked at Xiao Jingting and said anxiously, \u201cThen Young Master Xiao is not unlucky.\u201d\u201cYoung Master Xiao might not necessarily be. Master Xiao is already a fourth level Spirit Plant Master now and so is Xu Muan. Young Master Xiao\u2019s elder brother is also a fourth level Qi practitioner. Their strength is much better than those back then.\u201d\u201cOld Man Li, Xu Muan is also a fourth level Qi practitioner?\u201d Qiu Bai couldn\u2019t help asking.Although Xiao Jingting didn\u2019t say it explicitly, the villagers were able to guess Xiao Jingting\u2019s rank from his ability to farm, but they didn\u2019t expect Xu Muan to be a fourth level Qi practitioner as well.Li Zhe nodded and said, \u201cAlthough his Qi is a bit unstable, he should be a rank four Qi Practitioner, after all he is from a big family.\u201d Li Zhe couldn\u2019t help exclaiming.Qiu Bai felt the urge to ask,\u00a0\u201cElder Li, could it be possible that you are be wrong?\u201d\u00a0However, considering Li Zhe\u2019s position in the village, Qiu Bai swallowed these words.Qiu Bai looked in the direction of Xu Muan and his heart was filled with jealousy. Qiu Bai secretly thought:\u00a0Xu Muan being able to advance must have something to do with Xiao Jingting. If he followed Xiao Jingting, his strength certainly would grow rapidly. Unfortunately, Xiao Jingting didn\u2019t know what\u2019s good for him and ignored him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Therefore, Xiao Jingting very cheekily put the bed of Xiao Xiaofan and Xiao Xiaodong into another room and then, he naturally left the two kids for Xiao Jinfeng and Mu Shuyu to take care of.Xu Muan tacitly approved Xiao Jingting\u2019s arrangement.Xiao Xiaodong complained in mind about what his two fathers had done to them, but quickly accepted it in the end.Although Xiao Xiaofan didn\u2019t quite understand why his father wanted him to live with his second uncle, he still accepted the suggestion peacefully.Xiao Xiaofan liked to store snacks in secret places, so Xu Muan always confiscated them when he found them. After his room changed to Xiao Jinfeng\u2019s room, Xiao Xiaofan could finally hide snacks in an open and honest manner.Xiao Xiaodong was well aware of Xiao Xiaofan\u2019s trick. Xiao Xiaodong felt that his brother was really an idiot.After the harvest of five mus of first grade field, Xiao Jingting\u2019s silver reached around two thousand five hundred taels.During this period of time, Xu Muan and Xiao Jinfeng killed many demonic beasts and earned a lot of money.With silver in hand, Xiao Jingting wanted to buy something to replenish it, so the four of them gathered together to discuss it.\u201cYour spiritual field has been abandoned for two months. Although the people from the Marquis family will only investigate this matter in October, we can\u2019t rule out the possibility of people coming in advance, so you better keep 1,000 taels of silver to be not caught off guard.\u201d Xiao Jinfeng reminded.Xiao Jingting nodded and said, \u201cI know.\u201d The fine for the fields was like the stone that weighed on his heart.Xu Muan couldn\u2019t agree more with Xiao Jinfeng\u2019s proposal. They couldn\u2019t afford to offend the Marquis. If they weren\u2019t able to afford to pay a fine, they would need to bear the consequence.One thousand taels couldn\u2019t be used, so there were only 1500 taels left that could be used.\u201cI want to build two more rooms, one for Xiaodong and the other for Xiaofan.\u201dAlways letting these two brats live in one room with Xiao Jinfeng and Mu Shuyu, he was afraid it would seriously affect the development of these two people\u2019s relationship!With all of the recent additions to the house, the house was really a bit crowded.\u201cI also want to buy a bigger storage bag.\u201d It would be convenient to have a storage bag, since at the edge of the field you could use the storage bag to collect the food and bring it with you wherever you wanted to, without needing to move it around. It was even more convenient to have a storage bag when Xiao Jinfeng and Xu Muan went out for hunting.\u201cIt\u2019s better to buy some spirit jade. The top priority right now is to improve your spiritual power,\u201d Xiao Jiefeng said.Xiao Jingting eyes flashed with excitement as he said, \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dVisit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Spiritual jade was a type of jade that contained spiritual energy and could be used for cultivation. In the past when Xiao Jingting was still living in Xiao family, he had a monthly quota of one piece of spiritual jade which was the standard for the children of the Xiao family. The better their performance was in Xiao family, the more spiritual jade they could get.According to Xiao Jingting\u2019s knowledge, his parents sent five spiritual jades to Xiao Qingyan every month. Making the original body owner very jealous of his elder brother.Xiao Jinfeng was away all year round, so when he was away, his quota was often taken by Xiao Jingting. The original owner was very generous, and the precious spiritual jades were often given away to other people. Sometimes, when Xiao Jinfeng went back to Xiao family to get his share, the original body owner felt that Xiao Jinfeng had robbed him of spirit jades and was very unkind to Xiao Jinfeng.\u201cHow much is a piece of spiritual jade?\u201d Xiao Jingting asked.\u201cThe current market price is between two hundred and fifty to three hundred and twenty taels a piece, depending on the quality of the spiritual jade,\u201d Xiao Jinfeng said.Xiao Jingting was full of grievances as he said, \u201cSo expensive!\u201d After working for so long, he earned so little spirit jade! Most of the spirit jades in big families are given primarily to the top ones and according to Xiao Jingting\u2019s knowledge, that grandfather of his consumed dozens of spirit jades a day. Some people were luckier than others.Xu Muan who looked at Xiao Jingting\u2019s appearance was amused. Many commoner families only eat some spiritual food and then absorb some spiritual energy to cultivate. Spiritual jade was something that only the children of big families could enjoy.\u201cIn fact, the spiritual wine you brewed has a strong spiritual energy that is not worse than spirit jade. It a pity that you only sell it for a hundred taels,\u201d Xiao Jinfeng said.Xiao Jingting nodded and said, \u201cI know, I\u2019m not selling it now.\u201d \u00a0Xiao Jinfeng could drink as much as he brewed and Xu Muan also liked to drink, how could he have extra wine to sell!?Finally, Xiao Jingting spent one thousand taels to buy four pieces of spiritual jade, one hundred taels to repair the house, and three hundred taels to buy a two-cubic-meter and a four-cubic-meter storage bag, spending all of his money at once.After the spiritual jade arrived, Xiao Jingting wanted each of the four people to take one piece. But Xiao Jinfeng didn\u2019t take it and asked for two more jars of wine. Mu Shuyu didn\u2019t take it and asked for a few more clusters of grapes. Xu Muan didn\u2019t take it, wanting Xiao Jingting to practice well and improve his strength as soon as possible. When Xiao Jingting absorbed a piece of spiritual jade and found that the effect of spiritual jade was indeed very good but it was really too expensive, he threw remaining spirit jades to his space to save them for now.Xiao Jingting was still busy farming every day. As his strength increased, the cycle of planting spiritual plants became shorter and shorter.After a few more peaceful days, Mu Shuyu suddenly fainted in the field, frightening everyone.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Mu Shuyu had been working hard for Xiao Jinfeng before and when Xiao Jinfeng got better, he had been helping in farming. He was busy every day and stopped only when his spiritual energy was drained. He seemed to have abused a pregnant person.Xiao Jingting pulled the confused Xiao Jinfeng to the side and asked in a low voice, \u201cSecond brother, did you sleep with Mu Shuyu?\u201dXiao Jinfeng laughed awkwardly before saying, \u201cI guess so.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean by \u2018I guess so\u2019!\u201d Xiao Jingting was puzzled.\u201cAbout three months ago, the mercenary team did a lot of work and at that time everyone drank too much. You know, liquor is really my thing, so after a few drinks I got carried away. At that time, there were always people persuading others to drink, so everyone was competing. Although I can drink a lot, in the end I also become drunk.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know if someone did it on purpose, but a lot of the wine I was served had aphrodisiac in it. I was already half drunk then so I didn\u2019t notice anything wrong.\u201d\u201cThe wine was strong, so afterwards, in the middle of the night I became hot, aching, and I might have held Mu Shuyu in my arms. The next day when I woke up, no one was around me and Mu Shuyu looked as usual. I tried to sound him out about what happened the previous night but Mu Shuyu acted like normal, so I just thought I drunk too much and maybe had a lustful dream about having sex with him\u2026\u201dMu Shuyu became pregnant at that time.Xiao Jinfeng lowered his head and some evil thoughts flashed in the depths of his eyes. The last bit of affection left in his heart for the mercenary team was burned away.He always neglected this matter, feeling that he had drunk too much and the aphrodisiac wine served by his teammates was by mistake. But now when Xiao Jinfeng looked back, he felt that someone in the mercenary team was trying to set him up and make a fool of him. If he had found someone to hug at random, and if this matter came out\u2026Xiao Jingting, \u201c\u2026\u201d Xiao Jinfeng was really a blockhead! He couldn\u2019t even remember if he held Mu Shuyu or not.Xiao Jinfeng frowned. The old captain of the mercenary team was good to him, but the new captain was not. He had received a lot of favors from the old captain and the new captain was the nephew of the old captain so he had been courteous.When he was in the mercenary team, he always contributed a lot, but the new captain only thought of him as a young master of the Xiao family who had no shortage of resources and only came out to do tasks for the sake of experience and training. The things distributed to him would always be less than others and at first, several members of the team felt that he had been wronged but later all of them took it for granted. Him repeatedly giving in did not make people grateful!\u201cSecond brother, Mu Shuyu\u2019s condition doesn\u2019t seem to be too good. Please go in and have a look,\u201d Xiao Jingting said.Xiao Jinfeng nodded and said, \u201cGood.\u201dMu Shuyu who just woke up, felt a bit uncomfortable seeing Xiao Jinfeng.Xiao Jinfeng himself was also a little embarrassed, \u201cI drank too much that day, was it with you?\u201dMu Shuyu was silent for a moment but still nodded.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say something? I would definitely take responsibility for it.\u201d Xiao Jinfeng said.\u201cAt that time, you were the young master of the Xiao family! Besides, you had been engaged.\u201d Mu Shuyu said.Xiao Jinfeng\u2019s marriage was not his business alone. It concerned two big families, the Xiao family and the Sun family. At the same time, Xiao Jinfeng\u2019s marrying Sun Miaoyin would also solidify the position of Xiao Jinfeng\u2019s parents. If Xiao Jinfeng made trouble before his marriage, his reputation would be greatly affected.Ever since Xiao Jinfeng saved Mu Shuyu, Mu Shuyu had been very fond of him. After the two of them spent the night together, Mu Shuyu actually wanted to confess to Xiao Jinfeng.Before confessing, Mu Shuyu saw Sun Miaoyin in Desert city. The gentle, noble, and beautiful Sun Miaoyin gave Mu Shuyu a big blow. After meeting her, Mu Shuyu felt that it was better for Xiao Jinfeng to marry Sun Miaoyin, so he swallowed his confession of love.\u201cYou\u2026 have always been so considerate to me. No one has ever been so kind to me as you,\u201d Xiao Jinfeng said.\u00a0When he was abandoned by all those people, only Mu Shuyu still stayed with him.Mu Shuyu blushed slightly as he said, \u201cYou saved me! It\u2019s only right that I would look after you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve saved a lot of people, but not a lot of people have been gracious enough to return the favor.\u201d When he was in the mercenary team, he helped many people.Mu Shuyu pursed his lips and said softly after a long time, \u201cI like you.\u201dMu Shuyu was so soft that if it wasn\u2019t for Xiao Jinfeng\u2019s hearing, he would not be able to hear it. \u201cI like you too.\u201d Xiao Jinfeng grabbed Mu Shuyu\u2019s hand.Mu Shuyu raised the corners of his mouth. When he first came to Mound Village, he saw the scene of Xiao Jingting and Xu Muan getting along with each other. Although he didn\u2019t expect too much, he really envied them.Xiao Jingting watched Xiao Jinfeng walk out of the room and asked, \u201cYou talked with him?\u201dXiao Jinfeng nodded and said, \u201cYes, the child is mine.\u201dXiao Jingting looked at Xiao Jinfeng and said, \u201cIn this case, second brother you should marry him quickly. It\u2019s not good for Mu Shuyu\u2019s reputation to have a child out of wedlock. Mu Shuyu is much better than that\u00a0wicked girl from the Sun family.\u201d This world was very conservative, if his belly got bigger, Mu Shuyu would be an easy target of gossip.Xiao Jinfeng nodded and said, \u201cI think so too.\u201d\u201cIn our present situation, I\u2019m afraid we can\u2019t make a big deal out of it,\u201d Xiao Jingting said.\u201cShuyu also said that the most important thing for us now is to keep a low profile. Eldest aunt and the Sun family should still be watching us, so we should just do it simply.\u201d Xiao Jinfeng was a bit regretful.\u201cI\u2019m afraid we\u2019ll have to wrong him a little bit for this marriage. Second brother, you should treat him better in the future,\u201d Xiao Jingting said.Xiao Jinfeng nodded and said, \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to say this, I know.\u201d\u201cDid second brother make it clear with Mu Shuyu?\u201d Xu Muan asked.Xiao Jingting nodded and said, \u201cTo be honest, second brother was too muddleheaded, he wasn\u2019t even sure if he had sex with Mu Shuyu. If it wasn\u2019t for the fact that Mu Shuyu had a child, he would probably still know nothing about it. Now our family will have a wedding soon.\u201dXu Muan nodded and said, \u201cThis is a good thing!\u201dIn fact, Xu Muan secretly breathed a sigh of relief. Because Mu Shuyu was also a Spiritual Plant Master, many people who liked to gossip said that Mu Shuyu and Xiao Jingting were a good match, and although Xu Muan knew that there was nothing between Mu Shuyu and Xiao Jingting, his heart always felt uneasy.\u201cIt won\u2019t be a big deal this time, but we\u2019re going to send a more expensive congratulatory gift.\u201d Xiao Jingting said.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Xu Muan thought about it and said, \u201cYou said before that the Green Cloud Grass in your space is about to mature.\u201dAfter the two of them talked about it for a period of time, Xiao Jingting told Xu Muan about space in jade pendant as well.Xu Muan tried to use the jade pendant and found that he couldn\u2019t open the jade pendant space like Xiao Jingting could, but if Xiao Jingting didn\u2019t tell him, he wouldn\u2019t notice anything wrong with this jade pendant.Xiao Jingting planted Green Cloud Grass in the space before. After some period of time, Green Cloud Grass turned into three plants, one of which was about to mature.\u201cPerhaps, you can take that seed and give it to Mu Shuyu.\u201d The seeds of the Green Cloud Grass could be used by a cultivator to stimulate advancing to the next level. Xu Muan was actually not willing to give it up, however he thought that Mu Shuyu could help Xiao Jingting even more if he advanced. If Xiao Jingting wouldn\u2019t need to be busy all day long, Xu Muan was willing to part with it.\u201cYou were in too much of a hurry, otherwise this seed would have been for you,\u201d Xiao Jingting said.Xu Muan shook his head and said, \u201cIt\u2019s all right. I\u2019ve been promoted anyway.\u201d If he hadn\u2019t taken Lieyan Herb and got carried away by it, he and Xiao Jingting wouldn\u2019t be so open and honest with each other so quickly.\u201cWell, giving the seed is good.\u201d Xiao Jingting said. He had already advanced to level 4 and the seed of Green Cloud Grass had no use to him for the time being. When the aura in his body reached the peak of the fourth level, he would need a seed of Green Cloud Grass to advance, but then there would already be another mature seed in his space.The rise of Mu Shuyu\u2019s strength would also be beneficial to them.\u201cBy the way, the spiritual jades I put in my space are missing,\u201d Xiao Jingting said.\u201cThey are gone?\u201d Xu Muan was puzzled.Xiao Jingting nodded and said, \u201cIt\u2019s gone, I didn\u2019t care about it before. But after they disappeared, the Green Cloud Grass growing beside Spiritual Spring seemed to grow a lot faster. Perhaps the Spirit Jades can enhance the jade space. I could see that the jade space seemed to have grown a bit larger.\u201dXu Muan hesitated for a while before saying, \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then we must work hard to buy more Spiritual Jades.\u201dXiao Jingting nodded and said, \u201cYes! It\u2019ll still be a bit slow if we only rely on planting spiritual plants!\u201dXu Muan thought for a while and said, \u201cPerhaps, we can try to focus on cultivating some fifth-grade, or even sixth-grade spiritual plants in the space, and then sell them in a big city.\u201d It was too easy to attract unwanted attention in a small town by selling high-grade spiritual plants, but not in a bustling city.Xiao Jingting nodded and said, \u201cWe can give it a try. I\u2019ll go get some spiritual plant seeds to plant.\u201dIn order to prepare for the marriage of Xiao Jinfeng and Mu Shuyu, building additional rooms could no longer be delayed.With money to work with, Xu Muan hired a construction team and quickly built three more rooms as well as an additional thatched cottage as per Xiao Jingting\u2019s request.After the three rooms were built, the house became much more spacious.After the rooms were built, Xiao Xiaodong and Xiao Xiaofan moved into their new rooms. This wild world was different from the one in modern times, so as soon as the rooms were built, you were able to move in.At Xiao Xiaodong\u2019s request, Xiao Jingting bought another bed for Xiao Xiaodong.According to Xiao Xiaodong, Xiao Xiaofan liked to turn around when he slept. He turned in 360 degree circles, grinded his teeth, liked to put his stinky feet in his mouth and he also liked to hide snacks under his pillow. So, he was really fed up with the smell of food under his pillow.Xiao Xiaodong rarely made a request to Xiao Jingting, so naturally Xiao Jingting would not refuse it.Xiao Xiaofan was lying on Xiao Xiaodong\u2019s new bed and rolled around. \u201cBrother, why did you ask dad for another bed! In fact, it\u2019s fine if you sleep with me. I don\u2019t dislike you.\u201dXiao Xiaodong looked at Xiao Xiaofan rolling about on his new bed and said angrily, \u201cYou don\u2019t dislike me, but I dislike you.\u201dXiao Xiaofan looked at Xiao Xiaodong dejectedly and said, \u201cBrother, what do you dislike about me!? I have warmed your blankets, so you will be warm as soon as you go to sleep.\u201dXiao Xiaodong looked at Xiao Xiaofan and said angrily, \u201cYou! Smell like food.\u201dXiao Xiaofan sniffed with his nose and said somewhat aggrievedly, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d\u201cThis is the bed Dad bought for me, get down.\u201d Xiao Xiaodong said. In Xiao Xiaodong\u2019s opinion, this bed was the first formal gift Xiao Jingting ever gave to him. Xiao Xiaodong might not show it on his face, but he was very fond of this bed in his heart.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

How come I haven\u2019t seen you bring them back recently? Why don\u2019t you go and pick up two more clusters?\u201d Qiu father asked.Qiu Bai frowned, slightly dissatisfied, \u201cFather, grapes are sold out and gone.\u201dQiu Bai felt a little resentful in his heart. Xiao Jingting specially paid the village people to watch the grapes to prevent people from 'stealing\u201d them. He brazenly went to the Xiao family twice to pick up grapes, people from the village looked at him strangely and not many grapes landed in his hands, so Qiu Bai simply stopped being this kind of villain.Qiu father was envious and sighed, \u201cThese grapes are really good. Some people in the village say the reason why Xiao Jingting and Xu Muan were able to advance to the fourth level is all thanks to these grapes. If your brother also had grapes to eat every day, he would soon also advance to level three.\u201dQiu Bai rolled his eyes in his heart, his brother wanted to eat grapes every day. But unfortunately, he didn\u2019t have the ability to grow grapes!Qiu Bai used to worship Qiu Li very much, but as he watched Xiao Jingting\u2019s life, which was despised by Qiu Li earlier, flourish when his own family still remained the same, Qiu Bai could not help but have a little prejudice towards Qiu Li, who always had a high opinion of himself.\u201cIf I had known it, I would have let you marry Xiao Jingting and you would have followed him to drink and eat spicy food with him by now.\u201d Father Qiu shook his head.Qiu Bai looked at father Qiu and thought secretly,\u00a0My father is not hoping that I could follow Xiao Jingting to eat and drink spicy food with him. But he hoped that I could marry Xiao Jingting so I could help my elder brother. If the two families become in-laws, it would be natural for his father to go to the Xiao family to ask for things.\u201cDo you know that the Xiao family has built three new titled rooms?\u201d Father Qiu asked.Qiu Bai nodded and said, \u201cI know.\u201d\u201cIt costs a lot to build three more rooms, but that is not a big deal for the Xiao family now,\u201d Father Qiu said, \u201cThere\u2019s so much more that can be done when you become stronger. I didn\u2019t expect that the black sheep of the Xiao family could be so capable when he got serious,\u201d Father Qiu added.Qiu Bai bit his lip and didn\u2019t say anything. When the Xiao family was building a house, Qiu Bai went to see it and watched Xu Muan arrange people to work in an orderly manner. Qiu Bai only felt that the possibilities were\u00a0limitless.\u201cHowever, no matter how capable he is, he is just a farmer now. After all, he can\u2019t compare with the young master of a large family now. I went to ask Xiao Jingting and he is not willing to marry you. It just so happens that the son of the town Officer Li is willing to marry you. He\u2019s seen you and become very fond of you. It would be better for you to marry into the Li family house,\u201d Father Qiu said.Qiu Bai frowned and said, \u201cFather, you have decided my life without even asking me.\u201dFather Qiu didn\u2019t have a good temper \u201cCan your father harm you? If Xiao Jingting was interested in you, I could also consider him. However, he is indifferent to you now, do you want to be given a cold shoulder? Li family runs a big business in town. If you marry into the Li family, you will become rich in the future.\u201dQiu Bai nodded and said, \u201cI understand, father, I\u2019ll marry him.\u201dThe villagers had a natural yearning for rich families. Qiu Bai originally wanted to marry into a big family. However, Xiao Jingting had had a good life recently, and Qiu Bai had become a little hesitant.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Xiao family.\u201cSecond brother, have you thought about what betrothal gift you will give Mu Shuyu?\u201d Xiao Jingting asked.The poisoning made Xiao Jinfeng poor. Before the poisoning, Xiao Jinfeng made hundreds of taels of silver from killing demonic beasts, but his expenses were also great, so although he had saved some silver, it wasn\u2019t much.\u201cThere is a level 4 demonic beast in the forest. If I kill it and give it to Shuyu, Shuyu will certainly be happy,\u201d Xiao Jinfeng said.As far as Xiao Jingting knew, the wind chasing beast ran very fast, and had a single horn on the top of its head that could be used as medicine to improve the speed of absorbing spiritual energy.Xiao Jingting knitted his brows and said, \u201cSecond brother, the wind chasing beast is not easy to deal with.\u201dXiao Jinfeng smiled and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, your second brother has even dealt with a level five demonic beast, a level four demonic beast is nothing. Moreover, Muan promised to help me. He is also level four now and with his help, it will be much safer.\u201dVisit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201cCount me in as well,\u201d Xiao Jingting said cheerfully.Xiao Jinfeng nodded and said, \u201cGood! Third Brother, when you arrive, just assist me. There is no need for you to rush ahead.\u201dXiao Jingting, \u201c\u2026 \u201d Is Xiao Jinfeng not trusting his abilities?\u201cSecond brother, it must have been hard for you when you were in the mercenary team.\u201d When Xiao Jinfeng first joined the mercenary team, he was only a level three Qi Practitioner. Xiao Jingting admired Xiao Jinfeng\u2019s courage very much.If Xiao Qingyan joined the mercenary team, the parents of the original body owner would certainly not agree. The mercenary team had a very high casualty rate, and their lives were at constant risk. But the one who joined the mercenary team was Xiao Jinfeng, so the parents of the original body owner agreed with Xiao Jinfeng\u2019s choice.\u201cThere was an old captain at the time who took care of me,\u201d Xiao Jinfeng said.In fact, after several years in the mercenary team, Xiao Jinfeng was able to do it alone and there were other mercenary teams that wanted to poach him and promised him a lot of benefits. However, Xiao Jinfeng had always kept his old captain\u2019s kindness in mind and did not leave.Xiao Jinfeng closed his eyes and laughed coldly. Looking back, he realized that he was really a bit stupid. He couldn\u2019t give up the mercenary team, but the mercenary team could give up on him.Xiao Jingting patted Xiao Jinfeng\u2019s hand and said, \u201cSecond brother, you can only hunt with me in the future. I don\u2019t want you to think I would be in the way!\u201d\u201cI heard from Muan that your fighting ability isn\u2019t too good, and you are very wasteful. You should work on it.\u201d Xiao Jinfeng.Xiao Jinting laughed awkwardly and said, \u201cMuan discredited me, after all I am still a novice.\u201d\u201cBy the way, I saw an old man looking for you yesterday. He seemed to be in conflict with you, what did you say?\u201d Xiao Jinfeng asked.Xiao Jinting rolled his eyes and said with some annoyance, \u201cThat was Qiu Bai\u2019s father. He asked me to leave Muan and marry his son.\u201dXiao Jinfeng was stunned for a moment then said, \u201cIs that so? Is that old man out of his mind?\u201d\u201cI did some ridiculous things before, but now I have thought it through. Second brother, please don\u2019t tell Xu Muan about it.\u201d Xiao Jingting said.Xiao Jinfeng nodded and said, \u201cI know.\u201dXiao Jingting shrugged and said, \u201cThat old man said that his son will soon marry into a rich family. If I was willing to leave Muan, he could also consider me but since I am not willing, he will no longer consider me.\u201dXiao Jinfeng, \u201c\u2026This old man, there is something wrong with him!\u201dXiao Jingting shrugged and said, \u201cWho knows.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Now that they were going deeper into the jungle, Xiao Jingting could not help but feel a little excited.Xiao Jinfeng was at the front, Xiao Jingting was in the middle and Xu Muan was following behind, guarding them.\u201cIt\u2019s just ahead, be careful.\u201d Xiao Jinfeng said.Xiao Jingting nodded and said, \u201cGood! I heard that there are often precious medicinal herbs near demonic beast lairs.\u201dXiao Jinfeng nodded and said, \u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d\u201cHere we are.\u201d Xiao Jinfeng leapt up the tree to observe the movement.\u201cTake these\u00a0bamboo rats out.\u201d Xiao Jinfeng said after observing for a while.When Xiao Jingting heard this, he released a few football-sized bamboo rats.As soon as the bamboo rats were out, they scattered, immediately running away.Xiao Jingting and others held their breath as they observed their movements.After a long time, a demon beast with a body length of two meters, covered with black fur and a single horn, ran out.The Wind Chasing Beast walked around in a guarded manner, making Xiao Jingting\u2019s heart thump when he saw this majestic demonic beast.Not only was the wind chasing beast very agile, but it was also very alert. Before coming to the jungle, Xiao Jinfeng sprayed them with the medicine that Mu Shuyu had prepared that could disrupt the Wind Chasing Beast\u2019s sense of smell, otherwise they would already be discovered by now.After a long time, the Wind Chasing Beast didn\u2019t find anything wrong and rushed out, catching a bamboo rat with a bite.Although the bamboo rats were released, scattered and escaped, the Wind Chasing Beast\u2019s tracking ability was so strong that none of the released bamboo rats escaped.The Wind Chasing Beast that had eaten and drunk enough, leisurely returned.\u201cSecond brother, when are we going to do it?\u201d Xiao Jingting spoke to Xiao Jinfeng.\u201cIt will take another half an hour for the medicine to take full effect, so we still need to wait for a while before we do anything,\u201d Xiao Jinfeng said.Xiao Jingting nodded and obeyed Xiao Jinfeng\u2019s words.Xiao Jingting waited patiently for a few hours then he leapt down the tree under Xiao Jinfeng\u2019s order.They carefully entered the lair, the Wind \u00a0Chasing Beast was dozing off in the lair but immediately roared when it felt an intrusion.Xiao Jingting first spawned countless vines to restrict the movement of the Wind Chasing Beast.The wind chasing beast waved its claws and tore apart the vines that Xiao Jingting had spawned. Xu Muan took advantage of the wind chasing beast fighting the vines and launched his\u00a0sleeve arrows. The sleeve arrow that Xu Muan lost was found, and six sleeve arrows were refined again, becoming much more powerful than before.Even though it was poisoned, the Wind Chasing Beast\u2019s movements were still very agile, so four of the six sleeve arrows missed.Xiao Jinfeng launched a fireball, and the black fur of the Wind Chasing Beast immediately burned. Most beasts were afraid of fire, and the wind chasing beast was no exception. Seeing its fur being burned up, the wind chasing beast roared and rolled on the ground.Xiao Jinfeng and Xu Muan launched an even stronger fire attack. Xiao Jinfeng used his seal to smash Wind Chasing Beast on its head.Xiao Jingting looked at the seal taken out by Xiao Jinfeng and became a little curious. The seal in Xiao Jinfeng\u2019s hand was called the Python Seal, it was said that this seal needed to be soaked in the blood of several level 6 pythons which were extremely evil and powerful. This seal was one of the few gifts given to Xiao Jinfeng by the original body owner\u2019s parents.It was probably because the medicine took full effect that the speed of Wind Chasing Beast slowed down a lot.Xiao Jinfeng used Python Seal to smash the beast more than ten times in a row, breaking the head of Wind Chasing Beast.With the full cooperation of the three of them, the Wind Chasing Beast was quickly killed.Once the beast was dead, the three of them became immediately relieved.\u201cKilling the demonic beast isn\u2019t as difficult as I thought it would be!\u201d Xiao Jingting said with excitement.Xiao Jinfeng said helplessly, \u201cDon\u2019t take it lightly. Many old and experienced hunters died because of ignorant pride. This time if we weren\u2019t well prepared, it wouldn\u2019t be so easy to succeed. Wind Chasing Beasts are extremely fast, if you let it get close to you, it would be very dangerous.\u201dXiao Jingting nodded his head as he was taught and said, \u201cI know.\u201dThe three people walked around the lair of Wind Chasing Beast. The cave of Wind Chasing Beast was very spacious and there was a pool of water. Xu Muan found a few stones emitting aura at the bottom of the pool, looking somehow similar to spirit jade. Xu Muan gave the stones to Xiao Jingting, who sent them into the space.The three of them walked around the area but didn\u2019t find any spiritual plants.\u201cI thought there would be good quality spiritual plants in the lair of the Wind Chasing Beast.\u201d Xiao Jingting was a bit regretful.\u201cDon\u2019t be too greedy. Those stones you got are of good quality, and if you sell them, you could earn three or four hundred taels. Let\u2019s go, finding the road in the dark won\u2019t be easy,\u201d Xiao Jinfeng said.Xiao Jingting nodded and answered, \u201cYes.\u201dXiao Jinfeng brought the beast back to the village, which caused many people to come over to watch. They also learned that Xiao Jinfeng and Mu Shuyu were going to get married and the Wind Chasing Beast was the betrothal gift given to Mu Shuyu by Xiao Jinfeng. No matter what the villagers thought, people still expressed their blessings. Many newlyweds in the wild mainland would give their loved ones prey which on one hand represented wealth and on the other hand, showed the groom\u2019s excellent combat effectiveness.Xiao Jinfeng had a very bad reputation in the village. Qiu Li spread the gossip everywhere that Xiao Jinfeng was fierce and he was driven out of the Xiao family because he attempted to rape his cousin\u2019s wife. Xiao Jinfeng\u2019s character was so bad that no one was willing to marry him.When the news came out that Xiao Jinfeng was going to get married, many people in the village laughed at Qiu Li for talking nonsense, causing Qiu Li to become very angry.Coincidentally, the wedding dates of the Qiu and Xiao families were chosen on the same day.Father Qiu spread the news all over the village that his son was going to marry into a big family and become a master. Many people who heard the rumors were very jealous of Qiu Bai.Hearing that Qiu Bai was going to marry into a big family, Xu Muan became relieved. Although Xu Muan understood that Xiao Jingting was no longer the same and this Xiao Jingting was very displeased with Qiu Bai, he still felt uneasy as long as this person was in front of them.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Xiao Jinfeng chose to get married in a very low-key manner, and Xu Muan chose to invite only a few families to participate.Halfway through the wedding, people from the Marquis Mansion came to check first class fields that were deserted before. People from the Marquis Mansion were very direct, saying that Xiao Jingting had abandoned farmland for three months and needed to pay a three-month fine, which was 1500 taels in total.The huge fine scared all the guests who came to the Xiao family for the wedding.Most of the villagers did not know about this rule. Some villagers only felt that it was a pity that Xiao Jingting\u2019s fields were deserted, but never thought that deserting the fields would cost so much money.Xiao Jingting\u2019s few mu of first-class field, to be exact, should have been deserted for two months and twenty-seven days. Xiao Jingting asked Xiao Jinfeng about it and according to Xiao Jinfeng, as long as it was less than three months, they should only pay a fine of two months.\u201cThe people of Marquis Mansion said three months.\u201d Xiao Jingting could not argue with them and could only take out the silver. Xiao Jingting had already prepared money for the fine, however, it was only 1,000 taels, so Xu Muan took 300 taels of silver out and Xiao Jinfeng also gave 200 taels out, before sending them away.At the wedding of the Xiao family, the people from Marquis Mansion came to ask for a huge fine, which became a topic of conversation among the villagers.\u201cSo it turns out that there\u2019s a fine for deserting the field, I\u2019ve never heard of it before!\u201d\u201cThere was no such rule before, it should be a new rule from the Marquis.\u201d\u201cThe Marquis is too overbearing. The fine is too high.\u201d\u201cWhat nonsense are you talking about? How dare you speak ill of Marquis?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just talking casually, but Master Xiao is really rich! He took a thousand taels of silver out without blinking an eye.\u201d\u201cExactly! That\u2019s 1,500 taels! It\u2019s enough to buy dozens of mus of first-class fields.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s really strange that the people from Marquis Mansion didn\u2019t come sooner or later, but picked the time when people got married to collect the fine.\u201d\u201cYes! It\u2019s too strange, it\u2019s a good thing that the Xiao family had enough silver, if they didn\u2019t, they would go to jail.\u201d\u2026\u2026The huge fine of the Xiao family made the villagers feel sorry for them and most of them expressed their sympathy for the Xiao family, while other people thought that the Xiao family was really rich and could afford such a large fine for ordinary people.At night, Xiao Jingting sat in front of the window, frowning.\u201cGoing to sleep?\u201d Xu Muan asked.\u201cI can\u2019t sleep.\u201d Xiao Jingting gritted his teeth. Thinking of those people from the Marquis\u2019s residence storming into his own home, Xiao Jingting felt very stifled. The feeling of needing to rely on others made Xiao Jingting feel very depressed.\u201cIn this world, strength is the most important thing, when you are strong enough to crush these people, these people will naturally have to look up to you,\u201d Xu Muan said. The people who came this time, their leader was a 6-level Qi Practitioner and just by standing there, he could give people a great pressure.Xiao Jingting narrowed his eyes, \u201cThis bunch of people, from all days, they chose today.\u201dXu Muan lowered his head and said, \u201cI think someone behind the scene helped them chose the date.\u201d\u201cCould it be the Xiao family?\u201d Xiao Jingting asked.Xu Muan nodded and said, \u201cIt\u2019s possible, but I think it\u2019s more likely that someone from the village was jealous. Xiao Ping has sent me another letter, saying that your uncle has advanced to the seventh level as well as your third uncle. The old man also left seclusion, so your first and third uncle will compete to curry favor with your grandfather. So he shouldn\u2019t have time to pay attention to you and your second brother.\u201d Xiao Jinfeng and Mu Shuyu\u2019s marriage was hastily decided, and the other side of the Xiao Family should not pay attention to this.Xiao Jingting narrowed his eyes and said, \u201cThat\u2019s it! Don\u2019t let me know which asshole did it.\u201d\u201cI think it might be Qiu Li.\u201d Xu Muan said.Xiao Jingting curiously asked, \u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d\u201cWe didn\u2019t offend many people in this village, and not many people know laws and regulations. This guy Qiu Li often goes to town and is regarded as an intellectual in the town. Recently, you ignored his brother, so he may hate you for that,\u201d Xu Muan said.Xiao Jingting nodded and said, \u201cThat makes sense! Moreover, Qiu Li often wanders around my field and seemed recalcitrant.\u201d\u201cHe used to be a talent of the village, but now you have stolen the limelight from him,\u201d Xu Muan said.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Are you all right?\u201d Aunt Li asked.Xu Muan smiled and said, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d Although something bad happened during Xiao Jinfeng\u2019s wedding, it was finally over.\u201cYesterday those people had gone too far. From all days they could come, they had to pick up that day.\u201d Aunt Li was full of resentment.Xu Muan lowered his head, although yesterday was a bit unpleasant, after this group of people came, Xu Muan finally let go of his worries of keeping money to pay for their creditors who were about to come. It was not a happy thing, but those people were too arrogant.\u201cYesterday, Qiu Bai got married. Father Qiu showed off his son all day long and wanted to marry him into a big family. But in fact, Qiu Bai became a concubine.\u201d Aunt Li was full of disdain.Xu Muan was a bit surprised, \u201cBecame a concubine?\u201dIn this world, the status of a concubine was very low. If you become a concubine, you will be a member of your husband\u2019s family and have nothing to do with your own family. The husband\u2019s family could even sell the concubine.In fact, Xu Muan was also married to Xiao Jingting as a concubine and Xiao Jingting could sell Xu Muan if he wanted. This was also the reason why Xu Muan tolerated a lot of things the original Xiao Jingting did.Aunt Li nodded and said, \u201cYes! Father Qiu always said how rich the family his son was married in was and how rich his future days would be. He used to\u00a0put gold in one\u2019s face (glorifying oneself or others by exaggerating to gain favor.). But the family didn\u2019t seem to take Qiu Bai seriously and\u00a0married him with only a small sedan chair.\u201dXu Muan squinted his eyes. As far as he was concerned, Qiu Bai married off and won\u2019t bother them anymore, so everything would be fine. As for what kind of family he married in, Xu Muan didn\u2019t care.\u201cFather Qiu was willing to let his second son be a concubine. Did the Li family give him some precious betrothal gifts?\u201d Xu Muan asked.Aunt Li said mysteriously, \u201cI heard they gave two pieces of Spirit Jade.\u201dXu Muan squinted his eyes.\u00a0No wonder, two pieces of spiritual jade were worth quite a bit of silver. \u201cIt\u2019s for Qiu Li, isn\u2019t it?\u201dAunt Li nodded and said, \u201cYes, what is more precious for Father Qiu than his son? If not, he would not have married Qiu Bai in a hurry. I heard that the Master Li who Qiu Bai married, already has two concubines and a main wife who is very fierce.\u201dXu Muan laughed and said, \u201cReally?\u201d Qiu Bai was also a restless one. After marrying over to the Li family, he was afraid that the peaceful days of Li family were over.\u201cI didn\u2019t think it would take so much silver for abandoning fields, people from the Marquis mansion is really trying to cheat people. It would have been nice if Master Xiao had come to his senses a little earlier.\u201d Aunt Li sighed with exclamations.\u201cBecause he could come to his senses, spending some silver is nothing.\u201d Xu Muan said indifferently. Xiao Jingting changing his personality was already an unattainable thing and he didn\u2019t dare to ask for more.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Xiao family.\u201cSecond brother,\u00a0you\u2019re up so early! I thought you\u00a0were going to stay up late. There is a saying that\u00a0nights of rendezvous are always too short!\u201d\u00a0Jingting looked at the energetic Xiao Jinfeng.Xiao Jinfeng smiled awkwardly and said, \u201cIt is not suitable for Shuyu to do strenuous exercise now.\u201dXiao Jingting, \u201c\u2026\u201dVisit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201cBrother, your gift was too valuable.\u201d Xiao Jinfeng originally did not know what Xiao Jingting gave them but after looking at it yesterday, he could not help feeling shocked.Xiao Jingting didn\u2019t care, \u201cBrother, just take it. Besides, if second sister-in-law becomes stronger, it will just reduce my burden.\u201d\u201cYou!\u201d Xiao Jinfineg hit Xiao Jingting on the chest.Xiao Jingting folded his arms and said, \u201cSecond sister-in-law is not an outsider. We brothers already came to this point, if we don\u2019t\u00a0help one another,\u00a0how can we go on?\u201dXiao Jinfeng nodded and said, \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cI am going to the field.\u201d Xiao Jingting said.\u201cWorking so hard? Going so early.\u201d Xiao Jinfeng was a little surprised.\u201cI am not working hard! Just yesterday we spent one thousand and five hundred taels of silver!\u201d Xiao Jingting shook his head.Xiao Jinfeng frowned and said, \u201cThese people who came yesterday were really too excessive. They originally should have only asked for 1000 tales. The remaining 500 taels probably have filled the pockets of people who came here yesterday.\u201dYesterday, the person who came here reported a fine of 1500 taels. At that time, the village chief casually begged for mercy but one of the men kicked him, which was quite fierce. The leader also said directly, \u201cTake out the money, if you don\u2019t have it, you will go to jail. I don\u2019t care if you are some young master from Xiao family, in front of Marquis family, Xiao family is not worth even a fart.\u201dThe man who came did not consider Xiao Jingting\u2019s feelings at all, and left high and mighty after taking the silver.After the wedding yesterday, Xiao Jingting and Xu Muan went to the village head\u2019s house and gave a generous gift to express their gratitude.\u201cWhen I get stronger in the future, I will definitely teach a lesson to these groups of arrogant people but right now, I still need to improve my strength,\u201d Xiao Jingting said.Xiao Jinfeng patted Xiao Jingting on the shoulder and said, \u201cI\u2019ll go with you to the fields and check the traps along the way.\u201dXiao Jingting nodded and said, \u201cAll right!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Xu Muan was very interested in it, so Xiao Jingting told Xu Muan all those he knew.Xu Muan had brewed spiritual wine several times, and finally could do it better than Xiao Jingting.Mu Shuyu came out of the room and said, \u201cMaking wine!\u201dXu Muan nodded and said, \u201cYes! Jingting wants to make some higher-grade wine to sell.\u201d Xiao Jingting planted some high-level spiritual plants in his jade space. When these plants were used to make wine, the spiritual energy was very strong.Mu Shuyu nodded and said, \u201cGood idea. There are many drunkards like Jinfeng in the world and there are many people who are willing to spend a lot of money for the sake of fine wine. Most of the money earned from mercenary work by Jinfeng was spent on fine wine. It saves a lot of money when he drinks homemade wine and Jinfeng said that the wine brewed at home is much better than the wine he drank outside.\u201dXu Muan smiled and said \u201cAs long as second elder brother thinks it tastes good.\u201d The profit of spiritual wine was very great and if wine sold well, it could make money much faster than farming.\u201cIs there anything I can help you with?\u201d Mu Shuyu asked.\u201cNo, I\u2019ll do it, it would be too\u00a0inconvenient\u00a0for you since you\u2019re pregnant.\u00a0You\u2019d better go and have a rest,\u201d Xu Muan said.Mu Shuyu looked at Xu Muan, smiled helplessly and said, \u201cMuan, I am just pregnant, not disabled. You don\u2019t have to take care of me like this.\u201dXu Muan nodded and said, \u201cAlright, then you can help me wash the sweet potatoes.\u201dMu Shuyu said happily \u201cYes!\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Qiu family.\u201cSon! You should make good use of these two pieces of jade!\u201d Father Qiu warned solemnly.Qiu Li nodded and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, father, I know.\u201d Originally, Qiu Li did not want to marry Qiu Bai to Mr. Li as a concubine. However, when Mr. Li promised two pieces of spiritual jade as a bride price, Qiu Li couldn\u2019t help feeling excited.Qiu Li\u2019s cultivation hadn\u2019t improved for a long time. Seeing the Xiao family members advance to level four one by one, Qiu Li might not show it on his face but he was very anxious.The betrothal gifts of two pieces of spiritual jade offered by Master Li looked like life-saving straws, making Qiu Li immediately moved.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect Xiao Jingting to be really so rich. It\u2019s 1500 taels of silver and he just took it out without any difficult. In the end, he was the young master of the Xiao family. Even a skinny camel is bigger than a horse. He must have brought out a lot of silver from the Xiao family,\u201d Qiu Li sourly said.\u201cNot necessarily. Xiao Jingting knows how to farm, and he has sold a lot of spiritual plants from his fields for good money.\u201d Father Qiu said.Qiu Li coldly glanced at Father Qiu, making him rub his hand and not speak anymore. Xiao Jingting knows how to farm, this was acknowledged by all people in the village, but Qiu Li stubbornly felt that everything Xiao Jingting had was due to his good family background.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Since Xiao Jingting changed his behaviors, Qiu Li felt that all his limelight was robbed by Xiao Jingting. By chance Qiu Li learned from a young master in the city about the edict issued by the Marquis\u2019s house. Qiu Li immediately hid it and never let it slip out. He deliberately chose the day before Xiao Jinfeng\u2019s marriage to write a report letter and sure enough, people from the Marquis Mansion came on the day of Xiao Jinfeng\u2019s wedding.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Xiao Jingting stayed in the field, rapidly spawning plants. Xiao Jingting now drunk water from spiritual spring everyday and his strength was rising steadily.Originally, it would have taken Xiao Jingting one day to give five mus of low-class field a boost, but now it only took him one hour.There were very few level four plant masters in the village so when Xiao Jingting planted, there were always people watching.Xiao Jingting planted, and Xiao Jinfeng helped Xiao Jingting take care of the field. Xu Muan was busy brewing wine and taking care of the household affairs while Mu Shuyu was busy helping Xu Muan and occasionally helping prepare some medicine to cover the smell of mature spiritual plants.\u201cMaster Xiao, you\u2019re amazing! By the way, Master Xiao, did you know that Qiu Li of the Qiu family has advanced to the third level, which made Father Qiu extremely happy?\u201d\u201cQiu Li\u2019s ability is one of the best in the village, but when compared to you Master Xiao, he is much worse.\u201d\u201cYes! Master Xiao, I heard that your sister-in-law has also advanced to level four. It\u2019s awesome! Your family are all level four Qi practitioners, it\u2019s unique in the village.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dXiao Jingting smiled helplessly. He was not much of a gossiper. But even though he did not gossip, many people gossiped with him and told him all the small and big things that happened in the village.Did Qiu Li advance to the third level? It was not so surprising. Qiu Li, the \u2018talent\u2019 of the village was at the edge of second level of Qi Practice for quite some time.Xiao Jingting squinted his eyes, it was much harder to advance to third level of Qi Practice than to advance from third level to fourth level of Qi Practice.If there was no Xiao family, Qiu Li entering the third level of Qi Practice would be enough to make waves in the village. But with Xiao family there, Qiu Li\u2019s achievements were nothing. In addition, Mu Shuyu entered the fourth level of Qi Practice only two days after Qiu Li\u2019s advancement, so there were very few people who would mention Qiu Li.Xiao Jingting was very disgusted with this Qiu Li who thought he was above everyone else and as far as he knew, Qiu Li also disliked him very much. The incident in Xiao Jinfeng\u2019s wedding seemed to be the work of Qiu Li, which made Xiao Jingting dislike him even more.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In the past, when he was still in the Xiao family, he would get one piece of spiritual jade every month.The oldest brother Xiao Qingyan was talented, so his parents would give him five or six pieces of spiritual jade every month without him doing anything and reportedly a lot of silver as well. Before, the original body owner expressed his opposition and disliked that his parents were so biased. But father Xiao explained that the academy was full of rich students, and if Xiao Qingyan didn\u2019t have money to hang around in it, he would be looked down upon by his classmates and mentors.\u201cKeep the money and buy a flying beast so that we won\u2019t have to waste time on the road every day,\u201d Xiao Jinfeng said.Xiao Jingting had thought about buying a flying demonic beast for a long time, but he had never been able to put it into action. Now he had a chance.Xu Muan looked at Xiao Jingting\u2019s bright eyes when he mentioned buying a demonic beast and was somewhat amused.\u201cSecond brother, you should also have a share of this silver.\u201d Xiao Jingting said. If it wasn\u2019t for Xiao Jinfeng\u2019s help in killing the demonic beasts, all spiritual plants in the field would meet disaster.\u201cAfter drinking so much of your spiritual wine, your second brother is already embarrassed enough.\u201d Xiao Jinfeng waved his hand. He helped Xiao Jingting to take care of the demonic beasts, but Xu Muan also helped and most of the silver earned from selling demonic beast corpses went to him. Xiao Jinfeng\u2019s main expenses were wine, and now drinking wine made by his own family saved him a lot.\u201cThe other first-class fields will not attract too many troublesome demonic beasts, so I should take advantage of this period of time to take the spiritual wine to a big city to sell it,\u201d Xiao Jinfeng said.They had discussed before that the purchasing power of people in small towns were limited, so spiritual wine couldn\u2019t be sold for a more expensive price and it would be better to take it to the big city. Although it would be a bit more troublesome, they will be able to earn more silver. Moreover, selling wine in the small town could easily attract unwanted attention, so it would be better for them to keep a low profile.Xiao Jingting nodded and said, \u201cOkay, second brother! After selling the wine, you can see what cultivation resources there are in the big cities and bring some back.\u201dXiao Jinfeng nodded and said, \u201cAll right.\u201dMu Shuyu chose to go with Xiao Jinfeng. The people in the Wasteland continent were much stronger than those on Earth. There were also a lot of people who could easily kill demonic beasts when they were pregnant, so taking a cart from the road and travelling a long way was nothing.\u2026\u2026Xiao Jinfeng and Mu Shuyu drove for two days before they finally arrived at Wind City.In order to save money, Xiao Jinfeng and Mu Shuyu casually found a tea stall and sat down instead of going to a restaurant.\u201cJinfeng, they said that there are students from Bifeng Academy coming to Wind City to do missions,\u201d Mu Shuyu said.Xiao Jinfeng nodded and said, \u201cYes.\u201dXiao Jinfeng\u2019s affection for Xiao Qingyan was very complicated. Xiao Jinfeng originally had some admiration for his big brother, but Xiao Qingyan always acted high and mighty in front of Xiao Jinfeng. Xiao Jinfeng\u2019s temper was never very good, so Xiao Qingyan didn\u2019t like him very much, and Xiao Jinfeng would not allow himself to be snubbed despite showing good intentions.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201cDo you think your brother will be in Wind City?\u201d Mu Shuyu asked.\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d When he met troubles before, Xiao Jinfeng wrote to Xiao Qingyan for help but his several letters were all left without answers, which made Xiao Jinfeng very disappointed with Xiao Qingyan. \u201cIt will depend on fate,\u201d Xiao Jinfeng said.Mu Shuyu nodded and said, \u201cGood!\u201d\u2026\u2026\u201cQingyan! Isn\u2019t that your brother down there?\u201d In the Falling Moon Restaurant, a young man who played with the folding fan in his hand faintly said.Xiao Qingyan looked downstairs and said in a calm voice, \u201cIt should be just someone who resembles him. It\u2019s impossible for my brother to be here.\u201d\u201cYes, your brother attempted to rape your brother\u2019s wife! You should find a hole in the ground to hide in now, how could you come out in the public?\u201d Zhao He said half-jokingly.Xiao Qingyan\u2019s face sank as he snorted coldly and didn\u2019t say anything.After the accident of Xiao\u2019s father and mother, Xiao Qingyan\u2019s situation suddenly became much worse. After Xiao Jinfeng\u2019s accident, Xiao Qingyan\u2019s reputation was also affected. Xiao Qingyan had received Xiao Jinfeng\u2019s letter for help, however he was very dissatisfied with Xiao Jinfeng, so how could he lend him a hand?\u201cQingyan! Do you know where your brother has gone?\u201d Xiao Qingyan obviously didn\u2019t want to talk more about this issue, but Zhao He clung to it.\u201cHe has been kicked out of the house, so he is no longer my brother,\u201d Xiao Qingyan said coldly.Zhao He touched his chin and said, \u201cQingyan, don\u2019t be so heartless! You\u2019re brothers, connected by blood.\u201dXiao Qingyan said coldly, \u201cThis is my family business.\u201dZhao He shrugged and no longer spoke.Xiao Qingyan stood by the window, looking at Xiao Jinfeng and Mu Shuyu talking and laughing downstairs, a bit of fury flashing in his eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Although he knew that Xiao Qingyan might also be in Wind City, he was still surprised to suddenly see him.\u201cDon\u2019t call me big brother. I don\u2019t have a shameless brother like you.\u201d Xiao Qingyan was impatient.Xiao Jinfeng\u2019s face sank as he said, \u201cI thought that big brother understood that I was wronged.\u201d\u201cWhether you\u2019re innocent or not, I don\u2019t care. I\u2019ve only come to remind you to leave Wind City quickly and don\u2019t cause me any trouble,\u201d Xiao Qingyan coldly said.Xiao Jinfeng\u2019s face twisted but it quickly returned to normal.Xiao Jinfeng coldly said, \u201cI understand, don\u2019t worry, you don\u2019t want to have a brother with a bad reputation, and I don\u2019t want to have a heartless brother like you.\u201d\u201cYou!\u201d Xiao Qingyan was blocked by Xiao Jinfeng.\u201cWhat are you doing in Wind City?\u201d Xiao Qingyan asked.\u201cNothing, seeing if there\u2019s any work here.\u201d Xiao Jinfeng didn\u2019t tell the truth, Xiao Qingyan was too used to asking for money. Xiao Jingting was worried that Xiao Qingyan would ask for money if he learned their true purpose. Xiao Jinfeng originally still had some affection for Xiao Qingyan but Xiao Qingyan\u2019s few words let him lose it.\u201cYou have such a bad reputation now, it\u2019s better not to come out and appear in the public. With an attribute like yours, you won\u2019t be able to find any good jobs in the city. You might as well become a solo hunter.\u201d Xiao Qingyan said.Xiao Jinfeng nodded and said, \u201cI see.\u201d\u201cWho is he?\u201d Xiao Qingyan looked towards Mu Shuyu.\u201cIt\u2019s my wife,\u201d Xiao Jinfeng said.Xiao Qingyan glanced at Mu Shuyu and was surprised to find that the other person was actually a fourth level Qi Practitioner.Xiao Qingyan originally thought that since Xiao Jinfeng\u2019s reputation was ruined, he won\u2019t be able to find a wife and even if he did, the conditions wouldn\u2019t be too favorable. However, he didn\u2019t expect that Xiao Jinfeng would find a wife at the fourth layer of Qi Practice. When Xiao Qingyan thought deeply about it, he believed that it was just a Ger whose attributes probably weren\u2019t even very good.Xiao Qingyan glanced at Xiao Jinfeng and said, \u201cYou were able to find a wife fast enough.\u201dXiao Qingyan was originally trying to please Ouyang Jing. Ouyang Jing was the young lady of Marquis house but because she was the daughter of a concubine, she was not very valued in the Marquis family. Xiao Qingyan originally developed a good relationship with Ouyang Jing and many of his friends praised him for his ability to move a young lady of Marquis house.After Xiao Qingyan\u2019s parents died, Xiao Qingyan lost his parents\u2019 financial support and his money was tight. Then Ouyang Jing acted like a total different person, saying that he was a toad coveting swan meat. Xiao Qingyan could not afford to offend the Marquis house, so he could only greet his teeth and swallow the sorrow.Xiao Qingyan didn\u2019t stay longer, only said a few sarcastic words before he left. But long after Xiao Qingyan left, Xiao Jinfeng couldn\u2019t calm down.Mu Shuyu patted Xiao Jinfeng\u2019s shoulder and said, \u201cDon\u2019t be angry.\u201dXiao Jinfeng smiled and said, \u201cI\u2019m not angry.\u201dXiao Jinfeng originally wanted to stay in the Windy City for two more days but after meeting Xiao Qingyan, he immediately lost interest so after selling spiritual wine, he purchased some supplies and went back home.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Xiao family.\u201cSecond brother, you\u2019re back!\u201d Xiao Jingting was filled with excitement.\u201cThe harvest this time wasn\u2019t bad. I sold wine for a total of twelve thousand taels of silver. I also returned with 30 pieces of jade and bought some level 4 talismans and magic tools,\u201d Xiao Jinfeng said.Xiao Jingting nodded and said, \u201cGreat, these are exactly the things that we are lacking right now.\u201dXiao Jinfeng gave all jades to Xiao Jingting. He felt that drinking spiritual wine was much more effective than absorbing Spiritual Jade. He really did not understand why Xiao Jingting was so obsessed with the jades, \u201cSecond brother, don\u2019t you want to keep a few pieces?\u201d Xiao Jingting asked.\u201cJust leave two jars of wine for your second brother and squeeze more grape juice for your second sister-in-law,\u201d Xiao Jinfeng faintly said.Xiao Jingting nodded and said, \u201cThat is OK.\u201d\u201cBy the way, when I went out this time, I met our eldest brother,\u201d Xiao Jinfeng said.Xiao Jingting raised his head and said thoughtfully, \u201cEldest brother should be doing well. Even if he lost the protection of our parents, he is still a student of Bifeng Academy. Moreover, grandfather thinks highly of him, so he should not treat him badly.\u201d\u201cOther than being frustrated in pursuing the daughter of Marquis\u2019 \u00a0concubine, he should be doing well,\u201d Xiao Jinfeng said. After the accident of Xiao\u2019s father and mother, Xiao Qingyan\u2019s status in the academy declined a lot. However, it was still much better than Xiao Jingting and Xiao Jinfeng\u2019s previous situation where they were surrounded by enemies.\u201cDidn\u2019t Xiao Qingyan have a legitimate wife? He has a wife, and he is still chasing after the miss from Marquis family?\u201d Xiao Jingting asked.Xiao Jinfeng nodded and said, \u201cThere is one, eldest brother probably just wants to enjoy a happy and prosperous life.\u201dXiao Jingting touched his nose. Xiao Qingyan always advised the original body owner not to act too arrogantly, but as a result he was even worse. Even if she was the daughter of concubine, the Marquis household was not something that could be easily provoked.Xiao Jingting vaguely remembered that Zheng Pei\u2019er, Xiao Qingyan\u2019s wife, was a very fierce woman. This woman gave birth to two sons for Xiao Qingyan, and the original owner\u2019s parents liked those two boys so much that they were very good to Zheng Pei\u2019er. The two sons of Zheng Pei\u2019er were treated very highly in the Xiao family. But from his impression, Zheng Pei\u2019er\u2019s two sons did not have a very good relationship with his two boys.Zheng Peter\u2019s youngest son seemed to have pushed Xiao Xiaofan into the lake, and Xiao Xiaodong also fought with the two of them. But rather than fighting, Xiao Xiaodong was unilaterally beaten.After the accident of the original owner\u2019s parents, Zheng Pei\u2019er took her two children back to the Zheng family.\u201cSecond brother, did eldest brother say anything to you?\u201d Xiao Jingting asked.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He felt that I would be embarrassing him and didn\u2019t want to have anything to do with me.\u201d\u201cElder brother, I also feel that I am ignorant and embarrassing. Well, since the eldest brother doesn\u2019t want to pay attention to us, we should not ask him for anything. He is also a practitioner of fifth level, so he won\u2019t die of hunger,\u201d Xiao Jingting said cheerfully.Xiao Jinfeng nodded and said, \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cI hate big uncle.\u201d Xiao Xiaofan puffed his cheek, and said gloomily.Xiao Jinfeng looked at Xiao Xiaofan and asked, \u201cWhy do you hate big uncle?\u201d\u201cHe gave birth to two big villains, who always beat Xiaofan and brother. Grandpa is also bad, it was obvious that the villains were in the wrong but he always scolded Xiaofan.\u201d Xiao Xiaofan said melancholily.Xiao Jingting rubbed Xiao Xiaofan\u2019s head, his heart flashing with pity. Xiao Qingyan was raised as a noble prince in the Xiao family. Xiao Qingyan\u2019s two sons were spoiled and were very domineering at a very young age. In the impression of the original body owner, he seemed to bump into his two nephews bullying his sons many times, but the original body owner did not take Xiaodong and Xiaofan seriously and naturally did not protect his two sons from being bullied by them again.Thinking of what the original owner did, Xiao Jingting\u2019s heart was full of bitterness. The original owner was too bad, and his own sons did not know how to defend themselves. \u201cXiaofan, you should eat more and practice more so when you meet those two big villains again, you will be able to beat them into a meatloaf.\u201dXiao Jinfeng couldn\u2019t help smiling. He thought Xiao Jingting wanted to persuade Xiaofan not to hold grudges, but it turned out to be like this.As if inspired, Xiao Xiaofan raised his fist and said, \u201cXiaofan will grow up to be strong and will defeat those two jerks in the future.\u201d\u201cIdiot.\u201d Xiao Xiaodong said gloomily.Hearing Xiao Xiaodong\u2019s words, Xiao Xiaofan looked at Xiao Xiaodong with some frustration.\u2026\u2026\u2026Xiao Jingting went into the room and took out five glasses of water, \u201cThis is the water from 20 days ago, this from 15 days ago, this from 5 days ago and this one is from today, try it.\u201dXu Muan took a sip of the water in turn and said, \u201cThe spiritual energy is getting stronger and stronger. It seems that using Spirit Jade to enhance the quality of the spiritual spring is really working.\u201d Originally, the spirit spring water could only be useful for cultivators at third level of Qi Practice, but now it also had a considerable effect on the fourth level Qi Practitioner.Xiao Jingting sighed lightly and said, \u201cThat is right, but the cost of the spirit jade is too high.\u201dXu Muan patted Xiao Jingting on the shoulder and said, \u201cYes! However, as your strength increases, it will become easier and easier to earn money.\u201dXiao Jingting nodded and said with bright eyes, \u201cRight.\u201dXu Muan looked at Xiao Jingting and thought to himself:\u00a0This Xiao Jingting seems to be very easy to coax.\u201cI want to buy more land and connect the fields together,\u201d Xiao Jingting said.Xu Muan nodded and said, \u201cThat\u2019s good, but it will be tiring.\u201d\u201cThe chores are all done by you and second brother, so it would be fine for me to just cultivate the land,\u201d Xiao Jingting said.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Xu Muan nodded and said, \u201cFine, but if you feel tired, don\u2019t be reluctant to tell me.\u201dXiao Jingting nodded and said, \u201cI know.\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Xiao Jinfeng was full of excitement as he drank the wine, his eyes full of admiration.\u201cThe wine brewed by Jingting is really delicious, the wine I used to drink was not so mellow. Earlier, I also thought the wine from a poor village tasted good but now I can\u2019t get used to it. It seems I have a better taste now,\u201d Xiao Jinfeng shook his head.\u201cThe wine brewed by Muan has a lot of wonderful uses and has rich spiritual energy. I always feel that there is something wrong with the water used to brew this spiritual wine.\u201d Mu Shuyu said.Xiao Jinfeng waved his hand and said, \u201cA person must have some secrets. Jingting is my brother. As long as he doesn\u2019t harm me, I will do my best to help him.\u201dMu Shuyu nodded and said, \u201cPreviously, I heard rumors that your big brother was a heroic, promising young man. While your youngest brother could only drink, eat and was stupid. Only when I came into contact with him, I learned that the rumors were false. Sun Miaomiao is really blind to let go of such an excellent partner for nothing. While your big brother is nothing more than that.\u201dHis brother is bullied, and the other party did not know how to help out, but instead acted as if he was avoiding plague. How could this kind of person be trustworthy?!\u201cIsn\u2019t this good now?\u201d Xiao Jinfeng said.Mu Shuyu nodded and said, \u201cIndeed, the quality of this spiritual wine is very good. If you drink it like this for three or four months, I think you can advance to the fifth level of Qi Practice and catch up with your big brother. It is time to find a formula to conceal your cultivation. If you advance to fifth level, you will attract unwanted attention.\u201dXiao Jinfeng nodded and said, \u201cI know. I have this formula.\u201dMu Shuyu was surprised as he said, \u201cYou have it? That\u2019s great! It will save us some silver.\u201dXiao Jinfeng smiled. In the Wasteland Continent, strength was respected so there were very few people who would hide their cultivation. The Hidden Qi Technique was rarely practiced, so this was just perfect for them to practice.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Because of the Hidden Qi Technique, other people thought that the cultivation of the Xiao family stayed on the fourth level of Qi practice.Mu Shuyu gave birth to a little Ger son two months ago and named him Xiao Xiaofu.Xiao Jingting had earned a lot of silver and bought a lot of land in the past half year. The villagers only thought that Xiao Jingting made a lot of money from selling spiritual plants, but they didn\u2019t know that Xiao Jingting made less than a tenth of the money he made from selling spiritual plants and the rest from wine.Every once in a while, Xiao Jinfeng went out to sell wine and purchased a batch of cultivation supplies along the way.Xiao Jingting threw the dozens of spiritual jades that he had just got into spiritual spring.Xu Muan who just walked into the door, looked at Xiao Jingting and said, \u201cHas all the spiritual jade been thrown in it?\u201dXiao Jingting nodded and said with some pain, \u201cYes! The ones that just arrived all went down the drain again.\u201d Spiritual Spring really costed much money! In the past half a year, several hundred pieces of spiritual jades had been thrown into it.Xu Muan smiled, cultivation meant burning resources. If advancement was so easy, there wouldn\u2019t be so many people who would spend their entire lives at the second and third levels of Qi Practice.\u201cDon\u2019t feel bad, as long as the Harvest Sparrow Orchid by the Spiritual Spring can grow, these\u00a0spiritual jades are nothing,\u201d Xu Muan said.Xiao Jingting nodded his head and said, \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d The Harvest Sparrow Orchid was miraculous medicine that could help cultivators at the fifth level of Qi Practice advance to the sixth level. Xu Muan had a hard time buying seeds for this spiritual plant.\u201cWhere\u2019s Xiaodong?\u201d Xiao Jingting asked.\u201cHe became very diligent recently, he\u00a0must have gone to the field.\u201d Xu Muan said.Xiao Xiaodong entered the second level of Qi Practice two month ago. Even in large families, children that were not yet 5 years old advancing to the second level of Qi practice were not common. But it had never happened in the village before, so Xiao Xiaodong\u2019s advancement had caused quite a stir. As early as five or six months ago, Xiao Jingting bought a safe piece of land not far away from home and gave it to Xiao Xiaodong to take care of.Xiao Jingting smiled and said, \u201cOur son is so motivated, he will have great achievements in the future.\u201dXu Muan smiled, soft light flashing in his eyes, \u201cI hope so.\u201d\u2026\u2026A huge fire bird flew through the air, making many villagers stop what they were doing and stare.Xiao Jingting had spent a thousand taels of silver on a third level Fire Cloud Bird more than half a year ago. He bought one and got one free, receiving a first level Fire Cloud Bird chick. The third level Fire Cloud Bird was used by Xiao Jingting while the first level demonic beast was given to Xiao Xiaodong and Xiao Xiaofan to play with.\u201cThis Fire Cloud Bird of the Xiao family is growing so fast! It\u2019s not the same as yesterday.\u201d\u201cThe food in Xiao family is really good! Look at this Fire Cloud Bird raised by them. Its feathers are so glossy and shiny!\u201d\u201cXiao Jingting is too bold to give such a big bird to two children to play with.\u201d\u201cThis Fire Cloud Bird was bought from the Imperial Beast Hall, with the Imperial Beast Talisman. Although it cost several times the price, with the Imperial Beast Talisman to control it, it is much easier to control than an ordinary demonic beast.\u201d\u201cXiao Xiaodong is no ordinary child! At such a young age, he is already at the second level of Qi Practice, how can other little kids from the village compare with him?\u201d\u201cHow much money does the Xiao family have, anyway!? They earn thousands of taels by selling crops from fields once.\u201d\u2026\u2026Xiao Xiaofan sat on the Fire Cloud Bird\u2019s back, eating steamed stuffed buns.\u201cStop eating,\u201d Xiao Xiaodong said with a cold face.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Xiao Xiaofan looked at Xiao Xiaodong and asked, \u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cThe little Cloud Bird has been crying hungrily, and can\u2019t even fly properly anymore,\u201d Xiao Xiaodong said.\u201cThen I\u2019ll give it one to eat.\u201d The Fire Cloud Bird excitedly held the steamed stuffed bun thrown to him by Xiao Xiaofan.In the process of holding steamed buns, its body trembled violently, and Xiao Xiaodong, who was sitting on the Fire Cloud Bird, had a hard time stabilizing himself.\u201cYou idiot, I knew I should not bring you out.\u201d Xiao Xiaodong angrily scolded.\u201cBrother, don\u2019t say that. I can help too.\u201d Xiao Xiaofan argued.Xiao Xiaodong was full of disdain, \u201cHelp? What help, help me with eating?\u201dXiao Xiaofan was filled with reluctance, \u201cNo, I can help you fight the demon beasts.\u201dXiao Xiaodong snorted coldly and said, \u201cJust don\u2019t make trouble and start fighting with demonic beasts.\u201d\u2026\u2026Qiu Bai raised his head and looked at the Fire Cloud Bird flying in the sky with his heart filled with jealousy.After marrying into the Li family, Qiu Bai realized that life in the big family was not easy.Qiu Bai\u2019s husband had a very domineering wife, who set rules for Qiu Bai at every turn. His husband had several concubines, but when he first entered the Li family, he was favored for a period of time. However, after a few days, Qiu Bai\u2019s life became very difficult.Sometimes, Qiu Bai would hate his father who asked him to become a concubine for two pieces of spiritual jade. But after hating him, Qiu Bai could only continue to live his hard life.Qiu Bai came back this time because Qiu Li went hunting in the mountains, but was chased by a demonic beast and fell down from the mountain.\u201cMaster, it\u2019s getting late, let\u2019s go back to the town early,\u201d The maid beside Qiu Bai said.Qiu Bai nodded and said, \u201cAll right.\u201d When he got home, his father would only complain about him. That he was incapable of winning his husband\u2019s heart and was ungrateful. He also didn\u2019t know how to help his family. Wearing expensive clothes and jewelry by himself while not caring about life and death of his family.Qiu Bai smiled bitterly, his father couldn\u2019t see all his hardships, all he could think about was his brother.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Although he gave birth to a little Ger son, Xiao Jinfeng loved this son very much, which made Mu Shuyu very happy.\u201cYou have been drinking again and you reek of wine. Your son is going to dislike you,\u201d Mu Shuyu complained with a smile.\u201cHow can I be blamed for this? I can only blame Muan for making better wine, it\u2019s strangely comfortable to drink,\u201d Xiao Jinfeng said.Mu Shuyu nodded and said, \u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201dThe best wine brewed at home was reserved for the family to drink, and the wine sold was what they didn\u2019t drink. It was these abandoned wines that caused a huge stir in the Windy City and the reason their family could advance so quickly was because they often drank this spiritual wine.\u201cLet me hold him for a while.\u201d Xiao Jinfeng stretched out his hand towards Mu Shuyu.Mu Shuyu handed the baby in his hand to Xiao Jinfeng.\u201cXiaofu is so cute! His nose looks just like mine.\u201d\u00a0Xiao Jinfeng was\u00a0full of smiles.Mu Shuyu looked at Xiao Jinfeng and said, \u201cI hope that when he grows up, he won\u2019t be an alcoholic like you.\u201dXiao Jinfeng smiled awkwardly.Xiao Xiaofu leaned towards Xiao Jinfeng\u2019s mouth and sniffed gently. Xiao Jinfeng said somewhat proudly, \u201cMy body smells good, that\u2019s why our son likes it very much!\u201dXiao Xiaofu smacked Xiao Jinfeng\u2019s face and Mu Shuyu laughed, saying \u201cYes! He likes you, he likes beating you.\u201dXiao Jinfeng and Mu Shuyu were joking at home when the sound of roaring Jioma came in.\u201cWhere\u2019s the sound of horses coming from?\u201d Xiao Jinfeng was confused. Jioma was a demonic beast raised mostly in big families, so there should be no such beast in small towns.Xiao Jinfeng walked out of the door and looked at the visitors. He was surprised to find that it was an acquaintance, \u201cSteward Xiao San, why are you here?\u201d\u201cYoung Master Jinfeng. I\u2019m here to welcome you and Young Master Jingting back to the Xiao family on the order of the Second Master.\u201d\u201cSecond master, my father?\u201d Xiao Jinfeng\u2019s eyes widened with surprise.\u2026\u2026The news that the Xiao family had distinguished guests at their door spread throughout the Mound Village in no time.\u201cMother and father are actually still alive,\u201d Xiao Jingting was very surprised.It had been almost a year since Xiao Jingting had been sent to Mound Village and from Xiao Ping\u2019s occasional letters, he learned that Xiao family had a lot of internal strife in the recent year. The four great families of Desert City were also in constant dispute, so he and Xiao Jinfeng who were expelled from the family, had basically been completely forgotten.The original body owner\u2019s parents went out with a friend to do a mission and as result, they were plotted against by their friends and fell off the cliff. The person who did the mission with the original body owner\u2019s parents came back and claimed that the parents of the original body owner had met with misfortune, and everyone believed it.As a result, after almost a year, the original body owner\u2019s parents came back again. It seemed that the original body owner\u2019s parents met some opportunities at the bottom of the cliff and their cultivation entered into eighth level of Qi Practice.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.At present, the highest-level cultivator in the Xiao family was the old man at ninth level of Qi Practice. The original body owner\u2019s parents were much younger than this old man, so it was only a matter of time before they would advance to the ninth level of Qi Practice.When the parents of the original body owner returned, they became furious when they learned that their eldest son had been ostracized in the academy, their second son had become a target of public criticism, and the youngest son was expelled from the Xiao family.Perhaps in order to stand out for Xiao Jinfeng, as soon as the original body owner\u2019s parents came back, they whipped Xiao Muhong\u2019s concubine, Feng Xue\u2019er, to death in public. The reason was that Feng Xue\u2019er had bad intentions, and dared to seduce the second young master of the Xiao family, was lustful and of lowly nature who also liked to speak nonsense and slander the second young master.It was said that when the original body owner\u2019s mother did it, Xiao Muhong stood right beside her and didn\u2019t dare to say a word.Xiao Jingting secretly shook his head, the so-called truth was always nothing more than something written by the victor. During this period of time, the Xiao family has been fighting endlessly, and as soon as the original body owner\u2019s parents come back, the power in the family had to be changed again.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Xiao Xiaofan laid down on the table and said weakly, \u201cI don\u2019t want to go back.\u201dFor Xiao Xiaofan, the Xiao family was really not a good place. In the Xiao family, children of the same age always bullied Xiao Xiaofan, and he could only eat what was left over from other people\u2019s meals. Xu Muan, who was afraid of Xiao Xiaofan being bullied, would often lock up Xiao Xiaofan and Xiao Xiaodong.Xiao Xiaodong lowered his head, he also did not want to go back. The Mound village might not be as prosperous as the Xiao family, but he was free. Xiao Xiaodong only felt that the recent days were prosperous and fulfilling compared to the past, and the Xiao family was full of intrigues and tricks. Xiao Xiaodong had no good feelings for such places at all.\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t Xiaofan want to go back?\u201d Xiao Jinfeng asked gently.Xiao Xiaofan\u2019s small hands supported his chin as he said in a tone full of frustration, \u201cThere are a lot of bad people over there who want to beat up Xiaofan.\u201dXiao Jingting rubbed Xiao Xiaofan\u2019s head and said, \u201cYou can fight back!\u201d\u201cXiaofan can\u2019t beat them.\u201d Xiao Xiaofan hung his head dejectedly.\u201cDaddy will help you,\u201d Xiao Jingting said.Hearing Xiao Jingting\u2019s words, Xiao Xiaofan\u2019s eyes lit up.Xu Muan gave Xiao Jingting a helpless look.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was very difficult for common people to advance to fifth level after becoming Qi Practitioner of forth level. All secrets were monopolized by the big families, making it difficult for outsiders to access them.Xiao Jingting nodded and said, \u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d The children of Xiao family can only get in touch with a cultivation technique that is one level higher than their own. Xiao Jingting\u2019s fifth level cultivation technique was passed down by Xiao Jinfeng, without it, it would have been impossible to advance.\u201cHas big uncle gone back?\u201d Xiao Xiaofan asked.\u201cYes, he has.\u201d Xiao Qingyan was originally very unhappy in the academy, because of his failed pursuit of the Miss from Marquis family, Zheng Pei\u2019er consciously lost face and wanted to get away from Xiao Qingyan. After the original body owner\u2019s parents came back, Zheng Pei\u2019er immediately didn\u2019t dare to mention it anymore.Xiao Xiaofan bulged his cheek and said with anxiety, \u201cXiaofan hates big uncle very much!\u201dMu Shuyu looked at Xiao Xiaofan and said, \u201cWhy does Xiaofan hate big uncle?\u201d\u201cUncle scolded Xiaofan for being an idiot and uncle gave birth to two nuisances.\u201d Xiao Xiaofan held his chin up, full of disgust.Mu Shuyu smiled. He also hated Xiao Qingyan, but it was hard to say it blantly.Xu Muan looked at his two children and felt a bit sorry for them. Xiao Jingting looked at Xiao Xiaofan and Xiao Xiaodong and said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t have a good time in the Xiao family, we can get an independent yard.\u201dXiao Xiaofan\u2019s eyes immediately lit up at his words.Xiao Jingting didn\u2019t like the Xiao family very much, but he wanted to visit the Desert City. Mound Village was after all too small and limited their development, so Xiao Jingting still had some yearning for the big city.\u201cThen let\u2019s prepare well, before we return to the Xiao family,\u201d Xu Muan said.Xiao Jingting nodded and said, \u201cYes, I want to sell the fields.\u201d Especially those mus of high class fields, the fees for this damn fine was really too terrible.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201cWhere are we staying tonight, steward Xiao?\u201d One of Xiao San\u2019s attendants came up and asked.\u201cYoung Master, let\u2019s go to the city and find an inn to stay at,\u201d Xiao San said.When Xiao San first came to Mound Village, he thought that Xiao Jingting and Xiao Jinfeng led very depressing lives and would be overjoyed to see them come and would leave with them without saying a word. After they arrived, he realized that this was not the case at all.When the villagers mentioned the two young masters, they were full of envy, jealousy and admiration. It was said that a few mus of field planted by Xiao Jingting earned five or six thousand taels of silver every month, making their life in a small village very good.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Five or six thousand taels a month, which translated to more than twenty pieces of spiritual jade. Even the favored young master of the Xiao family would only be given two or three pieces of spiritual jade a month.The dry and skinny young masters Xiao Xiaodong and Xiao Xiaofan who were raised in Xiao family become chubby and fair-skinned in the village.Xiao Jinfeng was also married, far from what people thought that after being rejected by Miss Sun Miao yin, he became depressed and completely lost heart in everything. He was not only married but also had a child.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect that young master Jingting after coming to Mound Village would work hard and become stronger,\u201d An attendant said.Xiao San nodded his head and said,\u201dThat\u2019s right.\u201dAccording to the villagers, Xiao Jingting, Xiao Jinfeng, Xu Muan and even Mu Shuyu were all in the fourth level of Qi Practice. The outstanding members of the Xiao family were all at the fourth level of Qi Practice and Xiao Jingting was originally at the bottom of the family, his cultivation progressing mostly thanks to elixirs.When Xiao Jingting and Xiao Jinfeng return to the Xiao family, they will certainly be able to impress the others with their new abilities.Mu Shuyu was holding the child and circling around Xiao Jinfeng.\u201cShuyu, what\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d Xiao Jinfeng asked.\u201cI\u2019m going to meet your parents soon, so I\u2019m a little worried if your parents will like our son.\u201d Mu Shuyu said.Mu Shuyu had never met Xiao Jinfeng\u2019s parents, so he was a little nervous. These days, he had learned from Xu Muan, however, Xu Muan himself was not liked by Xiao\u2019s mother and father. If it were not for Xiao Jingting\u2019s bad old habits, and being unable to find a suitable person, Xu Muan might already be dismissed a long time ago.Xiao Jinfeng lowered his head and said stiffly, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry too much, my parents care the most about my elder brother and never cared too much about me. If you don\u2019t get used to living in Xiao family house, we will move to another courtyard once I\u2019ve got a cultivation technique for the sixth level.Mu Shuyu nodded and said, \u201cAll right.\u201dXiao Jinfeng lowered his head and thought to himself:\u00a0That big brother of his is actually an extremely jealous person. Knowing that both him and Xiao Jingting advanced to fifth level of Qi Practice, he will only be able to accept it. His Hidden Qi Technique was not good enough. It could deceive ordinary villagers but it would be difficult to deceive his parents who are at eighth level of Qi Practice and his grandfather who was on ninth level. After going back, it would be better to avoid Xiao Qingyan as much as possible.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Xiao Jingting also said that this batch is not for sale and asked you to remember to put it away.\u201dXiao Jinfeng raised his eyebrows and said with some joy, \u201cStill, Jingting is good enough!\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026The big house of the Xiao family.Xiao Muhong sat on the side drinking wine, \u201cStop drinking.\u201d Sun Xiaomiao came over and said.Xiao Muhong lowered his head, his eyes gloomy. As soon as Xiao Linfeng came back, everything changed, and Grandpa\u2019s eyes were on second uncle\u2019s house.His father, third and fourth uncles who were originally making a lot of trouble were forced to unite again.\u201cXiao Jingting is coming back, do you regret it?\u201d Xiao Muhong looked at Sun Xiaomiao and asked.Sun Xiaomiao coldly said, \u201cIf you continue to be so self-destructive, then I will really regret it. Don\u2019t be so unambitious. Your second uncle is only just level eight Qi Practitioner. You have already cultivated to level five, so just try harder and at your uncle\u2019s age, you will also have a chance to become level eight Qi Practitioner.\u201d\u201cXiao Qingyan from the second uncle\u2019s house seemed to have conflict with someone from the academy and seemed to have injured his meridians, so his cultivation progressed very slowly. Xiao Jinfeng has been poisoned and his future achievements are limited and Xiao Jingting doesn\u2019t even need to be mentioned. The time is still long, Xiao family still might be yours.\u201dA light flashed in Xiao Muhong\u2019s eyes.Seeing Xiao Muhong cheer up, Sun Xiaomiao secretly breathed a sigh of relief. After the news of Xiao Linfeng coming back from death, Sun Xiaomiao actually regretted marrying Xiao Muhong in a hurry. However, she was already married and could not go back.Thinking of Xiao Jingting, Sun Xiaomiao\u2019s heart suddenly became a little more complicated. Before, Xiao Jingting had been circling around her, and didn\u2019t know what was happening around him. If Xiao Jingting\u2019s affection for her had not changed, maybe that idiot would be a good chess piece.\u2026\u2026\u201cFather, mother, it\u2019s a good thing you\u2019re alive. During this period of time, I was almost suffocated to death. Zheng Pei\u2019er, that bitch seeing that I was weakened unexpectedly wanted to divorce me. I am going to stop her\u2026\u201d As soon as Xiao Linfeng and Wang Lu came back, Xiao Qingyan seemed to have found a backer and told them all his grievances.Xiao Linfeng looked at Xiao Qingyan, who kept complaining, and said earnestly, \u201cYou are not young anymore, it\u2019s time for you to learn to be on your own.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s going on with you and that lady from the marquis\u2019 household? You already have a wife but you\u2019re still messing with a lady from the marquis household? If the marquis learns about it, you will not be able to get away with it,\u201d Wang Lu saidXiao Qingyan said, \u201cI naturally would not dare to chase the legitimate daughter of the marquis house. I chased a concubine\u2019s daughter. When I was at the academy, she also showed interest in me, but\u2026 A bitch gives birth to a bitch, and she suddenly changed.\u201dXiao Linfeng sighed and said, \u201cYou\u2019d better stay away from that girl, as soon as I came back, everything changed. Your second brother was expelled from the mercenary team and it is said that he coveted his cousin\u2019s wife. Sun Miaoyin of the Sun family also broke off her engagement with your brother and it was Old Man Sun himself who came over to ask for this marriage. I didn\u2019t expect him to change his face so quickly.\u201dVisit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201cYour second brother was in trouble, why didn\u2019t you help him? You are brothers, in future if you are not in power knowing your second brother\u2019s temper, he would\u00a0certainly help you.\u201d Wang Lu\u00a0saidXiao Linfeng nodded and said, \u201cYes! It\u2019s hard to stand alone.\u201dHearing them mention Xiao Jinfeng, Xiao Qingyan felt a little uncomfortable. Xiao Jinfeng\u2019s reputation was terrible. When they got the chance, those students in the academy used Xiao Jinfeng to satirize him, so Xiao Qingyan was already annoyed and wished he didn\u2019t have such a brother.Xiao Qingyan secretly thought to himself:\u00a0Xiao Jinfeng was just a reckless man, moreover, he was poisoned and it was estimated that he will only be a level fourth Qi Practitioner in this life. If he expected Xiao Jinfeng to help him, he was afraid he may only\u00a0have to suffer from cold and hunger.\u201cYour second brother and third brother are actually together now. I didn\u2019t know that they had such a good relationship in the past. Your third brother was spoiled since childhood and was sent to such a place. I am afraid he has suffered a lot. When they come back, you brothers should get along well.\u201d Wang Lu said.Xiao Qingyan nodded, but what he thought was that his third brother was a hopeless good-for-nothing. All he knew was following women around. Since Sun Xiaomiao became his cousin\u2019s wife, he might revolve around his cousin\u2019s wife and do some immoral things. In that circumstance, getting along well with his third younger brother, his reputation might become ruined.When Xiao Qingyan walked out, Zheng Pei\u2019er stood at the door with her two sons, looking at Xiao Qingyan with an embarrassed smile.Xiao Qingyan snorted coldly. After the death of his parents, Zheng Pei\u2019er despised him in every aspect, causing Xiao Qingyan to become a little upset with Zheng Pei\u2019er.Xiao Qingyan\u2019s two sons, Xiao Yuefeng and Xiao Yuerong, ran to Xiao Qingyan to be pampered. Xiao Qingyan was dissatisfied with Zheng Pei\u2019er, but he was still good to his two sons he loved since childhood. His face finally softened a bit when he saw his two sons acting coquettish around him.\u201cDad, I heard that the little fool is coming back, is he?\u201d Xiao Yuerong asked.Xiao Qingyan nodded and said, \u201cYes!\u201d\u201cWhat a tough life this little fool has! Sent to a place like that but still able to survive. \u201d Xiao Yuerong curled his lips.Xiao Qingyan touched Xiao Yurong\u2019s face and said, \u201cIt seems you don\u2019t like at all.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s dirty and stupid.

Xiao Xiaodong\u00a0hurriedly covered his nose and Xiao Xiaofan triumphantly added, \u201cStink him to death.\u201dXiao Xiaodong\u2019s face darkened as he said, \u201cYou will stink me to death before you stink him to death.\u201dXiao Xiaofan looked at Xiao Xiaodong, tilted his head, and said, \u201cBig brother, you\u2019re afraid of the stink.\u201dXiao Xiaodong\u2019s face darkened even more as he thought to himself:\u00a0Idiot! He was an ordinary person. Of course he was afraid of stink.Xiao Xiaofan took out a box of stinky tofu from his storage bag and Xiao Xiaodong finally couldn\u2019t bear it any longer and jumped out of the carriage, saying he wanted to change the carriage.\u2026\u2026Xiao Jingting looked out of the window nervously.\u201cYou\u2019re nervous!\u201d Xu Muan said.Xiao Jingting nodded and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to see my parents. Of course I\u2019m a little nervous.\u201dXu Muan understood that Xiao Jingting was worried that his identity as an outsider would be discovered by the parents of the original body owner. Xu Muan grabbed Xiao Jingting\u2019s hand and said, \u201cIn fact your parents often go out and leave you in care of the family servants.\u201dXiao Jingting nodded and said, \u201cYes! The person my parents care\u00a0the most is the eldest brother.\u201dIf Xiao Qingyan had changed, the parents of the original body owner might have noticed but if it was Xiao Jingting, the probability would have been greatly reduced.A guard sent Xiao Xiaodong to the carriage of Xiao Jingting and Xu Muan.\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d Xu Muan asked.\u201cMy brother ate garlic, and now he is eating stinky tofu. His whole body stinks badly.\u201d Xiao Xiaodong was very depressed.\u201cXiaofan? Why does he suddenly want to eat those things?\u201d Xiao Jingting thought it was a bit strange. He only knew that Xiao Xiaofan liked to eat sweets. He could eat more than ten sweet bean buns at time.\u201cHe said he wanted to stink Xiao Yurong to death,\u201d Xiao Xiaodong said.Xiao Jingting\u2019s face sank, secretly thinking:\u00a0Xiao Yuerong gave Xiao Xiaofan such a big trauma in mind! So much so that when he thought of going home, Xiao Xiaofan behaved like he was about to face his greatest enemy. If they go back, the two children will inevitably meet. The parents of the original body owner were very fond of Xiao Qingyan\u2019s two sons but were not very good to the original body owner\u2019s sons.Xiao Jingting stroked his chin and thought that after he went home, he should try his best to avoid meeting Xiao Qingyan!\u2026\u2026\u2026Xiao Jinfeng looked at the scenery outside the window and sighed.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Mu Shuyu asked.Xiao Jinfeng shook his head and said, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, I just thought that after I go back, I might meet some acquaintances. I don\u2019t know how the mercenary team has developed now.\u201dWhen he had just been expelled from the mercenary team, Xiao Jinfeng was filled with resentment towards the mercenary team. But when his days became better, coupled with the company of a lovely wife and son, Xiao Jinfeng\u2019s hatred towards the mercenary team had diluted a lot.Mu Shuyu laughed coldly, full of sarcasm. \u201cHua Yufeng is greedy and reckless. He always felt that your cautious behavior limited the development of the mercenary team, so when he finally kicked you out of the mercenary team, he would have a chance to make great plans.\u201d\u201cWhen the old team captain died unexpectedly, he asked me to help Hua Yufeng. He said that Hua Yufeng was a bit rash and asked me to help admonish him,\u201d Xiao Jinfeng said.Mu Shuyu shrugged and said, \u201cThis patch was their own choice, you have already done everything you could.\u201dVisit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Xiao Jinfeng closed his eyes and said, \u201cYes! Since I am already expelled from the mercenary team, I should have nothing to do with them.\u201dMu Shuyu lowered his head, in fact he secretly inquired about the current situation of the mercenary team. He heard that the mercenary team had failed several missions in a row and suffered heavy losses, reaching the brink of disbanding. Because he knew the temperament of Hua Tianyu, Mu Shuyu was not surprised by this result.Knowing the situation of the mercenary team, Mu Shuyu did not sympathize with them at all but gloated.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026In Desert City\u2019s Moonlight Restaurant, several mercenaries gathered together.\u201cXiao Linfeng came back and reorganized the Xiao family and it seems the deputy captain is about to be brought back.\u201d The one who spoke was Zhang Meng from the fox hunting mercenary team.\u201cIt\u2019s been almost a year, so we don\u2019t know deputy captain\u2019s strength now.\u201d Zhou Fang sighed.Zhang Meng bowed his head. After the mercenary team had been forced to fire Xiao Jinfeng under pressure, Xiao Jinfeng had become a taboo subject in the mercenary group.Xiao Jinfeng was a generous person, but he acted cautiously. After he left the mercenary team, Hua Yufeng was so eager for success that he led his men to besiege a level five demonic beast and suffered heavy losses from the demonic beast\u2019s fierce attack.Before that mission, the mercenary team had also dealt with a level five demonic beast, but it was wounded. Moreover, Xiao Jinfeng was also there at that time and after Xiao Jinfeng left, the strength of the mercenary team decreased a lot.After the failure of the operation, Hua Yufeng\u2019s prestige was greatly diminished, so in order to recover his lost reputation, Hua Yufeng arranged a dangerous mission once again and suffered a big defeat.The two failed operations caused the mercenary team\u2019s strength to be greatly reduced, which was far from its former glory.\u201cEven if the deputy captain comes back, he will not return to the mercenary team,\u201d Zhou Fang said. The mercenary team was all made from the commanders, so they all had vague rejection of Xiao Jinfeng. But after Xiao Jinfeng left, the mercenaries gradually missed Xiao Jinfeng\u2019s kindness.\u201cWe don\u2019t know how the deputy captain was doing these days.\u201dZhang Meng sighed and said, \u201cWhen the deputy captain left, doctor Mu also left. I heard that the deputy captain and doctor Mu got married and they went to live with the deputy captain\u2019s younger brother.\u201d\u201cAssemble.\u201d Zhao Li walked into the restaurant and said.Zhang Meng frowned and said, \u201cAssemble? Do we have another mission?\u201dZhao Li nodded his head and said, \u201cYes!\u201d\u201cBut now, there are still a lot of people who were injured previously, isn\u2019t it too hasty to go on the mission now?\u201d Zhou Fang asked.Zhao Li frowned and said, \u201cIt has been a long time since we did any mission. If we go on like this, the mercenary team will be out of business.\u201dZhou Fang sighed lightly and said, \u201cAll right.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The fate of these two scourges is really tough. That fierce bitch Wang Lu gave me a fierce look all day long. If I wasn\u2019t Miss Sun of the Sun family, she might have already whipped me to death.\u201d Sun Xiaomiao was full of anger.Wang Lu was actually so arrogant that she beat Xiao Muhong\u2019s concubine to death in public. Although she herself didn\u2019t like that Feng Xue\u2019er, she still felt some resentment in her heart to see people being beaten to death.Because Xiao Jingting had pursued Sun Xiaomiao before and she did not explicitly refuse and later still married Xiao Muhong, Wang Lu had a very bad impression of Sun Xiaomiao.\u201cIt was a bit wrong of you to marry Xiao Muhong. I thought Xiao Muhong would be in charge.\u201d Sun Miaoyin frowned.Sun Xiaomiao sighed and said, \u201cI\u2019ve already married, and it\u2019s too late to talk about this now.\u201d\u201cThe path of cultivation is full of variables, just because Xiao Linfeng and Wang Lu escaped this time, doesn\u2019t mean that they will escape next time. Just watch,\u201d Sun Miaoyin comforted her.\u201cSister, you\u2019ll be all right. You\u2019ve been married to Zhou Kang who is a genius and already at sixth level of Qi Practice. He might even be able to become a foundation stage cultivator in future.\u201d Sun Xiaomiao was envious.Sun Miaoyin waved her hand and said, \u201cIt\u2019s still too early to talk about foundation stage. But with Zhou Kang\u2019s ability, reaching ninth level of Qi Practice should be a given.\u201dSun Miaoyin\u2019s tone was light and shallow, but her eyes flashed with some pride.Sun Xiaomiao looked at Sun Miaoyin with some envy. \u201cSister, Wang Lu has brought Xiao Jingting and Xiao Jinfeng back. You had a marriage contract with Xiao Jinfeng before. Do you think Xiao Jinfeng will hold a grudge against you for breaking the contract?\u201d\u201cDragons don\u2019t live with snakes. He and I are not destined to be together; he should understand that.\u201d Sun Miaoyin lifted the cup of tea and took a sip of tea in a haughty manner.Sun Xiaomiao nodded and said, \u201cThat\u2019s right. How can a reckless man like Xiao Jinfeng be worthy of you?! When he was expelled from the mercenary team, he was poisoned. Even if he was detoxified, there is still a hidden danger and he will be stuck at the fourth level of Qi Practice for the rest of his life, so he could only be somebody in the countryside.\u201dSun Miaoyin\u2019s slender fingers held her chin as she smiled slightly. \u201cDon\u2019t even mention him, just mentioning him put me in a bad mood. Xiao Jingting is also coming back, when facing you, he always looked like a grandson who performed filial piety.\u201dSun Xiaomiao blushed and said, \u201cI\u2019m his sister-in-law now. I guess he won\u2019t dare to do anything now.\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Zhou Kang walked into Sun Miaoyin\u2019s bedroom. \u201cHas your sister been here?\u201dSun Miaoyin nodded and said, \u201cYes! She didn\u2019t expect that Xiao Linfeng and Wang Lu were still alive, so her situation right now is not so good.\u201dZhou Kang narrowed his eyes, his face slightly darkened. \u201cXiao Linfeng and his wife have really tough (tough as in tenacious. That they didn\u2019t die is a proof of their tenacity) lives.\u201d The four big families of Desert City competed with each other. The Xiao family suddenly having two more level eight Qi Practitioners was a big blow to other families.\u201cI heard that Xiao Linfeng was going to bring Xiao Jinfeng and Xiao Jingting back. I thought that Xiao Jinfeng had no chance of coming back, so I let him go. But I didn\u2019t expect this guy who was nearly dying, not only survived, but also returned to the Desert City.\u201d Zhou Kang said.Sun Miaoyin lowered her head and said, \u201cAnyway he is only at fourth level of Qi Practice, which is nothing. His influence on you is limited, so you don\u2019t need to worry about such a small person.\u201dVisit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Zhou Kang said surly, \u201cIf he was an ordinary person, I wouldn\u2019t mind, but he had a marriage contract with you! Just thinking that he once had a relationship with you makes me want to kill him.\u201dSun Miaoyin glanced at Zhou Kang and said, \u201cBe careful.\u201dZhou Kang suddenly hugged Sun Miaoyin, and the two smiled at each other before rolling into the bed.\u2026\u2026Zheng Pei\u2019er urged her eldest son to get up while helping her younger son get dressed.\u201cMother, why do we have to get up so early!\u201d Xiao Yuerong bulged his cheek with dissatisfaction.\u201cToday, your two uncles are coming back, so you need to get up and\u00a0greet them.\u201d Zheng Pei\u2019er said.Xiao Yuerong snorted and said, \u201cIt\u2019s just two loser uncles coming back. What\u2019s the big deal?\u201dZheng Pei\u2019er frowned and said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense.\u201d\u201cBrother didn\u2019t talk nonsense! That\u2019s what father said too. I don\u2019t know what grandfather and grandma are picking them up for.\u00a0The second uncle has a poor reputation, and the third uncle is the black sheep of the family. He was\u00a0never able to achieve, but always able to ruin,\u201d Xiao Yuefeng\u00a0was full of disdain.Zheng Pei\u2019er glanced at her eldest son and warned him. \u201cNo matter how bad your two uncles are, they are also the sons of your grandparents. Don\u2019t talk nonsense when you are in front of your grandparents.\u201dXiao Yuefeng nodded earnestly and said, \u201cMother, don\u2019t worry about it. I still have a sense of propriety.\u201d\u201cLater on, when you are in front of your grandparents, be a little sweeter in the way you talk.\u201d Zheng Pei\u2019er said.Xiao Yuefeng nodded and said, \u201cI know, Grandpa and Grandma like me. I am not the same as Xu Muan\u2019s two little brats.\u201d\u201cMother, will the fool come back?\u201d Xiao Yuerong asked.Zheng Pei\u2019er nodded and said, \u201cHe will.\u201dXiao Yuerong tilted his head and said triumphantly, \u201cI don\u2019t know how savage looking he grew up in the countryside.

Liu Xian, that bitch, only gave your brother so little silver, how could your brother get used to it?!\u201dWang Lu\u2019s face was gloomy. When she came back and heard what the first house had done, Wang Lu wanted to bring them down. However, the other houses reacted quickly and immediately put aside their past grievances. When the old man came out to play peacemaker, Wang Lu could only suppress the anger in her heart.Xiao Qingyan bowed his head and thought to himself:\u00a0With Xiao Jingting\u2019s personality, it was fine to throw him out to suffer a little criticism. But in front of Wang Lu, Xiao Qingyan didn\u2019t dare to say this. Wang Lu didn\u2019t like Xiao Jinfeng very much,\u00a0but she loved Xiao Jingting very much. Because most of the family\u2019s resources were given to him, Wang Lu always felt that she had mistreated Xiao Jingting and felt somewhat guilty towards him.Xiao Hefeng came out and looked at Xiao Linfeng and Wang Lu, saying, \u201cSecond brother, second sister-in-law, are you waiting someone?! The sun is already so hot, so why don\u2019t you come inside and wait there? It\u2019s too tiring to wait here!\u201dWang Lu waved her hand and coldly said, \u201cNo need.\u201dWang Lu was most dissatisfied with the first house. However, she also didn\u2019t have good feelings for those who became two cold-eyed onlookers when her sons were in trouble. But no matter what they thought in their hearts, on the surface these people still put on the appearance of brotherhood and friendship.\u2026\u2026Xiao Chengfeng looked at Liu Xian and said, \u201cYou\u2019re not going out?\u201dLiu Xian snorted coldly and said, \u201cTwo juniors, do they need a bunch of elders to greet them? Anyway, those two hold a grudge against me, so I don\u2019t need to do anything superficial.\u201d\u201cI heard that Xiao Jingting was doing well in the Mound Village.\u201d Xiao Chengfeng said.\u201cYou must be mistaken, how could this loser be actually doing well outside?\u201d Liu Xian said.Xiao Chengfeng squinted his eyes and said, \u201cThere should be no mistake. He really changed.\u201dLiu Xian gritted her teeth and said, \u201cOne Xiao Qingyan is tricky enough, if Xiao Jingting has changed his nature and joined forces with him, it will be troublesome.\u201dXiao Chengfeng was unconcerned, \u201cDon\u2019t be so pessimistic. Xiao Qingyan is not a person who can accommodate people and Xiao Jingting is also a competitive one. These three monks will have no water to drink. When Xiao Jingting comes back, whether he will unite with Xiao Qingyan, or two brothers will fight against each other, it\u2019s still not clear.\u201dLiu Xian\u2019s face changed and then a bright smile was revealed. \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u2026\u2026In the restaurant.Sun Hao sat by the side of the road and looked at it from time to time.\u201cSun Hao, what are you doing?\u201d\u201cToday, Xiao Jingting and Xiao Jinfeng of the Xiao family are coming back. They should be here soon.\u201d\u201cThat guy Xiao Jingting is bad enough, a rich young master sent to that kind of place. It is said that women in the countryside are black, thin, dry and shriveled, so after three years in the countryside, a man might find ugly girls prettier than celestial fairies. I\u2019m afraid that this guy Xiao Jingting really suffered in the past year and in my opinion, when this guy comes backm he will go to a brothel and stay there for 10 days to half a month,\u201d Zheng Kai said.\u201cOld Zheng! Do you want to accompany him?\u201d Zhou Chao said jokingly.Zheng Kai laughed awkwardly and said, \u201cI have a wife. How can I go to this kind of place?\u201dVisit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201cNo way, our Young Master Zheng actually became a hen-pecked husband.\u201d Zhou Mi burst into laughter.Sun Hao looked down. After Xiao Jingting was sent to Mound Village, he once accidentally came to a town near Mound Village. Thinking of the way Xiao Jingting was obsessed with his sister, he found it disgusting and asked local ruffians to bring Xiao Jingting down.Sun Hao had originally forgotten this matter, but when he heard of Xiao Jingting coming back, he suddenly remembered it.Sun Hao stroked his chin and said to himself,\u00a0Xiao Jingting was capable enough to survive in the countryside place until now. Xiao Linfeng and Wang Lu were back, so this guy Xiao Jingting would definitely shake things again.\u2026\u2026Xiao Xiaofan\u2019s eyes shone brightly as he looked through the window at the stalls along the street.\u201cBrother, there are so many people on the street! I didn\u2019t even notice it before.\u201d Xiao Xiaofan.Xiao Xiaodong rolled his eyes and thought in his heart:\u00a0You used to stay at home, how could you notice?Xiao Xiaodong clenched his fists as he thought of the days he used to live in the Xiao family and couldn\u2019t help having some lingering fear.\u201cBrother, look at that puppeteer, it\u2019s so cute.\u201d Xiao Xiaofan was overjoyed.\u201cDon\u2019t get so close to me!\u201d Xiao Xiaodong had a headache.Xiao Xiaofan recently seemed to be obsessed with eating smelly things, but also ate more and more. Even though he ate so much, he was always in front of him.Due to the lack of space on the horse, Xiao Xiaodong was still driven to share a carriage with the stinky Xiao Xiaofan after his complaint was ineffective.\u201cWhen I\u2019m free, I will let daddy take me shopping.\u201d Xiao Xiaofan said to himself.When Xiao Xiaodong heard his words, he was also a little moved. In the past, Xiao Jingting was only busy eating, drinking, whoring and gambling. Xiao Xiaodong and Xiao Xiaofan avoided Xiao Jingting, so they naturally didn\u2019t dare to ask Xiao Jingting to take them to go shopping. But now\u2026 maybe they could look forward to it.Xiao Xiaofan sat back in the carriage and said, \u201cBrother, back in the city, Dad won\u2019t turn into his old self, right?\u201dXiao Xiaodong shook his head and said, \u201cDaddy said no, I also don\u2019t think so.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The most familiar thing for him in the whole town was the various brothels.Xu Muan looked at Xiao Jingting\u2019s face and said, \u201cAre you all right?\u201dXiao Jingting shook his head and said, \u201cIt\u2019s all right, it\u2019s all right.\u201d He was just amazed that the original body owner had been immersed in the brothels all day long since he was young, but was not impotent because of that. He had to say that people from this world have really strong physical quality.\u201cWe are almost there,\u201d Xiao Jingting said.Xu Muan nodded and said, \u201cYes!\u201dAt the gate of Xiao House, Xiao Yuerong yawned lazily.\u201cWhy haven\u2019t they come until now?! How long are we going to wait?!\u201d Xiao Yuerong hugged Zheng Peier\u2019s arm and shook it, acting coquettish.Zheng Pei\u2019er frowned with some embarrassment and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know when they will come, either.\u201dXiao Yuerong said in a distressed way, \u201cRongrong is so tired!\u201dWang Lu looked at Xiao Yuerong, and said with caring eyes, \u201cRongrong, if you\u2019re tired, go and have a rest first.\u201dXiao Yuerong blinked his black bright eyes and said with a good and sensible face, \u201cIt\u2019s hard for second and third uncle to come back. Rong Rong will wait a little longer.\u201dWang Lu looked at Xiao Yuerong\u2019s cute appearance and her eyes flashed with a bit of soft light.Zheng Pei\u2019er secretly glanced at Xiao Yuerong admiringly.Xiao Qingyan frowned and said somewhat unhappily, \u201cSecond brother, third brother are really something. Didn\u2019t they say they would arrive in the morning? It is almost noon now, with such delay, how long do father and mother have to wait?\u201dWang Lu lightly sighed and said, \u201cMaybe there was a delay on the road. With such a long journey, it might take much more time.\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026A horse-drawn carriage was coming from a distance.\u201cThey are coming.\u201d Xiao Linfeng\u2019s voice was calm, but the light tone of his voice still hinted at his good mood.The jiao carriage came from far to near and quickly drove to the front.As soon as the carriage stopped, Xiao Jinfeng jumped down from the carriage. Seeing Xiao Jinfeng, Xiao Linfeng\u2019s pupils constricted and then he uttered a soft sigh.Xiao Jinfeng didn\u2019t use Hidden Qi Technique, so Xiao Linfeng could see through his level at once.Wang Lu looked at Xiao Jinfeng and said, \u201cHow can it be, he is at fifth level?\u201dWhen Xiao Qingyan heard his parents\u2019 question, his face tensed up and his eyes swept over Xiao Jinfeng with eyes full of scrutiny.Feeling Xiao Jinfeng\u2019s aura that was no less than his own, Xiao Qingyan was full of amazement. Xiao Jinfeng also became a fifth level Practitioner, but Xiao Qingyan only felt that he had been heavily punched. Xiao Qingyan always prided himself on being cultivator at fifth level of Qi Practice but as a result, he found that his brother who he disliked also became fifth level Qi Practitioner, which made him have mixed feelings.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.After Xiao Jinfeng got out of the carriage, he turned and held out his hand to the man in the carriage. Mu Shuyu first handed the child to Xiao Jinfeng and then got out of the carriage.Seeing Mu Shuyu, Xiao Linfeng was lightly amazed again.Hearing his father\u2019s amazement, Xiao Qingyan looked at Mu Shuyu who he had seen in the past. At that time, he even sarcastically mocked Mu Shuyu, so now Xiao Qingyan was surprised to find that Mu Shuyu actually also became a fifth level Cultivator.Seeing the strength of Xiao Jinfeng and Mu Shuyu, the people who came out to watch the bustle of the third and fourth house had a complicated look on their faces.Holding the child in his arms, Xiao Jinfeng walked up to Xiao Linfeng and Wang Lu and said faintly, \u201cFather, mother, I am back. This is my wife Mu Shuyu.\u201dMu Shuyu was pulled by Xiao Jinfeng, nervously saluted to Xiao Linfeng and said, \u201cGreetings, father, greetings, mother.\u201dXiao Linfeng looked at Mu Shuyu and laughed, looked at Xiao Jinfeng admiringly, saying, \u201cYou have good eyes.\u201dXiao Jinfeng nodded and said, \u201cShuyu is very good.\u201dXiao Hefeng looked at the baby in Xiao Jinfeng\u2019s hand and said, \u201cJinfeng! Is this your son?\u201dXiao Jinfeng nodded and said, \u201cYes, he\u2019s mine and Shuyu\u2019s son.\u201d\u201cJinfeng, you are really fast! You already have a child and he looks about two month old,\u201d Xiao Hefeng said.Xiao Jinfeng looked at the baby in swaddling clothes and said, \u201cYes!\u201dXiao Jinfeng knew clearly that Xiao Hefeng was trying to say that he had already had a child with Mu Shuyu before he broke off his engagement to Sun Miaoyin. Xiao Jinfeng didn\u2019t want to explain that it was an accident. Anyway, his reputation was already rotten, so if it rotted even more, Xiao Jinfeng didn\u2019t care.Sun Miaoyin was already married, so what was the point of talking about it now?Seeing that everyone\u2019s eyes were on Xiao Jinfeng and were filled with wonder and appreciation, Zheng Pei\u2019er heart couldn\u2019t help but feel a bit being threatened.\u201cWhy hasn\u2019t the third brother come out yet!?

Xiao Linfeng\u2019s appearance was quite normal, but his heart had already been turned upside down.Wang Lu was full of astonishment as she stared at them with big eyes, looking both unbelievable and ecstatic.Liu Xian hid behind people and looked at Xiao Jingting in disbelief. Although Xiao Jinfeng advanced to the fifth level of Qi Practice, Liu Xian felt surprised but she still thought it was okay. After all, although Xiao Jinfeng\u2019s attributes were not very good, his cultivation talent was good and he was very progressive. But Xiao Jingting was different, all his cultivation was promoted by medicine, and his foundation was very poor. Such a good-for-nothing actually practiced to fifth level and even Xu Muan practiced to fifth level as well!Liu Xian tugged at the handkerchief in her hand and felt that her heart was squeezed by a hand.Xiao Jinfeng and Xiao Jingting were both fifth-level Qi Practitioners, and no one had told her about such a big thing before.Liu Xian secretly scolded herself for being too negligent and only thought that driving Xiao Jingting out of the house would solve all the problems. She didn\u2019t expect these two people to live outside like usual.Liu Xian looked in the direction of Xiao Qingyan and seeing that his expression was not very good, she immediately felt much better.Liu Xian thought:\u00a0It\u2019s good to have more talents in the second house. It will become livelier.Xiao Hefeng looked at Xiao Jingting and said, \u201cJingting, you also become fifth level Qi Practitioner!\u201dXiao Jingting nodded and said, \u201cYes!\u201d\u201cHow could you cultivate so fast?!\u201d Xiao Hefeng was surprised.\u201cAfter this nephew left home, he learned from his bitter experience and felt that his previous days had been too decadent. So he cultivated night and day to get to where he is today.\u201dAfter Xiao Hefeng snorted at Xiao Jingting\u2019s words. He still smiled, saying, \u201cNephew, you are really diligent.\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026Xiao Yuerong looked at Xiao Xiaofan, with puzzlement flashing in his eyes.In Xiao Yuerong\u2019s impression, Xiao Xiaofan was thin and shriveled. But looking at the little person behind Xiao Xiaodong who was dressed in flashy gorgeous clothes, he was round and pearly white. Xiao Yuerong was doubtful that this person was really Xiao Xiaofan.Xiao Xiaofan bared his teeth towards Xiao Yuerong, and Xiao Yuerong recognized him at once.Xiao Linfeng looked at Xiao Xiaodong somewhat surprised before saying, \u201cJingting, Xiaodong is a second level Qi Practicioner.\u201dXiao Jingting nodded and said, \u201cYes! Xiaodong, Xiaofan, come over and meet Grandpa and Grandma.\u201dStanding behind Zheng Pei\u2019er, Xiao Yuefeng couldn\u2019t help twist his face when he heard Xiao Linfeng\u2019s words.Zheng Pei\u2019er looked at Xiao Jinfeng, Xiao Jingting and others with a heavy heart. Originally when Xiao Linfeng wanted to take Xiao Jingting and Xiao Jinfeng back, Zheng Pei\u2019er didn\u2019t take it seriously, only felt that Xiao family had a few more mouths to feed. But this time, looking at Xiao Jinfeng, Xiao Jingting and others who had all advanced to the fifth level of Qi practice, Zheng Pei\u2019er couldn\u2019t help but feel a little uneasy.The reason why Xiao Qingyan was able to advance to the fifth level of Qi Practice so quickly had a lot to do with the fact that Xiao Linfeng and Wang Lu had poured most of their resources into him. Xiao Jinfeng and Xiao Jingting were now so successful. Xiao Linfeng and Wang Lu will not change their key training target, right?Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201cMother,\u201d Xiao Yuerong tugged Zheng Peier\u2019s sleeve and called back Zheng Pei\u2019er back consciousness.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Zheng Peier asked.\u201cMother, Xiao Xiaofan is baring his teeth at me, he\u2019s provoking me.\u201d Xiao Yuerong was very unhappy.Zheng Peier comforted Xiao Yuerong and said, \u201cAlright, don\u2019t argue, keep it down.\u201dAlthough Zheng Peier didn\u2019t know what happened to Xiao Jingting, just by looking at Xu Muan\u2019s strength and the fact that Xiao Xiaodong and Xiao Xiaofan were no longer cowering in fear, she knew that she could not treat these two boys with the same attitude as before.The crowd chatted with each other at the door for a while and then entered the room.\u2026\u2026After dispatching the crowd that had come to find out the news, Xiao Linfeng eagerly pulled Xiao Jingting and Xiao Jinfeng to speak privately.\u201cYou said that you were able to advance so quickly because you ate a pure white lotus flower?\u201dXiao Jingting nodded and said, \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Xiao Jingting did not want to expose the Spiritual wine so he and Xiao Jinfeng agreed in advance to use the same explanation when asked by others. Saying that their progress was due to eating heavenly treasures.Xiao Jinfeng knew that Xiao Jingting had kept a secret from him but he was still happy to help him conceal.Xiao Qingyan sourly said, \u201cYou two are so lucky! It\u2019s such a good thing but you didn\u2019t think about your brother, only wanting to benefit outsiders.\u201dXiao Qingyan secretly thought:\u00a0This heavenly treasure advanced Xiao Jingting to the fifth level of Qi Practice. If he had eaten it, he would be able to enter sixth level of Qi Practice and compete with Zhou Kanghe, the genius of the Zhou family.\u201cI can\u2019t afford brothers who are eager to draw the line as soon as something happens.\u201d Xiao Jinfeng coolly said. They never had these heavenly treasures, but even if they did, he wouldn\u2019t give it to someone like Xiao Qingyan.\u201cSecond brother, what do you mean?\u201d Xiao Qingyan asked.\u201cWhat do I mean? I don\u2019t mean anything. Big brother, what did you say to me in the inn? You asked me not to call you elder brother and you said you didn\u2019t have such a shameless brother as me,\u201d Xiao Jinfeng coldly said.Xiao Qingyan\u2019s face became sulky and then turned pale.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, Xiao Qingyan didn\u2019t expect that Xiao Jinfeng would directly expose this matter directly in front of their parents. Xiao Qingyan who had been humiliated, simply spoke bluntly at once.Xiao Jinfeng snorted and said nothing.Xiao Jingting rubbed his nose. When Xiao Jinfeng got along with him, he was always very generous. Xiao Jingting did not expect that Xiao Jinfeng would be so sharp. Whatever grievances he had, he said it on the spot, not even bothering to do superficial work.Xiao Linfeng\u2019s face darkened as he said\uff0c\u00a0\u201cEnough, you are brothers. How can brothers have overnight feud? Jinfeng, your elder brother was just joking, why are you so upset about it?\u201dXiao Jinfeng kept a straight face and didn\u2019t say anything. His parents still chose to side with Xiao Qingyan, even though he expected it, Xiao Jinfeng was still a little disappointed.Wang Lu looked at Xiao Jingting and said earnestly, \u201cJingting! This was such a good thing, you should have kept a copy for your elder brother. If your elder brother lives a better life, it will also be good for you.\u201d\u201cThe stuff was found by Xu Muan, so I was just sharing Xu Muan\u2019s good fortune,\u201d Xiao Jingting said.Wang Lu disapproved \u201cXu Muan is just your concubine, your words can decide if he will be beaten or sold. All of his things are naturally yours.\u201dXiao Jingting laughed as he said, \u201cMisery shows the truth.\u00a0(TN: Miserable situations reveal the true face of people. Or when you are down, only then you know who\u2019s true to you.) This time when I was driven to Mound Village, only Muan accompanied me. All of my former confidantes hid far away, so I think I need to treat Muan better.\u201dWang Lu looked at Xiao Jingting in surprise. She froze for a moment, then nodded and said, \u201cYou are right to think so.\u201d\u201cAlthough heavenly treasures are good, they always have their limitations. Your strength was not enough to take heavenly treasures so early. I am afraid it will develop resistance in your bodies, affecting your future advancement,\u201d Xiao Linfeng said.Xiao Jinfeng didn\u2019t care, \u201cI was poisoned before. My meridians were already damaged. I thought that for my whole life, I would be stuck at level four of Qi Practice. After taking the heavenly treasure, at least I entered the fifth level, so it was definitely a blessing for me. With my cultivation of fifth level of Qi practice, at least I should be able to rest assured.\u201dXiao Jinfeng didn\u2019t tell the truth. His meridians had already recovered under the effect of the spiritual wine. Thinking that his parents had always wanted him to help Xiao Qingyan in the future, Xiao Jinfeng simply discredited himself.Xiao Linfeng sighed and said, \u201cI\u2019ve wronged you.\u201d Although Xiao Linfeng was biased towards his eldest son, Xiao Jinfeng was also Xiao Linfeng\u2019s son after all. Xiao Linfeng was still heartbroken when something happened to him.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Coming out of Xiao Linfeng\u2019s place, Xiao Jingting and Xiao Jinfeng left together.Xiao Qingyan\u2019s eyes were filled with malicious intentions as he looked at the backs of Xiao Jingting and Xiao Jinfeng.\u201cQingyan! Your two brothers left together.\u201d Zheng Pei\u2019er walked up to Xiao Qingyan.Xiao Qingyan nodded and said, \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThose two brothers of yours became really close now.\u201d Zheng Pei\u2019er frowned.Xiao Qingyan snorted coldly and said, \u201cThe two of them are now united to deal with me.\u201d\u201cQingyan, how did your two younger brothers improve so fast, as well as their two wives and those two little brats?\u201d Xiao Yuefeng\u2019s advancement to the second level of Qi Practice was something that Zheng Pei\u2019er had always been proud of. But she didn\u2019t expect that one of Xiao Jingting\u2019s two brats would also be at second level of Qi Practice.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201cThey said, they ate a heavenly treasure and all of sudden, their cultivation advanced.\u201d Xiao Qingyan said sourly.Zheng Pei\u2019er eyes became red with envy, \u201cHeavenly treasure, is there any left?\u201dXiao Qingyan shook his head and said, \u201cI heard it\u2019s gone.\u201d Xiao Qingyan didn\u2019t believe it was gone. It was just that his two younger brothers had a prejudice against him and didn\u2019t want to share it.\u201cYour brothers are so lucky!\u201d Zheng Pei\u2019er gritted her teeth. She was only at the fourth level of Qi Practice. As a result, both Xiao Jinfeng and Xiao Jingting\u2019s wives were at fifth level of Qi Practice, but they were just unpresentable Gers! Why were they worthy of taking heavenly materials!?\u201cThat child of your second brother is not a small kid anymore. It looks like your brother had already hooked up with that Ger before Sun Miaoyin broke off the engagement with him.\u201d Zheng Pei\u2019er secretly thought: It was said before that Xiao Jinfeng was chivalrous and righteous, but turns out it was all nonsense. Xiao Jinfeng was probably not a decent good man.Xiao Qingyan had just been embarrassed in front of his parents and was full of anger at the mention of Xiao Jinfeng. \u201cFather said that taking heavenly materials has both advantages and disadvantages. I\u2019m afraid that my brother has developed resistance. In the future, it will be difficult for him to advance to the sixth level of Qi Practice.\u201dHearing it, Zheng Pei\u2019er said, \u201cWell! What a shame!\u201d Her face might have looked sad but she was gloating a little in her heart.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026The news that Xiao Jingting and the other three were all level five Qi practitioners spread throughout the Xiao Family like wildfire. That night, countless people in the Xiao family had difficulty sleeping.\u201cXiao Jingting has actually advanced to the fifth level of Qi Practice.\u201d Sun Miaomiao squinted her eyes. She didn\u2019t go to meet Xiao Jingting and Xiao Jinfeng today and all the news was what she heard from others.\u201cYou must be mistaken!\u201d Sun Miaomiao looked at Xiao Muhong.Xiao Muhong shook his head and said, \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201dSun Miaomiao said in a puzzled manner, \u201cHow could this prodigal son advance to the fifth level? It doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d\u201cI heard that they ate a heavenly treasure, so that\u2019s why they advanced,\u201d Xiao Muhong said.Zheng Pei\u2019er couldn\u2019t keep her mouth shut. Knowing about the matter of the Heavenly treasure, she immediately publicized it to the whole family. When Liu Xian heard that a Heavenly treasure was found in the mountain forest near Mound Village, her heart was remorseful and her liver ached. She regretted why she didn\u2019t send Xiao Jingting to a different place initially.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

These guards bowed in greeting when they met Xiao Jingting and Xiao Jinfeng.Xiao Jingting and Xiao Jinfeng were now extremely famous, and this group of guards respected both of them very much.What Xiao Jingting saw in the Xiao family was a completely different scene than in the village, hundreds of spiritual planters were busy in the fields. The golden soil infiltrating earthworms were drilling in and out of the fields.There were several mus of first-class fields, which were connected to a whole land, and each field had only a few sparse spiritual plants planted.\u201cSpiritual plants above level five can only be planted in the first-class fields. These spiritual plants need a high spiritual aura, and have a strong sense of territory. They cannot be planted too close to each other,\u201d Xiao Jinfeng said.Xiao Jingting nodded his head in understanding. Spiritual plants above the fifth level were expensive because they were extremely difficult to grow. They would wither and die if one was not careful enough, and if there was even a slight problem with the weather, the spiritual plants could also have problems.\u201cThere are very few high-level spiritual plants that can be planted, most of the high level spiritual plants have special requirements for growing and will wither when planted in the fields,\u201d Xiao Jinfeng said.Xiao Jingting sighed, \u201cThe Xiao family has so many fields!\u201dXiao Jinfeng smiled and said, \u201cAfter all, the Xiao family is one of the four major families in Desert City.\u201dXiao Muhong came over with Sun Miaomiao, \u201d Cousins, you have come to inspect the fields!\u201d\u201cJust for a casual look.\u201d Xiao Jingting faintly swept a glance at Sun Miaomiao, not hiding the disgust in his eyes.Sun Miaomiao\u2019s heart sank as she faced Xiao Jingting\u2019s gaze.Xiao Jingting and Xiao Muhong exchanged a few words and then they left.Xiao Muhong was filled with surprise as he looked at Xiao Jingting\u2019s back. He had thought that Xiao Jingting would run to the brothel after his return, but as soon as he returned, he actually inspected the family land together with Xiao Jinfeng, which was really strange.\u201cMiaomiao, are you okay?!\u201d Xiao Muhong asked.Sun Miaomiao shook her head and said, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201dIn the past, when Xiao Jingting met her, he acted like a salivating pervert. But just now, when Xiao Jingting saw her, it was as if he had seen something dirty.Sun Miaomiao was originally a little worried that when Xiao Jingting came back, she would be entangled with him regardless of her situation. But she did not expect that after Xiao Jingting came back, he would avoid her like a cockroach.After getting rid of Xiao Muhong and Sun Miaomiao, Xiao Jinfeng looked at Xiao Jingting strangely. Finally, Xiao Jingting looked at Xiao Jinfeng and said, \u201cSecond brother, why are you looking at me like this?\u201d\u201cI was just a little surprised. You saw Sun Miaomiao and you really didn\u2019t really care,\u201d Xiao Jinfeng said.\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful woman, but it\u2019s my sister-in-law. I naturally want to draw a line with her,\u201d Xiao Jingting said.Xiao Jinfeng smiled and said, \u201cYou\u2019re right if you think so.\u201dAs Xiao Jinfeng and Xiao Jingting were laughing and walking in the field, a guard rushed over to Xiao Jingting and said, \u201cYoung Master Jingting! Bad news! Something has happened at home!\u201d\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Xiao Jingting asked.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201cLittle master Xiaofan and Young Master Yuerong got into a fight. Xu Muan asked me to inform you of it.\u201d The guard said.\u201cWho won?!\u201d As soon as Xiao Jingting spoke, he immediately realized that it didn\u2019t seem quite right, \u201cIs anyone hurt?\u201d\u201cYoung master Xiaofan used a brick to break open the head of young master Yuerong.\u201dXiao Jingting calmed down a bit and thought:\u00a0It\u2019s good that his son didn\u2019t suffer. Xiao Yuerong was so fat and looked like he had thick skin, so Xiao Jingting estimated that the injury shouldn\u2019t be serious.Xiao Jinfeng frowned and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go back quickly. Father and mother love their grandson Xiao Yuerong the most. If Xiao Xiaofan injured him, we\u2019ll be in trouble.\u201dXiao Jingting felt it deeply reasonable. His parents did not value Xiaofan but Xiao Yuerong was a precious baby. If this matter caused trouble in front of his parents, Xiaofan was bound to suffer.Xiao Jingting released the fire cloud bird from the beast rune and sat on the fire cloud bird together with Xiao Jinfeng and rushed to the Xiao family.\u2026.Xiao Xiaofan knelt on the ground with a straight face in the hall of the Xiao family.Xu Muan frowned as he looked at Xiao Xiaofan with a worried face.Zheng Pei\u2019er twisted her handkerchief, sobbing as she looked at Xiao Xiaofan with resentment.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?!\u201d Xiao Linfeng asked.\u201cXiaofan smashed Rongrong with a brick! Rongrong is so small and his head\u00a0is covered with blood.\u201d Zheng Pei\u2019er said with a face full of guilt.\u201cHe deserved it. I told him I didn\u2019t want to play with him. He had asked me to be a horse for him to ride. I don\u2019t want to be a horse for him,\u201d Xiao Xiaofan said angrily.Zheng Pei\u2019er looked at Xu Muan with hatred, and said, \u201cXu Muan, how did you educate your children? You taught him to be so rude, he is so young but is already so good at bullying.\u201d\u201cSister-in-law, you can\u2019t say that. Xiaofan is only four years old. Yuerong is more than five years old. If the two of them fought, it would be Yuerong who has the advantage,\u201d Mu Shuyu said.\u201cWho do you think you are? You just hooked up with Xiao Jinfeng in an indiscriminate manner, and now you think you will have a stable position when you give birth to Xiao Jinfeng\u2019s son? In your dream.\u201d Zheng Pei\u2019er was born in the Zheng family, one of four major families of Desert city. She had never taken the low-born family members into consideration. Mu Shuyu had come from a humble family, but he had advanced to the fifth level of Qi Practice by chance, making Zheng Pei\u2019er very uncomfortable.\u201cZheng Pei\u2019er, watch your language,\u201d Xiao Linfeng said.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The Sun family withdrew from marriage and made the Xiao family lose face. Xiao Jinfeng having a child and bringing back a wife, although it provoked criticism, Xiao Linfeng always felt that it recovered his face. Mu Shuyu\u2019s attributes and strengths were good, so Xiao Linfeng was very satisfied.\u201cFather, Yuerong is hurt. I am distressed!\u201d Zheng Pei\u2019er sobbed.\u201cMy younger brother was defending himself. It was Xiao Yuerong who first pulled my younger brother\u2019s hair and insisted that he be a horse. He is so fat, but my younger brother is so thin, he would be squashed if he played horse for him,\u201d Xiao Xiaodong said.Xiao Xiaofan and Xiao Yuerong fought. Xiao Xiaodong and Xiao Yuefeng also fought but were discovered early and pulled apart.\u201cWhen adults talk, little children shouldn\u2019t interrupt,\u201d Xiao Qingyan said angrily. In Xiao Qingyan\u2019s impression, Xiao Xiaofan and Xiao Xiaodong were both silent and submissive. As a result, when they came back this time, these two stinky brats dared to fight with his own son.\u201cYou adults are bullying the child, so I just interrupted,\u201d Xiao Xiaodong said, not willing to show any weakness.In the hall, people were at each other\u2019s throats when Xiao Jingting and Xiao Jinfeng came in. Xiao Xiaofan seeing Xiao Jingting come in, looked like he had found a backer. He got up from the ground and jumped into Xiao Jingting\u2019s arms, shouting, \u201cDaddy!\u201dSeeing that Xiao Xiaofan had made such a big mistake and didn\u2019t kneel properly, her face became even worse.\u201cThe third brother is back!\u201d Zheng Pei\u2019er was indifferent.Xiao Jingting nodded and said, \u201cI\u2019m back.\u201d\u201cThe bastard you raised beat his cousin like this, he is going to be a murderer!\u201d Zheng Pei\u2019er said.Xiao Jingting said with a smile, \u201cSister-in-law, what nonsense are you talking about? It\u2019s common for children to fight each other, they won\u2019t die. Xiaofan\u2019s enlightenment was late and his cultivation base is low. In addition, his body has been so thin before, so his strength is very small. Even if he smashed Yuerong, how much can he really hurt him? Sister-in-law, you wrapped bandages so thickly for Yuerong, be careful not to cover him up!\u201dZheng Pei\u2019er face twisted, \u201cThird brother, what do you mean? Are you trying to say I am making a fuss?\u201dXiao Jingting smiled but didn\u2019t reply to Zheng Peter\u2019s words, asking Xiao Xiaofan, \u201cSon, what\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cBig Fatty wanted me to be a horse for him to ride. I didn\u2019t want to be a horse for him so he pulled my hair and kicked me, so I picked up a brick and threw it at him. I accidentally hurt him, and Big Fatty made a lot of noise and cried and howled\u2026\u201d Xiao Xiaofan said while exaggerating his imitation of Xiao Yuerong crying and howling.Xiao Jingting felt it was funny in his heart but forced himself to endure it. Xiao Jingting glared at Xiao Xiaofan and said, \u201cWhat big fatty?! He is your cousin.\u201dXiao Jingting looked toward Zheng Pei\u2019er and said, \u201cSister-in-law! How did you raise your son so fat? He is so fat but he is still asking my skinny son to be a horse for him to ride.\u201dZheng Peier\u2019s face darkened. Xiao Yuerong was spoiled and pampered since childhood. He was a little fat, but not so fat. Xiao Xiaofan used to be thin, but now he was plump, he couldn\u2019t be seen as thin anymore.\u201cThird brother, what do you mean? Do you want to shirk responsibility?\u201d Xiao Qingyan said.\u201cBut it\u2019s just a fight between children. Big brother, why are you making a big fuss about this trivial matter? People will laugh at us.\u201d Xiao Jingting was not willing to show any weakness.\u201cMy son almost got killed by your son,\u201d Xiao Qingyan said.\u201cBig brother, Xiaofan is one year younger than your son, yet he still can\u2019t beat Xiaofan. And he wants you to fight for him\u2026\u201d Xiao Jingting said sarcastically.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Wang Lu sighed lightly and said, \u201cJingting, your son is too ruthless, even to his cousins he is cruel. It will not be easy to discipline him when he grows up.\u201d\u201cMother, you can\u2019t say that! My son is a very good boy. Back in the Mound Village, when I was busy, the two of them made fire to cook and delivered food. They also got along well with the village children, they never fought and caused trouble,\u201d Xiao Jingting said.Hearing Xiao Jingting mention Mound Village, Wang Lu suddenly looked a bit guilty.Zheng Pei\u2019er said calmly, \u201cThird Brother\u2019s meaning is that the problem is with my son.\u201dXiao Jingting shrugged his shoulders and said, \u201cSister-in-law,\u00a0nothing forcibly done is going to be agreeable. My son has said that he wouldn\u2019t play with your son. Yet your son still insisted on pulling my son to play with him. Now that they had a fight, you blame no one but my son. That\u2019s not reasonable, right?\u201dXiao Jinfeng stood to the side and said \u201cSister-in-law, where did your son get the bad habit of having other people play horse for him? There are plenty of horses in the family. Why was he looking for his cousin?\u201dSeeing that Xiao Jinfeng took side with Xiao Jingting, Xiao Qingyan gritted his teeth, \u201cSecond Brother, are you now joining forces with Third Brother to target me?\u201dXiao Jinfeng glanced at Xiao Qingyan and said, \u201cBig brother, that\u2019s not what I mean. I\u2019m just discussing the matter on its own merits.\u201dZheng Pei\u2019er looked at Wang Lu and said, \u201cMother, Yuerong is your grandson. How can you let someone beat him up like this?\u201dXiao Jingting sneered and said, \u201cSister-in-law, you sounded as if my son is not mother\u2019s real grandson.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you always say that this son of yours was born from Xu Muan and other\u2019s adultery?\u201d Zheng Pei\u2019er sneered.Xiao Jingting smiled and said, \u201cWhatever I say casually, my sister-in-law shouldn\u2019t take it seriously. Xiaofan looks just like me, how can he not be my son?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s enough! All of you shut up! You\u2019ve only been back for a day and you\u2019re already fighting. Go back and reflect on your mistakes,\u201d Xiao Linfeng said angrily.Xiao Jingting hugged Xiao Xiaofan and said, \u201cSince it is like this, Father, Mother, I will take these two brats back to reflect about their mistakes.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

And the third uncle was like having turned into a different person, who no longer kept silent when seeing the little fool was bullied by Xiao Yuerong.Zheng Pei\u2019er thought with her head down: \u2018Not only Xiao Xiaofan becomes that rampant, so is Xiao Jingting. Xiao Jingting has always been jealous of Xiao Qingyan\u2019s getting better treatment than him, now that he becomes more powerful, he must want to strive for a superior position.\u2019Xiao Jinfeng had always been earning his living with the mercenary team, but now he was standing with and defending Xiao Jingting all the time. Though Xiao Jinfeng was not considered important, he could bring trouble by colluding with Xiao Jingting.After getting Xiao Yuerong and Xiao Yuefeng settled, Zheng Pei\u2019er walked out of the room.\u201cHas our son fallen asleep? \u201dXiao Qingyan asked with an unhappy look.Zheng Pei\u2019er nodded, \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cIs Yuerong OK?\u201d asked Xiao Qingyan.\u201cHe\u2019s been holding his head and crying out of pain.\u201d Zheng Pei\u2019er replied sadly.\u201cThe third brother has never taken that little fool seriously before, but this time he should defend him like that!\u201d Xiao Qingyan said bitterly.\u201cIn my opinion, Xiao Jingting was not truly helping that little fool, but by this excuse he wanted to give you a hard time.\u201d Zheng Pei\u2019er analyzed.Xiao Qingyan nodded, \u201cYou\u2019re right. Now third brother is more powerful, he can become more ambitious as well. But I hate Xiao Jinfeng mostly, he just helps Xiao Jingting against me all around.\u201dXiao Qingyan clenched his fist and thought, although their parents were still partial to him, since Xiao Jingting and Xiao Jinfeng made progress in their cultivation, their parents had also been impressed by the two and quite slighted him. But fortunately, both two guys had taken the miraculous medicine that led to the resistance to more drugs, and it could be hard for them to make further progress.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026In Xiao Chengfeng\u2019s secondary house.\u201cMom, what makes you so happy?\u201d Xiao Muhong looked at Liu Xian and asked.Liu Xian smiled and replied, \u201cIt\u2019s merely two days after Xiao Jingting\u2019s coming back that his son has fought with Xiao Qingyan\u2019s son. And it\u2019s said that Xiao Yuerong was heavily injured by that little fool. Xiao Jingting had never taken that little fool seriously before, but this time he just defended him so much. It seemed Xiao Jingting and Xiao Qingyan had been acting against one another.\u201dXiao Muhong sneered and thought: \u2018It\u2019s nice for those two brothers fighting against each other, otherwise, it\u2019s the truly worrying situation to him.\u2019\u201cZheng Pei\u2019er is not that tolerant. Since her son was bullied, she must has born grudges against Xiao Jingting.\u201dLiu Xian nodded, \u201cThat\u2019s true. She is quite brute, and Xiao Yuerong just follows her mother and is a guy who never bears losing out.\u201dVisit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Xiao Yuerong was a bully-boy in the Xiao family, and usually just made people around serve him at his will, and his servants just respected him as a young master and were pushed around by him.Xiao Yuerong also liked to bully his peers, especially those who were not favored, and thus had made a lot trouble. Though he was a child, he knew how to pick the weak guys who had no powerful background and could be easily handled by his mom, Zheng Pei\u2019er, to bully. Hence, Xiao Xiaofan had always been bullied by him\u2026 But this time, Xiao Yuerong couldn\u2019t have expected his failure. He was heavily injured on the head by Xiao Xiaofan, but Xiao Xiaofan was just okay, having nothing happened to him.\u201cI heard that Xiao Jingting treats your wife with indifference since his coming back this time, is that true?\u201d asked Liu Xian.Xiao Muhong nodded, \u201cYes. It seems Xiao Jingting has turned into a different man.\u201d But it seemed that since Xiao Jingting came back, he got on better with Xu Muan.Liu Xian said gravely, \u201cI can\u2019t understand how that guy was so lucky and should has advanced by 5 levels. When Xiao Jingting just arrived at the Mound Village, I had sent someone to inquire about him. My man returned and reported that he just wallowed in self-pity there, spending his money recklessly in gambling and getting into the Happy Powder.\u201d\u201cMom, who has been sent by you? Could he report you the fake message?\u201d asked Xiao Muhong.Liu Xian shook her head and said, \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be that case. It\u2019s a loyalist having served me for years. I don\u2019t think he would give me the fake message.\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Walking through the long corridor, Xiao Jingting met Sun Miaomiao by accident. \u201cCousin-in-law.\u201d Xiao Jingting greeted dispassionately and turned to leave.\u201cJingting.\u201d Sun Miaomiao called Xiao Jingting.Sun Miaomiao\u2019s ruefully calling just evoked a brain-bristled feeling to Xiao Jingting. Taking a look at Sun Miaomiao, he asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d\u201cAre you still hating me, Jingting?\u201d Sun Miaomiao asked with an upset face.Xiao Jingting nodded, \u201cYes.\u201dSun Miaomiao was shocked, since she couldn\u2019t expect that he would admit it so flatly, \u201cJust because of my marrying to your cousin?\u201d\u201cNo matter whom you marry to, it\u2019s none of my business. But I am just astounded, is my pursuit of you make you so sick that your family just want me go astray and want my family torn apart?\u201d Xiao Jingting said coldly.\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Sun Miaomiao said.Xiao Jingting sneered, \u201cGo back to ask your brother.

In fact, our love has never been started yet.\u201d Xiao Jingting replied indifferently.Looking at Xiao Jingting\u2019s leaving back, Sun Miaomiao felt her heart filled with an unspeakable sense of emptiness.\u2026\u2026In Xiao Jingting\u2019s secondary house.Xiao Xiaofan held his feet and rolled about in the bed.\u201cI hit him with a brick and made him cry like a baby, ha ha\u2026\u201d Xiao Xiaofan said happily.Looking at Xiao Xiaofan, Xu Muan happy as well, but had a sense of worry at the same time. \u201cAlright, stop laughing. Thanks to your father\u2019s showing up in time, you wouldn\u2019t be prisoned into the ancestral hall by your grandparents.\u201dZheng Pei\u2019er had suggested prisoning him into the ancestral hall for several days to reflect on what he has done, till Xiao Jingting came.The ancestral hall was a cold and humid place, and giving Xiao Xiaofan was still so young, how could he bear to stay there for days! However, the issue was, if it were not for Mu Shuyu who helped to reason with them, Wang Lu might have agreed with the punishment at that time.\u201cMy father becomes so nice now.\u201d Xiao Xiaofan said happily, rubbing against the quilt in his arms. Father has never so cared about me before, even when I was pushed into the river by that bad fatso.\u201dXu Muan lowered his head and was glad in mind. \u2018It\u2019s nice. Fortunately, Xiao Jingting is not the one before.\u2019\u201cIs Xiaofan falling asleep?\u201d Xiao Jingting asked.Xu Muan nodded, \u201cHe is in the bed, but he may be awake and excited now.\u201d\u201cHe should be excited. He wants this revenge for long.\u201d In impression, it seemed that Xiao Xiaofan was always being bullied by Xiao Yuerong and his brother. Since he beat Xiao Yuerong this time, he certainly was excited.\u201cWhat are you talking?\u201d Xu Muan looked around. Walls have ears! Xiao Jingting was just talking nonsense.\u201cParents are still partial to the big brother!\u201d Xiao Jingting said.Xu Muan nodded, \u201cYeah!\u201d Although the parents hadn\u2019t pursued the issue much this time, Xu Muan saw that Wang Lu was dissatisfied with Xiao Xiaofan\u2019s beating Xiao Yuerong.Xiao Qingyan had been always favored by Xiao Linfeng and Wang Lu, that couldn\u2019t be changed so easily.\u201cLet\u2019s hang out with our son in the fair tomorrow,\u201d said Xiao Jingting.Xu Muan hesitated, \u201cTomorrow? Is that OK? Xiaofan has just made such a trouble, should we bring him to hang around?\u201d\u201cWhat are you afraid of? I used to be that unruly anyway, never like Xiao Qingyan,\u201d said Xiao Jingting.Xiao Qingyan looked down upon Xiao Jingting before, and Xiao Jingting felt that Xiao Qingyan had robbed of his resources, so these two brothers had always been in a bad relationship.\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d Xu Muan said.\u201cWe can ask second brother for company,\u201d Xiao Jingting said.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Xu Muan noded, \u201cOK.\u201d It was due to Xiao Jinfeng and Mu Shuyu\u2019s help that Xiao Xiaofan could be okay this time.\u201cDid you meet Sun Miaomiao when you made inspection of the fields today?\u201d asked Xu Muan.Xiao Jingting nodded, \u201cYes. And I met her just now.\u201dXu Muan surprised, \u201cJust now?\u201d\u201cSeems to be a coincidence, but I think she had waited for me there on purpose,\u201d Xiao Jingting said.Xu Muan laughed. If it weren\u2019t for the fact that Xiao Jingting was not the one before, he could have given her a hug when encountering Sun Miaomiao. However, since Xiao Jingting had changed to be a different one, Sun Miaomiao would surely be very disappointed. The Xiao Jingting right now loved men.\u201cSun Miaomiao is a proud one. She must have married to Xiao Muhong by believing that she would handle the power as the main wife,\u201d said Xu Muan.Xiao Jingting said with his arms crossed, \u201cWho cares! After a while, I will request the father to move out.\u201dXu Muan nodded, \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d Xiao Jingting\u2019s jade space couldn\u2019t be exposed under the light. But there are so many ears and eyes in Xiao\u2019s family, it\u2019s hard to hide the secret in front of those sharp-sighted old guys.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d Looking at Xiao Jinfeng, Mu Shuyu asked.Xiao Jinfeng shook his head, \u201cNothing. Only feeling that our parents are too partial.\u201d Without third brother\u2019s arguing, Xiaofan could have been confined into the ancestral hall. Xiao Jinfeng had got along with Xiao Xiaofan for some time before, and thought that although that boy was not that smart, he was a reasonable and obedient.Mu Shuyu nodded, \u201cI think so. It\u2019s Xiaofan\u2019s fault to hit Xiao Yuerong with the brick, but how could Xiao Yuerong demand to ride Xiaofan on his head and treat him like a horse? So disrespectful Xiao Yuerong was. Since Xiaofan\u2019s still so young, he could get hurt by Xiao Yuerong\u2019s bullying. But your big brother just let it go.\u201dXiao Jinfeng shook his head and said, \u201cThey don\u2019t care. In fact, big brother\u2019s two kids used to bully Xu Muan\u2019s two kids, so Xu Muan must have born them much grudge.\u201d Before, he was usually not at home and didn\u2019t have a strong relationship with Xu Muan, so he couldn\u2019t do much for them.Mu Shuyu took a breath and said, \u201cI\u2019ve heard your third brother\u2019s old story, too.

I didn\u2019t see that this third Childe Xiao was such an excellent person; I can\u2019t look down upon him anymore. Since Xiao Jingting has helped Xiao Jinfeng in his distress, and given that Xiao Jinfeng is such a blunt one, they can become very close.\u201dSun Miaoyin had a delicate feeling when she heard Zhou Kanghe mentioning Xiao Jinfeng. She had had an engagement with Xiao Jinfeng since childhood, but when she grew up, she was quite dissatisfied with the engagement due to her talent in cultivation, so did the Sun family, they regret for settling the engagement too hastily in the beginning.When Xiao Jinfeng\u2019s parents were \u201cgone\u201d, Sun family took the opportunity to break off the engagement.After that, Sun Miaoyin felt relieved. And she had thought that Xiao Jinfeng would be upset by this for some time, but she heard that Xiao Jinfeng had fallen in love with a Ger called Mu Shuyu even when the engagement with Sun Miaoyin was still there, and Mu Shuyu even had conceived Xiao Jinfeng\u2019s baby at that time.Sun Miaoyin just felt quite uncomfortable by knowing that.And it\u2019s said that Mu Shuyu also had a talent in cultivation and had advanced to level five of Qi Practice as Sun Miaoyin did, which made her even more uncomfortable.\u2026\u2026The next day, Xiao Jingting hung out with his family early in the morning.Xiao Jingting had also invited Xiao Jinfeng and Mu Shuyu for company. Though Xiao Jinfeng didn\u2019t feel it appropriate to hang around like this since Xiao Xiaofan had just injured Xiao Yuerong, he just couldn\u2019t refuse Xiao Xiaofan and Xiao Xiaodong\u2019s expecting expression for that.Xiao Xiaofan had hardly ever hung around in the fair since childhood, so he was attracted and dazzled by all sorts of goods. So had Xiao Xiaodong, who was looking around with curiosity.When Xiao Jingting came back to the Desert City, he had sold his fields and houses in the Mound Village, and he also had some family property here, so he was quite rich now and willing to purchase for Xiao Xiaofan anything he liked.By seeing Xiao Jingting acting like a spendthrift, Xu Muan said helplessly, \u201cDon\u2019t pamper him like that.\u201dXiao Jingting smiled, \u201cXiaofan is still very young and in an age for fun.\u201dXu Muan smiled, too, and didn\u2019t go on stopping him. Xiaofan had suffered much from birth, which made Xu Muan feel sorry.Xiao Xiaodong pulled a long face and scoffed at any toys liked by Xiao Xiaofan, however, there was some sense of envy deep in his eyes.Looking at Xiao Xiaodong, Xiao Jingting asked, \u201cXiaodong, don\u2019t you want any toy?\u201dWith his hands clasping behind, showing a long face and the chin up, Xiao Xiaodong replied proudly, \u201cI\u2019ve stopped playing with toys long ago.\u201dLooking at Xiao Xiaodong surprisedly, Xiao Xiaofan asked, \u201cBrother, did you have any toy before? Why didn\u2019t I know? Had you played them secretly?\u201dXiao Xiaodong stared at Xiao Xiaofan like his was pissed off, \u201cFool.\u201dVisit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201cPlease stop scolding me, brother. I am not a fool. Even if I become one, you have to take the blame,\u201d Xiao Xiaofan said, depressed.Xiao Xiaodong had nothing to say.This day, Xiao Qingyan woke up with reluctance, by knowing that Xiao Jingting had brought his family to hang out. He had decided to ask Xiao Jingting for some explanation, and now he was even angry with Xiao Jingting.\u2026\u2026Xiao Jingting and Xiao Jinfeng chose a restaurant and took everyone there.Sitting in a restaurant of Desert City again, Xiao Jinfeng felt an otherworldly strangeness.Xiao Xiaofan read the menu and ordered one after another dishes.Xu Muan turned to Xiao Jingting and said, \u201cWe can\u2019t finish so much dishes.\u201dXiao Jingting said disapprovingly, \u201cThat\u2019s OK. We are not always generous like this. And it\u2019s the first time for our son eating here, we should certainly let him have enough.\u201dXu Muan smiled, \u201cAlright.\u201dMu Shuyu said lightly, \u201cI haven\u2019t eaten in such a big restaurant for a long time. I remember the last time was when I still served in the mercenary team\u2026\u201d He stopped suddenly by realizing that it\u2019s an expensive large celebration, and took a glance at Xiao Jinfeng with some guilt.However, Xiao Jinfeng was holding her hands and said, \u201cIt seems you\u2019ve lost a lot of weight, just eat as you can later.\u201dMu Shuyu replied helplessly, \u201cHave I? You\u2019re talking nonsense!\u201dXiao Xiaofu yawned with boredom in Mu Shuyu\u2019s arms.After ordering the dishes, Xiao Xiaofan looking around excitedly.The restaurant served the dishes efficiently and soon the table was put with all kinds of dishes.Mu Shuyu fed Xiao Xiaofu egg custard with a spoon. Seeing that he was too busy for caring the baby to enjoy his meal, Xiao Jinfeng clipped a dumpling and sent it to his mouth, \u201cHave a taste. The dumpling is delicious.\u201dMu Shuyu felt kind of embarrassed with her face turning red, but she also didn\u2019t refuse it.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He\u2019s so cute, and seems he\u2019s a few months old.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s almost three months old.\u201d Knowing Zhou Kanghe was sounding him out, Xiao Jinfeng confessed.\u201cThen Second Childe Xiao and madam could have known each other for a long time.\u201d said Zhou Kanghe.Xiao Jinfeng nodded, looking at Mu Shuyu dotingly, and said, \u201cYeah! We knew each other when we were in the mercenary team. I had saved Shuyu\u2019s life, he had saved mine, too. We are a couple sharing weal and woe.\u201dSun Miaoyin\u2019s face turned red. When the engagement was broken off before, Xiao Jinfeng was considered pitiful by some people, who had lost his charming fianc\u00e9e for a lowborn dancing girl. And he was guessed to be unhappy and would live a lonely life after.However, he soon married another wife within a year and even had their baby already.This time, some people said, Xiao Jinfeng was not good, since he shouldn\u2019t have cheated on Miss Sun when he still had an engagement with her, and as for the baby, it was just going too far.But there was also someone gloated that Sun Miaoyin was nothing, and Xiao Jinfeng had never taken kindly to her, and breaking off the engagement would just hit the spot. Although Miss Sun was both talented and beautiful, Xiao Jinfeng considered her less important than a Ger.\u201cChilde Zhou, seems you\u2019re here for dinner with your wife! The dishes here are very delicious.\u201d Xiao Jingting greeted lazily.Xiao Xiaofan stared at Xiao Jingting and said, \u201cFather, you\u2019ve almost eaten all the dumplings, save some for me!\u201dXiao Jingting bopped Xiao Xiaofan on the head and said, \u201cDon\u2019t be fussy, there are still so many dishes.\u201dXiao Xiaofan give Xiao Jingting a discontent stare, but took his advice anyway.Zhou Kanghe said to Xiao Jingting, \u201cAs the saying going, great progress can be made and one deserve to be treated differently within a short time, Third Childe Xiao does have changed a lot! I didn\u2019t expect you to advance to level five of Qi Practice so soon. When in your age, your elder brother was just at level four. Given your talent, you could have entered the Bifeng Academy.\u201dXiao Jingting smiled, \u201cIt\u2019s just by luck. How can I match you?! You just advance to level six by your own effort. And I\u2019m too old to be admitted to the Bifeng Academy, I just dare not expect that.\u201d\u201cWhat a pity! If Childe Xiao had taken the exam and been admitted to the Bifeng Academy, you could have been cultivated to advance to level six, too!\u201d said Zhou Kanghe.Xiao Jingting smiled, \u201cChilde Zhou are kidding me. It can\u2019t be that easy to advance to level six, or everyone could have achieved it.\u201dZhou Kanghe left with Sun Miaoyin.

I thought since Jinfeng and Jingting have just come back here, you three brothers should have a good chat together.\u201dXiao Qingyan gave him a frosty look, \u201cYou just know all about our family!\u201dXiao Muhong sneered, \u201cI just happened to see them.

I just worry about my sister-in-law and nephew, they may suffer a tough time because of being powerless in Xiao family after you go back to the Academy.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s none of your business. You should care about your wife, who seems to be still hung up on my third brother. My third brother has been different from the one before, anyway. And I saw them talk in the corridor in dark, not knowing what they were chatting about.\u201dXiao Muhong suddenly showed a gloomy face. Xiao Qingyan gave him a sarcastic smile\u2014when his parents were gone and the news was heard, Xiao Muhong had taken the chance to kick him much. Now he was just disgusted at Xiao Muhong\u2019s flattery.Xiao Qingyan took a deep breath. He certainly knew that Xiao Muhong came here intentionally to play him and his two brothers off against each other. But now, Xiao Qingyan still couldn\u2019t help being angry. Finally, Xiao Jingting and Xiao Jinfeng had banded together, and paid no attention to him, this elder brother.Staring at Xiao Qingyan\u2019s back, Xiao Muhong couldn\u2019t help but clenched his fists.After marring to him, Sun Miaomiao had become much more understanding. But by nature, she\u2019s a woman who had a strong character and always adored the powerful one.Xiao Jingting\u2019s change had shocked her much.

Xiao Jingting had said that he would lecture this little fool, but it turned out to he just let his son enjoy nice food and have more toys.Seeing Xiao Qingyan, Xiao Xiaofan hid behind Xiao Jingting hastily.Though Xiao Xiaofan\u00a0was\u00a0not that clever, he still knew how to seek advantages and avoid harms by nature.

Desert City is superior\u00a0to\u00a0countryside, there are so many artifacts and talismans in the store here, but they\u2019re just too expensive.\u201dIn the past, he was too poor to enter such a place. Even when he nerved himself\u00a0to enter the store sometimes, the servers there had no desire to receive him by seeing his shabby look. Sometimes he was even driven out by some of the servers, and was derisively told that such a place was not for a person like him.By experiencing that for some times, Xu Muan could merely stand outside the firm, looking at the dazzling colorful\u00a0posters and banners of advertisement longingly.\u201cI still have\u00a030 or 40 thousand taels\u00a0of silver here, let\u2019s check it someday.\u201d Xiao Jingting said.Xu Muan surprised, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you do that today?\u201dXiao Jingting replied ashamedly, \u201cAs you said, they are big firms, anyway. Things there can be expensive. If we brought Xiaofan there and I could not\u00a0afford\u00a0whatever Xiaofan wanted, it can be embarrassing.\u201dXu Muan felt speechless. So that\u2019s how it\u00a0was\u2026\u201cYou\u2019ve offended the big brother today,\u201d said Xu Muan.Xiao Jingting replied lazily, \u201cWhat do you fear? I\u2019ve offended him already before. But I think it\u2019s strange that, big brother used to mention the Bifeng Academy a lot and be proud of that, but recently he has mentioned less of it.\u201d\u201cMaybe he has had a tough time there,\u201d Xu Muan said.Xiao Jingting nodded, and thought in mind: the Bifeng Academy is\u00a0equivalent\u00a0to an\u00a0elite school in his previous life. Although it\u2019s famous and thus honors its members, but inevitably, there\u2019s strife, too. In his previous life, it\u2019s not uncommon to hear students at Tsinghua and Peking universities commit suicide.\u201cWhat do you know about that?\u201d Xiao Jingting asked.\u201cYour big brother once pursued a miss of a noble family, Ouyang Jing, and now Ouyang Jing has been together with a man in the Academy with level 7 of Qi Practice, and she told him she was pestered by your big brother. Then, that man has asked someone to punish your big brother for her, which makes it hard for your big brother to get along in the Academy.\u201d\u201cFortunately, the Academy has its rules there. Although your big brother was targeted, those people dare not to go too far, and everything will be OK when the dust settles.\u201dVisit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Rubbing his\u00a0chin, Xiao Jingting said, \u201cNo wonder\u00a0big\u00a0brother hasn\u2019t mentioned the Academy recently.\u201d It turned out that he had had a tough time there.Staring at Xu Muan, Xiao Jingting said with a\u00a0twinkle\u00a0in\u00a0his\u00a0eyes, \u201cAlright, stopping talking about him. Let\u2019s go to bed.\u201dLooking into Xiao Jingting\u2019s shiny black eyes, Xu Muan couldn\u2019t help blushing.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201cThird childe, some guests are visiting you.\u201d When Xiao Jingting got up, a servant came in and reported.\u201cWho are they?\u201d asked Xiao Jingting.\u201cThe childe of Sun family, Sun Qi and the childe of Zheng family, Zheng Liming,\u201d said the servant.Xiao Jingting showed a helpless facial expression. The coming ones were the bad friends of the previous Xiao Jingitng! As they said, a\u00a0good guy always has three\u00a0fellows. So do a dandy! The difference is, the fellows of a good guy are indeed friends in need, while the fellows of a dandy are bad friends who will escape when he is in distress.Shaking his head, Xu Muan said, \u201cFinally, they come! Though a bit later than I expected.\u201dIn a big family, there are always some rotten apples who rest on their laurels and live a life of drinking and mistresses. The previous Xiao Jingting, Sun Qi and Zheng Liming were all that kind of person.The difference was, Xiao Jingting was a\u00a0direct\u00a0descendant\u00a0of\u00a0the Xiao family, while Sun Qi and Zheng Liming, belonging to Sun family and Zheng family, were just collateral\u00a0relatives of the Xiao family, so they had much lower position and inferior\u00a0treatment than Xiao Jingting. And whenever they hung out together, almost every time Xiao Jingting was the one paying the bills.When the original Xiao Jingting was in distress, he once put\u00a0down\u00a0his vanity and sought\u00a0help\u00a0from those two, but just obtained no response.Rubbing his fingers, Xiao Jingting said, \u201cSince they have left us in distress at that time, so shameless\u00a0they\u2019re by flattering us now.\u201dXu Muan smiled. It\u2019s just so normal for this world to adore the powerful one while look down upon the weak one.\u201cDo you want to receive them?\u201d asked Xu Muan.Xiao Jingting shrugged\u00a0and said, \u201cThey\u2019re coming, anyway, we have to manage to\u00a0send them away.\u201dXiao Jingting and Xu Muan walked out. Seeing Xiao Jingting, Sun Qi was very excited, \u201cBrother Xiao, haven\u2019t seen you for a long time, and I miss you so much!\u201dXiao Jingting gave him a titter, \u201cReally? Why haven\u2019t you gone to Mound Village to see me?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You\u2019re free now. Recently I\u2019ve visited you, but your servant said you\u2019re closing yourself in the door to practice\u00a0Qi and would not go out until you advance to level four. But I find your cultivation now\u2026\u201d was still at level three!Sun Qi gave a hollow laugh, \u201cI\u2019m not as talented as you are, and although I\u2019ve closed myself to practice for several months, I just have no achievement. But you\u2019re thriving, brother Xiao, since you\u2019ve advanced to level five at such a young age. As far as I can\u00a0see, you\u2019ll surely advance to level nine in the future and have tremendous\u00a0sway\u00a0in this\u00a0region.\u201dXiao Jingting waved his hand and said, \u201cI dare not expect that. I just want to make my living.\u201dSeeing Xiao Jingting being quite indifferent, Sun Qi felt embarrassed.\u201cBrother Xiao, since you don\u2019t always have the chance to come back, let\u2019s give you a party in the Cuiwei Hotel,\u201d said Zheng Liming.Xiao Jingting rubbed\u00a0his forehead. How could he suggest to hold a party in a brothel in front of his wife?Xu Muan stared at Sun Qi with an unhappy look, \u201cYou two needn\u2019t to be that\u00a0polite. Cuiwei Hotel is an expensive place. Just save your money.\u201dZheng Liming frowned\u00a0at Xu Muan and then turned to Xiao Jingting. Obviously, he just thought\u00a0nothing\u00a0of and ignored Xu Muan.Xiao Jingting gave a glance to Xu Muan and replied, \u201cI\u2019ll follow Muan\u2019s idea.\u201dZheng Liming said surprisedly, \u201cBrother Xiao, are you going to get self-cultivation? Lady Jin Hong in Cuiwei Hotel misses you and has once inquired about\u00a0you.\u00a0Since your leaving last time, she has been sad for you for a long time.\u201dXiao Jingting narrowed his eyes. In his impression, Jin Hong was not a young lady, and usually dressed up vulgarly. Once she had been a famous one, but now her day was gone.She\u2019s a lady with appeal and knew how to coax people, so the previous Xiao Jingting, such a simple guy, used to be fascinated by her. With such a simple but rich guy leaving, how could she not be sad\u2026Xiao Jingting couldn\u2019t understand the taste of the original body owner by being fond of such a lady. Recalling\u00a0what the original body owner had done, he just felt headache. God, why was him reborn into such a person!\u201cLady Jin Hong\u2019s guests are just too many, how could she still remember me? You\u2019re kidding me,\u201d said Xiao Jingting.\u201cNo, you\u2019re wrong, Jingting. You\u2019re special to her.\u201dXu Muan snorted\u00a0in\u00a0disgust and said coldly, \u201cWhy do\u00a0you\u00a0have to\u00a0introduce to Jingting such a whore being played with by numerous\u00a0people? What are you up to? If there\u2019s nothing else, just leave here.\u201d\u201dSun Qi was stunned and stared at Xu Muan surprisedly, then focused his eyes on Xiao Jingting, suggested\u00a0him to control\u00a0Xu Muan.Fondling the\u00a0ring on his hand, Xiao Jingting ignored Sun Qi\u2019s eyes. Sun Qi then looked at Xu Muan surprisedly, as if he just knew him right now.\u201cIt\u2019s really hard for Jingting to accept your kindness. Just enjoy that lady Jin Hong by yourselves. Jingting\u2019s cultivation is unstable now and he needs a close-door cultivation. Don\u2019t come to visit him if there\u2019s nothing serious,\u201d Xu Muan said furiously.\u201cMuan, how could you say that?\u201d Sun Qi said discontentedly.\u201cHe\u2019s right. I\u2019m going to close myself to practice,\u201d Xiao Jingting said.\u201cBrother Xiao, you\u2019re kidding.\u201d Generally speaking, only the one having advanced to level eight or nine needed to close oneself to practice.\u201cI\u2019m not. Since it\u2019s reasonable for you two to close yourselves to practice with level three, then why can\u2019t I? I\u2019m at level five.\u201dSun Qi and Zheng Liming felt quite embarrassed. After responding few words, they escaped.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201cBah, what a snob he is! Just forgets us once becomes flourishing.\u201d As soon as walked out the Xiao family, Sun Qi turned into another person right away.\u201cGiven that even a guy like Xiao Jingting can become a\u00a0hen-pecked husband, I can\u2019t understand what has Xu Muan done to him,\u201d Zheng Liming said surprisingly.\u201cHe used to think nothing of Xu Muan, and avoid mentioning Xu Muan by feeling sick. But he just became hen-pecked after once wandering outside and returning. It\u2019s just every strange thing could happen these days.\u201dVisit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201cI heard that after Xiao Jingting was slung\u00a0out\u00a0of\u00a0the Xiao family, he could only\u00a0live alone\u00a0with\u00a0Xu Muan, thus they became close.\u201d\u201cXu Muan just knew how to push his luck. With a lack of beauty in a countryside like that, Xu Muan could be appreciated by Xiao Jingting. After a few days, when Xiao Jingting regained his bad old habits, he\u2019ll even has nowhere to cry.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true. He just thinks highly of himself though he was the bastard of a lowborn.\u201dBefore, Xiao Jingting, Sun Qi and Zheng Liming always played around together, and because Xiao Jingting was the most favored and the most well-off one, he was the leader among them.Sun Qi pretended\u00a0to\u00a0be\u00a0respectful\u00a0to Xiao Jingting in front of him, but actually he was very\u00a0jealous about Xiao Jingting. When Xiao Jingting\u2019s parents were gone and he was slung\u00a0out\u00a0of\u00a0the Xiao family, Sun Qi was extremely gloating, considered this bastard to be finally doomed.But he didn\u2019t expect Xiao Jingting\u2019s parents still to be alive and Xiao Jingting to advance to level five of Qi Practice.\u201cWhat a pity. I can\u2019t understand how could he achieve level five of Qi Practice.\u201d\u201cI heard that\u2019s all by luck. He has discovered some Heaven Wealth and Land Treasure spiritual plant in the wood near the Mound Village, which helps him advance.\u201d\u201cHow could that black sheep obtain such a good luck,\u201d Zheng Liming said jealously.\u201cYeah.\u201d Sun Qi went green-eyed.\u201cSince he could find Heaven Wealth and Land Treasure in the wood near the Mound Village, let\u2019s check there out some time as well.\u201d Zheng Liming suggested.Sun Qi showed a sad\u00a0smile, \u201cDo you think only you know that? The secret of Xiao Jingting achieving level five by the help of Heaven Wealth and Land Treasure has been known all around, and the great four families have all sent their people to that wood to check, and they do have discovered some spiritual plants, but all of which are normal species.\u201dAfter Sun Qi and Zheng Liming left, Xiao Jingting got relieved. What kind of person the previous him was, just made friend with such bad guys!\u201cMuan, you\u2019ve done an excellent job just now.\u201d Xiao Jingting said to Xu Muan.Xu Muan smiled helplessly. How things change! He had never thought that one day he would be able to righteously\u00a0scold the bad friends of Xiao Jingting.\u201cYou have a number of such friends,\u201d Xu Muan said.Xiao Jingting tittered, \u201cUnless they never come, once they come, just kick them out.\u201d When the previous Xiao Jingting was in distress, none of those bad friends had ever lent a hand.\u201cAren\u2019t you afraid of affecting your reputation?\u201d asked Xu Muan.Xiao Jingting said disapprovingly, \u201cWhy? I don\u2019t have a reputation, anyway.\u201dXu Muan felt wordless. That\u2019s just true!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In Sun Miaomiao\u2019s impression, Xu Muan was a little gloomy, always dressed in a suit of coarse clothes. But now, although his clothes were simple, they were not low-end, and moreover, he looked somewhat bright like sunshine.\u201cXu Muan, are you going out?\u201d asked Sun Miaomiao as she went close to Xu Muan.Xu Muan was surprised to come cross Sun Miaomiao. Xu Muan had seen Sun Miaomiao several times before. And when she met him, Sun Miaomiao had always skewed at him, but had never said hello to him.\u201cYes! I\u2019m short of things at home. I need to go out and buy some,\u201d replied Xu Muan.\u201cI\u2019ve heard that Xiao Jingting is totally obedient to you. Such a playboy like Xiao Jingting is unexpectedly well-behaved. You are really a man of ability,\u201d Sun Miaomiao highly praised.When Sun Qi and Zheng Liming left, they went everywhere and said that Xiao Jingting became a hen-pecked husband who was obedient to his wife and always followed her advice. He did not dare to do anything his wife did not allow him to do and he could do nothing but follow her orders. He would never go on the racket.Xiao Jingting was sensitive about his reputation. He might become ashamed into anger and do something outrageous if he knew that he was well known as a hen-pecked husband.Xu Muan smiled and said, \u201cI cannot take all the credit. For a period of time in Mound Village, Xiao Jingting was well-behaved as he lived from hand to mouth.\u201d\u201cIt seems that you have suffered a lot in Mound Village!\u201d said Sun Miaomiao with full of sympathy.\u201cIt was a lot of pain, but a blessing in disguise,\u201d said Xu Muan.Hearing that from Xu Muan, Sun Miaomiao immediately thought of Heaven Wealth and Land Treasure in the forests near Mound Village, \u201cCongratulations, Xu Muan, you are really blessed.\u201d\u201cThank you, and I have to leave you alone,\u201d said Xu Muan.Sun Miaomiao nodded and said, \u201cSee you.\u201dSun Miaomiao\u2019s face became gloomy as she looked at Xu Muan\u2019s back. Xiao Jingting was very cold to Sun Miaomiao when he came back. It was impossible for Sun Miaomiao to accept the fact that she was beaten by a man.\u201cWhy did you come so late?\u201d asked Xiao Jingting casually as he waited at the door for Xu Muan.\u201cI met Sun Miaomiao, and I was delayed for a while,\u201d said Xu Muan.\u201cOh,\u201d Xiao Jingting nodded.\u201cIs there anyone else to come?\u201d asked Xu Muan.Xiao Jingting nodded and said, \u201cWell, I have to wait for Second Brother. I don\u2019t have good taste and good eyes. I will ask him for a favor as he comes soon.\u201dXu Muan nodded and said, \u201cYou are right. When will Second Brother arrive?\u201d\u201cHe may be here soon after he helped Mu Shuyu settle down,\u201d said Xiao Jingting.Xu Muan smiled and said, \u201cSecond Brother has a good relationship with Shuyu.\u201dXiao Jingting nodded and said, \u201cExactly.\u201d\u201cSorry to keep you waiting,\u201d said Xiao Jinfeng as he walked out.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d said Xiao Jingting.\u201cShall we go, brother?\u201d asked Xu Muan.Xiao Jingting nodded and said, \u201cOK!\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026They were immediately received by a trained clerk after Xiao Jingting, Xu Muan and Xiao Jinfeng entered a commercial house.\u201cThis collection of storage rings, which are all built by Master Zhao Li, are beautifully designed and have an internal space of 150 square meters. The space structure is very stable. They are very convenient to install preys in the wild. It\u2019s worth twelve thousand taels of silver for each.\u201dXiao Jingting rubbed his nose and said to himself, \u2018twelve thousand taels, how expensive it is!\u2019 He had thought he was a rich man, but suddenly he found he was poor indeed!\u201cMasters, do you prefer anything?\u201d asked the receptionist.Xiao Jingting cleared his throat, pretending to be calm, \u201cShow us something else.\u201dIn fact, Xiao Jinfeng was satisfied, but he was scared off as he thought of the price. In the wild, they would fight a quick battle. Being afraid the blood would attract other monster beasts, sometimes, they only picked up the most valuable parts of the monster beast as they killed them. It would be wasteful. But it would be different if they had a storage ring. However, a storage ring was too expensive. Generally, a mercenary member used a store bag.After taking one more look at the space storage rings, Xiao Jinfeng turned to other items.\u201cThese are talismans. The talismans in our shop are high-quality. These are level 4 talismans, these are level 5 talismans, and these are level 6 talismans. The selling price for a level 4 talisman is around one hundred taels of silver, a level 5 talisman is around two hundred taels of silver, and a level 6 talisman is around four hundred taels of silver. A talisman is necessary in case that you come across a senior monster beast in the wild. Sometimes one more talisman means you have one more life!\u201d said the receptionist.Thinking of Xiao Jingting\u2019s improper use of talismans to waste large amount of money, Xu Muan felt heartbroken.\u201cWe won\u2019t be fighting in the near future. Show us something else,\u201d said Xu Muan.The receptionist smiled and said, \u201cMasters, please go to have a look at the high-end magic tools. We have recently got a new one, which is very suitable for Master Xiao Jingting.\u201dXu Muan smiled and said, \u201cSounds good!\u201d Xu Muan had not seen many advanced magic tools, but he wanted to gain some experience even though they were not affordable.\u201cFollow me, please.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Childe Xiao, when you display the technique of Growth of All Things, you can expand the scope of the technique by half with the help of this pagoda, as well as other magic techniques.\u201d\u201cThe material used to build the pagoda is very tough. The pagoda can be enlarged. If you encounter a monster you can\u2019t cope with, you can hide in the pagoda. The pagoda will completely cover up the breath of a friar. After a long time, the monster will go away, and it means that you have one more life.\u201d The spiritual pagoda was specially built for spiritual planters. Many spiritual planters were not good at fighting, so the Qi practitioners carefully developed this function.\u201cThis pagoda is also a magic tool that can be used for battle, where you will be able to fight against a person as a level 8 Qi practitioner or even as a level 9 Qi practitioner. This magic tool is actually a semi-finished product. If there is a chance, Childe Xiao can upgrade it.\u201dHearing that, Xiao Jingting was excited as his eyes glowed, \u201cWhat a good magic tool, it must be expensive.\u201d\u201cIt costs one hundred and twenty thousand taels of silver, but it can be paid in installments, with some interest. Childe Xiao can register for a silver card with a down payment of thirty thousand taels of silver. From now on, you can transfer ten thousand taels of silver every month for ten consecutive months.\u201dXiao Jingting was surprised to hear that there was something high-end like installment in this world, but very soon, Xiao Jingting figured it out, because Wasteland Continent had a much longer history than the earth. It was not surprising that there was instalment after such a long time. With a down payment of thirty thousand taels and ten thousand taels of silver every month for ten consecutive months, it meant one hundred and thirty thousand in all, and he had to pay twelve thousand taels of silver more. The seller was very greedy.\u201cChilde Xiao, this magic tool is made by a base-period friar, and we only have one in our shop. If you need it, buy it quickly. If you are too late, someone else will take it away, and you will lose it.\u201dLooking at the attentive smile on the face of the receptionist, Xiao Jingting felt like his heart had been scratched by a cat.Xiao Jinfeng said to Xiao Jingting, \u201cJingting, this pagoda is very suitable for you.\u201d It was really expensive, but it could be used for a long time. Xiao Jingting had amazing ability to make money when he was a level 4 Qi practitioner. As a level 5 Qi practitioner now, he must have the ability to make more silver.Xu Muan looked at Xiao Jingting and said, \u201cYou can buy it if you like it.\u201dXiao Jingting nodded and said, \u201cAll right.\u201dXiao Jingting made a hard decision, and he bought the spiritual pagoda.The receptionist was surprised that Xiao Jingting bought the pagoda.The receptionist did not expect Xiao Jingting to buy the pagoda. He said so much to Xiao Jingting because he hoped Xiao Jingting could mention the magic tool to Xiao Linfeng and Wang Lu when he came back home, and he thought Xiao Linfeng and Wang Lu might be interested in this magic tool.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201cXiao Jinfeng,\u201d A voice of doubt and uncertainty passed over. Xiao Jinfeng turned his head, and he frowned up.Xiao Jingting turned and saw several people coming closer, who were dressed as mercenaries. He immediately guessed out their identity. What a small world!Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Hua Yufeng, the team leader, looked at Xiao Jinfeng seriously. With dodging glances, the other mercenaries behind Hua Yufeng also looked at Xiao Jinfeng.\u201cMaster Jingting, this is your VIP card. You are already a golden VIP of our firm. When you buy anything later, you will get a 5% discount. Welcome here next time.\u201d said the receptionist full of hospitality.Xiao Jingting twisted his face and said to himself, \u2018This firm really does not know how to do business. Things are so expensive and the discount is so low. They should have given me a 20% discount.\u2019When Hua Yufeng heard what the clerk said, he was stunned for a moment. According to the rules of the firm, those who consumed more than 1,000 taels of silver were ordinary members, those who consumed more than 12,000 taels of silver were silver members, those who consumed more than 100,000 taels were gold members, and those who consumed more than 1,000,000 taels were violet gold members.Hua Yufeng was a silver member. Hua Yufeng could not help but envy as he suddenly heard Xiao Jingting was a gold member.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Xiao Jinfeng said to Xiao Jingting and Xu Muan.As Xiao Jingting nodded, three of them went out together. Xiao Jinfeng did not say a word to Hua Yufeng and others from beginning to end.\u201cAre those your former teammates, Second Brother?\u201d asked Xiao Jingting as they left the shop.Xiao Jinfeng nodded and said, \u201cYes!\u201dXiao Jinfeng had early known that he would meet those people when he came back to Desert City, and he had imagined what would happen when they met each other. He had thought it would be very uncomfortable, but he found that it was alright when they really met. All the past was past.\u201cSecond Brother, the leading man had a face of ingratitude. It is good that you were driven out, otherwise, sooner or later he will get you into trouble,\u201d said Xiao Jingting. Xiao Jingting asked about current situation of the mercenary team. The mercenary team under the leadership of Hua Yufeng had been on the decline. Many members had quit the mercenary team.Xiao Jinfeng smiled. Hua Yufeng was good looking, but his temper was\u2026\u201cWell, it\u2019s all in the past,\u201d said Xiao Jinfeng. He was not a pedantically good man.

The mercenary team who made a great deal only got thousands of taels of silver, and 10 thousand taels of silver at most. But this childe could afford one hundred thousand taels, which was very enviable!\u201cHow does Xiao Jingting have so much silver? He was not that wealthy before, was he? We are brothers in the team, so we all get about the same salary, right?\u201d\u201cMaybe he pretends to be a poor man. Noble childes like him can get large amounts of money as long as he sweettalks their seniors. He is rich enough but still shares the harvest,\u201d Hua Yufeng said jealously.Looking at Hua Yufeng, Zhou Fang thought to himself, \u201cXiao Jinfeng spared no efforts to do the job, didn\u2019t he? And he should take his share. It seems Hua Yufeng bores Xiao Jinfeng a grudge.\u201d Thinking that he had to work under Hua Yufeng\u2019s hand, Zhou Fang didn\u2019t say a good word for Xiao Jinfeng.Zhao Li nodded and replied, \u201cYes! Good Job, we weren\u2019t born in a family as rich as him! But one hundred thousand taels of silver is not a small number, so even for the parents of Xiao Jingting, it is a great loss. If Xiao Jing\u2019s father is unwilling to pay the bill for Xiao Jingting, then he would be in great trouble again.\u201dTrading company had their own dun group and if you didn\u2019t repay in time, they would come to collect the money, using cruel means.\u201cWhat is he afraid of? His father will help him anyway,\u201d Hua Yufeng said.\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d Zhao Li answered.\u201cXiao Jinfeng has practiced into the fifth level,\u201d Zhang Meng said.Zhao Li nodded and said, \u201cAmazing. He has practiced into the fifth level in a short time.\u201dXiao Jinfeng was prestigious in the mercenary team. The reason why Xiao Jinfeng was chased out of the mercenary team was partly because Xiao Jinfeng was poisoned and for this, he lost the chance to achieve a higher level. The member in the mercenary team had to support their family and it need them to risk their lives to fight with the demonic beast. The mercenary team didn\u2019t need encumbrances.Within a year, Xiao Jinfeng had practiced into the fourth level and was going to achieve the fifth level.Hua Yufeng clenched his fist. Before Xiao Jinfeng left the team, some people began to miss his warm heart, and someone else proposed to ask Xiao Jinfeng back. Looking at the attitude of Xiao Jinfeng, he realized that even though he went to invite him back by himself, Xiao Jinfeng wouldn\u2019t come back.Actually, when Xiao Jinfeng left, Hua Yufeng was a little regretful, the mercenary team lost a cheap hatchet man, so the rate of completing tasks declined sharply. What\u2019s worse, recently the mercenary team couldn\u2019t make their ends meet and members became less and less satisfied with him, and thus Hua Yufeng got much more pressure.Sometimes, Hua Yufeng was missing the day working with Xiao Jinfeng. During that time, although Xiao Jinfeng often threw his weight around, he could finish his task successfully.\u2026In the trading company.\u201cXiao Jingting is super rich! He spent one hundred thousand taels to buy a magical weapon. Even though the friar who practiced into the seventh and the eighth level won\u2019t spend money that handsomely.\u201d\u201cHe is born with a silver spoon, so he can ask his daddy for help if he couldn\u2019t get enough money to repay.\u201d\u201cThe Spiritual Tower is not bad. It is said that this magical weapon is designed to be used in the Foundation Establishment. But as a result, when refining, there was something wrong, so its level was lowered down. But the material was costly.\u201dVisit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201cBut it is a defective weapon anyway!\u201d\u201cIt has been put here for many days but some elders of big clans who had cultivated into the seventh level weren\u2019t willing to buy it. Unexpectedly, Xiao Jingting bought it finally.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dXiao Jingting\u2019s generosity became the hot topic discussed by others in the trading company.The minute Sun Qi and Zheng Liming went into the trading company, they heard people\u2019s amazement at Xiao Jingting\u2019s generosity.\u201cMan, I have never thought he is that rich.\u201d Sun Qi was speechless. Although Xiao Jingting used to be richer than them, the difference hadn\u2019t been that large. Sometimes, he would buy a gift of seven or eight hundred taels of silver for Miss Sun. And that was the high limit.One hundred thousand taels of silver for the pagoda? How come he became so loaded?\u201cWhat a lucky dog!\u201d Zheng Liming answered jealously.\u201cHe picked up the gold, didn\u2019t he?\u201d Sun Qi answered, although Xiao Jingting only paid the down payment, it also should be a great sum of money.Zheng Liming answered jealously, \u201cNo, but he picked up the Heaven Wealth and Land Treasure. Man, he must find more than one Heaven Wealth and Land Treasure!\u201dSun Qi nodded and said, \u201cIt makes senses.\u201dSun Qi felt it a great pity and Xiao Jingting became much more indifferent since they came back this time. If it were in the past, he should get a lot of benefits. Since Xiao Jingting now had a lot of money, he could have profited from him easily. Sun Qi was very regretful that if he had known Xiao Jingting would ask for his help, he would have given him dozens of taels of silver and he wouldn\u2019t be so awkward.\u201cThe guy only paid for three hundred taels of silver as down payment and later he has much money to repay. Will he ask his parents to repay for him? Although Xiao Jingting was favored. However, his father\u2019s favorite son is Xiao Qingyan, whose pocket money is less than ten thousand taels of silver.\u201d Zheng Liming muttered.\u201cHe has already bought it and can\u2019t return it. So, his parents must repay for him. They won\u2019t watch him being beaten to death by the creditor and do nothing, will they?\u201d Sun Qi said.Zheng Liming nodded, saying, \u201cWell, that\u2019s true.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

But Xiao Jingting paid much attention to the goods and didn\u2019t see her, while Sun Miaoyin didn\u2019t great them, either.Thinking of Xiao Jinfeng, the man who had been engaged with her, Sun Miaoyin thought he at least had an imposing appearance and not as terrible as she imagined.Sun Miaoyin shook her hand and even though Xiao Jinfeng was not bad, he still couldn\u2019t match up for Zhou Kang.Xiao Jingting was very generous. He bought the spiritual pagoda of one hundred thousand taels of silver without hesitation.Sun Miaoyin thought of her younger sister\u2019s words: Xiao Jingting was like a toad lusting after a swan\u2019s flesh but he didn\u2019t want to spend much money to buy a gift for her. She, Sun Miaomiao, was not easily satisfied. If Xiao Jingting sent this Pagoda to her sister, perhaps her sister would have feelings for him.\u2026Xiao Jingting fondled this Spiritual Towel admiringly, for he liked it the in the first eye and bought it finally.Xiao Jingting also felt joyful when seeing the Spiritual Pagoda but found it a bit expensive. After buying the pagoda, he was in debt again.Xiao Jingting put away the Spiritual Pagoda and hung out with Xiao Jinfeng and Xu Muan in the street. At that time, a guard came in a hurry.\u201cMisters, please go back home, young master Xiaofan is fighting with others again.\u201dXiao Jingting, \u201c\u2026\u201d He just came back few days but his youngest son was fighting with others again.Xiao Jingting hurried back home and, in the lobby, Xiao Xiaofan hid himself behind Mu Shuyu and looked at other kids indignantly.\u201cThird Brother, finally you\u2019re back. Your son\u2019s behavior became more and more terrible. He should guide the demonic beast to attack his cousin. What a bad boy!\u201dXiao Jingting looked at Xiao Xiaofan, while Xiao Xiaofan looked very angry and retorted, \u201cDaddy, no. I asked Fire Cloud Bird to take me to fly, but they took the arrows to shoot it. So the Bird scratched them out of angry.\u201d\u201cYour cousins are playing games with you, but you tried to hurt them severely, and now you tell on them first.\u201d Zheng Pei\u2019er answered relentlessly.\u201cThey weren\u2019t playing games, but wanted to kill me by the arrows. The bird was hurt by them,\u201d Xiao Xiaofan answered.No children in Xiao family had a demonic beast like Xiaofan. The minute Xiao Yuerong saw Xiao Xiaofan was riding the demonic beast, he thought of the grudge with him so he was so angry that he guided other children to shoot toward the Fire Cloud Bird. But it was a baby bird, so it panicked when it was hurt and almost threw Xiaofan away.Xiao Xiaofan was shocked but the Fire Cloud Bird calmed down soon. However, the bird under attack became furious and rushed at the children on the ground, but was blocked by some patrolling guards.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Hearing Xiao Xiaofan\u2019s defend, Xiao Jingting was indignant, \u201cSister-in-law, my son was riding the demonic beast to fly in the sky, how can your son shoot him? If you hurt the demonic beast, my son will fall down from the sky. Your son is a murderer! Why do you blame my son? You shameless shrew, what a glib tongue you have! Shame on you!\u201d If Xiaofan fell down from the sky, he would be hurt seriously if not dead.Zheng Pei\u2019er was rebuked by Xiao Jingting and her whole body trembled with anger, \u201cThird Brother, what do you mean by saying that? Your son didn\u2019t get hurt but my son.\u201d\u201cHe deserves to suffer loss! He was ill-intentioned, and he had to eat his own bitter fruit. Sister-in-law, my nephew had wound in his head, why was he allowed to run wild\uff1fDo you teach him to bully the younger one?\u201d Xiao Jingting said angrily.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Zheng Pei\u2019er was going nuts when hearing Xiao Jingting\u2019s words.\u201cEnough. Only trifles and nothing seriously. Forget it.\u201d Xiao Qingyan answered.Hearing Xiao Qingyan\u2019s words, Zheng Pei\u2019er glared at Xiao Qingyan while Zheng Pei\u2019er shut up reluctantly when seeing Xiao Qingyan\u2019s expression.Xiao Jingting looked at Xiao Qingyan surprisingly, for he couldn\u2019t understand why his elder brother could let him go that easily.\u201cThird Brother, I heard that you spending one hundred taels of silver but bought a useless magical weapon,\u201d Xiao Qingyan asked.Xiao Jingting, \u201c\u2026\u201d He was curious why Xiao Qingyan was so clam. His elder brother was waiting for him on this matter.\u201cIt costs one hundred taels of silver, but I have no much money but paid for three thousand yuan and I will repay it later.\u201d Xiao Jingting answered.Xiao Qingyan squinted to see and said silently, He thought Xiao Jingting had got rid of the bad habit of being a spendthrift, but unexpectedly he was further intensified. He bought the magical weapons of one hundred thousand taels of silver without hesitation. But his own magical weapon was just a Green Cloud Sword of ten thousand taels of silver, and the quality of this sword was admired by many others.\u201cThird Brother. You are so generous when buying magical weapons.\u201d Xiao Qingyan said.Xiao Linfeng and Wang Lu was gloomy these days. One hundred thousand taels of silver? Of course, they could pay it but it was still a large sum of money for them.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I just bought the pagoda and you\u2019ve known it so soon.\u201d Xiao Jingting sneered.\u201cThere are not many big customers like you, brother. So that people are pleased to talk about it, and naturally the news spreads fast,\u201d said Xiao Qingyan.Xiao Qingyan said to himself, \u2018Xiao Jingting bought the magic tool in installments, and he must count on his parents to pay the rest. If his parents do not pay the money, Xiao Jingting will be caught by the store and go to prison. Of course, his parents will not stand by without doing anything. His monthly allowance from the parents is only five or six pieces of spiritual jade, one or two thousand taels of silver, which adds up to about three thousand taels of silver.Xiao Jingting have to pay back ten thousand taels of silver every month to buy the magic tool. Is Xiao Jingting going to force his parents to spend money on him by buying the tool? It\u2019s unacceptable.\u2019Wang Lu looked at Xiao Jingting and sighed, \u201cJingting, you are too immoderate. How can you spend so much money? How do you plan to pay back your silver later on?\u201dXiao Jingting said slowly and gently, \u201cI am going to ask father and mother to give me some farmland. When I was in Mound Village, I was used to working at sunrise and retiring at sunset. I am not used to the life as I have nothing to do these days. Mother, you give me a few pieces of farmland, so I can farm the land and pay back the money.\u201dXiao Jingting said to himself, \u2018At first, the original body owner\u2019s aunt even gave him a lot of farmland when he was expelled. As the parents of the original body owner, they cannot be stingy.\u2019\u201cDo you want some farmland? The farmland of Xiao\u2019s Family is located outside the city, which is not close to home!\u201d said Wang Lu.Xiao Jingting nodded and said, \u201cI know that. Once I have some farmland, I will take Muan and my son to build a house and live there. My son is too wild. He is not going the right way with the two sons of my eldest brother. I am afraid he will fight all day if he stays here in Xiao\u2019s Family, which will be a problem.\u201dWhat Xiao Jingting said was not expected by Wang Lu, who was astonished to hear that, \u201cAre you going to move out?\u201dXiao Jingting nodded and said, \u201cIt is better to move out and take care of the farmland. Since I went out this time, I have found that I have a good talent in farming. If I work harder, I believe that I can manage to pay back the money. In fact, the down payment of 30,000 taels of silver is earned from farming.\u201dA look of shame came over the face of Xiao Linfeng, and Wang Lu was also eased down.Xiao Qingyan frowned with a cold sniff and said, \u201cThird Brother, do you think everyone is a fool? You are just a level 5 Qi practitioner, and you were much lower before. How can you earn so much money from farming? You sold out all the items of Heaven Wealth and Land Treasure you have found, didn\u2019t you?\u201dXiao Jingting threw his eyes on Xiao Qingyan and said, \u201cI did sell some items of Heaven Wealth and Land Treasure, but most of the money were earned from farming.\u201dXiao Qingyan ignored the last part of what Xiao Jingting said. Hearing that Xiao Jingting really sold some items of Heaven Wealth and Land Treasure, he became furious, \u201cYou really sold some treasures. What\u2019s wrong with you? How dare you did this!\u201dXiao Jingting took it for granted and said, \u201cI had no money, and I had to sell something. According to the rule, I would pay a fine of silver of a month for the superior farmland given by my aunt if it was wasted for one month, and I had to pay much money as it had been deserted for a long time. I would not have paid the fine if I had not sold some items of Heaven Wealth and Land Treasure.\u201dVisit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Xiao Jingting looked innocent as he turned to Liu Xian as a bystander.Liu Xian had been enjoying what was going on. She felt embarrassed as Xiao Jingting blamed on her.Wang Lu threw her eyes full of hatred on Liu Xian.Liu Xian smiled awkwardly and said, \u201cJingting, what did you say? Was the farmland deserted when you got it? How could such good farmland be deserted? I know nothing about it!\u201d\u201cI had to pay a fine for the deserted farmland, and there are monster beasts who often haunt the farmland. Aunt, you must be cheated to give such farmland to me. I\u2019m lucky to have the help of Second Brother, otherwise the farmland would have been destroyed by the monster beasts even it is planted with spiritual plants,\u201d said Xiao Jingting coldly.Wang Lu sniffed with an even worse look on her face.\u201cAunt, how can you give such farmland to me? I was cheated by Hou\u2019s Family for the farmland. They took two thousand taels of silver from me. Aunt, please remember to give this money to me! You have been cheated into giving me such farmland, and being your nephew, I had to pay so much money for you. It is unfair!\u201d said Xiao Jingting righteously.Under Wang Lu\u2019s stares, Liu Xian could only make a promise, \u201cThis is my fault. I will pay the money for you.\u201dLiu Xian gritted her teeth. At first, she was complacent to transfer the farmland to Xiao Jingting, which would be fined. She did not expect Xiao Jingting to ask her for the money.Xiao Jingting was gratified to hear what his aunt said. In fact, he only paid a fine of one thousand and five hundred taels of silver. Xiao Jingting asked more for five hundred taels of silver. Two thousand taels of silver did not mean a lot for Xiao Jingting now, but this was also a big money.Xiao Qingyan didn\u2019t care what Xiao Jingting had experienced in Mound Village. He only cared about Heaven Wealth and Land Treasure.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

There are profiteers everywhere, and you are easy to be cheated,\u201d asked Xiao Qingyan irreconcilably. If Xiao Jingting sold the treasures to a town near Mound Village, he might have a chance to get them back. There was no master at all in such a small town.\u201cWith the help of Second Brother, I sold them to a big commercial house in Windy City.\u201d replied Xiao Jingting.\u201cWindy City.\u201d It seemed that something reminded Xiao Qingyan. Suddenly Xiao Qingyan opened his eyes widely. He looked at Xiao Jinfeng and asked, \u201cJinfeng, you were to sell the treasures when I met you in Windy City that time, weren\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Xiao Jinfeng nodded.Xiao Qingyan was very unhappy and said, \u201cWe are brothers, why didn\u2019t you tell me about such a big deal?\u201dXiao Jinfeng sneered and said, \u201cBig Brother, I was to tell you about it, but you did not give me a chance to speak out! You said \u2018don\u2019t call me Big Brother, I don\u2019t have a brother as shameless as you\u2019. And you also asked me to get out of Windy City as soon as I could, and not to give you any trouble. I followed your orders, and as soon as I sold out the spiritual plants, I left Windy City.\u201dXiao Qingyan felt embarrassed and uneasy as he listened.Xiao Jingting looked at Xiao Jinfeng and said to himself, \u2018There are more cases of icing on the cake, but less cases of giving timely help. Xiao Jinfeng was at a low point when he met Xiao Qingyan, and Xiao Jinfeng should have had a lot of expectations from Xiao Qingyan at that time, but\u2026\u2019Xiao Qingyan, unsympathetic to his brother in distress, was really a bad guy.Looking at Xiao Jinfeng\u2019s cold side face, Xiao Qingyan was angry about Xiao Jinfeng\u2019s ruthlessness, and he still felt regretful that he treated Xiao Jinfeng too badly. If he had a better attitude to him at that time, perhaps, Xiao Jinfeng would have taken the treasures out, and maybe, he would have been a level 6 Qi practitioner.Recently, he was often praised that there were three talents in his family, who were all level 5 Qi practitioners, and he even heard a tongue-in-cheek statement that he had to work harder, otherwise he would be caught up with and surpassed by his brothers.Xiao Jinfeng and Xiao Jingting had been promoted to level 5 Qi practitioners, which gave Xiao Qingyan great pressure.Xiao Qingyan was very worried that he would be surpassed by his two younger brothers. He had been the most excellent one in the family since he was born. He would become the laughing stock of the family if he was exceeded by his two younger brothers.Xiao Linfeng held his forehead and had a headache.Seeing the performance of Xiao Jinfeng, Xiao Linfeng knew that Xiao Jinfeng had ill feelings towards Xiao Qingyan. Xiao Linfeng originally expected that Xiao Jinfeng had a promise and could do a favor to Xiao Qingyan, but it seemed impossible as these two brothers had a tense relationship like that.\u201cJingting, you have Heaven Wealth and Land Treasure, and you should have given some items to your eldest brother!\u201d said Xiao Linfeng with some complaint.Xiao Qingyan was his most beloved son after all, so that Xiao Linfeng wanted to get some benefits for Xiao Qingyan.Xiao Jingting felt unhappy but he did not show anything on his face. He said with an embarrassed smile, \u201cFather, I was about to be arrested and sent to prison before I could pay the money. I was unable to care about my eldest brother for a while.\u201dWang Lu turned to Liu Xian as she heard what Xiao Jingting said. She threw her eyes on Liu Xian like the blade of a knife.Xiao Linfeng felt the tension between the three brothers, so that he said, \u201cForget it. Move out if you want to move out. I give you 10 mu of classy farmland, 20 mu of medium farmland, and 30 mu of inferior farmland to you.\u201dVisit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Xiao Jingting said excitedly, \u201cThank you very much, father.\u201d Xiao Linfeng was his father after all! He was much more generous than aunt. The location of the farmland Xiao Linfeng would give it to him should be not bad.\u201cYou should work hard. You have lots of debt,\u201d said Xiao Linfeng.Xiao Jingting nodded and said, \u201cI know.\u201d Xiao Jingting said to himself, \u2018What Xiao Linfeng implied is, he will not help me pay that ten thousand taels of silver for a month.\u2019Xiao Jinfeng stood up and said, \u201cFather, I want some farmland, too.\u201dWang Lu looked at Xiao Jinfeng and said, \u201cYou are not a spiritual planter. What do you want the farmland to do?\u201dXiao Qingyan immediately agreed, and said, \u201cYes, Second Brother! With the attribute you have, you will destroy the spiritual plants if you plant some on the farmland. And you will not earn any money, but will have to pay the money you spend instead. You cannot waste the farmland like this even though we have a lot of farmland.\u201d\u201cI am not a spiritual planter, but my wife Shuyu is! Shuyu is a level 5 Qi practitioner. We may earn some pocket money if we have some farmland to raise the child,\u201d said Xiao Jinfeng.Taking a look at Xiao Jinfeng, Wang Lu sighed and said, \u201cOK.\u201dXiao Qingyan looked awful when he heard that. He wanted to bring Xiao Jingting into trouble as he mentioned the spiritual pagoda in front of his parents, but unexpectedly, Xiao Jingting took the opportunity to get some more farmland from the parents.\u201cFather, mother, you must not play favorites! You can not only give farmland to two younger brothers!\u201d said Zheng Pei\u2019er.\u201cDo you want some farmland too, son?\u201d Xiao Linfeng turned to Xiao Qingyan and asked.Xiao Qingyan nodded, and said. \u201cYes.\u201dXiao Linfeng nodded, and said, \u201cWell, you have some too.\u201dXiao Jingting took a look at Xiao Qingyan, and said to himself, \u2018Students of Bifeng Academy should not leave the Academy for too long! Xiao Qingyan did not have time to look after the farmland even though he has it.\u2019Xiao Jingting felt sorry to Second Brother. When Second Brother asked for some farmland, Wang Lu asked him what he would do with the farmland because he was not a spiritual planter, but when Xiao Qingyan asked for some, his parents agreed immediately even though Xiao Qingyan could not have the time to take care of the farmland.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

And Xiao Muhong thought that the current biggest threat to him was not Xiao Qingyan, but Xiao Jingting.Liu Xian nodded, \u201cYeah! What\u00a0a\u00a0shame! If only we hadn\u2019t underestimated him and had kept close\u00a0watch\u00a0on him.\u201dThe guy Xiao Jingting was even willing to sell the Heaven Wealth and Land Treasure.

But after Xiao Jingting\u2019s coming back, he felt that she became\u00a0estranged\u00a0from him suddenly.\u2026\u2026Looking at the title deed for land and spiritual tower in front of him, Xiao Jingting said, \u201cThe parents are just too partial.\u201d Anyway, the original body owner was not the least favored in the family.Xu Muan nodded, \u201cYeah!\u201d Xiao Jingting had received 10 mu of high-quality farmland and 20 mu of medium-quality land and 30 mu of low-quality land, while Xiao Jinfeng had received only half of Xiao Jingting\u2019s and Xiao Qingyan had received double what Xiao Jingting had.Xiao Linfeng and Wang Lu were both master of spiritual plants, and if they had wholeheartedly\u00a0looked after the spiritual farmland, they could have had a good harvest every year. But given their levels of power, the resources they needed generally couldn\u2019t be gained by money.In this world, people had better physical\u00a0fitness than those on Earth since they could do self-cultivation, but they could live merely as long as those on Earth. Cultivators with level 9 of Qi Practice could only live around 100 years at most, but a foundation-stage cultivator may live to 200 years old.In order to live a longer life, no talented cultivator would be content with a plain\u00a0life, and certainly Xiao Linfeng and Wang Lu were no\u00a0exception. Much of\u00a0the\u00a0time, they just wandered around to seek opportunities to advance.Xiao Linfeng and Wang Lu\u2019s farmland were largely let\u00a0out. But given Xiao Linfeng and Wang Lu\u2019s ability, they could easily gain good harvest by using some magic technique to the farmland.\u201cFortunately, second brother doesn\u2019t mind that,\u201d said Xiao Jingting.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.But Xu Muan lowed his head and said in mind: It\u2019s hard to say whether he doesn\u2019t care that or he\u2019s frustrated about that.\u201cHow about Xiaofan?\u201d\u201cThe little Fire Cloud Bird has got hurt, Xiaofan is kind of sad for that and is accompanying it,\u201d said Xu Muan.Xiao Jingting shook his head and said, \u201cXiaofan and Yuerong can\u2019t get along by nature, things can go wrong if we just leave them together.\u201dXu Muan nodded, \u201cWhen we finally get the farmland, let\u2019s move out.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what\u00a0I\u00a0was\u00a0thinking. We need to start our work quickly; it\u2019s not a joke to pay a debt of ten to twenty thousand taels of silver a month.\u201d Leaving these two kids at Xiao family was just like leaving two time-bombs at home.Xiao Jingting\u00a0turned\u00a0the spiritual tower\u00a0over and\u00a0over in his hand, looked at Xu Muan and asked, \u201cMuan, in\u00a0your\u00a0judgment,\u00a0is it a right choice to buy this spiritual tower?\u201dXu Muan nodded, \u201cOf course it\u2019s.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d asked Xiao Jingting.\u201cIt can be used as being only for show! With an advanced artifact like this, it can have plenty of untapped functions, and it will not be that surprising for you to do better in farming than others later.\u201dLooking at Xu Muan, Xiao Jingting thought to himself: Xu Muan is really a clever one, then I must not expose the secret of his jade space. Xiao Jingting speculated that his being able to survive and incarnate on this body was mainly due to this jade. And the jade must have other functions he hadn\u2019t found.In fact, the spiritual spring in the jade space was the key to his doing well in spiritual plants growing, but he owed it to the spiritual tower.\u201cDear, you\u2019re so smart!\u201d said Xiao Jingting.Xu Muan smiled faintly, \u201cBy the way, I have got rid of most the books in your room. Some of them have actually no copies exited. At last I got 600 taels of silver from selling these books. Although it\u2019s less than ten thousand taels, it\u2019s better than nothing.\u201dXiao Jingting said, \u201cThat\u2019s very kind of you. Thanks for your hard work\u2026\u201d Xiao Jingting knew quite well that the books being got rid of by Xu Muan were all collections of erotica of the original body owner. Damn, erotica collections could be worth so much! And there were even only existing copies of them! What a dirty world!\u201cI have also picked out some useful books for you, you can check it out when you have time,\u201d said Xu Muan.Xiao Jingting nodded, \u201cOkay.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You\u2019ve said you would punish that brat, but finally nothing has happened to him.\u201d Xiao Yuerong rolled on the ground angrily.Looking at Xiao Yuerong who was crying importunately, Zheng Pei\u2019er felt gloomy in soul. Recalling Xiao Jingting had abused her without mercy, Zheng Pei\u2019er just felt angry. And Xiao Qingyan was wholly concerned with the Heaven Wealth and Land Treasure, and didn\u2019t stick up for her when she was humiliated.\u201cMom, could you buy me a Fire Cloud Bird? Even the little fool has one, and it looks quite majestic when he rides on it. How could I be inferior to him!\u201d Xiao Yuerong got up and said.Zheng Pei\u2019er nodded, \u201cOK, I promise you.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t understand why third uncle likes that little fool. Mom, you know what? That little fool likes eating garlic and stinky tofu, which makes him smell stinky. He just bit me with that stinky body!\u201d Xiao Yuerong rubbed his fat arms disgustedly.Zheng Pei\u2019er squinted and thought, Xiao Jingting was quite strange, he had never taken that little fool seriously at all before! But now he just safeguarded him like protecting a treasure. Though Xiao Xiaofan was not worth mentioning, Xiao Xiaodong seemed to be precocious and had advanced to level two of Qi Practice earlier than her eldest son Xiao Yuefeng. He could be a threat to her son in the future!After getting Xiao Yuerong settled, Zheng Pei\u2019er walked into the room and stared at Xiao Qingyan.Xiao Qingyan was drinking in depressed mood. \u201cAre you OK? You look so pale. Father and Mother are still partial to you most, anyway. They\u2019ve given you much more farmland than all those being given to your second brother and third brother.\u201d\u201cThey did give me much, but they also gave a lot to second brother!\u201dBefore, the pocket money given to second brother by his father could only match up to a fraction of that given to him. Leaving Xiao Jingting aside, Xiao Jinfeng was given much farmland, too. Comparing with his, Xiao Jinfeng\u2019s farmland seemed not that much, but who did he think he was, how dare Xiao Jinfeng go against him all around? Xiao Qingyan felt quite wretched to think of missing an advanced spiritual plant which may gave him a leap in practice.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Wang Lu was at the dressing table and sighed.Looking at Wang Lu, Xiao Linfeng asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s up? Are you in a bad mood?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t expect our second and third sons to advance to level five,\u201d said Wang Lu.Looking at Wang Lu, Xiao Linfeng smiled, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with our sons being all promising? Do you wish our sons to be worthless?\u201dWang Lu gave him a wry smile, \u201cI certainly wish our sons all to be promising. However, they three don\u2019t band together to defend against enemies, but just hate each other instead, and they may fight inside.\u201dListening this, Xiao Linfeng sighed, \u201cBefore, the second used to get on well with the first, but couldn\u2019t get along with the third. However, after our coming back this time, the second have good relationships with the third, but with the first, they\u2026\u201dWang Lu lowed her head. After came back, she had thoroughly investigated what had happened in this family.\u201cWhen the second was wronged and expelled from the mercenary team, the first didn\u2019t take his side. The second might bear grudge against the first due to that,\u201d said Wang Lu.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Xiao Linfeng sighed helplessly, \u201cThere\u2019s something wrong with the first\u2019s action, thus the second bore grudge against him. Leaving aside other things, he didn\u2019t share the Heaven Wealth and Land Treasure with his own brother but actually sold it instead.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s done is done, I don\u2019t think we can get it back. He\u2019s in a bad situation at that time, anyway. He might offend the Hou family if he didn\u2019t sell it. It\u2019s all Liu Xian\u2019s fault. She was so obsequious in front of me, but once something was happened to me, she just showed her true color immediately. Look at the farmland she had given to our third son, it\u2019s remote as well as dangerous, and there\u2019re monsters haunting. The third might have lost his life but for his good luck.\u201d Wang Lu said by gnashing her teeth.Xiao Linfeng;s face darkened. Though he didn\u2019t get on very well with his big brother Xiao Chengfeng, they always seemed doing okay. But this time, after knowing what Xiao Chengfeng had done when he was in distress, he felt disappointed in Xiao Chengfeng.\u201cThe third was driven out of the family without getting anything, the second fell into disrepute and was driven out of the family, too, for all this your good big brother and good sister-in-law should take the blame, and I think it should include our first son\u2019s being excluded in the Academy as well.\u201dXiao Linfeng nodded, \u201cIndeed, big brother and sister-in-law have gone too far.\u201d\u2026\u2026Xiao Xiaofan was rolling around in the bed excitedly. Seeing that, Xiao Xiaodong curled his lips and asked, \u201cWhat makes you so happy?\u201d\u201cBrother, we will move out very soon.\u201d Xiao Xiaofan replied excitedly.Xiao Xiaodong nodded, \u201cYeah.\u201d After moving out, Xiao Xiaofan would not have to eat a lot of garlic every day due to feeling insecure.Xiao Xiaodong scratched his head in anguish and thought, why there\u2019s only one bed in the room and he had to sleep with Xiao Xiaofan? Just look at what Xiaofan usually did to him, robbing his quilt, stretching out the stinky feet to his mouth, grinding the teeth to annoy him when asleep, and liking eating stinky food to stink up the whole quilt\u2026he\u2019s just too annoying.\u201cBrother, don\u2019t you sleep on the same end of the bed as I do?\u201d asked Xiao Xiaofan.Xiao Xiaodong shook his head, \u201cNo, I sleep on the other end.\u201dXiao Xiaofan didn\u2019t impose him, but fell asleep and snored soon.Xiao Xiaodong irritably moved away Xiao Xiaofan\u2019s stinky foot which had stretched to his face and thought: How carefree this guy is, just fall asleep so soon.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Actually, I don\u2019t think eldest brother has tried cultivating farmland,\u201d said Xiao Jinfeng.Mu Shuyu stared at Xiao Jinfeng surprisedly, \u201cWith a cultivation of level five in Qi Practice, your eldest brother actually hasn\u2019t tried cultivating farmland yet?\u201dXiao Jinfeng nodded, \u201cYes!\u201dMu Shuyu was stunned at once, and Xiao Jinfeng went on enviously, \u201cSince my eldest brother used to live a carefree life, he didn\u2019t need to cultivate land. Our parents always think that, eldest brother needs to be more powerful before he begins to devote himself into farmland cultivation.\u201d\u201cReally? Stop talking about him,\u201d said Mu Shuyu. Recalling that Xiao Qingyan was so furious that day when the thing about the Heaven Wealth and Land Treasure was mentioned, Mu Shuyu just felt amused and vexed.Xiao Jinfeng probably was in an irritable mood; he took out a jar of wine and started drinking. \u201cThird brother is generous enough, since he has given me so much spiritual wine. But recently, it\u2019s just consumed without replenishment and getting less and less every day, so disturbing it is.\u201dLooking at Xiao Jinfeng\u2019s appearance of pity, Mu Shuyu said helplessly, \u201cYou\u2019d better drink less every day.\u201dXiao Linfeng smiled embarrassedly, \u201cI\u2019d love to, but I can\u2019t help it.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s you!\u201d Mu Shuyu said jokingly and shook his head.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026In the morning.Xiao Xiaodong was holding Xiao Xiaofan\u2019s hand and they were walking together towards Xiao Chengfeng\u2019s secondary house.Xiao Xiaofan\u2019s face reddened\u00a0with excitement, and he was\u00a0bouncing\u00a0when\u00a0walking, \u201cBrother, I will do it later.\u201d\u201cGood. It\u2019s up to you. If she will refuse you when you ask our eldest aunt for money later, you can just act up and roll over, hug her leg and give her a bite\u2026\u201d Xiao Xiaodong suggested.Xiao Xiaofan winked\u00a0his eyes and asked in confusion, \u201cIf I act up and roll over, hug her leg and give her a bite, then what will you do?\u201dXiao Xiaodong cleared his throat and replied, \u201cI will stand\u00a0aside\u00a0and cheer\u00a0for\u00a0you\u201d.Hearing that, Xiao Xiaofan didn\u2019t understand and nodded, \u201cAlright.\u201dSeeing Xiao Xiaofan agreed so readily, Xiao Xiaodong felt kind of guilty.After Liu Xian promised to pay the money, Xiao Jingting just couldn\u2019t forget that two thousand taels of silver. He wasn\u2019t afraid that Liu Xian would be bilking; he just worried that a long delay would cause trouble, and only actually obtaining the money would reassure\u00a0him.Generally, the debtor was more like the boss. And in his previous life, Xiao Jingting had lent money to others and had learned\u00a0the difficulty of\u00a0dunning debts, of which only himself could feel\u00a0the\u00a0pain.Considering it\u2019s disgraceful\u00a0to ask the money himself, Xiao Jingting\u00a0thought of his two kids in a curious coincidence, and he just entrusted\u00a0this glorious\u00a0yet\u00a0difficult\u00a0task to the two kids.Since Xiao Xiaofan had hardly ever been assigned duties by his father, he felt very excited when he got this task, so he beat his chest and promised he would\u00a0fulfil\u00a0the\u00a0task, which made Xiao Jingting, who was using\u00a0child labor, be quite shamed.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201cHere\u00a0we\u00a0are.\u201d Xiao Xiaodong took Xiao Xiaofan to the gate of Xiao Chengfeng\u2019s secondary house.Xiao Xiaofan nodded, and said happily, \u201cLet me knock.\u201dAfter a while, a guard came to open the door, and seeing the visitors were two children, the guard gave them a smile.\u201cChilde Xiaodong, Childe Xiaofan, what are you doing here?\u201dBefore, Xiao Xiaodong and Xiao Xiaofan had very low status in the Xiao family, and if this happened one year ago, the guard might have driven them away. But now, the guard had to force a smile to them pleasantly.\u201cWe are here for the money.\u201d Xiao Xiaofan came\u00a0straight\u00a0to the point with his hands on the hip.\u201cTwo thousand taels of silver,\u201d Xiao Xiaodong added.Hearing the noise, Liu Xian came out of the door. When Xiao Xiaofan saw Liu Xian being out, he immediately rushed at her, just like a cat smelling fishiness; and he hugged\u00a0her leg and shouted, \u201cGranny, granny, two thousand taels of silver, two thousand taels of silver, I\u2019m here for the money.\u201dLiu Xian hadn\u2019t known the situation at the beginning, but after hearing what Xiao Xiaofan said, she understood at once, and quietly cursed\u00a0Xiao Jingting for being so blasted\u00a0and sending his two kids to dun debts early\u00a0this morning.Xiao Xiaofan was vigorously hugging and rubbing her leg, which made Liu Xian get angry.\u201cHere it is\u2026two thousand taels.\u201d Liu Xian impatiently gave the bank notes to Xiao Xiaofan.Xiao Xiaofan accepted the bank notes and right away and gave them to Xiao Xiaodong happily, \u201cBrother, check it and see if we\u2019re fully\u00a0paid.\u201dLiu Xian looked at Xiao Xiaofan\u2019s miser-like expression with contempt.Xiao Xiaodong counted\u00a0the bank notes over and over again and then affirmed, \u201cWe\u2019re fully\u00a0paid; it\u2019s exactly\u00a0two thousand taels here.\u201dLiu Xian sneered and said to herself: fools! How could I pay you less? Xiao Jingting was just a bastard, the fine was only fifteen hundred taels, but he had dunned me for two thousand taels, he\u00a0was thick-skinned enough.After hearing Xiao Xiaodong\u2019s words, Xiao Xiaofan once again rushed at Liu Xian and hugged her leg, \u201cGranny, granny, red envelope, give me red envelope.\u201dLiu Xian gnashed her teeth and thought, haven\u2019t they got enough with five hundred taels more of fine? They should dare to ask for red envelope.Seeing Liu Xian\u2019s terrible look, Xiao Xiaofan lay down and rolled over on the ground straightway, and a cry rose from his throat, \u201cGive me red envelope, give me red envelope\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Holding\u00a0a\u00a0large amount of money, Xiao Xiaodong felt anxious, even he\u2019s in the Xiao family now. Therefore, he unconsciously\u00a0quickened his\u00a0pace.Xiao Xiaofan was tightly\u00a0holding his red envelope and trotting behind Xiao Xiaodong.\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Xiao Xiaodong and Xiao Xiaofan were stopped by someone at\u00a0the door of\u00a0their\u00a0house.Seeing they were Chen Xijin and Chen Yueling, Xiao Xiaofan pouted unconsciously.Chen Xijin and Chen Yueling were the children of Xiao Yi, a distant\u00a0cousin of Xiao Jingting. The original Xiao Jingting had some affection towards this distant\u00a0cousin, and Xiao Yi sometimes came to stay in the Xiao family.\u00a0Xiao Jingting\u00a0then extended his love\u00a0to\u00a0Xiao Yi\u2019s two children and particularly\u00a0loved them, and those who didn\u2019t know the truth might identity Xiao Yi\u2019s children with Xiao Jingting\u2019s own children.Though Xiao Xiaodong was precocious, he also had a hunger for father\u2019s love after all, and seeing that Chen Xijin and Chen Yueling obviously\u00a0had\u00a0nothing\u00a0to do\u00a0with Xiao Jingting but could get Xiao Jingting\u2019s favor, while he and his little brother were undoubtedly Xiao Jingting\u2019s real sons but receive no care from Xiao Jingting, he was very jealous.Though Xiao Xiaodong was very young, he had a\u00a0very\u00a0reserved manner, even though he was dissatisfied with something, he never showed it on his face. But\u00a0it\u2019s\u00a0different\u00a0in\u00a0Xiao Xiaofan. Chen Xijin had once showed off\u00a0the gift Xiao Jingting bought to him to Xiao Xiaofan, Xiao Xiaofan felt aggrieved at that\u00a0and pounced\u00a0on Chen Xijin to grab the gift. As a result, Xiao Xiaofan succeeded in grabbing it unexpectedly.But Xiao Xiaofan wasn\u2019t pleased\u00a0for too long. Chen Xijin split on\u00a0him to Xiao Jingting, and Xiao Jingting punished him violently, and even Xu Muan was punished along with him. Since then, Xiao Xiaofan had\u00a0nightmares\u00a0about\u00a0Xiao Jingting, and he just hid when he saw Xiao Jingting, which lasted for half a month. However, Xiao Xiaofan had a poor memory and just forgot all about this very soon.Chen Xijin stared at Xiao Xiaofan and Xiao Xiaodong in confusion. Before they came, Xiao Yi had told Chen Xijin and Chen Yueling that Xiao Jingting had become different since his coming back this time, so had Xiao Xiaofan and Xiao Xiaodong. But Chen Xijin thought that what his mother said was exaggerated, and wondered how different could Xiao Xiaofan and Xiao Xiaodong these two little poor beggars be.When Chen Xijin met the two brothers, he felt that his mother was right. Chen Xijin looked at Xiao Xiaofan\u2019s clothes, and found that it was really gorgeous and nice.Children always like glamorous\u00a0things. Xiao Xiaofan\u2019s clothes had good-quality texture, and they were also embroidered with colorful designs, which made it look very festive.With recalling that his father had recently spent all the money on the elixirs for breakthrough in practice, and then suffered a failure at the breakthrough, thus made the whole family suffer economic\u00a0troubles, Chen Xijin felt quite jealous\u00a0at once.The sharp-eyed Chen Yueling caught a glimpse of the red envelope in Xiao Xiaofan\u2019s hand and said, \u201cWhat are you holding? Just show me.\u201dXiao Xiaofan pulled his hand back and raised his\u00a0head, \u201cI won\u2019t give it to you.\u201d\u201cUncle Jingting will come to punish you later if you act like this,\u201d Chen Yueling said proudly.Xiao Xiaofan snorted and said, \u201cMy father no longer loves you now, but loves Xiaofan most. Xiaofan have helped father finish a great task just now, so he will never punish me.\u201d\u201cLittle fool, you\u2019re just daydreaming.\u201d Chen Yueling was looking at the red envelope in Xiao Xiaofan\u2019s hand jealously, and then pounced on him to grab it.For some time, Xiao Xiaofan had taken the food made by the spiritual spring. Though he had got little increase in his spiritual energy, he had obtained a brute\u00a0force. So, he easily\u00a0flung\u00a0Chen Yueling\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0ground.Seeing this, Chen Xijin shouted, \u201cLittle fool, how dare you push\u00a0my sister?\u201dXiao Xiaofan said in panic, \u201cI wasn\u2019t pushing her hard! She did it herself. It\u2019s none of my business.\u201dVisit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Chen Xijin\u2019s shouts\u00a0drew Xiao Jingting\u00a0out.\u201cUncle Jingting, he bullied us.\u201d Chen Xijin pointed to Xiao Xiaofan and said.\u201cNonsense, since Xiaofan is weak and sickly, he can only be bullied by others; he never bullies anyone,\u201d said Xiao Jingting.Xu Muan lowed his head, smiled quietly and thought, before, Xiaofan had been indeed weak and sickly, but since Xiao Jingting became a different one as the present him, Xiaofan was well\u00a0fed and getting better in his physical fitness.Xiao Yi\u2019s face suddenly changed. Xiao Jingting rubbed his forehead. He would have forgot this woman if she hadn\u2019t visited. Sometimes, he dared not recall all those things done by the original body owner. But, as those people who known by the original body owner appeared one by one, he had to recall all those things.Xiao Jingting couldn\u2019t understand how\u00a0the\u00a0mind\u00a0of the original body owner worked, given that he didn\u2019t love his own children but loved the children of others very much.This time, Xiao Yi was coming to complain\u00a0of being hard up. Xiao Jingting was just tired\u00a0of such things, and told Xiao Yi that he\u2019s\u00a0up\u00a0to his ass\u00a0in\u00a0debt now, and if he couldn\u2019t pay it next month, he would be done for, therefore no\u00a0one\u00a0could help her but\u00a0herself.Xiao Yi cried for a long time, and seeing Xiao Jingting unmoved, she was immediately disappointed.\u201cJingting, my son won\u2019t lie to you,\u201d said Xiao Yi.Xiao Jingting said stonily, \u201cCousin, my sons are also very reasonable and obedient, they won\u2019t make trouble for no\u00a0reason.\u201dXiao Yi smiled reluctantly, and picked up Chen Yueling from the ground. Hearing what Xiao Jingting said, Chen Yueling was kind of angry, \u201cUncle, you are guarding a little fool and don\u2019t help me. I hate you.\u201dXiao Jingting smiled, \u201cGo home and act girly to your daddy.\u201d What a foolish girl, dared to threaten him. The original body owner had favored her, taken her seriously, and coaxed\u00a0her once she acted girly and cutesy, but he was not as foolish as the original body owner.\u201cYueling, don\u2019t talk nonsense.\u201d Xiao Yi reprimanded her, but glanced at Xiao Jingting with grievance in eyes at the same time.Seeing Xiao Yi didn\u2019t help her, Chen Yueling snorted with anger.Xiao Yi smiled at Xiao Jingting awkwardly and said, \u201cSorry, she\u2019s childish.\u201dXiao Jingting smiled, \u201cIt\u2019s OK. My Xiaofan and Xiaodong are very reasonable, and I have nothing to worry about them.\u201d Xiao Jingitng reached out his\u00a0hand\u00a0and rubbed Xiao Xiaofan\u2019s hairy head.Hearing this, Xiao Yi\u2019s face distorted.Chen Yueling stared at Xiao Jingting with widened and hurtful\u00a0eyes.Xiao Jingting avoided the little girl\u2019s hurtful\u00a0eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Xiao Jingting felt a headache when he thought of the fierce and vicious look of the little girl before she left. He remembered an old saying, \u2018only a proper favor can make a man grateful\u2019. As the original body owner spoiled the two naughty children, they held a grudge on him now! But he didn\u2019t care about these two kids who hadn\u2019t even grown up.\u201cHave you got the money?\u201d Xiao Jingting asked Xiao Xiaofan.Xiao Xiaofan patted himself on the chest and pretended to be experienced. \u201cFather, with me doing the work, are you still worried?\u201d asked he.Xiao Jingting nodded with a smile, \u201cAbsolutely not. You are so capable. Of course I believe you.\u201d\u201cThe silver is in my brother\u2019s hand. My brother told me the number was right. If he counted the wrong number as he is not good at arithmetic, it will be none of my business,\u201d said Xiao Xiaofan.Xiao Xiaodong glared at Xiao Xiaofan sideways, and said, \u201cDo you think I\u2019m as stupid as you are?\u201dXiao Xiaofan flicked a disgruntled glance at Xiao Xiaodong. Holding Xiao Jingting\u2019s thigh, he rubbed it and said with some grievance, \u201cFather, my brother is really not good! He always says I am stupid, but I am very capable, sometimes!\u201d\u201cRight. Xiaofan is very capable most times.\u201dWith some complacency, Xiao Xiaofan raised her chin toward Xiao Xiaodong as she heard what Xiao Jingting said.Xiao Xiaodong walked on air to take out the silver note. He passed it over to Xiao Jingting and said, \u201cHere it is, a total of two thousand taels of silver.\u201dXiao Jingting took the silver note and threw it into the storage bag. \u201cXiaodong has counted the number,\u201d he said, \u201cand it can\u2019t be wrong.\u201dXiao Xiaofan argued, \u201cFather, I acted up like crazy and grabbed her skirt. Otherwise, it would not have been so easy to get the silver note.\u201dXiao Jingting, \u201c\u2026\u201d \u2018Acted up like crazy and grabbed her skirt\u2019?Without noticing the look of Xiao Jingting, Xiao Xiaofan continued as he waved his hands like dancing, \u201cFather, I also got two red envelopes, including one for my brother. My brother is so stupid! He couldn\u2019t say a word when he met that girl. I\u2019m so smart.\u201dXiao Xiaodong, \u201c\u2026\u201dXiao Xiaofan said to Xiao Jingting in a mysterious way, \u201cThat girl was to rob my red envelope just now. I gently pushed her, and she fell on the ground at once. She must be anaemic as she is really too weak!\u201dXiao Jingting, \u201c\u2026\u201d He accidentally mentioned anemia, and Xiao Xiaofan remembered the word right off.Xiao Xiaofan bashfully took out a red envelope and handed it to Xiao Jingting. \u201cFather, this is the red envelope.\u201d\u201cHow much silver?\u201d asked Xiao Jingting.\u201cTwenty taels of silver,\u201d replied Xiao Xiaofan.Xiao Jingting touched his chin and said, \u201cTwenty taels of silver, that\u2019s not too much! Keep it for yourself.\u201d Xiao Xiaofan quickly took his hand back immediately.Xiao Jingting felt funny because Xiao Xiaofan looked like a money-grubber.Xu Muan walked out and said, \u201cYou two haven\u2019t had breakfast yet, have you?\u201dXiao Xiaofan nodded and said, \u201cYes, I haven\u2019t had it yet.\u201dXiao Jingting was in a daze for a moment. His son was positive to collect the debt without having breakfast. As the father, Xiao Jingting felt embarrassed!Xu Muan looked at Xiao Xiaofan and said, \u201cXiaofan has performed very well today. You can eat more.\u201dVisit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Xiao Xiaofan said in a delighted way, \u201cSure, I\u2019m going to eat much.\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Xiao Yi took the children to the guest room of Xiao\u2019s family.\u201cHave you borrowed any money, mother?\u201d asked Chen Xijin eagerly. Borrowing money, in fact, was to ask Xiao Jingting for some silver. Xiao Yi had borrowed some money from Xiao Jingting several times before. She did not borrow much money every time, and Xiao Jingting agreed readily.Xiao Yi shook her head and said, \u201cNo.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve heard from my uncle that Xiao Jingting spent hundreds of thousands of taels of silver to buy a spiritual pagoda. He is a rich man now,\u201d said Chen Xijin in a jealous way.Xiao Yi squinted her eyes. Xiao Jingting was really rich, but he was stingier than before.Chen Yueling was still immersed in hating Xiao Jingting since she had been slighted by him, and she said with a hateful voice, \u201cUncle Xiao doesn\u2019t want to help me, so I will turn my back on him.\u201dXiao Yi felt helpless as she looked at Chen Yueling. Xiao Jingting was much different from before. Xiao Jingting would have coaxed her patiently if Chen Yueling behaved in a naughty way in front of Xiao Jingting like before. But it was not like before. It was said that Xiao Jingting doted on the little fool very much, for whom, Xiao Jingting confronted him firmly.\u201cYou want to turn your back on him, but he is now happy to ignore you,\u201d said Chen Xijin.Chen Yueling blushed and said depressingly, \u201cUncle Xiao goes back on his word. He said clearly that he loved me the most as the most precious one.\u201dXiao Yi lowered her head. Before she came, she had heard that Xiao Jingting changed a lot, and Sun Miaomiao had not asked anything from him. So, she had been prepared for the result.Although she was prepared, Xiao Yi felt uncomfortable and unhappy. Xiao Yi had expected she was an exception for Xiao Jingting, but\u2026\u201cMother, I\u2019ve heard that Uncle Xiao is now a level 5 Qi practitioner. Is it fake news?\u201d asked Chen Yueling. Her father was a very strong man in Chen Yueling\u2019s mind. Her father had failed to be promoted to be a level 4 Qi practitioner. Uncle Xiao could get a chance to be a level 5 Qi practitioner as an unambitious person, which was unbelievable!Chen Yueling said, \u201cYour uncle Xiao is blessed. He has been a level 5 Qi practitioner because he ate some Heaven Wealth and Land Treasure.\u201dChen Yueling was more unhappy as she heard that.\u201cYoung lady, Xiao Yi came out from Xiao Jingting\u2019s home and it seems that she did not get anything,\u201d A maid said to Sun Miaomiao.Sun Miaomiao nodded and said, \u201cNot a surprise. Xiao Jingting is different from before.\u201d Xiao Jingting had respected her as if he was her filial grandson at that time, but he turned his back on her now. To say nothing of Xiao Yi.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Xu Muan asked Xiao Jingting who was as busy as a bee, \u201cAre we leaving today?\u201dXiao Jingting nodded and said, \u201cYes! The sooner, the better. Our son is more troublesome than any other boy.\u201dAs long as he was not watching, Xiao Xiaofan could fight with the others. Although Xiaofan was innocent, it would not be allowed if he always fought like this. He could protect his son once or twice, but he would be helpless if his son kept fighting.Xu Muan nodded and said, \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d It was clear that Xiao Linfeng and Wang Lu were very impatient to their younger son. Xiao Linfeng and Wang Lu had played favorites for a long time, which was not easily changed.\u201cHurry up. We\u2019re leaving,\u201d said Xiao Xiaodong.Xiao Xiaofan was rolling on the bed excitedly. \u201cIt\u2019s cool. We won\u2019t stay in this lame place anymore.\u201d he said.Xiao Xiaodong looked at joyful Xiao Xiaofan, and said in an ironic way, \u201cYes, it\u2019s cool! Otherwise, you\u2019ll be beaten all day in this place.\u201dXiao Xiaofan turned himself over depressingly, raised his fists and said, \u201cThat bastard Xiao Yuerong! I must beat him as I grow up.\u201dXiao Xiaofan smiled coldly, and said, \u201cYou can beat him if you are strong, otherwise he can beat you if you\u2019re not.\u201dXiao Xiaofan looked at his brother with depression, and said, \u201cBrother, you\u2019re really bothersome. You always leave me frustrated.\u201dXu Muan came in and said, \u201cHurry up to tidy up. We are leaving very soon. Everything will be left behind if you have no time to pack them up.\u201dXiao Xiaofan jumped up from the bed, \u201cWait for me, wait for me! I have too many toys and I can\u2019t leave them behind.\u201dXiao Xiaodong snorted and said with disdain, \u201cA little kid is a little kid, who only cares about playing with toys.\u201dXiao Xiaofan took a look at Xiao Xiaodong. He curled his lips and said, \u201cBrother, I saw you secretly playing with my toys.\u201dXiao Xiaodong\u2019s face turned red slightly. He said unhappily, \u201cYou\u2019re wrong.\u201dXiao Xiaofan frowned and argued, \u201cAm I wrong? My little toy duck was broken, but I didn\u2019t play with it very much. It must be you who broke it.\u201dXiao Xiaodong\u2019s face turned rose red and he said, \u201cIt\u2019s you who do not take care of it. I have nothing to do with your broken toy.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s you who broke it,\u201d said Xiao Xiaofan in a gloomy way.\u201cYou broke it and forgot it,\u201d said Xiao Xiaodong.Looking at Xiao Xiaodong as an unredeemable boy, Xiao Xiaofan said, \u201cMy memory is not so bad. Don\u2019t humiliate me as you think I am stupid.\u201dXiao Xiaodong hit back, \u201cYour memory has always been very bad.\u201dXu Muan looked at the two little ones helplessly and said, \u201cStop it, don\u2019t say a word any more. You will have to leave your things behind later if you have no time to tidy them up. We\u2019re leaving here soon.\u201dXiao Xiaofan was frightened and said, \u201cSlow down please!\u201dXiao Xiaofan turned to Xiao Xiaodong and said, \u201cBrother, I don\u2019t haggle over the toys with you, but you must help me tidy up the toys.\u201d\u201cI never played with your toys, but since you are so pitiful, I will help you tidy them up,\u201d said Xiao Xiaodong with complacency.Xiao Xiaofan nodded and said in a helpless way, \u201cAll right, all right, you have won. Please help me move the toys to the chart.\u201dOutside the door did Xiao Jingting look at his two sons coming in and out as busy as two little bees. He said to himself, \u2018I don\u2019t know Xiaofan has had so many toys already. A kid is a kid, who cares noting but the toys when making a move. Xiaodong really has brotherly love! He is usually tough to Xiaofan, but he has brotherly love at a critical moment\u2019.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201cAre they really leaving?\u201d Xiao Qingyan asked Zheng Pei\u2019er.Zheng pei\u2019er nodded and said, \u201cYes!\u201d\u201cIn such a hurry,\u201d said Xiao Qingyan with some suspicion. He had thought that Xiao Jingting would stay with his parents for a while to please them.Recently, a lot of people had come to visit his parents, praising Xiao Jingting as a prodigal son, with fewer people praising himself. He has been a level 5 Qi\u00a0practitioner for a long time, which was not a fresh news any more.It seemed that his parents had a better attitude toward Xiao Jingting after they received many compliments for their son.Xiao Qingyan squinted his eyes, deep in thought. He had been a level 5 Qi practitioner for too long. It was likely that he would not keep his status if he could not make a breakthrough to the next level, although a lot of people were likely to be a level 5 Qi practitioner for a long time.\u201cPerhaps they want to make concessions in order to gain advantages,\u201d said Zheng Pei\u2019er in a gloomy voice. Father and mother would feel more ashamed and uneasy for Xiao Jingting if he left the family.\u201cTen thousand taels of silver for one month. Xiao Jingting is a real madman. I don\u2019t believe that he can pay back the money from farming. When the time comes that he has no money to pay, I\u2019m afraid he will have to cry for help from my parents,\u201d said Xiao Qingyan in an ironic way.\u201cExactly,\u201d Zheng Pei\u2019er said, \u201chis down payment must be earned from selling Heaven Wealth and Land Treasure.\u201d She did not know how precious the spiritual plants were, which must be extraordinary, worth so much silver.\u201cA heartless man.\u201d Xiao Qingyan felt heartache as he heard Heaven Wealth and Land Treasure as mentioned by Zheng Pei\u2019er.\u201cQingyan, is it the time for you to go back to the academy?\u201d asked Zheng Pei\u2019er.Xiao Qingyan nodded, and said, \u201cYes.\u201d He had been away from the academy for some long time. It would have adverse impact on him if he was away for too long, although a student was allowed to be away from the academy for some time. He had been away for so long that he could hardly stay at home any more.\u201cI have to ask the parents for some more silver, because it will be necessary when I am at the academy,\u201d said Xiao Qingyan.Xiao Qingyan said to himself, \u2018I suffered a lot for being penniless when the parents suddenly disappeared. The guys at the academy are all snobs. I will lose my status at once if I do not have money.\u2019\u201cWe will be able to earn some money every month if the farmland is rent to others given by your parents,\u201d said Zheng Pei\u2019er.Xiao Qingyan shot a cold glance at Zheng Pei\u2019er and said, \u201cYou can make a decision for yourself. But, you must report the accounts to me every month.\u201dWhen his parents disappeared, Zheng Pei\u2019er tried to make a divorce with Xiao Qingyan, so Xiao Qingyan was estranged from Zheng Pei\u2019er. But after all, she gave birth to two sons for him, he still had more or less some love with her. Xiao Qingyan had no other appropriate person to entrust, so he could only entrust Zheng Pei\u2019er.Zheng Pei\u2019er nodded and said, \u201cYou have my word.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Shortly after they left, Xiao Jinfeng and Mu Shuyu quietly left too.These two brothers went out of the city one after the other. With so much debt, Xiao Jingting did not waste any time to inspect his farmland as soon as he got there. Mu Shuyu was envious of Xiao Jingting that he had some farmland while they were in Mound Village. She also could not wait to go to see their farmland with Xiao Jinfeng as they had some now.There were some spiritual plants on the farmland given by Xiao Linfeng and Wang Lu, which belonged to Xiao Jingting and Xiao Jingfeng now.Xiao Jingting took a look at his farmland, finding that its quality was good and its geographical location was not bad. He believed that the monster beasts were not likely to haunt here as much as in Mound Village.After inspection of his own farmland, Xiao Jingting went to see Xiao Jinfeng\u2019s. The quality of a few pieces of superior and medium farmland of Xiao Jinfeng looked also good. The spiritual plants on the superior farmland had just been harvested, and the plants on the medium farmland had begun to grow, but the inferior farmland was not good.\u201cHow come it\u2019s sand land?\u201d Mu Shuyu frowned as she looked at the farmland in front of her. There were little pieces of spiritual plants, which looked shriveled.It was notoriously difficult to grow spiritual plants on the sand land. The spiritual plants would often die on the sand land. Much sand land was left idle. You would often lose money if you planted some spirit plants on the sand land.Xiao Jinfeng felt unhappy and depressed. Without saying a word, Xiao Jinfeng was uncomfortable because as a son of their parents, he had been given the least of the land. Besides, he found 15 mu of inferior farmland was sand land, so Xiao Jinfeng felt more uncomfortable.Mu Shuyu looked at Xiao Jinfeng and patted him on the shoulder, \u201cTake it easy, it\u2019s better than nothing.\u201dXiao Jinfeng nodded, and said, \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d\u201cSecond Brother, exchange this 15 mu of land with me,\u201d said Xiao Jingting who was looking at the sand land in front of him.Xiao Jinfeng was dumbfounded. He asked surprisingly, \u201cExchange with you?\u201dXiao Jingting nodded and said, \u201cYes, exchange it with me.\u201d\u201cJingting, I know you are doing this for our own good, but your Second Brother and I cannot take advantage of you,\u201d said Mu Shuyu.\u201cShuyu, you misunderstand me, I want this sand land because it is useful. It is the best for growing watermelons,\u201d said Xiao Jingting.There were some watermelon seedlings in Xiao Jingting\u2019s jade space, which were brought over from his previous life. After knowing that there were also watermelons in this world, Xiao Jingting pretended that his watermelon seedlings had been found in the mountain forest. He had planted some in Mound Village. The watermelons tasted sweet and became well received.The first batch of watermelons had been eaten by themselves, because there were not many of them. Xiao Jingting had planned to expand the planting areas, and sell some if he had more watermelons. But, before Xiao Jingting began to expand the planting areas, the person sent by Father Xiao and Mother Xiao came over to take them home.Mu Shuyu paused for a moment and said, \u201cDoes the book say the sand land is the best for watermelons?\u201dXiao Jingting nodded and said, \u201cYes! Watermelons are something good, and I really want to plant much more of them. This sand land just comes right in time.\u201d\u201cBrother, you\u2019ve helped me so much, and I give this ten mu of sand land to you,\u201d said Xiao Jinfeng after he thought for a while.Xiao Jingting said with a helpless smile, \u201cSecond Brother, how can I take advantage of you if you don\u2019t want to take advantage of me? I can\u2019t take care of so much farmland by myself.\u201dXiao Jinfeng smiled and said, \u201cOk, I\u2019ll exchange the fifteen mu of sand land for only ten mu of your farmland.\u201dXiao Jingting looked at Xiao Jinfeng\u2019s face, nodded and said, \u201cSure.\u201dXiao Jingting and Xiao Jinfeng went to see the farmland given by their parents to Xiao Qingyan. Unsurprisingly, the farmland given by their parents to Xiao Qingyan was indeed the best among three brothers.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026After inspecting the farmland, they returned to their temporary residences by the field.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.There were several good temporary residences by the field owned by Father Xiao and Mother Xiao, one for each of the three brothers.\u201cOur parents are really unreasonable. The farmland given to Second Brother is sand land, but fortunately, I just need sand land,\u201d said Xiao Jingting.\u201cBefore they gave us the land deeds, they were likely to have discussed with our eldest brother and sister-in-law,\u201d said Xu Muan in a gentle voice.Xiao Jingting felt a headache, \u201cIf so, it\u2019s reasonable.\u201d\u201cBy the way, is sand land really suitable for watermelons?\u201d asked Xu Muan.Xiao Jingting nodded and said, \u201cYes! Sand land has good air permeability and poor water capacity, so that the watermelons will have vigorous root metabolism and high sugar content\u2026\u201dAlthough Xu Muan did not understand what Xiao Jingting said, he nodded his head admiringly as Xiao Jingting made it clear and logical.\u201cI also want to plant some fruits. It is going to be hot soon, so I want to make some cold spiritual fruit smoothie, which will be very popular,\u201d said Xiao Jingting.Xu Muan thought about it and said, \u201cTry to use the local spiritual fruits. You may arouse suspicion if you use too many other spiritual fruits.\u201dXiao Jingting nodded and said, \u201cI think so.\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Xiao Jingting hired some people to harvest the spiritual plants left by Father Xiao and Mother Xiao on the farmland. He had 12,000 taels of silver, which was a lot of money.After harvesting the plants, Xiao Jingting did not waste any time to hire several other people to seed.\u201cHere you are. How\u2019s the store?\u201d asked Xiao Jingting to Xu Muan.Xiao Jingting was going to open a fruit drink store, so he sent Xu Muan to choose a store in the city. In fact, Xiao Jingting had long planned to open a shop, however, Xiao Jingting had been too worried about the trouble he might get in to start it before he had a protector.\u201cI have found several ones suitable. But let\u2019s forget it first. Someone broke into our house and Xiaofan also said that his toys had been touched,\u201d said Xu Muan.Xiao Jingting paused for a while and said, \u201cWe had a thief!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Let\u2019s tidy up first.\u201d\u201cOkay, brew some fruit wine when we have time. We can sell it in the shop after it is open,\u201d said Xiao Jingting.Xu Muan nodded and said, \u201cGood idea.\u201d\u201cAdd a little spiritual spring water into it, but not too much,\u201d said Xiao Jingting.Xu Muan nodded and said, \u201cSure. I know how to do it.\u201d\u201cHow many taels of silver for renting a shop in the city?\u201d asked Xiao Jingting.\u201cI found one at a good location, which needs three hundred taels of silver a month,\u201d answered Xu Muan.Xiao Jingting touched his chin and said, \u201cThree hundred taels of silver. It\u2019s a large sum of money, but your husband is a rich man now.\u201dXu Muan said with a mischievous smile, \u201cA rich man owns a lot of debt.\u201dXiao Jingting smiled embarrassingly, and said, \u201cWell, I\u2019m in the stage of starting a business, and I will be rich after this stage.\u201dXu Muan smiled and said, \u201cI have some silver in my hand. It\u2019s enough to rent a shop. Shall we rent it for half a year?\u201dXiao Jingting nodded and said, \u201cSure.\u201d\u2026\u2026Xiao\u2019s Family.\u201cMa\u2019am, I\u2019m failed,\u201d A man in black said to Zheng Pei\u2019er.Zheng Pei\u2019er sighed and said, \u201cNot a surprise.\u201d She had sent him for a search, but only on the hope of luck.It\u2019s difficult to preserve high-quality spiritual plants. Commonly, their spiritual Qi would be lost gradually after a few days without suitable containers. The higher quality the spiritual plants had, the more delicate they were.\u201cMa\u2019am, Xiao Jinfeng also left soon after Xiao Jingting left. They are moving together, which is not good to Childe Xiao Qingyan!\u201dZheng Pei\u2019er gritted his teeth. Of course, she knew it, but Xiao Jingting and Xiao Jinfeng now had a good relationship, so it was difficult to sow discord between them. She\u2019d just heard that Xiao Jingting exchanged ten mu of fertile farmland for Xiao Jinfeng\u2019s sand land.Fortunately, Xiao Linfeng and Wang Lu still loved Xiao Qingyan the most.\u201cDid Xu Muan go downtown today?\u201d asked Zheng Pei\u2019er.\u201cIt seems that he was inspecting the stores. I think he wants to open a shop,\u201d said the man in black.Zheng Pei\u2019er squinted and said, \u201cI didn\u2019t know Xu Muan is so capable that he wants to open a shop.\u201d Nothing was impossible in this world. Xiao Jingting was unexpectedly obedient to Xu Muan after he came back from a trip.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026After they made a decision to open a shop, Xu Muan became extremely busy in coming in and out of the city on the Fire Cloud Bird every day.Xiao Jingting was also busy with the growth of various spiritual plants every day.Watermelons were not a kind of high spiritual plant, so they would grow well with the technique of Growth of All Things in ten days although they tasted good, so did the grapes. Xiao Jingting also planted some fruit trees, but they had not yet grown out.Xiao Jingting sat at a table, on which were there five or six barrels of juice. Xiao Jinfeng and others were invited to do the judge.\u201cThis is grape juice, this is snow cloud juice, this is watermelon juice, this is green bud juice\u2026\u201d introduced by Xiao Jingting who pointed to a dozen kinds of juice, \u201cEveryone have a taste, and give some advice.\u201dXiao Xiaofan applauded and said, \u201cWell, you have the right person. I\u2019m good at tasting.\u201dXiao Jingting, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dXiao Xiaodong glanced at Xiao Xiaofan and said in an ironic way, \u201cDrink less, lest you will have bed-wetting at night. Daddy just put you a new quilt on the bed.\u201dVisit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Xiao Xiaofan\u2019s face turned red and he said, \u201cI haven\u2019t wet the bed for a long time. Don\u2019t talk nonsense.\u201dXiao Jinfeng tasted the juice one kind after another, whose eyes shone from time to time.Mu Shuyu drank the juice, with full of wonder and compliment on her face.Xiao Xiaofan took a cup of juice and drank it, like a person dying of thirst in the desert, who found some water finally.Xiao Xiaodong acted much restrainedly, who tasted some of each kind of juice. His eyeballs were rolling. No one knew what he was thinking.Xiao Jingting made more than a dozen kinds of fruit juice, some of which was unique in this world, and some of which was improved according to the juice on the earth.\u201cJingting, your juice tastes very special!\u201d said Xiao Jinfeng.Xiao jingting had worked as a part-time worker in a beverage store during his academic period in his previous life. He probably knew some of the recipes for making fruit juice, which worked surprisingly well in this world.Xiao jingting nodded and said, \u201cYes, I studied some juice recipes.\u201d\u201cYour juice will sell like hot cakes,\u201d said Xiao Jinfeng.Xiao Jingting smiled and said, \u201cBesides the fruit juice, I plan to brew some fruit wine and sell it. The price of the fruit wine will be higher, but everything will take time.\u201dXiao Jinfeng nodded, and said, \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhen are you going to open a shop?\u201d asked Xiao Jinfeng.\u201cThe negotiation for renting the shop has been going smoothly, and other things are ready. We\u2019ll start business a few days later. Second Brother, I will be busy here. Please take care of my business for me if the shop is open,\u201d said Xiao Jingting.Xiao Jinfeng nodded, and said, \u201cYou can rest assured.\u201dXiao Xiaofan raised one hand of his and said, \u201cI can do a favor.\u201dXiao Xiaodong shot a glance at Xiao Xiaofan and said, \u201cA favor? What a favor can you do? Do a favor to eat?\u201dXiao Xiaofan looked at Xiao Xiaodong with discontent, \u201cI can do a lot of things, I can help move things. Brother, you are too weak to do anything!\u201d\u201cWell, I can cast accounts and collect the money.\u201d said Xiao Xiaodong in an arrogant way.Xiao Xiaofan looked at Xiao Xiaodong and said, \u201cBrother, don\u2019t boast. We\u2019ll lose money in case that you collect the wrong money.\u201dXiao Xiaodong pulled a long face and said, \u201cHow can I collect the wrong money?\u201dXiao Xiaofan shrugged, and said, \u201cWho knows?\u201dHearing his sons bickering with each other, Xiao Jingting raised his eyebrows and said to himself, \u2018the two lovely boys are very energetic!\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In fact, after a frozen sorcery was carved on the box, as long as water was poured in, the sorcery would start to make it into ice.\u201dXiao Jingting looked at the box and was impressed.\u201cThis box can quickly freeze the prepared\u00a0drinks\u00a0in it,\u201d Xu Muan said.\u201cYou are so smart,\u201d Xiao Jingting said.Xu Muan looked up at Xiao Jingting and said gently, \u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m smart, it is common sense.\u201d\u00a0Xu Muan looked meaningfully toward Xiao Jingting.Hearing that, Xiao Jingting frowned. Although he had the memory of the original body owner, he still unconsciously thought about the world in the way of his previous life. Xiao Jingting suddenly found himself a little strange. \u201cI\u2019ll try to correct it.\u201dXu Muan said with a smile, \u201cIt\u2019s OK. Take your time.\u201d\u201cIs the shop well decorated?\u201d Xiao Jingting asked.Xu Muan nodded and said, \u201cYes, the shop is decorated as you ordered, and the paper cups and straws you asked are also ready. Tomorrow I\u2019ll bring the home-made cold drinks and the business will start. But since it just starts, and there may not be much business.\u201d\u201cGood wine needs no bush. Just take your time. Don\u2019t put too much pressure on yourself.\u201d Xiao Jingting patted Xu Muan on the shoulder and said.Xu Muan nodded and said, \u201cI understand.\u201dXiao Jingting took out an identity card and handed it to Xu Muan, \u201cWith this identity card, you can mobilize several servants of the Xiao family. Take it.\u201d\u201cOK, tomorrow I\u2019ll call Xiaofan and Xiaodong to go together,\u201d Xu Muan said.Xiao Jingting nodded and said, \u201cWell, these two little devils should be able to help us anyway.\u201d\u201cThere are a lot of things this time. Fire Cloud Bird should not be able to carry it. The second brother said that the Xiao family has a special Jioma carriage for grain delivery, which can be borrowed free of charge,\u201d Xu Muan said.\u201cThat will be great!\u201d Xiao Jingting said. He liked free things best.Xu Muan left early in the morning with two little guys and a cart of things. Xiao Jingting couldn\u2019t help feeling a void in his heart.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Xu Muan put the prepared drinks in the shop and was ready to start business.Xu Muan originally thought that the business would not be good when it just\u00a0started. Unexpectedly, the business was quite good.After knowing that it was Xiao Jingting\u2019s shop, some servants of the Xiao family came to buy things specially, and the friends of Xiao Jingting also came to join in the fun.The price of drinks in the shop was one tael of silver per cup, and Xu Muan thought it was a little expensive. However, Xiao Jingting thought they should highlight its high quality, so he insisted on this price. Xu Muan felt that Xiao Jingting insisted on this price not because of showing high-end drinks, but because of the convenience of accounting.There were many rich people in Desert City. Although the price of drinks was somewhat high, there were still many buyers.Xiao Xiaodong stood on a small stool and was responsible for collecting money in front of the counter.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Xiao Xiaofan stood aside and was responsible for delivering drinks.According to the needs of customers, Xu Muan made drinks and delivered them to the counter.Before sunset, the prepared cold drinks were sold out. Xu Muan went home early with two little boys.\u201cAll the drinks were sold out?\u201d Xiao Jingting asked in surprise.Xu Muan nodded and said, \u201cYes!\u201d Because it was a trial sale, Xiao Jingting only made 400 copies and sold out soon.\u201cThere are many rich people in big cities.\u201d Xu Muan said with a smile. In a small town, no one would like to buy such expensive drinks. However, people here were willing to buy drinks for children.Xiao Jingting nodded and said, \u201cYes! All sold out. Amazing.\u201d\u201cWe sold 400 copies today. If we can sell the same copies every day, we will get 12,000 taels in one month,\u201d Xu Muan said.Xiao Jingting was full of excitement and said, \u201cToday we just started to do business, maybe in a few days, our income will double or even more. Maybe the business will be better when Spirit Wine is on the market. Enough of this. Let\u2019s prepare drinks for tomorrow.\u201dXu Muan thought for a while and said, \u201cI\u2019ll find some people to help us. It\u2019s not enough for you and me to do the whole work. Some simple cleaning and peeling work can be done by others only paying some salary.\u201d However, the formula of the drinks was confidential and cannot tell others.Xiao Jingting nodded and said, \u201cOK.\u201d After working in the fields the whole day, he was almost exhausted. If he had to work overtime at night, he couldn\u2019t stand it. \u201cPrepare more drinks in case they\u2019re all sold out. If we can\u2019t sell them, we can drink them by ourselves.\u201dLooking at Xiao Jingting\u2019s tired appearance, Xu Muan said in a hurry, \u201cYou\u2019re not in a good condition. Go to bed early after dinner. I\u2019ll find someone to help\u2026\u201d\u201cOK,\u201d Xiao Jingting responded.The next day, more than 600 drinks prepared by Xu Muan were sold out again. All the drinks had been sold, but Xu Muan didn\u2019t look very well. He looked a little flabby, and suggested to Xiao Jingting that Xiao Jinfeng should take care of the shop.Xiao Jingting secretly called Xiao Xiaodong out and asked, \u201cXiaodong, how was the business today?\u201d\u201cGreat. People who bought drinks yesterday, most of them bought more today. Today, almost the same time, drinks were sold out. Xiaofan drank so much secretly that he almost wet his pants. If we prepare more tomorrow, we can sell more, I think,\u201d Xiao Xiaodong said.Xiao Jingting, \u201c\u2026\u201d Almost wet his pants!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Your Daddy doesn\u2019t look good,\u201d Xiao Jingting said.\u201cGrandfather came and asked Daddy to bring him 30 cups of cold drinks. And Daddy asked him to pay thirty taels. But grandfather did not want to pay so they quarreled. Grandfather said Daddy was unfilial in front of the customers, which made Daddy so embarrassed. He made a big scene there. Grandfather sold Daddy before, but now he came to scold Daddy,\u201d Xiao Xiaodong said sadly.Xiao Jingting rubbed his nose. Sometimes filial piety killed people! If Xu Fu asked for a drink secretly, Xu Muan might not refuse to give it to him. But it was not suitable for him to do this in front of customers. If everyone tried to form tied with us and asked for free, how could we do business!Xu Fu had a big appetite! He asked for 30 cups of drinks at first. If Xu Muan agreed with him, he would ask more in the future.Xu Muan was Xiao Jingting\u2019s concubine, and the shop was also Xiao Jingting\u2019s. If Xu Muan gave Xu Fu drinks, people of the Xiao family would inevitably say that Xu Muan subsidized the Xu family with the money of the Xiao family. However, if Xu Muan refused him, the Xiao family would feel that Xu Muan was without sensibilities. Xu Muan was wrong in any case.\u201cAnd the Xiao Family came, elder aunt of the Xiao family also came. She was green-eyed with our good business and had a chat with Daddy. Dad, you could ask the second uncle to help you with the shop. Anyway, the second uncle has nothing to do now. He has children at home and cannot go outside to work. What\u2019s more, the second uncle has more prestige. If the second uncle is in the shop, my grandfather dare not make trouble,\u201d Xiao Xiaodong said.Xiao Jingting nodded. Indeed, he didn\u2019t consider thoughtfully. Xu Muan was his concubine and a Ger. Even though he was good at cultivation, his identity was still criticized by others.If the business got big, the Xiao\u2019s family might come to make trouble. By then, the identity of Xu Muan may be repeatedly spoken out. It was amazing that little Xiao Xiaodong incredibly knew what was prestige.\u201cWell, I\u2019ll find your second uncle,\u201d Xiao Jingting said.Xiao Xiaodong nodded and said, \u201cWell, Dad, I\u2019d better go with you.\u201dXiao Jingting,\u201c\u2026\u201d\u00a0 Xiao Xiaodong was afraid that he couldn\u2019t make it clear?\u201cDo you want me to help you with the shop?\u201d Xiao Jinfeng asked.Xiao Jingting nodded and said, \u201cYes!\u201d\u201cSecond uncle, mother and father have no prestige. Those unkind people are too arrogant. You must help us.\u201d Xiao Xiaodong said with his hands resting on his hips.Xiao Jinfeng, \u201c\u2026\u201dXiao Jingting patted Xiao Xiaodong\u2019s head and said, \u201cWhat nonsense are you talking about?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not talking nonsense,\u201d Xiao Xiaodong said.\u201cMy brother, if you help me look after the shop, I will share you 30% of the profit, how about it?\u201d Xiao Jingting said.Xiao Jinfeng was helpless and said with a smile, \u201cI will not ask for your money.\u201dThe two brothers prevaricated for a while, and finally reached a 20% profit sharing.For Xiao Jingting\u2019s sudden change of store manager, Xu Muan was not angry, but felt very relaxed.\u201cIt would be good if the shop was run by the second brother.\u201d Xiao Jinfeng was a member of the Xiao family. His parents practiced Qi of eight levels. They had more prestige than him.\u201cYou\u2019ve been so tired lately. Let the idle second brother manage the shop. You just stay at home, develop some new drinks and brew some spirit wine,\u201d Xiao Jingting said.Xu Muan nodded, smiled and said, \u201cOK.\u201dNow it was Xiao Jinfeng to manage the shop, Xiao Xiaodong and Xiao Xiaofan still went to help him.Xiao Xiaodong worked very seriously. Although Xiao Xiaofan was not very smart, he could still do some simple things well.Xu Fu came again and found that the manager had become Xiao Jinfeng, he left without daring to show up.Xiao Xiaodong had told Xiao Jinfeng that the business of the shop was good, but only when he saw it with his own eyes could he know how good the business was. A lot of people bought ten drinks at a time, because there was a discount in the shop, if you bought ten drinks, you could get another for free.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Xiao Jinfeng looked at the busy Xiao Xiaodong and Xiao Xiaofan, and felt that Xiao Jingting\u2019s two children had been taught so well. They were so young, but very sensible.After Xiao Jinfeng sold out all the prepared drinks, he closed the shop and went home.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201cJingting, your shop is doing very well.\u201d As soon as Xiao Jingfeng came back, he found Xiao Jingting and said with excitement.Looking at the excited Xiao Jinfeng, Xiao Jingting said with a smile, \u201cAt the beginning, some people may buy a lot for new things. After a few days, the business may not be so good.\u201d\u201cBut after a few days, you will have regular customers! It cannot be bad.\u201d Xiao Jinfeng said. \u201cThe sales volume today has reached about 1000 taels of silver. If you can maintain this speed, you can earn 30000 taels a month, and you can pay back the arrears of that 10000 taels of silver every month, which is not a problem at all.\u201dXiao Jingting nodded and said, \u201cI hope so.\u201d\u201cJingting, today a lot of people asked for delivery service, if we offer delivery service, we can sell more,\u201d Xiao Jinfeng said.\u201cI have also considered delivery service. We need to determine the starting delivery volume and recruit some delivery personnel. Second brother, do you have suitable people on hand?\u201d\u201cI have known some suitable people,\u201d Xiao Jinfeng touched the back of his own head and said with a smile.Xiao Jingting asked, \u201cMercenaries?\u201dXiao Jinfeng laughed awkwardly and said, \u201cThere was a man in the mercenary team who was wounded by a demonic beast when he was fighting, so he chose to leave because he couldn\u2019t practice anymore. Another\u2019s leg was bitten by a demonic beast, so he had to use a prosthetic leg and could not move conveniently. However, he can settle accounts without any problems and help in the shop. The third one was\u2026 \u201d\u201cSecond brother, don\u2019t you hate the mercenaries?\u201d Xiao Jingting asked.\u201cWhen I was expelled from the mercenary corps, those people had already left, so it had nothing to do with them.\u201dXiao Jinfeng sighed, and then said, \u201cJingting, mercenaries gamble their lives on their future. Once they are eliminated, their lives are difficult. When mercenaries can make money, they are the pillar of the family. If they are eliminated, they will become a burden to their families. I went to visit my former teammates. One of them was injured and came home. His wife ran away with someone else. He was also despised by his brother. He\u2019s really pitiful.\u201dXiao Jingting nodded and said, \u201cIn this case, brother, you can make the decision. You can make a batch of uniform for the delivery staff.\u201d\u201cWell, I understand.\u201d Xiao Jinfeng said.Xiao Jingting hesitated and said, \u201cBrother, when you were a mercenary, it was very hard, right?\u201dXiao Jinfeng smiled and said, \u201cIt\u2019s all over.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It could sell about 1200 drinks a day and when the weather was hot, the business was also particularly good, the highest time reaching 1800 cups.In only half a month, he made more than ten thousand taels of silver. The high profits made Xiao Jinfeng excited every day.The drinks in the beverage shop were especially popular with children, and parents who spoiled their children were willing to spend a little money occasionally to buy a cup of juice for their children at home.\u201cHave you bought the drinks? I want milk flavour,\u201d Xiao Yuerong said to the servant who went to buy drinks.\u201cI bought it, here they are.\u201dZheng Pei\u2019er walked out from the house with a gloomy face.Xiao Qingyan had already returned to the Academy. On that day, Xiao Jingting\u2019s beverage shop just opened. Xiao Qingyan went to have a look, only to find that the shop was located in a remote location and the space was small. He thought that in a few days, it would close down.After Xiao Qingyan gave his verdict that Xiao Jingting\u2019s shop would close down sooner or later, he went back to the Academy. At that time, Zheng Pei\u2019er didn\u2019t take Xiao Jingting\u2019s small shop seriously, either.However, the business of the beverage shop just went on and Zheng Pei\u2019er had someone keep an eye on the shop. From the daily flow of customers, she estimated that the beverage shop\u2019s daily income was around fifteen hundred taels.One thousand and five hundred taels! How much money would be earned in a month?! Zheng Pei\u2019er felt jealous just by thinking about it.Zheng Peier looked at Xiao Yuerong. Her own son had become a loyal fan of the beverage shop so how could the business of the beverage shop be bad?Seeing Zheng Pei\u2019er, Xiao Yuerong, who was holding the cold drink, become evasive.When the servant saw Zheng Pei\u2019er, hurriedly called, \u201cHello, madam.\u201dZheng Pei\u2019er looked at the flustered servant and said, \u201cGo and buy ten different drinks.\u201d Zheng Pei\u2019er waved her hand and gave the man ten taels of silver. The servant was stunned for a moment but quickly took the silver and ran away in a panic.Xiao Yuerong said with some guilt, \u201cMother, so you also wanted to have a drink!\u201dKnowing that Xiao Jingting opened a cold drink shop, Xiao Yuerong immediately scoffed, but before long, many children in the family drank it. Xiao Yuerong could not resist the temptation and sent someone to buy him a drink. After that, it got out of hand.\u201cDrinking, drinking, drinking will kill you.\u201d Zheng Pei\u2019er thought to herself:\u00a0What\u2019s so special about the drinks in Xiao Jingting\u2019s shop?\u00a0She wanted to find out.\u2026\u2026In Xiao Jingting\u2019s beverage shop.\u201cA total of twenty-two silver taels,\u201d Xiao Xiaodong said in a serious manner.An exquisite-looking girl took out the silver and couldn\u2019t help pinching Xiao Xiaodong\u2019s face, \u201cLittle brother, you look really cute.\u201dXiao Xiaodong squinted at the girl and said in a serious manner, \u201cSister, even if you praise me for being cute, I won\u2019t give you a discount.\u201dThe young girl laughed and said, \u201cLittle brother, you\u2019re really cute.\u201d\u201cSister, your drinks are ready,\u201d Xiao Xiaofan said.The young girl smiled like a flower, \u201cLittle brother, you\u2019re cute too.\u201dXiao Xiaofan said in a serious manner, \u201cElder sister, you are blocking the people behind you, get out of the way!\u201dThe young lady glared at Xiao Xiaofan and Xiao Xiaodong, taking the drinks and leaving.\u201cA total of forty-eight taels of silver.\u201d Xiao Xiaodong said to a young master who stood behind the young girl.Xiao Xiaofan filled a basket full of drinks and held it up to the man, \u201cGuest, your drink.\u201d\u201cYou have a lot of strength, little boy,\u201d The man said.Xiao Xiaofan nodded and said, \u201cWell, I\u2019m gifted.

As Xiao Jingting counted the silver bills, his eyes were shining brightly.\u201cA total of thirty-two thousand taels, what a great profit!\u201d After deducting the cost and Xiao Jinfeng\u2019s twenty percent dividend, there was still thirty-two thousand taels left, which was really good.Xu Muan looked at Xiao Jingting and said, \u201cPay back the debt, and buy some more spiritual jade.\u201dXiao Jingting nodded and said, \u201cThat\u2019s right! Also, let\u2019s buy another space ring.\u201dXu Muan was a little puzzled, \u201cWhy do you like space rings so much?\u201dXiao Jingting shrugged and said, \u201cThat is a dream that many people can\u2019t reach throughout their lives.\u201dXu Muan looked at Xiao Jingting\u2019s appearance, and immediately understood.

Do you think there are other things?\u201d Xiao Jingting asked.Xu Muan thought for a while and said, \u201cThere are good and bad quality spiritual jade. The ones we came across before were of poorer quality. Aside from this quality of spiritual jade, the price of middle grade spiritual jade is between 500 and 600 taels of silver, the price of top-grade spiritual jade is one thousand taels. There is also a kind of resource called spiritual stone on top of spiritual jade. But spiritual stone only circulates in big cities. There are relatively few here and the worst quality spiritual stone should cost ten thousand taels of silver.\u201dXiao Jingting, \u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s earn money first. Without silver, everything is useless,\u201d Xiao Jingting said.Xu Muan nodded and said, \u201cAll right.\u201d\u201cWith the silver, first buy a batch of top-quality spirit jade,\u201d Xiao Jingting said.Xu Muan nodded and said, \u201cOK, by the way, how is the sparrow orchid in the space?\u201dXiao Jingting shook his head and said, \u201cIt has finally sprouted, but it will still take a long time for them to grow.\u201dXu Muan let out a sigh of relief and said, \u201cAs long as they can sprout, it will take a long time to reach the peak of the fifth level of Qi Practice anyway.\u201d\u201cNot really.\u201d Xiao Jingting shook his head. If he cultivated to the fifth level of Qi Practice just by relying on meditation every day, he wouldn\u2019t be able to feel the rising aura. But even he, who relied on spiritual spring water to nourish himself every day, could feel only limited increase in aura. No wonder Xiao Qingyan had been at fifth level of Qi Practice for the past 5 or 6 years.\u2026\u2026Sun Miaoyin looked at the beverage store across the street from a distance and said, \u201cIs this the one?\u201d\u201cYes, Miss, this is the one. Look at the two children collecting money. The older one is very smart and never made any mistakes. The smaller one is not very bright, but is very strong,\u201d The maid said.Sun Miaoyin squinted slightly.\u00a0He was not very bright\u00a0\u2013 was a nice way to put it. According to her sister, Xiao Jingting\u2019s youngest son was born with a high fever and became a fool!\u201cSuch a shop can make a profit of 5000 taels a day?\u201d Sun Miaoyin was a little surprised.The maid nodded, \u201cYes, the spiritual wine on sale is limited to six bottles per day, five hundred taels of silver per bottle, this is already three thousand taels, plus the money for cold drinks. About 5000 taels more or less. It is said that some high-end new drinks have been produced in the store recently and a cup costs three or four taels of silver but many people still buy it.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s so expensive and there are still people buying it?\u201d Sun Miaoyin asked.\u201cYes! The spiritual fruit squeezed to make fruit juice is of a higher grade, and it contains spiritual energy, which not only tastes good, but can improve one\u2019s cultivation. However, the spiritual energy contained in it is also limited, it is only useful to some children who just started cultivating. I heard that all ingredients are grown by Xiao Jingting,\u201d The maid said.Sun Miaoyin nodded and said, \u201cReally? Let\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cHello, what can I get for you?\u201d Xiao Xiaofan asked.\u201cSix bottles of spiritual wine,\u201d Sun Miaoyin said.Xiao Xiaofan tilted his head, looked towards Sun Miaoyin seriously and said, \u201cThere aren\u2019t six bottles left. Three bottles have already been bought, only three left.\u201d\u201cThen three bottles,\u201d Sun Miaoyin said.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Xiao Xiaofan opened his throat and shouted, \u201cSecond Uncle, Second Uncle, big customers come to buy the wine!\u201d\u201cIdiot!\u201d Xiao Xiaodong yelled.Xiao Xiaofan sulked, \u201cElder brother really hates me. He scolded me again.\u201dXiao Jinfeng came out with a smile and said, \u201cThe big customer is here! Let me see.\u201d When Xiao Jinfeng saw Sun Miaoyin on the other side of the counter, his expression changed quickly, \u201cMiss Sun! Wine, right? Three bottles of spiritual wine costs 1,500 taels of silver.\u201dXiao Xiaodong glanced towards Sun Miaoyin and said indifferently, \u201c1,500 taels of silver.\u201dSun Miaoyin\u2019s face tensed as she took out the silver notes and gave it to Xiao Xiaodong.Xiao Jinfeng took the wine and gave it to Sun Miaoyin, without saying anything more to Sun Miaoyin, he went to work on other things.Sun Miaoyin\u2019s face darkened as she watched Xiao Jinfeng leaving.\u201cOh my, the big customer has left. Brother, you didn\u2019t even give her a VIP card to come again next time,\u201d Xiao Xiaofan muttered.\u201cIt will not be given to her,\u201d Xiao Xiaodong said.Xiao Xiaofan was puzzled, \u201cWhy not?\u201d\u201cI said don\u2019t give it to her, so don\u2019t give it to her. There\u2019s no reason.\u201d Xiao Xiaodong held his head high.Xiao Xiaofan flattened his mouth and said, \u201cBrother is really overbearing.\u201dXiao Xiaodong snorted lightly and said, \u201cYou are an innocent little kid, you don\u2019t understand.\u201dAfter a while, Xiao Jinfeng came out. Xiao Xiaodong took out the silver notes and said \u201cSecond uncle, this is the bank note given by the woman just now.\u201d Xiao Xiaodong was afraid of losing money, so he would give it to Xiao Jinfeng every once in a while.\u201cToday\u2019s sales are good.\u201d Xiao Jinfeng said.\u201cThe sales in the last few days have been very good! When I earn more money, I\u2019ll ask dad to buy me a pony that can fly,\u201d Xiao Xiaofan said.Xiao Xiaodong snorted and said, \u201cJust spend money recklessly.\u201d\u201cBrother, don\u2019t discourage me all the time! If you keep being a wet blanket, once I get the pony, I will not let you ride it,\u201d Xiao Xiaofan threatened.Xiao Xiaodong, \u201c\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Although this shop is owned by Xiao Jingting, it is said that Xiao Jinfeng got the share of profits. Except for two kids, all the employees in the shop are people Xiao Jinfeng hired. If Xiao Jinfeng was willing to take some money for himself, no one would know it and even if Xiao Jinfeng doesn\u2019t do anything, he will be a rich man after a while.Most of the younger generations of the four major families were still asking for money from their families, so there were very few of them who were making a lot of silver like Xiao Jinfeng.\u201cMiss, let\u2019s go. Lady Miaomiao should be anxiously waiting,\u201d The maid said to Sun Miaoyin.Sun Miaoyin nodded and said, \u201cAll right.\u201d\u201cSister, you came to see me.\u201d Sun Miaomiao could not help being happy seeing Sun Miaoyin.Sun Miaoyin nodded and said, \u201cYes! How are things with you and Xiao Muhong recently?\u201dSun Miaomiao\u2019s face changed as she said, \u201cIt\u2019s fine, but he\u2019s not as intimate with me as he used to be.\u201d It was like a slap on the face. Xiao Muhong was cold to her and she was not as full of expectations like before. In between husband and wife, it always felt like something was missing.The old man came out and then went into seclusion again. Now Wang Lu was in charge of the house and targeted their family branch. Higher level people in hierarchy were superior in every way. Before that, her mother-in-law Liu Xian was very energetic but now she didn\u2019t dare to breathe in front of Wang Lu. The previous scenery was completely gone and Sun Miaomiao always felt that all the servants in the family were laughing at her.\u201cBefore I came here, I visited Xiao Jingting\u2019s beverage store.\u201dSun Miaomiao\u2019s expression became complicated when she heard Sun Miaoyin\u2019s words. Recently, the children of the Xiao family were all drinking the drinks from that shop and many people from the Sun family also drank it. Xiao Jinfeng also sent some drinks to the house, but there was simply not enough to share.\u201cI heard they could earn five thousand taels of silver a day.\u201d Sun Miaomiao clenched her fist.It was said that the raw materials for the drinks were mostly grown by Xiao Jingting himself, so the cost was mostly some cheap labor. In this way, the beverage store should be able to earn more than 100,000 taels of silver a month. This income was already similar to that of the elders in the family.The most important thing in cultivation was resources. With silver, Xiao Jingting and his brother would be able to raise their strength sooner or later.Sun Miaoyin nodded and said, \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be much worse. When I went there, the beverage shop was doing very well.\u201dSun Miaomiao pursed her lips and said, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect Xiao Jingting could actually make it this far.\u201d She had really underestimated this loser. In the past, if she knew that Xiao Jingting was so promising, she would not have\u2026 Unfortunately, it was too late.\u201cI bought a few bottles of fruit wine from there.\u201d Drinks were suitable for mass consumption, but this fruit wine was high-end and very expensive.Sun Miaoyin opened a bottle of fruit wine and shared it with Sun Miaomiao.\u201cIt\u2019s delicious and has a very strong aura.\u201d Sun Miaomiao remarked pertinently.Sun Miaoyin nodded and said, \u201cIt is limited to six bottles per day in the store and it is sold out every day. If it wasn\u2019t good, it would be impossible to sell them.\u201dSun Miaomiao clenched her fist and said, \u201cIndeed.\u201d The beverage shop of Xiao Jingting was now a hot topic in the family, and all servants in the family were now talking about it. The most promising young people of the Xiao family were now Xiao Jingting and Xiao Jinfeng who came crawling from the ground.\u201cHowever, I heard that many families want to open a beverage shop now. If those shops open, they might have an impact on Xiao Jingting\u2019s store.\u201dSun Miaomiao nodded and said, \u201cYes! Business is not so easy to do! If business is a bit profitable everyone will stare at it.\u201dVisit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Xiao Jingting\u2019s beverage shop had been open for more than a month, and various beverage stores in Desert City had sprung up like mushrooms.All kinds of beverage stores, which sold things much cheaper than Xiao Jingting\u2019s store had a great impact on Xiao Jingting\u2019s beverage shop. However, Xiao Jingting\u2019s shop already had regular customers, the drinks had a good taste and contained aura, so his shop was still widely popular. But the business was a bit worse than before.\u2026\u2026Xiao family.\u201cLinfeng, the business of Jingting\u2019s shop seems to be very good.\u201d Wang Lu said.Xiao Linfeng nodded and said, \u201cI recently saw many children in the family visit this place.\u201d\u201cI heard my eldest daughter-in-law say that the daily revenue was five to six thousand taels of silver,\u201d Wang Lu said.Xiao Linfeng was a little surprised, \u201cThe income is so high? I heard from Qingyan that Jingting was just messing around. That shop was small and isolated so it wouldn\u2019t have much business! It can\u2019t be done.\u201d\u201cThe business is pretty good. Recently the shop started selling some high-quality spiritual wine at a high price. The price is relatively high, but many people buy it,\u201d Wang Lu said.Xiao Linfeng was confused, \u201cThere\u2019s such a thing?Wang Lu nodded and said, \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cIf there is so much income in one day, it would be more than 100,000 taels a month,\u201d Xiao Linfeng couldn\u2019t help saying.Wang Lu nodded and said, \u201cYes, the second and third are only at fifth level of Qi Practice. Where could they use so much?\u201dXiao Linfeng laughed bitterly and said, \u201cJinfeng is fine, but when it comes to Jingting, if he wants to spend money, he can spend all of them in no time.\u201dWang Lu said thoughtfully, \u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d The resources suitable for fifth level Qi Practitioners, even if they were a little precious, as long as you are willing to spend money, you will be able to get them.Wang Lu was happy that Xiao Jingting and Xiao Jinfeng were doing well, but she couldn\u2019t help but worry about Xiao Qingyan. Wang Lu favored Xiao Qingyan the most and always wanted to help him out when she saw her eldest son falling behind.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I won\u2019t have time to eat when it gets busy later.\u201d\u201cBusiness is not good today and we will be even freer later, so you don\u2019t need to be in a hurry,\u201d Xiao Xiaodong said.\u201cThose shameless people on the street know nothing but bullying people. Why do they open the same shop as us?\u201d Xiao Xiaofan said bitterly.\u201cOur shop is going to take the high-end route. It\u2019s different from those who can only fight price wars. After some time, customers will naturally come back.\u201d Xiao Xiaodong said a little arrogantly.Xiao Xiaofan nodded, and said, \u201cThat\u2019s right, our drinks are delicious, their drinks are awful. What Dad makes is the best!\u201dXiao Xiaodong said nonchalantly, \u201cThe fruit wine in the store makes money, as long as the fruit wine can be sold, it\u2019s fine if the juice can\u2019t be sold.\u201dXiao Jinfeng exhaled. The price of fruit wine was a bit high. But some people still bought it. In a few days, there may be no one coming, but it wouldn\u2019t matter if there were still 3,000 taels of silver per day.\u201cDaddy and Dad will need to develop new varieties again. I don\u2019t know what kind of delicious drinks there will be.\u201d Xiao Xiaofan muttered.\u201cEat less, you have become heavier recently,\u201d Xiao Xiaodong said.Xiao Xiaofan patted his stomach and said, \u201cI became very strong recently. It\u2019s fine if I eat more. It won\u2019t cause my spiritual energy to stagnate, and everyone says I\u2019m cute like this.\u201dXiao Xiaodong curled his lips and said, \u201cThey are just flattering you and you really believed it.\u201dXiao Xiaofan was unconvinced, \u201cNo! People really mean it.\u201dXiao Xiaodong rolled his eyes and said, \u201cA little kid is just a little kid. He will believe everything people say.\u201d\u201cBrother, you\u2019re not much older than me!\u201d Xiao Xiaofan\u00a0argued with reason.\u2026\u2026Xiao Jinfeng looked at Xiao Xiaofan and Xiao Xiaodong with a faint smile at the corner of his mouth. When the sound of footsteps came, Xiao Jinfeng subconsciously frowned and looked towards the door. Seeing the visitor, Xiao Jinfeng suddenly had complicated feelings, \u201cMother, what are you doing here?\u201dWang Lu smiled at Xiao Jinfeng and said, \u201cYou have a nice shop.\u201dXiao Jinfeng forced a smile and said, \u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201dWhen Xiao Xiaofan saw Wang Lu, he hurriedly wiped his mouth and stood behind Xiao Xiaodong like he was facing an enemy. Peeking at Wang Lu from behind Xiao Xiaodong\u2019s back, Xiao Xiaodong blinked his big black grape-like eyes.Wang Lu looked at the space ring on Xiao Jinfeng\u2019s hand, \u201cYou bought a space ring. It seems that business is really good.\u201dXiao Jinfeng reluctantly smiled. When Xiao Qingyan entered the Academy, his mother gave him a space ring in order to reward him. When he was in the mercenary team, he often had to give up his prey because of the limited space in his storage bag. Xiao Jinfeng also wanted to have a space ring, but unfortunately, he never had this wish granted.The one on his hand was given to him by Xiao Jingting, who said that it was more convenient to have a space ring for business. So he forcefully gave him one, saying he got two when he bought one and this was the free one.The store was making a lot of money now, however, Xiao Jingting\u2019s way of spending money was really not applaudable.\u201cJinfeng, looking after this shop, you waste a lot of your training time,\u201d Wang Lu said.Xiao Jinfeng suddenly raised his vigilance, not because he wanted to guard against his mother, but because Wang Lu was too biased and he won\u2019t be able to defend himself if he didn\u2019t. If Wang Lu asked this, she probably wanted someone else to look after the store.The income of this shop was indeed high. Wang Lu was biased towards Xiao Qingyan, and the pocket money given to Xiao Qingyan a month was only a few thousand taels of silver. However, the business of this shop was on the right track and could earn more than 100,000 taels of silver per month.\u201cThis son knows that his qualifications are limited and he was poisoned before. So he doesn\u2019t dare to expect any great progress in his cultivation. At present, he just wants to do something practical and earn some silver to support his family. The workload of the shop is not heavy, I can work while cultivating. Mu Shuyu is busy in the fields every day. If big men become idle and do nothing at home, people will start to gossip,\u201d Xiao Jinfeng said.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.When Wang Lu heard this, she was unable to respond for a moment, \u201cIs there a shortage of people in the store? Why are they both helping out at the shop? Mother can arrange a few people to help you.\u201dXiao Jinfeng hurriedly said, \u201cIn the beginning, there was a shortage of people, but now this is no longer the case. There are many shops popping up in town, and some of them are deliberately decorated just like our shop. Our shop has a great reputation and many customers, and people from other cities also come to buy. Those who don\u2019t know how to distinguish which one is ours will look for a shop that has children working in. Xiaodong and Xiaofan are now our store\u2019s movable signboards.\u201dWang Lu nodded and said, \u201cIs that so?\u201dXiao Jinfeng looked at Wang Lu and said, \u201cMother, since you are here, take the spiritual wine with you.\u201d\u201cThis spiritual wine is brewed by you. I heard that it earns money quickly,\u201d Wang Lu asked.Xiao Jinfeng said calmly, \u201cThere is not much money. When brewing spiritual wine, we need to add some miraculous elixirs ordered from outside at a high price. Although the price is high, so is the cost, so there is not much profit.\u201dWang Lu nodded and said, \u201cSo it\u2019s like this.\u201dWang Lu sat for a while, chatting with Xiao Jinfeng and then left with spiritual wine.Xiao Xiaodong looked in the direction of Wang Lu\u2019s departure, and seeing she was gone, he said, \u201cGrandma, this time, she came because she wanted dad to transfer the store and when she was talking about sending some help, it was probably about inserting some spies.\u201dXiao Jinfeng glanced at Xiao Xiaodong and said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense.\u201d\u201cUncle\u2019s wife is the lady of the Zheng family, isn\u2019t it? I think I saw the Zheng family also opened a beverage shop. However, they did it in secret and it is not under the name of the Zheng family. Their business is not good at all.\u201d Xiao Xiaodong was full of disdain.Xiao Jinfeng rubbed Xiao Xiaodong\u2019s head, \u201cYou! It\u2019s not just a deduction, when did you get the news?\u201d\u201cI have a way!\u201d\u201cThose brats?\u201d Xiao Jinfeng asked. He had noticed that Xiao Xiaodong had a good relationship with several beggars.Xiao Xiaodong nodded and said, \u201cSecond uncle is really smart.\u201d\u201cI saw Great Aunt the other day,\u201d Xiao Xiaofan said.Xiao Jinfeng looked at Xiao Xiaofan and said, \u201cYou saw your great aunt?\u201d\u201cYes! She stood at the crossroad for a while and disappeared again,\u201d Xiao Xiaofan said.Xiao Jinfeng, \u201c\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, Jinfeng said that the cost is not low and the benefits are limited.\u201dXiao Linfeng took a bottle of spiritual wine and drank, saying, \u201cIt tastes good and the aura is also strong.\u201d However, it was of limited benefit to him as an eight level Qi Practitioner, but if it was given to the eldest to drink, it should have a good effect.Wang Lu nodded and said, \u201cYes! He said that there is added high-priced spiritual elixir purchased from outside, that\u2019s why it is so effective.\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then the cost isn\u2019t low either!\u201d Xiao Linfeng said.\u201cYes!\u201d Wang Lu was originally thinking about taking over the spiritual wine business, but according to Xiao Jinfeng, the profit wasn\u2019t much, so Wang Lu dropped this idea.\u201cJingting\u2019s two sons were also at store and when his youngest son was born, he was a fool, now although his reactions are a bit slow, he is not stupid.\u201dXiao Linfeng recalled how Xiao Xiaofan behaved, \u201cThat child seems to be at the first level of Qi Practice. Since he was able to enter the cultivation world, he is not as stupid as we thought.\u201dWang Lu nodded and said, \u201cThe two kids are helping out in the shop, but things are handled in an orderly manner. Eldest\u2019s family also seems to want to help.\u201dXiao Linfeng\u2019s face sank as he said, \u201d Zheng Pei\u2019er is a member of the Zheng family after all. When we had an accident, she quarreled with the eldest and left. If she hadn\u2019t given birth to two sensible sons for the eldest, I would have asked the eldest to leave her a long time ago, so don\u2019t let her lead you around by the nose.\u201dWang Lu nodded and said, \u201cI know. My son is more important than my daughter-in-law in the end.\u201d What\u2019s more, Zheng Pei\u2019er was still a member of the Zheng family. The Zheng family and the Xiao family had a good relationship on the surface, but they had been competing with each other in secret.Zheng Peier\u2019s side.\u201cMadam, Madam Wang had gone to the beverage shop and has not said anything since she came back,\u201d Zheng Peier\u2019s maid said.Zheng Pei\u2019er frowned. Wang Lu didn\u2019t say anything, so apparently she didn\u2019t take over the store. This was not surprising. Xiao Jingting and Xiao Jinfeng were also Wang Lu\u2019s children. Although Wang Lu favored Xiao Qingyan the most, however, she subsidized Xiao Qingyan with her own things. It would be difficult for her to take things from Xiao Jingting and Xiao Jinfeng to subsidize Xiao Qingyan.The Zheng family also opened a beverage shop, but she didn\u2019t know if it was raw material or the taste, but after opening it, very few people patronized it.Zheng Pei\u2019er grabbed the handkerchief in her hand. She didn\u2019t receive any response to the letter she wrote to Xiao Qingyan which made her really worried.If Xiao Jinfeng and Xiao Jingting continue to develop like this, what would happen to them?\u201cMother, the drink you brought back is not good at all,\u201d Xiao Yuerong said, coming out.Zheng Pei\u2019er didn\u2019t have a good temper, \u201cDrink, drink it. It won\u2019t kill you.\u201dZheng Pei\u2019er originally bought all the drinks from Xiao Jingting store, but after the Zheng family\u2019s beverage shop opened, Zheng Pei\u2019er bought a few cups and brought them back.\u201cMother, the drinks you bought are not good. Moreover, their aura is low. Everyone says that drinks from third uncle\u2019s store can assist in cultivation. Although they are more expensive, they are worth the money. Mother, you need to help me buy them.\u201d Xiao Yuerong said, grabbing Zheng Pei\u2019er by the sleeve.\u201cThere is no such thing! He knows what other people say so he followed it to charge more for a drink,\u201d Zheng Peier said.\u201cWhy not? They all say that Xiao Xiaodong could advance to the second level of Qi Practice so quickly because he drank the beverages from this shop. The little fool drinks these beverages like water everyday. Maybe he has already advanced to the second level, when I haven\u2019t advanced yet,\u201d Xiao Yuerong said.Zheng Peier\u2019s face sank as she remembered the subtle aura contained in Xiao Jingting\u2019s drinks. Therefore, what Xiao Yuerong said was probably true.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201cAll right, you just make excuses for being greedy.\u201d Zheng Pei\u2019er did not have a good temper.\u2026\u2026When Xiao Jinfeng returned home, he heard that father Xu came to find faults with Xu Muan again, making him faint from anger.\u201cJingting, how\u2019s Muan?\u201d Xiao Jinfeng asked Xiao Jingting.\u201cSleeping, he\u2019s carrying a baby now.\u201d Xiao Jingthing cheerfully said.Xiao Jinfeng was stunned for a moment and exclaimed, \u201cAh!\u201d.Xiao Jingting scratched his head and said embarrassedly, \u201cI was too busy before and didn\u2019t even pay attention that during this period, Xu Muan was too tired, so today after the quarrel with his father, he got dizzy. The second sister-in-law already looked at him, it is nothing serious.\u201dXiao Jinfeng patted Xiao Jingting on the shoulder, full of admiration, \u201cYour efficiency is really high!\u201dXiao Jingting laughed and said, \u201cIt\u2019s all right, brother. You can also make an effort to have another one.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the hurry? I need to make more money for my wife first.\u201d Xiao Jinfeng said, \u201cBy the way, mother came to the shop today.\u201dXiao Jingting tilted his head and asked, \u201cMother? What did she come there for?\u201d\u201cShe asked me if I was busy with things in the store and still had time to practice. Then asked if I needed any help,\u201d Xiao Jinfeng said.Xiao Jingting rolled his eyes. They didn\u2019t visit the store sooner but only later when his business was already on the right track.\u201cI said we didn\u2019t need extra help for now,\u201d Xiao Jinfeng said.Xiao Jingting was full of approval as he said, \u201cYou did the right thing. We only have such a small business and we don\u2019t need many people.\u201d Mother favored the eldest brother the most. If the business in the store was good and they let the eldest intervene, there would be endless troubles in the future.Xiao Xiaodong nodded and said, \u201cYes! Brother and I can help.\u201dXiao Xiaofan bit his finger, full of curiosity, \u201cFather, is Daddy having a little baby for me to play?\u201dXiao Jingting rolled his eyes and said, \u201cYou can play with the baby, not play the baby.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all the same!\u201d Xiao Xiaofan took it for granted.Xiao Jingting, \u201c\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Then, Xiao Jingting and Xiao Jinfeng sat opposite each other.\u201cYour father-in-law, what did he say?\u201d Xiao Jinfeng asked.\u201cHe said that the beverage shop allowing two children to collect money is out of place. He wanted Xu Muan\u2019s younger brother Xu Guanghua to work in the store. Xu Muan naturally disagreed, and they quarreled,\u201d Xiao Jingting said.Xiao Jinfeng, \u201c\u2026 \u201d Not everyone could do the job of a shopkeeper. Letting Xu Guanghua take care of the shop, what was the difference between this and putting a mouse in a rice jar?\u201cWhat are you going to do with your father-in-law?\u201d Xiao Jinfeng asked.\u201cWhen Muan entered our house, he signed a deed of sale (most probably means that Man\u2019s father signed a sort of contract and\u00a0literally sold\u00a0Muan to the Xiao family, or specifically to Xiao Jingting). Moreover, when he married me, he was afraid of trouble and cut all contact with him,\u201d Xiao Jingting said.Xiao Jinfeng nodded and said, \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dAt that time, Xiao Jingting was very opposed to this marriage, constantly tossing around and putting forward all kinds of excessive demands.\u00a0In order to facilitate this marriage, the eldest aunt did not refuse to comply with Xiao Jingting\u2019s demands. According\u00a0to law, the two families wouldn\u2019t have to move around if the marriage was broken, and Xu Muan didn\u2019t have to support father Xu at an old age.At that time, Xu Muan\u2019s position in the Xu family was very low. The Xiao family took a few dozen taels of silver and easily made Xu Muan break ties with their family.\u201cBut people are shameless, there\u2019s nothing you can do about it!\u201d Xiao Jinfeng said.Xiao Jingting shrugged his shoulders and said,\u201dDealing with shameless people, one can only be more shameless than them.\u201dThat year, after the two of them married, Father Xu came to visit. As a result, the original body owner ordered to beat up the old man. Maybe it was too long ago or maybe the business of the beverage store was too good that made the old man seek benefits again.It looked like they could only find someone to beat the old man up again. But beating the old man may be useless, beating his young son may be more effective. Xiao Jingting did not believe that father Xu wanting Xu Guanghua to become the shopkeeper did not Xu Guanghua\u2019s handiwork behind it.\u201cI heard that business in the shop hasn\u2019t been very good recently,\u201d Xiao Jingting asked.Xiao Jinfeng nodded and said, \u201cYes, but it\u2019s not too bad.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if the business is not too bad, Xu Muan can\u2019t be too tired recently,\u201d Xiao Jingting said.Xiao Jinfeng nodded and said, \u201cYes! Muan needs to rest. \u201d\u2026\u2026The business of the beverage shop, after a few days of decline, suddenly recovered.As soon as the shop opened, people came to line up, and no matter what kind of drink it was, it was sold cleanly very fast.Xiao Jinfeng inquired about it to find out the reason.It turned out that a five-year-old young master came to Desert city recently. The young master was five years old and still hadn\u2019t started cultivating. There was nothing strange about ordinary children not starting cultivating at the age of five, but this young master had a ninth level Qi Practitioner as his father. He had a very high status in his family and had no shortage of elixirs since he was a child, so it was a bit unjustifiable why he couldn\u2019t start cultivating at the age of five.There were people behind the young master and he was rich and wealthy. After coming to Desert city, he heard that the drinks in the shop were delicious so he spent some silver and bought a dozen cups of the most expensive new products. After drinking them, he was actually able to start cultivating.The young master was very happy to finally be able to start cultivating and he went to the shop early every morning to buy the most expensive products.No one knew how this matter spread but it was spread fascinatingly, and new and expensive products that not sold very well before were suddenly selling like crazy.The drinks that Xiao Jinfeng brought over were often sold clean.Xu Muan was pregnant, so it was not convenient for him to do things, so Xiao Jingting proposed to let Mu Shuyu rent out some fields and come to help Xu Muan.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.The business of the beverage shop was very good. Making drinks was much more cost-effective than farming so Mu Shuyu gladly agreed.The business of the beverage shop was so good that Xiao Jinfeng set up the two shops nearby.The few beverage shops that opened up later in Desert City had very little business, with a few opening and closing quietly.\u2026\u2026Xiao Jingting was walking back and forth around Xu Muan, as if he wanted to step forward but didn\u2019t dare.\u201cAre you hungry? I\u2019ll make you something to eat?\u201d Xiao Jingting asked.Xu Muan looked at Xiao Jingting\u2019s regimented appearance and smiled helplessly, saying, \u201cNo, I just ate an hour ago, so I\u2019m not hungry at all.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Xiao Jingting scratched the back of his head and said, \u201cI forgot.\u201dXu Muan looked at Xiao Jingting\u2019s embarrassed appearance and smiled sweetly, his heart warm.Although Xiao Jingting\u2019s body was still the original one, the soul was replaced. Xiaodong and Xiaofan could be considered the children of the original one, so Xiao Jingting should still want to have a child that belonged completely to him, right?\u201cSit down. I\u2019m just pregnant with a child and not a mine. You don\u2019t have to be so nervous.\u201d Xu Muan touched his stomach.Xiao Jingting nodded and said, \u201cGood, you are tired! If you feel tired, you can leave everything to second sister-in-law. I will ask him to rent out the fields.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not tired. I\u2019m a cultivator at the fifth level of Qi Practice. I\u2019m pregnant, not disabled,\u201d Xu Muan said.Earlier, when he was pregnant with Xiaodong and Xiaofan, he did not eat well or sleep well but still had to work. When the original Xiao Jingting saw him, he always scolded him. When he was pregnant with Xiaofan, Xiao Jingting always said, \u201cYou got pregnant so soon after giving birth, it\u2019s not mine at all, but someone\u2019s bastard child.\u201dXiao Jingting despised him, so naturally servants acted accordingly. All the meals given to him were leftovers, and some of them were even rotten.He still survived those difficult days. This time after his pregnancy was discovered, Xiao Jingting took care of him, making Xu Muan uncomfortable instead.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? What are you thinking about? You don\u2019t look very happy,\u201d Xiao Jingting said.Xu Muan raised his head and smiled saying, \u201cNothing, can you lie with me for a while?\u201dXiao Jingting nodded and said, \u201cOf course.\u201dXu Muan tilted his head and looked at the person lying beside him, suddenly feeling much more secure.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Why would I need a storage bracelet? I stay at home all day and have nowhere to go, so what do I need this for?\u201d Xu Muan stood in front of the counter and helplessly shook his head at Xiao Jingting next to him.\u201cIt can help you store up things!\u201d Xiao Jingting said.Xu Muan shook his head and said, \u201cBut I have nothing to store up.\u201dXiao Jingting and Xu Muan looked at the storage bracelet at the merchant\u2019s ground floor counter, when a woman wearing a green dress came down from upstairs.\u201cMiss Sun, do you really not want this Thrasher Cloud Gauze Garment? It\u2019s a rare Thrasher yarn, warm in winter and cool in summer and costs only two thousand taels of silver, so it is actually not very expensive.\u201d A receptionist followed behind the woman.Xiao Jingting subconsciously looked behind him and discovered that Miss Sun was Sun Miaomiao.When Sun Miaomiao saw Xiao Jingting, her face became hot.The receptionist who entertained Xiao Jingting smiled lightly and said, \u201cYoung Master Xiao, this storage bracelet, do you want me to wrap it up for you?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll pass. Thanks,\u201d said Xu Muan.\u201cWe\u2019ll take it. No need to pack it.\u201d Xiao Jingting took the storage bracelet and put it on Xu Muan\u2019s hand.\u201cMaster Xiao, you are a gold member, a total of nine thousand five hundred taels.\u201dXiao Jingting very readily paid the silver.\u201cYoung Master Xiao, your business is so big now. 9000 taels of silver for you is now a drop in the ocean.\u201dXiao Jingting smiled bitterly and said, \u201cWhat are you talking about? It\u2019s just a small business. It\u2019s just enough to make a living.\u201dSun Miaomiao looked at the bracelet on Xu Muan\u2019s hand and felt like her eyes were being burned by the bright bracelet.Xiao Jingting said to Xu Muan, \u201cLet\u2019s look at other things.\u201d\u201cXiao Jingting.\u201d Sun Miaomiao said in a loud voice.Xiao Jingting turned his head and looked at Sun Miaomiao, asking \u201cSister-in-law, what\u2019s the matter?\u201dSun Miaomiao pointed to the Thrasher Cloud Gauze Garment in the hands of the receptionist behind her and said, \u201cI like it. Buy it for me.\u201dXiao Jingting was stunned. Miss Sun was famous for being unruly and capricious. However, Xiao Jingting heard that after Sun Miaomiao married Xiao Muhong, she had restrained herself a lot. But now it seemed she hadn\u2019t restrained herself at all. Ah!\u201cSister-in-law, I don\u2019t have enough silver with me, if you want to buy it, you better find cousin Xiao Muhong. My family will have another member soon, so I need to make more money and support my family.\u201d Xiao Jingting said sincerely.Sun Miaomiao was filled with anger, \u201cXiao Jingting, you used to say that if I liked something, you would buy it for me even if you lose all your money. Didn\u2019t you mean what you said?\u201dXiao Jingting, \u201c\u2026\u201d That was what the original body owner said! Well, he had nowhere to complain since he now occupied the body of the original owner. Sun Miaomiao could be regarded as open-minded to say such things in public and was not afraid of Xiao Muhong having any hard feelings.\u201cSister-in-law, I was still young and spoke without thinking. Now things have changed and you are married to my cousin, so don\u2019t mention the past.\u201dXu Muan tugged at Xiao Jingting sleeve and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go first.\u201dXiao Jingting nodded and said, \u201cYes!\u201dSun Miaomiao watched Xiao Jingting pull Xu Muan away, her face turning pale.Noticing that many people around her looked at her, Sun Miaomiao couldn\u2019t help becoming a little bit irritated, \u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201dVisit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Sun Miaomiao threw her sleeves and left furiously.After Xiao Jingting walked out of the merchant shop, he carefully looked behind them and then said relieved, \u201cShe didn\u2019t follow us.\u201d\u201cAfraid of her?\u201d Xu Muan was a little amused.Xiao Jingting nodded his head, saying, \u201cA little bit.\u201d It looked like Xiao Muhong was not able to control Sun Miaomiao anymore.\u201cWhen you saw her before, you got so weak-legged that you couldn\u2019t even walk.\u201d Xu Muan said.Xiao Jingting, \u201c\u2026\u201d\u2026\u2026The fact that Sun Miaomiao had asked Xiao Jingting to buy her clothes in public and was refused, quickly reached Xiao Muhong\u2019s ears.Liu Xian said angrily, \u201cSon, your wife is too unruly.\u201dXiao Muhong\u2019s face was so dark, he didn\u2019t say a word.The relationship between him and Sun Miaomiao became more and more strained as the business of beverage shop became better and better. He had hoped that the newly opened beverage shops would take up the business of Xiao Jingting\u2019shop. But, unexpectedly, those beverage shops\u2019 business was so poor that they posed no threat at all.Sun Miaomiao was a young lady of the Sun family, who was used to spending a lot of money. Now that the second house was in power, they suppressed them a lot in terms of accounting and administration. Different ways of making money were all transferred to the third and fourth house so Liu Xian had to cut down her expenses repeatedly.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect it to be like this.\u201d Sun Miaomiao had always been unruly but she was restrained a lot after she married him. Many of Xiao Muhong\u2019s friends praised him for his ability. The miss of the Sun family became more tender after marrying him. Now he was afraid that he had become a laughing stock among his friends.Xiao Muhong took a deep breath. Sun Miaomiao probably regretted doing such a thing in the public. Xiao Jingting\u2019s shop earned the income of several thousand taels a day, so it was no wonder that Sun Miaomiao was tempted.\u201cIt seems that Sun Miaomiao bumped into Xiao Jingting in the store when he was buying a storage bracelet for Xu Muan. Xiao Jingting, this guy, showed off that he could earn some money when he doesn\u2019t know how to cultivate, but knows to spend indiscriminately.\u00a0I don\u2019t think he can make a name for himself.\u201d Liu Xian\u00a0was full of vicious curses.Xiao Muhong looked at\u00a0Liu Xian\u2019s angry expression and said, \u201cMother, just calm down.\u201d The pressure that Liu Xian was facing recently was very high, making her look haggard.\u201cThese two little brats.\u201d Liu Xian cursed in a hateful voice. Had she known that it would turn like this, she would have done whatever it took to get those two bastards killed out there.\u201cI\u2019m back.\u201d Sun Miaomiao walked into the room and gave a faint greeting to the two people inside.Looking at Sun Miaomiao\u2019s indifferent appearance, Liu Xian\u2019s anger came out. Only thinking of relying on the Sun family behind Sun Miaomiao made Liu Xian swallow the anger in her heart forcibly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You can come down.\u201dLi Qing was originally a member of the mercenary team, but his cultivation was broken by a demonic beast. His cultivation fell from the third level of Qi Practice to the second level. After Li Qing returned home, he was ostracized by his brothers at home, and his life was very difficult. Since Xiao Jinfeng recruited Li Qing as an employee who did deliveries, Li Qing\u2019s life had become much more stable.Tong Li had not been able to find work since his leg was bitten off and fitted with a prosthetic leg. Now he was helping in the shop.\u201cDeputy Leader.\u201dXiao Jinfeng frowned. When Li Qing and Tong Li first arrived, they often used to call him Deputy Leader, and it took him a while to correct it.Xiao Jinfeng turned around and saw it was Zhang Meng, but he didn\u2019t look well. When Xiao Jinfeng was in the mercenary team, he had a good relationship with Zhang Meng and Zhou Fang. At that time, when he was expelled from the mercenary team, Zhang Meng also tried to speak up for him. However, Hua Yufeng had already held all power at that time, so if Zhang Meng and the others still wanted to stay in the mercenary team, they naturally could not offend Hua Yufeng too much. In the end, they just watched as he was expelled.Xiao Jinfeng could understand Zhang Meng\u2019s and Zhou Fang\u2019s choice to protect themselves, but it didn\u2019t mean he could accept it.\u201cDon\u2019t call me Deputy Leader. I am the person who was expelled by the mercenary team so I am no longer the Deputy Leader,\u201d Xiao Jinfeng said coldly.Hearing Xiao Jinfeng\u2019s words, Zhang Meng and Zhou Fang were embarrassed.\u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d Xiao Jinfeng asked.\u201cBrother Jinfeng, the mercenary group disbanded,\u201d Zhang Meng said.\u201cOh.\u201d Xiao Jinfeng replied faintly.This guy, Hua Yufeng, had finally broke up the mercenary regiment. Xiao Jinfeng originally thought he would feel like gloating, but found that although\u00a0it cheered him a little, but his heart was completely empty.Thinking of the bad things that happened in the mercenary group, Xiao Jinfeng really didn\u2019t want to talk about it, so he turned around and left, \u201cI still have things to do, so excuse me.\u201d\u201cBrother Jinfeng, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Zhang Meng said.Xiao Jinfeng sighed and walked into the shop.Li Qing looked at Zhang Meng and didn\u2019t know what to say.\u201cHow did the mercenary team disband?\u201d Li Qing asked.Zhang Meng was stunned for a moment before he replied, \u201cThe mercenary team took on several high-risk missions in a row, losing more and more personnel, then it was disbanded.\u201d\u201cOh, I see.\u201d Li Qing sighed and didn\u2019t know what to say.\u201cJinfeng is doing well now,\u201d Zhang Meng said.Li Qing nodded and said, \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dThe business of the beverage shop was getting better every day and there were even some merchants who bought drinks in large quantities from them for reselling. When Xiao Jinfeng was out now, everyone had to shout \u201cBoss Xiao\u201d, so his life was much more comfortable than when he was in the mercenary team.\u201cHow is Hua Yufeng?\u201d Li Qing asked.\u201cSeriously injured. It seems that even if he is healed, he will be at most at the second level of Qi Practice. That\u2019s why the mercenary group was disbanded,\u201d Zhang Meng said.Li Qing didn\u2019t know what to say, knowing that the mercenary group had expelled Xiao Jinfeng, Li Qing was very angry. Li Qing knew that Hua Yufeng and Xiao Jinfeng didn\u2019t get along well. However, he didn\u2019t expect that Hua Yufeng would take it so far, and the mercenary group would fall so much that they would poison Xiao Jinfeng for benefits promised by the Zhou family.At this moment, hearing that Hua Yufeng was seriously injured, Li Qing felt that Hua Yufeng had brought this upon himself.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201cIn the cycle of heavenly justice, retribution will always be unpleasant.\u201d Li Qing shook his head.\u201cHow are you doing here?\u201d Zhang Meng asked.\u201cPretty good.\u201d Li Qing said.Although Xiao Jinfeng was nice to the few mercenaries he worked with before, he was not as friendly as before. Although they had already left the mercenary team when the incident happened, they were after all once considered mercenaries. So it was already good that Xiao Jinfeng was willing to put aside his prejudices and appoint them.Li Qing and Zhang Meng talked for a while and then left.Zhang Meng looked at the direction of the shop with a sigh and turned around to leave.\u2026\u2026After returning to Xiao family house, Sun Miaomiao began to start smashing things.\u201cMiss, calm down, this is the Xiao family. If you do this, your husband will not be happy.\u201d\u00a0The maid said in a panic.Sun Miaomiao\u2019s eyes turned red and she gritted her teeth as she said, \u201cIf he is not happy, let him be.\u201dSun Miaomiao\u2019s heart was full of grievances. When she married Xiao Muhong, she hoped he would stand out. But as a result, their house was under control everywhere, and the servants of the family were also swayed. Many people secretly said that her abandoning Xiao Jingting and choosing Xiao Muhong was like picking sesame seeds over watermelon.When Xiao Linfeng first returned, Sun Miaomiao still felt like she had made the right choice. Xiao Muhong had potential, but that Xiao Jingting was nothing but born in a rich family, who was just relying on his parents\u2019 influence to get favors.However, now her life was getting worse and worse, while Xiao Jingting was living a good life, which made Sun Miaomiao feel a little shaken.Wang Lu hated her very much, and sneered at her now and then. Xiao Muhong was afraid of Wang Lu, so he didn\u2019t dare to defend her.When she was still in the Sun family, she was a young lady, so she had never been treated lightly like this.Sun Miaomiao used to think that Xiao Muhong was a good person, but now she thought he was nothing more than a wimp.What kind of thing was Xu Muan! He was born in a humble family and was also a Ger. She didn\u2019t know what kind of wrong medicine Xiao Jingting had eaten to care about such a person and even spend ten thousand taels of silver for a storage bracelet for Xu Muan. He was not worth it when even she was still using a storage bag.Sun Miaomiao clenched her fist. She said those words on impulse today, but Xiao Jingting, that guy, dared to refute her on her face.Earlier, when she pointed to the East, Xiao Jingting would not say West, and when she said South, Xiao Jingting would not say North.Sun Miaomiao blushed, her heart full of grievances.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

For the sake of two thousand taels of silver, it was not worth it to lose the Sun family\u2019s face and support of Xiao Muhong. The loss outweighed the gain, ah!! What\u2019s more, Xiao Jingting ignored her and Sun Miaomiao lost her face this time.\u201cAs a matter of fact, it can\u2019t all be blamed on Miss Miao. If Xiao Muhong hadn\u2019t been so cowardly, Miss Miaomiao wouldn\u2019t be like this,\u201d Sun Miaoyin\u2019s maid said.Sun Miaoyin\u2019s face sank, Xiao Muhong was not so cowardly before, but recently\u2026With Xiao Linfeng and Wang Lu still alive, the situation had completely changed, making Xiao Muhong not daring to step up.\u201cIs Miaomiao\u00a0tight with money these days?\u201d Sun Miaoyin asked.\u201cI guess so. Miss Miao has always been used to spending a lot of silver. Besides, cultivation also costs a lot of silver.\u201dSun Miaoyin sighed lightly; cultivation was a bottomless pit!\u201cRecently, Xiao Jingting seems to be very well-off. When\u00a0the second Miss went shopping, she met Xiao Jingting. Xiao Jingting bought a storage bracelet for Xu Muan, which was almost ten thousand taels of silver,\u201d The maid sourly said.Sun Miaoyin clenched her fists and thought in her heart:\u00a0Miaomiao was stimulated by Xu Muan. Miaomiao\u2019s budget was so tight now she couldn\u2019t even afford to buy clothes worth two thousand taels of silver, yet Xiao Jingting bought Xu Muan a storage bracelet worth almost ten thousand taels of silver. Who was Xu Muan?! Xiao Jingting held someone dear. It was no wonder that Miaomiao felt uncomfortable.\u201cXiao Jinfeng\u2019s shop is now very\u00a0prosperous?\u201d Sun Miaoyin\u00a0asked.\u201cThat\u2019s not it. It seems that the store has expanded a lot, and they seem to be hiring people. I heard that there are caravans from other towns coming here to buy drinks,\u201d The maid said.Sun Miaoyin felt an unexplained sour and stuffy feeling in her heart.\u201cMiss, no matter how well Xiao Jinfeng\u2019s shop is run, it\u2019s only just a bit of silver. But, Young Master Zhou is still a level six Qi Practitioner,\u201d The maid looked at Sun Miaoyin\u2019s face and said.Sun Miaoyin nodded and said, \u201cYes.\u201d\u2026\u2026The matter of Sun Miaomiao being rejected in public also reached Zheng Pei\u2019er\u2019s ears.When Zheng Pei\u2019er heard it, she started gloating.Zheng Pei\u2019er was full of mockery as she thought:\u00a0Things were not the same now as they were in the past. Miss Sun still thought of Xiao Jingting as the stupid young man from that time and thought that if she hooked her finger, Xiao Jingting would still be charmed by her.In the past, when the first house came to power and Sun Miaomiao married over, she didn\u2019t miss her chance to say something sarcastic to Zheng Pei\u2019er. Later, when Xiao Linfeng and Wang Lu came back, Zheng Pei\u2019er would pick on Sun Miaomiao when she had nothing to do, and the two of them had always maintained such a tacit understanding.\u201cRight now, Xiao Jingting no longer likes her, besides, Miss Sun is too clueless. She is married to Xiao Muhong, yet she still says those kinds of things to Xiao Jingting.\u201d The maid said.Zheng Pei\u2019er nodded and said, \u201cIsn\u2019t that so? Acting like she was unattainable before but she was just a bitch at heart.\u201d Sun Miaomiao made such a big blunder that it was enough for her to laugh for a while.\u201cI heard that Miss Sun saw Young master Jingting buy a storage bracelet for Xu Muan, so that\u2019s why she insisted that master Jingting should buy her that gauze dress,\u201d The maid said.The arrogance on Zheng Pei\u2019er\u2019s face retreated.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Zheng Pei\u2019er knew that Xiao Jingting had bought two storage rings before.

He also bought a storage bracelet for Xu Muan, which meant he earned a lot of money and Xiao Jingting and Xiao Jinfeng were going to stick together.\u201cMaster is coming back soon, he seems to have advanced to sixth level of Qi Practice in academy,\u201d The maid said.Zheng Pei\u2019er smiled. No matter how great Xiao Jingting and Xiao Jinfeng\u2019s situation now was, they could only earn some silver. When Xiao Qingyan advanced to the ninth level of Qi Practice, this much money would only be a matter of waving his hand.The head of the family did nothing all day, and was in seclusion trying to build his foundation, while other people still gave him money.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Sun Qi sat in the restaurant opposite the beverage shop, glancing at the crowded beverage shop below from time to time.\u201cThe business of this beverage store is really good!\u201d Sun Qi said.\u201cThat\u2019s not true, now those little ones in the family all clamor to drink the drinks from this shop every day. They don\u2019t even want the drinks that cost a silver or two, but want to drink these that cost three or more, relying on their young age. The elders in the family are still getting used to this,\u201d Zheng Liming was full of resentment.Sun Qi\u2019s eyes reddened, \u201cI heard that Xiao Jinfeng is only helping Xiao Jingting and it is Xiao Jingting who is the big boss behind this beverage store.\u201d\u201cI heard that Xiao Jingting is dragging around nowadays and is even ignoring Sun Miaomiao,\u201d Zheng Liming said.Sun Qi frowned. Sun Miaomiao said this kind of thing in the public, causing Sun Miaomiao\u2019s father to be severely scolded by elders in the family.Sun Hao was quite ridiculous. Since Sun Miaomiao lost face because of Xiao Jingting and Sun Qi had a good relationship with him before, Sun Hao was finding fault with him everywhere.Sun Qi used to follow Xiao Jingting, but now that Xiao Jingting became rich, he had long been ignored.\u201cXiao Jingting\u2019s relationship with Xu Muan is very good now, and he even bought him a storage bracelet worth almost 10,000 taels of silver,\u201d Zheng Liming said.\u201cI\u2019ve heard.\u201d It was the storage bracelet that made Sun Miaomiao say that.That guy Xiao Jingting was really strange, when he saw Miss Sun before, he would immediately curry favor with her like a dog wagging his tail, but now he kept his distance from Miss Sun. A person could change so much. However, it was not strange, Sun Miaomiao used to be a pure and innocent lady, but now she was a married woman.Sun Qi sighed lightly and thought to himself:\u00a0If only Xiao Jingting was still as gullible as before, it would be good.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 99": "Chapter 99Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 99: 99\u201cThe spiritual spring water has recently upgraded faster.\u201d After the business of the shop went up, Xiao Jingting\u2019s excess silver was replaced with medium and high-grade spiritual jade and the high-grade spiritual jade really had an effect on the spiritual spring water.\u201cIf you have money, don\u2019t spend it recklessly. Try to use it to enhance the Spiritual Spring,\u201d Xu Muan said.Strength was the foundation. Now they were all using spiritual spring water for cultivation. If the quality of Spiritual Spring improved, their cultivation would progress faster.\u201cI know, but what should be spent still needs to be spent. By the way, it seems like someone has been stealing things from my land recently. They should have found out that what I grow is special,\u201d Xiao Jingting said.Xu Muan nodded and said, \u201cAs expected.\u201dThe business of the beverage shop was very eye-catching, so these people couldn\u2019t give up so easily. Fortunately, they were still on Xiao family\u2019s land after all so these people didn\u2019t dare to go too far.\u201cMuan, you really have foresight.\u201d Xiao Jingting often boasted about the spiritual pagoda recently, so their eyes were still on it.Xu Muan\u2019s face blushed slightly as he said, \u201cThat\u2019s nothing.\u201dXiao Jingting looked at Xu Man\u2019s lovely appearance and pecked Xu Muan at the side of his mouth, causing Xu Muan to be at a loss for words.Xiao Jingting secretly thought:\u00a0The original body owner really doesn\u2019t know how to cherish his blessings. He had such a smart wife but he didn\u2019t like him, instead, he preferred someone like Sun Miaomiao who was so willful and rampant, and didn\u2019t even take him seriously.Xiao Jingting touched Xu Muan\u2019s belly and said \u201cInside, I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s a boy or a girl, or a Ger.\u201d\u201cWhat would you like?\u201d Xu Muan asked probingly.\u201cI like them all,\u201d Xiao Jingting\u00a0said.Xu Muan looked at Xiao Jingting and breathed a sigh of relief. In this world, many parents looked down on Gers. He was despised by his father because of his identity as\u00a0a Ger. However, Xiao Jingting didn\u2019t, between Xiaofan and Xiaodong, he seemed to prefer the silly little son more.\u201cHave you noticed that Xiaofan seems to be a lot smarter?\u201d Xu Muan asked.\u201cOur son wasn\u2019t stupid in the first place!\u201d Xiao Jingting took it for granted.\u201cHe had a high fever that burned his brain out and caused some problem with his mental consciousness. However, recently, he seems to be much better,\u201d Xu Muan said.Xiao Jingting nodded and said, \u201cYes! Second brother and others all praised Xiaofan for his ability.\u201dXiao Jingting and Xu Muan were speaking when Xiao Xiaofan came in skipping.\u201cFather, daddy, second uncle is here,\u201d Xiao Xiaofan said.Hearing this, Xiao Jingting and Xu Muan got up and went out.\u201cParents want us to go back?\u201d Xiao Jingting was a little surprised.Xiao Jinfeng nodded and said, \u201cYes.\u201dXiao Jingting stroked his chin and said, \u201cWhy did they suddenly think of asking us to go back?\u201d\u201cBig brother is back for vacation.\u201d Xiao Jinfeng said.Xiao Jingting, \u201c\u2026 \u201d No wonder they thought of them. Was Xiao Qingyan trying to show off?\u201d Big brother has advanced to the sixth level of Qi practice.\u201d Xiao Jinfeng said.Xiao Jingting was surprised and said, \u201cSo fast?\u201dXiao Jinfeng nodded and said, \u201cYes! In the end, people from Bifeng Academy are different.\u201dXiao Jingting, \u201c\u2026\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201cBig brother, you\u2019re up.\u201d Zhou Kangqi walked to Zhou Kanghe and said.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Zhou Kanghe tidied up his clothes, glanced at Zhou Kangqi and asked faintly, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dZhou Kangqi said solemnly, \u201cBrother, Xiao Qingyan from the Xiao family has advanced to the sixth level of Qi Practice.\u201dZhou Kanghe nodded nonchalantly and said, \u201cI know.\u201dZhou Kangqi looked at Zhou Kanghe and said ,\u201dBig brother, why aren\u2019t you in a hurry?\u201dZhou Kangqi said faintly, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be anxious about. I\u2019m also a student of Bifeng Academy and I know exactly how he advanced.\u201dZhou Kanghe was a little surprised, \u201cBrother, what do you mean?\u201dZhou Kangqi said indifferently, \u201cThere are several alchemists with exquisite alchemy skills in the academy, who can refine pills. Every student in the academy has a chance to buy the Spirit Breaking Pill once, this pill is effective for people who want to advance to fifth, sixth and seventh level of Qi Practice. However, this pill is only effective one time, so I guess Xiao Qingyan has taken that pill.\u201dThe academy was stricter with students below the fifth level of Qi Practice, while being more lenient with those at the sixth level of Qi practice. If the cultivator at sixth level of Qi Practice wanted to go out and hang out, he only needed to report to the academy every three months.Zhou Kangqi looked at Zhou Kanghe, eyes filled with envy, \u201cThere is such a good thing in the Academy!\u201dZhou Kangqi nodded and said, \u201cYes! Otherwise, why do you think there would be so many people competing for admission to the Academy, but only a handful could get in?\u201dZhou Kangqi said with a smile, \u201cYes! Yes!\u201d\u201cXiao Qingyan was probably forced by his two younger brothers, so he bought and took that pill in advance. Most of those who can enter the academy are favored by heaven. Only those with the worst talent would choose to take the pill to advance to the sixth level of Qi Practice when so many seniors only take this pill to advance to the seventh level of Qi Practice.\u201d Zhou Kanghe said.Zhou Kangqi looked at Zhou Kanghe with admiration, \u201cSo that\u2019s how it is! However, Xiao Qingyan still advanced to sixth level of Qi Practice after all.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s asking for his own death, by taking such a high-grade pill so early when it will have such a great impact on his future cultivation.\u201d Zhou Kanghe said, full of contempt.Zhou Kangqi narrowed his eyes and said, \u201cSo, it will be difficult for Xiao Qingyan to advance in future.\u201dZhou Kanghe nodded and said, \u201cIndeed, he was too eager for quick success and instant benefits. I think Xiao Qingyan will stop at seventh level of Qi Practice at most. What a loss for his parents who still expect him to soar to the top and build his foundation smoothly.\u201dWhen Zhou Kangqi heard Zhou Kanghe words, he couldn\u2019t help but gloat a little,.\u201dThat\u2019s not true.\u201d\u201cRather than worrying about Xiao Qingyan, it\u2019s better to worry about his two brothers. I checked Xiao Jinfeng and Xiao Jingting and they wouldn\u2019t be easy.\u201d Zhou Kanghe tapped his fingers on the table.\u201cBrother, it\u2019s not true. The two brothers have been showing off lately!\u201d Sun\u00a0Miaomiao seemed to regret marrying Xiao Muhong, if she cheated on Xiao Muhong, he didn\u2019t know how Sun Miaoyin\u2026Zhou Kangqi smiled in his heart. His eldest brother was different from Xiao Muhong. As long as Sun Miaoyin was not stupid, she would definitely choose his elder brother.Thinking of Xiao Jinfeng, Zhou Kangqi couldn\u2019t help clenching his fist. He only cultivated to the fourth level of Qi practice but Xiao Jinfeng was already at fifth level of Qi Practice. The poison master who gave him poison clearly said that it would be difficult for him to advance after being poisoned like that.Zhou Kangqi had a history with Xiao Jinfeng. In the wilderness, Xiao Jinfeng ruthlessly dealt with Zhou Kangqi, so Zhou Kangqi had always harbored a grudge against Xiao Jinfeng. He originally only let Xiao Jinfeng live because he wanted to see him struggle but he never expected that situation would be\u00a0turned over.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 100: 100Xiao Jingting was helping\u00a0Xu Muan walk down. Xu Muan\u2019s tummy\u00a0was already\u00a0quite\u00a0round, and he was radiant with vigor\u00a0due to good\u00a0care and seemed quite plump.Mu Shuyu was holding Xiao Xiaofu and walking into the Xiao Family with Xiao Jingting.Zheng Pei\u2019er was sitting beside Xiao Qingyan, with a sense of self-satisfaction in her eyes.\u201cSecond brother, third brother, here you are at last! We\u2019ve been\u00a0expecting\u00a0you,\u201d said Zheng Pei\u2019er.\u201cCongratulation, my eldest brother has advanced to level six of Qi Practice. Now my eldest brother has the highest cultivation among the\u00a0younger\u00a0ones of Xiao family.\u201d Xiao Jingting complimented.Xiao Qingyan nodded to Xiao Jingting gently, and said to him with a patronizing and condescending tone, \u201cThird brother, I heard that your business is quite good. I hate to say it, but you should dedicate to Qi Practice more. Qi cultivation is of fundamental\u00a0importance in this world.\u201dXiao Jingting curled his lip secretly and thought: Was Xiao Qingyan preaching\u00a0at him? That guy was merely at level six. When his spirit herbs in the space ripened, he would get advance, too. Xiao Qingyan was seven or eight years older than the original Xiao Jingting anyway, and when he was at Xiao Qingyan\u2019s age, he would definitely advance to level six, too.\u201cYou\u2019re right, brother. I will try my best to keep up with you,\u201d said Xiao Jingting.\u201cIt\u2019s right to try hard, but don\u2019t be anxious to achieve quick success at the same time, or you may retrograde\u00a0in your cultivation.\u201d\u201cThank you for your instruction,\u201d Xiao Jingting replied perfunctorily.Xiao Qingyan nodded slightly with an arrogant look.Looking at Xiao Qingyan\u2019s arrogant appearance, Xiao Jingting once again had a deep impression on that saying in this world: the one being superior in rank crushes the inferior.Zheng Pei\u2019er focused her eyes on Xu Muan, \u201cMuan! I heard that Jingting had bought you a storage\u00a0bracelet! Then why not wear\u00a0it? Is it because it\u2019s not nice and you don\u2019t like it?\u201dXu Muan rubbed his wrist and replied, \u201cNo, it\u2019s because that bracelet is too valuable, so I have stored it up.\u201d Xu Muan just felt that bracelet was kind of ostentatious, so he didn\u2019t wear it and stored it into the carry-on small bag. He didn\u2019t expect Zheng Pei\u2019er would mention it.\u201cSecond brother, third brother, it seems your business is pretty good! Behold, you\u2019ve already wore the space rings.\u201d In the academy, there were few people who owned a space ring, and Xiao Qingyan had always been proud of his keeping a space ring. Now, with suddenly seeing both of his two younger brothers already having space rings, he had some subtle feelings.Xiao Jingting was sitting in the chair and replied drily, \u201cJust so-so, that\u2019s\u00a0barely\u00a0enough to make ends meet.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re too modest, third brother. With a good business like that, you just benefit your second brother but forget your eldest brother,\u201d Zheng Pei\u2019er said with a tone of complaint and reproach.Xiao Jingting smiled, \u201cSince my eldest brother is very busy for practice, how can my small business come into his sight?\u201d\u201cSince you\u2019ve bought your wife a storage bracelet, you must have earned a lot. Why to be so modest?\u201d said Zheng Pei\u2019er.Xiao Jingting smiled again, \u201cThat\u2019s just for keeping up appearance, we actually earn not that much.\u201d His money had been all spent in miraculous jade which was put into the spiritual spring but rewarded him nothing.Xiao Xiaofan was sitting in the chair and kicking\u00a0in\u00a0a\u00a0bored\u00a0manner. Xiao Yuerong was staring at him in hatred.Xiao Qingyan looked at Xu Muan\u2019s round tummy\u00a0and said, \u201cMuan, have you got a baby again?\u201dXiao Jingting nodded and replied, \u201cYeah!\u201d\u201cLucky you!\u201d said Xiao Qingyan.Xiao Jingting nodded, \u201cYeah! Lucky me.\u201d\u201cSince Muan\u2019s has got a round tummy\u00a0and it could be inconvenient for him to serve you. How about introducing you some concubines here?\u201d asked Zheng Pei\u2019er.Xiao Jingting was drinking water while he heard this, and he almost\u00a0spurted the water in his mouth. Given that Xu Muan was sitting next to him, how could Zheng Pei\u2019er say such thing.\u201cNo,\u00a0no, thanks,\u201d said Xiao Jingting.Zheng Pei\u2019er said disapprovingly, \u201cWhy not? Are you still missing Sun Miaomiao? I hate to say it, but Sun Miaomiao has been your sister-in-law. There is no point in keeping thinking about her.\u201dXiao Jingting felt speechless. On what basis in the world did she know that he was missing Sun Miaomiao?\u201cI don\u2019t miss Sun Miaomiao, Muan is everything to me,\u201d said Xiao Jingting.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Zheng Pei\u2019er looked at Xiao Jingting and said jokingly, \u201cJingting, you\u2019re just so infatuated!\u201dXiao Jingting\u2019s scalp tingled with her sneer, and he thought to himself: what are you talking about, you damn woman!Xuan Muan frowned\u00a0and glimpsed Zheng Pei\u2019er with a gloomy face.\u201cSince my sister-in-law is so virtuous, why not look for some concubines for my eldest brother?\u201d said Xiao Jingting.Zheng Pei\u2019er turned gloomy, but she said in smile, \u201cI\u2019m well-intentioned, but you seem to be ungrateful, Jingting! Then just\u00a0forget it.\u201dXiao Jingting felt wordless again. Well-intentioned\u2026 well, indeed.Xiao Linfeng and Wang Lu was walking out from the room. Seeing them out, all the people was silent at once.\u201cEverybody\u2019s here! Then let\u2019s have a meal together,\u201d said Xiao Linfeng.Xiao Xiaofan was pulling Xiao Jingting\u2019s sleeve and said, \u201cWe\u2019re\u00a0finally\u00a0going to\u00a0have a meal!\u201d While rubbing\u00a0his belly, he continued, \u201cI\u2019m so hungry.\u201dXiao Jingting didn\u2019t know what to say.Xiao Yuerong gave Xiao Xiaofan a sarcastic look. But Xiao Xiaofan unwillingly\u00a0showed weakness and gave back a glare.Xiao Jingting and all others were sitting around a table. Xiao Linfeng said to Xiao Qingyan, \u201cQingyan, since you have advanced to level six, does it mean that you don\u2019t have to go back to the academy very often?\u201dXiao Qingyan nodded, \u201cYeah!\u201d\u201cThen elder brother is available to take care of his farmland,\u201d said Xiao Jinfeng. Their parents had given Xiao Qingyan four times as much as the farmland given to Xiao Jinfeng, but with a high cultivation like that, Xiao Qingyan just leased out the farmland to ordinary farmers, what a reckless waste it was!Xiao Qingyan slightly frowned and said nothing.Zheng Pei\u2019er looked at Xiao Jingting and asked tentatively, \u201cJingting, I heard that you\u2019re good at farming! And you seemed to gain harvest\u00a0different from others.\u201dXiao Jingting smiled and said, \u201cJust so-so. I just did it casually.\u201d\u201cBut I heard that the field area you are taking care of can almost match that of a person with level six in Qi Practice,\u201d said Zheng Pei\u2019er.Xiao Jingting smiled and said, \u201cThanks to that spiritual tower I bought before, it seems some variation has happened to it, which has increased its auxiliary effect, thus I\u2019m capable of taking care of that much farmland.\u201dWith nothing else to do, Xiao Jingting had soaked the spiritual tower into the spiritual spring, hence made it fill with spiritual energy at once.\u201cSo, third brother, you\u2019ve got a treasure!\u201d said Zheng Pei\u2019er.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
