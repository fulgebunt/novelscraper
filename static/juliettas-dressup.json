Synopsis and PrologueTranslator: KhanEditor: AelryinthSynopsis:She was once a shut-in Korean girl, given the chance to \u2018change her life\u2019\u2026 and was born again as Julietta, an illegitimate child of Marquis Anais. She was then kicked out of the house with her mother, Stella, by the tyranny of the Marquise when she was still a child. The ousted Stella and Julietta headed to the theater on Harrods Street, where Stella had made her name as an actress, and there Julietta must grow up in this new world, survive, and hopefully thrive as she weaves her way out of poverty, and into contact with some of the most powerful and handsome nobles in the country, all the while trying to stay out of their hands!A romance novel from Korean author, Ha Bin Chae.Brought to you by Khan and Aelryinth, translator and editor of the Korean novels The First Hunter, 12 Hours After, and When I Woke Up, The World Turned into a Video Game.Should post two chapters per day (at least, that\u2019s the plan!)\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014A breathless moan echoed through the wide room, and the insignificant movement of a man and a woman reflected in the moonlight was visible beyond the shimmering curtain. Unlike the man who did not even make a sound of breathing in spite of his violent actions, the screams of the woman beneath him showed how much she liked it.Julietta, who had to stand in the corner holding her breath at the repeated sounds that began again once it was over, began to get irritated.\u2018Hey, don\u2019t overdo it, but call me when it\u2019s over. This is a freaking thing for a person to stand up.\u2019She was hot in her dress, thick with cotton under her maiden suit, and the strange smell of the room was choking her.\u2018Is it over?\u2019The man\u2019s movements stopped, and then he seemed to be falling from her body, and she was seen over the thick cloth in the dim light. With no time to prepare, the bed\u2019s curtain, which lay on one side of the room as big as the playground, was thrown back and a tight, muscular body appeared.\u2018Oh, that exposure! No matter how good it is, you have to cover it up. Oh, I\u2019m embarrassed!\u2019\u201cYour Highness, where are you going? Ahh, the night is still long\u2026\u201dShe must be a woman of considerable physical strength. Unlike most women who usually fainted at the end, the woman whined and struggled to bring the man back to her side.The man, who was heading to the bathroom in his naked body without even a gown, saw me standing in the corner and ordered. \u201cLet her out.\u201d\u2018Yes, I should. I\u2019ve been waiting here for hours to do that.\u2019 \u201cYes, Your Highness.\u201dAfter turning on the light in the room at the man\u2019s knife-like command, Julietta suddenly approached the bed and handed a gown to a woman of ample figure, naked and covered only by a thin sheet.Slap!Julietta was slapped across her face suddenly, but she didn\u2019t know what kind of sin she had committed. She was bewildered by the woman who slapped her as if she had been waiting for the man to disappear into the bathroom. However, as she was educated, she held out the gown again without changing her expression.\u201cYou have to leave the room before Your Highness comes out. Please get up.\u201d\u201cYou are presumptuous! Who are you to tell me to leave? I\u2019ll wait until His Highness comes out. Get out of the way!\u201dThere was no woman who went well.\u201cYour Highness hates when an order is not fulfilled. Will you leave, or will I have to bring servants in?\u201dThe woman, who sat on the bed with her tumbling brown hair stretched to her waist, rose coldly and snatched away the gown as Julietta turned and headed for the door. \u201cOn the day I formally become a concubine of His Highness, I\u2019ll never let you off, so you\u2019d better be prepared!\u201dUpon seeing the woman\u2019s sensual figure disappear into the gown, Julietta quickly opened the door and summoned the waiting servant of the Prince.\u201cIt\u2019s been about five minutes since His Highness went into the bathroom. I\u2019ll start with the bed.\u201dJulietta spoke bluntly to the servant, who was glancing at the back of viscountess.As the servant in a neat uniform headed quickly to the bathroom to draw the Prince\u2019s bath, Julietta began to work at a frightening pace. She hurriedly opened the window, and vented the strange smell in the room. As she took off the sheets, she took out the new sheets from the closet and changed them like lightning, sweat dripping down.Snap.The bathroom door opened and this time the man with a proper gown came out. At the sight, Julietta breathed a sigh of relief. She rolled up her striped sheets, bowed her head, and stepped back to the door.\u201cGet me tea.\u201d\u201cYes, Your Highness.\u201dThe man\u2019s order was given to Julietta, who was about to walk out of the room with the sheets, as if he had no intention of waiting for his servant, who had not yet come out of the bathroom. Julietta knew that orders should be done right away, but she, with the bedspread in her hands, sought permission from her master.\u201cCan I put out a bedspread?\u201d \u2018I don\u2019t mind, but wouldn\u2019t you be a little embarrassed?\u2019The man\u2019s expression slightly distorted when she carefully held out the bedspread in the spirit of humanity.When Julietta noticed his eyes glancing silently, she opened the door promptly and threw the bedspread into the hallway. Then, she quickly approached the tea set in the corner of the drawing-room to prepare the tea.After having sex, which was once or twice a week, the man liked to enjoy Dureng tea without exception. When Julietta quickly brewed tea and put it on the table. The man who casually wore the gown sat comfortably on the sofa and raised himself up to pick up the glass.\u2018Huck, come on! The gown\u2019s about to come off. Uh-huh, can\u2019t you squeeze your legs?\u2019Fearing that his gown would be torn off, Julietta turned her eyes hastily, and went to the designated seat in the corner of the room again, where she stood still, lowering her eyes.As soon as Julietta stood by the wall, the servant came out of the bathroom and stood mutely beside her, frowning and looking at her. He seemed to be reprimanding her for not being able to follow him directly into the bathroom because of the delay in getting out the owner\u2019s new woman.When Julietta casually shrugged her shoulders as if she had no choice, the sound of the servant clicking his tongue sounded small. She ignored him as she held back what she wanted to say: that he would have been less scolded if he had gone straight into the bathroom without being distracted by the Prince\u2019s lover.When the man who was enjoying the tea got up without a word, Julietta almost cried out of, thinking that she could finally rest. The man threw off his gown and went to bed. She bent and unfolded her swollen legs slightly and waited for the man to fall asleep.The man lying on the bed ordered her to step outside as she prayed earnestly. \u2018Hushaby, Your Highness. Go to sleep. Let me get some rest.\u2019After carefully putting out the light in the room, Julietta gently inhaled as soon as she closed the bedroom door. The sheets thrown out of the Prince\u2019s room had already been removed and the hall was quiet without any indication of another person being around.Find authorized novels in ReadNovelFull\uff0cfaster updates, better experience\uff0cPlease click www.ReadNovelFull.com for visiting.Unlike the servant, who was sleeping in a room next to the Prince, Julietta moved toward the quarters of the maids on the fourth floor. As she walked into a small room right next to the stairs on the fourth floor and lay down on the bed, she let out a long sigh at the thought that the hard day was over.It had been three months since she had entered the private mansion of Prince Killian Michael Hae Deford Bertino Austern, second in line to the throne of the Austern Empire. It was because of her purely indifferent personality that she became a maid in charge of cleaning after she entered the position of the direct maids of the noble Prince. For another reason, such people were often replaced.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",

Dress-up, Part ITranslator: KhanEditor: AelryinthWhatever she saw or felt, Julietta, who was recognized for her seemingly unprecedented calm and unflappability, had taken charge of the Prince\u2019s secret affairs at the recommendation of the chief maid, waging a war every day on hard work as her salary doubled.For example, this was what it was; a bed with her tired body was wet.Julietta, jumped up, kicked her foot on the bed, took off her thick cottony underwear and smelled it first. She put the damp part on her nose in the hope that wetting the bed would not be dirty water, as she had to wear it again tomorrow. Fortunately, it didn\u2019t smell.Find authorized novels in ReadNovelFull\uff0cfaster updates, better experience\uff0cPlease click www.ReadNovelFull.com for visiting.\u201cWhew, I was scared to death. I was relaxed today. I can\u2019t believe I laid down right away without checking my bed. It hurts my pride to make this rudimentary mistake.\u201dShe carefully hung her thick inner dress by the window. She then laid down with a blanket on the floor, wearing only one sheet of thin underwear.She also did not forget to take off the thick iron glasses covering half of her face. She removed all the eyebrow and skin makeup she had been wearing since she was five years old. As soon as she closed her eyes, she fell asleep.\u201cYes, I\u2019m going now. I\u2019m going!\u201dAmelie, the head of the prop room at Eileen Theater, the best theater in the Austern Empire, glared at her when she saw Julietta walking in a leisurely way.\u201cJulie, did you hear me? I need these pants mended by today, or didn\u2019t you hear me?\u201dThe seams of hunting pants worn by the male actor of the upcoming show \u201cLady Donatera\u201d had exploded during a rehearsal yesterday. Julietta, who had forgotten to mend the clothes which would be worn at the show today, snatched the pants instantly with a puzzled look.\u201cI\u2019ll do it right now.\u201d\u201cWe have less than an hour left before the show. What have you been doing so far? You have some new silly ideas because Lillian likes you a lot, right?Lillian was the best prima donna in the Eileen Theatre. Amelie used to mutter that Julietta had become spoiled by the embrace of Lillian ever since she was a child. After that, Amelie had been constantly nagged her saying, \u201cDon\u2019t overrate yourself,\u201d or \u201cWake up and listen!\u201d throughout her stitching.Showing the repaired pants, Julietta told her. \u201cI\u2019ll bring the pants to them right now. And this simple mending would have been done if Amelia had mended it at the time you called.\u201dPouting her mouth and not saying a word, she picked up the pants and ran off.\u201cAs you are growing up and get old, you don\u2019t even hear me anymore,\u201d Sophie smiled and said to Amelia, who clicked her tongue at the back of Julita\u2019s head.\u201cShe\u2019s already a big girl. She\u2019s seventeen years old now.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m worried. The theater is a dangerous place for a seventeen-year-old girl. No matter how hard she hides her looks, there is no one who doesn\u2019t want to go after a blooming maiden. I\u2019m worried that the male actors keep looking at Julietta.\u201dAmelie wished Julietta could do her job quietly in the supply room behind the stage, but she was walking around the theater like a wild boar hit by a wildfire, and Amelie was worried about her doing her job properly.\u201cIn case of the male actors, I am less worried, as they should consider the theater owner Maribel, and Lillian\u2019s so fond of her that they won\u2019t be able to do anything rash. I\u2019m more worried that she\u2019ll be seen by aristocrats while she\u2019s just walking around.\u201d Sophie, who was working on Lillian\u2019s dress ruffle (a wave-like crease of lace or fabric on the edge of a garment or seam), said with a sigh.Living in a theater from the age of five, Julietta was disguised by Maribel the theater owner. The juice of one of the dressing ingredients, the metum fruit, had been applied to her milky white skin, and her vibrant blonde hair had been hidden in brick-and-mortar wigs. Moreover, she wore clothes that were three times larger to hide her figure as much as possible, but her natural beauty was not completely overshadowed.As a result, Amelia and Sophie, who had been taking care of Julietta since she was young, were always anxious.\u201cI think I\u2019ll have to do something about it sooner or later. I asked if she wanted to be on stage because she watched the actresses carefully, but she said no. I just want to find a nice young man and get her married.\u201dSophie shook her head at Amelia\u2019s worried remarks.\u201cWell, I\u2019m also worried that her life would be flat when she gets married. To the common people, that look is like poison. I think it was Maribel\u2019s attempt to take advantage of the baby\u2019s beauty. It\u2019s the owner of the theater who connected Stella to Marquis Anais the first time. Well, since she was an actress, she wouldn\u2019t have been able to avoid that kind of life.\u201d\u201cIs she going to keep that kid hidden? It can\u2019t be,\u201d Sophie sighed, as if she could not believe it.\u201cThat\u2019s even scarier. It\u2019s even more strange that Maribel took on a five-year-old with compassion. I\u2019m even more worried that the owner of the theater made a very big plan and kept Julie hidden from the start.\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t we tell the Marquis? She\u2019s a bastard, but she\u2019s his daughter. He would not pretend he doesn\u2019t know her,\u201d Amelie said as if it were better.\u201cDo you think so? Unlike in the past, these days, a lover and their illegitimate children are more likely to be treated with contempt. She can only be protected as a nobleman if she is officially registered in the family of the Marquis, but the Marquis can\u2019t do that. He knows Julie\u2019s growing up in the theater, but he\u2019s never been here and he\u2019s pretending not to know. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to get Julie now. If she attracts the Marquise\u2019s attention, she would be harassed or treated badly. You experienced how the scary Marquise was when Stella died.\u201d As Sophie shook her head and finished in a sad voice, a heavy stillness came to the prop room.When Stella, who had left in splendor, was driven out empty-handed and came to the theater with her little daughter, the owner of the theater Maribel looked carefully at the bright golden-haired illegitimate child.Amelie and Sophie were really surprised when Maribel, who had been silent for a while, let the mother and daughter stay in her quarters. The owner of the theater was a woman who showed no pity for no gain. At any rate, under Maribel\u2019s protection, whether it was capricious or sympathetic, the mother and daughter began living in the theater.Even when Stella couldn\u2019t pick up her spirits due to the shock of being thrown out of her house suddenly, young Julietta used to run errands inside the theater to pay for her meals. However, not long after such a peaceful life, Maribel was visited by the Marquise.Amelie and Sophie felt sorry for the poor mother and daughter, but Maribel did not take any action after Stella died. Only then did Julietta don a brick wig and spread the juice of the metum fruit on her face.Shortly after the visit of Mrs. Anais, Stella, who had been suffering from a long-drawn-out illness, finally died.After the sudden death of her mother, before the young daughter got herself together, though it was not known how they knew, the Marquise sent people who took Stella\u2019s body.The sudden death of the mother leading to the collection of Stella\u2019s body by the people sent by the Marquise. After the sudden expulsion, Stella died, so both of them thought, the Marquise may feel a prick of conscience and will have a funeral for her.Maribel let Julietta out of her living quarters to live in a small room next to the prop room, so Amelie and Sophie naturally took care of the young Julietta.\u201cNow that little thing is so big, time flies.\u201d After mentioning Stella\u2019s death, Sophie, who was lost in old thoughts, tapped her eyes that held tears with a cloth.\u201cYou know what? Now that this year is the one of the coming-of-age ceremony\u2026 but I\u2019m worried because she does not become mature and is always scatterbrained and reckless. I feel like I\u2019m seeing a child put up at the water,\u201d Amelie sighed as she loaded the last repaired dress on the cart.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Dress-up, Part IITranslator: KhanEditor: AelryinthContrary to their concerns, Julietta was well aware of her situation, \u2018A plain-faced commoner girl with no guardian or family will easily fall as a playful target for a night and end her life as a prostitute.\u2019 Even if she would be lucky enough to serve as a lover of noblemen like her mother, she would be abandoned when she got older.Only a few people knew that sixteen-year-old Natasha, who had joined the theater company as an apprentice and now played a minor role, was raped in the private lounge of old Michelle\u2019s a few months ago.When she saw Natasha, who came to the prop room with her torn clothes and bleeding between her legs, Julietta realized the situation of the theater\u2019s members which she had only heard of before.\u2018They look down on her like this, but when she becomes a popular actress, they go sweethearting, send gifts, and are unsparing of their praise.\u2019Julietta realized how miserable it was for anyone who didn\u2019t have money, fame, power, or fame to live in the world after seeing Natasha, who couldn\u2019t protest even after she had been treated so.Since then, Julietta had been hiding herself more thoroughly in a deserted place. Amelia scolded her for running around and being scatterbrained and reckless, but she was just trying to avoid people as much as possible.\u2018I am never going to be like Natasha or my mother, Stella.\u2019 A life held in the hands of others was enough when she was five years old.Julietta got the pants mended and tried to get them to Jacob, but changed her mind. She called in one of the orphan children who had been left at the theater since he was a child, and handed out a cookie she had hidden and sent him for the errand instead.Julietta was increasingly disturbed by the amorous glances of the male theater members and the eyes of the nobles who came and went, realized that it was time to effect a settlement out of court with Maribel for her future.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013It was one day thirteen years ago\u2026A few days ago, Julietta, who turned five years old after her birthday, mumbled her tiny pink lips, as she could not believe the ordeal she was facing.Marquise Anais, who she had only heard about, came to them in the morning, and, with an elegant manner, directed people to drive Stella and Julietta out with nothing. The first meeting between the two women, who had never met before, ended in a perfect victory for the Marquise.Stella, who was crying and screaming, had collapsed and lay in the shade of the street. The gatekeeper, who felt sorry for the mother and daughter that were driven out in indoor outfits without coats to cover themselves, approached Julietta and talked to her.\u201cYour Young Ladyship, Madam is just unconscious, so don\u2019t worry. Isn\u2019t it cold by the way? It\u2019s still early spring, so it\u2019s very chilly.\u201dJulietta smiled brightly as she looked at the gatekeeper who was concerned about whether he should take off his clothes and give them to her.\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Zimmer. But why is the Marquise suddenly kicking us out?\u201dThe gatekeeper wiped under his nose as if it was difficult to answer, looking at the vivid green eyes reminiscent of fresh shoots.\u201cI heard that the Marquise finally gave birth to a successor this time; I think that\u2019s why Your Highness and Madam were kicked out.\u201dWithout more explanation, the two words \u201csuccessor\u201d and \u201cbirth\u201d alone were enough to make her guess.\u201cAha, the main wife who gave birth to a son kicked out the concubine who she has hated in the meanwhile?\u201dTo the extent he could not believe that she was called Your Young Ladyship, the gatekeeper was embarrassed and he gave out a cough in a flurry at the clever words of the five-year-old.\u201cThat\u2019s why I haven\u2019t seen the Marquis in months.\u201d As she nodded her head so seriously with her hands on her chin, she could hear a rustling sound, as Stella had come to her senses.\u201cJulie? Baby?\u201dStella, who barely managed to raise her upper body, burst into tears at the same time as she felt relieved when she found her daughter crouching a little away from her.\u201cOh, Julie. Baby, what do we do now?\u201dWhen she saw her tearful mother, Julietta, who became frustrated, stood up. \u201cMom, we can\u2019t stay here for now, so we should think of a place to go. It\u2019s going to get dark in a little while.\u201dAt the words, Stella could not say anything, shedding tears. While Julita felt a little nervous watching her mother and struggled to figure out what to do, Stella, who barely managed to pull herself up, hugged Julietta.\u201cYes, let\u2019s move for now. It\u2019s not like there\u2019s anything we can do to stay here. Why could I not guess that this would happen?\u201dStella, who mumbled impatiently, took Julietta\u2019s hand and moved on, and Zimmer, who was looking at them, spoke, \u201cMadam, it\u2019s time for me to go home soon. If you wait a little inside the guard post, I\u2019ll take you to a place where you can go.\u201dA weak-hearted Zimmer did the favor to the mother and daughter\u2019s lonely backs.\u201cThank you. It\u2019s a long way to walk to the main street, but thank you very much.\u201d Stella thanked the gatekeeper for his kindness and lamented her situation, in which she had lost her home in a moment.Find authorized novels in ReadNovelFull\uff0cfaster updates, better experience\uff0cPlease click www.ReadNovelFull.com for visiting.Julietta\u2019s mansion was on Harrods Street, where lovely concubines of high-ranking aristocrats lived. Harrods Street was a luxury residential area that took about thirty minutes south by carriage from Eloz Street, the busiest street in the Austern Empire. Stella, who had suddenly lost her place after being kicked out, named her destination a theater on Eloz Street, where she had made her name as an actor.Meanwhile, Jenna, a young Korean woman who now possessed Julietta\u2019s body, had been dumbfounded by the situation in a completely different way from what she thought, since she was the bastard of the Marquis and there would be no shortage of problems in the future.She was being kicked out to the street a month after she had put into the body of a child! With the body of the little girl, who had not exercised before, she struggled in the old carriage of the gatekeeper and finally got motion sickness.The woman, called the mother, who was just in tears and lost her mind, was just looking at her little daughter, who was distressed, as if she had no desire to take care of herself. It was a relief to see her telling the gatekeeper where to go, but she had no choice but to be depressed at the thought that her future life was like a candle in the wind.\u2018You fucking dog! If you intended to give a gift to me, you have to give a proper gift, not a useless one. That way, I am going to use it in this situation.\u2019Jenna, who could not give up her hatred of the dog that made her like this even when she was exhausted, cursed heavily inside. In the meantime, she could feel the carriage stopping; it had finally arrived at its destination.\u201cMadam, Your Young Ladyship, we\u2019re here.\u201dShe stumbled with her tottering body and managed to get down from the carriage.The darkened street was filled with loud noises and flashy lights. As she looked up at the five-story building in front of her, Stella grabbed Julietta by the hand.\u201cLet\u2019s go. It\u2019s where your mother used to work. I\u2019ll ask to let us stay for a while until we find a place to go.\u201d\u2014\u2014-\u201cWill you say that again?\u201d A woman of colorful features with pale brown hair high frowned as she put down the long pipe she was holding.\u201cI asked you how much ransom money you will be paid, the amount of money that you are supposed to get from Duke Miguel.\u201dAt the look of Julietta who spat out the words with her head raised pertly, Maribel smiled and picked up the pipe she had laid down.\u201cWhy? Can you get the money if I tell you?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll try as far as I can. You will not lose anything.

Julietta, who visited Maribel\u2019s secret quarters full of bad memories in a long time, was negotiating with the owner of the theater, plucking up the courage to bargain.\u201cOh, no, no, you\u2019re still naive. Why did you believe it was going to end at just once? If Duke Miguel likes you, his relationship with me will continue to be very good. Otherwise, wouldn\u2019t there be other nobles, if the Duke ended up with just one night? You\u2019re a rare beauty.\u201d\u201cTheater owner, I\u2019m not naive. I think the head is naive. If I were to be endowed by Duke Miguel, I\u2019d whisper into the Duke\u2019s ear and I\u2019d not leave you alone. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s the same in the arms of other nobles. You\u2019ll always be anxious about how I\u2019m going to seek revenge behind your back, but wouldn\u2019t it be better to prevent harm to one another?\u201dMaribel clicked her tongue as she watched the shabby, tacky Julietta, wearing a brick wig and changing her face to a dull color. \u201cYou don\u2019t even know the grace I\u2019ve raised you with. You know who\u2019s responsible for your safe growth so far, and you\u2019re being so cocky? And call him the Duke. Why are you so careless if someone hears about it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just a matter between the owner of the theater and me. I\u2019ll be careful elsewhere. And I\u2019m just being polite because I know how grateful you are. I am doing this to pay back the virtue that you have given me in the meantime. Why don\u2019t you tell me what I owe you?\u201dJulietta\u2019s cheeky remark made Maribel snort and lift the pipe again and take a long draw.\u201cIf you say so, I\u2019ll show you my sympathy. It\u2019s five thousand tern. What do you think? It\u2019s bigger than you thought, right? I didn\u2019t even present you in person, but it\u2019s very generous of him to offer such a large sum of money just because I recommended you.\u201dJulietta was devastated when she squinted her eyes and smiled contentedly. She never thought it would be so much money. But she could not show it in front of the owner of the theater, so Julietta dropped her presumptuous attitude and said politely, \u201cThank you for your words. I\u2019ll try my best.\u201dMaribel was surprised to see Julietta turn around and refuse to budge, even though she actually called out twice the amount she had been offered. She had thought the girl was not normal since she was a kid, but even she had an open hand. She would be an excellent actor if she were to go on stage, but she had to give up because she thought the Marquise would not let her go.\u2018Who would like their husband\u2019s lover\u2019s daughter who should be dead be alive in front of her? That\u2019s too bad.\u2019Julietta left Maribel\u2019s quarters, not revealing her inner thoughts as much as she could, after hearing the amount that Maribel said. She hid herself in the storage room next to the prop room, pulling herself from getting depressed, and began to agonize seriously.A few days ago, when she had told Maribel what she was leaving the theater, she was told her plan. On Julietta\u2019s upcoming seventeenth-year-old coming-of-age ceremony, she would sell the virginity of Julietta to Duke Miguel, thus repay the grace she had been given so far. She added that Julietta\u2019s life would be in full bloom if she was pleasing to the eyes of the Duke. \u2018Don\u2019t be ridiculous! My life would be in full bloom? Even he is the Duke, I can\u2019t sleep with a man older than my biological father, it\u2019s never going to happen. I feel like I\u2019m going to throw up at the thought of it. If I throw up on that noble face in bed, I will be done. I don\u2019t want to be dead at the age of seventeen. My life is mine. I think living in disguise for the rest of my life is better than dying naked in bed. I\u2019ll never live a life that\u2019s held in the hands of others.\u2019Julietta clenched her fist and glared into the theater, determined. And today, a few days later, she visited Maribel and offered her opinion.If she raised the ransom money that had been offered, she could try to ask for the money from her biological father, Marquis Anais. Although the Marquis had never looked for her or her mother, and never offered any help since he had kicked them out when she was five years old, he must know that Stella had died not long after she had entrusted herself to the theater and that her illegitimate child was growing up in the theater.Marquise Anais and her children had often visited the theater and enjoyed opera, but the Marquis had never been here since, even though it was his favorite place to meet Stella and court her. Maybe he knew she was here and he was avoiding her.But the day before, Morgan, who managed the opera\u2019s VIP seats, told her that he would prepare his favorite wine and refreshments because the Marquise would be attending the next performance on opening day.Julietta thought this was an opportunity from heaven. In fact, if the Marquis didn\u2019t visit the theater, she had to try to meet him by all means. For the first time since she had started living in the theater, she heard that her biological father would visit. It was thought that this incident was a sign that things might be going well.But the amount Maribel had told her was bigger than she thought, and she was disappointed. \u2018Will the Marquis want to pay that amount? Isn\u2019t that a big sum for the nobles?\u2019Julietta, who lived in the theater and had never touched money, could only see that it was a huge sum of money, but could not realize how big the sum was.\u201cI have no choice but to bump into it, whether it works or not. If I am not going to be held up in the hands of a lascivious man, I need to stay alert and get the money.\u201dJulietta waited for the day the Marquis would arrive, determined not to become depressed.\u2014\u2014\u2013\u201cMorgan, is that Marquis Anais?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s him. It\u2019s been ten years since I saw him when he was young, but he\u2019s still handsome. I guess he\u2019s not even old.\u201dAs Morgan spoke, a man dressed up in a grey coat was being escorted to the seat. It was refreshing to see the aristocratic figure walking with the guide in an elegant manner, while hidden in the corner.Although she was told that he sometimes visited and played with her when she was a child, she barely remembered seeing the Marquis since she was five years old when she put into this body. At first glance, she remembered the much younger Marquis, but she couldn\u2019t remember anything in detail. Since then, he had stopped going in and out of his lover\u2019s home due to the birth of his successor.A light-skinned pink-tinted blonde, with green eyes, and an unpredictable sleek, solid body could hardly be believed to have a child of Julietta\u2019s age. That man in front of her was the one who had abandoned herself and her mother irresponsibly.She felt bitter when she thought about it, but she missed him.Julietta was determined to be weak. This man was a heartless man who left his young child alone. Parents are the ones who should take responsibility for having children. Since he had so far abandoned his duty, it would not be too much to ask him to offer 5,000 terns for himself.Julietta kept an eye on the man, with a throbbing chest tight and looking for a chance to ask for money.\u201cFather?\u201d She was looking at the back of the Marquis who was going to the opera box, hidden invisibly, but the lady with the gleaming brown hair lovingly stretched out of the box seat welcomed him. Julietta, who had seen his appearance, started trying to talk to him, but hid in the dark shade again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Dress-up, Part IVTranslator: KhanEditor: Aelryinth\u201cI\u2019m very glad you kept your promise. I know you don\u2019t like opera, but since it\u2019s my birthday for the coming-of-age ceremony, I wanted to enjoy it with my dad and eat at a restaurant. Mom and Pierre will be here soon.\u201dA slim beauty with brown hair, grinned and clasped his arms affectionately toward the Marquis, opening the box door and entering. Julietta, who was staring at them, turned away, her face expressionless.She had fallen under the illusion. Even though he was her biological father, he had not seen her face for more than ten years and did not care if she was doing well.Now he wouldn\u2019t hear her say, \u2018Your daughter\u2019s for sale, give me five thousand terns.\u2019 If there had been a love like that, he wouldn\u2019t have left her at this dangerous theater so far, which was full of all sorts of perverts.Julietta briefly spoke ill of herself, being so mistaken for a while, and a few days later she went back to Maribel.\u2014\u2014-\u201cWhat did you say?\u201dFind authorized novels in ReadNovelFull\uff0cfaster updates, better experience\uff0cPlease click www.ReadNovelFull.com for visiting.\u201cGive me an eighty-month installment plan.\u201dMaribel opened her mouth with astonishment and could not speak. While looking at the girl in front of her for a long time to see if she was joking, she became angry when she realized that Julietta was sincere.\u201cIf you\u2019re playing, get out. I\u2019m not free enough to joke with you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not joking. Does anyone joke about what\u2019s at stake in their life?\u201d\u201cSo, are you serious?\u201d\u201cYes. I\u2019ll pay you back by the time you get five thousand terns by working. When I found out what I could make a month, it would be about seventy terns. So I think I\u2019ll be able to make it up in eighty months.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m speechless. Why should I listen to your words in a situation where I can earn five thousand terns right away?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll get my gratitude and my grace. On the other hand, if you don\u2019t listen to the offer, you\u2019ll get my grudges and my revenge.\u201dMaribel remained silent for a moment at the sight of the proposing girl\u2019s glare.Julietta was not a commoner, but the illegitimate child of a Marquis. Half of her was a mixture of aristocratic blood. Even if the bloodline was of little use now, she was not sure what was going to happen. Furthermore, she was smart, and had the guts and grandeur that wouldn\u2019t easily back down.Maribel admitted that something troublesome might happen later, and then she spoke soothingly to the girl in front of her.\u201cAll right. I\u2019ll take your offer. But I\u2019m sure you naturally thought about the interest because you are going to split the money and pay it back over six years, right? What about the interest?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s call it even with that I\u2019ve been working at the theater. Since you get five thousand terns for your kindness which you have raised me, shouldn\u2019t I get paid for my unpaid work in the theater? Let\u2019s calculate it as interest.\u201dWatching Julietta talking to her clearly as if she was not willing to lose any money or be under debt to her, Maribel thought, I shouldn\u2019t let this jewel of a child go.However, she gave up her reluctance and nodded, thinking that she would be in danger if the girl came back, bearing a grudge against her\u2026She seemed to be more affectionate of this desultory child than she thought.\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll take your offer. Let\u2019s write a promissory note. It\u2019s good to be accurate about anything. Let\u2019s also make it clear that if you can\u2019t pay back all five thousand terns in the eighty months you specify, you\u2019ll have to sell yourself and pay it back.\u201dAfter checking the contents of the promissory note which Maribel wrote and gave her, Julietta declined to sign it while asking, \u201cI\u2019d like to make another copy, please. I need two witnesses. I\u2019ll check the two promissory notes with the signatures of two witnesses on them and I\u2019ll sign them.\u201dMaribel laughed at the smarts and boldness of the girl who grew up inside the theater without much education, although she learned simple writing and manners with the theater\u2019s apprentices.\u201cYes, I got it. I\u2019ll get the witnesses. I will call you as soon as they are ready, won\u2019t I?\u201d\u201cYes. I\u2019ll leave the theater if I get the promissory note. I have to go out and make money so I can pay it back.\u201d\u2014\u2014A few days after the conclusion with Maribel, Julietta told Amelie and Sophie, who had raised her, her plan.\u201cYou\u2019ve decided to leave the theater?\u201d Amelie was dumbfounded by Julietta\u2019s sudden remarks.\u201cYes, I have to live my life now. Amelie said the theater is the most dangerous place for a commoner girl who just had their coming-of-age ceremony.\u201d\u201cYes, I did. But what can you do out there?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to be a maid.\u201d\u201cMaid?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cDo you know what a dangerous job that is? It\u2019s a job that you can\u2019t go anywhere and complain about, even if you\u2019re raped by visitors coming and going.\u201d\u201cIf I\u2019m an extremely fat and ugly maid, I shouldn\u2019t have to worry about that.\u201d\u201cAre you going to live as a maid and not remove that make-up?\u201dJulietta nodded at Amelia\u2019s words. \u201cYes. And I\u2019ll dress up myself fat with cotton in my clothes, too.\u201dSophie asked Julietta in a worried voice, \u201cDo you think you can work if you\u2019re uncomfortable?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not in a position to be choosy.\u201d Julietta murmured, recalling the time when her fate had changed in a moment-thirteen years ago, and her soul was moved to a five-year-old child\u2019s body. She had been so embarrassed.\u2014\u2014Jenna had been eating dinner alone, her companion a TV screen which had not worked well for the last few days.Two years ago, after her parents had died suddenly in a car accident, she hated the house being so lonely, so much that she turned on the TV when she was at home and even when she was sleeping. It seemed like it was broken. She didn\u2019t want to call the AS center, so she let it go, and now the buzzing noise was fine.On that day, Jenna was watching TV without thinking, and suddenly the screen, which had been scattered in various colors, was arranged and turned white. As she looked into the changed screen, thinking it was fixed, a white room appeared, and in the middle of the room, she saw a multi-vision, a device that created a single image on multiple screens or created a different image.\u201cIs it a drama? But there\u2019s no one here, so why would it just show me a vacant room?\u201dAfter ten minutes of constant exposure to the same scene, Jenna thought it was weird, so she started to search for a remote control and press it everywhere.\u201cWell, it must be broken again.\u201dShe was turning around to clear the table, thinking, \u2018Either I will call the AS Center or buy a new one for second-hand tomorrow,\u2019 when she heard a voice.\u201cAre you dreaming of a colorful life? Do you dream of a new world? Call me anytime if you want to get out of your current life. My name is Manny.\u201dSurprised by the sudden needlessly bright, and cheerful voice, Jenna looked back, and there was now a cute little dog inside a TV screen.She thought that she might have been under too much pressure after adding another part-time job to pay for next semester\u2019s tuition, and she shook her head to regain her focus. At that moment, she heard the voice again.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with your body. This is an opportunity. You have been chosen. If you want to escape from your hard life, you just have to call out \u2018Manny.'\u201d\u201cManny? Am I finally going crazy? It\u2019s a poor life with no friends, no parents, and a hundred thousand won a month, but I don\u2019t want to go crazy,\u201d Jenna muttered in a melancholic voice and heard the same voice again.\u201cWell, it sounds like a very dark life. How do you feel? Just call \u2018Manny\u2019 once and everything will change. I\u2019ll bet.\u201d\u201cTrust you? I don\u2019t know if this is real or a dream. What do you want me to believe?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re confused, so just call me by my name, and you have nothing to lose. Manny Manny Manny Manny.\u201dJenna finally replied, irritated by the unidentifiable dog pretending to be friendly, saying Manny, Manny. \u201cWhew, you are noisy. Manny! Okay?

You made a really good choice.\u201dAs soon as the dog Manny shouted in an excited voice, Jenna\u2019s surroundings suddenly began to change.\u201cWhat? What is this?\u201d Jenna screamed in amazement as she found herself standing in the missing white room which appeared inside the screen for a moment earlier and disappeared.\u201cWelcome to the room of opportunity. How do you feel? It\u2019s really cool, isn\u2019t it?\u201dThere were six multi-visions in the small room with nothing, but Manny was very proud of itself.\u201cHuh?\u2026 But when are you leaving my dream?\u201d Jenna, convinced that the current situation was a dream, accepted it with an impassive voice.Manny exclaimed happily, \u201cOh! Yes. You must want to wake up from your dream right away. It\u2019s not a dream, but it doesn\u2019t matter. Now, it\u2019s choice time for your new world. Which of the six screens in front of you is your favorite?\u201dJenna, who struggled to ignore what was not a dream, turned to the six screens.The first screen showed images of armor-clad knights lined up in a row in front of the flag-waving castle against the backdrop of the Middle Ages.The second screen showed an Indian, as if in the Wild West, and gunmen chasing them on horseback. Jenna, who frowned at the two backdrops with no romance at all, turned to the next screen.The third was the scene of a giant, wearing a Viking\u2019s helmet, arriving at the shore and looting the town, while the fourth was the scene of women in colorful Harlem smoking cigarettes and chatting.Jenna turned to the fifth screen, flustered by the scenes being shown. In a large banquet hall, a thin red-haired woman in a silver dress and a handsome, silver-haired man in a blue robe danced. Jenna turned to the last screen, thinking for a moment about the colorful costumes of the people and the ballroom, which was like a scene from a fairy tale.There was a scene where a beautiful woman was sitting on a luxurious bed hugged a baby. The last screen, caught between grandeur, dynamism, languor, and glamour, made her more relaxed. Jenna touched the last screen without hesitation.\u201cOh! You liked that screen. That\u2019s an unusual taste. It\u2019s great to see you choose a different world with only two. I\u2019m glad you have a good eye. But there\u2019s one thing that\u2019s missing. I can\u2019t send a new soul to the world you choose. Moving the dimension, the newly born soul is limited by one every fifty years. We still have five years left before the next birth. I don\u2019t know what to do with this\u2026\u201d\u201cWait, what are you talking about? What\u2019s with this world at a different dimension, and what\u2019s the new soul? No matter how dreamy it is, it\u2019s a little\u2026\u201d Jenna poured out her words without hiding her embarrassment, but the dog ignored it and continued speaking calmly.\u201cManny is a dimension manager who keeps its promise. I\u2019ll have to find an empty body that has lost its soul in a sudden accident.\u201d\u201c\u2026 manage a dimension? But it\u2019s weird enough that a dog talks, so it wouldn\u2019t be a big deal for a dog to manage it.\u201d Jenna murmured in desperation, thinking she was having a great dream.\u201cI promised to get you out of your current life. Just trust this Manny. Manny is a friend of Jenna\u2019s. Are you ready?\u201d\u201cWait, ready? What ready? What\u2019s the matter with you? I am nervous!\u201d\u201cManny is so happy. Here we go. One, two, three!\u201d\u201cCome on, hold on! Stop! Wait!\u201dJenna hurriedly stopped the dog who was excitedly tapping something on the keyboard in front of the monitor.\u201cJenna, do you have anything to say? The command to move to another dimension is quite complex and I have to focus. If there is something wrong, you might fall into an unknown dimension!\u201d Manny muttered discontentedly and urged Jenna to hurry up if she had anything to say.Jenna decided to enjoy this fun dream properly and began to quibble according to her usual clear personality. \u201cI heard I am getting out of my current life. You said that I would not be born again, and I would go into another body that I don\u2019t know who it is. However, I don\u2019t like it either. Take it back. I\u2019ll go into the fifth screen which I saw earlier.\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019ve already chosen once, you can\u2019t take it back. Decide whether you give up the opportunity or accept the life you have chosen.\u201d\u201cYou are so cheap. Taking back a move is accepted in a chess game, but I don\u2019t have enough time to make life-threatening choices. Take it back, take it back, or cut my belly!\u201d\u201cWhat cutting your belly? It\u2019s a cruel thing to do. Manny refuses it!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re making a person mad. Can\u2019t you really take it back?\u201d\u201cNo, I can\u2019t.\u201d\u201cThen you had to explain it well from the beginning. I would have chosen carefully if you had warned me that there is a person\u2019s life that I should be involved in, among six lives. You\u2019re guilty of dereliction of duty.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have anything to say, do you? Then compromise with me.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of compromise are you talking about? Manny doesn\u2019t want to make that compromise.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll accept the life I choose, so give me the ability to do something good. Shouldn\u2019t I have any ability to move on to another dimension? I don\u2019t want to suffer from any hardship, so give me the ability to do something useful.\u201d\u201cWhat ability do you mean?\u201d\u201cWell, you know what? I can get a good job and live in a good place, I can become a lawyer or a politician because I have a great deal of eloquence, or I have a great athletic talent. Anyways, you know something that\u2019s better than others. Give me one of those.\u201d\u201cI can do that, but I can\u2019t tell you which one you will take because it\u2019s randomly assigned.\u201d\u201cWhat? That\u2019s nonsense! A dimension dog that can move a person into another dimension can\u2019t give her the power she wants! Somehow, I felt uneasy about the fact that a small dog is on such a heavy duty as a dimension manager. You have to be honest. You\u2019re lying about being a dimension manager, aren\u2019t you? You don\u2019t have the slightest ability, do you?\u201d\u201cWhat kind of words are you hitting me with? You don\u2019t have to take it if you don\u2019t want it. Manny is a super dog with a tremendous ability to get in and out of all dimensions.\u201dAt the sulky voice of Manny, Jenna thought, \u2018Am I too much excited as this is just a dream? Or in any case, who cares?\u2019\u201cI\u2019m dreaming about Manny\u2019s voice, but I think I\u2019m so excited,\u201d said Jenna, with a smile on her face.\u201cNot bad, is it?\u201dFind authorized novels in ReadNovelFull\uff0cfaster updates, better experience\uff0cPlease click www.ReadNovelFull.com for visiting.\u201cYes, it\u2019s not bad because it\u2019s better than others.\u201d\u201cAll right.

The next moment, the surroundings lit up, whether or not she was about to wake up from her dream.\u201cYou stupid shithead. Is this the ability I got?\u201dThe ability was that she was the most beautiful woman of all.Jenna, who had woken up from sleep, said, \u201cI can\u2019t believe it!\u201d when she realized that everything she had thought was a dream was real, and that she had woken up in the body of a little kid in a scary lace nightgown.When she finally woke up from shock and tried to face reality, a screen suddenly appeared in the air, dancing like it was teasing her. The glittering screen displayed colorful, glittering letters that did not exist in the world.\u2018A more beautiful ability than anyone else. Congratulations on your new body! You can\u2019t find anyone more beautiful than Jenna, who grew up with her body. Aging will be two or three times slower than others, and if anyone is praised for being more beautiful than Jenna, she will be gone.The command is \u2018more beautiful than Julietta,\u2019 using the name registered in her family registry.

It was only after a memoryless week that she could recover her sense of self, but before she could get used to her new life, the Marquise invaded her house on Harrods Street, and her arduous journey began.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\u201cHave you got a place to work? You\u2019re not saying you\u2019re going out there unconditionally, are you?\u201dWhen Amelie\u2019s question continued, Julietta, who had been thinking about the exasperation of the past, returned to reality.\u201cLillian introduced me to the Bertino mansion as a maid.\u201d\u201cLillian? Ah, Lillian\u2019s current lover is Marquis Rhodius. The Marquis must have connected you.\u201d\u201cYes. I can work as a cleaning maid in the mansion where the prince visits from time to time, rather than the Bertino main house.\u201d\u201cAh, it must be a house for women to call in.\u201d\u201cWomen?\u201d\u201cThe sex life of Prince Bertino is famous.

You don\u2019t have to worry about me. Besides, they won\u2019t place a beginner like me in the owner\u2019s bedroom or in his own private room.\u201d\u201cYes, I suppose so. Anyway, you have to be very careful. I\u2019m afraid what will unfold in front of you if your disguise is removed.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Julietta grinned with her fist clenched as if she was confident.\u2014\u2014The Austern Empire was a country located in the western part of the Lenaid continent, divided it into two, ruled by the Vicern Empire in the east.The Austern Empire, which led all the trends within the continent, had a luxurious and hedonistic atmosphere. Its capital Dublin was the continent\u2019s best cultural center, where art, poetry, literature, and opera developed.In Dublin, there was the Eileen Theater, where Julietta grew up on Eloz Street, famous for entertainment and shopping all over the continent. The five-story opera house was bustling early in the morning, preparing to greet the Empire\u2019s greatest guest in a long time.Actors visited the dressing room for today\u2019s performance in person, checked meticulously, and were fretful.The five-story opera house was bustling early in the morning, preparing to greet the Empire\u2019s greatest guest in a long time. Actors visited the dressing room for today\u2019s performance in person, checked meticulously, and were fretful. The owner of the theater, Maribel, who usually didn\u2019t come out of her living quarters, also made a rare stroll around the theater for inspection in the afternoon.Julietta, who had negotiated with Maribel a few days ago and filled out a promissory note with two witnesses, was due to leave the theater a week later. With the help of Lillian, who loved her wit, she was able to get a recommendation letter from Marquis Rhodius.Going out to the outside world for the first time in a decade, she was far from the chaos going on, making special underclothes to wear for the job in her own small room next to the prop room. Julietta, who was making two sets out of the fabric that Amelia had given her, hummed for about a new future, thinking that she would soon get out of this dark room.\u201cI\u2019m going to have to put on these thick clothes for a while, but now I can plan and move on to my future. A life without a penny given is over!\u201dThough she had not had her coming-of-age ceremony, her breasts showed a satisfactory development, unlike the old days of Jenna. They were a hindrance to her now. Julietta had not noticed the sound of anyone calling her while she adding cotton to the waist of her thin chemise, a women\u2019s garment that ran from shoulder to her thigh, to hide her voluptuous breasts.\u201cJulie, didn\u2019t you hear me calling? The owner of the theater is calling, so get out of here.\u201dSophie, who was in the prop room, came over and urged Julietta, who did not move even after she called for a while.\u201cThe owner of the theater? Why me?\u201d Julietta complained. She wanted to enjoy her vacation for a while until she started working as a maid, as she was not allowed to work in the theater until she left. She frowned without realizing it.\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know. Come on, hurry. She doesn\u2019t like to be kept waiting. Be careful not to look hateful until you get out of the theater.\u201dAt Sophie\u2019s urging, as Julietta hurried out into the dark hallway, Maribel was standing in front of the small room.\u201cWhat did you do, and why did you pretend not to hear me?\u201dJulietta replied quickly at the shrill voice. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I couldn\u2019t hear you calling because I was concentrating on preparing my clothes to wear at work.\u201dAfter Julietta apologized politely as Sophie advised, Maribel said in a slightly softer voice, \u201cI told you to not work until you leave, but you should help out today. If you don\u2019t want to do it, I can\u2019t help it, because you are in a situation with a promissory note, but I think it\u2019s okay to help me for a day if you think of the affection which I raised you with.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? You don\u2019t have any other conspiracy, right?\u201dMaribel snorted as she thought, \u2018Look before you leap.\u2019 \u201cI\u2019m not mean enough to use other means for the story that\u2019s already finished, baby. I\u2019m literally short-handed, so don\u2019t doubt me. I came and said it myself because I think you\u2019ll rebel against someone if I had someone else manage you. Do you understand?\u201dJulietta eased her doubts at Maribel\u2019s unassuming remark, shrugged, and accepted. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but it\u2019s not a bad thing to be careful about everything, so please understand. What do I do?\u201d\u201cHis Highness and Marquis Rhodius will be visiting the opera today. When they\u2019re watching, we need someone to run errands next to them, but women fight pulling the hair off one another over the job. I think you\u2019re the right person who doesn\u2019t have a different mind. You are the only one who\u2019ll go and do things that won\u2019t stand out.\u201dThe place to work for a week was Prince Killian\u2019s private mansion. Julietta asked with a quivering voice, \u201cWhat a coincidence\u2026\u201d\u201cDo I have to go? I heard that the Prince likes women very much, so wouldn\u2019t it be okay for another one to go?\u201d\u201cThe Prince may have a lot of female bias, but he doesn\u2019t like women enough to forgive anyone being rash. They don\u2019t know who they are and might arouse his anger, so I can\u2019t send fire moths to a place where they might die, can I, baby?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Dress-up, Part VIITranslator: KhanEditor: AelryinthUnder Maribel\u2019s continued coercion, Julietta was forced to nod and accept.\u201cYes, I\u2019ll go and wait for them. All I have to do is this, right?\u201d\u201cYes, you won\u2019t do anything else. Do this job well. It doesn\u2019t matter if you keep your make-up and hair, but you change that ugly, wide and flabby dress. It\u2019s a disgrace to the theater that a kid who works at the Eileen Theater can\u2019t even dress properly.\u201dWhen Maribel disappeared after the words, Julietta grumbled and went into the small room to change her clothes.Sophie, who was guarding the prop room by herself, was worried when she came out wearing the only wide and flabby dress.\u201cIt\u2019s very bold of you to wear the dress Lillian gave you.\u201dIt was a dress worn by an actress who needed everyone\u2019s attention, and despite the fact that she gave her the most simple and ordinary clothes, it was very bold.Julietta studied herself in the mirror at one side of the prop room, thinking that the light lavender-colored dress was incompatible with the red brick wig, and it was a good thing to look ugly. Compared to Lillian, Julietta\u2019s breasts were more voluminous, but the deep chest part seemed ready to burst because of the tension.\u201cI think your breasts are bigger than they were a few months ago. It\u2019s too dangerous to walk in that outfit. Don\u2019t you have any other clothes?\u201dSophie approached and raised the chest part of the dress, trying to cover all the cleavage that was likely to sprout.\u201cNo. Two loose dresses and these are all I usually wear. Is it too much?\u201dShe seemed a little daring, but there was no other way, so Sophie mumbled helplessly, \u201cYou don\u2019t have time, so you can\u2019t add anything else to your chest\u2026let\u2019s just cover it up with this cloth.\u201dFind authorized novels in ReadNovelFull\uff0cfaster updates, better experience\uff0cPlease click www.ReadNovelFull.com for visiting.Sophie took a temporary measure, inserting a cloth into the neckline that could be seen when she lowered her head. A hideous dark red cloth was added to the inside of the bright lavender-colored dress, but Julietta left the prop room and headed for the VIP seats, hypnotizing herself that it coordinated with the brick-colored wig well.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013Prince Killian, the most famous man in Austern, had inherited the Principality of Bertino, and had visited the Eileen Theater to watch the boring opera in return for losing his bet against his cousin, Marquis Rhodius. The actresses were tolerable as they were, but the songs they sang were horrible and Killian looked back at Spencer with a face full of dreadful repulsion.\u201cThey\u2019re staring at me too much. Do the nobles have no pride?\u201dKillian was annoyed by the glances, so he buried himself deep in his chair and ordered the curtain to be lowered until the opening. Spencer, who was impressed by Killian\u2019s glossy black hair and drowsy, silvery eyes, made invidious remarks.\u201cThat\u2019s why you should show your good looks here and there. Since you confine yourself to home, people are anxious.\u201dWhen the curtain was lowered and their eyes were blocked, Killian sighed with satisfaction, and ordered someone to bring his favorite wine. Killian warned Spencer, who had casually watched his servant order the kind of wine to the maid who had been waiting at the door.\u201cBut you don\u2019t want me to see it through, do you? I\u2019ve lost a bet, but that\u2019s too much of a demand.\u201d\u201cYou are here to meet Moira. I don\u2019t know when it will change, but she is still my official lover.\u201dSpencer called his servant when Killian pretended not to hear him.\u201cJeff, when Bill brings a bouquet of flowers to Lillian, go with him and give one to Moira, too. There should be a spare bouquet of flowers in the carriage. If not, go buy it,\u201d Spencer said, gesturing toward his servant.Despite Killian\u2019s cold words, Spencer urged Jeff again.\u201dWhy are you doing something so useless? Jeff, stop it.\u201d\u201cBefore your master\u2019s rumor spreads worse, bring her a bouquet of flowers, as it looks good. If a lover comes to the theater and leaves without looking at her face or leaving a gift, that\u2019s a thing to be criticized. No matter how much you think of her as a high-end whore, it doesn\u2019t look good, so do as I tell you.\u201dWhen Killian closed his mouth at Spencer\u2019s prickly remarks, Jeff went out with Spencer\u2019s servant in a hurry.While Jeff was away, Julietta returned to the guesthouse with the wine ordered by the rumored Prince Bertino.While Jeff was away, Julietta returned to the guesthouse with the wine ordered by the rumored Prince Bertino. She opened a heavy door engraved with colorful intaglio, walked in, and looked for the servant with the unpleasant eyes who he had been glancing at since then on. But she couldn\u2019t see the servant who should be waiting by the door.\u201cBring it here.\u201dJulietta stood at the entrance of the box seat in dismay, and heard a cool voice from the front. She hesitated for a moment at the sudden command, since she had never attended to the noblemen. However, she could not ignore the order given by the highborn man.Julietta looked down at the wine bottle anxiously for a moment and hurried over to him. She was anxious she would hear him tell her to stop dawdling, but she grasped the cap of a bottle of wine in her hand. However, the cap, which seemed to only need a light pull, was immobile, and she was embarrassed by the unexpected difficulty.The thought of pouring wine and stepping down quickly before she was given an impetuous order at having two men of immense status wait dominated her mind. In a hurry, she put the bottle of wine between her thighs, whether or not the two men were watching, and pulled the cork with all her strength.Pong.The effort was good enough to pull the plug out, but the excess force sent the wine bottle flying over the knee of the Prince next to her.\u201cNo!\u201d Maribel\u2019s voice echoed in her mind, that a fire moth might die on the spot. If other women could die of a physical attack on the Prince, who loved sex, she could be beheaded for her attack with a bottle of wine.\u201cYour, Your Highness, forgive\u2026 I\u2019ll wipe it off for you in a hurry.\u201dAs she hurried up to the Prince, whose jacket and pants were covered in red wine, she wiped at it with the hem of her dress, and pulled out a piece of cloth stuck in the front of her chest when her skirt became so wet that she could no longer soak up any more. Julietta wiped the Prince\u2019s jacket hard with a red cloth extracted from it, and lifted her head gently to get a grip on the atmosphere.She spilled wine on the Prince, who was not an ordinary member of the Royal Family, but was second in line to the throne, and even her hands shook at the thought of being dragged out immediately.Contrary to what she thought, however, the expressionless Prince sat quietly, leaving himself in her hands. Gaining courage by his look, Julietta quickly asked for forgiveness. \u201cYour Highness, please show me mercy. I did my best to clean it, but I can\u2019t help it if it\u2019s wet\u2026\u201dJulietta grumbled at the shit dog Manny inside and begged and pleaded as if her life depended on it, in the hope of living once.\u2018I have to abandon self-respect here.\u2019It was strange to glance at the Prince in a trembling voice and repeat her apology once again.The Prince, who should be angry like a fire, or calling for his servant because he had to change his clothes because he was wet, or calling on the owner of the theater to take responsibility for the incident, was calm. He sat at an angle, staring at one place, his chin resting on his right hand with his elbow supported by an armrest, and did not lose his graceful form in the slightest.When Julietta looked at what he was looking at, she followed his eyes\u2026 and the destination was her own chest. The Prince\u2019s well-combed eyebrows rose as Julietta quickly retreated due to her unconscious defensive instincts, crossed her arms, and blocked the view of her chest.\u201cIt\u2019s too late to cover up now.\u201dWhen Julietta\u2019s face turned red, unable to get angry because of her sin, the Prince turned to Spencer. \u201cDid you see it? The light wasn\u2019t as bright as I thought it would be, so I wonder if you could see it there.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I need to change my clothes.\u201dKillian winked at Spencer, who was staring at him in the face. Spencer stood up, pushed by Killian, stared at the maid who was trembling in the corner, shrugged, and went out the door.Julietta, who was left alone with the Prince in the curtained VIP seat, stepped back one more step, faltering uneasily.\u201cAren\u2019t you wondering about what I saw?\u201d the Prince asked, leaning sideways as if he cared nothing about his wet clothes.Julietta took another step back, shaking her head, if she refused to think about what he saw except her chest.\u201d The Prince raised one arm and signaled for her to stop.\u201cI\u2019ll forgive you for showing me something good in return for the wine. But if you walk around the theater like that, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be as lucky as this time. Wait until Jeff comes back.\u201dAt the word of forgiveness in the low, sexy voice of the Prince, Julietta bowed to her belly by ninety degrees, and expressed her thanks to him.\u201cAre you seducing me? Did I get your signal wrong?\u201dWhen she saw the Prince who slowly lick his lower lip with his tongue, and speak with his lowered voice and profound affection, she realized why he was the most popular guy in Austern. Julietta shook her head so hard that she felt numb, putting the wet red cloth she had in her hand back on her chest.\u201cNo, Your Highness. I am ignorant of not knowing what a signal is. I just wanted to thank you for your forgiveness. I know better than anyone else in the theater, so can I leave now?\u201dKillian looked carefully at the maid, who had a rough, tough head of brick-red hair and a dull brown face.His eyes glowed, looking at her skin, which might be smooth above all else, green eyes shining like jewels in her slim face, and her lovely, bloodless little lips.Moreover, the red cloth hastily inserted into the chest cavity was drenched with wine on the front of the thin dress, creating a more compelling spectacle.Unlike her young and innocent looks, she had a pretty deep chest line that only actresses usually had. The best breast he had ever seen seemed to have sprung up.Furthermore, the spectacle, which was slightly visible when she leaned down, made the viewer feel quite anxious.Killian, who had no taste so far, thought he might have been attracted to this and laughed out loud. He thought he lacked human emotions, but he felt quite charmed by the woman in front of him, who was terrified and quivering.Find authorized novels in ReadNovelFull\uff0cfaster updates, better experience\uff0cPlease click www.ReadNovelFull.com for visiting.But the Prince, who had never taken a woman by force, gave up the thought of pretending that the maid had sent him a signal and waved her away before changing his mind.When the light purple dress that had shaken his mind, disappeared before his eyes, the Prince clicked his tongue. He thought he would go without meeting Moira in a bother, but today he had no choice but to take her out and enjoy the night. Then he looked down at his wet clothes, which he had forgotten for a moment.Just as Spencer brought Jeff in, Killian thought for a moment and opened his mouth. \u201cI\u2019d rather go back than change my clothes. Jeff, tell Moira to come to Harrods Street later. Spencer, are you going to stay any longer?\u201dEventually, Spencer followed his cousin, who stood up to go back even before the opera began.\u201cNo. What kind of fun would it be without you?\u201d I also have to go back now.\u201dAs the two exited the VIP box before the opening, the theater once again became noisy. Regardless, Julietta, who had safely returned to her small room next to the prop room, choosing only the dark places in the theater, sat on the floor and caught her breath.\u201cWhew, I almost killed myself. Even so, he looked very desirable.\u201dThat handsome young man overflowing with sexual attraction was the fifth son of the current Emperor and the only son of the second Queen, Irene Elizabeth Bertino Austern. Killian, who had inherited the Principality of Bertino from his maternal grandfather, was also the most beloved Prince of Claudio, the current Emperor, for his outstanding appearance, sword skills, and extraordinary intelligence.The Principality of Bertino he inherited was a small country between the Austern Empire and the Vicern Empire, famous for its rich fertile territory and natural resources. Killian, who had inherited Bertino Business Group run by his maternal grandfather, was recognized for his business talent by raising it into a big business group in only five years.Killian, who had inherited Bertino Business Group run by his maternal grandfather, was recognized for his business talent by raising it into a big business group in only five years.Killian, known as the richest man on the continent at the age of twenty-three, behaved as if he were not interested in politics at all. However, he was also the most closely watched and checked in Austern, where there was no direct descendant from the queen and the seat of the Crown Prince was still vacant.As such, he was the subject of envy and jealousy from everyone.The fireflies, who wanted to be the sexual partner of someone with wealth, appearance, title of nobility, and all these things, used to rush to him, setting themselves on fire, with the illusion that they could take the official position themselves, even though they knew that the position would be kept only a few months.Julietta, who had heard Bertino and Bertino so much that a scab formed over her ears, saw him today and truly understood why they were making such a fuss. But she didn\u2019t want to be a firefly. Julietta sighed with relief that she had survived the crime of death today.\u201cI\u2019m glad the owner of the mansion, which I\u2019ll be working for next week, is a pretty good man. By the way, it\u2019s not true what I thought earlier. The chest line was so deep that it attracted his attention.\u201dWith a desire to deny the reality, Julietta, who opened the door of her small room, hurriedly approached the mirror in the corner after confirming that no one was in the prop room.\u201cOh, my God. What the hell is this?\u201dWhether she was embarrassed or excited, her brown face was as bright as it could be, and the stained breast, with the metum which had been hastily applied to match the color of her face, was lustrous and swollen ready to burst. Moreover, because she had hurriedly inserted a wine-soaked cloth into her blouse, the front of the dress was soaked to the skin, revealing the outline of the contents within.She breathed a despairing sigh, but still thought it was a good thing that she didn\u2019t show him her naked body. But as soon as she pulled out a piece of uncomfortable cloth, she was shocked to the point where she wanted to faint.When the red cloth disappeared, she didn\u2019t know if the front of the dress had fallen or had been pulled down to clean the wine, but they were shouting out their presence as if the important things that should be hidden quietly were being revealed to all. In addition, a small black dot in the middle of the breastbone became more and more visible on her white skin, prompting Julietta to stamp her feet.\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve spent all my life\u2019s fortune coming back safely after this. This incident would be enough for me to kick a quilt to death.\u201dJulietta, red with shame and embarrassment, hurried into the back room.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u201cYour Highness, you\u2019re even greater today. This Moira was so ecstatic that my whole body melted away.\u201dMoira, once again smitten with Killian, was more passionate than usual, muttering half in rapture. A man like this would be nice even if he were poor, but he was still a Prince. He was also a Prince with the right to succeed the throne.Moira thought she was really in love and even more anxious to catch a man with a gesture. Despite such an effort, as Killian, who went down from her, tried to get out of bed immediately as usual, Moira hurriedly grabbed his firm arm.\u201cYour Highness, I don\u2019t want to leave your side right after such a wonderful night.

Jeff!\u201dJeff, who was waiting outside, hurried into the room at his call. Moira screamed and hid in the sheets.\u201cIs this how you train the maid? Look at her! Get Albert now. This is not once or twice. What the hell is going on here?\u201dWith Killian\u2019s angry attitude, Jeff hurried and glared at the maid, who did not know what to do.She must have not heard his order, as she was deeply attracted to the Prince. As it was not repeated again, Jeff ran to call the butler. He sighed deeply, thinking that his master\u2019s mood would hit the bottom again today.\u2014\u2014\u201cAlbert, how long do I have to call you for this?\u201dAfter Jeff hurried to bring in Sir Albert Michel Manfredo, the butler and the grand chamberlain of Prince Killian, and a member of the family of Baron Manfredo, the Prince\u2019s bedroom was fortunately drawn clean.No matter how passionately he loved a woman in bed, all that went by when the moment of obsession passed. His cool, knife-like nature often made his women lose their understanding and whine. That was why the Prince changed his lover from time to time, even though his taste for women was not very different.For the Prince, there was only one condition for his lover: not to bother him. Today\u2019s incident was a great one for the nature of the Prince, who put silence above any external beauty.Killian\u2019s mood fell to the floor, irritated by a thirst he didn\u2019t satisfy even if he made love with a woman longer than usual. The woman\u2019s brick-colored, rough hair seemed to overlap the reddish-brown hair of a woman holding him in bed. Just as the maid who kept the bedroom provoked his mood, his irritation turned into anger and stabbed the sky.Albert, who had been called before the Prince, began to suggest this and that way to soothe his master\u2019s feelings, wiping away sweat that was not even there.\u201cYour Highness, I can\u2019t do anything with my own manpower. If a maid is fascinated by you, it\u2019s because she has eyes to see. So why don\u2019t you take this opportunity to ask a male servant to wait on you?\u201d\u201cEven though he is a servant, do you dare to let another man see the naked body of the woman in my bedroom?\u201dAlbert barely kept his mouth shut, trying to mutter, and offered a different opinion for the Prince who had no affection for women, but was strangely stubborn, \u201cThen why don\u2019t you go to the woman\u2019s bedroom? Then you don\u2019t have to suffer this kind of inconvenience. You don\u2019t have to try to get rid of a woman who doesn\u2019t want to leave. All the other Princes are doing that\u2026\u201d\u201cHow can I know what\u2019s in those women\u2019s rooms and go to them?\u201dAlbert muttered inwardly, thinking of his political opponents, who were looking for the most vulnerable time for the Prince. \u2018No, I know. I feel heavy with worries and do this.\u2019\u201cThen, Your Highness, I hear there are men in the southern island country who can\u2019t serve as men. They work in the care of women of higher status. Why don\u2019t you try to find one?\u201d Albert carefully told his master what Spencer had told him the last time he had visited.\u201cDoes that mean that it is a man who manages a woman of the royal family in the country? You\u2019re saying he\u2019s a man, anyway. I need only a good working maid. Is it that hard?\u201dIn Killian\u2019s cold manner of questioning his ability, Albert lowered his tail and obeyed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Your Highness. I\u2019ll take responsibility and find the perfect maid.\u201dExactly a week after the incident that she wanted to erase forever from her mind, Julietta arrived at Harrods Street, where she and her mother had lived under the protection of Marquis Anais.Julietta, who paid the cost of a carriage ride with a little money Amelie and Sophie had given her, stood at the magnificent iron gate guarded by knights in dark gray armor and looked at the mansion. The mansion, decorated in dark purple, the color of the family of Bertino, and silver and black, the color of Prince Killian, was so powerful that it broke her spirits at the entrance.Julietta recalled what had happened a few days ago, lifting the thick iron glasses hanging on her small face.\u2014\u2014The day after Prince Bertino went to the theater, Lillian visited Julieta.\u201cJulie, I heard something big happened yesterday?\u201dWhen asked yesterday about pouring wine on the noble Prince, Julietta sighed and said in a low voice, \u201cDoes the head of the troupe know?\u201d\u201cFortunately, she doesn\u2019t. I heard it from Marquis Rhodius yesterday. I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re alright, without any problems.\u201dLillian swept up her dark chestnut hair, consoling the downcast girl in front of her. She was the daughter of Stella, who had taken care of her like an older sister after she had just come up from the countryside. She became a trainee at Eileen Theater, where she had learned to sing and dance.When Stella had fallen in love with Marquis Anais and retired to a mansion, Lillian had been as happy as if it was herself. When Stella had been kicked out overnight and returned to the theater with her young daughter and died of illness less than a year ago, she had felt gloomy, as she had looked forward to her future.Lillian, who turned twenty-eight this year, was slowly taking over the prima donna position at Eileen Theater and preparing to return to the countryside. Her relationship with Marquis Rhodius would end the moment she retired from the theater. Like other actresses, she didn\u2019t want to die a shabby death while playing the toy of a nobleman.She felt more sorry for Julietta than others, who had suddenly become a scoundrel after living in luxury under the protection of the Marquis, even though she was a bastard. Lillian, who wanted to be someone the young girl could rely on while she still had her popularity and strength as an actress, said sincerely, \u201cJulie, if anything happens, make sure you contact me. Can you promise me you won\u2019t decide everything by yourself or jump into something dangerous? I know you\u2019re a very brave and self-reliant child, but just remember you\u2019re not alone.\u201dJulie smiled at Lillian\u2019s friendly brown eyes. \u201cThank you for taking care of me. I was very happy to have a place to visit when I was having a hard time. I really appreciate it.\u201d\u201cI want to give you a present as a commemoration of getting a new job out of the theater. Is there anything you want to have?\u201dWhen Lillian asked, Julietta hesitated for a moment before carefully saying, \u201cI want glasses, not the expensive ones worn by aristocrats, but rather the big, thick ones worn by Morgan, the manager of the Eileen Theater.\u201d\u201cGlasses? Why all of a sudden?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure I won\u2019t run into the Prince when I go in as a cleaning maid, but I\u2019m just trying to be careful if he recognizes me by any possibility. He forgave me yesterday, but I\u2019m afraid he\u2019ll get angry when he sees my face.\u201dIn order to prevent anxiety in advance, Julietta desperately needed heavy glasses to hide her face.\u201cOh, it\u2019s Bertino mansion where you will work as a maid,\u201d Lillian nodded and added again, \u201cYes, I\u2019ll find out and order it for you. Actually, I want to find another place for you to work, but I\u2019m running out of time. I feel uneasy I can get you anywhere. Still, I hope you won\u2019t have any problems, as you have a recommendation letter from Marquis Rhodius.\u201d\u2014\u2014-Recalling Lillian\u2019s affectionate words, Julietta was once again determined, and extended a letter of recommendation to the gatekeeper, avoiding the harsh eyes of the knights. The gatekeeper looked at the letter of recommendation with suspicious eyes and soon opened the door, guiding her to the back door used by the servants and maids.\u201cMy God, no matter how it is the introduction of Marquis Rhodius, how fat and ugly a maid to work in the Prince\u2019s mansion is! This is undermining the dignity of His Highness.\u201dA head maid, Johanna, looked at Julieta and frowned deeply.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Bertino Mansion on Harrods Street, Part IITranslator: KhanEditor: AelryinthKillian\u2019s cousin, Marquis Rhodius, was the son of the Emperor\u2019s sister, Princess Tanisia. Although the line of succession to the throne was far below that of the Emperor\u2019s sons, he was a royal family member. Having brought such a letter of introduction, she couldn\u2019t send her back even if she had a very unseemly appearance.Johanna sighed and looked at the girl before her again. Tall at 165 centimeters, she had broad shoulders, a thick waistline that looks as if it can\u2019t be covered by both arms, fluffy hips, and stiff, thick, brick-colored hair.The higher the nobleman, the more important the appearance of a maid. She was a maid meant to work in the Prince\u2019s mansion, nowhere else. Johanna looked her with hawk\u2019s eyes and gave up the search.Her face was strangely small compared to her large body, and her complexion was so dark that she seemed to be sick, and even more earthy because of her red hair.Besides, those thick glasses she wore! The heavy-looking glasses, which seemed to make her nose sink, made it impossible to guess what color and shape her eyes were.Johanna spoke to the girl with an unsavory face, \u201cCan you work with that dull body? Take care of the guest room on the first floor, the hallway of the dwelling places of the servants and maids, and the dining area. You should clean up as carefully as you can to make sure that you don\u2019t get noticed by the guests and His Highness. Do you understand?\u201dJulieta\u2019s eyes put on a prim air, as Johanna held her forehead and spoke grudgingly. \u201cYes, head maid.\u201dBut as she replied politely, the head maid continued, \u201cYour room is one of the maids\u2019 quarters on the fourth floor, right next to the stairs. Go up, leave your luggage and come down. I have to prepare clothes fit for you, so you just wear your clothes and work until your uniform is ready.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Julietta bowed to her with good manners once again and climbed up to the fourth floor using the stairs behind her, which were available to the maids.The room was not shown her by anyone, but she knew it right away. After she opened the door right next to the stairs and entered, she saw a single bed and a single room with a wooden box, with only a small table and belongings.The small but clean room left Julietta unable to hide her joy. She was very happy to have her own space with windows and the sun coming in, as she had been living in a small room next to the theater\u2019s prop room.\u2018Yes, I can gradually increase my quality of life. After paying off my debt to Maribel, I will raise enough money to open my own shop. But first, I am going to have to deal with the useless ability that a poop dog Manny gave me.\u2019Julietta sat down carefully on the bed, took out a cheap mirror of only palm size from her bag and carefully checked to see if her makeup had been erased.An unsightly dull brown face with stiff, rough-looking brick-colored wig and thicker-than-usual metum fruit juice\u2026 Her eyebrows were twice as thick as her real ones, and her lips were painted in a dull color to make her look like a sick person, and hard to see. But this ugly face was a safety device that protected herself and others.Julietta had once thought of breaking her disguise. She had felt sorry that she had to hide such a pretty figure with a disguise, so she had removed her make-up and taken off her wig in the prop room for a while.Find authorized novels in ReadNovelFull\uff0cfaster updates, better experience\uff0cPlease click www.ReadNovelFull.com for visiting.When Amelia and Sophie saw this and started talking, Julieta decided to wear makeup again. They said she would look prettier than most of the actresses in the theater, admiring her colorful blonde hair, white skin and green eyes. Startled, Julietta immediately donned a wig again!Since then, she had been angry at the idea that she could never remove her disguise until she solved the curse-like ability Manny had given her, but she had decided to take it easy, thinking the disguise might be a shield to protect her.Julietta, feeling satisfied, arranged her few belongings in a wooden box and went down to the first floor.\u201cWhat is it? Is she a new maid? Oh, my God, look at her.\u201dAs soon as she was introduced to the people she would work with, she heard giggles and was pointed out for her appearance. Anyway, whether in the previous life or here, it seemed like looks were the biggest problem of mankind.\u201cI\u2019ve never seen such an ugly, fat girl. Look at her hair. I can cut it and use it as a broom.\u201d\u201cLook at that skin color. What did she do to make her skin color like that? Her hands are white, but what\u2019s wrong with her face? Hey, are you sick? It\u2019s not contagious, is it? I\u2019m talking about the disease that makes them all ugly.\u201dYelping at her, they were all in a fuss.Julietta pouted at the people who were laughing at her face.\u2018If Manny had given me beauty control, I would have made them all ugly and opened the era of equality for humanity.\u2019Maids who were the same age as her ignored good manners and kept teasing Julietta, but no one stopped them. The head maid pretended not to hear and began ordering the maids to do what they had to right away.\u201cThe Prince will stop by tomorrow, so clean the first-floor hall and help with the kitchen work. If the furniture has any dust on it, you\u2019ll have to do it again all night, so do it carefully from the beginning. Now, go to your assigned areas and get to work in a hurry. Ali, please clean the room again for Lady Moira. I\u2019m not going to let her complain like before.\u201dThe head maid pretended not to hear and began ordering the maids to do what they had to right away.\u201cThe Prince will stop by tomorrow, so clean the first-floor hall and help with the kitchen work.

Ali, please clean the room again for Lady Moira. I\u2019m not going to let her complain like before.\u201dAt Johanna\u2019s words, the gray-haired maid who was laughing at Julieta grumbled. \u201cThe Lady was weird. She got kicked out by the Prince and vented her anger on me. Johanna, you know that.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s our job to deal with it before we get a complaint from our superior. Don\u2019t say anything, just clean it up again. You changed the sheets to red ones, right?\u201d Ignoring the maid\u2019s complaint, Johanna once again asked strictly.Ali answered, \u201cYes. That\u2019s why I ordered new ones, and I had to change them. His Highness won\u2019t need to go to that room anyway, but I don\u2019t know why she bites the dust asking me to change the sheets to red ones.\u201d\u201cQuiet. Everyone, split up quickly; hurry up and finish your work.\u201dAs the head maid clapped her hands and urged everyone, the maids, who had been complaining, scattered.People went to their places and Julietta stood there in the empty hall, not knowing where to go. Johanna looked at her disapprovingly and ordered her to follow. \u201cYou follow me here. I\u2019ll tell you where to work starting today.\u201dJulietta, having a very straight posture for her dull body, followed the head maid and headed to the back of the first floor. She was introduced to Rowena, the maid in charge of cleaning. Rowena, whose hair had turned grey in her fifties, also frowned at Julietta\u2019s dull body.\u201cI don\u2019t know if she can do right what she is ordered.\u201dRowena\u2019s discontented voice made Johanna look back at Julietta. \u201cI\u2019ll give you a daily quota. You\u2019ll not rest until you\u2019re done with it, so you\u2019ll have to be diligent. If you move that much, you\u2019ll lose that big belly.\u201dJulietta tried to say something in an instant rage, as she had heard all kinds of insults from the moment she entered the house, but barely managed to endure and not say a word. She wrote the letter \u2018patience\u2019 in ten times and answered politely, vowing not to get stung by their comments, \u201cYes. I\u2019ll work hard.

Dust off the furniture every day, change the sheets every other day, remove the dust from the carpet every three days\u2026\u201dJulietta was at a loss to remember the tasks which were pouring out endlessly.\u2018I don\u2019t know if I can memorize it all. When I get paid, I will buy a pen first.\u2019Julietta entered the room pointed out by the maid. When Julietta entered the room she thought was empty, a pretty maid with gray hair and black eyes asked, \u201cAre you the new maid?\u201d\u201cYes. I\u2019m working starting today. My name is Julietta.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m Anna. I\u2019m supposed to be in charge of the eastern side starting today. Let\u2019s get along well.\u201dA week ago, Anna, who had been taken on bedroom duty at the instruction of the mansion\u2019s owner, Prince Bertino, had been mesmerized by a sexier than usual atmosphere and his naked appearance, but had missed the order the Prince had given her. She had incurred the anger of the Prince, who really disliked his orders not being obeyed instantly, being forced to repeat the words he had uttered once, had been scolded by Sir Albert, and demoted to a cleaning maid.Anna, who had been snobbish about being different from ordinary maids, was very angry at the fact that she became a cleaning maid. Seeing her discontented attitude, the butler told her to leave the mansion if she didn\u2019t like being a cleaning maid.Having received a week\u2019s grace period, she was seriously concerned about finding another job, but could not quit, since this job would allow her to see the Prince occasionally. Many of the Prince\u2019s women were far worse looking than her, so she had no doubt that one day she would have a chance.According to information obtained by enticing Jeff, the Prince\u2019s servant, the Prince never chose a woman first, he dismissed any annoying woman who thought she was special after a few months, and at that time a lucky one among the women around him was given a chance.Anna was looking for a chance, thinking she would be able to get her hands on him for just a few months. Those months could be years if she didn\u2019t bother the Prince and did nothing he hated. But she had missed a good opportunity after a brief mistake yesterday.Anna continuously regretted her mistake. She decided to win the favor of the head maid and the butler by working hard for the time being, and become a maid who could enter and leave the Prince\u2019s bedroom again.However, a new maid with the worst appearance came in, looking dumb. At the moment her mind was shaken again, because she didn\u2019t want to do the cleaning she was not used to.With those looks, no one in the mansion would want to deal with her, so a little bit of charm would make the new maid her own. Thinking that, Anna smiled sweetly at her new maid.Julietta felt relieved at the first friendly gesture she received after she had arrived at the mansion. Moved by the little kindness, she greeted Anna with a hearty smile and bowed to her. \u201cYes, I have a favor to ask of you.\u201d\u2014\u2014Julietta woke up the next morning after a hectic day, and pondered over what had happened yesterday before going down to the first floor to work.She had been delighted thinking \u2018An appearance is not all about for life\u2019 when the pretty maid Anna had treated her kindly, unlike anyone else. But there was a different motive for her behavior and unprovoked kindness.Anna, who had used to be affectionate with her soft-spoken voice, had said she was from the family of the Baron and a maid who had served the Prince directly until a week ago. She said there had been a misunderstanding for a while and now she was working as a cleaning maid, but she would go back to being a maid for the Prince, and if Julietta was good to her, her future would be easier.The reason she had said such a thing was to pass on what she had to do in the end.Yesterday, Julietta had to clean the empty rooms and community areas used by the servants and maids late into the night after dinner at Anna\u2019s orders, who was next to her and barely moved her hands. Although she had felt bloated, Julietta, who did not want to make an enemy on the first day and didn\u2019t want her future to be like that, had done as she had been told.Thinking that the same thing was going to happen again today, she mumbled, adding a fluffy dress on top of her heavy underwear, \u201cWhat should I do if I have to make a move?\u201dBut she couldn\u2019t think of any particular methods, so she sighed and headed downstairs.\u201cJulietta, have you never met the Prince?\u201d asked Anna, sitting cross-legged beside Julietta, who was sweeping and wiping to the extent her back would break, humming a song and making a stupid expression.\u201cNo, I have not.\u201d To Julietta, determined to bury the past incident deep in her mind, Prince Bertino was a man she had never met.\u201cI suppose a girl like you could not meet His Highness. I\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t be able to see him again today. I heard the head maid said you should not be seen to others, right?\u201dAnna had just begun to treat Julietta recklessly, leaving behind the pretentious kindness.\u201cCorrect.\u201d\u201cWhat a pity. I\u2019m so sorry to hear that; one of the greatest pleasures of the maids who work here is that they can see him up close.\u201d\u201cThank you for your attention. But I\u2019m in a situation where the cleaning I have to finish today is more important than the painting\u2019s rice cake, the Prince.\u201dJulietta, who had carved the letter \u2018patience\u2019 inside after yesterday and today, was thinking \u2018Let\u2019s not deal with her but stay calm,\u2019 but couldn\u2019t stand Anna, who kept fiddling with her side.\u201cPicture rice cake? What does that have to do with His Highness?\u201dWhen Anna, who didn\u2019t know what it meant, opened her eyes wide and asked again, Julieta replied with a look of contempt, \u201cIf you didn\u2019t understand, that\u2019s fine. And if you\u2019re going to continue not working today, I\u2019ll tell the head maid. I am busy doing what I\u2019m assigned to, and I have no mind to do the work of two.\u201dThe sudden change in Julietta\u2019s attitude, who had been working as she had just been told, made Anna gape at her. \u201cHey, didn\u2019t you hear who I was yesterday? I\u2019m not the kind of person to clean up. If I become the maid of the Prince again later, I can get you to work under me. Then you can see the Prince very close.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t need to. You don\u2019t have to give me that chance, so start cleaning now, or I\u2019ll go and tell the head maid right away.\u201dWhen cleaning the assigned places, they were supposed to clean it in pairs. Anna, who was demoted to a cleaning maid, and Julietta, who had just joined, were paired up to replace bed sheets and clean furniture dust, while Julietta was in charge of carpets and floor cleaning. However, when Anna handed over the two maid\u2019s share of work to her yesterday, she exploded.\u2018What\u2019s the difference if I add one more person as an enemy when I am surrounded by enemies on all sides? Now I don\u2019t care what will happen.\u2019Julietta gave the hand mop she was holding to Anna whose mouth was open in embarrassment. She looked back and threatened her again, dragging her carpet around and not letting her out of the room.\u201cMake sure you clean it until I get back. I did your job yesterday, so I want you to finish cleaning the floors assigned to me today.\u201dAnna then had to continue the cleaning job she was unhappy with, as she could not be lazy after Julietta\u2019s threats. After she managed to finish her endless cleaning, she was furious and grunted, \u2018Though only a beginner, you threaten me! I can\u2019t stay like this forever.\u2019Find authorized novels in ReadNovelFull\uff0cfaster updates, better experience\uff0cPlease click www.ReadNovelFull.com for visiting.She had thought she could easily make it through the maid job as Julietta had come in as someone of little account, until she went back as a maid of the Prince. But it felt like she\u2019d been beaten in the back, and now she wanted to figure out a way to kick the ugly girl out.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Have you eaten dinner yet?\u201dThere was still half an hour left until the meal time, and as she left the dining area, Anna asked about Nicole\u2019s appearance.\u201cThe Prince is coming today. I\u2019ll get ready.\u201dAnna and Nicole had taken turns attending the Prince\u2019s bedroom, but it had apparently led to Nicole\u2019s full-time job as a maid of the Prince, as Anna had been demoted to a cleaning maid. Therefore, Anna\u2019s expression was tinged by jealousy, for she was sorry for the job she had lost.\u201cThat\u2019s great for you. Keep your head straight.

I saw her on the day she entered the mansion. Whew, I don\u2019t know what she is going to do with that big body. Even if she brought a letter of recommendation, the head maid is too soft-hearted.

Did you let that happen? I\u2019ll talk to the head maid right now and get her fired.\u201dAt Nicole\u2019s anger, Anna pretended to be generous and stopped her.\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anywhere else to go. It\u2019s better if I just do it all. Still, I told her I\u2019d report to the head maid if she didn\u2019t continue to work, leaving it all to me like that, but she was forced to do it. But I\u2019m having a hard time because I work so much more.\u201d\u201cOh, poor girl! It must have been hard for you. So were you thinking about doing?\u201d\u201cYes. I won\u2019t be pleased if I talk to the head maid in person, but I feel a little unfair about letting her go.\u201dAt Anna\u2019s words, Nicole smiled an ugly smile. \u201cHow about this? Lady Moira is coming today. I am supposed to serve tea today, but let\u2019s just have her run the errand instead of me. The head maid told her not to be seen by the guests, and if the head maid finds out that she went to the guest room with tea, she might kick her out. Even if she\u2019s not kicked out, I\u2019m glad she has to deal with all Moira\u2019s nerves, and you\u2019ll be pleased to put her through the trouble. It\u2019s good for both of us.\u201d\u201cNichol, how did you end up thinking of that? It\u2019s a really good idea.\u201dThe two immediately began exchanging opinions with each other.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\u201cTake this to Lady Moira\u2019s bedroom on the first floor.\u201dAnna, who was waiting for Julietta to return to her quarters after a tiring day\u2019s work, pulled out the tea she was carrying.\u201cI was told not to be seen by guests or the master.\u201dWhen Julietta took the teacup in an unguarded moment, Anna said indifferently, \u201cIt\u2019s because there is no one who has no job right now. Lady Moira won\u2019t mind who\u2019s coming anyway, so get it to her. Hand over the tea and make sure she drinks it all.\u201d\u201cDo I even have to check on her drinking?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s an incredibly expensive potion in the tea that prevents pregnancy. She doesn\u2019t want to drink it every time we give it to her, so you have to make sure she drinks it all at all costs. You should look at her drinking it yourself, collect the teacup, and return.\u201dShe must be retaliating for her defiance a few days ago, but there was no evidence to be particularly cross. Julietta looked into the deep rosy, fragrant tea, and murmured gruesomely to herself, who had been abandoned as a bastard, \u201cYes, contraception is very important.\u201d\u2014\u2014The lover\u2019s room of the Prince was the innermost of the guest rooms on the first floor. Just as if it were the place for any exile, Julietta managed to find the room in the corner, knocked on the heavy door, and cautiously stepped inside.\u201cLady, I\u2019ve got your tea.\u201dMoira, who was angry after she was kicked out of the Prince\u2019s room as soon as the affair ended today, frowned at the ugly maid.\u201cWho are you, this is the first I\u2019ve seen you?\u201d\u201cMy name is Julietta; I have been working in this mansion starting some time ago.\u201dMoira, whose irritation had soared to the top of her head, began shouting wildly, \u201cDo they dare let you bring my tea even if you are a beginner? Huh!\u201dAt the deafening cry, Julietta quickly asked for forgiveness. It was clear that she would be in trouble if she made a fuss this night.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I was so moved by Lady Moira playing Marshall in \u2018Lady Donatera\u2019 that I wanted to see your face in person, so I insisted on waiting for you. Forgive me.\u201dMoira, who was raving with fury, paused at the sight of the maid lowering her head. \u201cMarshall? How did a maid like you see the play?\u201dAt the lowered voice, Julietta quickly gathered her hands and looked at Moira with eager eyes.\u201cWhen I was young, I was left at the Eileen Theater and did chores in the prop room until two weeks ago. I went back and forth and became a fan of yours.\u201dAs she had never cursed her with excitement like Amelie and Sophie, because she had no sense of skill or ability except for her good-looking face, Julietta played to her vanity.\u201cReally? I don\u2019t remember a girl like you, because I just got into the theater. You\u2019re a fan of mine, so I\u2019ll forgive you this time. But in this mansion, they bring me tea after I leave the room of His Highness. Tell me honestly what\u2019s in it.\u201dMoira had a rough idea of what the tea was, but was well aware that if she refused, she would not be able to meet the Prince again. So, she had to drink as much as she could, but today she started to think that she could get by without drinking it, thanks to the easy maid.\u201cThey said it\u2019s a healthy, expensive tea to help your stamina to deal with the Prince. I was warned many times that I should be careful not to spill a drop.\u201dWhen Julietta put the teacup down carefully on the table, Moira glared at her, thinking that this ugly maid was deliberately pretending not to know.\u201cReally? It\u2019s an expensive tea that\u2019s good for me? Then you drink it. I\u2019ll make a special concession for you.\u201dMoira, who had followed Lillian and had been looking for a chance, had been able to take the position of the Prince\u2019s lover. From the day of the jubilation to this day, she had visited this famous Bertino mansion on Harrods Street about five times in total.As the meetings continued, Moira fell for the Prince without any hesitation. The Prince, who was handsome and rich, was as good at sex as it was rumored. She had slept with numerous men, whether it was by her own will or others, but she had never been as satisfied with both her body and mind as she was now.She was agonizing over and over how to stay with the Prince longer. Everything would be easy if she had a child of the Prince, but that red tea was placed in front of her every day after the affair, so such a hope would not happen.Until now, she had been forced to drink with the help of the head maid or a direct maid of the Prince, but today it was different.\u2018I\u2019ll never drink that tea, even if I have to torture this young maid.\u2019\u201cIs it really okay for me to drink? I heard it\u2019s very expensive tea. Thank you.\u201dContrary to her idea, however, she was startled by the sight of the maid who picked up the cup of tea without hesitation. She quickly took the glass out of the maid\u2019s hand because she thought it was a really healthy tea when she saw the maid ready to drink with such a big smile.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Bertino Mansion on Harrods Street, Part VTranslator: KhanEditor: AelryinthLooking at Moira, who was agonizing for a while with a cup of tea in case she misunderstood, Julietta pretended not to know, and said, as if she were sorry for the good medicine, \u201cI\u2019ll tell the head maid frankly that I drank it. When the head maid scolds me, you have to tell her that you told me to drink.\u201dJulieta, who knew it wouldn\u2019t do much harm by drinking a cup of contraceptive tea anyway, was really willing to drink it. However, if she was caught, she\u2019d be kicked out.As she reached out to take the tea away from Moira, who was tilting her head, Moira gulped down the red tea with a sour expression. It would be good if it was to protect her body, and even if it was tea to stop her from getting pregnant, she could not help but drink it because the maid said she would tell the head maid if she didn\u2019t drink it.While drinking tea, Moira gazed at the threatening maid. She was deceived even though she knew better, as she couldn\u2019t leave the Prince\u2019s side.Julietta intentionally made a very regrettable face, looking at Moira who drank it, her expression full of complaints.Looking at the expression on her face, Moira believed this maid truly thought that the tea was healthy.Find authorized novels in ReadNovelFull\uff0cfaster updates, better experience\uff0cPlease click www.ReadNovelFull.com for visiting.When she handed over the empty teacup, Julietta accepted it with absolute politeness. Moira liked Julietta, who treated herself more like a queen than the maids who always looked down on her.\u201cI want you to serve the tea from now on.\u201dJulietta\u2019s face hardened at Moira\u2019s way of speaking, as if she was giving her a big grace. It was because she was annoyed that she was taking on more unnecessary work. However, as she was unable to show her inner thoughts, she immediately bowed her head deeply to express her gratitude and stepped out of the room.Anna, meanwhile, ran to the head maid after ordering Julietta to run an errand.\u201cHead maid, Julietta broke the order and took the tea into Lady Moira\u2019s room.\u201dJohanna was consulting the chef on the Prince\u2019s breakfast menu and looked back at Anna\u2019s words. \u201cWhat are you talking about? I told the girl not to show herself in front of the guests; what\u2019s Nicole doing?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. I saw her go into the Lady\u2019s room and I came to tell you right away. It would be a big problem if the Lady doesn\u2019t drink the tea. I think you should go.\u201d\u201cWhat the hell is wrong with her? No matter how she brought an introductory letter from Marquis Rhodius, I\u2019ll have to kick her out right away.\u201dKnowing that there was a scuffle every time she sent the tea to Moira\u2019s room, Johanna ran nervously down the hall. When she arrived in front of Moira\u2019s room at the innermost part of the hall, she saw Julietta leaving the door.As soon as she saw Julietta, Johanna dragged her out from the front of the door, far away, and flew into a rage. She thought she had failed because she couldn\u2019t have made her drink the tea in this short time.\u201cWho dares to come and go in and out of the Lady\u2019s room? How long have you been in here? You\u2019ve already made fun of my orders. Give me the tea and go upstairs and pack your belongings right away.\u201dAnna laughed at Julietta, her arms folded. Julietta was surprised at the sudden shouting, \u2018How dare you got too cocky, you ugly girl!\u2019She was so relieved that she didn\u2019t have to look at that hideous figure after today.Julietta noticed what had happened when she saw Anna behind the dreadfully pressing Johanna. It was obvious that she had her run the errand for the tea to kick her out.Julietta politely held out the empty teacup to Johanna, who was staring at her, to soothe her anger by letting her know that she had completed her mission. Johanna stopped her anger after looking at the clean teacup, where not a drop remained, and asked, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me, did the Lady drink all of it?\u201d\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201dAnna checked the teacup over Johanna\u2019s shoulder and quickly stepped in. \u201cIt can\u2019t be that way. Head maid, you know that. It takes a while to get her to drink a cup of tea. I\u2019m sure she drank it or threw it away because she was afraid of getting scolded.\u201dAt Anna\u2019s words, Johanna asked Julietta. \u201cAre you sure the Lady drank it?\u201d\u201cYes, ma\u2019am. I know how important it is, and I won\u2019t lie. The Lady told me to wait on her with the tea next time.\u201d\u201cYou mean she told you to wait on her with the tea?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dJohanna was inwardly surprised by Julietta\u2019s words. She thought Julietta was better than expected, so she would pass that she had disobeyed her order, but she thought it shouldn\u2019t happen again and opened her mouth to say something.\u201cYou must have been very good with the Lady. Still, I can\u2019t let you go of breaking my order. If this happens again, you\u2019ll be kicked out from this mansion.\u201dJulietta looked at Johanna saying in a calm voice, as if her anger had subsided. \u201cHead Maid, I have never disobeyed your orders. I just did what Anna told me to do.\u201dJulietta\u2019s words made Anna jump. \u201cShe\u2019s lying. Why would I do such a thing if it\u2019s not even my job?\u201d\u201cSo, how did I know after I\u2019ve been working in this mansion for such a short while, and how did I go into this room with a tea filled with contraceptives?\u201dJohanna alternately looked at both of them and clapped her hands to call attention from Anna and Julietta, who were staring each other to death.\u201cStop. I\u2019ll just end this thing here. But if this happens again, both of you will be kicked out of the mansion right away, so be sure.\u201dJohanna laid her words on the two and headed back to the kitchen. Anna whispered to Julietta so that she could not hear it, \u201cBah, you get to know you\u2019re lucky today. I\u2019ll certainly kick you out, so just wait.\u201d\u201cNo matter how much you think. Do you think I\u2019m just going to get beaten?\u201d\u201cAll right. Let\u2019s see who wins.\u201d\u2014-It had now been three months since Julietta started working at the Bertino mansion.The day after her first paycheck came, she went to Maribel the owner of the theater, paid back her first month\u2019s amount, and had only about eight terns of money in hand. It was the first money she had ever had in her present life.Julietta bought a pen she wanted with the money she had earned from her work, was so moved that she could buy what she wanted by herself in this way that she almost burst into tears. She cursed the poo dog Manny like going through a ritual, having given her a situation that was hard enough to cry about.Having received her third week\u2019s pay yesterday, she was on her way back to the mansion today, paying Maribel back this month\u2019s amount, meeting Lillian, Amelie and Sophie for the first in a long time and having a good time.Julietta, who arrived at the mansion around dusk, was walking along the long driveway from the main gate to the front door.The garden of the mansion, which had just entered spring, offered a stunning view of various shoots and budding flowers. She was walking leisurely, enjoying the garden, thinking her eyes could enjoy the luxurious view these days, but she heard the clattering of a carriage behind her.Few people visited Bertino mansion except for the Prince who usually visited once or twice a week, and his woman, who came with him like an addendum. Julietta, who had already wondered if it was time for him to visit, calmly backed away to avoid being seen by the owner of the carriage.As she stepped out of the street and waited with her head down, a purple carriage pulled by four black, threateningly large horses passed by.Seeing the colorful silver and purple patterns carved on the carriage door, Julietta casually raised her head, and when she found the Prince inside through the window, she made an unknowing frown. Her first encounter with the Prince, who she never wanted to face again after that day of trouble, brought back the memory that she wanted to delete.Shaking her head quickly and completely blocking her rising thoughts, she went back to her feet, thinking that the mansion would be noisy again today.\u2014\u2014-Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After that, as the servants and maids followed whispering, Julietta asked the familiar kitchen maid, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cNicole must be crazy. She suddenly took off her clothes in front of His Highness.\u201d\u2018What nonsense is this? No, it may not be absurd. Considering the Prince tried to seduce me with his colorful eyes, he might have sent a signal to Nicole as well.\u2019Julietta nodded, thinking he was a man who would do something like that, and asked, \u201cBut why is she running away crying?\u201d\u201cHey, do you think the Prince would have let her go? She needs to know who she is. How dare she take off her clothes in front of a nobleman and run at him.\u201d\u2018What on earth did he think he was doing?\u2019In the eye of Julietta, wondering about Nicole\u2019s mysterious misbehavior, a smiling Anna came in from the corner.Anna was barely holding back her laughter while watching Nicole jump up crying.Find authorized novels in ReadNovelFull\uff0cfaster updates, better experience\uff0cPlease click www.ReadNovelFull.com for visiting.\u2018You\u2019re stupid.\u2019Three months after being demoted to a maid, the butler had a scowl on his face and still disapproved of her whenever he met her, unlike her expectation that she would be promoted to a maid of the Prince again after a month or two.Since the Prince visited the residence once or twice a week, Bertino mansion did not have many users. There were few of them except for Sir Albert, the butler and the grand chamberlain, and his servant Jeff, who followed the Prince.There were ten maids, including Johanna, the head maid, who managed Bertino mansion; Rowena the head cleaning maid, Nicole, the maid of the Prince; Anna, who had been demoted to a cleaning maid; Julietta, and the other maids in charge of cleaning, kitchen, and laundry. There were five manservants, including a horseman, a gatekeeper, and a gardener.That\u2019s why it was Nicole who was able to serve the Prince after Anna had been demoted to a cleaning maid.Sir Albert, made suspicious by Anna\u2019s folly, warned Nicole again and again to be careful on that day. \u201cDo not take your eyes off to the Prince or have another motive. Otherwise, like Anna, you will be demoted to a cleaning maid or kicked out of the mansion right away.\u201dAnna thought she could not go back to the Prince\u2019s side because of Nicole\u2019s good work for three months.-Oh, Anna. He\u2019s so cool today, too. Whenever I see him, my heart flutters and my whole body shakes.-It was the daily routine of the servants and maids to pay tribute to the Prince, whenever they gathered. Nicole was equally ecstatic as soon as she met Anna, flirting with her words about what a hot night the Prince had.Even that simple story of the Prince was so proud that Anna, who was so jealous, thought that if Nicole was kicked out she could come back and had decided to go ahead with what she had planned.\u2013 Nicole, what I\u2019ve felt for a long time, don\u2019t you think the Prince\u2019s eyes look a little different at you? I thought I was mistaken, but I think I\u2019m right.-Nicole\u2019s eyes bulged with Anna\u2019s insinuating remark.\u2013 Do you think he has feelings for me?-\u2013 He looked at you once in a while when he was passing by.-Of course, it had not happened, but Anna encouraged Nicole by creating something out of nothing.\u2013 Re-really? Is that what you think?-Anna almost snorted at Nicole\u2019s simple thought.\u2013 Nicole, you also felt that. Yeah, I think so. I envy you so much, Nicole.-After being completely taken in by Anna\u2019s words, Nicole asked in excitement what she could do.\u2013 But why doesn\u2019t the Prince tell me for sure? I\u2019m ready to be held in those broad arms at any time.-\u2013 Nicole, you heard it from Jeff that he never chooses a woman. He\u2019s always given the most active woman a chance. It\u2019s ridiculous for the noble to say such things to a woman first, especially if the woman is a maid.-Nicole nodded hard when she remembered what Jeff had told her.\u2013 Yes, that\u2019s right. It must have been hard for him to show his thoughts to her.-Nicole, who misunderstood as she pleased, went back and forth frantically, asking Anna for her opinion on what to do.\u2013 What you should do is to show your mind first. It\u2019s a good chance. It\u2019s been more than three months since then.-\u201cLady Moira has served His Highness for three months. It\u2019s time for him to kick her out before she starts forming another motive, considering that the length of time women have been allowed to enter and leave the mansion is usually two to four months. So it\u2019s the right time to show your heart.\u201d\u2013 What should I say? I love you? Or just give me a hug?\u2013 Whew, you idiot! You should also consider His Highness\u2019s honor. It would be so funny if he just accepted a maid for making such a confession. You\u2019re better to take off your clothes and run at him. It would be even more strange if he refuses a woman naked, he\u2019ll accept it as it is unavoidable.Moved by the plausible remarks, Nicole embraced Anna and thanked her.\u2013 Anna, thank you very much. I will never forget this kindness. The moment I become the lover of His Highness, I\u2019ll ask him to raise you as his maid again.Anna made up her voice as if she were a bit friendly, laughing at Nicole, who hugged her neck and was delighted.\u2013 Don\u2019t forget to do that. You promised, right?Recalling the conversation that took place a few days ago, Anna once again smiled. She must have been so foolish that she had taken off her clothes in front of the Prince without any hesitation. This made her feel better and she thought it would be herself doing the duty in the Prince\u2019s bedroom tonight, but she could see an ugly face staring at her.\u2018Ow, I\u2019ve got to kick that bitch out of here.\u2019The day after that fat girl had come into the mansion, the silent war between the two had begun when she had refused to do what Anna had ordered her to. As Julietta had begun to wait on for Moira, the head maid\u2019s treatment had changed.Anna had begun to be mean in every case, unable to contain her anger: dismissing the filthy foul water from upstairs when she had passed downstairs; hiding dinner; spilling water on the bed; putting her shoes on the new sheets she had changed; and so on. She had not revealed herself, but done enough small harassing and bullying that she had stirred up the head of cleaning maids. However, Julietta hadn\u2019t always responded, but just shrugged her shoulders.As she had changed her wet clothes, ordered her meal from the kitchen again, and slept on the floor after the bed was wet, Anna had hated Julietta more day by day. After becoming the maid of the Prince again today, Anna was determined to kick her out at all costs, and waited for the butler to find her.\u201cJohanna, how the hell do you manage a maid? The Prince\u2019s anger is not just to this extent or that. He won\u2019t let it go. What are you going to do if you don\u2019t have a maid to serve him today? Why haven\u2019t you hired a maid so far, though I told you to hurry up and recruit one more?\u201dAlbert was about to get out of his mind without a maid who would take over the bedroom duty of the Prince tonight.\u201cIf it\u2019s urgent, I\u2019ll take part as my duty. Just calm down.\u201dShe had tried to recruit more maids, but it had not been easy to hire a private maid for the Prince. She had to be a close-mouthed woman, because she would watch and listen to the nobleman\u2019s nightlife. Furthermore, there was a possibility that a maid who was incited by a political enemy could come in by being hired. So, time had been passing by while she looked everywhere.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Don\u2019t talk nonsense.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m really going to have to take part then.\u201dJohanna, who had only heard of, but had never waited on, the Prince\u2019s secret life, said in a perplexed way, \u201cIs that possible?\u201dAlbert squinted at the thought of whether Johanna, a truly virtuous Baroness, could ever do it.When she saw Albert\u2019s reaction, Johanna sighed, thinking that she might have to see how great the energy of the Prince was at her elderly age. At the moment she cast a grudging glance at the stairs where Nicole had disappeared after making her run, and found a fat body staring carefully at something among the roaring maids.\u201cHis Highness wouldn\u2019t care too much about the appearance of a maid, would he?\u201d\u201cWhy? Is there anyone suitable?\u201d\u201cYes. A girl brought in a letter of recommendation from Marquis Rhodius a few months ago, but she is a good worker and sincere.\u201dUnlike her initial bad impression, she had not been swept away by the harassment of maids, but done her own work quietly. The head maid highly appraised Julietta and thought it was a good chance for her.\u201cIs she a credible maid? They would not have done such a thing if they were not trustworthy?\u201dSince the carefully chosen maids had a series of accidents, Albert said that everything was useless. Johanna answered quickly, looking at Albert muttering aimlessly, \u201cWell, we don\u2019t have much time left, so I\u2019ll bring her in and train her. Rowena, bring Julietta.\u201dAfter ordering the maid waiting by her side, Johanna waited impatiently for Julietta to come over.\u201cSay hello to him. This is Sir Albert, the private butler of His Highness Killian.\u201dSir Albert\u2019s face flushed as Julietta greeted him with her usual bouncy head.\u201cYou don\u2019t have any formal education about etiquette at all.\u201dJulietta was a little annoyed at getting called out and told about her manners. She was rebellious when someone looked down on her like that. Although she had not been taught proper etiquette since she was very young, Julietta greeted him again, as if recalling her old memories, since she knew a little about it.\u201cHappily, I think she\u2019s learned the basics. You\u2019ll just have to train her a bit more.\u201dWhen Johanna, who did not want to see the Prince\u2019s embarrassing private life at all, was satisfied, Sir Albert nodded reluctantly and said, \u201cThough her appearance troubles me, we don\u2019t have much choice at this moment, so let\u2019s get her to work. Before we go to say hello to His Highness, I\u2019ll have to do a quick review first. Let\u2019s go to my office.\u201dSir Albert\u2019s words whitened Julietta\u2019s face.\u2018His Highness? No way! Does that mean Prince Killian? What the hell is this butler talking about?\u2019When the butler, who had no idea what Julietta was thinking, hurried ahead, Johanna urged the stiff Julietta forward, pushing her back.\u201cYou must have been surprised to hear the good news all of a sudden. Your life will be really comfortable if you take care of His Highness without making any mistakes.\u201d\u201cOh, no\u2026 I\u2019m, uh, just a minute.\u201dFind authorized novels in ReadNovelFull\uff0cfaster updates, better experience\uff0cPlease click www.ReadNovelFull.com for visiting.As she was pushed into the butler\u2019s office on the first floor by Johanna, Julietta somehow tried to say no. But she was so surprised that she could not say the right word, as if her ability to speak was paralyzed.\u201cYes, I know what you mean. You must be so happy. You will be paid twice as much for doing an easy job that is not comparable to a maid\u2019s.\u201dJohanna entered the butler\u2019s office, affectionately touching the back of Julietta, who was still trying to say something and stuttered, \u201cA-A salary twice as high?\u201dEven though she wanted to say no, but the right word did not come out, a lot of words getting tangled in her head. But when she heard about her salary, it tripped off her tongue immediately.\u201cYes, it is. It is a private maid of the royal family, and it is only natural for her to get paid more. A certain amount of money will be paid for self-improvement in the Principality of Bertino every three months, and at the end of the year, there will be bonuses from the Imperial Castle, which means you have a year of hard work ahead of you. And when you\u2019re sick, the house doctor of the mansion treats you, and your severance pay is beyond comparable to that of a maid.\u201dJulieta was open-mouthed at the advanced wage system.\u2018Is it true that this is a social status society where nobles dance in dresses and make lovers?\u2019The bottom line was that the private maid of the Prince was treated as a full-time worker and the general maid was treated as a contract worker. She was the same as an intern who had worked for a passion paycheck from the age of five to seventeen. No, she didn\u2019t get a single penny, so she didn\u2019t get even a passion pay at all.Julietta quickly calculated her salary in her head. With paychecks for twice the salary and bonuses that would come out every three months, and discretionary payments that would come out every year, she could pay off her debts in forty months, which was only half the planned eighty months, and could have her own shop faster.Julietta, who had just forgotten that she had to look at the Prince\u2019s face again and that she had no words for the pressure of working at close range, asked seriously, \u201cWhat should I do?\u201dWithin an hour of training, Julietta was able to experience the sensation of flying and then falling back to the ground.\u2018What does this mean? In the end, I should take care of him after having sex with women who serve the noble.\u2019But when she recalled her salary again, she came back in a coldly from her two minds.During the Joseon Dynasty, there was a court lady in the Royal Palace, and even in the West, the lower men served the royal family members and nobility by their side. It was even said that there was a maid who would put the penis of an old king into the pussy of a queen.\u2018Yeah, it\u2019s nothing, Julietta. Even if the wage system is advanced, it is just as well! You can do it. You can do it.\u2019When Julietta\u2019s expression hardened after hearing the explanation, Johanna spoke soothingly, \u201cThat\u2019s a relief. Because the women His Highness meets aren\u2019t of noble status, they clean up their important places by themselves after the night sex. In case of ladies of high status a maid has to clean them up.\u201dJulietta\u2019s mouth was wide open from the unexpected cultural shock.\u2018No, could I have had to wipe off the, uh, parts having the man\u2019s stuff?\u2019Johanna continued to speak, as if apparently to give a further shock to Julietta.\u201cIt hasn\u2019t happened so far, but you might be able to bathe His Highness when Jeff is away. The method of serving the Prince\u2019s baths should be taught separately by Jeff when you have time later.\u201dJohanna\u2019s last words were a direct shot at Julietta.\u201cThat\u2019s never going to happen,\u201d Sir Albert said, but Julietta did not hear that. Her face turned white, even turned pale as ashes. Most of the maids were blushing when they heard this, but she seemed to be a little unusual.In any case, the temptation of a double salary, no matter what hardship or adversity was involved, was sweet. Unable to resist the temptation, Julietta took a heavy step after Sir Albert, feeling like a cow being dragged to the slaughterhouse after an hour of simple training.Killian, who had arrived a little earlier than usual at the mansion for his play on Harrods Street today, was very angry. While he was reviewing documents that had to be checked urgently in the office, the maid, who had been asked to bring a tea, committed a mad act of nakedness, saying, \u2018I will give myself to you instead of the tea.\u2019\u201cYour Highness, this is the new maid who will be working starting today. Julietta, greet him.\u201dKillian, who was in a state of displeasure after ordering the mad maid to be fired right away, spoke reluctantly, after greeting of a maid who was introduced by his butler.\u201cSo, did you bring a maid to do the right thing this time?\u201dThe Prince, who looked at the new maid with a heartless face, didn\u2019t show much emotion. Julietta felt a human touch for the unexpected appearance of the Prince.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Bertino Mansion on Harrods Street, Part VIIITranslator: KhanEditor: AelryinthMost of the first people to see her disguise expressed disgust, frowning. But the Prince in front of her seemed to not care about the outward appearance. He only checked whether she could do the job properly without altering his expression.\u201cYes, Your Highness. There was a recommendation from the head maid, Johanna, and when I watched for a while during education, she was quite a prudent and composed maid. I think she\u2019ll be okay.\u201dSir Albert thought inwardly, \u2018How much can she know after only an hour?\u2019 However, he praised Julietta, as he knew if he said he had no other maid prepared, the Prince would scold him severely.Fortunately, with Albert sighing the Prince nodded without any word and lowered his head to the papers again. Julieta breathed a sigh of relief. She didn\u2019t think he would recognize her, but she couldn\u2019t help feeling nervous.She thought it was good to have prepared her glasses. She also liked the fact that the Prince\u2019s appearance was not clear, as everything looked gray beyond the opaque lens as the cheap glasses were not processed with magic. Julietta was relieved to think that she could do it this much.\u2014\u2014After a while, the Prince took the woman into the bedroom and it was midnight.Julietta was dozing off slightly in spite of the embarrassing noises from beyond the curtains. Getting up early in the morning and going to the Eileen Theater and coming back was more exhausting than cleaning all day. Julietta, who had been promoted to the Prince\u2019s maid, was tired and closed her eyes.No matter how loud the noise was in the bedroom, it was not as exciting in contrast to her worry, since she had been schooled by all kinds of harmful media when she had lived as Jenna.In fact, the room was too big for the excitement and the curtains of the bed on one side of the large room were thick. Although the moon\u2019s glare reflected the nude scenes tossing about on the bed, it was boring because it was much less harsh than the mosaic of adult videos.She was spending time dozing off like that, and all of a sudden she got an order from the Prince,\u201cTurn on the light and bring the water.\u201dJulietta, who had been told until her ears ached, \u2018You should give a ready answer and take immediate action when you are called and ordered by the Prince,\u2019 replied reflexively in the middle of dozing off.\u201cYes, Your Highness.\u201dQuickly taking a glass of water across the wide room, Julietta held it out through the drapery of the bed to the waiting Prince. But there was no response from the inside of the curtains. While Julietta thought about what to do for a while, fortunately, she could feel a hand inside holding the glass.As she waited with her hand stretched out to take the glass back, suddenly the Prince, without anything on, appeared after opening the curtains.\u201cWake her up and let her go out.\u201dKillian was briefly embarrassed by the glass of water sticking through the curtains, soon after he gave the order. This was the first time he\u2019d ever been treated so rudely.As he stared at the glass which appeared in the air, he felt the maid was embarrassed beyond the curtains, and the water in the glass was about to overflow. Even though Killian reluctantly accepted the glass, her hands stopped in midair as if she asked him to give it back when he drank it all.Killian stared at the ill-mannered hand, emptied the glass, then sprang up and stepped out of bed. His sudden move was followed by a strange sound of \u201chi-i-ik\u201d as he ran head-on into the maid who had not stepped back.The main character of the sound hurried back, frightened as if she had met a monster. Killian\u2019s eyebrows were raised by the unusual behavior of the maid that he had never seen before.\u201cWhat did you mean by that sound now?\u201dWith his hands on the waist of his naked body and standing confidently, Julietta wanted to beat herself for not carrying a towel.However, even if she had a towel, she wondered if he would accept it, as he was standing there confidently. Julietta, who had imagined the man with a statue-like body in front of her was wearing a white towel around the area he seemed most confident in, quickly came to her senses at the sight of the Prince, who was staring at her.Having felt the danger of being fired on the first day, she thought for a moment about what to say.\u2018Do I have to say that I was freaked out by your nakedness? Or is it because it was so grand that I was speechless?\u2019Having barely endured what she wanted to say, to be honest, Julietta said with deliberate wheezing of breath, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Your Highness. When I am surprised, I get choked up because of my asthma, and a strange sound comes out. Please forgive me.\u201dThe Prince\u2019s face did not soften, though she deliberately stopped breathing once.Killian looked at the maid with half-closed eyes, looked around the little eyes behind thick glasses, and she suddenly breathed as if she was having a hard time breathing. She was better than the ladies who were mesmerized when they saw him, but he was not happy to see her head turned to one side as if she had seen something she had not wanted to see.\u201cReally? That\u2019s right. Good. But why are you looking elsewhere when you talk to me? You are very cheeky!\u201dFind authorized novels in ReadNovelFull\uff0cfaster updates, better experience\uff0cPlease click www.ReadNovelFull.com for visiting.At Killian\u2019s reproach, Julietta turned her head reluctantly.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I heard I shouldn\u2019t face them when I\u2019m talking to someone high\u2026\u201dKillian snorted at the maid in front of him, holding her head straight as if she should never look down.\u201cReally? That\u2019s good. You can look at me straight from now on. I will let you.\u201d\u2018I heard the Prince doesn\u2019t like to look at himself.\u2019Julietta was embarrassed by the order she had been given, different from the instructions she had received. Killian, who had already wiped away the fact that he had been angry at a maid because she had looked at him and been mesmerized a few months ago from his head, gave her instructions as he went to the bathroom.\u201cWake her up before I come out and let her leave.\u201dJulietta stood still, her head drooping gently until she could not see the Prince, and then opened the curtains to wake up the woman sprawled on the bed.\u201cLady, Lady, get up.\u201dMoira, who had fainted due to ecstasy after the enchanting act of the Prince, woke up from her sleep at the shaking of a hand.\u201cUh, where is His Highness?\u201dJulietta, who hurriedly roused Moira, groped about her and forced her to don a gown. \u201cHe went into the bathroom. I have to wait on His Highness, so you have to wear this.\u201dJulietta called Jeff waiting in front of the door after she was forced to put a gown on Moira\u2019s unconscious body. Jeff, who came in as soon as the door opened, asked urgently, \u201cHow long has he been in?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been a while, the Lady couldn\u2019t get up right away.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll get another scolding again. Next time, please hurry up a bit.\u201dJeff, who was disgusted by the fact that the maid he had to work with was a poor-looking woman, quickly let go of his expression when he saw the woman in bed who was half-dressed. He asked her to hurry, but he glanced over her by walking as slowly as he could from the front door along the short distance to the bathroom. When Julietta, displeased by his sultry eyes, stood to cover Moira\u2019s loose outfit, only then did Jeff go into the bathroom.Julietta helped Moira, who was still half-conscious, rise up and handed her over to her maid, who was waiting at the door. After that, she started to hurry up and clean up the bed.The short impression that the work was easier than she thought passed.\u2014\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Bertino Mansion on Harrods Street, Part IXTranslator: KhanEditor: AelryinthA message arrived that the Prince, who rarely visited due to his hectic new business, would visit his mansion for the first in a long time. Anna, exhausted from cleaning to greet the owner all morning, threw a mop that was used to clean the hallway window on the second floor.\u201cOh, this drives me nuts. How long do I have to do this?\u201dA month ago, Anna, who successfully kicked out Nicole, donned a dress and makeup, and was waiting for the butler\u2019s call. But when Moira arrived and went into the Prince\u2019s bedroom, she was not called for a while. She felt strange, went to the head maid, and heard the surprising news that the new ugly maid would serve the Prince.Anna, who was stunned, protested fiercely, but only heard the cold words of leaving the mansion if she didn\u2019t like the position of a maid.Anna, who had packed her belongings with anger, unpacked them again. It was because she thought the Prince would kick Julietta out if he saw her ugly face.However, a month had already passed. The order to drive the ugly girl out had yet to fall from the mouth of the Prince, who still visited the Bertino mansion, though it had become rarer than before.Anna murmured, glancing at the mop that had fallen on the slithering floor, \u201cYes\u2026 because a new maid hasn\u2019t come in yet, if she\u2019s gone, they\u2019ll have no choice but to call me back this time.\u201dAnna agonized over how to get the girl out of this house. Just in time, she saw a large body coming up the stairs. In a black maid\u2019s dress, Anna, who had been gazing at the bulky figure in a brown maid\u2019s dress, naturally followed her back into the Prince\u2019s bedroom.After four months, the Prince\u2019s bedroom was no different than it used to be. The Prince\u2019s favorite musk was veiled in the room, and the bed, which occupied one side of the spacious room, was covered with black silk sheets for the owner to stay in today.Anna, imagining herself lying with the Prince on those luxurious sheets, smiled to Julietta, who came out of the bathroom after cleaning it. \u201cI was wondering if I could help you.\u201dJulietta\u2019s face was sulky, and she smiled pretentiously, as if she had never wanted to tear the other woman\u2019s eyes out.The Prince\u2019s bedroom was a place where no one but the head maid and Julietta could come and go. On the ordinary days when the Prince did not visit, it was locked tightly with a key and only the two had the key. When cleaning in the morning and evening, two maids under Julietta\u2019s supervision came in and cleaned, and Anna was not included in the task.Also, everything used in the Prince\u2019s room had to go through Julietta\u2019s hands to get into the room. The tea leaves that the Prince drank could only be brought by Sir Albert himself from the imperial city, and for the bedding and clothing that touched the Prince\u2019s body there was a separate maid, so Julietta directed her.In other words, if anything happened to the Prince, Julietta, who was in charge, would be punished.\u201cDid you get permission?\u201dWhen Julietta asked, Anna replied with a whimper, \u201cHey, not long ago, I was doing what you are doing. And if you are talking about permission, it is ridiculous. I didn\u2019t come in when nobody else was here, but I came in like this when you were here.\u201dAnna looked quickly through the room, wondering if there was any way to kick the girl out. Julietta replied, as if she had seen through Anna\u2019s thoughts, \u201cIf there\u2019s anything wrong with His Highness in this room today, keep in mind, Anna, that you are to blame.\u201dAnna had to bow before Julietta\u2019s threats before she could do anything. She had felt it last time; unlike her dull-looking appearance, Julietta was really a sly bitch.\u201cI will leave now. I just wanted to see this room for the first after a long time.\u201dAnna\u2019s quick exit from the room, like a girl who had committed a crime, seemed to imply that she was bound to commit an accident.Coming out of the Prince\u2019s bedroom, Anna picked up the mop from the floor of the hallway again, and went down to the first floor without even looking at the window she had stopped wiping.Anna, who was trying to figure out how to punish Julietta, finally saw Moira, who came in alone. Upon seeing Moira arriving earlier than usual, Anna threw the mop she was holding back into the corner and ran quickly to greet her.\u201cI haven\u2019t seen you in a long time, Lady. How have you been?\u201dMoira nodded dryly at the greeting of the maid, who she had not seen since she was severely scolded by the Prince a few months ago.\u201cYes, it\u2019s been a long time. I thought you were kicked out of the mansion, but I guess that wasn\u2019t true.\u201dAs Moira looked around for the head maid who should be waiting for her, Anna took her umbrella and hat, and said, \u201cI\u2019ll tell the head maid that you\u2019re here. I think she has something urgent to do.\u201dIn Bertino mansion, where there was no resident butler, the head maid was almost taking over the duties of the butler.\u201cGet Julie.\u201d\u201cOh, Julie told me to serve you today,\u201d replied Anna, who handed over the hat and umbrella to Moira\u2019s private maid, said as she took the lead toward the room where Moira would stay.Anna decided to kick Julietta out today. If she were to kick Moira out with her, she might have a chance to serve the Prince tonight. Moira bit her lips and fell into thought without knowing what Anna was thinking.Four months had passed while she had been the Prince\u2019s lover. In a secret club of aristocratic men, it said that bets were going on when Moira would be abandoned by him.For more than fifteen days after her last night with the Prince, she could hardly sleep due to anxiety and nervousness. When the invitation to Bertino mansion arrived last night, she could barely fall asleep in relief.Moira, who had woken up early in the morning, had a perfumed massage all day to calm her nervousness. But as soon as it was a time that she wouldn\u2019t look bad to the Prince, she arrived at Bertino mansion.She nervously held her hands as she walked through the familiar corridor.\u2018How long will I be able to come and go from this mansion?\u2019Moira didn\u2019t think of arriving earlier than usual, and felt uneasy about no one coming out to greet her.\u2018Did Julie notice something and refuse to serve me, since I\u2019m about to leave here?\u2019Entering the assigned room, Moira took off her clothes under the care of Anna and her private maid. Moira entered the perfumed bath without noticing Anna who was looking at her naked body with her eyes slightly open, stared blankly as her private maid washed her.\u201cAnna, why did Julie ask you to escort me?\u201dEntering the bathroom at Moira\u2019s question, Anna answered politely, hiding a shady smile.\u201cI don\u2019t know. Now I have no choice but to do what she says because she is in a higher position than I am. But when I asked, \u2018How can I serve the noble lady as a cleaning maid,\u2019 she said, \u2018I don\u2019t mind because she will not last long.'\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dAnna\u2019s answer seemed to be the reality she had been worrying about.\u201cWhy did Julie say that? She is not the kind of person who would say that without thinking. Did the Prince say anything?\u201dAt the quivering question of Moira, Anna jumped, shaking her hands.\u201cHe must not have said anything. His Highness is not the one who would say that to a maid. I know for sure because I served him much longer than Julie. Furthermore, at least three times she has seen the Prince himself.\u201d\u201cThen why the hell did she say that?\u201d\u201cJulie has changed a lot since she became the maid of the Prince. You might have missed the change of knowing who she is, but we all know. Julie often swears at you.\u201dFind authorized novels in ReadNovelFull\uff0cfaster updates, better experience\uff0cPlease click www.ReadNovelFull.com for visiting.\u201cShe swears at me?\u201d\u201cYes. She once laughed when she cleaned the room before you came, saying that you didn\u2019t know who you were because you were asking for a red sheet when he wouldn\u2019t even have to come.\u201dSaying what the maids had been whispering among themselves as if Julie had said those things, Anna lowered her head slightly to hide the tip of her mouth going up.Moira jumped up from the bathtub, at a loss for words.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Bertino Mansion on Harrods Street, Part XTranslator: KhanEditor: AelryinthThere was a time when the story of Julietta came out, as she happened to talk with Lillian in the theater. No matter how much she was a fan of her own, she couldn\u2019t take good care of her appearance, so she complained a lot, and Lillian said, \u2018Julie is a really nice girl,\u2019 and asked her to be nice to her.She didn\u2019t have to listen to that, but it was true that she had been doing a good job of supporting her, unlike the maids who used to treat her with dry spirits before.\u2018I can\u2019t believe she said that behind the scenes.\u2019After donning a gown handed to her by her private maid, Moira looked back at Anna. \u201cWhere is Julie now?\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Killian suddenly burst into laughter as he sat in a carriage across Harrods Street, looking out the moonlit street. The eyes of Albert and Jeff in front of him were round, but Killian was thinking about the new maid of the mansion, without noticing them at all.Killian had never been conscious of their gaze, as he had always been surrounded by servants, maids, and knights. They were nothing more or less then servants and maids for his convenience.After getting to know a woman at the age of seventeen, he had maintained a proper sex and social life, just like ordinary men. Before having a separate house on Harrods Street, he had brought women into his rooms at the Imperial Castle.Then there was an incident that made him think he needed a private mansion and a maid in charge of his nightlife. He felt that calling a woman to the Imperial Castle might give unwanted expectations to the other party.It had been the day after his twentieth birthday party.That day a woman began scratching at Killian\u2019s temper before he even started a love affair. When she went to and from the Imperial Castle as his lover, she gained another motive in no time. If there were no problems, he did not feel a need to change the woman, but it was the reason that the relationship lasted for more than six months.Angry at her sneaking attempt to pressure him for an official position, Killian called in the waiters outside send her out. But it was the knights who were on guard duty who came in. Knights in armor rushed in at Killian\u2019s angry call, instead of the servants and maids who had been away for a while. At that moment, the naked woman clinging to Killian began shouting shamefully.The woman was taken away by a late-returning maid, but for a while there was a scandal circulating in the mouths of dilettantes about Prince Bertino, who shared his women with his knights.It was obvious who spread the ridiculous scandal, but Killian, who didn\u2019t intend to go through it again, had put the maid on standby in his bedroom like the old aristocrats. The old aristocrats meant to have comfortable affairs, but Killian\u2019s purpose was for her to take on the role of a witness, that he did not share women with others.But there was something he overlooked. When Killian, who was a dangerous person with his own presence, walked back and forth with his naked body in front of maids, the maids were often mesmerized.But a unique maid who was not mesmerized, but even indifferent, came in. Other maids ran over when he called, trying to look good to him or to speak with him for longer, but this maid just slightly raised her eyebrows. The look was so funny, and if he often called on her to no purpose, she pretended to be polite at first, but what she was thinking was revealed on her face without her knowledge.In the previous week, he had asked her to give him a cup of tea and let it go without drinking it on purpose, and then he asked her to bring it back with a hot cup of tea, so she raised her eyebrows even further. It was so funny that he ordered the same thing two or three more times, and the arrogant lady came up and said, \u201cYour Highness, in exactly how many minutes more would you like to have a hot cup of tea? I think it would be saving tea leaves or water if I had it ready in time.\u201dKillian gave high marks to her imposing figure.\u2018To be unreasonable is to be unreasonable.

Moira bent down in a hurry with her hands down.\u201cYour Highness.\u201d\u201cI welcome Your Highness.\u201dAnna greeted him with a coquettish attitude at the sight of the Prince, whom she saw him close up for the first time a few months.Killian looked at the three women in the room in turn and turned to Julietta.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201dJulietta sighed deeply, fixing her flowing glasses. \u201cI don\u2019t know either. She came up suddenly and slapped me in the face.\u201dAs Killian\u2019s cold eyes turned toward Moira, she began to cry anxiously.\u201cYour Highness, that insolent maid ignored me. I\u2019m your woman. To ignore me like that would be an act of contempt for you, too. So how can I bear it?\u201dMoira sobbed more sadly and approached as if to be held in Killian\u2019s arms. Killian took a step back from Moira and gestured her to continue.\u201cI just want to look beautiful to Your Highness. In case you wouldn\u2019t visit my room, I asked her to prepare a red sheet that would suit me, and it seemed funny to her. I heard she had said I didn\u2019t even know who I was. Today, she even told that I would be kicked out soon, so it would not be necessary to serve me.\u201dKillian turned to Julietta, whose mouth was open in embarrassment, after he watched Moira, who was gazing at his face with a lace handkerchief. Feeling the gaze, Julietta began to protest with resentment.\u201cYour Highness, no. I never said that, or thought about it. How could I say such a thing as I was not in your heart, and I was not sure whether you would kick out Moira or not? And I\u2019m not proud of it, but there\u2019s no one close enough to say that, since I\u2019m treated as an outcast.\u201dKillian asked Julietta, who proudly sputtered out her words and then showed signs of embarrassment. \u201cWhat\u2019s an outcast?\u201dHe understood what it meant, but he asked her because it was so funny that she felt a little awkward, and she frowned.\u201cWell, the sole person in the crowd? Is someone full of integrity? The only figure among liars? In other words, it is a crane who does not want to match with heads with chickens; that\u2019s what it means.\u201d\u2018You mean you\u2019re a loner, without a close friend, now?\u2019Killian smiled at Julietta, who turned her head shamefully after she explained the term \u201coutcast\u201d to her best advantage, turned to Moira again.\u201cWho did you hear that from?\u201dAs the look that had been settled down for a while became icy again, Moira faltered and turned toward Anna. Anna looked up confidently as she measured the situation.\u201cI see a maid who shouldn\u2019t be in this room, Albert.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Your Highness. I\u2019ll kick her out right away. Jeff!\u201dAs Jeff, who was instructed by Albert, approached, Anna pushed forward against Moira, who was standing in front of Killian.\u201cYour Highness, that girl said something that looked down on the Lady, asking me to wait on for her.

The Principality of BertinoA month after Anna and Moira were kicked out, a new woman of the Prince visited the Bertino mansion.The widow Viscountess, who was from the Kingdom of Lebatum, scoured Julietta in her first day at the mansion. From the first day on, she slapped Julietta in the face and shouted, \u201cIf I become the Prince\u2019s concubine, I won\u2019t let you go,\u201d but she was kicked out after visiting the mansion two more times.Since then, when there had been no Prince\u2019s woman visiting the mansion for several weeks. Julietta had lived a leisurely life after a week\u2019s vacation at the theater before she returned to the Bertino mansion.She was taught manners and basic skills, as a maid serving the Prince should know, by Johanna in the morning, and spent the afternoon reading various books in the library of the mansion or doing what was ordered. It was such a peaceful life that she thought it wouldn\u2019t matter if it meant staying in disguise for the rest of her life.Today Julietta was going down to the basement to do what Johanna had ordered.\u201cJulietta, come out here.\u201d Julieta, who was checking the ingredients for the new order in the food storage, stopped at the sound of a maid\u2019s voice, and went back upstairs.\u201cThe head maid is looking for you. Go to the office.\u201dAt the maid\u2019s words, Julietta shook off the dust from her maid uniform and went into Johanna\u2019s office with her head raised and her back straight as she had learned.\u201cCome, Julie. Hurry up and pack your belongings.\u201dJulietta looked at Johanna, wondering what she was talking about. Johanna held out a letter she was holding.\u201cThe maid who has served His Highness was fired as of yesterday, huh? There\u2019s no proper girl there or here. I am in big trouble. It\u2019s Sir Albert\u2019s letter to send you along in haste, because His Highness will leave today for the Principality of Bertino, but he doesn\u2019t have time to find anyone else.\u201d\u2018What this is about throwing a stone into this quiet lake\u2026\u2019Julietta managed to patch up her twisted expression. She had thought she\u2019d finally be comfortable. She wondered if this might be a conspiracy of the dimensional dog who could not see her at ease. But she couldn\u2019t say no, so she answered politely and went up to her room to pack.Julietta piously swore at the dimensional dog Manny today as she put a few belongings into her bag, accepting her fate neatly.\u2018Yes, let\u2019s think of it as a little trip. I\u2019ll leave this mansion and look around other countries this time. It won\u2019t be long since it\u2019s only until they get another maid, anyway. I am the only one who loses something if I go crazy, so let\u2019s think well of it.\u201dMoments later, Julietta went down to the first floor with a bag of extra clothes. It had only three dresses, some underwear in it, some leftover cash after paying for her debt, and a bag for cosmetics for disguise.\u201cI\u2019ll go and return.\u201d\u201cOkay, I believe you will behave well, as you have learned. If you irritate His Highness, you won\u2019t see him again, so you must devote your attention to the task at hand. Do you understand?\u201d\u2018Where is her scary and cool-headed figure from the first time?\u2019Johnna couldn\u2019t stop worrying about and requested so many things. Julietta nodded to the words, as if she might never see her again if she was cut off.\u201cYes, I will be more careful, and will be back after I have finished my work safely. I\u2019ll see you later.\u201dOther maids who whispering in the corner did not seem to be intending to say goodbye, so Julietta said goodbye to only the head maid, and then climbed into the unglazed little carriage waiting in front of the mansion.The carriage carrying Julietta, left Harrods Street and passed through Eloz Street, and got onto Eldira Street where the noblemen\u2019s mansions surrounded the Imperial Castle. The district of these nobles, named after the Empress of Austern, was not a place to enter even if someone had money. It was a dream street for the newly established aristocrats or nobles who were promoted to central government posts, as the historic families with both status and financial resources were occupying sites in order of the titles of nobility, centering around Imperial Castle.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The Principality Of Bertino, Part IITranslator: KhanEditor: AelryinthThere was a long line of mansions along the five-pronged roads, with the Imperial Castle in the middle. In particular, the five mansions most closely situated around the Imperial Castle were the homes of the five Peacocks, the highest aristocrats in Austern, of which Dudley and Kiellini families adjoined each other along the road.Find authorized novels in ReadNovelFull\uff0cfaster updates, better experience\uff0cPlease click www.ReadNovelFull.com for visiting.Recalling the map that she had been interested in before, Julietta passed by Eldira Street, which she had never been to before, and an emblem of a family that she had seen often somewhere came into her eyes. It was an emblem that remained in young Julietta\u2019s memory. The emblem was on the carriage of Marquis Anais, when he had come to see Stella and Julietta, and her heart beat strangely.Julietta mumbled, rubbing her pounding heart, \u201cJulietta, even though he is a father who abandoned you, your heart beats even when you see his mansion?\u201dIn front of the iron gate with the family emblem of Anais on it stood knights on guard, beyond them was an endless garden.Having rubbed her chest once again to think that the golden-haired Marquis that looked just like her might be out there, Julietta turned to the great castle of golden light at the end of the road.Realizing that the destination of the carriage was there, she finally realized that her employer was the Prince of this great country, living in a beautiful castle that seemed to come from fairy tales. Bewitched and gazing about and admiring, the carriage went through the small back door into the Imperial Castle.\u2014\u2014The inside of the castle, which was brilliantly decorated with gold, was as colorful as the outside. The carriage stopped at the back of a castle a little way from the main castle, passing through a park-like garden decorated with all kinds of sculptures, flowers, and trees along a smooth stretch of road. Feeling nervous as she arrived at her destination, Julietta carefully stepped down from the carriage.Julietta looked up at the gentle, calm castle of pale purple, unlike the main golden castle, realized her appearance and laughed. It was funny to think of herself as a girl from the countryside in an old drama who had just moved up to a big city.The driver told her to wait and went inside. Julietta decided not to be too shabby when someone to guide her came out, and straightened up her clothes that had crumpled while riding in the carriage, and stood upright as she had learned.Her back was sore and her legs were asleep by the time a middle-aged woman dressed neatly in a gray dress finally came out from the inside.\u201cIs this Julietta from Harrods Street?\u201dAt the dignified voice, Julietta bowed quickly. \u201cYes. I\u2019m Julietta Salmon. It\u2019s a pleasure to meet you.\u201dWhen Julietta, an illegitimate child who had not been added to her family register, greeted her politely with the last name of her mother, as she had learned from Johanna, the woman nodded in satisfaction.\u201cI am Countess Auguste, the head maid of His Highness Killian\u2019s Asta Castle. I\u2019ll just say this briefly, because I don\u2019t have time since His Highness will leave for the Principality of Bertino soon. I don\u2019t expect anything from you because you are on a temporary job until I get another maid, anyway. I just hope that you won\u2019t be fired until I find a proper maid. Do you understand?\u201dJulietta, who was once again told not to be fired here, replied politely with her eyes down, \u201cI\u2019ll do my best, as I would like to get back to Harrods Street.\u201dCountess Auguste, who nodded again at Julietta\u2019s answer, opened her mouth as if something were unexpected. \u201cBut you\u2019re not as fat as I thought you would be. Have you lost a lot of weight?\u201dJulietta, who was pricked by her conscience, nodded at her words. \u201cYes. I thought I\u2019d have to lose weight if I wanted to continue working as a maid of His Highness.\u201dWhen Julietta first came to work in Bertino mansion, it was winter, so she could wear a linen cloak with cotton, but it was too much to wear after early summer. So she was forced to make a new summer dress for disguise.She took off the cotton-filled undergarments on her waist and hips. Instead, the waist and hips of the maid\u2019s suit, which was three sizes larger than her, were fixed in a circle with wires used by aristocratic women to inflate their skirts. The fabric would stick to the body so that the curves of the waist and hips were not revealed. She also added cotton to the shoulder padding to make them look bigger.The present-day Julietta was still an ugly maid with large, broom-like rough brick-red hair, though not as burdensome as before, as the overall mass that had been rounded off with cotton had disappeared.\u201cBut you must have wanted to go on with your work, judging by your efforts. Sir Albert said not to be surprised at your appearance, but it was a relief. Come on, follow me.\u201dJulietta breathed a sigh of relief for a moment, feeling like she had safely passed the first line, and then followed Mrs. Auguste into the splendid castle.\u2014\u2014Upon arriving at Sir Albert\u2019s office under her guidance, Julietta had to listen again and again about what to do on this journey.\u201cWe can\u2019t go all the way there at one time. We\u2019ve been recovering since the Magic Square, which is connected to the Principality of Bertino, was destroyed during the war. In Baden Territory, the destination of the Magic Square, we will spend one night and go to the neighboring Deuwabo City, and cross the border. From there we will ride in a carriage for many days and move to Ricaren, the capital of Bertino. Because of the long travel time, His Highness will feel pretty bad. So be careful of everything, over and over. Do you understand?\u201d\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\u201cWhat you\u2019re going to do on the move will be dictated by Jeff. The most important thing among them is to prepare tea. His Highness won\u2019t want Jeff\u2019s tea, if it is possible. So if he wants tea while on the move, get it ready right away.\u201dAt the butler\u2019s words, Julietta faltered. Having never camped, she couldn\u2019t have set fire to a tree branch. Of course, the highest-ranking Prince\u2019s Bertino mansion was equipped with all kinds of convenient magical items, but she couldn\u2019t help but worry because they weren\u2019t big enough to carry.\u201cHow do I prepare the tea? I haven\u2019t made a fire because I\u2019ve never been on a trip.\u201dAt Julietta\u2019s words, Sir Albert shook the bell lying on the desk, as if not to worry.\u201cIan, bring me the glass bottle His Highness uses on his trip.\u201dThe brown-haired servant with a good impression stepped outside at Albert\u2019s command and came in a moment later with something.Albert took a glass bottle a little longer than his palm and held it out to Julietta. \u201cIt\u2019s a magic glass bottle that can keep his tea at the same temperature all the time.\u201dThe transparent glass bottle had a colorful silver emblem on it, very beautiful and expensive to touch.Albert reached out as if to ask Julietta to give it back after she looked at the glass bottle. He opened the lid and poured water directly into the teacup on the desk. Definitely magical, as when she touched it, the bottle was cold, but steaming water came out of the bottle.Albert said unexpectedly, after looking at Julietta\u2019s unmoved expression, as she thought of it as merely a modern thermos, \u201cYou\u2019re not surprised. Isn\u2019t this magical?\u201dJulietta, who was watching without thinking about anything, just expressed her admiration, feeling that she made a mistake. \u201cI was so surprised that I was looking blankly. But where should I boil the water to put in that glass bottle?\u201dAlbert picked up the kettle next to the teacup at Julietta\u2019s question and filled the glass bottle with water.\u201cIt holds enough for three cups of tea at a time. You don\u2019t have to boil the water separately; if you put cold water in it, it boils to heat inside the bottle and is preserved at that temperature.\u201dThis time, Julietta was genuinely surprised. She understood it as a thermos, but the water was boiling inside! As expected, the magic items used by the royal family seemed to be of different levels.\u201cYou\u2019ll have to keep it safe. I don\u2019t have to tell you how expensive it is?\u201dJulietta had no idea what the cost would be, but agreed that it would be absurdly expensive and nodded.\u201cNow, then, we\u2019ll be leaving in an hour, and the rest will be explained by Mrs. Auguste.\u201d\u2014\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The Principality Of Bertino, Part IIITranslator: KhanEditor: AelryinJulietta realized that she was living on a different level than when she had been Jenna. The Magic Square!Riding next to the horseback seat of the most expensive of the colorful carriages standing in a row in front of Asta Castle, Julietta drove an hour out of the castle and arrived in a small castle surrounded by moats. Entering the castle\u2019s annex, she stepped onto the complex pattern as the last member of the Prince\u2019s party.The scenery around her changed with a little dizziness as she waited on the Magic Square with the other servants and maids. She was standing there with her mouth wide open and dumb, and heard a sneer from the side.\u201cYou, the fat ugly girl, have come up in the world. You know, you\u2019ve been riding this expensive Magic Square.\u201dFrom the first day on, it was Jeff, the Prince\u2019s servant who rebuked and frowned at her for being ugly. However, since it was a trivial matter that didn\u2019t hurt at all, Julietta looked down at Jeff and climbed onto the stool of the carriage the Prince was riding.She turned her eyes around as she watched Jeff, who was following her from behind, in a sullen manner and was caught in a scolding by Sir Albert.As she felt when she stood in line for the Magic Square, the size of the party for the trip of a member of the royal family enormous. About a dozen carriages, purposes unknown, were standing in line, and the numbers of knights on guard and servants and maids to wait on them numbered dozens.By the time she was done being flustered on her first trip and amazed at the great size, the carriages started.Julietta was excited because she had not yet met the Prince in the carriage. She\u2019d been thinking that she\u2019d been living in comfort these days. She neatly forgot what she had earlier called Manny\u2019s conspiracy, and began to enjoy the scenery around her.For Julietta, who had only lived in the most bustling city on the continent, the capital of the Austern Empire, the sight now was new and beautiful. Even though she couldn\u2019t afford to travel abroad, she was so excited that she was humming a happy tune without knowing it.It was early summer, and the weather was so bright that she couldn\u2019t open her eyes properly. The driver, in his fifties, was very kind. As he drove for another two hours, talking to her as she was the nearly same age as his youngest daughter, a small window opened behind the horseback seat that led to the inside of the carriage.\u201cHis Highness is looking for the tea, so get ready.\u201dThe little window slammed shut as soon as the conversation was finished, as if he didn\u2019t want to bump into her face.Julietta unknowingly stuck her tongue out at the closed window. She refused to deal with him, but it was an inadvertent act at Jeff\u2019s impudent behavior.Julietta, feeling much better at the small rebellion, opened a box of tea she had left next to the driver\u2019s seat to prepare the tea. She poured the tea leaves carefully into the net of the kettle inside. Then she unbuttoned two buttons on the front of her maid\u2019s uniform.Julietta, wary of breaking the unimaginably expensive glass bottle, emptied the small pouch she had put among her belongings and hung the tight cord around her neck to keep it in her loose maid\u2019s suit. The glass bottle, which was not light, caused her neck pain and the front of her chest to pop out badly, but it didn\u2019t matter.Find authorized novels in ReadNovelFull\uff0cfaster updates, better experience\uff0cPlease click www.ReadNovelFull.com for visiting.Taking out the precious glass bottle that had been kept in her arms like a ritual offering, Julietta carefully opened the lid on the shaky wagon and poured water into the kettle. The driver, who heard the order to prepare the tea, slowly reduced the speed of the carriage, so she could accomplish her task of brewing the tea safely even on the moving carriage.Julietta, silently cursing the Prince to her heart\u2019s content, who just HAD to drink tea in a luxurious porcelain cup during a trip, poured the tea in a gold porcelain cup and placed the cup on a saucer, as it seemed to have brewed properly. Then she knocked on the carriage window.\u2018What is this?\u2019Julietta could swear to heaven that she had not the slightest desire to avenge Jeff. It was bad luck and inevitably doom the bad-tempered Jeff that the slow, well-traveled carriage rocked.It wouldn\u2019t have happened if Jeff had appeared right away and received the teacup when she had called. The moment of delay before Jeff finally opened the window, took the glass and turned around, taking his time as if he were trying to do something mean, the carriage jolted loudly if it was caught by a pothole. With that, the hot tea was spilled on him.Because of Jeff, who was throwing away the teacup and was screaming with his chin and face covered by his hands, the carriage carrying the Prince stopped.The procession quickly became chaotic as the escort knights surrounded the carriage to protect the Prince at the sudden uproar. Sir Albert, who was in another carriage, ran up in fright, and while the captain of the knights looked into the Prince\u2019s safety, Julietta jumped off the stool and tried to turn aside to look inside.It wasn\u2019t her fault, but as it was her first assignment, Julietta, who was afraid of mishaps, approached the opened door to see the situation inside the carriage. She dropped her head over those who looked after the Prince\u2019s safety, and met the gaze of the Prince who was sitting there elegantly, as if he had nothing to do with Jeff, who was covering his face and wailing.It\u2019d already been months since she had worked as his maid at Bertino mansion, but Julietta, still burdened with facing the Prince, frowned at the series of misfortunes.The Prince\u2019s casual look changed when he saw that her face was twisted like chewing an astringent persimmon as soon as she met his eyes. Julietta hurried to turn around, but at the same time she was given the Prince\u2019s stern order, seeing his eyes bend slightly, as if he had seen something funny.\u201cTake Jeff away and heal him, and you, come in the carriage.\u201dJulietta realized that her pleasant carriage trip was over. Again, the conspiracy of the dimension manager, the mongrel dog, was clear.As soon as the Prince\u2019s order was issued, Jeff, who was still crying, was carried away and the crowd dispersed quickly, leaving the area around the carriage empty in a flash.Julietta couldn\u2019t delay any longer, seeing the Prince leaning over and looking at her with his legs crossed, as if he wanted her to come in quickly. As she reluctantly climbed into the carriage with the look of someone being pulled in from behind, the door closed immediately, even as the box of tea formerly sitting on the stool was quickly placed inside the carriage. It was assumed to be a skill of Sir Albert, given that he had even taken care of the box of tea.As soon as Julietta sat back carefully on the edge of the velvet chair, which looked as if it would be impossible to escape from if she leaned back, instructions fell from the Prince\u2019s mouth.\u201cTea.\u201d\u2018Yes, I\u2019ll give it to you. If you\u2019d like a cup of tea, it\u2019s Julietta\u2019s duty to stand by right away! I\u2019ll prepare it right away.\u2019Julietta turned around and began unbuttoning the front of her dress.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d The shrill voice of the Prince, watching Julietta\u2019s actions, sounded inside the carriage. Julietta, who was stunned enough to cause convulsions at that unexpected rage, managed to recover her heart and then shot back without realizing it, \u201cYou asked for tea!\u201d\u201cBut why did you untie the buttons on your clothes?\u201dJulieta, who had been anxious to think that the Prince might have misunderstood, even shook her hands and insisted on her innocence. \u201cNo, this is, uh, don\u2019t misunderstand! I didn\u2019t mean to take off my clothes and rush into you, but I keep that expensive glass bottle in here. If you keep your eyes closed, I\u2019ll get it out.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The Principality Of Bertino, Part IVTranslator: KhanEditor: AelryinthThere was a sudden silence in the carriage. It was because of Julietta\u2019s blatant declaration not to worry because she had no intention of going at him, and the silence created by Killian, who was embarrassed by the realization that he had thought too far ahead.Whether the heavy silence devoured the carriage or not, Julietta, who was only hovered in her head with the words \u201cIf the Prince wants, you should act right away,\u201d put her hand into the dress, looking at the Prince\u2019s gaze, and carefully pulled out a glass bottle worth an expensive ransom.The Prince\u2019s expression, seeing the glass bottle in a crude pocket made from a hideous brown dress, frowned, but he managed to say nothing. In fear of being picked on again, Julietta moved as carefully as possible in her preyed-on mood in front of the beast, once again brewing the tea into an extra teacup, and then politely thrusting it out to the Prince.Julieta breathed out a sigh of relief only after seeing the Prince drinking tea with a sour look on his face.She was at a loss in this stuffy, tight atmosphere where she might have to ride in a carriage with the Prince for three weeks. Hoping that such an unfortunate event would not happen, Julietta prayed with all her heart for Jeff\u2019s quick recovery.It was time for Julietta, who prayed for the quick recovery with a more devoted heart than to swear at Manny, to look out the window with as much as possible crushed in the corner, wary of eye contact with the picky employer, even by mistake.\u201cIt\u2019s too dazzling. Lower the curtains.\u201d\u2018Ugh, this nasty person,\u2019 Julietta grumbled, thinking \u2018Everything I do is obviously not what the Prince likes\u2019 and gazed at his face with all her might.After lowering the curtain on the window, which was the only refuge in this prison of a dark interior blocked from sunlight, she held her breath. In the stifling atmosphere, she swallowed a curse and breathed in and out carefully, but there was a sarcastic comment from the eerie Prince.\u201cIf you don\u2019t have a mind to show off your breasts to me, button them.\u201dShe had untied the two buttons in front to put in the glass bottle, and would tie them up again, but she forgot to do it. She thought of it at that moment, and put the glass bottle back on her neck and buttoned them up as if to show off.\u2018Why did you behave so fastidiously alone, although it was hard to see my breasts even though I have released two buttons on my dress?\u2019But then the question of the Prince fell over Julietta\u2019s head, who was pouting at her mouth.\u201cIs it genetic to have such a dark face?\u201dKillian asked what he had been curious about, pretending not to see that her tiny eyes of buttonhole size looking at him secretly over the thick glasses, as if she didn\u2019t like him. His judgment was unusually generous, because such an appearance was far better than those stupid girls who were smitten and drooled at him as if they were looking at delicious food.Julietta applied the juice of metum fruit from her face to her neck so that it would not show any difference in color, but she left her hands alone. It was useless to apply the juice to what was hidden under her clothes, and her hands needed to touch water from time to time.The Prince\u2019s question was something people always wondered about when they looked at her white hands, so Julietta was able to answer naturally enough that she had a skin problem.\u201cWhen I was a kid, I had terrible pain after eating the wrong food, and my skin has been this way since I had a rash on my face.\u201dKillian picked up the documents that were sitting next to him after he resolved his curiosity and learned why the color of her face and other white clavicles was like that. The maid in front of him was amazing, but he wasn\u2019t interested for long.\u2014\u2014It was a moment before Killian, who had been looking over the documents in a sore manner for a long time, looked up to take a short rest for his stiff neck and legs.He saw the maid dozing carelessly before his eyes. It didn\u2019t matter much, because even Jeff only pretended not to doze off when he was looking at the documents, but Killian, who was strangely irritated, put his long legs up next to the seat where the maid was sitting.When the tension eased, Julietta, who had been dozing off at the quiet surroundings and fatigue without realizing it, woke up in fright. If she was caught dozing off, she would be scolded. She pretended not to have slept, and looked at the Prince with glaring eyes, but he shook his slim legs as he leaned leisurely over the seat.\u201cI\u2019ve been sitting here for a long time, and my legs are numb. If I had had Jeff, he\u2019d have given me a massage before I could tell him. Due to someone, Jeff is not next to me now, so the person directly involved should take responsibility, right?\u201dJulietta raised her head to glimpse the Prince, who told her off, knowing if he ordered a massage it would be done. However, as soon as she met his gaze, she lowered her eyes. Having brought her hands to his leg as politely as possible, Julietta began massaging with as much force as she could with her fingers.\u201cI said my legs. I didn\u2019t tell you to do a massage on my ankle.\u201dFor five minutes, she couldn\u2019t go up more than that, and only massaged his ankles, the Prince\u2019s laughter fell on her. Julietta, who forced her hands to reach out to his calves, used all the strength she could muster as much as possible as if for revenge. In contrast to her intentions, Killian satisfactorily closed his eyes, feeling the coolness as the tight muscles were loosened.\u201cNow that it\u2019s okay there, massage my thighs.\u201dJulietta\u2019s hands went up at the Prince\u2019s command.\u201cMore up.\u201d\u201cWhere do you mean above?\u201dFind authorized novels in ReadNovelFull\uff0cfaster updates, better experience\uff0cPlease click www.ReadNovelFull.com for visiting.Killian, who pretended not to know and put her hands of Julietta who refused to go further then his knees on the middle of his thighs, closed his eyes again and ordered.\u201cDon\u2019t pinch, give a hard massage. Up, up, up, more.\u201dJulietta, who wanted to feed a fist potato to the Prince who kept asking for more, once again engraved \u201cThe order has to be done right away\u201d in her head, and began to touch him as far as she could possibly reach.As she was rubbing his strong thighs, the Prince breathed out normally, even though he had already fallen asleep. When Julietta, finally freed from hard labor, gently took her hands off, the ghostly-eyed Prince ordered her to continue in a sleep-deprived voice.By the time Julietta\u2019s sighs grew louder and louder because of the Prince\u2019s command to continue, and her hands were ready to fall off, he had fallen asleep, and the carriage finally stopped.\u201cYour Highness, we\u2019ve arrived at the sleeping quarters today\u2026\u201dSir Albert, who was about to climb up the carriage opening the door, was at a loss when he saw the maid massaging the Prince\u2019s thigh.\u201cDid we arrive?\u201dWhether the carriage stopped or not, Killian, who was left his thigh in Julietta\u2019s hands, stared nonchalantly at Sir Albert, whose eyes were about to pop out from astonishment.\u201cWhat? Yes, yes\u2026 Your Highness.\u201d\u201cYou answer me once, I understand.\u201dIf he couldn\u2019t even see Sir Albert\u2019s bewildered image, Killian lowered the legs that he had put on the other seat, stretched himself and gracefully stepped down from the carriage.\u201cIs that an inn over there?\u201d\u201cYes, Your Highness.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Killian made a bluff as if he noticed Sir Albert\u2019s idea.\u201cIf this trip fails to prevent me being disturbed by Count Baden, you will really have to be ready for retirement.\u201dSir Albert, who had been trained a butler and the grand chamberlain since he was a child, pretended not to hear the words the Prince often uttered, and opened his mouth to help him understand his plight. \u201cBut, Your Highness, since the noble royal family has visited, you have to understand the mind of the Count coming to say hello\u2026\u201d\u201cStop. I\u2019m willing to give a hundred concessions if he comes with his true heart, but I can\u2019t forgive him for saying that they are proofs of loyalty, from his first daughter to the youngest, who has never even started her first monthly period.\u201dAlbert kept his mouth shut when he tried to complain, thinking about what had happened when they had been on their way to the Principality of Bertino last time.\u201cHow about Jeff?\u201d\u201cThe burns on the chin and neck are very painful. I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll be able to serve you for the time being, so my private servant will have to serve you. Will you be okay?\u201d\u201cWhat for? Why should I use your servant when I have my own maid? Tell her to hurry up and make ready a bath.\u201d\u201cAre you serious, Your Highness?\u201d\u201cDo I look like I\u2019m playing a joke?\u201d\u201cBut, but\u2026\u201d Albert looked back at the maid from Bertino mansion who he hastily procured, as the Prince walked away without looking back.Julietta, who had been waiting quietly by Sir Albert\u2019s side after getting off the wagon, was struck by the words to prepare a bath coming from the mouth of the Prince. Sir Albert\u2019s order came as she tried to stand there, pretending not to know, and she wanted to believe that it would not be what she thought it was.\u201cWhat are you doing? Why don\u2019t you go up there right now to prepare His Highness\u2019s bath?!\u201d At Sir Albert\u2019s shout, Julietta again grumbled at Manny, who had sent her to this country.\u2018No, should I curse the Prince, who must drink tea in the carriage?\u2019After sincerely cursing them both, she quickly adapted to the reality as usual.\u2018I haven\u2019t even seen him once or twice, so there\u2019s nothing to do with him. Yeah, it\u2019s not a big deal. It\u2019s nothing. I\u2019m just helping him take a bath. Julietta, you are the maid of Prince Bertino. You\u2019re a professional woman. Be proud of your work as a professional.\u2019Again self-sufficient, Julietta looked back at Sir Albert.\u201cMr. Grand Chamberlain, are you looking for a new maid? And when will Jeff get better?\u201d\u201cWell, it is said that Mrs. Auguste is eagerly seeking a maid now, so she will follow if she is hired. I am actually not sure about Jeff. The burns are not a problem, but the problem is his broken leg when he fell off the wagon while he flung himself about in pain during the first aid. On all occasions, he rolled in front of a knight\u2019s horse and was kicked, and his injury is so serious. The doctor advised him to go to Vicern and get a sacred treatment. I\u2019m going to ask the Prince if he wants to get a new servant again or wait until Jeff returns, because even if he gets a sacred treatment, he\u2019ll have to be stable for a few months.\u201dJulietta\u2019s shoulders drooped. It seemed like there was no way out of this gloomy reality for the time being. Who knew a cup of hot tea would cause such a big accident? All she could hope for was a quick hiring of the new maid and a quick return to the cozy Harrods Street.She wriggled up the stairs to the second floor, sad at her misfortune, her steps forced and heavy.After a while, Julietta, standing in the bathroom, looked hopelessly down at the steaming tub and prayed for the time to come.She sprinkled the bath powder the Prince loved so much with hope, but it was different from the one Julietta knew, and the bubbles didn\u2019t happen at all. The clear, still water was silent. Julietta, who wanted to hide the Prince\u2019s naked body with a lot of foam, was frustrated.The refreshing scent of the bath powder, reminiscent of a green forest, was so thick and heavy that Julietta wanted to hold her nose, to such an extent as to expose an empty floor. Her head ached with the terrible smell of the bathroom, but it didn\u2019t matter to her.In the bedroom, even though the Prince was walking around naked, if she avoided eye contact, it would have been possible. But now there was no way to avoid it.\u2018I have to help the Prince to take a bath in this small room, how can I avoid it?\u2019It was impossible to do with a sober mind. She would rather endure this time in a dazed state of mind under this strong, stinky bath powder. If he scolded her, she was going to beg him, \u201cI didn\u2019t know because it was the first time.\u201dSnap. At last the hour of fate had come. The tired Prince who had been waiting for the notice that it was ready came in through the door.\u201cWhat the hell! Why does it take so long to prepare a bath\u2026? What the hell is this smell?\u201dHer face showed signs of hope, even as she feared she would be scolded, when Killian hated the smell in the bathroom.\u201cYour Highness, I\u2019m sorry. My hands slipped and I spilled too much bath powder. It smells awful. Why don\u2019t you wash your hands and feet today and take a bath tomorrow?\u201dJulietta, who held back what she wanted to say, \u2018Because you didn\u2019t move in the carriage anyway, you did not sweat,\u2019 asked him softly, but the Prince simply ordered without pretending to be listening, \u201cBring the bathtub out.\u201dAs expected, if it was inevitable anyway, she had to adapt nicely. Even if she avoided it today, it would be tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, and if she avoided the fire that fell in front of her eyes, there would be all the more urgent things to do. As it was not worthwhile that she deliberately poured too much bath powder, and it happened that the bathtub should be dragged out, Julietta truly regretted it.She secretly looked sideways at the Prince standing with his arms crossed, then opened the door to the corridor and spoke to the knights guarding the entrance.\u201cWell, knights, I\u2019m sorry. His Highness needs a bath, and can you move the bathtub to the living room?\u201dWhen they went to call the servants who were doing chores, they didn\u2019t know what else to hear before the water cooled down, so the knights were displeased with her as soon as they saw her, but she had to say sorry things to them. Her scary face was so flustered that she managed to speak out, but the knights turned their heads in silence.\u201cHow much longer do I have to wait to take a bath now?\u201dFind authorized novels in ReadNovelFull\uff0cfaster updates, better experience\uff0cPlease click www.ReadNovelFull.com for visiting.As soon as the Prince\u2019s disgruntled call came out of the bathroom, whether he knew the situation outside or not, the knights who pretended not to hear rushed into the room. Julietta pouted as she watched the knights put down the huge bathtub in front of the frowning Prince who walked out to the living room, her arms folded. This was the way things were supposed to be, he was this cheap.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The Principality Of Bertino, Part VITranslator: KhanEditor: AelryinthJulietta gave a sigh of relief before the knights, who stared at her while leaving the room after putting down the bathtub.\u201cClothes!\u201dAs soon as the Prince\u2019s command was issued, regardless of her mood, Julietta ran up beside him like lightning.Undressing that noble body standing tall like a mountain, Julietta was overwhelmed by tension and had difficulty swallowing. If she did something wrong, she would be labeled a pervert.Fortunately, the Prince, who had a scowl on his face, as if he hadn\u2019t noticed her condition, entered the bathtub as soon as his clothes were removed, and let out a satisfying sigh.Julietta picked up the bath sponge, being careful not to turn her eyes to the bathtub that boasted water far too clear.Killian had been smiling at the maid, whose face had turned sour and had her eyes tightly closed, waving a sponge like a weapon. It was hilarious to see her wielding a sponge desperately, whether or not water splashed on her clothes, which she was still wearing even though the steam was fogging up her glasses from the hot water of the bathtub. Killian leaned back in the bathtub, watching the funny sight.The roles of the servants and maids at his side were precisely separated. It was the job of the male servant to hand over his body or take a bath for him or attend to his clothes, and of the maid to prepare tea, wait on for meals, and to host guests.One day, at a sensitive time as he moved from boy to young man, a woman in charge of caring for him carried out a senseless act of groping, casting an amorous glance at him. That unpleasantness was a secret that only he and Albert knew, and was the cause of the least annoying maid in his own mind being fired.Regardless of the other person\u2019s feelings, the women who were always trying to cling to and rush him to have sex were just abominable abusers. He knew better than anyone else how he felt when he was subjected to unwanted actions by an unwanted person, so even if he had the status of the royal family, he had neither forced nor decided to force himself on a woman.There was only one criterion for him to choose a woman: a mature relationship that was not burdensome to each other, and the rationality of breaking up when one of them asked for more or wanted more.The women who became his lovers were not chosen for their appearance. He only chose a woman who was the least active among those who hovered around him and sought opportunities and promised not to ask for his love and future.Such a Killian, however, was snickering, while giving an order to bathe him to the maid in front of him.This maid was very unusual from the start. She was so rude that he could never find any respect for her master, and indifferent with no interest in his status as the royal family and his handsome face.In addition, contrary to Albert\u2019s recommendation that she was sincere and prudent, she secretly displayed her emotions whenever he ordered her to do something she didn\u2019t want to do, and tried to avoid doing it whenever she could. Her grumpy face made him do this, but Killian was not offended at all and felt good.\u2018When does she surrender when she can\u2019t do it? Let\u2019s see what would happen,\u2019 he thought and gave himself to her, but suddenly, he felt a touch at an important place.\u201cHuck, Your Highness. It\u2019s a mistake. I didn\u2019t mean it at all. Please forgive me.\u201dJulietta was able to wash her employer\u2019s hair and wipe off his wide, muscular back and even his solid chest. But the problem was what came next. The belly hard as a stone was done anyway, but she couldn\u2019t even think of going below.Until now, the arrogant Prince managed to keep his mouth shut, but the water was getting colder. Unable to hesitate more, Julietta closed her eyes and rubbed the sponge with a frantic pace.She had a feeling. She felt like she touched something important. It didn\u2019t matter how much Jeff wiped. She touched something she could never intrude on.Killian\u2019s mouth turned sour after the woman made a fuss, in the way, \u201cI touched the dirtiest thing in the world.\u201d He thought he\u2019d stop at this point, but he changed his mind. What a hateful face!\u201cForgiveness? You\u2019re saying something funny things. Of course, it\u2019s where you need to clean it up. Come on, hurry up. The water got cold.\u201dKillian\u2019s words hardened Julietta\u2019s resolution.\u2018Yeah, you know. It\u2019s inevitable. It\u2019s what you have to do, as long as you get double your salary and various bonuses. Now, the man before you is not a man. It\u2019s your future, someone who pays for your debt and your freedom. You can do it\u2026 but I can\u2019t.\u2019\u201cGive me the sponge and go down and bring me dinner. If I wait for you to wipe it off, It won\u2019t be finished by tomorrow morning.\u201dWhen she looked blue and white, as if she was going to die, Killian allowed her to stop, because he was afraid his maid would stop breathing.As soon as that happened, her dying face lit up. The maid still held out a sponge to him, her eyes tightly closed, with an air of worldly politeness.\u201cI\u2019ll get your meal as soon as I can. Your Highness being hungry should not happen. I\u2019ll be back like lightning.\u201dWatching her escape with great joy without looking back at him, Killian thought very briefly about whether he would call her back.\u2014\u2014\u201cYour Highness, the Count insists that he will not step down until he says hello to you.\u201dAfter the dinner that the maid had brought back with her excitedly, Albert came to Killian, who was leisurely drinking tea in a gown.\u201cIs he here alone?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cSend him back.\u201d\u201cYour Highness, no matter how many times I say it to him, he ignores it. He\u2019s holding out on the ground floor right now, that he won\u2019t go back if he can\u2019t say hello.\u201d At his strong refusal, Albert said, \u201cThis old man has to sleep to travel tomorrow. Oops, my back!\u201dBut the Prince just looked unmoved, so he continued, \u201cI guess he still hasn\u2019t given up on that ambition after he was in such a fuss last year, and he\u2019s brought his daughters here to meet you. How can I defend against such a reckless intrusion?\u201dAt the sound of Albert\u2019s whining, Julietta muttered, unknowingly, a maxim, \u201cI heard an attack is the best defense.\u201dWhen Killian heard Julietta muttering, he looked at her with his eyes flashing. \u201cSay that again.\u201dWhen Killian responded to the muttering comment without realizing it, Julietta, who hesitated for a moment, opened her mouth, \u201cIf you only defend, it will get you through one day. Attack is the best defense. Before being invaded, this side should attack and remove that danger, that is the best. Though Your Highness doesn\u2019t like it, if he obstinately comes to you, it means that he has a purpose and he doesn\u2019t want to give it up until he achieves it. They say, \u2018Knock and the door will be opened to you.\u2019 So if you don\u2019t want to get caught up in something you don\u2019t want, wouldn\u2019t it be better if you never let him do it again?\u201dJulietta, who said what she thought of herself, as if she did not hesitate, hurried to bow her head, as she thought, \u2018My Goodness!\u2019Killian looked at her carefully and buried himself on the sofa. As he opened his mouth to say something, there was suddenly an uproar outside.\u201cYour Highness, Henry Archibald Baden came up here in spite of his rudeness to greet you. Please allow me to come in and grant me the honor to see you.\u201dFind authorized novels in ReadNovelFull\uff0cfaster updates, better experience\uff0cPlease click www.ReadNovelFull.com for visiting.When Baden\u2019s voice was heard from outside, Killian stopped what he was going to say, jumped up and went into the inner room and sat on the bed. And after beckoning Albert and Julietta, staring dazed at him, he whispered as they approached. \u201cI fell asleep because I was tired from a while ago. He wouldn\u2019t dare say hello to me by waking me up. If he wants to see me sleeping, say, \u2018No one is allowed in without His Highness\u2019s permission, and it is treason to disobey his orders.\u2019 Stressing that, take the Count downstairs.\u201dAt Killian\u2019s words, Albert nodded reluctantly with a crying look.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

No matter how she would sleep on the floor, the pressure of sleeping with the Prince in this small room made Julietta\u2019s words of protest pop out of her mouth.\u201cI can sleep in the living room.\u201dHe would not order Julietta to sleep on the bedside floor for herself, but she rebelled with an air of innocence. Killian, however, added another word to Albert, as he didn\u2019t hear her, \u201cGet out of here right away, and I don\u2019t need an escort in front of my room today, so leave it empty.\u201d\u201cYour Highness, it is absurd. I can\u2019t believe you ordered the escorts away. What if someone breaks in?\u201dAlbert jumped out of his skin, but Killian threw off his gown with force, put on his pants and shirt again, and went onto the bed.\u201cI have a strong maid. Don\u2019t worry. She is going to protect me even by blocking everyone.\u201d\u201cIs it me?\u201d \u2018What is this, some kind of groundless confidence?\u2019When Julietta was dumbfounded by the clumsy words, Killian cleared it up, \u201cIf anything happens to me, I\u2019m sure the people under me won\u2019t be safe.\u201dJulietta immediately accepted. Quickly going out into the living room and picking up a couple of blankets on the sofa, she quietly laid the blanket that she had brought next to the bed where Killian lay.Albert shook his head pitifully at the sight of Julietta and went outside to carry out his orders.Julietta glanced at her employer\u2019s bed and thought for a moment whether to take off her heavy glasses. It had already been a few months since the wine incident, and he would not remember that very girl was herself, but she hesitated. If she was caught, she did not know what the perverse reaction of the Prince would be, who could not be called a good person.But it seemed more suspicious to sleep with her glasses on, and she lay down with them in her hands so she could don them at any time.As she lay in a blanket wearing an uncomfortable dress with wires in her waist and hips, the fire flared up from inside her. The more she thought about why she couldn\u2019t sleep well, the angrier she got.\u201cStop haggling and sleep. Or are you expecting something different?\u201d His low, colorful voice made Julietta look like she was asleep in one breath.\u2018I don\u2019t know why he doesn\u2019t hate or loathe my disguised appearance like everyone else.\u2019She was worried that the Prince was being generous, so she couldn\u2019t hide her mind from it, and that she might be shortening her life by making a big mistake.\u2014\u2014Killian sneaked out of bed as Julietta slowly fell asleep, trying to erase the ominous thought that he might run wild about taking a bath from tomorrow morning.\u2018What were you so angry about?\u2019She pretended to be asleep, but when he said something, she quickly fell asleep; it was cute. It was amazing that an unusual maid who he had never experienced had made him very happy on his boring trip.Killian thought he\u2019d better tell Albert tomorrow to stop finding a new maid.\u2018Where can I go and get a maid who hates me in this funny way?\u2019He was so happy that he thought he would make as much of what happened today as possible.\u2014Exactly two hours later, Killian realized that he had a very bad idea before.Count Baden\u2019s eldest daughter expected to come into his bed, and he was confident that he would be able to handle it neatly because he was in such a good mood today, but it was a big miscalculation.As he was cleaning the dagger, which had been left to him by his deceased grandfather, with the background of regular breathing, he heard the door to the drawing room leading to the hallway of the inn open.Thinking that she had finally arrived, Killian kicked the sleeping maid on the floor with the toes of his long legs. It was unforgivable that she even fell asleep before him, the Prince, but this dull maid never thought of waking up despite the urgent kick.While thinking about what to do, the bedroom door opened, and the shadow that had crept into it jumped into the bed and crushed his body before he even prepared his heart.According to his calculations, the woman had to trip over the maid in between as she walked into his bed. However, the obstacle was naturally cleared as Julietta stayed close to the bed to avoid his kick.It was never a good feeling to be suddenly laid down on by someone who came in the middle of the night. His generosity, which was rarely seen, today hit the bottom in a moment.Killian grabbed the impudent woman\u2019s collar and threw her out of his bed with no mercy. A scream burst out of the mouth of a woman who fell to the floor, and at the same time, the maid who was sleeping rose in bewilderment.\u201cWhat, what sound is this?\u201dA bewildered Julietta looked around the dark room, and the Prince\u2019s cold order fell, \u201cTurn on the light.\u201dThe Prince\u2019s gloomy voice, which seemed to signal \u2018You\u2019re dead now,\u2019 was so cold that her heart leapt into her throat. As soon as she turned on the magic light after hurrying to don the glasses she had not lost even during her surprise, she could see a woman with torn clothes around her neck lying down.The gloomy atmosphere grew more sullen as Julietta looked at her employer with suspicious eyes.Find authorized novels in ReadNovelFull\uff0cfaster updates, better experience\uff0cPlease click www.ReadNovelFull.com for visiting.\u201cWhat is that look in your eyes? Get rid of that woman right now!\u201dAs the fierce look and voice that revealed that he was really angry, Julietta quickly approached the woman who had fallen down.\u201cWell, Lady, get a hold of yourself. Wake up. You can\u2019t lie here like this.\u201dShe shook the woman carefully, like waking up a drunken man lying on the street, but the woman never thought of waking up. She was agonizing for a moment about how to wake up, and felt a chill in her spine.As she sensed that the bomb\u2019s time was heading for zero, Julietta began to shake the woman strongly. She was sorry to shake her heartlessly, but it wasn\u2019t the time to overlook a woman\u2019s situation.She thought the woman, who was stretched out in a man\u2019s room in the middle of the night, was wrong, and shook her with all her might, and finally the corpse-like woman began to respond.\u201cUh, Ugh.\u201d She moaned as the woman woke up, as if the mind of Julietta in a snit was transmitted to her.\u2018What the hell had happened? And why was this woman lying here in this faint?\u2019Julietta just wanted her to get up before the bomb went off. When she looked at the Prince with anxious eyes and wondering how long he would wait, the woman finally opened her eyes.\u201cWhere, where am I\u2026?\u201dThe woman, who was groaning with her head on her head, suddenly raised her head. She pushed Julietta and ran to the Prince.\u201cYour Highness, I had to come here to see you like this. Please give me a hug.\u201dNow she seemed to be completely out of touch with the expression of the Prince and the atmosphere in the room. While she was agonizing over whether she should stop the woman who firmly clung to him, she was hanging on his shoulders and pulling down her thin pajamas.The woman began to cry pitifully when her plump bare chest was exposed. When the Prince looked down at the scene without saying a word, Julietta slowly stepped back, thinking that it was an atmosphere that she had to retreat.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The Principality Of Bertino, Part VIIITranslator: KhanEditor: Aelryinth\u201cWhat are you doing? Send her out of here right now! And get Albert!\u201dAt the cold voice, Julietta hurried up to the woman. The moment she pulled her arm, telling her to get up, her glasses flew away, and her face burned in a flash.Ouch. She was hit again. Because of the Prince\u2019s women, who hit her on the cheek as if she were a neighborhood punching bag, Julietta had to think for a moment about this job.The moment she reflexively ran to pick up the stripped glasses first, she heard a dull sound of \u2018thud.\u2019 As soon as she looked back with glasses, she saw a wistfully crying woman rolling to the door.\u201cDo not think that I would overlook that since you are a woman. How dare you sneak into my sleeping room and even touch my maid? You went crazy to die. Isn\u2019t that right? Isn\u2019t there anyone there?\u201dKillian, who kicked her coldly in anger at the beating of his own maid, shouted. The outside was disturbed by a shout which was different from the previous one. The guards rushed in and out of the other room, and after a while Sir Albert, who was dressed up in pajamas, came in.\u201cYour, Your Highness?\u201dAlbert was appalled at the sight of the Prince, who aimed the dagger, a treasure of family of Bertino, at the woman who was lying down.\u201cWhere\u2019s Count Baden? Did he go back to his castle?\u201d\u201cOh, no. He said he would see Your Highness in the morning, and he rented a room at the inn.\u201d\u201cThe whole family that he brought must have rooms in the inn. I told the inn owner not to accept any guests while I am staying. Did you tell the Count that it was treason to break my orders?\u201d\u201cYes, Your Highness.\u201d\u201cIn the late night, sneaking into the room of a potential crown prince must have been a scheme to assassinate me by holding hands with someone. Arrest all those who are staying at the inn, except our party.\u201dAlbert opened his eyes to the growing task.When the Prince said about treason earlier, he thought it was about scaring him to take off the annoying Count Baden. But he ordered him to arrest all of them with a straight face. Once angry, he was in that state where no one could stop him; he felt that now and became uneasy.Soon, Count Baden and his companions were arrested and dragged in front of Killian, whose cold silver eyes glistened. The Count waited for good news and looked sulky with anger at the sudden turmoil.\u201cThe Count, your daughter secretly attacked me this night to assassinate me. When did you start with this plan?\u201dCount Baden protested in a fit of rage when he accused his daughter, who he had sent to seduce, of being an assassin. \u201cYour Highness, what an assassination! I don\u2019t even think about it. It\u2019s just an immature act my daughter committed in love for you. Since she saw you last year, she\u2019s been lovesick and divorced. Please forgive her for the crazy thing that stupid child has done for love.\u201dThe Count laughed inwardly, asking for forgiveness with a somewhat frightened look. However, he felt bad knowing that the Prince should have done this as he pushed his daughter into the room even after last year. He stared at his foolish daughter, who had failed to lure a man and brought him to such disgrace.Killian\u2019s derision was heard in the ears of Count Baden, who only thought of stepping down after giving the proper measure in tune.\u201cCount Baden, I haven\u2019t been letting you go because I did not know. Don\u2019t you think I knew you were weighing between me and Francis? Why, if I accept your daughter today, will you betray Francis?\u201dThe Count\u2019s face hardened as the Prince stared at him touching a sharp knife.Francis, the first Prince, was the most likely figure to rise to the crown prince, with Killian, the fifth Prince, now in sight. Unlike Killian, who seemed to be little interested in the crown prince\u2019s position, Prince Francis was actively expanding his influence. Between Francis and Killian, supported by the Emperor, the nobles were looking where to put their feet, and so was Count Baden.Last year, the family of Duke Dudley, the mother\u2019s side of the family of Francis, sent a man to the Count who had been disgraced for pushing his daughter into Killian.Currently, the number one family in the aristocratic hierarchy in Austern with no Empress, was the family of Duke Dudley, of the Empress. At such a gesture from the great nobility, the Count had no choice but to be moved. It was now possible for him to enter the central aristocracy, which he had aspired to for so long.Four hundred years ago, the current balance of power was enacted when the long war ended and meetings between countries began regularly. Thus, at a time when a mutual non-aggression treaty was signed and war was gone between countries, the status of a margrave was nothing more than a nobleman who failed to advance to the center, or another such a title.Baden Territory was a city with commercial development because of its geographical characteristics. It was one of the important channels of foreign trade.Unlike the two Empires, who set up direct-connected Magic Squares under mutual consultation, the kingdoms had to cross the borders by land. In order for goods from other countries to go to the Principality of Bertino, the Kingdom of Shurant, and the Kingdom of Levatum, they had to cross the border after taking the Magic Square. Count Baden, who had amassed wealth in accordance with geographical advantages as a key location, had always been thirsty for advancing to the center.Though they were the same country, the central aristocrats completely ostracized the local aristocrats.History had shown that the family of Kielini of neighboring Tilia Territory had made a great contribution to the reform of the kingdom of Austern to the Austern Empire, through war. The reward led the family of Kielini to produce the Empress, and quickly widened the gap with the family of Baden.Count Baden, who had always envied the family of Kielini, now one of Austern\u2019s top aristocrats, decided to take advantage of their way of gaining status, and had been steadily trying to push his daughters into the fifth Prince when passing Baden Territory to go to the Principality of Bertino this time of year.Count Baden once again examined Killian\u2019s gaze, who was staring at him with fierce eyes.The image of the Prince staring at him with his arms crossed seemed so severe that no needle would go in.He was nervous because he thought that it would not be possible for him to have a chance if the restoration of the broken Magic Square of Bertino was completed, and he had not been able to get a proper chance since the fifth Prince had not given him any opportunity.Find authorized novels in ReadNovelFull\uff0cfaster updates, better experience\uff0cPlease click www.ReadNovelFull.com for visiting.While he was agonizing that the opportunity for him to turn Austern\u2019s royal family into his in-laws would be his last, the family of Duke Dudley approached him.Count Baden began to roll his head. His instincts informed him that he should board the fifth Prince\u2019s boat, but could not give up the connection to Duke Dudley. The Count, who had decided to send his daughter again today as his last chance, had allowed the followers of the Duke to stay in the castle for weeks in case he failed.Although he thought that the Prince in front of him would not know all this, the words of the Prince hit the mark. The Count\u2019s face had lost all color.\u201cDid you think I wouldn\u2019t know? The Count, you don\u2019t know me too much. Can\u2019t you avoid the sight of His Majesty? You are so stupid,\u201d the fifth Prince said with confidence that the Emperor had his back. It was like he was proclaiming himself to be the next Emperor.\u201cNow do you know how big a mistake you\u2019ve made? I have warned you so many times and overlooked your actions, but you sent your daughter to sneak into my room. How dare she hit my maid?\u201dPeople tilted their heads in unison as some seemingly divergent words came from the mouth of the Prince, who had a very cool, great-looking, unapproachable aura. Silence sank in the room as everyone thought hard to figure out the truth about the Prince\u2019s words.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The Principality Of Bertino, Part IXTranslator: KhanEditor: AelryinthHe was obviously very angry, but the reason was somehow puzzling. Feeling more angry about the maid being hit than when his esteemed daughter came in the middle of the night, the eyes of the knights who had ignored Julietta carefully turned to her in the corner.Her hair stretched out in all directions like a broom since she was awakened from sleep, and the glasses that had been flown away and bent as she had been beaten were hanging badly on her face. Moreover, it seemed that she had slept without washing and grease oozed off of her face, and she was too miserable to look at.The knights, who persuaded themselves by force that the Prince cherished her because she did her job well, firmly decided to be careful in the future. They could not understand the Prince\u2019s tastes after keeping Jeff, who was so arrogant, at his side. Those who gave up understanding today also decided to keep silent and watch the current situation.\u201cYour Highness, are you mad at me for only one maid? My daughter wouldn\u2019t hit her for no reason, and even if she did, she would be of a different identity. She looks like a commoner, but it\u2019s embarrassing to see that you are so angry that a daughter of the family of Baden hit a common lady.\u201dKillian\u2019s perfect eyebrows, which were sharply raised by the Count\u2019s words, stretched further, not knowing how high the sky was.\u201cWhat did you say now? She can hit her for no reason? And she\u2019s a commoner, so can she hit her? How dare she hit my maid? You think you can beat a maid who serves the royal family because she\u2019s a commoner? Count Baden, are you rebelling against me?\u201dHe poured oil on the fire. He had been in the worst mood for days, but he seemed even more upset by his strangely dismissive remarks about the maid he liked. Albert looked unknowingly at the maid crushed in the corner.\u2018What kind of skill did she please the Prince with?\u2019\u201cYour Highness, since it\u2019s late at night, why don\u2019t you go to bed and decide tomorrow what to do with Count Baden? We have to leave early in the morning, and I think the knights or the servants and maids will only sleep for a little while if they rest now.\u201dEventually, when Albert hinted that he wanted to go and sleep, Killian stealthily looked at Julietta and returned to the place.\u201cOkay. Let\u2019s stop for today. Count Baden and his family must be returned to the castle and locked up. I\u2019m not going to let go that they looked down on me, so I\u2019ll punish them for violating my orders before I leave tomorrow and for not showing any signs of remorse for daring to hit my maid.\u201dThe Prince\u2019s words made Count Baden\u2019s heart flutter. His daughter was shaking like that, naked and shivering, and he belatedly noticed that the Prince was so angry that he was jumping up and down. He couldn\u2019t bear to say what was in his heart, seeing that his daughter being treated like a sinner, as if she had sinned to death for hitting a maid.\u201cYour Highness, forgive me. My daughter snuck into your room, just because she was so fond of you, as I said before\u2026 I think she was embarrassed when she hit her. In no way, it\u2019s not because she tried to harm you or because she ignored your maid.\u201d The Count belatedly uttered an apology to settle the matter, but the Prince only snorted.\u201cThe Count, you can be arrogant as much as you want, because you have a better identity, title, and power than others. But that arrogance and insolence should also go down according to a person. All the words and doing of my men are just what I say and do. But the Count and your daughter never accepted any of my words. How can I let it go, overlooking this? Why should I? There\u2019s no way it won\u2019t happen again.\u201dAt the Prince\u2019s words, Count Baden quickly pleaded, \u201cYour Highness, just give me a chance. I will take care not to disturb your spirits with this kind of thing again. Forgive me for the foolishness of a stupid father who could not resist the pleas of a daughter who loves you.\u201dKillian unwillingly considered the Count, who was earnestly kowtowing and appealing with overflowing, fatherly affection imitating a friendly father\u2019s image. \u201cAll right, Apologize. Then I\u2019ll forgive you one last time.\u201d\u201cYes, Your Highness. I\u2019m so sorry.

Not to me. Apologize to my maid.\u201d\u201cPardon me?\u201d\u201cYour daughter hit her, so ask her to apologize to my maid. Look at that. She was badly hit like that and she is in such a mess.\u201dKillian\u2019s words brought everyone\u2019s gaze to the maid in the corner of the room. Embarrassed at the gaze, Julietta unknowingly shrank back into the corner. When Killian stared at his daughter in torn clothes, regardless of the attention of the people who wanted to talk that she had originally been in such a mess, the Count protested in dismay, \u201cYour Highness, it doesn\u2019t make sense to apologize to a maid.\u201dThe Count\u2019s voice rose like it was when he apologized, a miserable scowl on his face.\u201cLook, you\u2019re not reflecting on it at all. The Count\u2019s arrogance must be worse than mine. Albert, do you think I should forgive Count Baden?\u201dAt Killian\u2019s words, Albert shook his head helplessly.\u201cIt\u2019s a pity that Count Baden doesn\u2019t seem to appreciate your generosity. I don\u2019t think any more forgiveness means anything.\u201d\u2018If it doesn\u2019t go according to the master\u2019s mind anyway, the meaningless war of words won\u2019t end even after a few nights.\u2019Now his master was very angry at the maid being hit. Judging from his master\u2019s condition, it was clear that he would not go to bed until an apology came out of the mouth of his esteemed daughter. So, in order to go and rest quickly, Albert was politely withdrawn, as he had always done. \u2018You\u2019re right about anything.\u2019At Albert\u2019s words, the eyes of people who looked at Julietta went to the very person behind the Count.Count Baden\u2019s daughter, Serenne, was dumbfounded and about to cry. She had been thrown and kicked by the Prince, and stood there with her clothes torn. About her regard, there were no words at all, but she was treated as if she had committed a capital crime for hitting a lowly maid?\u2018Why should I apologize when I only have sinned to fall in love with the Prince, and stopped the woman who tried to pull me away before achieving my purpose?\u2019When Serenne closed her mouth and turned her head, the Prince\u2019s eyes became more and more intense.\u201cThe Count and his daughter don\u2019t seem to want to apologize, so there\u2019s no room for forgiveness. Take them away.\u201d\u201cI, I\u2019m sorry.\u201dAs soon as the Prince\u2019s cold order was issued, words of apology, which seemed to have been squeezed out of the lips of the scruffy Serenne, came out. Even though she said she was sorry, it didn\u2019t change the Prince\u2019s expression, as if that wasn\u2019t enough, so Serenne was forced to shed tears and say sorry again to the shabby, ugly maid, \u201cI\u2019m so, so sorry. My hands were raised in fear of being dragged out in front of Your Highness. Forgive me.\u201dAs soon as Serenne\u2019s words were finished, a very satisfying smile came to his face. But Julietta, who had just received the apology, was at a loss what to do.\u201cThat\u2019s great. Now that you said this would never happen again, and your daughter has apologized like this, I\u2019ll forgive you for what you\u2019ve done today.\u201dSeeing him laughing broadly as if he had done them a kindness, they hurriedly stepped down, saying goodnight to each other with the thought that they might be found fault with.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He didn\u2019t think of going into the bedroom, but was sitting on the couch in the living room, so she felt like she was going to die.\u201cIf you take off those glasses, can\u2019t you see anything in front of you?\u201d Killian asked, looking wonderfully at the way she had pushed her crooked glasses on the back of her nose.\u201cNot at all.

Without realizing it, said Killian, with a feeling of sympathy.\u201cWhen I get to Bertino, I\u2019ll get you some of the finest glasses. The capital of the Principality, Ricaren, has a skillful dwarf and a wizard. They could make a pair of glasses that are better than those ugly ones, that are highly efficient and that look incomparable.\u201dJulietta shook her hands in amazement at Killian\u2019s useless meddlesome.\u201cNo, Your Highness. Glasses will not be a problem with wearing them if the temples of the glasses are repaired. I\u2019m going to go to the blacksmith\u2019s shop early tomorrow morning. You don\u2019t have to worry.\u201dWith a freaking look, Killian was even more satisfied with her smile. How perfect it was to be a maid who hated him and had no appetite for worldly desires. Whenever the merits of this new maid were increasingly revealed, he felt very good.After refusing the spectacularly expensive glasses, the Prince, who strangely became friendly, took off his clothes and went into the bed naked. Julietta tried to leave the bedroom with the blanket on the floor. Then the Prince stopped her urgently.\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\u201cI think I can sleep in the living room because we don\u2019t have any more guests who will visit.\u201dThe atmosphere of the bedroom, which was so soft, froze as soon as her words came over.\u201cWhere did you get the confidence that no other assassin would ever come in? Stop complaining and try to sleep by my bed every night.\u201dJulieta was so dizzy and complained to herself when he said she had to do this every day.\u201cYour Highness, the knights outside will keep you safe, rather than the dull, blind maid. If you\u2019re worried about an assassin sneaking in, do I call the knights to come in?\u201d\u201cAre you talking to me about sleeping with a guy in the bedroom? It\u2019s not even worth trying to convince me, so don\u2019t bring it up.\u201dAt his strong rejection, Julietta laid a blanket on the floor next to his bed, biting the bullet.\u201cCan you sleep in that thick dress? If you\u2019re having the wrong idea that I might do something about you, put away that delusion and change into your pajamas at ease.\u201dShe didn\u2019t know why he was so meddlesome about her looks. Julietta wanted to say to him, \u2018I have to sleep in such uncomfortable clothes because of you,\u2019 but she could not do that, and just turned her back to him while on the floor, and complained irritatedly, \u201cI\u2019ve never had anything called pajamas. So, don\u2019t worry, but just go to sleep please.\u201d\u2014\u2014The next day, Julietta satisfactorily walked out of the blacksmith\u2019s workshop with her glasses that found its shape. She didn\u2019t want to wear heavy glasses yet, so she put them on and walked slowly through the village, which began to bustle in the morning.The village, boasting colorful roofs, was quite busy and lively for a town far from the capital. Perhaps Count Baden, whom she had seen yesterday, was not such a bad lord, so Julietta decided to take a short walk to slow down her return to the inn.It was a precious time to get away from the Prince, who sat haughtily in a bathtub boasting clean water this morning. She pretended to be as pathetic as she could, and to be careful not to stare at him. When asked if she could go to the blacksmith\u2019s workshop to fix her glasses before leaving, the Prince, who had not been speaking for a long time, reluctantly allowed her to go and she ran away without looking back as soon as she could.\u2018Must I go back in a hurry and get the Prince\u2019s breakfast?\u2019However, her steps gradually slowed down, mesmerized by the clear, high sky, the chatter of the birds and the lively appearance of the merchants opening their shops in the morning.When she saw a spicy smelly bakery among the shops lined up on the street, Julietta bought two loaves of freshly baked white bread.She felt as if she had become a Parisian, busy going to work wearing baguettes, tearing the bread into her hands and putting it in her mouth. She kept smiling sweetly, imagining herself not returning to the inn where the naked Prince was waiting, but as a professional secretary with a mean, but capable boss.It was a scene where she could not look pretty as Julietta\u2019s bulging skirt with wire fluttered unbecomingly to a large size. There was such a look at her from afar.Unaware that a silver-haired middle-aged nobleman and a man, who seemed to be his servant in a luxury carriage, were watching her closely, Julietta headed for the inn with a joyous step at the first freedom she had in a while.\u2014\u2014Meanwhile, Albert was suspicious of his ears when he heard some strange words.\u201cYour Highness, would you say that again?\u201d\u201cBuy some pajamas for a maid.\u201d\u201cSuddenly pajamas?\u201dWhen Albert, who had been called in while checking the preparations for the departure, looked at him in astonishment, and Killian sidestepped the gaze.\u201cNo, it\u2019s unsanitary to sleep with the clothes she\u2019s been wearing all day outside. What if she gets sick? I don\u2019t have Jeff. Are you going to wait on me? For your information, you\u2019d better not even dream of putting your stupid servant on me.\u201dKillian kept talking, stopping Albert from saying what he meant.\u201cAnd pitifully, she\u2019s never had a pair of pajamas. How can I ignore her desire to try on her pajamas? As a generous owner, shouldn\u2019t I of course be able to grant her that much?\u201dJulietta never said that, but Killian, who interpreted it at his own convenience, looked at Albert as if he were seeking consent.\u201cI\u2019ll have the head maid ready a pair when I get to Ricaren.\u201d\u201cAlbert, she needs them tonight. Do you want her to be uncomfortable at night so she can\u2019t sleep, or be sick when she waits on me and makes a mistake? Or you can sleep with me.\u201dAt Killian\u2019s ridiculous challenge, Albert showed the white flag right away. He wondered who could stop what the prince had already decided to do so. If he decided to dress her in her pajamas, he had to bring her pajamas fit for her big body no matter what.\u2018I think the innkeeper\u2019s appearance I saw yesterday was similar to the size of the maid. I\u2019ll ask the hostess where to buy clothes and I\u2019ll get an answer.\u2019\u201cYes, Your Highness, I\u2019ll get some for her today.\u201d\u2014\u2014Albert, who would have slept on the floor while leaving a soft bed, got a pleasing answer from the owner.As soon as Julietta, wearing the finely repaired glasses, came back to the inn, the group set off again.Two hours after leaving the road, there was a maid in the carriage who sleeping with her mouth open carelessly.In a top-class carriage that was completely unshaken despite the bumpy forest road, the maid did not think of getting up even when he called, as if she had not slept that night. Killian\u2019s eyes suddenly narrowed as he stared at the drowsiness of the maid opposite him.He could see the straight forehead under the thick hair that stretched all over. Under the large glasses, that occupied half of her face, tiny lips opened and a pink little tongue was visible through them. He thought her lips were so cute, as if he had seen them somewhere.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It came up with the hideous pocket inside it.He thought of the fragrant tea and tried to wake her up again, but since she was sleeping so deeply he thought he\u2019d let it go.In the meantime, Killian, who had never thought of how generous he was, leaned over the sleeping maid and began unbuttoning the front of her dress. Even the third button was unbuttoned, he could not see her hideous pocket, if she had hidden the glass bottle so deep. But all of a sudden, he met two eyes staring at him.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat, what are you doing!\u201d Julietta hurriedly put up her glasses and shouted at the big man who was attacking her.\u201cWhat am I doing? I am taking out a glass bottle for tea. How dare you not wake up even if I call you, and then you yell at me? Do you want to die?\u201dWhen the frightened Killian got angry, Julietta became very polite.\u201cYour Highness, I can\u2019t help but be surprised when someone is taking off my clothes when I suddenly open my eyes. Please shake me to wake me up next time. Would you like some tea?\u201d\u201cTaking, taking your clothes? Who?\u201d\u201cYour Highness did it just now.\u201dKillian, who wafflingly stood up and stared at the saucy maid who questioned his own fault without saying that she would not sleep again, was discouraged by his uncomfortable posture.He plopped down on the chair and ordered curtly, \u201cMake me tea.\u201dSoon after, a fragrant tea was ready. Killian\u2019s eyes, drinking the tea, watched sharply beyond her thick glasses, but Julietta never noticed it as she put the expensive glass bottle back into her chest.\u2014\u2014\u201cYour Highness, we\u2019ve arrived at the inn for tonight.\u201dIn the late afternoon, earlier than expected, the party arrived at the next town. It was the result of not stopping, simply eating lunch with bread.When the Prince got out of the carriage and went into the inn, Julietta hurried along, holding up a box containing dizzying piles of papers and teacups.\u201cI\u2019ll hold this for you.\u201dJulietta walked into the inn with a small box that wasn\u2019t too heavy, and one of the Prince\u2019s escort knights took it with a warm smile.\u201cOh, that\u2019s okay.\u201d When asked to move the bathtub yesterday, he had stared at her. Julietta was embarrassed by the sudden kindness of a young knight, staring at him.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I want to help you.\u201d Gains was looking for a chance to look good, rather heartbroken about his mistreatment of the maid who seemed to be unusually trusted by the Prince.He escorted Prince Killian for months after he had been deployed to Asta Castle, a private dwelling place of Killian His Highness, but it was amazing to see the Prince, who had not given him a glance, encircling the maid. He had been so angry yesterday. He heard she had been in charge of the Prince\u2019s secret life in Bertino\u2019s private mansion, so she seemed to gain some favor.Gains, who wondered if he could be more comfortable in the future, even winking at her with a weapon of his handsome face and revealing his name to the ugly woman.\u201cI\u2019m Gains Bin Rieta, the second son of a Rieta. Your name?\u201dJulietta, looking unwillingly at the friendly knight with smiling eyes, replied reluctantly, \u201cIt\u2019s Julietta Salmon.\u201d\u201cCan I call you Julie? Your eyes are pretty. It\u2019s sad that such eyes are hidden.\u201dGains made a fuss, praising her small-looking eyes over the thick glasses. He thought the best way to get close to a woman, whether she was pretty or ugly, was to praise her appearance. At Gains\u2019 words, Julietta was startled and stepped back.\u201cYou won\u2019t be able to see my eyes properly because of my glasses.\u201d Julietta was very wary that he might have seen her walking around with her glasses off in the morning.He just laughed broadly and said, \u201cYes. I can\u2019t really see what color they are or what they look like. But when I look so close, they look pretty. I\u2019ve never seen small, ugly eyes like yours before, but I keep looking at them and they\u2019re cute.\u201dWhether it was a compliment or a curse, he was very popular with women, he looked so confident and put on airs, but she hated to see that. However, Julietta, who didn\u2019t want to get into his bad books on purpose, smiled and held out the box she was holding.Upon arriving at the inn, they were guided to a special room on the second floor. Killian smiled satisfactorily, thinking of the pajamas inside the package lying on the sofa. The more he thought about how much she\u2019d be touched by the first pajamas she could try on, the better he felt.He was pleased to think that this would deepen her loyalty to him, but the main character who would receive the nightgown was nowhere to be seen. Killian, who had been waiting for Julieta to come up, pressed Albert as soon as he entered the living room.\u201cHow the hell long do I have to wait?\u201dAlbert was quick to look around after the sudden attack of Killian. Julietta had to come and wait on him instead of himself, who had arrived late to prepare the Prince\u2019s dinner, but apparently she hadn\u2019t come up yet.Find authorized novels in ReadNovelFull\uff0cfaster updates, better experience\uff0cPlease click www.ReadNovelFull.com for visiting.\u201cThere must be a lot of things to take. Why don\u2019t you take Ian\u2019s attendance first?\u201dKillian\u2019s eyes narrowed as Albert hurried out to call his servant Ian. It was the same baggage every time, and he wondered why it was taking so long today. Killian pretended not to see Ian who came in a hurry, and went downstairs.After walking down the stairs and entering the hall of the inn on the first floor, Killian saw a knight and his own maid flirting. When he watched, a young knight put his face in the maid\u2019s face and began to make a pass at her.Now that he was very tired, he should take a bath and rest, but here she was chatting. Killian, who was impatient with the maid forgetting her job, shouted, \u201cWhat are you doing? Do I have to come down to find my maid who has to serve, as if I did not need to wait?\u201dWhen Julietta, frightened by the roar loud enough to shake the inn, looked to the side when she heard the sound. She could see the Prince, who had gone upstairs, had come down, but was staring at her.She was so surprised that she took the box Gains was holding and headed upstairs. Killian turned to Gains after he stared at the back of the maid who climbed the stairs with her bulky butt swaying.\u201cIf a stranger comes into my bedroom again tonight, I will send you back to the Imperial Castle immediately.\u201dGains, who had been ordered by the Prince to vacate the room intentionally yesterday, opened his mouth to complain of injustice, but the Prince glared at him fiercely and sent himself up.\u2014-Julietta, who felt guilty after being flirted with by a knight, gave up and gave the Prince a nice bath. When she was cleaning the important place, she swung at the sponge, but Killian\u2019s mood was like a sunny day in her way, which had developed without any resistance.Killian, who was looking hard at the sight of the maid rushing back and forth to clean the bathroom and bedroom after setting up the meal, put his fork down. He suddenly remembered that the knight had called her \u2018Julie.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

What\u2019s your original name?\u201d\u201cJulietta Salmon.\u201d\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me your name?\u201dJulietta opened her mouth at the sight of the Prince staring angrily and coldly. Apparently, on the first day, she had said she was Julietta Salmon. \u201cI told you when I said hello on the first day.\u201dFor Killian, who only focused on what he was interested in, Julietta on the first day was a totally unremarkable figure. But he couldn\u2019t tell her that.\u201cShould I even remember the name of a maid? You are arrogant.\u201d Killian covered up his embarrassment with a rebuke, pointed to a cloth package on the sofa to change the subject.\u201cOpen up that.\u201dJulietta secretly glared the Prince, who had asked her name and then called out for her insolence, and looked at the bundle of brown cloth he had pointed out. Curious of the Prince\u2019s intent, she lifted up a huge bundle of cloth from the sofa.Find authorized novels in ReadNovelFull\uff0cfaster updates, better experience\uff0cPlease click www.ReadNovelFull.com for visiting.\u201cWhat is this?\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s your pajamas.\u201d\u201cPajamas?\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m giving it to you in a sense to be more loyal to me in the future. Wear it tonight and sleep.\u201dLooking at the bulky nightgown, which seemed to fit three of her, Julietta managed to swallow the curse of going outside. At this point she thought she must have been pinched by her employer.\u2018Are you punishing me because I hurt Jeff and caused you some inconvenience?\u2019When Julietta glanced at the Prince after a moment of serious thought, his eyes, which had always been harsh or cold and casual, seemed to glow.With the look of anticipation, as Julietta\u2019s twinkling head tilted to the right, the Prince gave her a sly smile. Julietta, who received his characteristic, colorful smile and mellow eyes, opened her mouth more carefully, \u201cThank, thank you.\u201dShe didn\u2019t think that the great Prince wanted her to say thank you, since he gave her a nightgown as a gift, but she was embarrassed by his eyes, so she had to say thank you.\u201cIt must be heartening that you\u2019ve never worn your pajamas since you were born. Okay, good. I\u2019ll give you my permission. It\u2019s a little early, but you can change into pajamas now.\u201d\u2018Good? I can\u2019t believe you like it.\u2019Julietta held her pajamas like a sack, looked sideways at the Prince in a double bind, and was forced to enter her bedroom to change into her new pajamas.Looking around a room that seemed narrower than yesterday, Julietta threw the pajamas she was holding onto the floor to vent her anger on the Prince. That noble Prince must have a taste for bullying her!Julietta, who took out the thick cotton undergarments from her bag again, sighed. She had been happy with her salary, which she had doubled recently, thinking that he would be okay to live in disguise for life, but had not wanted to wipe her head clean.Fortunately, she left the room, taking care not to stiffen her expression, as she sweetened herself with the positive idea that it would be cooler at night and would be tolerable to sleep without covering herself with a blanket.\u2014Five minutes later, Julietta, wearing pajamas on top of cotton undergarments, had to pose one way or another in front of the Prince, like a model on a runway.\u201cYes, it\u2019s good. You look a little more comfortable now. How uncomfortable it must have been to sleep in a maid\u2019s suit.\u201dJulietta had to thank the Prince once again, who was intoxicated with his own generosity.\u201cBut why does it feel like you\u2019ve got a bigger belly than before, all of a sudden?\u201dThe eye of a professional who changed his lover periodically was scary. Even if her waist and hips were fixed to make them look bigger with a wire, they were different from the figure of a body in a tight cotton underwear. Embarrassed by the Prince\u2019s sharp eyes, Julietta hesitated for a moment and spoke faintly, turning her face shamefully. \u201cIt\u2019s because I wear a corset to look slimmer in the daytime.\u201dKillian shook his head as he tried to imagine the maid in front of him in her underwear. Having always seen a naked woman waiting for him on the bed, he could not have known about a woman\u2019s corset in detail.\u201cI see. I don\u2019t know why women do such strange things. Now, change your clothes again and come out. The smell of the food is spreading, so take the bowls out and bring the tea.\u201d\u2018Do you know how I wore this outfit? Are you asking me to change again?\u2019Killian\u2019s sharp voice came from behind as Julietta walked toward the door, unwilling to hear the Prince\u2019s words. \u201cWhere are you going in that outfit?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to call the maid in charge of food. I just need to call her in for a moment, but I was wondering if I should change my clothes in a hassle.\u201dWhen Julietta turned around again, as if she didn\u2019t want to waste her time, Killian shouted in hate. \u201cWhat nonsense are you talking about? Change it now. No matter how happy you are to try on your pajamas for the first time, you can\u2019t walk around in that.\u201dKillian was furious at the thought of the knights hanging by the door.Julietta didn\u2019t understand why he would meddle in her dress, and hesitated for a moment at the door. But she had no courage to refuse the Prince\u2019s order, so he had to quietly go back into the bedroom and change her clothes again.\u2014Killian looked carefully at the maid\u2019s glasses, with her mouth sticking out half a foot in her dress, and put down his tea to drink before going to bed.Julietta\u2019s eyes, which he had looked down when she had been standing bent in the carriage before were completely different from those he had seen through her glasses. Although the interior was dark after lowering the curtain, no one could say they were ugly. They would look prettier without glasses.At the same time, he remembered the young knight who had said her eyes were small but cute, as he had been playing tricks on her downstairs before. Thinking about the scene, he looked at the maid carefully, so ridiculous to see her nose wrinkle as she pulled up her large glasses. He thought he would have to stop ordering her glasses, which he had intended to do after he arrived at Ricaren, seeing that there were some people who were struck by her appearance.Killian nodded satisfactorily, thinking that the reason he didn\u2019t want to order the glasses made by a dwarf was to protect the innocent maid, from his position as her master.\u2014\u2014After a long carriage ride, the group finally entered the Principality of Bertino. At that time, the Prince changed into a plain carriage with no outside emblem, despite the luxurious interior. When Julietta asked Sir Albert about it, he said that if the Prince, the king of the Principality of Bertino, was moving with his identity exposed, it would be uncomfortable for the group and the villages they would stay in and pass by.His arrogant personality seemed to blow trumpets, but she looked at the Prince, who was concentrating on the papers, in surprise.The appearance of the Prince, with his fine soft black hair and long eyelashes half lowered over his silver eyes, was truly perfect for anyone. She thought it would have been icing on the cake if he had a good personality with that look, so she wanted to click her tongue to herself.Killian, who did not know that the rare generous kindness he gave was nothing but grudges for the maid working under him, raised his head and met her eyes. \u201cWhat is it?\u201dDoubtful of why she looked at him like that, he narrowed his eyes, and Julietta replied with her eyes down, \u201cNo, I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re tired after looking at the documents for too long.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I\u2019m glad you think so about your master. Then I\u2019ll take your grateful will. Read these documents aloud until we arrive.\u201dJulietta frowned at once. \u2018Who did I feel sorry for?!\u2019Five minutes ago, he stoned her and she reluctantly accepted the pile of documents handed to her by the Prince.\u201cRead from the first page.\u201dLooking into the heavy papers, Julietta sighed and began to read them\u2026\u2014\u2014\u201c\u2026 so the jewelers in Austern are now saturated, and I don\u2019t think the new jewelry business that you\u2019re about to start with is very good.

After a long time, she gently put down the papers. The Prince\u2019s order was given to her, as she held her breath in the hope that he would remain lost in thought, and her eyes closed slightly.\u201cStop the carriage and call Albert.\u201dIt was a rare serious and calm order. Julietta knocked the driver\u2019s seat to stop the carriage, and then ran back to the carriage following.\u201cYour Highness, did you call me?\u201dAlbert hurried over to the carriage Killian was riding. He thought Julietta might have offended the Prince. He climbed into the carriage with a thumping heart, praying that Mrs. Auguste would quickly find a new maid.\u201cAlbert, let\u2019s stop by a town with a big jeweler before we get to Ricaren. Adam seems very skeptical about the jewelry business. But since my sense is telling me not to give up on the business, I have to find a way.\u201dJulietta glanced down at the documents she had left next to her, looking at the Prince who swept his head and was seriously talking to Albert about his work. She nodded silently, looking at the tightly packed letters on the papers she had read.\u2018Yes, you can get stress if you work so hard. I can understand your bad personality. You are from the top one percent of the royal family, and you\u2019ll be able to spend your whole life playing around, as you\u2019ve been brought up so revered. Yeah, I\u2019m going to have to put up with it. I know your bad personality comes because you are distinguished.\u2019Julietta soothed her mind after peeping at her employer, who was as shiny as a Prince in a fairy tale, what with his appearance and ability.After discussing how to change the route to Ricaren, when Albert returned to his carriage, the Prince closed his eyes and leaned his head against the back of the chair. At the appearance of fatigue, Julietta volunteered to work for him for the first time since she had started working.\u201cYour Highness, would you like a cup of tea?\u201dKillian\u2019s eyes narrowed when the maid, who used to stare secretly and grumble whenever she had been ordered, suddenly showed kindness. \u201cWhat are you up to?\u201dJulietta shrugged, feeling a strange homogeneity with the Prince, who was as much in doubt as she was. \u201cI think it\u2019s time for you to drink.\u201dKillian smiled, feeling strangely comfortable with Julietta\u2019s monotonous way of saying no if he didn\u2019t like it.\u201cYes, it\u2019s time for a drink. It\u2019s also time to get a massage.\u201d\u2018This is why black-headed animals are not to be collected.\u2019She gave a kindness with a warm heart, but the nasty Prince asked for a massage too, and she took out a glass bottle, staring at him without knowing it.\u201cGee!\u201dThe moment she took out the precious glass bottle, the carriage suddenly began to tilt with a bang as if it had hit something. Julietta was more frightened by the glass bottle that left her hand and plunged to the floor of the leaning carriage.Everything was too late by the time she came to her senses, throwing her whole body to protect the glass bottle.The problem was that Killian had to catch Julieta, who was standing dangerously in a leaning carriage. In an instant, the maid fell down on the noble Prince.What was more serious was that the Prince\u2019s hands, which were about to receive her fall, grabbed her back. The wire, which had been fixed to be round, was crushed and her slim waist was caught in his hands.\u201cWhat the hell is going on here?\u201dThe wagon wheel was missing and off to one side. Killian\u2019s hands clutched harder to keep her from moving as Julieta, bewildered, scrambled to get up from the Prince lying under her.\u201c\u2026\u201d No matter how brave Julietta was, there was nothing to say in that situation.\u201cDid I hire not a maid, but a swindler?\u201dAs the fearfully cold Prince spoke, she thought her life might end today. Killian\u2019s heartless hand came to her face, with no change in expression, even though he must have felt her trembling.\u201cWhat the hell is going on here?\u201d\u201cAre these glasses fake, too? Who the hell are you?\u201dAs soon as Killian took off her glasses, the carriage that had fallen sideways with a noise began to rise. Julietta was quickly able to escape the Prince\u2019s hands at the reaction, and stepped back to the corner and began to roll her head.Unlike the noise outside, there was only a heavy silence inside the carriage. Julietta\u2019s mouth froze at the sight of the Prince\u2019s fierce glare.Finally, when the carriage was set straight, Killian grabbed Julietta\u2019s struggling arm and pulled it back in front of him. A chilly order erupted from Killian\u2019s mouth as the captain of the knights, concerned about the Prince\u2019s safety, tried to open the carriage door.\u201cDon\u2019t open the door. I want you to fix up the party and move. I\u2019ll ask you later about today\u2019s accident.\u201dThe muddled surroundings quickly became quiet and the carriage began to move again soon after the Prince\u2019s angry order.Killian stared at Julietta with sharp eyes, sitting on the floor, and he began to grope her whole body with his undaunted touch. When the Prince\u2019s hands moved from cottoned shoulders to her chest through arms, waist and legs, Julietta fumed at his hands, feeling greatly embarrassed.Then she thought, If I am going to die anyway, why should I be so embarrassed by this man?Killian stared silently at Julietta, after withdrawing his hands, as if she had not been trembling in fright, and leaned back after a long time.\u201cWho sent you?\u201dJulietta agonized for a moment at the dismal question of the Prince. She had nothing to say because she was not under someone\u2019s spell, but if he found out that she had spilled wine on him, it could be adding fuel to the fire. However, she lifted her head, pretending to be calm, thinking that the more anxious she was, the more suspicious the Prince would be.\u201cNobody sent me! I came in on my own. I needed a job, and I was just a cleaning maid at the recommendation of Duke Rhodius. If you\u2019re in doubt, ask Marquis Rhodius.\u201dJulietta\u2019s way of talking about the Prince had been impudent for a maid, but neither was conscious at all of when it started.\u201cA cleaning maid? How did a cleaning maid end up working as my maid? And what the hell happened to that dress? You have to be honest and not think about lying.\u201dKillian calmed down when he saw the maid raising her head proudly, as if she had done nothing wrong. In fact, it seemed too awkward to say she was a spy. It was ridiculous that Albert didn\u2019t do a background check on anyone who would work as his own maid. However, he deliberately gave her a more stern look at the thought that he could not figure out why she was wearing such a strange disguise.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The Principality Of Bertino, Part XIVTranslator: KhanEditor: Aelryinth\u201cWhen I was five years old, I was orphaned and I was left in the theater. For an orphan without a guardian, the theater is a dangerous place. So I just got used to dressing up so that I wouldn\u2019t attract people\u2019s attention in order to protect myself. When I was able to leave the theater and work as a maid, I didn\u2019t know where I was working, so I decided to keep my disguise.\u201dThe only disguise in the theater was a wig and make-up, so it was nothing like what she was now, but Julietta, who thought it was not a lie, ignored her conscience. She waited impatiently for the Prince\u2019s answer, hoping that the Prince would please not associate herself with the wine case, after hearing about the theater.At the plausible excuse, Killian once again looked over the maid in front of him. He thought she was not good enough to disguise herself, but he thought that being too cute was true, and that it could not be dismissed as being excessively self-conscious of herself.Even she looked so cute to his eyes, but what about ordinary people? No one would think that his aesthetic sense was brilliant if he thought of the girl in front of him as being cute, but he was extremely generous to himself. He nodded as he recalled the young knight that kept hovering around his maid.\u201cThat\u2019s good. I\u2019ll continue you to allow that disguise.\u201d\u2018Er, this isn\u2019t it.\u2019Though she had to be thankful that her head had not been cut off for deceiving the Prince, Julietta, who now knew the Prince to some extent, must have believed him without realizing it. She didn\u2019t really think he would fire or hurt her, so she now had a slight hope of taking off this uncomfortable, cumbersome dress and wearing a decent maid\u2019s uniform.But she was \u2018allowed\u2019 to disguise herself. She didn\u2019t know why he allowed her to do so, but she didn\u2019t have anything to say to him since she had been working in disguise. Still, Julietta cautiously disagreed, \u201cBut now that you know that, I don\u2019t think I need to continue disguising myself.\u201dSince he was a good owner, she didn\u2019t think what she had worried about in the first place would happen, so she cautiously said, \u201cWhy should I wear this cumbersome disguise?\u201dBut Killian acted like he hadn\u2019t heard that.\u201cNo. You don\u2019t have to stop wearing your familiar disguise. However, it is not necessary to continue disguising at night. I don\u2019t know what you wore inside your pajamas, but take it off and sleep comfortably.\u201dThe bottom line was that only in front of him should she not disguise herself. Killian, ignoring the maid who was moving her lips to say something, grabbed her, lifted her lightly and set her on the chair opposite him.\u201cYour name is Julietta?\u201d\u201cYes, Your Highness.\u201d\u201cMy whole body aches because I was underneath you. Start your massage, Julietta.\u201dPutting his legs on the opposite seat, Killian deliberately, affectionately called her name. At the low voice, Julietta, who got goosebumps despite herself, frowned and grabbed the strong, heavy calf next to her.After the Prince changed his route for the jewelry business, the group arrived at the hotel where they would stay until late at night.Albert, who had been preparing for the Prince\u2019s wrath due to the carriage accident in the morning, was surprised to see the owner getting off the wagon pleasantly. Having no way of knowing what had happened in the carriage as they had never stopped at mid-day and hurried along to arrive early, called Julietta.\u201cIs there no place where his Highness is hurt?\u201dJulietta, who had been rubbing the Prince\u2019s legs and shoulders all day, replied insincerely with tired eyes, \u201cHe\u2019s not hurt. He\u2019s more lively than usual.\u201dIt was time to scold Julietta for her rude remarks. He found the Prince waiting for him over there.Albert looked hard at Julietta, looking forward to seeing her later, and approached his master and asked why he had called. When Albert asked, he looked at him in a way that wondered what he was talking about. \u201cI called you?\u201d\u201cYes. Haven\u2019t you been waiting for me?\u201dIf he had entered the inn, he would have gone straight up to the room where he would spend the night. He thought the Prince had something to say, because he was waiting at the entrance of the stairs. But Killian ignored him and called the maid standing at the entrance. \u201cJulietta!\u201dAs the haggard-looking maid reluctantly approached at the Prince\u2019s call, Killian sent her up first and followed her up. As for Albert, who couldn\u2019t figure out what the situation was, he looked after them in a daze. Killian was thinking of something strange, looking at the swaying dress before his eyes.\u2018I\u2019m going to have to send her up before the young knight gets close again. I can\u2019t let the first maid who\u2019s good at her job in a while be charmed by such play and quit. I\u2019m the only one who will be uncomfortable.\u2019While Albert was looking up at his back with a stunned expression, Killian was merely desperate to protect his maid.After a tiring day, Killian went to bed and looked at Julietta after she took off the bulky cotton clothes and donned pajamas with a surreptitious, surprised expression. He thought once again that he must keep her in disguise, for she looked so different after taking off that ugly dress.Having no idea what Killian was thinking now, Julietta organized the gown the Prince had thrown off and was putting a blanket on the floor beside the bed where he lay.When she took off her cotton clothes, which were a kind of shield, the loose clothes clung to her body. They were baggy pajamas without any decorations, used only for sleeping, but it revealed her lines without a single falsehood and were more seductive than any other woman\u2019s naked body.She lay face down to organize the blanket with her round hips raised to his side, and he watched, being captivated without knowing it, but suddenly he heard Albert\u2019s voice outside.Find authorized novels in ReadNovelFull\uff0cfaster updates, better experience\uff0cPlease click www.ReadNovelFull.com for visiting.\u201cYour Highness, are you sleeping? Count Adam has arrived from Ricaren.\u201dAdam, his aide who had managed the Principality of Bertino and handled the top and even small things of Bertino Business Group during his absence, had received the message sent in via magic this morning and seemed to have finally arrived.In the thought that she was slightly annoyed by Killian, Julietta, who heard Albert\u2019s voice, stood up and started to open the door. Seeing her move, he bounced up like lightning in a desperate, quick move, as if attacked by an enemy.\u201cWhere are you going to? The only place you can get around in this suit is my bedroom. Do you understand?\u201dAt his appearance to turn her shoulders roughly and cry out fiercely, Julietta nodded blankly, and Killian went on again. \u201cI\u2019ll go out, so you can change your clothes and come out. If you show that look to others, I won\u2019t let you go.\u201dKillian, who was holding a pajama-clad woman and threatening her, and Julietta, who looked at him with surprised eyes, nodded; it looked very strange and misleading, and was a freakish appearance. But the two were not aware of their dangerous condition at all.Killian was worried that her maid would look sloppy, so he thought it was just a remark, and Julietta nodded silently because she thought she was so ugly in her baggy nightgown.Killian, who somehow didn\u2019t want to take his hands off her thin shoulders caught over her thin pajamas, patted his hands down along her slim arms. As he turned to don his gown, the door suddenly opened. Albert, who had been waiting for him, tried to come in to wake him up, wondering if the Prince or the maid had fallen asleep.Boom! Killian shut the door a little bit loud, shouted outside in a hurry, \u201cI\u2019ll be out soon, so wait!\u201dWithout knowing that Albert was opening his mouth in a fit of panic as he looked at the hurriedly closed door, Killian hurriedly got dressed and Julieta, who was looking at him behind, turned her head in surprise.Except for the first day and the next day, she had stopped waiting on the Prince\u2019s bath, it had been more than two weeks since she had used the same bedroom.She could have gotten used to his walking around the bedroom in a naked body without any shame, but she still felt embarrassed enough to turn red.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

All he wanted to do was make fun of her when she was so eager and avoided his gaze like that.Killian strode toward his own maid, raised her chin with his fingers and made a bluff as he faced the eyes beyond her glasses. \u201cWhen you\u2019re with me, always look at me. Don\u2019t avoid my gaze.\u201dKillian\u2019s self-confidence, which seemed to have no shame in his body, was hateful, and Julietta answered with a pout, \u201cYes, Your Highness.\u201dAs soon as Killian came out of the living room in his gown, he tightly closed the bedroom door and headed for the sofa where Count Adam was waiting.\u201cAdam, you didn\u2019t have to come in such a hurry.\u201d\u201cYou said you\u2019d visit the mine and jewelry stores. I think I\u2019m with\u2026 Your Highness?\u201dKillian, who gracefully greeted the Count, suddenly turned and pushed Albert, who was about to enter the bedroom before his greeting was over. Albert, who had been pushed so hard, barely recovered from the stagger, looked at Killian in surprise.\u201cYour Highness, what the hell is wrong with you?\u201d\u201cWhy are you going into the room?\u201d\u201cI have to ask the maid to take out the tea. It doesn\u2019t make sense to be sleeping without waiting on Your Highness. I\u2019ll have to scold her.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s not sleeping. She got up and was changing her clothes. And tell your servant to take the tea.\u201dLike a gatekeeper protecting a treasure trove, he stood there staring at him with fierce eyes, and Albert\u2019s eyes were raised as if it were suspicious. \u201cYour Highness, why didn\u2019t you let me in earlier?\u201dKillian, who paused at Albert\u2019s questioning, lost his temper abruptly. \u201cNo, then, you\u2019re naked, and you\u2019d feel good if someone told you you were coming in?\u201d\u201cYour Highness, I\u2019ve been with you ever since you were wearing diapers. If I entered your room, when was your appearance important? When I couldn\u2019t go in and out of your bedroom, it was because there was a woman in the room, not because of your clothes.\u201dAlbert thought it couldn\u2019t be, but he glared at the bedroom door behind him in the act of his so suspicious master.\u201cIs this your woman in the room now?\u201dAdam\u2019s eyes began to glisten with interest at the confrontation between the Prince and Albert. He wondered who the woman in the room was, so that the Prince wouldn\u2019t let him see so desperately. Albert said that the woman inside was a maid. But the Prince was not a man to think otherwise about a maid, so he wanted to know more about her.\u201cWhat are you talking about, Albert? What the hell are you looking at me for? When have you ever seen me do anything lewd to the maids?\u201dKillian was excited by Albert\u2019s ridiculous misunderstanding. Albert looked at the bedroom door once again, looking at the Prince, who was so angry that he put his hand on his waist in a naked gown as if he were falsely charged.\u201cIt was the opposite, because the maids who have served you have always done that. But these days, your actions are very strange. It\u2019s even more suspicious that you have been hateful of a maid, but you\u2019re acting so strangely this way.\u201dClick! Albert, who contested for every inch of ground, shut his mouth when the bedroom door opened. The arrogant woman who forgot her duty and came out late due to her laziness was disgusting. He also thought that he would inquire her to account how she made the noble Prince do what he had never done before, without knowing who she was.Find authorized novels in ReadNovelFull\uff0cfaster updates, better experience\uff0cPlease click www.ReadNovelFull.com for visiting.Albert, who was just waiting for an unseen maid to appear, was overshadowed by Killian, who blocked the bedroom door with his height, and was speechless when he saw Julietta\u2019s ugly appearance. Then he shook his head from side to side, as if he had come to his senses.\u201cOh, Your Highness. I\u2019m sorry. I guess I\u2019ve grown senile. I\u2019d like to have you with me for a long time, but I feel so sad when I get distracted sometimes.\u201dShe got messy hair, badly crumpled clothes, glasses, and sticky oil on her face. No matter how much his master had no taste, that was not his.His master had been without a woman for more than a month, so he thought it might be, but as soon as he saw the maid\u2019s appearance, he suddenly came to his senses.\u2018What is this misguided thought that has done such discourtesy to the noble master?\u2019Albert stopped looking suspicious and apologized once again, regretting his indecent act. Killian frowned at Albert\u2019s sudden change of mood.\u201cWhat? Why are you apologizing all of a sudden?\u201d Killian felt even worse at Albert\u2019s visibly relaxed look as he looked at behind him. The moment he tried to argue with Albert without knowing why he was so displeased, Julietta\u2019s forward look threw his mouth wide open.She hurried to come out in her own conceit, and the chest part of the maid, who stroked her hair more comfy than usual, was open. When her white collarbone and breastbone were in sight between the clothes that had been opened because her front buttons were less locked, Killian shouted in outrage.\u201cWhere are you coming out of looking like that? Enter the room in a hurry!\u201dAlbert nodded, as the Prince held the maid to her shoulder and put her in the room. He was crazy. It must have been really senile to doubt the Prince and that ugly girl.\u2018If His Highness sees how hideous the girl is, how quickly will he let her in?\u2019While Albert was sweeping down his chest, Adam was rather tilting his head. In the eyes of the Count, who had raised the Prince since he was a child, it seemed to be unusual in itself that he showed interest in the clothes of a maid.Killian, who had no idea what Adam was thinking, was back in front of him only after confirming the closing of the door of the room that the maid had entered with a disapproving face.\u201cThe Count, it\u2019s late at night, so let\u2019s skip the tea. Now that I know you\u2019ve arrived and we\u2019ve met, you can leave now. Let\u2019s talk about the rest after getting up tomorrow.\u201dAdam laughed at what was obviously a message to drive him away. He asked, as he could see the Prince\u2019s gaze was constantly heading toward the bedroom.\u201cI think it\u2019s my loyalty to you that will quickly disappear, but didn\u2019t you wonder why I came running as soon as I got your message?\u201dKillian hesitated for a moment, as the Count ventured a curious question, smiling. Unknowingly looking toward the bedroom again, he reluctantly leaned back on the sofa and nodded to let him speak. When Killian\u2019s permission was given, Adam leaned down with his elbows on both knees.\u201cMarquis Anais and his daughter arrived yesterday in Ricaren. Your Highness invited Lady Anais to visit the Principality of Bertino at a banquet last winter.\u201d\u201cDid I?\u201d Killian asked back. as if he had never heard of it.\u201cYes. I heard that Your Highness had told Lady Anais that you would be at the Principality of Bertino for a few months on business after April, and you invited her to visit with her family.\u201dAs Killian frowned to remember Lady Anais, Adam gently added, \u201cShe has chestnut hair and light blue eyes.\u201dDespite Adam\u2019s kindness, Killian, who remembered only what he wanted to remember, had to search his memory for a long time.\u201cLady Anais would be the granddaughter of the Duchess of Dudley\u2026 I have no idea. I don\u2019t remember. Truly.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think you could have done that. But what could I say when they unpacked at Calen Castle as an excuse? It was none other than your invitation.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re sitting in my castle now?\u201d\u201cYes. They arrived this morning. That\u2019s why I ran away to you, I had no idea how to act at all. What was the idea of Marquis Anais visiting Bertino with his daughter? Lady Anais doesn\u2019t care about politics, but the Marquis visited, so that is possible. I have no idea what he\u2019s thinking.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The Principality Of Bertino, Part XVITranslator: KhanEditor: AelryinthAt Adam\u2019s words, Killian was still thinking, calculating something. After much contemplation, he opened his mouth to the Count. \u201cLook into whether the relationship between Marquis Anais and Duke Kielini, who are in-laws, is still estranged. Duke Martin and Duke Kiellini are on their way to Calen Castle to attend this summer\u2019s hunt. I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s up to, but he\u2019s not the one who\u2019s going to think about coming all the way to Bertino because of his daughter\u2019s nagging.\u201dAdam nodded at Killian\u2019s instructions, and sighed. \u201cWhen I received the title of the Count of Bertino, I just wanted to be away from my father\u2019s nagging, but I couldn\u2019t help but come here.\u201dKillian\u2019s right-hand man, who received his title of Count from the Principality of Bertino, stayed in Calen Castle for most of the year. It was to manage the principality for Prince Killian, the current King of Bertino.Unlike his older brother, Ronald Julio Martin Adam grew as a companion with Prince Killian in the Imperial Castle from childhood. Such was intended by Duke Martin, who was a disciple of the former king of Bertino, Killian\u2019s maternal grandfather.Unlike another subordinate, Oswald, who later volunteered to choose Killian, Adam, who had no choice but to take Killian as his master since he was a child, did not have a good relationship with his father, Duke Martin. But now that Adam himself truly served Killian, his relationship with his father had improved, and now he and his father were working together to make Killian the next emperor.Adam was frustrated to hear that his butt-heavy father, Duke Martin, was coming to Bertino, because he was still awkward around the man, although their relationship had improved a lot. Whether his aide had a deep sigh or not, Killian sprang up as if his business was over.\u201cI\u2019ve heard all the urgent reports, so go back to your room now. I\u2019ll have to rest if I want to move again tomorrow.\u201dAdam rose as Killian looked at the door of his bedroom, looking like a bear hiding a honey jar.\u201cYes, Your Highness. I\u2019m very tired, as I have really overdone it riding a horse today. See you tomorrow.\u201dKillian, who almost forced Adam and Albert out, hurried back to the room, but his brazen maid was changed into her pajamas and sleeping with a regular breath. There was nothing special to do about her not falling asleep, but Killian, feeling something missing, stood beside his sleeping maid for a long time and then reluctantly went to bed.\u2014\u2014\u201cWhy are you in this carriage?\u201d As soon as he saw Count Adam on board first, Killian frowned disapprovingly.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing more substantial on the road than business in the carriage. I was wondering if you\u2019d like to hear a detailed report on the situation in the principality,\u201d Adam grinned and said to the Prince, who had a slight frown on his face.Julietta, who came down from the cleaning a moment later, hesitated when she saw the strange man she had seen for a while last night while trying to get on the wagon in a hurry.Find authorized novels in ReadNovelFull\uff0cfaster updates, better experience\uff0cPlease click www.ReadNovelFull.com for visiting.Seeing the man sitting opposite the Prince where she had been sitting, she hesitated about where to sit, and she decided to sit next to her employer and wait. But the strange man shouted at Julietta, who gently lowered her hips to sit next to the Prince, \u201cHow dare you try to sit next to His Highness? Get out to the driver\u2019s seat!\u201dWhen the startled Julietta got up in a hurry, Killian said bluntly, \u201cHow can she listen to me outside? Just let it go.\u201dJulietta glanced at the other side at the Prince\u2019s command. The man, who was looking at the Prince with a thoughtful face, pointed at the seat next to him as he met her eyes. Killian\u2019s big hand pulled her arm as Julietta raised herself at the silent command.\u201cYour Highness, how can a maid sit with you? Please send her over here.\u201dKillian said to Adam as if it was annoying, speaking gravely, \u201d Count, don\u2019t expect to be served by my maid in the carriage, bring your own servant in.\u201d\u201cUnfortunately, I sent my servant for an errand early this morning. He\u2019s going to join me in Beopash later this evening.\u201dKillian nodded reluctantly.Between Killian, who seemed to be in a bad mood, and Count Adam, who kept talking regardless, the group went on their journey without much difficulty.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Beopash was the second most bustling town after Ricaren, the capital of the Principality of Bertino. It took only four or five hours from the village where they stayed last night, and because they were supposed to arrive in Beopash and have lunch, the carriage ran on the well-cleaned forest road without a break. Count Adam, who had been reporting various issues for a long time, suddenly coughed.\u201cI have been talking a lot, and I\u2019m getting thirsty. Your Highness, why don\u2019t we take a break for a cup of tea?\u201dJulietta, who thought it was time for the Prince to take his tea, put her hand on the dress button to bring out the glass bottle. Killian looked back at Julietta at her action, and rushed out his words to stop her from acting.\u201cCount, we\u2019ll be arriving in Beopash in a little while. Bear it. My maid caused a big burn while preparing my tea in a moving carriage. Because of that, I\u2019ve decided to refrain from drinking tea in the carriage in the future.\u201dJulietta almost snorted with dismay at her brazen employer\u2019s words. \u2018I don\u2019t know who\u2019s been drinking tea for several cups in the wagon, then?\u2019It was just absurd for him to realize that it was dangerous to drink hot tea in a moving carriage.While Julietta chattered inwardly, Adam gave a sad sigh.\u201cJeepers, I\u2019m sorry to hear that. It was strange when I couldn\u2019t see Jeff and saw a maid who I have not seen around you. Then I can\u2019t drink tea, but I\u2019ll have to drink some water.\u201dWhen Count Adam looked as if to ask for water, Julietta took out only a bottle of water without a teacup from the box containing the tea and held it out to the Count. Adam\u2019s expression was distorted when he saw a rough-looking bottle of water that she handed out so rudely. Although she was working as the maid of the Prince, she was not used to serving the nobility yet, so she committed the act unconsciously.\u201cWhat an arrogant girl you are! Do you want me to put my mouth on a bottle of water and drink it? Your Highness, where the hell did you get this unlearned maid?\u201dAs Adam\u2019s voice thundered through the carriage, Killian\u2019s barely-drawn eyebrows stretched back.\u201cThe Count, there\u2019s a situation we can\u2019t control when we travel. Drinking with your mouth on a water bottle for a day doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re going to die, so just let it go.\u201d\u2018Since when has this noble-born arrogant Prince ever been so generous? Since childhood, the three of us have grown up together: Marquis Rhodius, the Prince, and myself. Few would know when the Prince lost his virginity, what he likes and dislikes, and what he thinks.\u201cKillian has used only the finest porcelain cups and silverware sets during his trips, and the water to drink has to be separately prepared at the Imperial Castle and included in the procession of two wagons which carry only water.\u201cIt is a precious rule that the chef follows wherever he goes and cooks and serves with the best quality ingredients he gets there. Why else would all those wagons behind the Prince\u2019s wagon?\u2019When he heard such sounds of \u2018unavoidable circumstances\u2019 from Killian\u2019s mouth, Adam wanted to laugh his head off. He hurriedly accepted a bottle of water from Julietta to cover his twitching mouth.Adam, who was adept at hiding his laughter, observed the maid in front of him. She was much calmer than she had been yesterday. But she still had stiff hair and hideous glasses that covered half her face, and a big, thick body that was not smaller than Killian\u2019s broad shoulders.\u2018What characteristics of this maid drew the Prince\u2019s generosity and attention?\u2019Adam was busy looking at the maid who was sitting properly, here and there, not noticing Killian staring at him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The Principality Of Bertino, Part XVIITranslator: KhanEditor: AelryinthKillian, who could no longer stand Adam keeping his eyes on Julietta even after drinking water, shot back sharply, \u201cCount, I\u2019d like you to finish your report if you have revived your throat.\u201dAt Killian\u2019s shrill voice, Adam, looking at Julietta, quickly asked back, \u201cYes? Ah, Your Highness. Yes. I\u2019ll finish the report. How far have I gotten?\u201d\u201cAfter you reported the list of nobles who would attend this summer\u2019s hunting competition, you stopped.\u201dAdam smiled and said to the voice that he did not hide that he was so mad he could spit nails,\u201cYes, I\u2019ve told you that much. Then I have to say this, too: Prince Francis is also expected to attend.\u201d\u201cWhat? Is he coming to Bertino? No way! It can\u2019t be!\u201d\u201cBut he is. He has to come because of Lady Anais, even if he doesn\u2019t want to come.\u201d\u201cThe target must have been changed to his cousin, Lady Anais. Is it because of the rumors with Lady Haint and Count Derio? I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to stick to such rumors. Have there been any other variables?\u201dAdam nodded when the Prince asked about the report he had received before leaving for Bertino. \u201cYes, that\u2019s the second reason I had to hurry up to you yesterday. According to a message from Marquis Rhodius, Lady Haint is pregnant. They say that it\u2019s information only a few know.\u201d\u201cSpenser must have had a hard time figuring it out.\u201d\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t have been that hard. Your dear Moira is now the concubine of Duke Haint.\u201d\u201cWho?\u201dAt Killian\u2019s lukewarm question, Adam shook his head in embarrassment. \u201cYour Highness, you should remember the names of the women you\u2019ve had. I don\u2019t know when, but I know she\u2019s one of the women who\u2019s been warming your bed.\u201dKillian slightly frowned.\u201cI can\u2019t remember.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you want to remember, or don\u2019t you really remember?\u201d\u201cThink of it as you wish.\u201dJulietta casually opened her mouth at the sight of Killian turning his head out of the window, as if Adam\u2019s questioning was annoying.\u201cIt was exactly two months ago.\u201d\u2018Oh, no, this poor mouth.\u2019The exact date popped out of Julietta\u2019s mouth. As she looked quickly at the Prince\u2019s gaze, the Count was delighted to ask back, \u201cOh, how do you know?\u201dJulietta quickly lowered her head, blaming herself for not being careful with Adam\u2019s question. Adam spoke soothingly to her, as she avoided his eyes.\u201cI won\u2019t scold you, so tell me. It is your duty as a maid to tell him what His Highness does not remember. Isn\u2019t that right, Your Highness?\u201dJulietta looked at the silent Killian, then looked carefully at Adam again. He smiled at her, nodding his head as if to say right away.\u201cWhen I was working at the Bertino mansion on Harrods Street, I was attending to her tea.\u201d\u201cOh, so you used to work in that mansion, right?\u201dAdam quickly helped her along. Julietta once again looked at her employer and answered the Count.\u201cYes. Miss Moira was kicked out after she got angry with His Highness for something unsavory, but since I worked as a maid before, I\u2019ve attended to her tea.\u201dThe last time had been bad, but she had been doing pretty well before then. It would be a surprise to Anna and Nicole to hear that, as they had been fired, but Julietta recalled that compared to the widow, Viscountess Morbido, the next woman of the Prince, Moira was really nice.\u201cOh, you were the private maid who was on duty in His Highness\u2019s bedroom. So, wasn\u2019t it hard for you to work?\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t hard at all except to get the ladies out of His Highness\u2019s bedroom. His Highness was so matchless that my legs were a little numb when it took too long.\u201dFind authorized novels in ReadNovelFull\uff0cfaster updates, better experience\uff0cPlease click www.ReadNovelFull.com for visiting.When Killian\u2019s eyes grew bigger at Julietta\u2019s words, Adam burst into the laughter he had kept silent until then.If other people had said this in front of him, he would not have left her alone, but Killian, curious as to what Julietta would say about him, struggled to keep calm and waited for the following words. If Albert saw him now, he might have cried out.\u201cWas he that matchless?\u201d\u201cPhew, don\u2019t even talk. I\u2019ve never known that a man could do it that long at a time and it\u2019s really possible. One time sex wasn\u2019t the end of the show. Some days, he didn\u2019t rest until dawn, doing three or four times. I was surprised because it was so different from what I knew.\u201dJulietta began to move her mouth, which she had long wanted to talk to anyone about, as the Prince did not make any particular motion to stop her. Killian listened to Julietta\u2019s admiration in a calm, embarrassed but not bad mood, but was stunned at the last words.\u201cIt\u2019s different from what you know? How do you know that?\u201dAdam interjected with Killian\u2019s question as if it were natural.\u201cGee, Your Highness. Why are you asking her about that? She knows because she has experience.\u201dAt Adam\u2019s words, Julietta tried to say no, but shut her mouth. \u2018I\u2019ve seen so many things in my past that I know them well. But I don\u2019t have any real experience,\u2019 \u2026she could not say that.\u2018Indirect experience is also experience.\u2019When Julietta smiled at the thought that it was not a lie, Adam smiled as if he was right, but Killian\u2019s feelings were bad without knowing why.Adam was troubled when he saw Killian, who had joy and sorrow in quick alteration, not angry at the abandoned remarks of the maid. It wasn\u2019t the Prince he had known. What he had seen last night was not wrong, and he looked at the ugly maid again with a serious face.\u2018Is His Highness serious? Am I right about what I thought?\u2019Killian\u2019s image of yesterday and today was not one he had ever seen since childhood. He also wanted to make fun of him, who was totally different from the image of someone who had been in a proper relationship with the right woman at the right time.But the more he saw Killian\u2019s reactions, the more serious Adam became. He didn\u2019t seem to realize it, but his actions were just like those of a male in the breeding season.Adam was beginning to worry about Killian, who seemed to be stuck in the wrong place, at the wrong time, in the wrong way. Thinking that His Highness\u2019s new lover might be an ugly maid, he was also concerned that he would have to find a way to avoid ridicule from his political opponents, too.Due to the seemingly unhappy Prince and the serious Count, the mood of the carriage inside became quiet, and Julietta began to read their countenances.After she slept and woke up in the same room while suddenly traveling with the Prince, the fear and alertness of his status as a Prince had disappeared.\u2018How can you wag your tongue? You know where this is!\u2019Living a slim and long life was the goal of life, but at this time, it seemed as if her old personality of Jenna remained the same to her. Julietta once again reflected deeply about her ability to drive a nail into her own coffin\u2026\u2014\u2014Meanwhile, the carriage arrived at its destination.As she got out of the carriage, she saw the most luxurious accommodations she had ever stayed in. It was the second-largest city, next to the capital city, and the hotel was definitely different in size.Julietta looked at the back of the Prince, who entered his quarters without a word. He seemed to be very angry at her rude remarks. Having decided to apologize for her earlier presumptuous attitude, she hurried to take off the Prince\u2019s traveling outfit.The huge three-story lodge had a lounge on the first floor like a modern hotel, with many people moving busily to and fro.These days when they arrived at an inn, the Prince used to wait for her to pick up the luggage in front of the stairs leading up to the room and take her up. However, Julietta could not find him anywhere and was slightly embarrassed.She looked through the wide first floor with her heart as if she was a child who lost her mother, but she couldn\u2019t see the handsome black-haired figure holding his head. After a moment of dithering, Julietta looked up at the elegantly stretched stairs on one side of the lounge and moved on with a dead look.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The Principality Of Bertino, Part XVIIITranslator: KhanEditor: AelryinthHolding a box of tea and a bag of shabby clothes, she climbed up the red-carpeted ivory stairs and saw a row of escort knights lined up on the second-floor corridor. They showed that this was the place where the Prince was, without anyone guiding her.He was a Prince who always took a bath and ate when he arrived at his lodgings. The panic made Julietta urgent, as she had been delayed a lot on the ground floor.She hurried into the room for fear of being scolded again, and saw the Prince and the Count, who were already dining under Albert\u2019s care. Sometimes, he was attended by Albert if she was busy with other things, but the happening in the carriage weighed on her mind, and she thought her employer was very angry because she had not known her station and talked rubbish.\u2018Let\u2019s give my pride to a dog.\u2019Julietta muttered about her lifestyle, which she had always reflected on, living as an illegitimate child without any background in a society with a class system, and once again vowed to beg for forgiveness.She hung around for a moment if there was anything he would ask her to do, but she was devastated by the sight of the Prince, who didn\u2019t even turn his eyes. After entering what appeared to be a bedroom and organizing the Prince\u2019s luggage, Julietta returned to the living room and waited with her head down firmly while the Prince and the Count were eating.When the servants in charge of the meal cleared the utensils, the Prince and the Count moved on to the terrace. Killian gave an order without even looking at her as Julietta, who was reading his face, prepared tea.\u201cI\u2019ll set off to the jeweler\u2019s after drinking tea, so have a meal in the meantime and come.\u201dKillian was strangely in a bad mood from a while ago. He thought that it was because of the maid who had wagged her tongue about his private life to the Count.Ignoring that the Count was a close friend who knew everything about him, he didn\u2019t even consider that the time when he had felt bad was after he had been hinted she had a lover, when she had not. He purposely strictly managed and ignored her face to punish her, but the sight of her standing dead from then on was annoying.He had to leave for the jeweler\u2019s shop in a little while, but he was so anxious when he saw her standing there without taking a meal. Killian was angry at Albert and couldn\u2019t bear it, and ordered his maid\u2019s meal himself. Adam\u2019s expression was distorted. At the image of his lord, who seemed to have fallen in love with an ugly maid, Adam had a headache and massaged his temples.Killian didn\u2019t care about Adam at all, and was worried about how to deal with the Prince\u2019s upcoming scandal about his new lover. Whether his aide looked at him with a serious look or not, he was busy nodding at the maid, as she was to eat before leaving.Albert, who was looking at him, finally couldn\u2019t bear it and said, \u201cYour Highness, I\u2019ll take you out this time. Tell the maid to eat slowly and rest.\u201dUnlike the villages where they had stayed so far, it was Beopash, the second-largest city in the Principality of Bertino. Albert felt some uneasiness, at both the strange phenomenon that the appearance of the maid caused seemed to be worse today, and at the sight of the Prince trying to take care of the ugly maid.\u201cAlbert, it seems to me that you\u2019re the one who needs to rest. Don\u2019t say anything about your back pain and rest until we leave tomorrow. Julietta, you go ahead to eat, and come after.\u201dWhen Killian, who blocked Albert trying to say something, urged her on, Julietta slowly headed toward the door. She was relieved to see the Prince let her eat.Killian, who was looking at the back of the maid as she flew out of the room, leaned against the back of a chair and touched the cold teacup to his mouth.Looking at the image as if it were disgusting, Adam looked back at Albert, who was tilting his head. Adam offered words of consolation to the old grand chamberlain inwardly, who was looking alternately at the door where the maid had left and Killian, for whatever reason.\u2018Sir Albert, I think it\u2019s better for you to not know anything yet.\u2019Being cautious because of her words after she had wagged her tongue too much in the carriage, Julietta hurried so as to not hurt her employer\u2019s feelings. When she returned to the room after a meal eaten so hastily that she did not know whether it went into her mouth or nose, the Prince stood up as if he had waited for her.As the Count also rose and left the room, Julietta, who was following them calmly, again clamped down on herself, as everything was going easy and she was apparently relieved of blame. Adam laughed when he saw Julietta clenching her fist, determined in her heart that she would never do anything to get herself killed.He was worried about his lord, who paid all attention to someone who didn\u2019t fit in, but he thought it would be okay to have a little bit of entertainment. This emotional play would be a luxury once the political battle for the Crown Prince\u2019s seat began in earnest.Adam, who had been swamped in thought while looking at the Prince\u2019s maid, hurriedly turned his head when suddenly he felt a prickly look. But a shrill voice attacked him, letting him know he was already late.\u201cThe Count, do you think you can move after the sun has gone down? I don\u2019t know if I can get to the jeweler\u2019s by the end of the day.\u201dWith Killian expressing his anger with his twisted tone, Adam quickly moved on to his side. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Your Highness. I\u2019ve been thinking about something else for a while. Let\u2019s go.\u201dLooking coolly at Adam, who was smiling and pulling his arm with a bold face, Killian climbed into the waiting carriage. Julietta and Adam followed, and the unmarked black wagon, surrounded by escort knights, began to drive briskly.\u2014\u2014They arrived on a well-built road, a flashy, busy street.The streets lined with shops showed off their grandeur and style, each dressed in a colorful array. Pictures of what was being sold hung in each store. The street was as beautiful as a painting.In the middle of the colorful garden of sunny buildings, the wagon and its party stopped. Killian got off after the guards searched the perimeter, confirmed there was no problem, and opened the carriage door.Find authorized novels in ReadNovelFull\uff0cfaster updates, better experience\uff0cPlease click www.ReadNovelFull.com for visiting.In the midst of the unusual atmosphere of guards, the two men\u2019s brilliant appearance drew admiration from the mouths of the ladies who were walking back and forth down the streets.The ladies, busy speculating about their status thanks to the unmarked carriage, burst out laughing when they saw the generous-sized maid get out of the carriage after a while. They paid keen attention because he seemed to be of no ordinary status, but they were relieved to think that he was a humble nobleman when they looked at the unmarked carriage and the maid.The ladies and passers-by were pointing fingers and laughing, but Julietta was not bothered by their reaction.As she walked into the tranquil gray building under everyone\u2019s eyes, she looked around, wondering about the room without saying anything. He said he was visiting a jeweler\u2019s shop, but there were only tables, sofas and chairs everywhere, without a single display case. It felt as if she had visited the reception room of a nobleman.What she had bought for herself after living in the Austern Empire for decades was only a feather pen, and she looked outside, wondering, What the hell is this place? This inside is completely different from the grocery store that used to sell all kinds of items. Even the arched lattice windows facing the street had only purple curtains, and there was nothing to tell what this place was selling.By the time she was at the height of her curiosity that it wasn\u2019t a teahouse, the door inside the waiting room opened and a man in a red vest and a white shirt with colorful embroidery came out to greet them.\u201cI welcome you. What kind of merchandise are you looking for?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The Principality Of Bertino, Part XIXTranslator: KhanEditor: AelryinthThe shopkeeper had his curly hair turned back so that it wouldn\u2019t run down at all, and wore a stiff cravat, a wide, rectangular cloth wrapped around his neck like a scarf. Due to his luxurious clothes and condescending manner, it seemed to be no ordinary shop.Adam approached the shopkeeper while Julietta was so thinking.As the count began to talk to the owner about one thing or another, Killian sat down in a reception chair in the center of the store. Julietta, who settled herself behind him gently, seriously agonized over the back of his handsome head.She had spoken in sincere admiration of the prince\u2019s nightlife, but he must have been very angry with the maid who casually bragged about his private life. She was just looking for a chance to apologize, to say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ll never do that again.\u201d But she couldn\u2019t help but feel uncomfortable.Adam, who had just returned from talking to the shopkeeper, spoke to Julietta, who was restless behind Killian. \u201cIs there anything you want to say? Then don\u2019t hesitate to say it.\u201dKillian\u2019s head turned slightly to her at the count\u2019s question. With his silent permission, Julietta hurried to go around to his front and ask for forgiveness.\u201cYour Highness, forgive me for what I said earlier in the carriage. I did not know who I was and made a mistake, leaning on your generosity. I promise it won\u2019t happen again.\u201dKillian\u2019s face stiffened for a moment and then relaxed as Julietta bent down and eagerly sought forgiveness.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing you can\u2019t say before me and the Count of Adam, so there\u2019s no need to ask for forgiveness. But in front of others, you should be careful about this, because I shouldn\u2019t let things go about my personal life.\u201dKillian felt a strange sense of deja vu at the sight of Julietta bending down to ninety degrees, begging for forgiveness.Adam continued, looking at Killian, who recalled that he must have seen it somewhere.\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re not one who\u2019ll just be angry or say anything about it, but in front of another nobleman we shouldn\u2019t have to say that you need to be careful of your words and actions.\u201dJulietta nodded firmly at the Count\u2019s words. He asked for forgiveness himself, thinking he must have been crazy for a while. Then, the shopkeeper who had gone inside came out with an expensive-looking box wrapped in velvet fabric.Julietta, wondering what was in it, unknowingly looked up. The owner made a face and glared at Julietta.She used to work in the theater\u2019s prop room and matched the jewelry and decorations to the costumes of the actors. Of course, the jewels used for theater props looked plausible from a distance, but they were like toys that were too crude to look upon up close. But it was Julietta\u2019s job to combine even those fake jewels with a dress.So her interest grew as the actresses used the jewels and dresses they had received from their followers. She often sketched out the designs of her envisioned dresses and jewels.She was curious about what designs of Bertino\u2019s jewels would be. But as she had the owner\u2019s fierce eyes, she slowly retreated to the corner, and Killian said with a slight sigh, \u201cCome and sit down. Maybe your eyes, though you are a maid, can be more accurate than ours.\u201dAt the words, Adam pushed the shopkeeper, whose eyes were wide, \u201cShow me what\u2019s in it.\u201d\u201cYes, sir.\u201dThe owner opened the lid of the jewelry boxes he was holding, and laid them on the table. The jewels in each box seemed to brighten up the dimly decorated shop, and Julietta was impressed.She forgot how she had dared to sit by His Highness\u2019s side, and was moved by a group of glowing stones like a bachelor possessed by a woman. Sitting by Killian\u2019s side naturally, she gazed at the jewels with a face that was literally salivating.Looking at the resplendent glare of red, blue, yellow and green color, Julietta came to her senses and finally tilted her head.After all, it was a jewelry store. But she didn\u2019t understand why there was no device to show what this place was like. As the interior was empty, she wondered if this was a disguised business or if there was a smuggling business behind the scenes.It was so strange that it had no advertisements to tempt consumers, and a fancy display case that boasted to its customers and asked them to buy it. Though it was a dimension that had magic and ecclesiastical calendar, it was oddly similar to the Middle Ages of the Earth.Julietta, who found her reason for understanding, looked down at the jewels once again, and felt a stinging gaze. As she lifted her head toward the eye, she saw the shopkeeper staring deathly at her for fear that her saliva might even fall on the gems; she was surprised and suddenly stood up and hid herself behind her employer\u2019s wide back like a shield.Lance, who had been crafting jewelry as part of the family business for generations, was a craftsman with great skills in the Principality of Bertino. Feeling so proud of his job of carving and trimming simple stones and turning them into dazzling ornaments, he thought something ugly in this world would bother him more than anything else.In his eyes, Julietta had such a hideous look that he didn\u2019t want to be in the same room for a moment. He was worried that the hideousness of a maid that was hard to look upon would be transferred to his beautiful work.Find authorized novels in ReadNovelFull\uff0cfaster updates, better experience\uff0cPlease click www.ReadNovelFull.com for visiting.Lance, barely able to frown himself, snapped shut the lid of the jewelry box close to the maid and moved it to the other side. The ugly face looked up at him, and quickly got up and went around to the back of her master.He was nodding with satisfaction, thinking that at least she understood who she was, but the Prince\u2019s expression at seeing the shopkeeper\u2019s behavior became cold.Adam quickly spoke up, feeling anxious that Killian would upset the store while siding with the maid if left unchecked. \u201cDo you have a set of amethyst?\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t have many people looking for them, so we don\u2019t have anything ready at the moment. It\u2019s less popular than diamonds, sapphires, rubies and other jewels. In particular, since the Principality of Bertino is the largest producer of amethyst, there is more supply than demand, and the value of the jewelry is low and not popular.\u201dAfter Killian looked at the brilliantly lit jewels for a while, he stared hard at the owner and got up from his seat. When Killian nodded and went out, Adam, who was given his silent instructions, ordered the shopkeeper. \u201cI\u2019ll buy everything here, so put it in the carriage.\u201d\u2014\u2014-After returning to the inn, Killian looked at the jewelry sets he had purchased, and said to Adam,\u201cIt\u2019s definitely not up to dwarven work, but this is very good handwork. I\u2019ll also add this man to the list of craftworkers of Bertino Business Group.\u201cClearly, even though it is comparable to the workings of the famous jewelers in Austern, the jewelry shops are now saturated. Why don\u2019t we find a market for amethyst, rather than going into the uncertain jewelry business?\u201dAt Adam\u2019s words, Killian was lost in thought. The Principality of Bertino was the continent\u2019s largest producer of diamonds and amethysts. However, Killian was struggling to extract the maximum profit from what he had, as it was natural that profit had been reduced by selling the same resources over several generations.Certainly, as Adam said, the well-known jewelers who had inherited the family businesses from generation to generation were abounding in Austern and Vicern, so he was hesitant to jump in. No matter how big the capital was, there was no guarantee that he could make a profit from the competition unless he set up a different sales strategy.The only thing Killian held a dominant position over the other jewelers was that he had dwarven workers, but there were only five of them. He couldn\u2019t sell all of his products with dwarves\u2019 handwork. As such, it was too much to launch a jewelry business under the pretext of differentiation.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The Principality Of Bertino, Part XXTranslator: KhanEditor: AelryinthSeeing Killian agonizing, Adam turned his attention to the maid standing next to him, as if trying to change the mood.\u201cHow did it look to you? Compared to the Austern jewelry stores, it\u2019s not much different here, is it?\u201dJulietta had been listening to the two men, in a relaxed mood after she had apologized for what had happened in the carriage earlier. While imagining that she could do this while listening to them, she was surprised by the sudden question of the Count.She wanted to answer his urgent eyes, but she couldn\u2019t have known what Austern\u2019s jewelry store looked like. Furthermore, as she had firmly vowed not to wag her tongue beyond her station, she had to keep her mouth shut even if she had something to say.Julietta lowered her head to the Count and tried to say that she knew nothing. But a stuffy feeling that she didn\u2019t know blocked her mouth.Even though she had never visited a jewelry store in Austern, she had seen the luxurious shops of world-class jewelry brands indirectly in various media and magazines in the past life. She wanted to talk about the questions she had had earlier, so she was burning to speak; her hopeful ambition to live a slim, long life as a passive, gentle lady was constantly falling apart.Adam smiled, seeing that Julietta wanted to say something and moved her lips, but closed them as if she had made up her mind.\u201cAgain, His Highness has told you not to hide anything and be honest, so don\u2019t worry and try to speak your opinion without hesitation.\u201dJulietta stealthily looked at her employer after the Count winked, as if not to worry. The Count encouraged her, so she studied the mood of her employer, wondering if she could speak what she had thought.Killian had his thoughts occupied all day because of what Julietta had said in the carriage. He had simply accepted the disguise itself, but it struck him as odd to think that she might have had a man. She had clearly said she had lived in disguise to protect herself, but he could not help but wonder if she had been dressed up as she had because of something bad, or if she had really liked someone.As his strangely low spirits did not improve, he was angry that he was preoccupied ahead of such an important business, as the past of the maid was not important.Moreover, he had intentionally changed his route and visited a jewelry store in Beopash. He didn\u2019t like the way he was so unsettled by the mere words of the maid.Killian decided to erase the happening with the maid from his head and focus on his business, wondering how to differentiate his shop from other jewelry shops. However, when Adam winked at the maid and flirted with her, he felt bad again, not realizing that he had decided to stop paying attention to useless things and focus on his original purpose.Adam, who pretended not to see Killian\u2019s face, smiled even more affectionately at Julietta. \u201cI wonder what it looked like in your eyes, as a woman.\u201dJulietta stared at the side of the frowning Killian\u2019s face, then carefully spoke\u2026\u201c\u2026 I grew up in a theater, before working as a maid in the Bertino mansion. So I had a lot of opportunities to see the actresses\u2019 jewelry and fancy dresses. Because they were the actresses of the best theater on the continent, the things that were presented to them were very expensive. Compared to those jewels, I don\u2019t think the jewelry I saw at the store I visited was lagging behind or missing anything. I can\u2019t compare it to an Austern jewelry store, because I\u2019ve never been there before. There\u2019s just one thing that I thought was strange.\u201d\u201cStrange?\u201dFind authorized novels in ReadNovelFull\uff0cfaster updates, better experience\uff0cPlease click www.ReadNovelFull.com for visiting.\u201cWell, I don\u2019t understand why jewelry stores, as well as all the shops, don\u2019t show off what they are selling, but keep them hidden.\u201d\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d\u201cI think we should put the goods on display in front of the window and give those passing by the urge to buy them since can see them. If we keep them hidden like that and show them only to the visitors, we\u2019ll have to sell them only to the people who come. I wondered how he made any business like that.\u201dShe added after bringing up what she had wanted to say, \u201cI think we need to tempt people to buy non-essential luxury items with a more aggressive strategy that makes people want to buy them.\u201dJulietta talked about her many ideas, thinking of many modern advertisements and marketing.\u201cIt\u2019s amazing. I\u2019ve never thought about things so deeply. The way we\u2019ve been selling things has been by the people who need them to come to the store and buy what they want. But we have to encourage people who don\u2019t really need them?\u2026\u201dAdam did not spare any admiration after he got some unexpected information from his throw-off question. Killian looked at Julietta in surprise, too.\u201cHow did you come up with that?\u201d he asked.Julietta happily replied to her employer\u2019s first eye-to-eye question since arriving at the hotel, \u201cI just felt sorry that such a pretty thing was hidden. The hidden beauty that no one knows is worthless.\u201dJulietta recalled the reality that she had been ignored and condemned for her disguise. No matter how beautiful she was, it was of no use if her real beauty was hidden.\u2018When diamonds are just raw materials, they are just stones. Therefore, even the most beautiful things are hidden away, they are no different from trivial things.\u2019Julietta looked at Killian with a touch of emotion as she thought of that.Even with such an ugly and repulsive look, her employer had never been mean or ignored her because of her appearance. He was the only one who didn\u2019t judge her by appearance, though he was picky, nasty and ill-tempered.\u201cYes, you\u2019re right. Beauty that no one knows is worthless. No matter how good a thing I have, what good is it to people if they don\u2019t know?\u201d Killian looked ingeniously at Julietta, forgetting about ignoring her. \u201cHow do you think we should show things off?\u201d\u201cI would lighten up the dark interior of the store at once. I\u2019d put glass on the front so that passersby can look inside. Is glass very expensive and difficult to secure? Is that why other stores can\u2019t use it? Looking at the glass thermos, it won\u2019t be difficult for us to have a secure glass window.\u201dJulietta continued after Killian nodded that it was possible. \u201cIf it can be installed, I\u2019d make a display case in a window close to the street and display the items. Let passersby think they must buy that stuff. It may be expensive, but I think we can accomplish as much as we invest. Jewelry is the best luxury. I would like to change the decor of the room in a luxurious and colorful manner, and let the staff treat the guests with very kind and courteous behavior. It\u2019s a high-end strategy that distinguishes us from other stores, so that the customers who buy things in the store can feel the most special in the world.\u201dKillian admired Julietta\u2019s words. \u201cTo make them feel the most special in the world\u2026\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a saying I know; to sell dreams. By buying things from the store, they feel like they\u2019ve become the most precious, beautiful, and attractive person in the world. I think they should not be arrogant like the shopkeeper we visited today. I\u2019d like to open a store, where buying things from it can be someone\u2019s lifelong dream.\u201dBefore she knew it, Julietta was talking about a store she wanted to open one day.Her appearance as she made an impassioned speech about her dream was glistening and lively to the point that her wild broom-like red hair and unsightly, heavy-looking body were not seen, as she raised her glasses that had dropped down to the tip of her nose.The eyes of the two men, who listened to Julietta\u2019s story in a whirlwind, met. They exchanged glances and tacitly agreed that the opinion of a humble maid should not be ignored unconditionally. Adam smiled meaningfully at Killian and said, \u201cThis new maid of Your Highness seems very capable. Not only was she liked by Your Highness, but she also gave us such a good opinion.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Calen Castle, Part ITranslator: KhanEditor: AelryinthAt Adam\u2019s words, Killian looked at Julietta again.The maid in front of him was truly unique. She was dignified, not servile, and even rude in front of his status and authority, even though she was a maid who did not have a good status and any wealth. It was a wonder that he didn\u2019t like such impudence and did not get angry.It was funny and cute to see her flowing glasses twitching on her nose as he looked at her silently. His low spirits gone, he chuckled. \u201cAll right, it\u2019s a pretty good opinion, so we\u2019ll go ahead with the meeting as soon as we get to Ricaren.\u201d\u201cYes, Your Highness. I think we\u2019ll be very busy this summer. We will have unexpected guests and the new business, and in two months, Ricaren\u2019s broken Magic Square will finally be restored. My heart is pounding, because I think something big is going to happen.\u201dAt Adam\u2019s excited voice, Killian unknowingly hardened his impression.He liked the new business, but he didn\u2019t want the unexpected guests. He was irritated. In addition, if the Magic Square was restored, traveling to and from Austern would be easier, but he would no longer be able to use Calen Castle as a refuge\u2026****************After the meeting and dinner, Killian ordered the maid who was bringing the tea to leave. Adam, disapproved of her face, who went quickly into the Prince\u2019s bedroom without hiding her happy face when he said she could rest.\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cDo you really have a heart for that unworthy ugly girl?\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about? It can\u2019t be!\u201dAdam shook his head at the angry Killian. \u201cIf you like her, sleep with her right away. I hope Your Highness\u2019s attention will cool off before you arrive in Ricaren, but if you don\u2019t think so, I hope you never show off on the surface. You\u2019re going to be on the Emperor\u2019s seat. To sleep with a maid is not a big scar, but it\u2019s not a good thing to look at. What a maid, with such a look! Not only is it perfect for ridicule, but it can also be your weakness. We don\u2019t know what kind of scandal they\u2019re going to create by attaching branches to your taste.\u201dKillian\u2019s eyes glowed coldly on Adam\u2019s cold words. \u201cWhat do you think of me? Do you think I have a heart for a maid? I am dumbfounded.\u201d\u201cNot really? Am I mistaken? That\u2019s a relief. Then I won\u2019t worry about the maid anymore. She has the ability in a business sense, but that doesn\u2019t mean Your Highness needs her.\u201dAdam looked at Killian\u2019s expression and continued on, \u201cI\u2019m relieved to hear that Your Highness doesn\u2019t have much in mind. Then, there is no reason to keep her by your side, so I will get a new maid as soon as I arrive at Ricaren. It is beneath your dignity for a maid of that appearance to serve you.\u201d\u201cNo. I know you\u2019re saying this for me, but I can\u2019t forgive you for saying this or that about my maid. I don\u2019t judge people by their looks. She is good at work, she doesn\u2019t have any other motive and she\u2019s smart. I don\u2019t want to give up anyone who helps me because of just one thing, their appearance, so don\u2019t poke at her.\u201dAdam\u2019s face hardened at Killian\u2019s sharp refusal. After a moment of silence, he spoke again, \u201cAll right, I\u2019m not going to argue about your maid any more. But don\u2019t cover up the maid or show partiality to her in front of others. And when you meet Lady Anais, I hope you show the utmost care and affection for her for the time being.\u201d\u201cWhy should I do that? To keep Francis in check? You know better than anyone that I don\u2019t have to.\u201d\u201cMarquis Anais has not yet expressed his support for Prince Francis. Even a ten-year-old slum boy knows that even though Duchess Anais and the mother of Prince Francis are sisters, they don\u2019t get along very well. Furthermore, there is a rumor that the Marquis abhors the family of Duke Dudley, the Duchess\u2019s parents.\u201dAdam glanced at Killian, who seemed to be lost in thought, and then continued to speak his opinions.\u201cIt\u2019s not exactly clear, but I heard that because of the lover of the Marquis and her illegitimate child, he had a falling-out with the family of the Duke in the past. He doesn\u2019t show anything on the surface, but this story came out of a close aide to the Duke, so it\u2019s not a groundless story. Although he is strictly neutral, if his daughter marries Prince Francis, he will have no choice but to support that side. So before Prince Francis makes a move, you must interrupt them. At the present, Prince Francis and Lady Haint are not in a good relationship. If Your Highness and Lady Anais get closer, it will be very helpful for the nobles on the neutral line to decide where to go.\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t decided to become the Emperor yet. If I make up my mind, I\u2019ll become Emperor without having to organize such a political thing.\u201d\u201cYes. If you make a decision, His Majesty will give you the Crown Prince\u2019s seat immediately. However, Prince Francis and Duke Dudley should not be ignored. Furthermore, Duke Miguel stood on the side of Prince Francis. In addition, don\u2019t forget that Duchess Miguel is the Princess of the Vicern Empire. Because of Duke Miguel, they have formed a force that cannot be overlooked. It\u2019s hard to see what kind of negotiations have been made between Duke Miguel, who has a son who is second in line to the Vicern throne, and Duke Dudley, who has a grandson who is the first in the rank of succession to the throne in Austern. Do not reduce your alertness to the collusion between the two Duke\u2019s Families.\u201dKillian frowned upon hearing of Duke Dudley and Duke Miguel. Perhaps they were the ones who were the most disturbing to his solid road ahead.Adam watched Killian, and continued only then, \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing that Your Highness will have a heart, but if you don\u2019t want to be an Emperor, things will get even more complicated. Who can be the adversary to Prince Francis, except for Your Highness? I understand that you agreed that Prince Francis should not be the Emperor. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d\u201cYes, it is. He won\u2019t let me be when he becomes Emperor, so I\u2019ll have to stop him from being Emperor.\u201dAdam nodded at Killian\u2019s acceptance. \u201cThank you for your understanding. So I trust you will treat Lady Anais with kindness that will never be found again in her life, in order to subdue Prince Francis\u2019 ambition.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d\u201cTries alone are not enough. Promise me you\u2019ll do your best.\u201dKillian\u2019s expression was distorted, but Adam remained unconcerned, since he was nagging under the pretext of loyalty.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-4. Calen CastleThree days later, Julietta and the Prince\u2019s party arrived in Ricaren, the capital of the Principality. It was not comparable to the splendor of Austern, but it was a very beautiful city, with colorful buildings, the clothes of the rich, and well-built roads, which were unique to the Principality of Bertino.Their carriage entered the entrance of Calen Castle as Julietta, fascinated by the strangely peaceful and relaxed urban atmosphere in the midst of the hustle and bustle, stretched out her neck and looked outside. The pre-received knights and guards lined up and waited reverently for their master to arrive.Unlike the burdensomely large and resplendent Imperial Castle of Austern, the Castle of Calen, which glowed calmly in a subtle purple, was a small-scale King\u2019s Castle composed of a towering main keep, one internal one, and three exterior ones.Arriving at the main castle, the carriage door opened, and she could see the subjects, servants, and maids lined up waiting for their master. Not surprisingly, they all bowed their heads in unison.\u201cWelcome back to Calen Castle, Your Highness. You\u2019re looking even better since I last saw you.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

At the peacock-like man\u2019s exaggerated greeting, which gave a different vibe from the servants and maids at first glance, the Prince twitched his mouth. Julietta could not suppress her curiosity about who he was while she was packing a box of tea.\u201cMarquis Oswald, long time no see. You are still noisy.\u201d\u201cNo, this is not noisy, Your Highness. This Oswald is deeply hurt. You don\u2019t know how much I\u2019ve worked for my beauty and elegance.

He had a small accident on the way, so I sent him to Vicern for treatment.\u201d\u201cSo this remarkable lady is serving Your Highness? Is she working temporarily? She looks very interesting.

Why did your head end up in that shape? Did you have some big trouble growing up?\u201dJulietta was startled and stepped back from the strange man looking over her with his soft chocolate-colored eyes closely. As the Marquis stepped closer to her and took her glasses, and Killian ragged him, \u201cThe Marquis, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s time to show interest in my maid. Isn\u2019t there something I need to hear about the guests who are now at the castle?\u201dThe Marquis followed and replied quickly as Killian looked back at Julietta, who had retreated one more step from the close-up Oswald. The men passed through the courteous crowd with their heads down and headed toward the entrance of the main castle.\u201cOh, that\u2019s right, that\u2019s right. Now this Calen Castle is so busy because of the sudden arrival of guests. A series of very complicated situations have happened in a row. As soon as he heard that after Marquis Anais and his daughter arrived, Prince Francis would come, Count Adam ran away without looking back, so Count Valerian and I had to deal with everything in the country.\u201dJulietta flinched at the words \u201cMarquis Anais,\u201d but no one noticed it. Dressed in a dark green jacket, the peacock-like Marquis Oswald raised his hands, looking exaggeratedly up into the sky.\u201cYour Highness, you have to scold Adam. This Oswald, heavily armed with health, almost died from overwork. But who am I? I am your right-hand man, who can handle things with my beautiful appearance and splendid eloquence if a crisis happens. I could cook those nobles of the Austern with one hand, until the Viscountess widow showed up.\u201d\u2018Oh, I suppose you would have been so good.\u2019 Killian, who enthusiastically agreed inwardly with the words of the Marquis who spoke too much, stopped on his way to the words \u2018the Viscountess widow.\u2019\u201cWho is it?\u201d\u201cYour current lover, the Viscountess widow of the Kingdom of Lebatum.\u201dWhen Oswald said that, Killian\u2019s eyes were directed at his own maid without knowing it, who had been following him quietly.A few days ago, after his private life was revealed in a carriage, he came to think differently about the servants and maids who were like furniture in a room and he didn\u2019t care about. And strangely, he was reluctant about the women he had brought to meet in with Julietta.When Julietta, who didn\u2019t know why Killian was looking, stared back at him, Adam coughed loudly.It was a short moment in a few seconds, but Oswald, who noticed something, looked at Adam deliberately. Soon, a river of sighs came out of the mouth of the flashy blonde Marquis.\u201cOh, dear! I never thought anything more complicated could happen here. I need to offer my deepest condolences to Count Valerian, who is now tearing his hair out between the two women.\u201dIgnoring Oswald, who had folded his hands behind his back, busily hanging around in place and sighing out, Killian began searching for Albert among the carriages that followed.\u201cAlbert! Albert!\u201dThe servants and maids, who lined up in a row, were flustered with amazement at the yell of their returned owner, and the nervous knights busily encircled him.\u201cYour Highness, let\u2019s go in now. I\u2019ll bring Sir Albert to you as soon as he arrives.\u201dAs Adam looked back and advised, Oswald also helped. \u201cYes, Your Highness. Count Valerian is dying to deal with Lady Anais and the Viscountess widow, who would like to come to greet you as soon as you arrive. How hard it must be to deal with the two with his blunt personality! This Oswald begs you to go in and make your decision on how to deal with it, and to save the poor Count from the depths of hell.\u201dJulietta was surprised to see the gaudy blonde man talking constantly in spite of the Prince\u2019s anger.She felt as if she\u2019d been walking on ice these past few days because of her employer, who had kept some distance from her after Beopash.Although she had even begged for forgiveness for her mistake, she felt a little disappointed at the thought that he might still be upset. However, upon arriving at Calen Castle, she realized that she had been under a great illusion. This was because she forgot the status of her employer, who was royalty, and felt comfortable for a while.Seeing so many people bowing to a single Prince, she found out what a great man she was working for. She was starting to feel a little depressed and worried about whether she could stand up well in this job.But when she saw the man who was constantly chattering about like a peacock, she felt strangely energized. A man like that didn\u2019t fit in with a stiff, formal atmosphere seemed to say, \u2018You can stay here,\u2019 to herself, who was at a loss because she felt like she was somewhere she shouldn\u2019t be.Julietta raised her head confidently. There would be no reason for her to not work if that kind of man worked as a close aide to the Prince. At the words of the peacock, it seemed that the Prince\u2019s latest lover, who had bothered her so much, had come to this place. If she took duty in the bedroom of the Prince again, she would have to go through all the complaints and grumbling of the Viscountess widow who had slapped her face.Killian glanced at Julietta, and sighed, thinking, I\u2019ve been comfortable, but now it\u2019s over, and ordered Adam, \u201cGet Albert right away as soon as he arrives.\u201d******\u201c\u2026 So the parties of the Marquis and of the Viscountess Morbido are staying in Rezen Castle. When Prince Francis arrives, he is expected to go to Nas Castle, and when the other nobles arrive, they will be taken to Lona Castle, and inevitably the two parties have to be driven into Rezen Castle. Thanks to that, every day is a war.\u201dOswald sighed in exaggeration, and after finishing his speech, didn\u2019t care about the eyes of the others who were staring at him, but lifted the teacup in front of him and gracefully sniffed it. Killian\u2019s cold eyes were directed at Albert.\u201cAlbert, how did you manage the whole thing? Didn\u2019t you make it clear to the Viscountess?\u201dAlbert began to complain, wiping the sweat he didn\u2019t have with his handkerchief, \u201cYour Highness, I have repeatedly told her and indeed conveyed your will and sent a great farewell gift to Morbido\u2019s mansion. But as always, there\u2019s no way I can control the reckless behavior of those who don\u2019t want to accept your intentions.\u201dWhen the Prince declared the last time, most of the women persistently demanded a meeting because they could not accept the parting. There were those who searched for all the places he could go, and even camped out in front of the Bertino mansion on Harrods Street. By the time the Prince, who had ignored them completely and regardless of their waiting, visited Harrods Street again to meet his new lover, their grueling wait and lingering sorrow would come to an end.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Calen Castle, Part IIITranslator: KhanEditor: AelryinthIt was obvious that this time, the Viscountess Morbido must have hurt her self-esteem even more, as she had been dumped after meeting only twice after being given the job of the Prince\u2019s lover. But as Albert was admiring her, thinking it was not normal to follow this far to distant Bertino, Killian\u2019s anger was gradually rising to the ceiling of the Oval Office.\u201cSo now that there\u2019s no way to control the behavior of the women, it\u2019s inevitable that they\u2019ve come all this way and we can\u2019t help, but let it go?\u201dAlbert was so pricked by Killian\u2019s increasingly low voice that he hurriedly waved his hand and denied it. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen. I will do my best to keep them out of sight of Your Highness by any means possible. How dare they come here without your permission! Mr. Marquis Oswald, I am very disappointed. You\u2019re holding the Viscountess widow of the Kingdom of Lebatum in an exterior castle where Lady Anais, the daughter of Marquis Anais is staying, the Marquis of Anais. Why did you handle it like that?\u201dOswald, who was enjoying his tea gracefully, jumped when Albert\u2019s grudges turned to him.\u201cNo, Sir Albert, how could I have known that the Viscountess widow had been dumped by His Highness after only a month? I knew it was by the permission of His Highness because she came here calling herself a lover of His Highness. But, Your Highness, was the widow so unattractive? Isn\u2019t it almost a new record that you dumped a lover in a month?\u201dJulietta, standing in the corner, burst into laughter at Oswald\u2019s serious question, regardless of the feelings of Killian, and then quickly covered it up with a cough.She tried, but the situation was so funny that she couldn\u2019t stand it. Of the five people in this room, only her employer was serious.Count Adam listened to the conversation and nodded dryly, while Marquis Oswald looked happy to die with this situation, and Sir Albert complained so and so, and wiped his forehead with his handkerchief as if the Prince had to bear it, since it had already happened.At first glance, it seemed that Lady Anais, who had arrived similarly to the Viscountess widow, was what they thought was a reserved Queen. In other words, a smiling situation had occurred in which a former lover and a woman who would be his fianc\u00e9 had met in one place. Nevertheless, the other closest aides, except for the Prince, were saying, \u201cThis is a big deal,\u201d making it difficult for Julietta to hold back her laughter, as she seemed to be watching a sitcom.She covered her mouth with her hands, acting as if she had a cough, but it was too late. When the Prince\u2019s gaze, which seemed to be overturned at any moment, turned to the maid standing in the corner, Albert ducked his head without realizing it. Even though the new maid had not arrived yet, he wondered who in the Castle of Calen should be chosen as a new maid of His Highness.Even if Count Adam managed Bertino Castle and the Principality, it was not easy to investigate every single person among the maids. Moreover, he didn\u2019t intend to trust the maids who were hired without his okay. He was anxious to relieve His Highness\u2019s anger before that maid was kicked out, but his master, who had hit even the sofa\u2019s armrest with the case of the Viscountess widow, suddenly uttered in a strange voice.\u201cI think I haven\u2019t had lunch yet. You should go eat and come back. Albert, take Julietta to the next room to stay in the future and get her a meal. Oh, you can eat, too. We\u2019ll continue to have meetings and ask other maids to bring us something simple to eat.\u201dAlbert frowned at the master\u2019s behavior of taking care of the lunch of the maid, and Adam sighed, as if he had given up. Albert took Julietta out with him, his face complicated by the behavior of his increasingly unknown master these days.Oswald, looking back and forth between them, opened his mouth with amusement, \u201cYour Highness, will you give her the room Jeff used to use? It looks like the new maid is in your confidence. I should also look good to the maid!\u201d\u201cPlease tell Valerian to come here, don\u2019t just beat your gums. And invite Marquis Anais and his party to dinner.\u201dAfter asking Oswald to invite Marquis Anais to the dinner to be laid out for the monarch who had returned after a few months, he stopped talking, and Oswald reminded him about something his monarch had forgotten.\u201cWhat about the Viscountess Morbido?\u201d\u201cGet her out of the castle right now. Let her know that no one can stay in Bertino without my permission. And if this happens again, keep in mind that I have no choice but to judge you as too incompetent to keep close to me.\u201dAs Killian stared coolly, the two bowed politely and asked for forgiveness, contrary to the atmosphere so far.******Julietta put down the luggage she was carrying in a side chamber to the bedroom of the Prince, the owner of Calen Castle.The room she would stay in was a small one, connected to a dressing room and having no windows, but it was equipped with nearly everything. There was a table, a chair, and even a small closet on one side of the wall, and a bed that looked quite fluffy.In addition, the side room was decorated in ivory and blue, just like the castle owner\u2019s bedroom, and the interior looked so refreshing. Julietta stamped her feet excitedly at her increasingly developed home.A small but clean maid\u2019s room on Harrods Street, or one side of the Eileen Theater\u2019s prop room, which was hard to lay down in, stacked with fabric and clothes\u2026 But now, for a while, she would stay in a room with tables and closets, and a bed.Most of all, she was so happy that she could get away from sleeping on a blanket on the bedside floor next to her employer\u2019s bed.Julietta put down the box of tea, which she held more carefully than her luggage, took out the glass bottle she had hung around her neck, and carefully put it in the box.Then she slowly sent her entire fortune, two dresses and pajamas, several belongings and a box of tea, into the closet, and then left the room, dancing around and around. She even greeted the hateful knights that Albert had introduced her to, and walked as if she were flying.It seemed to be smaller than the castle of the Crown Prince in Austern, which she had gone in for a while before departing for Bertino. She came out looking around the interior of Calen Castle. As Albert informed her, she could easily find the dining room attached to the servants and maids\u2019 quarters behind the main castle.As if it was a lie that she had just been excited and whirling around, Julietta cautiously opened the door of the dining room and stepped in, nervous about how the new people who she was supposed to face for a while would accept her. However, her tension was useless, because the inside of the dining room was empty.Even if it was well past lunchtime, it was hard to eat on time, as it depended on the work of a maid, unlike the aristocrats who ate on time. For this reason, Harrods\u2019 dining room always had simple snacks or loaves of bread on the table, and inside the kitchen was a pot of stew or soup that could be heated all the time.Unlike Harrods\u2019 kitchen, which was always bustling and noisy to prepare for the next meal, there was no indication of a person being around the kitchen inside the dining room, and Julietta thought about what to do. If she had to fend for herself at mealtime, she had to adjust to the Prince\u2019s schedule, and she could hardly have dinner for herself.After going into the cold kitchen and rummaging for leftovers, she had to give up her lunch. She had no choice but to leave the dining room for now, thinking she should ask Sir Albert what to do later.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Calen Castle, Part IVTranslator: KhanEditor: AelryinthAfter patting her empty stomach to console herself, she left the maid\u2019s quarters and was heading back to the main castle, where a shrill voice called out from behind her, \u201cWho\u2019s there? I haven\u2019t seen you before. What are you doing here?\u201dIt was the head maid of Calen Castle, the Baroness Pamela Lanolf.Pamela was on edge from nerves.Due to the complaints of the Viscountess, a lover of the Prince, she had been called to Rezen Castle since morning, so she could not come out to greet the Prince, the ruler of the Principality. Moreover, it was nerve-wracking to think of meeting Sir Albert, the Grand Chamberlain, who did not like her.Pamela barely comforted the Viscountess, thinking that the old man would soon retire and that her nephew, Jeff, would soon be the Grand Chamberlain, and then she would get out of this boring war of nerves.Immediately after that, she put behind her the maids, who she carried with her to greet her returned Prince, and headed to the Oval Office of the main castle, where she was told the Prince was. A maid she saw for the first time was wandering about. There was no chance of a stranger entering the heavily guarded main castle, so she could only be one of the members of the returned owner\u2019s party, but she couldn\u2019t think of her as a member of the party by any means after looking at her thick appearance from behind.Though she had a long way to go, the Baroness, who thought she should clarify where she belonged in order to prevent any accidents that might occur, called out to the big maid in front of her. When she saw the maid turn around, she opened her mouth in astonishment, and the maids who followed her made a fuss.\u201cDid you call me?\u201d As soon as she turned around and saw the women with disapproving faces, Julietta slowly began to get irritated by the repeated reactions.\u2018Don\u2019t they know how foolish it is to judge a person only by their looks?\u2019She managed to clamp her mouth shut as it twisted, as they were shocked that someone like her had ever appeared where she was not supposed to be.It was a moment before Julietta tried to introduce herself after bowing as politely as possible according to etiquette, as Johanna, the head maid of Harrods Street, had taught her. The woman in front of her suddenly got angry.\u201cOh, my God! How could this happen? How did someone like you get into this castle? Where the hell do you belong to?\u201dIf she had just waited a little while, she would have answered well, but she had interrupted her speech and she felt something even worse. Julietta, though, politely announced her affiliation.\u201cI am Julietta Salmon, who is serving His Highness Killian of Austern, the master of Bertino.\u201dOnce again, the Baroness made a further grimace, looking on as she casually twitched, raising her glasses that had come down to the tip of her nose as she bowed deeply.\u201cI am really dumbfounded. How could a maid like you serve His Highness? This could be fatal to his dignity. What the hell did Sir Albert do? I\u2019m sure he\u2019s done something so ridiculous like this, believing in the favor of His Highness. I\u2019ll tell His Highness about this situation right away.\u201dShe had been offended by the look of freaking eyes for awhile, as if they were seeing a monster carrying an infectious disease. Julietta, who felt as if she was guilty of the Baroness\u2019 criticism, stood helplessly at her wits\u2019 end.\u201cWhat are you doing? Make sure you stay in your quarters until there\u2019s another order, so people do not see you.\u201dJulietta sighed unconsciously.This was not her true self, but she could not help being hurt by the eyes of those who were shocked and disgusted every time they saw her. Now she did not think that if she took off this disguise\u2026 It really hurt her heart to think that her disguised appearance was her true self.After she bowed to the noble lady with a ferocious expression in front of her, Julietta turned around and a maid of the Baroness, Celine, opened her mouth.\u201cHow could she work as a maid of His Highness in that shape? Sir Albert was very strict about this and that, and he harassed the head maid, but did he really pick her as a maid? This is a strong case to appeal to His Highness.\u201dAs if to console the surprised Baroness, Celine spoke ill of the maid she had just seen, and Rosalyn, the other maid, also agreed enthusiastically.\u201cI think Sir Albert\u2019s eyes are terrible when I see the maid changing every time His Highness returns. As His Highness had not liked them, he must have changed them every time. Jeff, a nephew of the head maid, needs to take over as the Grand Chamberlain\u2019s seat.\u201dJeff, who was her nephew, was not a nobleman, because the man her sister had married was a titled man, not landed. However, Pamela had worked as a maid of Duchess Irene, the mother of the Prince, and was knighted by her own ability, so she was able to rise to the position of the head maid of Calen Castle.The first thing she had done as soon as she had become the head maid was to put her nephew as the Prince\u2019s servant. Unlike the Prince\u2019s private maids, who were changed from time to time, Jeff had been in the position of the Prince\u2019s servant for several years, being protected by Pamela.Now, when the old Sir Albert retired, Jeff would succeed him at his post of the grand chamberlain. That way, Jeff could get the title of Baronet and she could really be the number one of Calen Castle, without having to read the faces of Sir Albert or any other grand chamberlain.The maid from a moment ago was a golden opportunity to express Sir Albert\u2019s incompetence to the Baroness with such a goal. So she had made more fuss, as if something big had happened.With a smile of satisfaction, Pamela hurried to the Oval Office to meet the Prince.\u201cYour Highness, welcome back. Please forgive my disloyalty that I happened not to meet Your Highness, since I had something to work on in Rezen Castle.\u201dKillian frowned at the head maid and the maids who accompanied her, and who glanced up and bowed to him as if they were shy. At his mother\u2019s recommendation, he gave her the title and allowed her to serve as a head maid, but Killian didn\u2019t like her, as she always seemed to be calculating and greedy.\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time, Baroness Lanolf.\u201dPamela rushed to speak, as if to attract the attention of the Prince, who nodded dryly and looked away, \u201cYour Highness, I met your private maid. You don\u2019t know how surprised I was to see her.\u201dHe looked at the Baroness again at the words \u2018your private maid\u2019, after he had turned away after he had apathetically received her greeting.Marquis Oswald and Count Adam, who did not pay much attention to Pamela\u2019s greeting, were also interested in what happened. When Pamela drew the attention she wanted, she stopped talking to create a dramatic effect and held her hand near her heart as if surprised.\u201cHow hideous the appearance of a maid who serves Your Highness can be! I was so surprised at how Sir Albert could keep such a maid beside Your Highness. I was so worried if it was time for him to retire.\u201dThe maids who stood behind the Baroness looked at each other, as if it were truly impossible. Count Adam sprang up at the sight of Killian, who watched without a word.\u201cOh, the Baroness! The former maid quit in a hurry, and Jeff\u2019s accident overlapped, so she was to serve as a temporary maid for the time being. It\u2019s not Sir Albert\u2019s fault.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean by \u2018an accident\u2019? Where did Jeff get hurt?! That\u2019s why I can\u2019t see him now!\u201dAdam interrupted the Baroness\u2019s words as she forgot that she was in front of the Prince and made a great fuss about trifles in surprise. \u201cI don\u2019t know the details, so listen carefully to Sir Albert later. Anyway, that\u2019s all the circumstances that led the maid to serve His Highness.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Calen Castle, Part VTranslator: KhanEditor: AelryinthPamela continued to speak out, regardless of Adam\u2019s efforts to leave before the anger of the Prince, who would grow particularly sharp for this maid.\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, I can\u2019t leave a girl like that as a maid of His Highness. I\u2019ll get another maid ready as soon as possible.\u201dThe Baroness\u2019s needless, strong determination made Adam unwittingly look back at Killian.\u2018Your Highness, don\u2019t forget what I said.\u2019As Killian\u2019s fierce look did not ease despite the Count\u2019s serious look, Marquis Oswald broke in with a smile, \u201cCome on, the head maid, all the personal affairs of His Highness are Sir Albert\u2019s business, so don\u2019t worry about it and do what you have to do. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re very busy getting ready for dinner tonight. Can you just hang around here like this? If there are any mistakes, Sir Albert will try to pull out all your gray hairs.\u201dThe Baroness opened her mouth to refute Marquis Oswald, who didn\u2019t always call her by her title, but as a head maid, and was unctuous and greasy. But before she could, one of Killian\u2019s hands went up.\u201cStop. It\u2019s Albert\u2019s job to manage my maids. Even the Count and the Marquis here can\u2019t say anything about that. That\u2019s the right of the grand chamberlain, who I ennobled, to do. Do you understand what I mean?\u201dUnlike the concerns of Adam and Oswald, Killian was not excited. He only looked coldly at her, daring her to rebel against his words.At the Prince\u2019s gaze, Pamela had no choice but to step back. With the appearance of the young maid, it did not seem to shake the Prince\u2019s faith and trust in Albert.If so, she would have to force the maid to make a big mistake and shake his faith. Pamela thought, Let\u2019s see if your faith is firm, even if you are troubled by the maid chosen by the grand chamberlain who you trust to such an extent.******************Marquis Anais looked out of the window at the lake with his hands folded behind his back.A pair of white swans were feeding each other with their beaks, the water\u2019s surface shining transparently in the bright sun. Between them, a baby swan broke in as if it were jealous. The mother swan spread her wings and held her baby, and began pecking and polishing the feathers of her baby with her beak. At the affectionate gesture, the Marquis\u2019s expressionless face was distorted with grief.He remembered one day when they had been really happy. He and his wife had been feeding each other, and his daughter tried to get in between her parents and opened her mouth to ask for food for herself.\u2018Stella, Julietta\u2026\u2019His lover and his young daughter\u2019s whereabouts were unknown after being evicted from their mansion overnight, while he had been attending a ceremony for the Crown Prince of the Vicern Empire.He had returned to Austern and belatedly found out about it, and gone frantically searching for them. But it had been Stella\u2019s body that he had encountered half a year later.The man who had brought the body had said that she had died following the death of her young daughter, who had been unable to overcome her grief. Also, they had only found Stella, who had been already dead, so there had been no way to know where she had buried her daughter.The Marquis could never forgive his wife Ivana, who had taken Stella and Julietta from him. He was distressed because he couldn\u2019t give any affection to the daughter and son she gave birth to.Whenever he saw Christine, who had been born a few months earlier than Julietta, hatred and sorrow were intertwined and gnawed at his spirit.He showed her his best to listen to what Christine wanted, as he could not give her love, and they praised him as a loving father. The Marquis felt guilty about it, but he had no intention of revealing it to others.He was only full of revenge against Ivana. His vengeance went so far as to include the family of Duke Dudley, who had pressured him into marrying Ivana.When he had strengthened his need for vengeance, Christine, who had an unrequited love for the fifth Prince, had asked him to visit the Principality of Bertino. He had decided to go to Bertino, pretending he couldn\u2019t endure the hard teasing of Christine.This was a golden opportunity to break down Ivana\u2019s plan, which would approve even if she sacrificed her daughter for the crown of Francis, her nephew, even though she was not getting along with her sister, the first Queen. By granting his daughter\u2019s wish that she should marry Prince Bertino, there was no better way to split the family of Duke Dudley from the family of Marquis Anais.So far, even if he had been firmly neutral, he could not ignore the family of Dudley, since he had married Ivana. But if Christine were to marry the fifth Prince, he would naturally be able to confront the family of Dudley head on, empowering his son-in-law. The Marquis closed his eyes for a while and calmed his vengeful heart, still thinking about what would happen.A little commotion was happening in the reception hall of Rezen Castle when Marquis Anais recalled the past and planned to paint the future with vengeance.\u201cHis Highness has arrived here, why did you stop me from greeting him?\u201dChristine struggled to maintain her affable and graceful attitude as a lady of the Marquis, and forced a smile.It was her first love for twelve years since she had fallen in love with Killian at first sight when she had visited the Imperial Castle to meet her aunt Victoria, the first Queen. She\u2019d been waiting for this for a long time, dreaming of the day when she would become his bride after her coming of age.Christine, who finally made her social debut this year to celebrate her much-awaited seventeenth birthday, was finally able to formally introduce herself to Killian, whom she had met at the Emperor\u2019s birthday banquet. Seeing Killian right in front of her, who she had only seen before in the distance, she fell in love with him once again.Christine was lucky. She ducked around the side of Killian, who gave her an insipid nod despite her shy and innocent greetings, and when he talked to Marquis Rhodius about his scheduled visit to the Principality of Bertino, she heard and thought up a trick.After interrupting their conversation tactlessly, as if she were an immature and innocent lady, she managed to get an invitation from Marquis Rhodius instead of the ignorant Prince Killian.\u201cIf you\u2019d like to go there, visit him when you have time later. He\u2019ll be happy at your visit, too.\u201dThe Prince glared at the Marquis inviting her, but Christine didn\u2019t care. She was only happy that she finally had a chance to gain the upper hand among her countless competitors.Christine seized on the invitation to the Principality of Bertino, even if it was a mere invitation, and began to prepare for the trip from then on. It was only after hearing that the Prince and his party were ready to leave for the Principality of Bertino that she was able to arrive at Calen Castle before Killian, asking for her father, the Marquis.Christine had no intention of being used as a tool to make her cousin Francis the Crown Prince, as planned by her maternal grandfather, Duke Dudley, and her mother, Marquise Anais. Duke Dudley was in the process of choosing a family to marry his granddaughter to in order to enlist those marital bonds. Marrying someone she didn\u2019t know for Francis she absolutely refused.Rather, she thought that Francis and her maternal grandfather\u2019s ambitions would die down if she married Killian, the most likely Crown Prince. Then she would take the man she loved and become the Empress of the future, and Francis would never be hanging on to the unlikely crown in the first place, hastening his death.She arrived at Calen Castle a few days ago with such swollen dreams. But Christine was soon hit by a difficult situation, being confronted by a shallow woman who was his lover.The reason why she ran to Calen Castle, where the Magic Square was not connected, was to win Killian\u2019s heart in a place where there was no rival in love. But there was also a competitor here!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Calen Castle, Part VITranslator: KhanEditor: AelryinthShe\u2019d heard so many things about his women, but when she checked them with her own eyes, Christine couldn\u2019t hide her shock. But the shock was only there for a while before she could not bear her, as she saw a woman who put on airs, as if she knew everything about the Prince.What was more, they had that foolish woman and Lady Anais stay in the same outer castle. Her pride was hurt and she couldn\u2019t bear it, but she had to, not showing any signs of her anger.Christine had been very careful to say nothing, to show herself as a future Empress worthy of marrying Killian, and behaving with generosity and affection for everybody. In addition, she had tried to spread her personality and thoughtfulness all over the place by volunteering for those in need. She couldn\u2019t ruin all her efforts, which she had worked extremely hard at from such an early age, with such a trifle.Even at this moment, Christine ignored the Viscountess Morbido, who coquettishly fanned herself while sitting opposite her, and asked Count Valerian why he would stop her from greeting His Highness.One of Killian\u2019s closest aides, Charl Eber Valerian, was impressed with the Lady Anais, who hid her venomous nature and asked things in a very amiable way.These past few days he\u2019d been called to Rezen Castle every time he opened his eyes. The guest service was originally supposed to be done by Count Adam, who was in charge of managing the administration and the Business Group of the Principality after being appointed to the Principality of Bertino. But after Count Adam had fled early, Valerian had arrived in Bertino a month ago to prepare for the summer hunting competition with Marquis Oswald, who was in charge of managing the Prince\u2019s finances, and who had ended up managing the two women\u2019s fight for days, preventing them from crossing the fence.Valerian had missed a chance to escape when Marquis Oswald, who had been always dealing with the two women in a relaxed manner, had left saying that he should meet the Prince upon arrival. Valerian was left alone and trying to stay alert.There was not a whole lot of difference between them, but when asked by Lady Anais, who did not lose her elegant demeanor on the outside, he answered in with maximum kindness, as he gave her better marks than the Viscountess Morbido.\u201cLady Anais, an outsider is not acceptable in the inner castle. The gates that are connected to the main castle for the visits of those who are not members of Calen Castle are only opened when the owner\u2019s permission is given. You\u2019ll have to wait until you have the permission of His Highness to meet him.\u201d\u201cHumph, Lady Anais is an outsider, but I\u2019m not, am I? I don\u2019t know why I have to be bound by such rules.\u201dValerian, who didn\u2019t know yet that the Viscountess had been dumped by Killian, had to go through a difficult situation each time, not knowing which side he had to take between Lady Anais, who said she had been invited by the Prince, and the Viscountess, who said she was the current lover of the Prince.As soon as Viscountess Morbido finished speaking, Christine had upward slanting eyes. Although she had been hiding her original temper to impress the Count, she was irritated when she was treated as an outsider. After seeing her poignant look, Valerian looked up at the ceiling and sought the God he had never believed in.Lady Anais was widely praised for her aristocratic dignity despite her young age, and for her good spirit and wisdom that could not pass by the needy. But as he had been through these days, he had only felt that rumors were not trustworthy. He didn\u2019t know who had spread the rumors, but he just wanted to show them how venomous her expression was now.While Lady Anais and the Viscountess were fighting a silent war, Marquis Oswald returned after greeting the Prince and reporting on what had happened to him. Valerian leapt up in delight. At the welcome, Marquis Oswald patted him on the shoulder without a word, as if he understood.\u201cHas His Highness arrived well?\u201dThe Marquis nodded at Valerian\u2019s question. \u201cI had seen him earlier this year and saw him again after a few months, but he\u2019s gotten better. I think there\u2019s been a funny thing going on.\u201d\u201cA funny thing?\u201d\u201cOh, you\u2019ll find out about that soon. Let\u2019s start with what I had to come back here. Lady Anais, where is Marquis Anais?\u201dAt the words of Marquis Oswald, Christine answered with excitement, thinking that she could finally go see Killian. \u201cMy father is resting in his room right now. May I have him come?\u201d\u201cNo, please deliver my words to him. A welcome dinner for His Highness will be held as scheduled in the evening, so please attend. I\u2019ll send you a carriage to the main castle when it\u2019s time for dinner.\u201dAs soon as the Marquis finished speaking, Viscountess Morbido said, folding her fan. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to get ready, too. I thought you\u2019d have dinner tomorrow, judging from the character of His Highness. I have to show him my most beautiful appearance, but I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m running out of time.\u201dWhen the Viscountess, who purposely looked at Christine with a smile of intimacy with the Prince, busily headed for the door, Marquis Oswald sadly held her back.\u201cOh, Viscountess Morbido, did I mention that you are allowed to attend the dinner? Unfortunately, His Highness was very angry at your unannounced visit. I was reprimanded for having you stay in Calen Castle without confirmation. I have worked really hard to calm his anger. So, I\u2019d like you to go back to your room and get ready to leave the castle.\u201dShe spoke as if she could not believe Oswald\u2019s cold, hard instruction which was contrary to his usual cynicism. \u201cWhat do you mean? You mean His Highness doesn\u2019t want to see me now?\u201dViscountess Morbido stared at the Marquis who had ordered her deportation, shaking as if she could not believe it.A month after becoming the Prince\u2019s lover, she had received a huge parting gift with the message that he would no longer look for her, but she didn\u2019t think it was his real intention. She thought there must be some other reason, and if she was really abandoned, she\u2019d better find out who the Prince\u2019s new woman was.What she had found out by mobilizing all her social connections was that the Prince used to visit the Principality of Bertino every early summer, but this year he would leave earlier because of his planned business. When she heard that, she thought that the Prince\u2019s sudden parting message was made out of regret that he would not take her to Bertino.She had only met him twice, but she had no choice but to think about it because he was so wonderful, so ecstatic and so hot that she couldn\u2019t imagine he was bored with her. To her, who had no intention of accepting a parting notice with no warning signs at all, the Prince\u2019s early visit to Bertino came as a plausible reason.Quickly finding out further that the Prince had not taken another lover, she was convinced that she was right and visited Bertino in the hope of surprising him. After a long trip, she spent every day thinking about how happy and how hotly he would hug her if he met her.Although she was offended by Lady Anais unexpectedly, it was hard for her to become the wife of the Crown Prince with her own status. Though she was jealous and angry, she decided to settle for the position of a concubine, thinking that the marriage of Lady Anais, who had even visited Bertino, and the Prince would be a fait accompli.However, she did not want to be pushed around by Lady Anais, who behaved as if she saw something dirty whenever she saw her, so she was fighting without conceding.As a result, the words given by Marquis Oswald were shocking to her. Unable to believe it, she thought it was clear that that rascal, who had hated her from the start, had told the Prince strange words. He must have prevented her presence from becoming an obstacle to his marriage to the noble lady of Anais.\u201cLet me see His Highness, please. If he tells me to go out, I\u2019ll believe you.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Calen Castle, Part VIITranslator: KhanEditor: AelryinthOswald sighed when he saw a woman in front of him, who intentionally used thin fabrics to make the fabric stick to her whole body, and whose exposed dress was beautiful, but overflowing with vulgarity.\u201cHoo, the Viscountess. I think you\u2019re mistaken. Nothing that comes out of my mouth is without the thoughts of His Highness. As I said, his intentions are in line with my message, so be ready. The maids of Rezen Castle are helping your maid pack your things, so as soon as you are ready, you must leave the castle. I want you to know that if you hold out, it will be enforced.\u201dOswald called in the knights who were standing outside with the warning.\u201cAs soon as the Viscountess has gone into her room and is ready, take her out of the castle. Everything has to be done within an hour from now.\u201dAt the direction of the Marquis, knights surrounded her. She began to calculate quickly. At this rate, she might be dragged out in a very ugly way, but she thought it was not too bad.It would seem more plausible to be surrounded by knights than to leave the gate in a shabby manner without anyone sending them off. On the surface, they would not know whether these knights were mobilized to make her go, or to see her off. If she were to take advantage of this situation, she could create a plausible situation for later on.\u2018If I can\u2019t hope for any more future for Prince Killian anyway, shouldn\u2019t I use the situation to find another plausible person?\u2019Oswald sighed loudly as she held onto her seat.\u201cMadame, I warned you clearly. Let\u2019s take her right to the carriage.\u201dTwo knights bowed politely to the Viscountess at Oswald\u2019s command, and raised her by holding both arms. She pretended to rebel and was taken to the carriage. A moment later, as soon as her maid came with her mistress\u2019s hat and sat down opposite her, the carriage set off.\u201cHis Highness is so mean. I don\u2019t even remember how I packed it.\u201dThe maid was moved to tears when she had to be prepared to leave in a hurry under the eyes of the scary knights.\u201cShut up! Give me my hat.\u201dAfter putting on the hat handed to her by the maid, she looked out through the carriage window. Knights wearing two emblems of the Principality of Bertino and Prince Killian had surrounded the carriage she was riding. She looked pleased sy the sight and leaned back comfortably in the seat.\u201cI\u2019ll go back to Austern first and look forward to the future. No one will think I was kicked out by the Prince with this much for an escort, except Anais.\u201cHuh, Lady Anais is totally different from the rumors. Those who believe that she is generous and kind, and she is the right person to be the Empress in the future, would never say that if they find out what she really is like.\u201dShe nodded to the maid who had been emotionally hurt in the war of nerves that lasted for days.\u201cThat\u2019s right. I can stand for anything else, but I can\u2019t see that bitch pompous in the future. I\u2019m going to have to take revenge for what she\u2019s done to me in the meantime.\u201dThe Viscountess had a dark and damp smile, thinking, You wait and see\u2026**********At that time, Julietta came back to the room at the command of a noble lady, who was acting like a superintendent of a dormitory.Though her makeup was a little too serious, she had not hurt others and was bored by the fact that everyone was treating her like an infectious patient. She was worried that she might get into an accident sooner or later after her mood had so many highs and lows, even though she suffered every time. She just waited for Killian\u2019s new maid to come as soon as possible.Julietta was unaware that Killian was going to send back the new maid who she had been waiting with a yearning so long, and was alone in thinking how long she would wait to go back to Harrods Street.\u201cJulietta.\u201d She heard a voice calling her from outside. It seemed like a long time had passed before the Prince returned to his room. As she was hurrying out, the door linked to the dressing room burst open.Killian looked around the room where Julietta was staying. As he thought the room was too small for a huge dressing room, he asked without thinking deeply, \u201cIsn\u2019t the room too small? It doesn\u2019t even have a window, so it feels stuffy.\u201dJulietta shook her head hard, thinking that her employer might be trying to take away her own space again.\u201cNo, I really like it. I\u2019ve never had such a nice room. I\u2019m really satisfied with the bed, the table, and the closet.\u201dAlthough she seemed to have lived a splendid life under the protection of Marquis Anais, she decided to think that her past before the age of five was not her life. She decided to remain aloof about the guests who were staying in the outer castle.Killian nodded helplessly when he saw Julietta, who answered strongly that she really liked it. If she didn\u2019t like it, he would try to renovate the dressing room, but it was just as well that she liked it so much.\u201cGet ready for a bath. We are tight before dinner time in the evening, so hurry up.\u201dWhen Killian went out, leaving an order, Julietta breathed a sigh of relief that she had kept the room.As she hurried to the bathroom to prepare for the bath, now accustomed to it, Killian thought for a moment, looking at her ample disguise from behind.He had already heard a lot of words about the appearance of his maid. He wanted to keep her out of sight as much as possible, but to do so, he had to have another servant or a maid beside him.The reason why he had so far put up with Jeff was that he hated the presence of unreliable people around him.Although he did know Jeff\u2019s insidiousness and nasty character, he had not been very intrusive until this time, and above all, he was the nephew of Baroness Lanolf, who had worked as his mother\u2019s maid.He finally found his favorite maid, but the meddling of the people around him was quite annoying. Furthermore, Killian was deeply offended by the head maid\u2019s attitude, daring to point out Albert\u2019s incompetence in front of him.\u2014\u2014-At that time, Baroness Ranolf, who had supplied that situation, was listening to the news of Jeff\u2019s accident from Sir Albert.\u201cWhat? Do you mean that ugly thing threw hot water on Jeff?\u201d\u201cThe Baroness, don\u2019t say anything to create trouble. When did I say that? In preparing tea for His Highness, Jeff was burned by a small wagon accident. His Highness confirmed that there was no intention of that.\u201d\u201cThe face of the ugly must be filled with hot water, why did it spill over into our Jeff\u2019s face? Was it really an accident? His Highness didn\u2019t see it wrong, did he?\u201dAlbert was very angry at Pamela, who was so excited that she didn\u2019t know what she should not say.\u201cIf you want to hold out for a long time on the seat, I hope you won\u2019t say such insufficient words again. I\u2019ll pass on this once, but once again, you\u2019ll have to leave the castle if I hear this again.\u201dAs Albert glared and yelled at her, Pamela bit down on her protest, which was about to burst out of her. It was because she knew that such a strong and straight old man would really do that if he wanted to.\u201cYes, Sir Albert. I was sorry for my nephew who had been injured, so my tongue slipped. Please forgive me.\u201dAlbert nodded reluctantly at the appearance of an apology.As she managed to calm down her bubbling mind and reported on dinner preparations for the evening banquet, Pamela thought, I need to kick out that unpleasant maid right away.******Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Calen Castle, Part VIIITranslator: KhanEditor: AelryinthThe banquet hall in Calen Castle was opened after a year\u2019s silence.Killian sat at the long tabletop in the middle of the hall. At the right of him was the family of Anais, and on the opposite side was Marquis Oswald, Count Adam, and Count Valerian. The rest of the seats were occupied by Bertino nobles.The diners cleaned up the fish dishes and were served the main dishes. Marquis Oswald, who glimpsed the private servants of the nobles and the maids waiting beside the wall, asked when the hall fell into disorder, \u201cI don\u2019t see the maid of Your Highness. Where did she go?\u201dKillian\u2019s face frowned disapprovingly at the question, but Oswald was just waiting for an answer, with no regard for him.\u201cI asked her to do something, so she\u2019s in the room.\u201dKillian had attended the dinner with Albert\u2019s servant at Adam\u2019s dissuasion, who did not want Julietta\u2019s appearance to be talked about. He had been in a bad mood. Moreover, his nerves grew sharper due to Lady Anais, who looked at him and struggled to talk to him more.The actions of the woman became bolder as she saw him covering up his irritation and responding as gently as possible, while the blood vessels on Killian\u2019s forehead began to stand out so clearly as to be visible.As Oswald felt increasingly anxious as the atmosphere seemed to be crossing the line of danger, he noticed the slight touch of the hand of Lady Anais on Killian\u2019s, as if it were a coincidence. When it was repeated a few times, Killian finally burst into a rage.\u201cThis\u2026\u201d\u201cYour Highness! I had a quick report to give you, but I forgot. We\u2019re almost finished with the meal, so I\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019d like you to spare me a moment.\u201dOswald quickly interrupted Killian\u2019s anger, which was about to burst out. As everyone\u2019s eyes turned to them at his cry for asking, Christine\u2019s hand, which had been encouraged by other kindnesses before, and which was trying to approach Killian a little more intimately, retreated sharply.Killian barely calmed down at Oswald\u2019s desperate gaze at him.\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll leave here now, so enjoy your meal. Adam, Valerian, Oswald, follow me to the Oval Office.\u201dWhen the Prince got up, everyone in the dining room also stood and saw him off. Christine, looking anxiously at the back of Killian, who went out without looking back, felt sorry without even knowing that she would have been disgraced in public.It was worthwhile to come all the way to Bertino with her hard work. At the appearance of Killian, who was different from his cold and indifferent attitude in Austern, she lightly smiled in excitement and hope, and decided that she would act a bit more aggressive.Julietta cleaned up the mess in the bathroom and prepared a bed for the Prince as he set off for the dinner, and then left the bedroom for dinner.Julietta\u2019s steps were very quick, not knowing the evening time, as she had been driven out of the room without meeting Sir Albert at the Baroness\u2019s command. If she couldn\u2019t eat on time again this time, she would have to skip eating until tomorrow morning, and she was in a hurry because of that. She ran down the stairs leading to the first floor and quickly headed for the maid\u2019s quarters.As she hurried past the dark path, she heard a sudden call for her.\u201cThere, hold on. Would you like to see me for a while?\u201dJulietta looked back with a grimace at the thought of the Baroness she had encountered around this spot during the day, and she saw a pretty woman standing there.\u201cDid you call me?\u201dThe woman in front of Julietta, who was waiting for her to make a fuss about her appearance, spoke indifferently, \u201cYou must be a new maid for His Highness, right? Are you going to eat?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d Julietta answered quickly and tried to get on her way because she thought she would be late for dinner.\u201cYou can only eat at a fixed time in the dining room in the dorm. If you don\u2019t make it that time, you should go to the maids\u2019 dining room in the main castle. It\u2019s a leftover from the nobles and knights, so it may be short of the amount and not have many varieties.\u201dJulieta was deeply moved by the woman in front of her, who spoke to her kindly, not laughing or surprised at her.\u201cThank you. By the way, where is that dining room of the main castle? I can\u2019t guess because it\u2019s too big. Can you tell me which direction it is?\u201dJulietta\u2019s polite question made the woman in front of her smile.\u201cI was just on my way to dinner. Follow me.\u201dJulietta didn\u2019t think she was a maid, because she wasn\u2019t wearing a uniform, but she seemed to be ranked as high as the Baroness and her followers. While she was thinking about what to call such a complicated system of positions, unlike Harrods Street\u2019s, the woman took the lead after signaling Julietta to follow her.\u201cHuh? I just passed the entrance?\u201dThe woman turned slightly at Julietta\u2019s question.\u201cThe door used by the maids is over there. The dining room is closer to that side.\u201dJulietta nodded at the gentle remarks. She had vowed to act prudently in accordance with her position, but went back out through the main gate without any concern. She grumbled, Anyway, I am still not used to this society with a class system, and thought she\u2019d have to be more careful if she wanted to live a thin, long life. Suddenly there was someone blocking them.\u201cOh, my God, who is this? Isn\u2019t it Sylvia?\u201dA figure with a dark dress and a hood appeared, pretending to know the woman leading the way, and abruptly slapped her in the face. Julietta was looking at them, as she wanted to know what this was about, and this time the newcomer grabbed the head of the woman named Sylvia and began to beat her wildly, shaking her head without mercy.While frightened Julietta jumped in and stopped her, the fallen woman screamed with an ear-splitting sound. The knights on guard ran to the commotion. As the clatter of armor drew near, the mysterious figure suddenly ran away.The knights arrived as Julietta smoothed down her shirt and lifted up the woman who had collapsed and was unable to move. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201dAt an important time when dinner was being held to celebrate the return of the monarch and VIPs visited, this commotion happened, so a bitter interrogation came down at the uproar.\u201cSuddenly, a woman appeared and hit her severely.\u201d Julietta pointed to the side where the figure with a hood ran away, and tried to explain.Suddenly the woman who fell down raised herself and said to the knights, crying bitterly, \u201cNo, she\u2019s lying.This maid hit me. She asked me where the dining room of the maids was, and I was in the middle of guiding her, but she suddenly pushed me and started beating me severely.\u201dSurprised by the woman in front of her, Julietta cried out in dismay. \u201cWhat are you talking about? Why are you lying? I didn\u2019t do that, did I?\u201d\u2018Was she beaten on the head?\u2019She shook the woman\u2019s shoulders as if she were going to wake up, and a tough hand held her back.\u201cAre you sure you were hit by this maid?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s right. I was on my way to guide her to the dining room, as I heard she was a new maid of His Highness. As soon as I passed the entrance door of the main castle, she asked me why I was dragging her to the wrong place, and she suddenly started hitting me. It\u2019s a crime against a noble since she hit me, the daughter of Viscount Chaister! Please punish her severely.\u201dJulietta could not believe what had happened in a flash.\u201cTake her.\u201dShe was taken to the prison in the basement for allegedly swinging her fist at the noblewoman with no excuse. Julietta, trapped in her cell, was devastated, and sat down on the floor.She had assumed the other was a high-ranking woman, but didn\u2019t know that she was a daughter of the family of the Viscount. She couldn\u2019t understand why that kind woman, who had showed her the way, had suddenly changed and put the blame on her like that.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Calen Castle, Part IXTranslator: KhanEditor: AelryinthWhy did the daughter of the family of the Viscount entrap me less than a day after I arrived at Calen Castle? I didn\u2019t steal her rice bowl.She didn\u2019t understand who, why, and for what purpose they went so far as to entrap such a worthless maid like her.\u2018Oh, was she assigned to be the maid of His Highness, instead of me?\u2019Julietta nodded unconsciously, recalling Anna, who had kicked Nicole out of Harrods Street with a lie.\u2018I see, she did. Then she could talk to Sir Albert, but why did she do that? I quickly wanted to go back to Harrods Street. Ah, I\u2019m hungry. Why do I have to go through something like this, like I committed a great sin in a previous life? You son of a bitch, a damn dog!\u2019Her stomach, which had been empty since lunch, suddenly made a loud sound that she was choked with sorrow. However, she could not escape from this gloomy reality by crying. Unless a witness showed up, she did not know what punishment she would have for harming a noblewoman. Frustrated, Julietta began to worry.\u2018Would it be better if I tell them I am an illegitimate child of the Marquis? I decided to live like a stranger I never knew, but now that something dangerous has happened, what I can lean on is only that half with the aristocratic blood. But would he hear me if I would ask for help, especially when he came here with his beloved daughter?\u2019She leaned against the cold prison wall in a gloomy mood, thinking of asking for help as a last resort from the Marquis who had also come to Calen Castle. She thought that it was too hard for a commoner to live in this system of social status, who had nothing and no background.While Julietta was frustrated, the beaten woman Sylvia met Baroness Lanolf.\u201cYes, you did well. As soon as she\u2019s done, I\u2019ll look into the opportunity and push you into the role of the maid of His Highness.\u201dSylvia smiled in delight at Pamela\u2019s promise.It had been six months since she had been chosen by Baroness Lanolf, who had close ties to her mother, to enter Calen Castle. The only purpose that the daughter of a wealthy and the wantless family of the Viscount had applied as a maid, not a high job in the noble society. It was to be closer to him, the noble Grand Duke of Bertino and Prince of Austern.Pamela, who was aware of Sylvia\u2019s inner feelings, set a condition on her a few hours ago. If she would help her plan, she would give her the position as a maid of the Prince. The Baroness said, \u201cIf Jeff is absent due to an accident and even the girl is kicked out, it will be difficult for Sir Albert to get a maid or servant with a certain status immediately, so I will recommend you.\u201dThe family of Viscount Chaister was one of the knights who had stood by the Prince\u2019s maternal ancestor, the first Marquis Bertino, when he had made a brilliant showing in the great war of four hundred years ago. Due to her family, Prince Killian would believe and accept her as his maid.Sylvia, who wanted the private maid seat that would follow him to Austern, not a maid who had to look at him from far away every time he visited Calen Castle, agreed with Pamela, who wanted to plant her right-hand girl by the Prince, and so Julietta was falsely accused.Pamela had a smile of satisfaction after looking at Sylvia. Even if she could not kick out Sir Albert, who nitpicked on her for no reason in all cases, with this much blame, she thought she might be able to decrease the faith of His Highness in him more and more by taking this opportunity. If Sylvia was in the eyes of the Prince, or even if not, she might have a chance to advance the retirement of old Albert if she won his trust as an individual maid.Pamela waited for this to reach the Prince\u2019s ear, and calculated when it would be most effective for her to visit the Prince.\u201cYour Highness, you\u2019ve been well to be patient. I was very glad that you remembered my advice. Prince Francis is expected to arrive in a few days. I ask you to give me a favor, lest Lady Anais give Prince Francis any room.\u201dKillian spoke cynically to Adam, who nagged as soon as he finished the dinner and moved to the Oval Office. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing that even the Count seems to be in a good mood.\u201d\u201cYour Highness, if you want to make me feel better, you can get engaged to Lady Anais and climb on the seat of the Crown Prince at this time.\u201dDespite Killian\u2019s sarcastic remarks, Oswald stepped in to soften the mood as Adam was still smiling, \u201cWell, now, I\u2019d like to finish talking about earlier this afternoon. You\u2019re saying we should get rid of the front wall of the new jewelry store and make it glass, right?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. The stores are in the capitals of each country. First, we\u2019ll set up one at Austern and Vicern, here at Ricaren, and then we\u2019ll watch the sales trend and open the rest.\u201d\u201cIf we\u2019re going to recruit workmen, find out the sites, and set up the buildings, we can\u2019t open them until next year.\u201d\u201cAs soon as the hunting competition is over next week, split up and find the sites first. Valerian, stay here and find out, Oswald in Vicern, and Adam in Austern.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s going to be hard to spend the summer in Bertino; there are so many things to do this year,\u201d Adam said to the Prince.\u201cBut I\u2019m really glad we\u2019ll be able to make it easy when the Magic Square is restored in a couple of months.\u201dAt Valerian\u2019s words, Oswald agreed enthusiastically, \u201cThat\u2019s a relief! This Oswald, who should be leading the Austern\u2019s trends, was supposed to be in Bertino for half a year; so that\u2019s what the costumes of the Imperial Castle look like. Do you know how surprised I was when I went to His Majesty\u2019s birthday banquet this spring? They were still hanging those ridiculous heavy wrinkle decorations that were popular last spring. Even the prim people in Vicern won\u2019t keep that loyalty to one fashion.\u201cYes, I\u2019m very happy to hear that. I don\u2019t have to suffer any more from the Marquis, who thinks he\u2019s bored every day.\u201d He nodded as if he were really lucky to see Oswald tearing down ribbon-shaped cravats in a fit of excitement. Adam was smiling, accepting Valerian\u2019s words, and suddenly Albert came in with an urgent knock.\u201cYour, Your Highness.\u201d Albert opened the door and came in, bewildered as to how to report on what had been reported by a knight.The maid, who he seemed to like, was suddenly taken to the underground prison, and his heart was trembling at the mere thought of the Prince\u2019s anger. He was even more embarrassed because she did not put on airs like Jeff, and despite her ugly appearance, was not frivolous or condescending in her belief in her status as a maid of the Prince, unlike the charges stipulated.While Albert hesitated and was at a loss for what to do, he was completely unaware of the plot that had entangled a girl who was only a maid, and Killian urged him, \u201cWhat the hell is going on? Has Prince Francis arrived already?\u201d\u201cNo, Your Highness. Julietta is in the underground prison right now, accused of assaulting an aristocrat.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d Killian frowned at Albert\u2019s words. \u201cJulietta is not such a maid to hit a woman. Moreover, did she hit a noblewoman? What nonsense is that?\u201dAt the silver eyes darkened with evidence of discomfort, Albert raised his hands as if to calm him down and quickly relayed the rest of the report.\u201cThis is what\u2026 The beaten woman is Sylvia Chaister, the second daughter of Viscount Chaister. The maid testified that Julietta assaulted her. Others were not there, and the person who was hit pointed at Julietta right away, and she was taken to the underground prison, where she was confined.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Calen Castle, Part XTranslator: KhanEditor: AelryinthKillian\u2019s eyes glowed fiercely at the words \u201cunderground prison\u201d.\u201cWho dares to put my maid in jail? Maybe it\u2019s a challenge to me. Take the lead. I\u2019ll go and get Julietta right away.\u201dAfter ordering that in a dismal voice, Killian strode across the office to a sword hanging on the wall, and Adam hurriedly blocked him.\u201cNo, Your Highness.\u201d\u201cGet out of my way, I will decide whether to do it or not.\u201dThere was such terrible energy that he wanted to sit down into his seat, but Adam held on in front of Killian, even shaking him. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re going down to the underground prison for just a maid. It\u2019s not possible.\u201d\u201cJust a maid? Is it just a maid who takes care of me and is closest to me? Then Adam, you\u2019re also just a subordinate to me. I can\u2019t believe just a Count would stand in my way. Do you want to die?\u201dKillian took out the sword he was holding, and held it around his neck, but Adam did not move at all and appealed again.\u201cIf you really think so, please kill me here and go on the way you were going to. It\u2019s nothing but a commoner\u2019s assault on a noble woman. No matter who you are, you cannot take the commoner out of prison without any punishment, after they committed a crime against a noble. What\u2019s more, you\u2019re carrying a sword. All the nobles will protest, saying that she has disrupted the order of ranks. In this situation, Your Highness, who is of the royal family, can\u2019t do what you want. Now is the time to find out what happened. As you may have guessed, there must be some sort of conspiracy, to have your maid arrested for assault.\u201dAs if he really wanted to wield the sword to Adam, who kept up his calm until the end, Killian held his sword closer and whispered in his ear. \u201cDo you really want me to kill you? Huh? Do you want me to do that way?\u201d\u201cYou clearly said you didn\u2019t have any other feelings for the maid. But you\u2019re really going to kill me, your most loyal servant friend, because of that maid?\u201d Adam responded to Killian in a low voice, without an inch of retreat.At the tense confrontation between the two, Albert was uncomfortable and said, only \u201cYour Highness,\u201d and Oswald and Valerian looked at them with tense expressions.After a long standoff with a sword in Adam\u2019s throat, Killian finally lowered his arm as he stared at him. Then Adam bowed his head and fell to his knees. Killian, looking coldly down at his aide, who bowed with his neck out as if he wanted nothing but order, finally handed Albert the sword he was holding.When Albert, whose heart had fallen to the bottom for the first time at the sight, managed to take the sword into his trembling hands, Killian stood still and closed his eyes and began breathing deeply. Nobody else dared breathe out loud.After a while, Killian\u2019s eyes, which had reopened after a long time, had returned to his usual cold-lit silver color.\u201cGet up.\u201dKillian gave a hard command to Adam, who was still kneeling, and returned to the top of the conference table and sat down.\u201cThe Count, you\u2019re not totally forgiven. You should never use the word \u2018just\u2019 to anyone around me again. But I admit you\u2019re right. It\u2019s more likely to be a conspiracy against me or for another gain. Valerian, check around the girl who was beaten. Find out that by whom she has been referred to as a maid, and who\u2019s been in contact with her from the family of Chaister lately.\u201dKillian turned on Albert as Valerian stepped out of the office after hurriedly bowing.\u201cAlbert, why would Julietta be so accused? I don\u2019t think the two of them know each other, but where did the contact occur?\u201d\u201cAs soon as I got the report, I went to the jail and asked about it. She said that Lady Chaister was taking her to the dining room in the main castle. While she was following, suddenly a woman with a black hood appeared, beat Lady Chaister severely, and ran away. As she was trying to help the fallen Lady rise up, knights came running up when they heard her screams, but she suddenly cried and said Julietta had hit her.\u201d\u201cThe dining room? Didn\u2019t you show Julietta the dining room? So, so far, Julietta hasn\u2019t had a meal?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s\u2026 I\u2019ve told her, but\u2026\u201dWhen Killian got angry again, Albert opened his mouth to make excuses but shut it up again. He didn\u2019t even have a word to say when he thought it had come to this, because he had given a rough account of the maids\u2019 meals. He might be forced to retire today if she was not released safely.\u201cSend a meal to the basement first. Take care that the food is not bad.\u201dKillian looked back at Oswald as Albert\u2019s servant, who had been waiting after dinner to serve the Prince, hurried out to follow the order.\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be hard to just get her out?\u201d\u201cYes, Your Highness. Count Adam is right. Your Highness can\u2019t do anything about it, because it\u2019s nothing other than a commoner who has harmed a noble. As the attacker of the assault, she can\u2019t help but wait for the punishment Lady Chaister will determine. She\u2019s already in the underground prison, so it\u2019s hard to ask for her as if nothing has happened, or for her to re-testify that she was mistaken, since we don\u2019t know what she\u2019s thinking. If she\u2019s ever been abetted by Prince Francis or another Prince, our attempt to persuade the maid will be a weakness for Your Highness.\u201dOswald looked at Killian for a moment and then carefully opened his mouth again. \u201cEven if Lady Chaister asks you to execute your maid, if you can\u2019t prove her innocence, you have no choice but to proceed. It can disrupt the order of society. They\u2019re all going to react sensitively to this and they will watch.\u201dOswald shook his head sadly and continued on. \u201cIf Your Highness put your power over this, the nobility will blame you. I\u2019m sure the family of Chaister will protest, too. I\u2019m glad if Lady Chaister\u2019s demands are nothing more than lashing or expelling, it is just as well, but I think she\u2019ll ask for a death sentence to get rid of future trouble.\u201dKillian\u2019s face cooled more and more at the words of a death sentence.\u201cWhat about setting up a fake witness?\u201dAdam, who had returned to his seat, opened his mouth at Killian\u2019s words. \u201cIt should be the testimony of someone of higher status than Lady Chaister, or who can say that the testimony of the daughter of the Viscount is false? Those with low status might be a problem later, even if Your Highness won them over to your side. Then, among those who are currently in the castle, the identity of the person who can be a false witness will be narrowed. Among them, only me and Count Oswald and Count Valerian are to be trusted. Sadly, however, we can\u2019t give false testimony that we saw the scene, because we came to the Oval Office with you from the dinner table.\u201dBoom! Killian\u2019s angry fist hit the table.\u2018Who the hell is behind this scene?She was not such a careless maid to act so recklessly to a noblewoman who she did not know, even if she was sometimes impudent and grumbled. That was why he had trusted her.For others, even if it was Albert\u2019s servant, Julietta was as polite as possible. Not long ago, she had intervened in the conversation between him and the Count in the carriage, and she had been puzzled all day and studied his face to see if he was angry.She could not beat anyone who she did not know in the strange place that she had just arrived today.It was clear that as Julietta had said, that Lady Chaister was lying.\u2018What is she aiming for? By whom has she been abetted, and would she dare to do such a great thing?\u2019\u201cFirst check to see if anyone saw the scene or if anyone was nearby. And Adam, find out where Duke Martin is. It\u2019s likely to be nearby since he started returning similar to me, and we\u2019re a little back after stopping by Beopash. I want you to search every street that comes to Ricaren and bring him into the castle without anyone knowing as soon as you find the Duke.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Calen Castle, Part XITranslator: KhanEditor: AelryinthWhen Adam stood up with a nod, Oswald helped.\u201cFor some reason, I\u2019ll have to visit the old man Calf by the time the Duke arrives. The old man will love it if I tell him about the new jewelry business the Bertino Business Group will start. After meeting him, I\u2019ll stop by Manol for lunch.\u201dAdam nodded intelligently when he mentioned the most famous restaurant in Ricaren.\u201cAlbert, prepare Duke Martin\u2019s room next to Count Adam\u2019s. That\u2019s where Martin, who arrived early this evening, has been resting because he did not feel well. Talk to the servants and maids not to walk over there so that they don\u2019t go to the place where the Duke takes a rest. And Count Adam never got out of the castle today. Do you understand? From this point on, no one is allowed in or out of this office. Only Albert and your servant, serve me.\u201dAs soon as Killian finished speaking, Adam rose to his feet, opened a secret passage linked to the bookcase of his office, and disappeared.\u201cWhat if Duke Martin doesn\u2019t arrive on time?\u201dKillian smiled coldly at Oswald\u2019s question. \u201cWhat do you think I\u2019ll do?\u201dOswald had a deep sigh at the cold reaction. \u201cHe\u2019ll have to bring back Duke Martin at all costs.\u201dOswald asked Albert, \u201cSir Albert, make bitter tea for my tongue to be pulled out so that I can\u2019t doze off because of the bitter taste.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to keep your seat.\u201d Killian clicked his tongue as soon as Oswald took a sip of the tea Albert had put in front of him, watching Oswald shiver.\u201cI feel sorry for you, Your Highness. Do you mean you don\u2019t need this, Oswald?\u201dOswald, who pushed his tea to the other side, glared and grabbed his chest, as if he had been greatly betrayed. Killian raised his hand to silence Oswald, who kept trying to say something.\u201cI was deeply impressed by the loyalty of the Marquis. I was worried for nothing. Get the tea you were supposed to drink. You\u2019re my best friend, since you asked for the tea to stay up all night.\u201dOswald\u2019s frowned at Killian\u2019s encouragement. Soon enough, when the tea that had been pushed away was back in front of him, Killian nodded, saying \u201cCome on.\u201d So, Oswald drank a tearful cup of tea and was forced to stay awake all night.Killian, who had been lost in thought until late at night without moving, suddenly rose from his seat.\u201cDon\u2019t stop me.\u201dOswald shrugged at the sudden bluff. \u201cYour Highness, I\u2019m not Adam. Please don\u2019t carry a sword noisily like before, but just go see her, and do not to be seen by others. If you had done that earlier, he wouldn\u2019t have stopped you so desperately.\u201dOswald rose gracefully and opened the window of the Oval Office.\u201cYour, Your Highness, this road isn\u2019t that bad, either. The moon isn\u2019t bright today, so it\u2019s even better. I\u2019ll take care of you very well.\u201dOswald jumped over the window and looked back at Killian.\u201cPlease come, Your Highness. Albert, hand me that tablecloth.\u201dAs Albert moved away the vase in a fluster and peeled off the purple cloth and handed it to him, Oswald threw the cloth over his head and looked back at Killian. Looking at him acting so ridiculous, Killian shook his head once and jumped through the window.When Killian stood next to him, Oswald winked at Albert and said, \u201cI want you to rest for a while until we get back. Your Highness, let\u2019s go.\u201dWatching Oswald, who was leading the way with a light step while dressed in a dark purple tablecloth to hide his colorful blond hair, Killian\u2019s eyes narrowed to see if Oswald was enjoying the situation.\u201cIsn\u2019t a dark night\u2019s walk pretty good without the moon?\u201d Oswald was quick to take a walk without a word, but he suddenly talked about a dark night\u2019s walk. Killian, impatient about Julietta, who was locked in a dark, damp cell, frowned.\u201cNow make a decision. Even if you are the favorite son of His Majesty, and the most likely candidate for the Crown Prince, you\u2019re not yet. Furthermore, you have no desire for an Emperor\u2019s position.\u201d Oswald still spoke lightly, as if he were talking about the surrounding landscape.\u201cWhen the Crown Prince is formally decided, you will be just one of the many Princes. You will be constantly under the check of the next Emperor, who is wary of Your Highness since you have the Principality of Bertino and great wealth. The same thing will happen again and again like today, and you may just have to step aside and see your people removed by slander.\u201dOswald stopped walking and looked around at Killian when he saw the building with the underground prison.\u201cThe target could be Adam, it could be me, or it could be Valerian. Even a young maid in prison doesn\u2019t know what else to get involved in, even if she gets out safely today.\u201dOswald smiled at his Lord, who stood tall on a dark night. \u201cPlease be the Emperor, Your Highness.\u201d*******\u201cOpen the door.\u201dThe knights were stunned by the sight of their monarch appearing late at night. The sinner in prison was said to be his maid, and he must have come here to examine the situation himself. After a knight hurried to open the prison\u2019s iron door and went down ahead, a chief guard who was dozing nearby woke up in surprise.Under the eye of the knight, guards lit up the dark prison with the lamps hanging in the hallway. As he passed along the damp corridor with heavy steps and finally reached the room at the very end, she was visible sitting in a corner with her face buried in her knees.\u201cJulietta.\u201dKillian ordered the guards to open the door hastily and entered the cell. Oswald sent the chief guard, the knight, and the guards far away, then followed them.\u201cJulietta.\u201dJulietta didn\u2019t raise her head despite his call. He shook her shoulders gently, and her brick-colored hair was urgently raised. \u201cYour Highness?\u201d\u201cJulie\u2026\u201dThough she seemed to have fallen asleep crying and had two trace lines of tears on her dark face, Killian only looked at her in a sad way, unable to think it was strange.\u201cYour Highness, are you here to get me out? Did it turn out I did not do that, right? Oh, thank God. I can\u2019t figure out why she lied like that\u2026\u201dJulietta, who had thoroughly believed that Killian had come to the prison to rescue her, rose in a hurry spitting out words full of joy. Killian soothed Julietta in a sad manner, patting her shoulder softly. \u201cNot yet. I couldn\u2019t find anyone who had witnessed the scene. But don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll make sure you get out of here by tomorrow evening.\u201dWhen Albert had come, she had hesitated to ask for help from Marquis Anais. His daughter, who had been an illegitimate child but inherited his blood, had been accused and put in jail. But the only words from the worried Julietta were only \u201cDoes His Highness know?\u201dWhen Albert had said he was going to report to His Highness, Julietta had just waited.There had been hope that she would leave soon after a nice meal that was incomparable to her usual food. But as the night deepened, her hope turned into despair.She had been deeply trusting her employer, who had been quite friendly to her. From somewhere in her heart, hope that he would come to her rescue gradually turned into disappointment in him.Julietta thought she\u2019d ask to see the Marquis as soon as morning came. She also decided that she would stop being such a grumpy maid right away and go back to Austern.If her money was not enough for her debt to Maribel even after receiving her severance pay, she decided to borrow it from the Marquis. If the Marquis said that he had done all he had to do as a father because he saved her, and he couldn\u2019t even lend her money, she would run away.Maybe she could work hard and pay it back, even if it was a little late. She thought she should live for now. She didn\u2019t know what else would be at risk if she kept working under this employer with high status. She felt sorry for losing the high pay, but it was not worth more than her life.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Calen Castle, Part XIITranslator: KhanEditor: AelryinthShe decided so, but she was still worried that the Marquis would not be able to save her. It was her first tears since her mother Stella had died. She thought, \u2018What should I do if my make-up is removed from my eyes?\u2019 But she was also rebellious, \u2018I don\u2019t care, as I might die soon.\u2019 she fell asleep, exhausted, and suddenly her employer woke her up.\u201cYour Highness is the best. Thank you. I didn\u2019t really hit her. Trust me.\u201dKillian unexpectedly embraced Julietta, who relaxed and cried. As he hugged her crying body tightly, he touched the thin frame under the thick cotton cloth.Many times, he patted her back soothingly with a sad heart, and her body in his arms stepped back in surprise, as if realizing something.\u201cYour, Your Highness, I\u2019m sorry. I must have been out of my mind with joy. Please forgive me.\u201dKillian held Julietta quietly and calmed her down as she was apologizing with a bow, patted her tiny head as she lost her spirits and lowered herself. Surprised by the friendly touch, Julietta looked up, raising her thick glasses, and he smiled at the funny appearance.\u2018She is so ugly, but why is she so cute?\u2019Once again, he patted Julietta on the head and heard Oswald calling him from behind.\u201cYour Highness, let\u2019s go. It\u2019s been a while.\u201d His Highness was hugging a maid in a prison. Oswald shook his head in disbelief.\u201cJulietta, hang on a little longer. I\u2019ll get you out of here before tomorrow.\u201d Killian patted her hair one last time and Julietta watched him leave the jail. The cell door was locked again with a rattling sound.She clung to the bars in her anxious state, and saw the back of her employer walking out under the direction of the knight. Looking at his solid back until she could not see it, she trudged back into the corner and sat back against the wall, muttering to herself, \u2018He was mean, but he wasn\u2019t bad either. He\u2019s a good employer, but I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t keep working because the work environment is poor.\u2019She felt she didn\u2019t have to run away as quickly as before, but she was afraid to work in this Calen Castle anymore. This place had put a person in such a trap for no reason was not the right one for her. Julietta decided to hurry up and find another job as soon as the new maid arriving and taking over was finished.\u2014\u2014\u2014-As soon as Christine woke up the next day, she heard the unexpected news from her maid.\u201cWas His Highness\u2019s maid put in jail for beating a noblewoman?\u201d\u201cYes, Miss. She is a private maid His Highness brought from Austern, and she\u2019s a commoner.\u201d\u201cIs she a commoner? Why the hell did he hire such a person? When did that happen?\u201d She asked her maid if that was why he went out in the middle of the dinner.Penny replied, \u201cI think it was time you stayed in the garden for a short walk instead of coming back with the Marquis.\u201dAfter the dinner, Christine had broken up with her father, Marquis Anais, and had taken a walk in a garden linked to the main castle. The reason she couldn\u2019t have returned to the outer castle was that she would have met the Prince again, and she had seen knights running away.She had thought it had nothing to do with herself, so she had gone on carelessly.\u201cHow can she beat a noblewoman, even if she is a private maid of His Highness? How could he have kept such a maid beside him?\u201d Christine said as if dumbfounded, and took a sip of the tea Penny poured.\u201cMiss, I\u2019m afraid His Highness will be in a lot of trouble. It happened on the first day he returned. In particular, she did so to the second daughter of the family of Chaister, who has served the Principality of Bertino since the beginning of the country\u2019s foundation. What the hell happened? Did she act out because she didn\u2019t know what she had to be afraid as she served His Highness? The actions of a maid show the faces of her master, and the Prince must be in such a bad mood.\u201dChristine looked at Penny, who was constantly chatting, as if she were not that kind of maid.\u201cYes. The dignity of His Highness will be damaged if it\u2019s just the fault of a maid. Also, I heard Prince Francis and some high-ranking aristocrats of Austern will visit soon to attend the summer hunting, so how noisy will this be?\u201dChristine, who was still thinking that this could not be happening, said in a dark and damp voice,\u201cWhat a flaw to a man so perfect and beautiful! This should not happen.\u201dChristine seemed to have decided to do something and suddenly rose, while Penny looked in surprise. \u201cMiss?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll see His Highness right now. Tell Count Valerian that I\u2019ll see him.\u201d\u2014\u2014\u201cDo you mean Lady Anais has something to say about what happened yesterday?\u201dKillian was in a good posture without any distractions, even though he sat up all through the night. Valerian replied politely to him, with a feeling the Prince was sharper than yesterday.\u201cYes, Your Highness. I was told that she had something to say about the work of the maid that had happened yesterday.\u201d\u201cIs she a witness?\u201d Oswald was in low spirits and straightened himself up.Judging from the actions of the Prince last night, he seemed to care very much about the imprisoned maid. Of course, he was not sure if it was a matter of affection between a man and a woman, but it was clear that he wasn\u2019t thinking of her as an ordinary maid.Oswald, who valued inner beauty as much as the beauty of the outside, thought there must be a good reason for the Prince\u2019s attention.What was more, the maid\u2019s ugliness wasn\u2019t as offensive as Adam was. He could do nothing with the huge body, but if he would take off her ugly glasses and trim her stiff hair, her looks would not be that bad. His keen eyes, unmatched in regard to beauty, caught Julietta\u2019s straight forehead, narrow jaws, and perfect curved lips.\u2018Oh, if His Highness hadn\u2019t deterred me, I could\u2019ve checked the eyes beyond those thick glasses.\u2019Anyway, with some money and effort, it would be easy to make her look like His Highness\u2019s concubine. His taste would be placed on the cutting board, but no one would dare to make fun of the man who would be emperor right before him.Oswald looked at Valerian with sparkling eyes, making plans.\u201cI don\u2019t think so. She asked me in detail about what had happened yesterday.\u201d Oswald was irritated when Valerian shook his head, as if she were not.\u201cI\u2019m so disturbed. Then, what the hell does she want to talk about, seeing His Highness in the morning?\u201d Oswald, who had been plagued by Christine and Viscountess Morbido until Killian arrived at Calen Castle, was unable to give much credit to Lady Anais. The answer to the question was from Killian.\u201cI\u2019ll know when I see her. Bring her in.\u201dAfter Killian\u2019s permission was given, Valerian ordered the knight outside to bring Lady Anais into the outer castle.After the time for a cup of tea, the knight who had gone to pick up Lady Anais returned.\u201cYour Highness, have you been at peace all night? As soon as I woke up, I heard something surprising, and rushed here.\u201dChristine had tied her chestnut hair finely and wore a sky-blue dress matching her eyes. She bowed deeply to Killian.\u201cWhat about Lady Anais? Did you sleep well? I wonder what made you run to me as soon as you woke up.\u201dChristine, with a slightly pinkish blush on her cheeks despite his casual words, sat down on the sofa under the escort of Valerian.\u201cIt\u2019s about your maid. I was really surprised to hear that in the morning.\u201d She took a deep breath with her hands on her chest as if it were a real jolt, and then spoke again. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing but being put in jail for assaulting an aristocrat. It\u2019s a great loss to your prestige.\u201d\u201cThank you for your concern.\u201d When Killian frowned, as if she was only here to say such a greeting, Christine hurried on.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Calen Castle, Part XIIITranslator: KhanEditor: Aelryinth\u201cI was nearby yesterday.\u201dAs Christine spoke as if she were telling a very big secret, Oswald, who was sitting in a sulky position, flashed his eyes.Unlike Oswald, however, Killian gave a slight nod, telling her to keep talking, without changing his face.After a moment\u2019s embarrassment at his reaction, which was different from what she had expected, she did not feel small, but began to talk firmly about why she had come all this way.\u201cI can testify that your maid never did such a thing.\u201dWhen Christine said that, Oswald looked at Killian without realizing it. Now a fake witness appeared on her own, as if she knew they were secretly trying to make a witness.\u201cDo you mean you witnessed it?\u201dChristine laughed at Oswald\u2019s question.\u201cThe Marquis and His Highness know that it can\u2019t be true, but do you think it\u2019s possible? If I had seen that scene yesterday, I\u2019d have gone out right away.\u201d\u201cSo, are you going to give false testimony about something you haven\u2019t seen? Why?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you know why?\u201dOswald was disturbed when he saw Christine\u2019s shy smile. Pretending not to see him, Christine looked at Killian, who still sat expressionlessly.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing if you get a new maid, but it\u2019s not a good thing if a maid is executed for assaulting a noblewoman. Even more so, it might be troublesome at this important time for His Highness. The behavior of a maid has an effect on the fame of the master. This Christine can\u2019t forgive anything to be the slightest bit of flaw to His Highness.\u201d\u201cSo?\u201dOswald became nervous when the cold, shortened words of the Prince indicated that he was not feeling very well now. Christine, however, did not care.\u201cFor your sake, I will give up the honor of the family of Anais and give false testimony. It\u2019s only from my heart that I care about Your Highness.\u201d\u201cIs it only from your heart that I should be grateful?\u201d\u201cYes, Your Highness. I just want you to think of me before anyone else, who will stand by your side in the future.\u201d Christine smiled broadly and looked at Killian. No one was present who could not grasp the meaning of her laughter.\u201cThank you, Lady Anais. I understand your heart well, so go back.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Your Highness\u2026\u201dOswald got up quickly after she called on Killian, who had shut his eyes condescendingly despite her commendable offer.\u201cThe heart of Lady Anais is so moving. But His Highness is very tired now because he\u2019s been staying up all night doing the work of Calen Castle and the Bertino Business Group. We\u2019ll discuss your proposal later.\u201d Oswald reached out to Christine with a polite, but irresistible manner. He raised Christine, who hesitated but eventually gave her hand, escorted her to the door, and sent out as if ejecting her.When Oswald, who closed the door, unwittingly brushed his hands off, Valerian\u2019s expression turned strange as he held back his laughter. When Killian opened his eyes and stared at them, Oswald returned to his seat in a casual way and sat down.\u201cIt\u2019s not bad if Duke Martin doesn\u2019t arrive in time. Lady Anais\u2019s plan is obvious, but if you\u2019re going to get married anyway, then she isn\u2019t bad.\u201dAt Oswald\u2019s words, Killian closed his eyes again.********Oswald set off in a colorful orange carriage to meet the old dwarf living outside the castle. Pamela saw him off politely, then looked toward the Oval Office where the Prince was, and thought for a moment.Due to the new project, the Prince and his aides had stayed up all night, continuing their secret meetings. She waited in the morning for any word on the punishment of the maid in prison for assaulting a noblewoman, but the door to the Oval Office was still closed after Oswald had left. After only Albert and his servant visited the office and banned other users from entering, Pamela decided that she could not wait continuously.She had heard that the girl was a temporary maid, but the Prince did not seem to pay any attention to her. It was not desirable for the maid to be executed while he was being distracted from the public\u2019s interest. Of course, she could avenge Jeff\u2019s injury, but that was only half the purpose.Pamela herself couldn\u2019t come forward, since she had to be a thorough stranger in this matter. After a moment of thought, she sent a message to the residence of Chaister.Sylvia refused to let the Viscount know the burden she had for lying, but in the present situation, there was no one as suitable as Viscount Chaister himself. If the Viscount visited the Prince and asked for strong punishment for his daughter after being assaulted by a commoner, it would not be buried quietly.******\u201cYour Highness, Viscount Chaister is here for you.\u201dIt had not been long since Marquis Oswald had left Calen Castle. It was too early for the Marquis to return, and whether Adam and Duke Martin would arrive on time was also a question. He thought they\u2019d arrive at least by evening, but he couldn\u2019t delay the matter any longer if Viscount Chaister visited.Killian was lost in thought for quite a long time after Valerian reported darkly, and finally opened his mouth.\u201cBring in Marquis Anais and his daughter, Lady Anais. Let those who are involved in this wait in the hall for, except Julietta. Bring along Viscount Chaister, too.\u201d\u201cYour Highness!\u201dAlbert was distressed that his precious Prince was ready to show his weakness to Lady Anais to save such a humble maid, and exclaimed bitterly, but Killian\u2019s face was expressionless. Albert noticed the dreadful anger on his expressionless face, couldn\u2019t say anything, and hurried to enforce the order.\u2014Viscount Chaister was in quite a bad mood. The Baroness\u2019s letter, which had arrived around the end of lunch, contained an absurd content. As soon as he confirmed the letter, he set off for Calen Castle in a rage.Although he did not ask for a visit in advance, he thought the Prince would understand the matter, as it was a serious issue. Of course, he also thought that this might be an opportunity to get closer to the Prince. The Viscount waited for the call of the Prince with a great deal of steel in his shoulders.He waited for a long time in the waiting room, but contrary to the expectation of a one-on-one meeting with the Prince, he was led straight to the hall without any word.Though he was the Prince of the Austern Empire and King of the Principality of Bertino, he was neglecting the Viscount, so he was even more angry at the affront. He came here for nothing else but to see the Prince after his private maid had assaulted his daughter.Except for the purple velvet chair for the Prince on the podium, the spacious hall was empty. The Viscount had to stand in the hall waiting for the Prince, like the knights and servants and maids, and his face began to turn red with anger.\u2014Moments later, Marquis Anais and Christine arrived at the hall, and then the Prince came in with Count Valerian and Albert.\u201cYour Highness, I haven\u2019t seen you in a long time. How have you been in the meanwhile?\u201dThe Viscount greeted Killian with a red face, as his anger still lingered. However, Killian openly ignored him, responding to the greetings of Marquis Anais and his daughter, who stood to one side.\u201cWelcome, the Marquis and Lady.\u201dChristine comforted herself by watching Killian overpowering everyone. There had been no particular message from the Prince since her visit in the morning, but when she saw this call, she thought he had accepted her offer. The future that she had dreamed of was coming before, and the corners of her mouth turned up at the edges. She suppressed it and waited for the time to act quickly.\u201cBring Sylvia Chaister.\u201d A cold voice echoed through the hall. Christine frowned slightly when she saw Sylvia on standby being called out in front of the podium.She felt sorry for the daughter of the Viscount, who had been beaten by a cheeky maid and would suffer a great deal from her testimony. But she decided to think it was her fate, just as Christine\u2019s own destiny was gaining an edge over other competitors by taking the opportunity to come to Bertino.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Calen Castle, Part XIVTranslator: KhanEditor: AelryinthWhile she was engrossed in sweet fantasies about her future, Killian proceeded with the questioning. \u201cWas it just that you showed her the way with kindness, and she suddenly hit you for no reason?\u201dAt Killian\u2019s low-pitched tone, Sylvia nodded and glanced toward Viscount Chaister. It seemed that Baroness Lanolf had finally contacted him.She was more nervous and trembling with the burden, but it had already happened. Sylvia, now unable to retreat, calmed her heart and answered with a sad face, squeezing her tears out as she had practiced numerous times. \u201cYes, Your Highness. I just did a little kindness\u2026\u201dKillian stared at the woman crying and ordered Albert, \u201cAlbert, repeat what you have heard from my maid.\u201d\u201cYour Highness, why is not here a scandalous bitch that should be killed and my daughter, the victim, is being questioned like a sinner? You can\u2019t do this!\u201d Viscount Chaister, who had been displeased at being ignored earlier, protested, unable to contain himself when only his daughter was being called out for questioning.Killian\u2019s heartless gaze remained unchanged despite the angry cry that filled the hall. Anyways, today the family of Chaister would disappear from the Lenaid continent. He had no intention of bringing Julietta in and making a spectacle of her.\u201cAlbert, tell me what you\u2019ve heard.\u201dThe people who gathered in the hall began to be stirred up as Killian continued to treat the Viscount as not existing since a while ago.Pamela\u2019s face hardened as she watched the situation develop. The arrogant and cold-hearted Prince had drawn a distinct line between public and private matters. Even if he considered the maid innocent and Sylvia reprehensible, after being caught up in this, the Prince, who should comfort Sylvia, the victim, did not show any sign of it, even though everyone was watching; it was so suspicious. As soon as she had got married, she had lost her husband, come to Calen Castle, and worked as a maid for a long time. A sense that she had earned over time was sending her a warning.Celine, the girl who had hit Sylvia, had said that she had not been caught by anyone, but the Prince\u2019s attitude made it clear that things were wrong.Pamela gently turned her ring towards the palm of her hand. She had put it on her finger to prepare for a possible situation. The ring was designed to raise a needle that had been hidden inside the ring when the small ruby was twisted around the setting. With a tight grip on the ruby in the palm of her hand, Pamela moved forward gently through the gathered people.\u201cI see. My maid had an argument with Lady Chaister.\u201cWhat she said, that a woman in a black dress suddenly appeared and hit me is a lie. There can be no such person in this castle with a tightened guard. If there were such a suspicious person, why didn\u2019t the knights find the person yesterday when they were searching for her?\u201dSylvia refuted Albert\u2019s words in a trembling voice. She even thought it was a real relief that the maid was not here. It would be really hard for her to lie while facing the maid she had entrapped.\u201cIt seemed that she was very proud to be a personal maid of Your Highness. Although she was born a commoner, she seemed to think that she was different from ordinary maids, and she said that she could go through the main gate, and she got angry with me. However, it was not a problem and I advised her to stay away from the main gate as long as she could, unless she was busy. At my words, she suddenly started hitting me, saying that she was different from ordinary maids, and I was arrogant to teach her.\u201dAs Sylvia showed her slightly bruised, bluish left face to Killian, and cried, a grotesque sigh of \u2018Oh, my god\u2019 was in the mouths of those who saw her.Sylvia raised her head to see the Prince\u2019s reaction, boosted by the people\u2019s reaction. After he had seen her bruised face, she thought the casual look might have changed. But Sylvia faltered back, because his expression looking straight at her was full of contempt.Sylvia\u2019s legs began to tremble at the expression, which clearly showed that he did not believe what she had said.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013Oswald stopped by the most famous restaurant in Ricaren, Manol, after talking about the jewelry business with the old dwarf.As the Marquis, dressed in a vivid blue jacket and a golden vest that matched the orange carriage, stepped out in front of the restaurant, his eyes were drawn to the spectacular view. As he entered the restaurant gracefully, enjoying the eyes of the people, the driver of the family of Oswald moved to the coach house.Normally, he would have stopped the carriage in the coach house and gone to a nearby snack bar and spent some time in moderation, but today was different. The driver pulled over the carriage at the innermost area and opened wide both doors of the carriages.While the driver was busy coming and going for a while, a luxurious dark blue carriage came in.The new carriage stopped next to the Marquis\u2019s, which was definitely visible even inside the coach house. Soon the dark blue-uniformed driver leapt from the horseback seat, opened the carriage doors wide and began cleaning like the driver of the orange carriage.A team of security guards at the coach house glanced at the drivers, who were diligently cleaning the insides of the wagon from far away, and pulled out the lunch boxes they had prepared. They thought they\u2019d be busy all day today, seeing the crowds of guests coming in earlier than usual, and they had to finish their meals before they were too busy. They picked up their forks.The driver of the blue carriage, when he saw the guards were engrossed in their meals, grabbed the hand of the prone Duke Martin and raised him up.\u201cIt\u2019s my first time laying on the floor of a carriage in more than fifty years.\u201d The grumbling Duke of Martin, hiding himself behind the doors of the wide-open carriage, safely moved to the next carriage. As the Duke lay on the floor again out of sight from the outside, Adam, dressed as a driver, whispered, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Father, but you have to stay under the seat.\u201dAn exasperated groan came out of Duke Martin\u2019s mouth.\u201cI\u2019ll go in before I get to the castle. I don\u2019t know when the Marquis might come, but if I am already in there, I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ll come out alive, because my legs are asleep.\u201d\u201cWhen the carriage leaves, go in. There\u2019s nothing wrong with being careful.\u201dAt his ending words, Adam heartlessly closed the doors of the carriage, and ordered the driver of the family of Marquis Oswald, \u201cBefore you start, you\u2019ll help him hide himself.\u201d\u201cYes, my Count.\u201dAfter nodding at the driver\u2019s answer, Adam climbed onto the horseback seat of the carriage he had driven and pretended to fall asleep with his hat deeply pressed down.\u2014\u2014At that time, Oswald the wagon provider was having a good time of his own, with his mouth-pleasing works of art.\u201cOh my God, who is this? Marquis Oswald! I can\u2019t believe we\u2019re meeting here.\u201dDuke Kiellini was very pleased to find Oswald dining on the terrace of Manol, a restaurant with a fountain in the square of Ricaren.\u201cYour Excellency, it\u2019s been a long time. I was surprised to hear that you would visit Bertino. When I saw you in the spring, you didn\u2019t say that.\u201dAfter Oswald, an austere aristocrat and closest aide to the Prince, appeared at the restaurant, the attention of a handful of guests and restaurant staff soon turned to him. When a silver-haired gentleman appeared, who seemed to be higher ranked than him, people became more excited and focused on them so as not to miss a word.\u201cDuke Martin praised Bertino\u2019s summer as beautiful so much. I followed him when he came to visit Bertino. In addition, I\u2019ve had my own business. Has Duke Martin arrived?\u201d\u201cYes, Your Excellency. He arrived around yesterday evening. His trip must have been quite difficult. As soon as he came, he couldn\u2019t even attend the dinner, and he took a break right away. But I\u2019m glad to hear that the Magic Square will be restored by the end of the year.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Calen Castle, Part XVTranslator: KhanEditor: Aelryinth\u201cBut on the way, I heard that other visitors had arrived before us.\u201d Duke Kiellini mentioned the unexpected visit by Marquis Anais.\u201cYes, sir. I hope you don\u2019t feel uncomfortable.\u201d\u201cI have nothing uncomfortable. I guess it\u2019s a little awkward, because we\u2019ve rarely come and gone\u2026 Oh, I interrupted you. Keep your dinner.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m done. It looks like Manol\u2019s fame is in your ears, too. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re visiting on purpose like this.\u201d\u201cYes. As soon as I arrived in Ricaren, I planned to stop here first.\u201dAs Duke Kiellini said goodbye to him with the words \u2018Let\u2019s meet in the castle later\u2019, and entered the inside under the guidance of a staff member who was waiting. Oswald politely saw off the man from behind, and called in the manager for his bill.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014When Oswald\u2019s fancy carriage arrived at the gate, the captain of the guard approached for an inspection and greeted him.\u201dAre you back?\u201d\u201cYou are doing a good job. Don\u2019t make a mistake, and be in attendance on him politely when Duke Kiellini arrives.\u201d\u201cYes, sir.\u201dThe carriage entered the castle after being seen off by the captain of the guard, ran for a long time, and passed through the inner gate.Oswald lifted the seat opposite him and assisted Duke Martin lying within. As the Duke swore and managed to pull himself out of the storage compartment under the velvet-covered seat, Oswald\u2019s servant took off his jacket, carefully put it on the chair and entered the place where Martin had been lying.\u201cYour Excellency, we\u2019re about to arrive. Thank you for your hard work.\u201d\u201cThis is more than I thought. I don\u2019t know what this is all about all of a sudden. What kind of a man did this against His Highness?\u201dOswald laughed as Duke Martin grumbled. \u201cBut I\u2019m glad you were on your way to Bertino. Take off your jacket and change into this one. I think it\u2019ll be a little bit small, because it\u2019s my servant\u2019s clothes.\u201dThe Duke of Martin, who had just been given the gray uniform which the servant had taken off, took off his coat and switched them.\u201cWhen we get to the main castle, I\u2019ll get off and the driver will drop you off at the private entrance for the servants. Albert\u2019s servant will be waiting there, so follow him. Unfortunately, since you arrived earlier than your luggage, I thought I\u2019d lend you my clothes.\u201dOswald burst into laughter as the Duke shook his head in fright at the final words.\u201cI can\u2019t help you since you were so hasty. It\u2019s crumpled, but you\u2019ll have to wear the same clothes you wore. I want you to come down to the hall as soon as the servant fixes the clothes.\u201dThe Duke nodded to Oswald, who spoke with such seriousness compared to when he had laughed. The carriage arrived in the main castle while the two men talked about what might be going on when they came down the hall.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to get off. I\u2019ll get off by myself, so just drive your wagon to the back door.\u201dOswald got out of the carriage and deliberately ordered inside. When the Duke, who pretended to follow him like his servant, sat down again, the carriage started again, as instructed.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013Killian decided he couldn\u2019t take more time.If Duke Martin did not arrive on time and failed to testify, he had to accept the false testimony of Lady Anais. It was clear how Lady Anais would act after taking today\u2019s opportunity, but he was able to bear it to save Julietta.Before Lady Anais had proposed a false testimony, he had also been mindful of sneaking Julietta out of prison. The deal with Lady Anais was nothing compared to risking everything, no matter what would happen afterwards. But no matter how much he tried to reassure himself, he couldn\u2019t stand being angry at the situation.Killian glared at the woman holding her bruised cheek in front of him.\u2018Whose plan is this? What\u2019s the benefit of this, harming my own maid?\u2019He kept thinking about the idea that had been constantly hovering over his head since yesterday: \u201cI will not kill this criminal nicely.\u201d Even Lady Anais tried to take advantage of the opportunity, but he had no intention of forgiving her, either.It was a moment when Killian, finally determined, tried to turn his eyes to Christine, who looked at him with an expectant look. The door of the hall opened after breaking the silence.Oswald, wearing yellow and blue clothes, protested with a loud voice after he entered, \u201cOh no! Your Highness, you promised to wait until I get back.\u201dCount Valerian stared at the Viscount and said disapprovingly, \u201cIt was forced to start quickly because Viscount Chaister visited His Highness without his permission.\u201d\u201cThe Viscount, did you come in here without waiting for the judgment of His Highness to protest about what happened to your daughter?\u201dAs Marquis Oswald abandoned his soft-spoken attitude so far and lashed out harshly, Viscount Chaister exploded in pent-up anger.\u201cIt\u2019s too much, is it? My daughter was beaten severely by the maid of His Highness. This was even by a commoner! But how can I stay calm as a father? Is it so wrong that I came here to ask His Highness to kill the maid? I was afraid that he might forgive her, just because she was his maid.\u201d\u201cThe Viscount, I think you\u2019re thinking something wrong. Do you think His Highness should take responsibility for this, or he would forgive her just because she\u2019s his maid? You are also a subject of His Highness. In the eyes of His Highness, all of them are all the same subjects under him. Then, do you think he would reward you for what his maid has done, or take responsibility for what she\u2019s done?\u201dOswald shook his head as he were stunned. Killian raised his hand to stop him when the Viscount opened his mouth, as if he were protesting.\u201cNo! I\u2019ll question you later on about your own saucy idea. Although the two\u2019s claims are so tense, I will proceed with the punishment of the maid as requested by the family of Chaister, determined to be more credible after Lady Chaister\u2019s claims, according to the reports from the knights that were there yesterday.\u201dSylvia\u2019s face lit up at Killian\u2019s sentence. As her anxiety gradually stabilized, she could raise her head proudly and look at Killian for the first time. She was thrilled to be able to serve this dazzling man closer now.Meanwhile, Christine was embarrassed by Killian\u2019s answer. When he had called her here, she had thought he was definitely trying to go ahead with what she had said in the morning. As she tried to come forward, thinking she couldn\u2019t just pass this chance, the door to the hall opened once again.\u201cYour Highness, I\u2019ve been lying down all day because I wasn\u2019t feeling well, so I\u2019ve only heard that the verdict is being held in the hall about the case of what happened last night.\u201dAt the resonant deep voice, Killian looked at the door and shouted with pleasure, \u201cDuke Martin, are you all right? I\u2019ve been worried about you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m okay, thanks for your concern. I guess I was a little tired from the long trip. I\u2019ve had a good rest, and now I\u2019m good.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a blessing, but you\u2019re not taking any more rest to get here on purpose. Do you have anything to say?\u201dStanding in front of Killian across the hall, Duke Martin bowed politely. \u201cYes, Your Highness. I came down to see you, but they said you were here because of the verdict about what happened yesterday. The sentence was so strange that I asked about it and I found that it was just what I had witnessed. I went to bed thinking it wouldn\u2019t be a problem for the knights to come running, but things went strange.\u201dDuke Martin remarked about the story of yesterday\u2019s situation he had heard from Adam.\u201cWhat was strange?\u201dWhen Killian asked back, Duke Martin glanced back at Sylvia. \u201cI saw the incident yesterday beside the second-floor window before I went to sleep. What I saw was a black-hooded person hit the thinner of the two people they encountered, and then run away.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I\u2019m just here to fix it, because I heard a different story from the scene I had witnessed.\u201dKillian stared at Sylvia fiercely and asked Duke Martin, \u201cAre you sure that the daughter of Viscount Chaister was beaten by someone other than a maid?\u201d\u201cYes, Your Highness. I saw it clearly. The person was wearing a hood, but it was a woman with a dress. So, I thought it was just a quarrel between the maids.\u201dAs the Duke\u2019s confirmation began to create murmurs inside the hall, Killian raised his hand to calm the crowd who talked noisily. \u201cLady Chaister, your words and the testimony of the Duke are quite different. What\u2019s the matter? I don\u2019t think that Duke Martin lied to you.\u201d\u201cSilvia, what the hell is going on here? Your Highness, something\u2019s wrong.\u201d Viscount Chaister scolded his daughter, who could not refute the testimony of a powerful figure who suddenly appeared.\u201cStop, it\u2019s noisy. Lady Chaister, tell me the truth about what this is about.\u201dSylvia stood gaping like a fish, speechless. She had to say what she had prepared, just in case, to those who were waiting for her answer, but her mouth wouldn\u2019t move.The Prince had always been unconcerned about the maids, and Sylvia had thought it would be easy to take off a maid from him, but she was suddenly distracted by the chatter around her, the horrifying gaze of the Prince, and the fear of what she had done.She wanted to believe what the Baroness had said: \u201cIf things go wrong, I will take care of you.\u201d But she wondered if it would be possible for her to pull off such a trick against the Duke. If she admitted that the Duke was right here, she was dead!Sylvia wanted to look back at Pamela, who was behind her, but pressed on, \u201cI don\u2019t know what Your Excellency saw, but I thought I was hit by the maid. It was dark and after I said that, suddenly someone hit me in the head. I was hit in the head, so I fell down, and I was assaulted so much that I could not even lift my face. That\u2019s why I thought, of course, the maid with me hit me.\u201dSylvia was quivering and finished speaking.\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you say that when the imprisoned woman complained of injustice, and when Albert told me what the maid had seen? After a witness shows up, you say that it was so dark that you saw it wrong. You wouldn\u2019t have insisted without having a plot in mind. Isn\u2019t that right, Your Highness?\u201dAt Valerian\u2019s question, Killian\u2019s cool gaze turned to the crowd, and then he turned to Viscount Chaister.\u201cI will have to expiscate from now on.\u201dChristine bit her lips as she looked at Killian, who was looking through the people with sharp eyes. She did not expect that Duke Martin had seen it yesterday. She was troubled enough to cry tears of disappointment, but she hoped that her show might have changed his mind a little.Perhaps this could happen again in the future. It made her feel a little better when she thought she of what she could do to create such an opportunity. Christine looked carefully at the black-haired Prince on the high podium and painted in the day she sat next to him.\u201cSilvia Chaister, you testified earlier, as soon as you told her why she should not walk through the front gate, she hit your face in a straight line. And you showed me the bruise on your face. But now you said that you suddenly got hit in the head and you didn\u2019t know who hit you. How are you going to explain this, as your words are inconsistent?\u201dKillian questioned Sylvia gently, contrary to his earlier frightening attitude. However, there was no one who did not notice the warning contained in the friendly tone.Sylvia glanced slightly at her father. Her eyes grew darker with the thought that she was endangering her family. She thought, \u2018If I get out of here safely, my father and the Baroness will do something,\u2019 and looked back because of that.Seeing her father, who seemed to want answers from her, she looked up again at the Prince sitting on the podium. When their eyes met, the silver eyes flashed for a moment and curled finely. Shivering at the moment by a rare smile, Sylvia smiled face-to-face with anticipation. However, she was immediately frustrated by what he said.\u201cIf you tell the truth, I will save your family. I promise. You had better not make my anger worse here.\u201dViscount Chaister himself couldn\u2019t believe what had happened just now. He thought the situation was twisted, and he hoped for an accurate explanation from his daughter\u2019s lips, but the situation was serious. He protested hurriedly, judging that he would be in trouble at this rate at the words of the Prince.\u201cYour Highness, what a terrible thing you mention! There was a misunderstanding because she didn\u2019t see it clearly, but you mention the demise of the family. There was no big incident, and just a commoner was put in jail for a while. It couldn\u2019t have been done on purpose. But you\u2019re persecuting my daughter and my family.\u201d\u201cPersecute\u2026? An innocent woman would have lost her life in my castle, and it\u2019s not a big deal? And it happened just from a misunderstanding? That\u2019s what only you and your daughter would think among the people here. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201dOswald replied quickly to Killian\u2019s words, \u201cYour Highness, it\u2019s even more suspicious at the Viscount\u2019s insistence. No matter who hears it, it must have been designed to trap your maid, but he insists it\u2019s a misunderstanding. I doubt his intentions.\u201cPlease put him in jail for now. Sylvia Chaister\u2019s fault is obvious, so we will have to find out gradually whether the Viscount is behind this, or if there is another one.\u201dSylvia turned blue at Duke Martin\u2019s words.\u2018Jail? No way! I need to talk with the Baroness once I get out of here!\u2019\u2014\u2014Pamela realized that the earlier unrest had become a reality when Duke Martin came alone and talked about what had happened yesterday.When she had discussed this with Sylvia, she had told her to take an air of innocence and get out of the place if something went wrong, no matter what would happen. She had assured her that she would take care of everything after that. So, Sylvia would try to get out of here and meet her.Now that she knew what would happen if she confessed the truth, Sylvia would try to hold out to the end. But it was unclear how long she would last. Pamela muttered as she looked at Sylvia\u2019s back in the middle of the hall.\u201cJust one chance, it will be okay, if I have just one chance\u2026\u201dAs she heard Pamela\u2019s murmur, Sylvia\u2019s body staggered and collapsed helplessly on the spot.\u201cSylvia.\u201dKillian raised his hand to stop Viscount Chaister, who was about to come running when he saw his fallen daughter.\u201cThe Viscount, you and your daughter will be locked up in the castle, banned from contact until the facts are revealed. Take the two of them. Report me as soon as the sinner wakes up.\u201dKillian watched the knights and maids take the Viscount and his daughter, then rose from his seat. Descending from the podium himself, he greeted Duke Martin, and went before Marquis Anais and stopped.\u201cMarquis Anais, I wonder if you know about the offer that your daughter proposed today.\u201dWhen Killian asked, the Marquis looked back at Christine, as if he were wondering.\u201cWell, I guess you didn\u2019t hear it. Then let me just say it briefly. The Marquis, I don\u2019t want the Lady to lie for me, and I don\u2019t want to forgive her for trying to take another chance on the pretext of lying. So, you\u2019ll have to make sure I don\u2019t remind you of this in the future.\u201dAt the word \u201clie,\u201d the Marquis\u2019 face hardened. He looked at Christine, wondering what he was talking about, but she was looking at the Prince, who had come and spoken so aggressively.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Calen Castle, Part XVIITranslator: KhanEditor: AelryinthHe might have felt that look, but Killian left the hall in total disregard of Christine, as if to punish her for trying to control him by her hand for a while.\u201cChristin, what does His Highness mean by what he said?\u201d Despite the angry scolding of the Marquis, Christine was just looked at the door Killian had left through.\u201cChristine!\u201dShe muttered silently without even looking at her father, who was terribly angry, \u201cFather, it\u2019s no big deal. I think I made a little mistake, but I can make up for it very quickly. You don\u2019t have to worry.\u201d\u2014\u2013Meanwhile, Pamela stepped out with dignity as a head maid of Calen Castle and ordered the maids to move the fallen Sylvia to a guest room.Watching Sylvia lie down in the bedroom of guest chambers on the first floor, Pamela approached her, pretending to be worried. Looking down at Sylvia, who felt an indication of a person around and shook her eyelids, Pamela pretending to cover her up with the bedsheet, pressing down on her heart gently.\u201cBe careful not to leave your bed until the Lady wakes up.\u201dSylvia\u2019s eyes were closed on purpose, as if she were fainted, but she opened her eyes at Pamela\u2019s voice from above, to ask what she should do in the future. But she was feeling unusually heavy and couldn\u2019t even move one finger, and suddenly was overwhelmed with fear.She tried to say something in a hurry, but began to get distracted. She struggled sadly with her immobile hands, but finally gave up her spirit with a rush of drowsiness.******Click! Her employer\u2019s word was right, he\u2019d let her out within a day. Julietta jumped to her feet when the chief guard told her to come out, and suddenly stopped. She remembered rubbing her face with frustration, thinking she might die soon.The chief guard freaked out when the maid who His Highness had cared enough about to come down to see the situation in person left her cell and suddenly stripped off the dirt from the dirty prison walls and rubbed her face with her hands.He couldn\u2019t figure out why she was doing that, but couldn\u2019t help but try to ignore the thought that it had nothing to do with him. As he saw the ugly maid walking towards him, swaying her hips about whether her disguise was finally over, he prayed for a moment, \u2018May she never return to this prison again.\u2019\u201cGoodbye.\u201dAs he looked at the back of the maid, she said goodbye to him with a full bow and walked away. Her character was good, unlike her appearance, and he felt she was both great and pitiful.\u2014\u2013At that time, the main castle was busy welcoming Duke Kiellini, who had just left his wagon.A sharp man with gray silver hair and fierce eyes stepped in and bowed politely to Killian. \u201cYour Highness, Duke Kiellini has arrived.\u201d\u201cYour Highness, I haven\u2019t seen you in a long time. I heard that there was an irreverent movement.\u201dDuke Kiellini was escorted into the Oval Office, and saw the figures surrounding the long meeting table. He thought that it was like the Prince\u2019s Oval Office in Austern had been moved here.\u201cDuke Kiellini, I welcome you. We don\u2019t know yet if it\u2019s an irreverent move, but it\u2019s clear that someone has intended ill.\u201dDuke Kiellini handed over the silk hat and cane he was wearing to his servant, and then sat down on the side opposite Duke Martin. \u201cI\u2019m glad Duke Martin arrived on time. When I heard about the story of Count Adam suddenly visiting, I came as quick as I could. By the way, who would have done this?\u201dAlthough he did not officially support the fifth Prince, it was decided from the beginning who he, the Emperor\u2019s cousin and closest aide, would stand for.\u201cI\u2019ve deliberately quarantined Sylvia Chaister to reveal the background, so there\u2019s going to be an attempt to silence her before tonight goes by. If we look at someone who will be coming during the night to get a tail cut, we\u2019ll find out who\u2019s behind it.\u201dKillian looked at the door of the Oval Office once, and then wet his throat with the tea Albert had brought in. Duke Kiellini thought that he was waiting for Count Adam, smiled and said, \u201cThe Count came in disguised as my driver, so he drove himself to the stable. It\u2019ll take some time to get back to his original identity.\u201dAt the Duke\u2019s natural misconception, Oswald restrained himself from what he wanted to say, \u2018He\u2019s not the person His Highness is waiting for,\u2019 and tapped the unfolded list of employees of Calen Castle with his finger.\u201cIf the maid who had arrived yesterday had a grudge against anyone in Calen Castle, I think it\u2019s only because of one thing. She became your maid instead of Jeff.\u201d\u201cAre you saying Baroness Lanolf is suspicious?\u201dAt the inquiry of Duke Martin, Marquis Oswald nodded. \u201cAs soon as she came to say hello to His Highness, she expressed her dissatisfaction with the maid. And if she was told that the maid was responsible for Jeff\u2019s burns, she might have prepared revenge for the nephew she has cherished.\u201d\u201cHow about Marquis Anais?\u201dCount Valerian answered when Duke Kiellini questioned the guest who had arrived before him,\u201cThere has been no particular move, but it happened inside Calen Castle where there was no problem until after the arrival of the Marquis and his daughter, so we need to keep an eye on them. Moreover, there is something suspicious about when the Lady came and spoke to High Highness this morning. It might have been an attempt to do such a thing on purpose, to help you, and then to seize the opportunity.\u201dEveryone nodded, agreeing with what he said.\u201cThe outline will be revealed to some extent after tonight. I want you to put a maid in the room where Sylvia Chaister is locked up. However, make sure that you monitor the main castle twice as thoroughly as usual. From this moment on, no one should enter or leave the main castle without my permission. Everyone has had a hard time since yesterday. Let\u2019s get some rest.\u201d\u2014\u2014Less than half an hour after Duke Kiellini came in, Killian was staring at the door of his office, and stood up without waiting any longer.Killian had already opened the Oval Office while Duke Martin and Duke Kiellini were wondering. Marquis Oswald and Count Valerian bowed politely behind his back, and sighed softly. looking at each other.As soon as he left the office, Killian asked Albert, who was following behind him, \u201cJulietta?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve sent a message to the prison, and she is to be released soon.\u201d\u201cYes. In case she will lose the way, as the road is strange to her, send someone to pick her up. As soon as the long trip was over, she was put in jail and must have had a hard time. You\u2019ve had a lot of trouble all night, too. You\u2019re not even young, so don\u2019t tell me your back hurts again. Now go get some rest.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine, Your Highness. You\u2019re tired. Would you like me to bring your meal up to your room? There is no maid to take care of your bath and bed today, and I would like to get them taken care of.\u201dAlbert had to almost run to catch up with his tall master\u2019s stride. Stopping in front of the stairs leading up to the second floor, Killian turned around and soothedAlbert\u2019s affectionate worries.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I can do it alone. I do not have an idea of dinner, so don\u2019t forget to give a meal to Julietta when she gets back. Take care of her meals yourself from now on, so that she doesn\u2019t get caught up in the wrong stuff as she wanders around looking for a dining room.\u201dAlbert who was now taking care of the maid\u2019s meals, paused for a while, and Killian went up the stairs.Worried about his precious master\u2019s fatigue, Albert was torn for a long time between the desire to follow and take care of him, and the order given him by his master. However, it was impossible to reject the order. Looking up at the second floor with lingering eyes, he soon gave up and turned to send someone to bring Julietta back.\u2014\u2014\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Calen Castle, Part XVIIITranslator: KhanEditor: AelryinthAt from Albert\u2019s decision, Juliettareturned to the main castle in the carriage that the chief guard gave her a ride in. The chief guard was worried that someone passing by might have convulsion at her ugly figure, but she returned to her room pleasantly, thinking that a person should have a good sense of greeting.She was so happy to return to her beautiful temporary room from a damp, unpleasant prison. She should leave here soon, but Julietta decided to enjoy it while she was still here, and almost fainted when she opened the closet door to change her dusty dirty clothes.Her face in the palm-sized mirror attached to the inside of the closet door was so terrible. Julietta realized that just changing her dirty clothes did not seem to solve this serious situation.In Harrods Street, there was a separate bathroom for the maids and during the trip, they were able to wash with the leftover water after the employer washed. But here she had no idea where she could get rid of this mess.Julietta didn\u2019t want to leave the cozy, safe home after going through a lot of hardships while trying to find a dining room, and thought for a moment.Given that it was still early in the evening and the room was empty, it was highly likely that her employer had gone to eat or was working in his office. After having arrived at the castle, he had looked very busy, so she thought he had no chance to come back for a while, and she quickly stopped worrying.Rather than venturing out to find the bathroom for the maids whose location she did not know, she thought it would be better if she cleaned the bathroom after she washed herself in a hurry before the owner came.It was her advantage and disadvantage to act immediately when she thought about something. As soon as she reached a conclusion, Julietta quickly went straight to the master\u2019s colorful bathroom with her spare maid uniform.With the metum fruit juice, the naturally occurring sticky things from her face, and the make-up from the dust of the prison, her face was all the more horrifying when seen in the luxurious mirror in the bathroom. She felt like there was some strange smell on the clothes she wore, and she hurriedly took off them.Julietta turned on the gold faucet in the luxurious bathroom, pumped out the spilling water and began washing quickly.\u2018When will I be able to soak myself in a hot tub and wash myself with plenty of time?\u2019She breathed a sad sigh for a moment. But the lamentation was short, and with some anxiety, her hands moved faster and faster.\u2014\u2014The monarch\u2019s space, which occupied the entire east side of the second floor of Calen Castle, consisted of a large living room, a bedroom, a dressing room, a private office, and a reception room. Entering the innermost bedroom, Killian went out to the terrace and looked out over the dusk.Killian had never lost what he had except once. This could have been the second time.Watching the prison where Julietta had been kept overnight reminded him of her crying in fear in his arms. He didn\u2019t know who had done this, or for what purpose, but as Oswald had said, there was no guarantee that this would not happen in the future. Those he trusted and cared about would be the targets of further attacks.Killian turned around and sat on the railing, and was lost in thought as he looked at his reflection in the terrace window.\u201cBecome Emperor.\u201d In fact, his father, the current Emperor, had been preparing to make Killian a Crown Prince for a long time. Even knowing his Majesty\u2019s wishes, he had been delaying the time without showing any definite intentions until now.If he were just one of the other Princes, he would have followed his father\u2019s will without hesitation. However, Killian ran a business corporation and the Principality inherited from his maternal grandfather. He was interested in increasing what he had, but was not very happy with the idea of the Emperor\u2019s life, which would deprive him of freedom.But he knew it was something he had to decide one day, and he was not holding back the actions of those who moved to push him to the imperial throne, as he had to beat Prince Francis to survive without becoming Emperor.The other Princes, except Killian and Francis, were from not Queens but concubines, and they were unwilling to antagonize the two of them, or reveal themselves to the public.Francis had the support of the first Duke of Dudley, and Killian was the son of the second Queen, but Cordelia the Empress was his aunt, and if she hadn\u2019t died, he would have been crowned as a Crown Prince without fail.Despite all these circumstances, Killian had always wondered whether he really wanted to be an Emperor. However, it was clear that he had to get rid of his political opponents, Francis and Duke Dudley. That way, he would be able to settle the case.But after removing them and making another of the Princes, who could not touch him, into an Emperor, Killian was about to walk away from the royal family, but changed his mind yesterday.\u2018I will never lose a precious person to my political opponents again.\u2019He decided to make an example for those who wanted to hurt or take away everything that belonged to him, and to climb to the peak so that they could never think of anything like that. And he thought that it wasn\u2019t a bad idea to have a funny maid in the deepest part of the peak.Killian gradually settled his thoughts and concluded by taking time to himself for a while, and stood up, slightly rubbing his stiff eyes. He wanted to soak his body in hot water for a while after the long night.Judging how long it would take for Julietta to be released from prison and back from her meal, he thought he would have to take a bath without waiting.Killian, undressed as usual, strode across the endless spacious bedroom and into the bathroom on the other side. He burst open a heavy bathroom door with colorful patterns and stopped at the sight before his eyes.In the bathroom, decorated with pale beauty and gold decorations, thick water vapor was clouding the air. A woman with brick-and-mortar hair was staring at him, wearing nothing but pants.Standing on a small dais in a bathroom as wide as a bedroom, Julietta began to scream as soon as she came to her senses. Aahhhh!When Killian returned to his room and was lost in thought on the terrace, Julietta washed away her dirty face and body, and happily donned her wet hair and wig. It was uncomfortable to put a damp wig on her newly washed hair again, but now her wig and make-up was like a weaponthat she couldn\u2019t take off.From the pocket of the maid\u2019s suit, which was neatly placed in the corner, Julietta took out a small can of juice from the metum fruit, and she meticulously put it on her face and tried to put on her clothes, but put them down again. She had to clean the dirty bathroom, but she couldn\u2019t get the leftover suit dirty. She thought it\u2019d better clean the bathroom before she put on her coat.The door suddenly opened just as Julietta had finished cleaning quickly before her employer with a difficult personality returned, and she had just up the clothes she had put away for fear of getting wet. Her employer was supposed to still be in his office or eating, but opened the bathroom door with a naked body.The unexpected advent of her employer made Julietta stiff. She felt a greater sense of crisis that she didn\u2019t wear glasses than she was naked. She began to scream, covering her face with the clothes she was holding.If others were caught naked, they would be busy covering up their bodies, but his maid was something unusual. Screaming to the point of fear that everyone in the castle would jump, she was covering her face and head instead of covering her naked body.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Calen Castle, Part XIXTranslator: KhanEditor: Aelryinth\u2018Do you think it\u2019s all covered if you just cover your head and face?\u2019Killian\u2019s brow furrowed at once as the entrance was noisy even before he could appreciate enough of the big breasts, slender waist, and slim legs seen beyond the steam.\u201cYour Highness, are you all right?\u201dThe front of the bedroom was buzzing with knights attracted by the screams from the Lord\u2019s bedroom.\u201cStop. Don\u2019t move a step from the spot. I\u2019m fine.\u201d\u201cYour Highness, we can\u2019t do that. We need to check your safety.\u201dKillian sighed at the stubborn request of the knights. Once again looking toward Julietta, he reluctantly headed for the bedroom door.As soon as he opened the bedroom door, the knights checked his safety. Killian went to them with a naked body, and beckoned them to step back in an imposing manner.\u201cThe maid just slipped in the bathroom. Don\u2019t bother me.\u201dThe knights hesitated just for a moment, as they had been on strict watch and only a maid with a strange figure had entered. However, they did not see any suspicious signs, and the monarch ordered them to step down as if nothing was wrong, so they made the decision to retreat at once.When Killian saw they were leaving, he went back to the bathroom.In the meantime, Julietta had quickly put on her dress. She grumbled a little at the return of the Prince.\u201cI thought you were going to eat\u2026\u201dKillian, stunned by the nuances of why he came so fast, laughed. He felt sorry after being interrupted by them, but he was relieved to see her lively after she had been in prison for two days.\u201cHave you been waiting for my bath in a long time?\u201d\u201cNo, I was just cleaning the bathroom because it was too dirty. I took off my clothes for a while because I was afraid they would get dirty,\u201d Julietta quickly lowered her eyes and replied politely. Killian\u2019s mouth went up further when he saw her wet hair and noticed what she had done in the bathroom.\u201cThen I have nothing to do with that. Have you eaten?\u201dHer strangely smiling employer made Julietta nervous for some reason. She didn\u2019t know if her excuse had worked, but she felt a shiver go down her spine to see him smiling.It had been strange when he had visited the prison yesterday. But she had only thought that he had comforted her by rousing his sympathy from deep within when he had seen her poor situation. She had been crushed by the prison environment, so she had buried her face in her employer\u2019s chest and cried.But as the kindness remained to this day, Julietta began to feel uneasy.\u2018Why did you. who used to make me sleep on the floor beside the bed in case of an assassin. become so friendly?\u2019\u201cOh, not yet.\u201dKillian\u2019s eyes were more curved coquettishly as she replied astringently. \u2018It came out; look at that coquettish smile.\u2019Once, not a long time ago, she remembered what had happened in the theater: a monster that had sprayed pheromones on her, who had been trembling in fear.Even then, his voice had fallen so low that he had gazed at her, licking his lips slowly with his tongue as if he had a delicious prize in front of him.\u2018Warning, Warning.\u2019Suddenly, she had an illusion that she had heard the voice of the manager of the dimensions, Manny. She wanted to get out of here quickly, but the man blocking the door seemed to have no intention of getting out of the way.Killian smiled even more slowly at Julietta who sought a chance to escape with a great deal of strain. If he didn\u2019t want to be taken away, he would have to make her his, and if the seat was in danger, he would have to make it cozy. He spoke in a softer voice to relax her, as if he was soothing a cat with her hair on end.\u201cYes, then you must be very hungry. It must have been hard for you to go through such hardships as soon as you had arrived. Why don\u2019t you have a nice meal and a good rest, I\u2019ll have Albert bring you dinner?\u201d\u2018In my bed.\u2019Killian always condescended to the woman coming first, but he was seducing the woman in front of him for the first time. The problem was that he was coaxing her with food, as if soothing a hungry street cat.Julietta hesitated for a moment when she saw Killian reaching out. \u2018Are you really trying to feed me?\u2019When she had been inside the prison, food came that was hard to taste at ordinary times, but she could not have eaten. At the combination of hunger, fatigue from not sleeping properly, and languishing after a bath, she took a step unknowingly, forgetting the warning light that had been flashing above her head.As Killian\u2019s mouth went up to the limit, she heard a knocking at the bedroom door. The loud noise brought Julietta back to her senses. She slipped out like a lightning bolt past Killian, who was distracted by the knock, and threw open the bedroom door.\u201cOh, Julietta. You are back.\u201d\u2018Why are you so friendly?\u2019Killian glared fiercely at Oswald\u2019s colorful blonde hair over Julietta\u2019s head.\u201cThe Marquis, your concern has given me a safe return.\u201dJulietta welcomed the Marquis with as much of a smile as she could show for the one who had saved her from this dangerous employer. Alarmed by the maid\u2019s exaggerated smile, Oswald\u2019s eyes carefully moved into the room.\u201cOh, Your Highness. Did I visit you while you were in trouble?\u201dOswald alternately saw Killian staring at him naked at the bathroom door and the maid who opened the door with pleasure, and sounded rather sorry. He protested to Killian who didn\u2019t release his face at all, despite his exaggerated gesture of appeasement.\u201cBut it was really urgent. Sylvia Chaister has a problem with her body. The doctor is looking at it now, but it\u2019s a total paralysis. She can only move her eyes, not even a finger.\u201dThe matter of intruding on his personal time was disgraceful, but it was a matter of concern. Killian quickly gave some orders while donning the clothes he had taken off.\u201cFrom now on, tighten security for the entire area of Calen Castle and keep an eye out for any rat to come in and out. Assign an escort and watchman to the party of Marquis Anais in outer castle. Tell Valerian to go himself. Is Adam back?\u201d\u201cYes, Your Highness. I\u2019m sure the Count has an update now.\u201dWith a nod at Oswald\u2019s answer, Killian finished dressing, and looked back at Julietta. \u201cAlbert\u2019s going to bring a meal for you. Eat and rest well.\u201dJulietta looked at the back of her employer who had busily disappeared and mumbled, \u201cHow can his mood change as easily as that? It was really dangerous before. Is that the so-called devilish charm?\u201dShe went back to her nest to dry her wet hair before the meal arrived, shuddering unknowingly.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\u201cShe can\u2019t speak at all?\u201d\u201cI wonder if her words as well as her mind are sound. She doesn\u2019t respond at all. At this rate, she can\u2019t eat food, so she\u2019s going to starve to death soon.\u201dAt the doctor\u2019s words, Killian stared down at the prostrate Silvia.\u201cWhat about sending her to Vicern?\u201d\u201cShe won\u2019t be able to hold on for the trip.\u201d\u201cWhat is the cause? Is it poison?\u201d\u201cIt may or may not be so. If it\u2019s poison, it\u2019s the one I\u2019ve never seen before. But it\u2019s hard to say, as there\u2019s never been such a case to say that a mental shock has caused a total paralysis. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201dKillian looked back at his aides waiting for him. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\u201cThere are only three people who have approached her. The maids and the Baroness who brought Sylvia Chaister to this room after she fell. But we can\u2019t look into them without clear evidence,\u201d Oswald replied after Adam said that it was not a natural paralysis.\u201cIf she was dead, we could have interrogated them, but the doctor couldn\u2019t conclude anything about the paralysis. I don\u2019t know who she is, but she was clever.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t know who she is, but I think everyone has the same person in mind, right?\u201dKillian left the room as he was saying this, as if he didn\u2019t have to stay any longer. Oswald glared at the motionless Lady Chaister and hurried out after Killian.\u2014\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Calen Castle, Part XXTranslator: KhanEditor: Aelryinth\u201cWhat do you want to do with Sylvia Chaister?\u201d They had followed Killian to the room, and he glared at the three who sat huddled in his private office. But they seemed to have no intention of loosening their lips, ordering tea unabashedly.\u201cLet it go, because the doctor said she is going to die soon. If she\u2019s dead, send her body back to the family of Chaister.\u201d Oswald said about the treatment of the fallen Sylvia with a smile on his face, as if he kept protested that work had kept chasing him into the office.\u201cWill you leave the family of Chaister alone?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t do that. I\u2019ll deprive him of his title of Viscount and property. Sylvia Chaister\u2019s official charge is deception. She broke in to poison me, but she was caught by my private maid and she made it up. Fortunately, with Duke Martin\u2019s testimony, she failed to frame the maid. Announce that she has attempted to commit suicide.\u201d\u201cSuicide?\u201d Adam protested, seeing the Prince was going to cover it up like this.\u201cSylvia Chaister can\u2019t open her mouth anyway. A witness who can\u2019t testify about who is behind the scenes is useless. So, I\u2019d rather put all the sins on Chaister and trample on just one person thoroughly.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure she didn\u2019t do it alone. What are you going to do about the person behind the scenes?\u201d\u201cFrancis will be here soon, so there is no need to mess up in return for finding someone behind the scenes with no evidence. I want you to finish this work today. But keep a close watch on the Baroness, especially after Francis arrives, whether she contacts him or shows any strange signs.\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2013Killian called Albert close after they all stepped down after a brief meeting. \u201cWhat about Julietta?\u201d\u201cI just brought her a meal.\u201d\u201cGet a servant and a maid to replace Jeff and Julietta.\u201d\u201cA maid is supposed to follow us as she gets from Austern, so she\u2019ll be here soon. Then, why did you suddenly say that all of a sudden?\u201dAlbert asked carefully because his master was strange, asking him to find a new maid to replace Julietta, whom he loved so much, to the extent of taking care of every meal.\u201cWhen Julietta and I are alone in the bedroom in the future, Albert, you shouldn\u2019t let yourself in.\u201d\u201cYour, Your Highness?\u201dIt was saying that Julietta would be the woman of his master. Ignoring the stunningly surprised look in Albert\u2019s unbelieving eyes, Killian kept giving orders.\u201cI will give her a seat even in the Imperial Castle when I go back to Austern. So be prepared accordingly.\u201dIt was an indication that she was different from the women of Harrods\u2019 mansion. Giving a seat in the Imperial Castle meant that Julietta\u2019s status would change, and the mouth of Albert, who understood the meaning, was wide open. But Killian only got up after saying what he had to say.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Julietta breathed a sigh of relief, smoothing down her chest as her employer left the room. She was so relieved that she wasn\u2019t caught with a bare face, but she felt so embarrassed that she was going to die.Julietta had been struggling for a long time, and jumped up.\u2018Well, he\u2019s naked every day, so I can treat it like that. Let\u2019s think of it as having casual conversation.Well, it\u2019s my loss to waste energy on what happened if I\u2019m ashamed of it, as I have so many hard and tiring things in my life. Let\u2019s get some sleep.\u2019She didn\u2019t care about what the private thing that had happened, but after laying hypnotized herself jumped up again in less than ten minutes. Hunger kept her awake. He had said he would send her a meal, but she had forgotten after she had dried her hair and struggled with shame.Julietta decided to make plans for her future job before the meal came up, and recalled Marquis Anais, as she took out her pouch full of money from her bag. When something dangerous had happened to her, the first person that came to mind was the Marquis. It seemed to her that she had been expecting something from him without knowing.Julietta shook her head quickly, thinking of Marquis Anais and the daughter she had seen in the theater before. Seeing his visit to the theater to enjoy the opera affectionately for his daughter\u2019s coming-of-age ceremony, it was clear that he had wanted to forget that there was another daughter in one corner of the theater.She remembered the day when she was five years old when she had been evicted from a cozy mansion. Stella\u2019s heartbroken image as she had asked the gatekeeper, Zimmer, to tell him that when the Marquis had returned, they would be at the Eileen Theater.But the Marquis had not come, and suddenly, Maribel had moved Stella and Julietta, who had been living in a warehouse on the first floor, into her secret room at the innermost part of the theater to live in hiding. It had been after Stella\u2019s death that Julietta, who had been hiding like that for six months, had been freed after she had begun applying the juice of the metum fruit to her face, and wearing a stiff red wig over her head.Julietta recalled her gloomy past, and thought she was lucky that her employer had saved her. If she had asked Marquis Anais with the expectation of being her father and been rejected, she would have been hurt. She thought it would be better to just pretend that they didn\u2019t know each other, and to leave him as a person to depend on only as someone who she would ask for help when something difficult happened.Julietta thought she felt depressed because she was thinking something strange, and put her pouch firmly back in her bag.*******Duke Kiellini left the Oval Office on the pretext of tiredness as the Prince went up to the room. The Duke entered the VIP guest room, guided by the waiting servant of Calen Castle, and asked his servant who had already arrived, \u201cIs that the maid who was locked up in prison?\u201d\u201cYes, Your Excellency. It was almost in vain for us to come here. I\u2019m glad we arrived on time.\u201dKiellini nodded and agreed. \u201cThat\u2019s a relief. It\u2019s not easy to find the right person. Now that she\u2019s been through a near-death experience, it\u2019s even more likely that she won\u2019t turn down our offer.\u201d\u201cAre you going to tell her when she goes back to Austern?\u201d\u201cI think it would be timely for me to suggest, as the maid Countess Auguste recommended will arrive soon.\u201dDuke Kiellini recalled a meeting with the owner of the Eileen Theater whom he had secretly met two months ago.\u2014\u201cYour Excellency, it\u2019s an honor to have you here\u201d Maribel, who seemed no older even several years later, officially came to greet him at the box seat he had arrived at to see the opera.\u201cMaribel, long time no see. Thank you for taking the time.\u201d Though she was a woman he despised, Kiellini gently greeted her without showing his reluctance.\u201cI should thank you for visiting us like this.\u201d Maribel greeted him with the utmost politeness, hiding her curiosity as to why the head of the family of Kiellini, the maternal family of the Emperor, and the most prestigious family, visited her.\u201cI don\u2019t have much time left until the curtain rises, and I don\u2019t want to hear anything about it, so I\u2019ll say just the main point. Find a girl in her late teens with blond hair and green eyes.\u201dMaribel was surprised at the words of Duke Kiellini.For a long time, she had been a matchmaker for actresses who wanted sponsors, apprentices who wanted wealth and luxury, and aspiring actresses who visited the theater. She connected them to aristocrats and wealthy merchants, which had helped the Eileen Theater become the continent\u2019s best theater.Just in time, the right kid had refused to accept her suggestion with firm confidence, and had gone out and had a hard time. Normally, she would have pushed ahead as planned without a word, but as she had taken care of her, she had showed rare compassion and listened to the child\u2019s request.Maribel was proud of her coming back to pay the money every month. Julietta was one of the few people she cared so rarely about, and she waited for the day that returned every month.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Calen Castle, Part XXITranslator: KhanEditor: AelryinthHowever, she was confident that he would not be on the list of her clientele. Therefore, after the death of his wife ten years ago, he had only raised one daughter and thoroughly confined himself at home without any rumors, so she was surprised by the words of the Duke when he suddenly visited.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but may I ask what you\u2019re looking for? As you know, blondes and green eyes are hard to find. What\u2019s more, in order to not miss someone, I should know what\u2019s going on, then I can find the right person.\u201dAt Maribel\u2019s careful question, Duke Kiellini frowned for a moment and then opened his mouth. \u201cI know your words are sealed.\u201dHowever, when he shut his mouth as if he had no intention of telling her why, Maribel asked again, \u201cYour Excellency, I\u2019ve been able to survive here for decades because I immediately forget what I hear.\u201dHe knew that. That was why he had visited her.He had been looking for a suitable girl since last year to carry out what he had been thinking for years, but she wasn\u2019t easy to find. Most people in Austern had brown hair and eyes, although about one percent of the population had bright hair and eyes, as did the neighboring country of Vicern. When he found a suitable child, she was shallow or her figure was too ugly, and could not be said to be blonde or green-eyed.Duke Kiellini, his hands clasped, settled his thoughts and opened his mouth as if he had made up his mind. \u201cI need a daughter\u2019s substitute.\u201dMaribel lost the calm face she used when dealing with aristocrats, and her eyes went wide.\u201cYou must know that my daughter went down to Kiellini Territory and grew up there after my wife died.\u201d\u201cYes, Your Excellency. I also know that this year is Princess Kiellini\u2019s debut year in society. I heard that everyone is looking forward to seeing your daughter\u2019s social debut this year, because she\u2019s been confined at the Territory without any interaction with other young people.\u201dAt the words of Maribel, the expression of Duke Kiellini became serious. \u201cIris is very weak. Most of the time, she is reading books or looking out the window in bed. She can\u2019t handle taking a walk for a while once a day.\u201d\u201cAnd so?\u201d\u201cThis year Iris will have the coming-of-age celebration and she will have to make an official announcement as the successor to the family of Duke Kiellini.\u201dThe Ducal Families of Kiellini and Dudley, who had received their Titles from the first Emperor of Austern, passed on the title with the priority of direct descendant, regardless of gender. In particular, the family of Duke Kiellini who had produced the Empress had been a family with many female dukes, as their descendants had been scarce for generations. However, if there was no direct lineage, or if the person had a disability or were sick, a collateral line could inherit the title.At present, the family of Kiellini had no direct line except Iris, so if she did not succeed at the title, and the Title would be handed over to a collateral line that had been split off several generations ago.It did not matter while Duke Kiellini was alive, but after he died, Iris\u2019s life would be dominated by the new Duke, who had no acquaintance with her. He wouldn\u2019t worry if the heir to the title was a decent man, but since the man did not have a good character, it made the Duke worry.Duke Kiellini was unable to entrust Iris to an uncertain future. The noble bloodline of the family of the Duke, which had been falling for generations, was of no importance before the future of his daughter. He just wanted her to live in a safe and cozy place where she had lived all her life until now.\u201cIt\u2019s not enough to have blonde hair and green eyes to replace the Princess.\u201dMaribel nodded as if she had grasped the situation.\u201cThat\u2019s why I came to visit you.\u201dMaribel thought of Julietta. She had never seen Princess Kielini, but she knew she was the same as the late Duchess. The Duchess was the younger sister of Marquis Anais. In other words, the Princess and Julietta were cousins.\u2018Is this the fate of Julietta?\u2019Maribel had had to promise when sending the dead Stella\u2019s body to Marquise Anais: the Marquis should never know about Julietta. The condition was forgiving Maribel, who had given Stella and Julietta a place to sleep.From then on, Maribel had changed Julietta\u2019s appearance and sent her out of her living quarters, completely hiding her identity, so that she could stay like other members of the theater\u2019s apprentices.When Julietta had become an adult, she had felt sorry for the child who had hidden in the corner of the theater in disguise for all of her life. So, she had decided that it would be better for her to live a luxurious life as a concubine of nobility, like other actresses, so she had tried to introduce her to Duke Miguel for the price she had proposed. Of course, Julietta\u2019s resistance had pushed the plan apart.Maribel wanted to praise herself for listening to Julietta\u2019s cheeky demand that day. With a moment of sympathy and loss, she had a greater chance.It wasn\u2019t a bad thing for Julietta, either. Rather than suffer as a maid for life, she would be considered a substitute, but she would be a princess of Kiellini. However, it was not possible to introduce Julietta to the Duke without thinking about what would happen later.\u201cI\u2019ll wipe out what I\u2019ve faced with you right after this is over, and everyone involved in this matter is as well.\u201dWhen asked if he would guarantee safety after work, the Duke immediately accepted. \u201cOf course. What can I do with someone who has never faced me?\u201dNow that she\u2019d heard this, it was hard for her to take her foot off. Julietta was the illegitimate child of Marquis Anais. It was thought that if the Duke knew the truth of the family of the Marquis, if he knew how much the Marquis cared about Julietta, he would not harm the child and turn himself against the Marquis.Maribel finally made up her mind and opened her mouth. \u201cThere\u2019s a perfect girl now. I saw the Duchess in the distance, and I heard the Princess looked a lot like the Duchess.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. That\u2019s why I\u2019m looking for a blonde, green-eyed girl. It\u2019s a hallmark of the family of Anais. I haven\u2019t seen him in a long time, but I also heard that Pierre, the son of the Marquis, is blond and has green eyes.\u201dMaribel smiled brightly and agreed enthusiastically, \u201cYes. I\u2019ve seen him before, when he came to the theater. It was not pinkish or light blond, but his eyes were really bright green, like an emerald with no impurities. The child I know has that kind of eyes. She\u2019s also a pinkish, light blond.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a rare color. Where did you get to know such a child?\u201dMaribel smiled even louder when Duke Kiellini asked in wonder, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I\u2019ve been hiding for ten years now, since you\u2019ve told me about some really important secrets.\u201dAs Maribel stopped talking for dramatic effect, Duke Kiellini looked at her as if to say something.\u201cYou know that Marquis Anais had an illegitimate child, right?\u201d\u201cI thought she died with her mother.\u201dIt had already been more than ten years. Duke Kiellini could not have paid attention to the case, since his wife had been dead and his sick daughter had been in a life-and-death situation. Later, he had heard that the lover and daughter who had been driven out by Marquise Anais had died, but that was just it.\u201cI was in charge of the daughter. At the order of Marquise Anais, I hid her identity completely.\u201dAt Maribel\u2019s words, Duke Kiellini straightened himself. as if he were about to rise from his seat.\u201cWhere\u2019s the daughter?\u201d\u201cThe Marquise had hoped that an eye-annoying bastard would stay in the theater all her life, and that\u2019s what she knows now\u2026 but the girl left me a while ago. She\u2019s working as a maid at Bertino mansion on Harrods Street.\u201d\u201cA maid? If she works at Bertino mansion, she\u2019ll have too many people recognize her, even if she were to serve as a substitute.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Calen Castle, Part XXIITranslator: KhanEditor: AelryinthMaribel smiled merrily as he shook his head, as if it could not be.\u201cThe girl is very good-looking. I was afraid she would be touched by other hands in the theater. So, accepting the demands of the Marquise and to protect her, I kept her appearance hidden from childhood. But it was highly commendable for this child to keep her disguise on when she worked as a maid, saying that she didn\u2019t want to be subjected to harsh conditions. If Your Excellency were to see her in person, you\u2019ll see what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s grown up in disguise since she was a child, no one knows what she looks like?\u201d\u201cYes. She\u2019s always been in disguise since she was five. I and the two employees who have taken care of her are the only ones to have seen her face bare.\u201dThe Duke\u2019s expression, which had been hard all along, finally loosened softly. \u201cYou\u2019ll need a dead body in the theater sooner or later.\u201d\u201cYes, Your Excellency. A poor orphan child I\u2019ve cared for since she was a child is going to get sick and die.\u201dThe eyes of Duke Kiellini and Maribel met. A moment later, when the Duke nodded, Maribel rose from her seat and bowed politely.\u201cI hope you have a great time and hope to see you often in the future.\u201d\u2014\u201cYes, what?\u201dAlbert looked carefully at the maid in front of him who asked back in surprise, raising her thick glasses. Although he seriously agonized over whether His Highness was ill, he spoke again because he needed to fulfill the order.\u201cHis Highness will take Miss Salmon as his concubine. Please serve His Highness only until a new maid arrives from Austern. You only have to serve in the bedroom. My servant will be in charge of external affairs. When a new maid arrives, there will be a formal announcement of Ms. Salmon\u2019s identity.\u201dAt Albert\u2019s careful speech with honorific words, Julietta seemed about to faint.\u2018Did this happen because of yesterday\u2019s incident? But why me? There are beauties everywhere who are trying so hard to get their employers\u2019 attention, why?\u2019\u201cWell, the grand chamberlain. I\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t intend to.\u201dAt Julietta\u2019s refusal, Albert was stunned. A maid kicked out of a glorious seat\u2026 his heart sank in the discerning eye of the Prince.\u201cWhy, why, why are you refusing?\u201d Albert took out his handkerchief to dry the sweat that never came out, grabbing his spirit of passing by.\u201cThink about it. I\u2019ve seen all of His Highness in Harrods\u2019 mansion, and you want me to be a lover of him? I can\u2019t do it. If I am in that mood, His Highness and other women\u2019s actions will dance in my head.\u201dStanding by for Killian in the morning, she was relieved to see that her employer was no different than usual. It was unfair to her that she couldn\u2019t sleep well.Furthermore, the Prince generously left the room for the morning meeting and told Julietta to rest today because she had been in jail for two days. But what a ridiculous situation this was!Albert\u2019s face was blacked out by Julietta\u2019s reasoned refusal. He could not say the words, \u2018You are arrogant. How dare you refuse His Highness?\u2019 He even thought that the Prince might be ashamed of his past.Albert, who thought he should speak to the Prince again, said soothingly, \u201cMiss Salmon, I understand what you\u2019re talking about. His Highness is out to check the location of the upcoming hunting competition, so I\u2019ll tell him as soon as he gets back.\u201dWhen Albert who had nothing to say said that, Julietta felt regret. It was because it wasn\u2019t something she could say no to. However, it was not a matter to agree to.Even though the Prince was terribly handsome and sexually attractive, the position of Prince\u2019s concubine was not appealing to her in the least. She had dreamed of an ideal man who was friendly and just for her. Considering the situation of her mother and herself who had been abandoned overnight, it didn\u2019t matter how honorable the seat was in the eyes of others.Although she had driven them out coldly, Julietta understood the Marquise a hundred times.\u2018Who would want to share her man with another woman?\u2019She didn\u2019t want to be the Prince\u2019s concubine and grab the hair of a woman who would become an Empress, or other women\u2019s.Above all, of course, she couldn\u2019t do anything about what would happen due to the curse of Manny after revealing her appearance, and the disguise she had hidden so far would also be discovered. She never wanted to go through the adventure that would take place when the maids told someone, \u2018You are more beautiful than Julietta,\u2019 to please a mistress who would try to look good for the Prince.Julietta asked Albert, who had risen with a dark face, and politely bowed deeply, \u201cPlease speak well to His Highness. But I can\u2019t do it even if you want. When will he be back?\u201d\u201cHe has to look at all the hunting grounds, so I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll stay there today and be back tomorrow afternoon. Then, rest well until then. I\u2019ll bring your meal up to your room.\u201dWhen Albert said goodbye with unquestionable courtesy and left the room, Julietta returned to her room next to the dressing room and opened the closet door. The clothes that had been dirtied in the prison were still in the corner without being washed, but she couldn\u2019t afford to pack them.Taking a precious glass bottle from the pouch lying on the floor of the closet and putting it down on the table, she put in a small bag containing a feather pen and belongings in her pocket, and her only pajamas.It would be conspicuous to carry her luggage out as she sneaked out. Even though she felt sorry for the only bag, she decided to give it up and hid the pouch in her clothes.Julietta calmly escaped the Prince\u2019s space as she tried to disguise her bulging breasts as much as possible. The knights were as unshakable as the stone statues and showed no interest in the monarch\u2019s maid leaving the room. They immediately cut off their gaze of the tacky maid disappearing towards the stairs, busily shaking her hips.She walked through an empty corridor without any interruption and went out through the passage for the maids on the other side. It was the entrance shown her by an aristocratic woman who had put herself in a trap. Right after leaving this entrance, she had shouted that she was beaten by Julietta.As she walked past the place where she had been set up and down the road leading to the outer castle, Julietta thought she would take off her wig as soon as she left the castle. The Prince might not try to find her if she ran away, but there was no harm in being careful, as he might have followed her, thinking this was a shame.Julietta, who was busy walking was nervous and slightly sidetracked when she heard the carriage approaching from behind her.\u201cYour Excellency, isn\u2019t that the maid in front of us?\u201dTomas, Duke Kiellini\u2019s servant, saw a woman in a brown dress walking on the edge of the road leading to the gate and informed his master. Duke Kiellini was coming out to the street to buy a gift to commemorate his visit to Bertino for his daughter.When he and Thomas heard that the party of the Prince was on the land of Count Baden, they ran the wagon at dawn and arrived in the morning, and now saw Julietta coming out of a blacksmith\u2019s workshop. As Maribel had explained, the fat lady with the ugly brick-colored hair was walking toward the inn where the Prince was staying, shaking her big hips, as if she were excited about something.At the words of Thomas, Duke Kiellini raised himself from the backrest. He knocked the ceiling to stop the carriage.\u201cBring the maid.\u201dAt his command, Thomas hurried off the wagon and caught up to Julietta, who was walking busily along. He pointed out the carriage to the maid looking at him in astonishment. Julietta was led up to the carriage by Thomas.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It\u2019ll take a long time to walk.\u201dShe hesitated for a moment at the kindness of the nobleman she had seen for the first time. She always thought, \u2018Let\u2019s be careful about kindness without a price\u2019, but it seemed that it would be easier to get out of the gate in the Duke\u2019s carriage than to give a lame excuse about walking away.Julietta stopped agonizing, thanked him, and got into the carriage.Kiellini observed the girl sitting carefully in the chair opposite him. It was amazing that she disguised herself to protect herself, but she was no ordinary child to take up the position of a private maid of the Prince just months after she had started as a maid.Today, the Prince had left the castle with all his aides to inspect the hunting grounds. They would not have let a maid who had first visited Bertino outside of the castle on an errand, and even so, there was no way to walk out of the castle without a carriage.He didn\u2019t know what was going on, but the Duke somehow thought he shouldn\u2019t miss the current opportunity. He smiled awkwardly and spoke to the girl sitting uncomfortably across from him, \u201cI had something to tell you now, and I think it\u2019s a special fate that we\u2019re meeting like this.\u201d\u201cDo you know me?\u201d Julietta\u2019s eyes were drawn to the wonder of what the Duke had to say to her.\u201cI\u2019ve heard from Maribel about you.\u201d Julietta blushed as soon as the Duke finished speaking.\u2018I\u2019m paying off my debts, but she still hasn\u2019t given up the idea of selling me out?\u2019Kiellini spoke calmly to the frightened girl, who looked as if she would jump out of the carriage at any moment, \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re thinking, but you shouldn\u2019t be so scared, so rest assured.\u201dHe was a sharp-looking man with grayish silver hair and green eyes, neatly combed back. Julietta thought that he was not a lascivious man, seeing the Duke clicking his tongue in disapproval.\u201cDo you have anything to say to me?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to offer you a job. It\u2019s far beyond the maid you\u2019re working as.\u201dJulieta\u2019s head tilted slowly to one side at the sudden job offer. As soon as she got out of Ricaren, she would try to take off her disguise and get a job, but a job just rolled in by itself. However, she did not know what it was like to be, incomparable to a maid?The Duke went straight to the point when Julietta showed interest in what he said. \u201cI have a daughter who is set to make her social debut this year. She\u2019s my successor. But the problem is that it\u2019s hard for her to come forward and do an overall event to receive the title of the Duke, because she\u2019s very weak.\u201dKiellini shut his mouth and looked out the window for a moment.\u2018If I could take away the girl\u2019s health right in front of me, and give it to Iris, how happy I would be! Even if it goes according to the plan, after this year, the child will have to hide herself as a ghost as if she were dead inside the Territory.\u2019It was so sad, so pitiful and so unfair.He could do everything for her, but the only thing he could not do was the health of his daughter. He couldn\u2019t give it to her, so he wanted to take someone else\u2019s health and hold her place.Kiellini turned back to the maid looking at him without a word. When the Duke\u2019s gaze returned to her, Julietta opened her mouth, \u201cI understand. Are you saying that your daughter has all the authority as a de facto successor, but she\u2019s weak, so I have to do external activities as a substitute?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. You understand fast. No one knows that my daughter, Iris, is in poor health. Naturally, they would think the next successor will come out of the other collateral line. Therefore, it is necessary to warn them that Iris is not seriously ill and that they should not even think about succession, while you complete my daughter\u2019s social debut at the coming-of-age ceremony as a substitute. That way, they won\u2019t make any unnecessary noise, even if my daughter confines herself in the Territory after that.\u201d\u201cHow long do I have to work as a substitute? No matter how much money you give me, I can\u2019t continue to be a scarecrow.\u201dIt was a great opportunity. From Julietta\u2019s point of view, taking off her disguise was more of a cover-up, so the offer to wash her identity and receiving some money was a real good chance. However, since she didn\u2019t want to live her entire life as a part of someone else\u2019s character, she had to figure out exactly when that period was.\u201cOnly during this summer`s social season. If you finish your debut party safely and get everyone\u2019s recognition as the successor to the family of Kiellini, your role will end.\u201d\u2018Iris is weak, and unable to marry or have children. We will look for a young man who can form a political alliance or share this secret. It would be nice if he has a child outside, and if he doesn\u2019t, she could adopt a suitable one. In any case, she will show that there is no problem as a successor, go to the Territory for a change of air and spend her entire life there. Then the rest of Iris\u2019 life will be kept safe.\u2019\u201cBut I think I missed one thing. Do your daughter and I resemble each other a lot?\u201dJulietta tilted her head, thinking, \u201cI don\u2019t think the daughter of the gentleman like that would have had brick hair and dark skin. I heard from Maribel that you were the illegitimate child of the Marquis. He is Iris\u2019 uncle.\u201dKiellini nodded as Julietta was apparently embarrassed by the relationship of the family registry he mentioned all of a sudden.\u201cShe has blond hair and green eyes. Of course, she is a lighter blonde than the Marquis, and her eyes are a green closer to blue, but since she was young, she\u2019s gone down to the land and confined herself there, so you don\u2019t have to worry about it because only a few people would remember Iris except for an image of when she was young.\u201dAt the mention of the Duke, Julietta recalled Marquis Anais, who she had seen in the theater. He had vivid green eyes reminiscent of a budding sprout, with bright blond hair that had a lighter pink color than herself. Perhaps no one would doubt that she was his niece.The Duke gazed out of the window, watching Julietta, who seemed to be thinking carefully. They would soon arrive at the gate. When negotiating, however, it was a loss to those who would express their feelings first. He told her the amount to be paid after the work was done and looked outside in a leisurely manner.Unlike him, Julietta could not help but be astonished. Ten thousand terns! The amount was enough to repay Maribel\u2019s debts and open a store!\u2018Good luck comes to those who want to grab it. I\u2019m not going to be frightened beforehand and run away.\u2019Many things were on her mind, but Julietta didn\u2019t mean to miss the opportunity that came to her.\u201cPlease fill out a contract stating the exact length of time and the amount to be paid to me and the provision that you will not do any harm to me after the work is done.\u201dJulietta smiled broadly at the silver-haired gentleman in front of her, taking off her wig and glasses she had been wearing.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Julietta Iris Kiellini, Part ITranslator: KhanEditor: Aelryinth5. Julietta Iris KielliniBang!The sound of a firearm going off in the woods sent the birds in the trees flying in unison.Killian fired a hunting rifle into the air to bring together the scattered group. Killian and his group were making a preliminary inspection around the course as they visited the forest where a hunting competition was to be held.\u201cIt\u2019s for a light entertainment, so I think this much preparation would be enough,\u201d Killian praised the person who was in charge of the hunting competition, and turned his horse to a tent for rest.Adam waited to greet a group of people who came back with a list of invitees.\u201dIt looks like it\u2019s going to be bigger than last year.\u201d\u201cWe can\u2019t help it, uninvited guests are rushing in like they\u2019ve promised,\u201d Killian replied disapprovingly, and leapt off the back of a giant horse that was still in a state of excitement after running through the forest in a long time. The deer that the knights had taken for trial were brought in and displayed in front of the tent.\u201cI don\u2019t like this swarming around in this way and killing animals meaninglessly.\u201d Oswald put a handkerchief sprinkled with perfume on his nose to avoid the shallow smell of blood, and managed to get off his horse with the help of a knight while complaining. He was afraid of getting the forest soil on his shoes; it had become wet and damp because of the rain pouring down in the morning, and he managed to get into the tent unscathed.Watching his boisterous behavior with a smile, Killian took off his hunting gloves and ordered a servant to bring tea.Inside the tent, which was covered by the fur of a black leopard caught three years ago, a chair with a green silk cover and a marble table made of ivory had been placed, along with a cabinet with jeweled decorations on one side. Oswald was relieved to see the familiar objects, and sat down opposite Killian and Adam.Adam made invidious remarks at Oswald, who had learned from Sir Albert to wipe away the sweat with a lace handkerchief and prepare a finger bowl, a small bowl of water for cleaning the fingers.Oswald waved his handkerchief deliberately at Count Adam, and grumbled, \u201cSo, you should have remained in the castle, but why did you insist on following us?\u201d\u201cI prefer a hunting ground to deal with Lady Anais, and I want to give some comfort to Count Valerian.\u201d Oswald washed his hands in the finger bowl the servant had prepared, and then raised them gracefully to mimic a toast.Ian, who had taken the position of a servant for Killian temporarily, prepared tea in a hurry and put it down in front of the master, but Killian was startled after he took a sip of the slightly bitter Duren tea. Oswald and Adam were grumbling at it, but also tasted the tea.\u201cOh! The tea tastes better today, and Ian wants to be promoted to your servant.\u201dAt Oswald\u2019s praise, Ian answered cautiously, serving tea, \u201cNo, sir. How dare I covet the servant\u2019s position of His Highness. You ran your horse and came here, and you feel the tea tastes better.\u201dIan was a distant relative of Albert and had begun working last year. The young man had turned nineteen this year, and had been serving for the Prince since the dinner on the first day of his arrival in Bertino, but it was the first time Killian had taken a close look at him, as he was apparently quiet.Ian\u2019s tea-boiling skill was incomparable to the tea Jeff and Julietta had made. Killian began to closely observe the servant who calmly responded to Oswald\u2019s raucous praise and stepped back.\u201cYou should be more careful about hiring people these days. Wouldn\u2019t he be better than hiring a new servant?\u201dAdam noticed Killian\u2019s intentions, and spoke low, \u201cShall Oswald look into him?\u201dKillian nodded to Oswald after being asked if he would investigate Ian\u2019s background.\u201cThis is how Jeff\u2019s position is lost.\u201d Oswald shook his head as if he were sorry.\u201cNo, Jeff\u2019s place remains the same. However, unlike before, he will be under surveillance.\u201d\u201cYou also think it was done by Baroness Lanolf.\u201d Adam nodded as he accepted the words about the person who had slandered Julietta behind the scenes. \u201cWe should trace her to the end, whether she was masterminded or driven by greed.\u201dIt was even more frightening to see his smile as he drank tea gracefully, so Oswald prayed for the repose of Baroness Lanolf in advance.\u201cIf I return to the castle, I will give Julietta an official direct assignment as a concubine.\u201d\u201cYour Highness!\u201dAdam opened his mouth to protest, but Killian\u2019s right hand flashed up as if to stop.\u201cI will never let any danger fall to the safety of the maid and the people around me again. And I will be the next Emperor to protect my people from danger.\u201dAdam and Oswald sprang to their feet and saluted the formal declaration of Killian.\u201cYour Highness, have you finally made up your mind? This Oswald will do his best to help you wear the golden crown.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the happiest day of my life. Of course, I\u2019m sure that there will be more joyful days to come.\u201dKillian received the bows of the two loyalists, and ordered them to stand up.\u201cI believe there will be no minor danger in Julietta\u2019s future.\u201d\u201cOf course, Your Highness.\u201d\u201cOf course, Your Highness. We\u2019ll prepare a wedding ceremony as soon as we get back to the castle.\u201dIt was time for Killian to laugh satisfactorily at the answer. The voice of Count Valerian who was supposed to be dealing with the Marquis in the castle was heard outside.\u201cYour Highness, it\u2019s Charles. I have something urgent to say. May I come in?\u201dThe eyes of the three met.\u201cDon\u2019t tell me, has Prince Francis arrived already?\u201d Oswald murmured unhappily.\u201cUntil we left the castle, there was no word that the Prince and his party had entered the castle of Ricaren. He might have come into the castle rudely without contact.\u201dAdam also frowned and disapproved.\u201cI\u2019ll see what\u2019s going on. Come in.\u201dWith Killian\u2019s permission, Charles came in, flapping his cloak.\u201cCharles Ebert Valerian sees Your Highness.\u201d\u201cAll right. Say what you want.\u201dKillian hastened Count Valerian who observed courtesy.\u201cYour Highness, this is a message from Sir Albert. It says that the maid Julietta disappeared from the castle. After he delivered your order to her, she completely disappeared.\u201dBoom!At the words of Count Valerian, Killian jumped up, hitting the table. \u201cDo you think she was kidnapped by a group of people plotting?\u201dAt Killian\u2019s urgent words, Valerian\u2019s expression slightly hardened in embarrassment.\u201cThe maid\u2019s personal belongings disappeared with her. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s kidnapping.\u201dKillian, wearing a cape and gloves handed by Ian, hurried to the entrance of the tent, stopped and looked back at the Count.\u201cHer belongings are gone?\u201d\u201cYes, Your Highness.\u201dAs Valerian bowed his head in a much-obliged manner, Killian\u2019s expression was slightly loosened.\u201cShe has run away.\u201d\u201cRun away? Why the hell?\u201dKillian thought for a moment, slamming his boots with a horse whip.\u201cMy street cat doesn\u2019t seem to like the newly prepared cage.\u201d\u2018Huh, she refused the courtship of the most popular and beautiful man in Austern, Prince Bertino.\u2019While Oswald muttered an unknowingly mournful sound, Adam\u2019s face brightened. \u201cOh, that\u2019s too bad.\u201d\u201cAdam, remove the smile from your mouth and say what you intend.\u201dAt Killian\u2019s words, Adam quickly changed his face. \u201cValerian, close the castle\u2019s gates and send a man to the border. Has anyone seen her leave the castle?\u201d\u201cWe have thoroughly questioned the guards of the main and rear gates of the castle and the entrance of the servants and maids, but no one saw her escape. She should have been noticed by someone.\u201dAt the words of Valerian, Killian went out of the tent and climbed up the prepared horse, saying,\u201cI want you to investigate again. Find a slim woman with red hair, not the usual fat figure. Search the whole capital city thoroughly and find her by tonight. Let\u2019s go back to the castle.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Julietta Iris Kiellini, Part IITranslator: KhanEditor: AelryinthOswald caught Count Valerian in a hurry, who was about to leave after Killian quickly disappeared with the knights.\u201cWhat is it that His Highness just said?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m just doing what he ordered me to do. Both of you, please come back to the castle as soon as possible.\u201dAs Count Valerian also disappeared, raising dust; Oswald cursed as he abandoned his usual elegant demeanor.\u201cHow did I get here\u2026 but I have to go back to the castle without a day\u2019s rest? I can\u2019t, I can\u2019t.\u201dAdam spoke to Oswald, ordering a servant to bring his horse. \u201cIf I arrive at the castle, I would like to send you a carriage, but I think His Highness will feel worse if he doesn\u2019t see you there. Why don\u2019t you just ride behind me?\u201d\u201cDo you mean for me to hang behind a man\u2019s back in a nasty way?\u201dAs Oswald fluttered his handkerchief like crazy, Adam shrugged. \u201cThen come on your own. Your horse is as gentle as a horse that noble ladies ride, so it\u2019ll take you safely on your way.\u201dOswald looked after Adam, who disappeared without asking twice, and ground his teeth furiously.\u201cIf she wanted to run away, she should have gone tomorrow! I have to use my unused muscles again without any time to rest. I won\u2019t even be able to get up tomorrow.\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013Thomas, the servant, held out the hood to Julietta, who was smiling with her colorful blond hair exposed.\u201cPut it on.\u201dThe carriage arrived at the gate at the same time Julietta gently donned the hood.\u201cYour Excellency, where are you going?\u201d The captain of the guards at the gate greeted the Duke with friendly words.\u201cI\u2019m going to buy a present for my daughter.\u201dAfter peeking inside the carriage, the captain of the guard said, \u201cPlease have a good trip,\u201d after confirming that everything was fine.The carriage safely escaped from the castle and traveled for a long time outside before stopping in a quiet place. There was a row of pretty large mansions in the quiet, deserted neighborhood, as if it were home to wealthy commoners.\u201cTurn around this building and go to the second blue roof house from the left. If you just tell a woman I sent you and show her what you are, she\u2019ll take care of you even if you won\u2019t say anything. Be careful not to reveal yourself as much as possible until you get out of Bertino. After being thoroughly educated as Princess Kiellini for two months, you will make your debut on Iris\u2019 coming-of-age day.\u201dDuke Kiellini turned his head out of the window when he said it was Iris\u2019 coming-of-age day. Julietta was sad and frightened by the look, and hurried out of the carriage. She seemed to be the one who the Duke hated the most now.After she quietly said goodbye to him, she walked around the building with the dark and narrow alleys, walked out to the side of the boulevard as she was informed, and could see a house covered with a blue roof.Knock, knock, knock\u2026While Julietta was nervous about the command to avoid being seen as much as possible, and raised her hand to knock on the door again, the door opened silently from the inside. When a woman with a silver hair and a sharp figure stared silently at her, Julietta introduced herself as Duke Kiellini had told her.\u201cDuke Kiellini sent me. My name is Julie\u2026\u201dA skinny hand grasped the arm of Julietta, who was trying to take off the hood and pulled her into the house. The woman closed the door in a hurry.\u201cTake off your hood.\u201dAt the cold voice, her blonde hair was revealed when Julietta took off her hood. The inside of the dark house glowed as if a light was turned on. The woman looked at the dazzling figure carefully, and finally opened her mouth.\u201cI\u2019m Marquise Raban. Duke Kiellini is my brother-in-law. Originally, I was supposed to prepare for Iris\u2019s social debut and chaperone her.\u201dThe stiff-talking woman\u2019s voice seemed to indicate that Iris was sick because of her. The woman stared at her, and burst into a fit of laughter as the defiant Julietta faced her coldly.\u201cAt least you have a strong enough spirit to play a fake princess. But you\u2019ll have to keep in mind that you\u2019re a fake anyway, and that you can\u2019t be real, and you can\u2019t even decide that you want to be real. If you love your life, don\u2019t have that kind of heart even later.\u201dAt Marquise Raban\u2019s words, Julietta shrugged as usual. \u201cI don\u2019t want that kind of tiring work. I just want to go and live in a place where no one knows me when this is over with the fundsHis Excellency promised me.\u201dAt Julietta\u2019s reply, Mrs. Raban smiled dryly. \u201cI\u2019m glad you understand who you are. Always make sure you don\u2019t forget what you think now.\u201dJulietta smiled radiantly at the woman who warned her with a lifeless face. \u201cMadam, do you know why I, born a bastard, have been able to survive without a guardian in a theater where I lost my parents at a young age?\u201dMrs. Raban looked silently, waiting for the reply of the dazzling, beautiful girl, like an angel who had come down from heaven.\u201cIt\u2019s because I know myself. So don\u2019t worry about it at all. I\u2019m going to do enough of what I\u2019ve been entrusted with the pay I\u2019ve received. I don\u2019t want to do anything more than that, I don\u2019t have any intentions otherwise.\u201d***\u201cThere\u2019s no sign of her being out of the gate.\u201dAdam pressed as if it couldn\u2019t be true.After returning from the hunting ground, the captain of the guard had been called before the Prince, and wanted to hide himself while reporting on what had been confirmed throughout the afternoon. He didn\u2019t know what kind of a big mistake she had made, but he had not seen the maid whom the Prince was looking for so seriously and he couldn\u2019t help, but feel uncomfortable.As the expression of Killian, who thought he could find her quickly grow more violent over time, Oswald approached the captain of the guard and whispered, \u201cIs it true that you have thoroughly scoured all the gates that are connected to the outside?\u201d\u201cYes, Your Excellency. I have thoroughly searched the castle and the city under Sir Albert\u2019s order, and I have checked the list of people who have been in and out since this morning.\u201d\u201cAnd she\u2019s not been found yet?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s why I am embarrassed. I\u2019ve stepped up security at the gates, and I\u2019ve gone through all the way out of the capital city, and I\u2019ve looked at all the places where the maid could stay, including lodgings and restaurants, but there\u2019s no sign of her.\u201dAfter watching the two whispering for so long, Killian called in the captain of the guard, \u201cI\u2019ll ask you different questions. Tell me who went out of the castle today, regardless of their status.\u201dEven more nervous at the Prince\u2019s fearsome expression, the captain of the guard wiped his sweaty hands with his pants and pulled out a list from his pocket.\u201cThe men who left the castle today were Your Highness, Marquis Oswald, Count Adam, Sir Lantern who was escorting\u2026\u201d\u201cStop! Except for those who went to the hunting ground.\u201d Killian put the brakes on the reports of the inflexible security captain.\u201cAh, yes. So, except for the group of Your Highness who went hunting, there was only one maid of the outer castle, two guardsmen, three servants who are in charge of groceries, Duke Kiellini, and Count Valerian. As soon as he found out the maid was missing, Sir Albert ordered me to close the gates, so no one has come in or out since then.\u201dKillian was lost in thought for a moment and opened his mouth.\u201cAttach people to all of them. Has anyone gone out with a party that you have never seen, among those who went out of the castle?\u201dWhen Killian asked, the captain of the guard answered after pondering, \u201cThrough the entrance of the servants and maids, people walked out without carriages, so there was no one but those who were identified. The knights rode out, and there were a servant and a maid in the carriage of Duke Kiellini. As they were the party of His Excellency, I didn\u2019t identify them separately.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Julietta Iris Kiellini, Part IIITranslator: KhanEditor: AelryinthKillian\u2019s eyes were opened in a flash at the captain\u2019s answer. He raised himself against the chair and asked Adam.\u201cDidn\u2019t you say that Duke Kiellini had come with only his servant and his driver yesterday?\u201d\u201cYes. That\u2019s right, Your Highness. The group was so simple that I asked, and he answered that he was going to accompany my father, so it was a hassle to increase the unnecessary group.\u201d\u201cThen who was the maid in the carriage?\u201d Oswald looked back at the captain of the guard in wonder.\u201cThe maid in the carriage was blonde. She was wearing a hood, but I saw it clearly.\u201d\u201cWas she wearing a hood in the carriage?\u201dAt Killian\u2019s muttering, Adam answered, \u201cThat\u2019s very suspicious.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll have a cup of tea with Duke Kiellini separately.\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014So at the tea-time arranged, Killian looked at Duke Kiellini, who was savoring the scent of tea in a relaxed manner, sitting on the opposite sofa.Certainly, the Duke\u2019s visit to the Principality of Bertino was very sudden. Even if he had traveled with Duke Martin, the trip, accompanied by only one servant, was not suitable for the procession of the Duke, who was second in the order of Austern. He felt something strange, as if he had made a very urgent decision.\u201cThe Duke, were you out today?\u201d asked Killian, observing the silver-haired Duke over the cup he was holding.\u201cYes, it\u2019s my first visit. I went out to buy a present for my daughter.\u201d The expressionless face softened for a moment as he talked about his daughter.\u201cIs Princess Kiellini going to make her debut this year?\u201d\u201cYes, Your Highness. I\u2019m in the midst of that preparation.\u201d The soft-faced Duke again lifted the teacup as if to hide his face.\u201cYou don\u2019t look well. Is her health still so bad?\u201dIt was famous that the weak Princess Kiellini had been recuperating since she was a child, living in the southern lands of the family of the Duke.\u201cNo, Your Highness. She\u2019s healthy enough to make her debut. I\u2019m always worried about her as a father.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s good to hear. I look forward to seeing the princess.\u201d\u201cIt will be my honor, Your Highness.\u201dThere was silence in the room where the conversation was over for a while.Killian suddenly opened his mouth, as if to make a surprise attack to the Duke who was drinking tea calmly. \u201cWho was the maid in the Duke\u2019s carriage today? From what I hear, you brought only one servant with you.\u201dBut despite his sudden question, the Duke remained calm. \u201cI don\u2019t know either. Just as I was on my way out, a maid was walking towards the front gate, so I just gave her a ride.\u201dKillian stared at the Duke in silence, as if to grasp the truth. Even under Killian\u2019s fierce gaze, the Duke\u2019s expression remained unchanged.\u201cI see. I heard the maid is blonde. Is that right?\u201d\u201cYes, Your Highness. She was a blonde who reminded me of my daughter, so I felt sorry as she was walking so hard, and I gave her a ride.\u201dIt was a completely unquestionable answer.\u2018In fact, there is no reason for the Duke to hide Julietta.\u2019Killian\u2019s eyes sank coldly again, as he expected that he would find out where Julietta was.After sneaking across the scene, Duke Kiellini raised the teacup again which he had put down, and asked as if it were nothing, \u201cAre you doing this because of the maid who you are looking for?\u201dKillian carefully put away his face in order, and answered the Duke\u2019s question. \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhat great sin did the maid do? You ordered all your forces to search for her.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen. As you know, she almost fell into a conspiracy of someone unknown. She\u2019s an important witness because we haven\u2019t been able to find out who was behind the scene yet. But now that she\u2019s vanished completely, we need to find out if she\u2019s involved in something else, or they\u2019re doing it to get rid of the witness.\u201dKillian\u2019s sense was telling him not to trust the Duke completely. At present, there was no doubt about the Duke at all, but it was rather awkward without realizing what was wrong.The Duke nodded as if he understood Killian\u2019s answer.\u201cI see. The maid I gave a ride to got off as soon as she arrived in the city. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s the one you\u2019re looking for, but if you ask the driver, he\u2019ll show you exactly where she got off.\u201dIt was a neat answer beyond doubt.As he had passed by her, he had given her a ride, thinking of his daughter, and dropped her off as soon as he arrived in the city. Of course, it could be true. But why was it so annoying?\u201cSure. I\u2019ll send someone over. I\u2019m sorry I\u2019ve been holding you too long this late at night.\u201dThe Duke stood up at the call to leave. \u201cIf it is not an opportunity like this, when will I be alone to talk with you again? Now that I\u2019ve come all the way to Bertino, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve guessed what I\u2019m going to do.\u201dAs if to block Killian\u2019s suspicion, the Duke expressed his support. \u201cI would have told you that I wouldn\u2019t think of if it had been a while ago, but now I\u2019m determined to be grateful for the Duke\u2019s support. Please give me a good favor in the future, too.\u201dWhen the Duke stepped down, Killian called in his aides, who were waiting in the bedroom connected to the drawing room.\u201cHow is it?\u201d\u201cThe blonde maid is the most suspicious at the moment, but her hair color is different.\u201dWhen Killian asked, Adam answered, \u201cIs there no chance it might be a wig?\u201dWhen Count Valerian spoke, Oswald shook his finger as if it could not be true. \u201cWould you wear a conspicuous blonde wig when you are on the run? If it had been me, I would never have done such a stupid thing. And where did she get a blonde wig as a maid?\u201d\u201cWell, if she was helped by someone, we don\u2019t know.\u201dKillian gave an order at Adam\u2019s words. \u201cSee if there was a blonde maid in the castle and find a woman of similar features, centered around where Duke Kiellini let her off.\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\u201cDo I have to wear a wig?\u201dNot long after she threw off her stuffy wig, Julietta had to put a black wig back on. It was a high-quality wig that was different from the previous one, but it was still frustrating.\u201cYour blonde hair was revealed when you left the gate, so the Prince`s knights are searching for a blonde maid. I don\u2019t want to be swept away by unnecessary turmoil, so stay that way until you get out of the capital safely.\u201dJulietta\u2019s mouth closed like a clam when she heard that the Prince was looking for her.\u201cWhat the hell have you been up to? They\u2019re looking for a girl who ran away.\u201dJulietta shrugged at Mrs. Raban who clicked her tongue disapprovingly. \u201cI don\u2019t know either. I almost died in a trap before I left the castle, and I think that\u2019s why they\u2019re looking for me.\u201dJulietta lied because she thought she\u2019d be sent back if she told the truth.Mrs. Raban didn\u2019t know why the Prince was still looking for her, and it seemed that he had not made much noise yet. What a disgrace! The Prince Bertino was looking for a girl who had run away because she didn\u2019t like him. The whole of Austern was disturbed by the searching.As Julietta gave her answer, the Marquise hit her slender shoulder harshly with a fan.\u201cAgain, again. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re doing this. It\u2019s impossible for a noble princess to shrug her shoulders so often in such a crude manner. Didn\u2019t you say that you would do the job as much as you received? But can\u2019t you fix a habit like this?\u201dThree days had passed since she had arrived at the house where the Marquise had stayed temporarily.The only servants and maids of this small house were Simone, a maid named Vera who looked the same age as her, and an elderly driver. They seemed to be very loyal to their master, and had served Mrs. Raban for nearly twenty years. Even so, the party a noble lady brought was so small that she would know how secret this was going.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Julietta Iris Kiellini, Part IVTranslator: KhanEditor: AelryinthCut off from the outside world, the education for Julietta began immediately after the first day. The number of times she was hit by a fan due to her habit of shrugging her shoulders for three days was considerable. When Julietta rubbed her shoulders, thinking that she would be lucky if she was not bruised, Vera approached silently and put a cold-water towel soaked in herbal water on her.Mrs. Marquis issued an impetuous order when Julietta pouted at the thought of giving her medicine.\u201cIt\u2019s only been a few minutes since you were scolded, and now you\u2019re pouting your mouth. I don\u2019t know where to start.\u201dJulietta pulled up her pouting mouth slightly. \u201cI\u2019ll be careful, ma\u2019am.\u201dThe Marquise turned away as if she were satisfied with her gracious apology.\u201cI hope you\u2019ll get rid of that vulgar habit by the time we leave for Kiellini Territory. Now that the risk of this work has increased because of the Prince, call me Viscountess Simon for the time being. Vera, I want you to put a wig on her so that the blonde hair is not noticeable right now.\u201d*******\u201cYour Highness.\u201dA week had passed since Julietta had disappeared.Killian who tentatively concluded that the maid who had been given a ride by Duke Kiellini was Julietta after confirming that there was no other blonde maid in the castle, and began searching for a girl with blonde or red hair in the Ricaren. However, the search had not gone as well as expected, as more and more guests were attending the hunt, and there could be useless scandals, so they could not look for Julietta in public.Count Valerian came to Killian with a heavy face, exhausted from dealing with Lady Anais, who came here with useless excuses. Frustrated by his dark mood, Killian asked sharply, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dValerian hesitated for a moment and finally opened his mouth, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say\u2026 The body of a young woman was found in the Dewai river.\u201dKillian jumped up, hitting the table. \u201cTell me again!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a woman with red hair.\u201dOswald and Adam lost their words and looked at Valerian, and he nodded.\u201cIt was hard to recognize the face because she was soaked in water and was wearing glasses as usual, but I couldn\u2019t mistake the unusual color of the skin and the way she was wearing clothes bigger than her body.\u201dKillian\u2019s face hardened at the contents of the gloomy report.\u201cWhere is it?\u201d\u201cI brought the body back. Do you want to check?\u201dValerian was going to say, \u201cIt\u2019s not a good thing to see as a nobleman,\u201d but shut up. The coldly sunken eyes of Killian left him unable to speak.\u201cBring it up.\u201dValerian opened the door of the Oval Office to retrieve in the body of a woman whom he had placed in front of the door, at the firm command that had come down after a long time.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Three days before the body emerged from the Dewai river, Mrs. Raban called Julietta.\u201cThe search by the Prince has not stopped yet. I\u2019ll have to go ahead with the plan.\u201dSimone looked at the girl wearing a black wig with flashing green eyes. Her blonde hair, similar to that of her niece, Iris, was covered, and she felt she could breathe now.Simone, who had become a widow shortly after her marriage, had lived for her ailing niece for a lifetime, refusing to marry again. If it wasn\u2019t for her niece\u2019s business, she would never have intervened. The future of Iris was the same as her own.When her brother, Duke Kiellini, said he wanted to look for a substitute to make a debut in society for Iris who was sick, Simone objected, saying it nonsense. But the words of Iris, who came and spoke to her, moved her, and so now she was here to educate the child who would replace her niece.\u201cAunt, please keep my seat.\u201dGlamorous blond hair very dry with long-term sickness and malnutrition, and the lovely turquoise eyes, which moved between blue and green according to the light, had long lost their light, like stained glass falling to the floor with a crack.\u201cI don\u2019t want to be kicked out of Tilia Territory where I\u2019ve lived my whole life, like my aunt who was forced out of the Raban mansion by the nephew who became the new Marquis after his uncle died without a child. I\u2019ve been in this territory all my life. Please don\u2019t let me be taken away from this, as I had to give up everything because of my health. Don\u2019t forget that I have to be the master of the family of the Duke, so security for your later years can be guaranteed.\u201dThese days, taking a walk once a day was too much for Iris. Iris\u2019 favorite place was the garden she could see out of her room.\u201cI know my father\u2019s been preparing for this for years. Getting a lot of people out of the mansion must have been part of the preparation.\u201dIt was true. Now she knew why, but in the past, Simone couldn\u2019t understand her brother\u2019s behavior.From a few years ago, her brother had begun sending out the servants and maids of the southern mansion of Kiellini, one by one. Simone had expressed discomfort to her brother when he refused to hire new people to replace those who had been sent off with hefty severance pay with reasonable excuses. At that time the Duke only said a harsh word:\u201cIris\u2019s health is getting worse. You don\u2019t want gossip about the child\u2019s health to spread around, do you?\u201dWhen she heard that, Simone shut her mouth.There were only a few servants and maids left in the spacious mansion, who had been loyal to the family of Kiellini for decades, including a butler who had served for generations and a head maid who had been a nanny of Duke Kiellini. The workers needed to manage the big mansion were then hired from the local people of the Territory, and they did not stay in the mansion long enough to meet Lady Kiellini.\u201cPlease train the child who will replace me. No one should ever know that Iris Kiellini is weak. Make her into the perfect Kiellini princess. I want to keep my place even if I have to take the child\u2019s life as security for lifetime.\u201dSimone saw Iris\u2019 bony hand clasping the armrest of the chair as if she would never let it go.***Now she was in Bertino for Iris and her future.\u201cWhat was planned before?\u201dWhen Julietta tilted her head because she did not know why, Simone\u2019s eyes became scary.\u201cA noble status never behaves vulgarly in that way. How many times do I have to tell you? Don\u2019t move your head when asked and try to answer exactly and clearly. Do you understand?\u201d\u2018I won\u2019t move, like a cast is on my neck.\u2019With her back straight and her head stiff, Julietta, grunting inwardly, asked, with only her eyes slightly down.\u201cWhat do you mean by what you planned to do before?\u201dSimone looked at Julietta\u2019s attitude as if she made a point, and gestured to Vera, who was waiting by her side. Upon receiving the instruction, Vera left the room and soon came in with a shabby brown bag. When Julietta saw the small pouch, she sprang up.\u201cThat\u2019s my baggage.\u201d\u201cSit down.\u201d\u201cDid you search my room?\u201d\u201cI said, sit down.\u201d\u201cNo matter how much I take on behalf of Lady Iris, my personality won\u2019t disappear. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re touching my luggage. If that\u2019s the case, I can\u2019t work even if you give me ten million terns.\u201dJulietta took off the wig she was wearing, threw it on the floor, and took her luggage from Vera. It was her entire fortune. It might look shabby and tacky to others, but they were the only items with memories that could prove she was herself.Simone laughed coldly at Julietta\u2019s back, as she moved towards the door, as if she were really leaving, \u201cDo you think you\u2019ll be safe knowing this huge secret? I just needed a suitable body to avoid the Prince, and that\u2019s all\u201dAt Simone\u2019s words, Julietta stopped walking.\u201cWhat do you mean, a suitable body?\u201d\u201cWe need to make him give up the search, because the Prince\u2019s pursuit is still continuing.\u201d\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 67": "Chapter 67 - Julietta Iris Kiellini, Part VPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 67. Julietta Iris Kiellini, Part VTranslator: KhanEditor: AelryinthTo do this, Duke Kiellini, Simone, and Maribel, the owner of the Eileen Theater, had met privately before departing for Bertino.From the beginning, Maribel and Duke Kielini intended to make Julietta look dead for the wife of the Marquis, who suspected Julietta\u2019s whereabouts.However, Duke Kiellini had put in a lot of effort to find a child similar to Iris. Eventually, he risked telling Maribel the secret and asked her to get a similar child. The situation was like that, and it was a serious matter getting the body to replace Julietta.Simone had just said, \u201cLet them think that Julietta has run away.\u201d However, Maribel opposed that: if Julietta\u2019s body was not found, the Marquise who would see her at the coming-of-age ceremony would be suspicious.\u201cMarquise Raban, you think about a woman\u2019s resentment too easily. Marquise Anais will never release her suspicion until Julietta\u2019s body is found. The Marquise will doubt that Marquis Anais is involved in this, and she\u2019ll dig around in the back, wondering if he\u2019s hiding his illegitimate child. By the way, what if Princess Kiellini who has been sick, suddenly appears healthy? If she looks at the same blond hair and green eyes as her husband, she\u2019ll doubt that he\u2019s the one who did it for an illegitimate child before she thinks she looks like the Duchess of Kiellini. Especially, she knows how Princess Kiellini looked like when she was young.\u201cBut it\u2019s not easy to find a body her age with blonde hair and green eyes.\u201dAt Simon\u2019s words, Maribel\u2019s mouth went up in a gentle manner. \u201cMadam, you don\u2019t have to find a dead body. If I pay, I can get a similar kid anytime.\u201dSimone turned blue when Maribel said that she would kill a healthy child and turn her into a corpse. \u201cI\u2019m sure you said girls with blonde hair and green eyes were hard to get when you presented Anais\u2019 illegitimate child.\u201dDuke Kiellini was angry because he thought Maribel had hidden another way.\u201cThat\u2019s right, Your Excellency. Blonde hair and green eyes like that are hard to get unless they are born with noble bloodlines, even if it\u2019s half. And even if I could find a similar child as I could, I would not be able to let a prostitute play a noble princess named Kiellini as a substitute. What if there\u2019s an aristocrat who recognizes her?\u201dMaribel laughed as the Duke shut his mouth to her words.\u201cAnyway, that\u2019s where the money will solve everything. Even if I don\u2019t get a girl with high-purity blonde hair and green eyes, if it is a damaged body, they are going to be cheated.\u201d\u201cWhere is it?\u201d\u201cThere is a famous hedonistic area named \u2018Under the Wings of an Angel\u2019 in Lebatum. I\u2019ll go there myself.\u201d\u2014\u2014-Simone recalled the conversation at the time. The child, brought by Maribel, was supposed to be found dead near the theater. But since Prince Bertino was looking for a runaway maid, she was in need of another body.The Simone who was reluctant to harm a normal person until recently, was not here now. There was only progress for her own guaranteed future.\u201cI\u2019ve been looking for the right body, and you ask me to kill you. I can\u2019t help it. If I kill you, who the Prince is looking for, I won\u2019t have to dress up the body so much. All I can do is to get a new substitute.\u201dJulietta sat in front of Simone, her hands together and hiding her expression as much as possible.The woman was right. As long as she knew a great secret, they couldn\u2019t let her go.She would never get out of here until the position of Princess Kiellini was perfectly guaranteed after making the debut in society safely.\u2018No, even if everything is done perfectly, will they let me go?\u2019Julietta laughed at herself for mentioning to the Duke a contract.\u2018What good is such a piece of paper?\u2019She laughed somewhat at the thought that she was still using the modern way of thinking. It was because she really appreciated Simone, who had awakened her to her foolish ideas.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Viscountess Simone. I was so angry and excited for a while. But please don\u2019t touch my luggage. This is just a request. I\u2019m asking you to accept your colleague\u2019s request.\u201dSimone snorted at the mention of a colleague.\u201cColleague\u2026 Yeah, let\u2019s say so. You\u2019re right, we are in the same boat. I\u2019ll do as you say. Anyway, I didn\u2019t even care what was in your old bag in the first place. I just needed your maid\u2019s clothes in that bag to do something important.\u201d\u201cI wish you had asked me to bring it.\u201dSimone laughed at Julietta\u2019s soft words. \u201cI just asked her to bring me a bag to reduce your hassle, but I was surprised to see you making such a fuss.\u201dContrary to what she had said, she must have searched the bag before. So, she knew there was a maid\u2019s suit in the bag.\u201cMaribel said you were dressed up with a dark face and fat figure. I haven\u2019t seen it in person, so explain in detail what it looked like. That way, I\u2019ll prepare it for a similar girl as much as possible.\u201dJulietta hesitated for a moment before opening her mouth. She didn\u2019t want to cooperate with this wicked woman, but she couldn\u2019t sacrifice a girl.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to get a fat girl on purpose. I was caught in disguise by the Prince long ago.\u201d\u201cAre you saying that you were caught?\u201dWhen Simone\u2019s face turned hideous, Julietta waved her hand quickly. She could really die if she misunderstood her.\u201cNo, that\u2019s not true. He didn\u2019t notice my hair color, face or skin color. The Prince knows me as an ugly child with roughly-looking brick-colored hair and dark skin.\u201dAt Julietta\u2019s words, Simone\u2019s expression released, and she gestured to keep speaking.\u201cYou don\u2019t even need to get a dark-skinned girl. He knows that when I was a kid, I got sick and the color of my face and neck were changed, so it\u2019s enough to get just a girl with common skin color. Because I put on thick glasses, he doesn\u2019t even know exactly what color my eyes are. So, a girl with brown eyes mixed with green is fine, too.\u201dIn order to avoid killing an innocent girl as much as possible, Julietta explained diligently.The sight reassured Simone. She didn\u2019t seem to be a cruel character, at least for her own safety. Simone had been nervous about rushing her fences because of the substitute\u2019s greed, but became gentler after seeing Julietta and decided to set her at ease for the first time.\u201cOkay. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s hard enough to get a body with that much. But where can I get a body whose skin color is different from only the face and neck?\u201dJulietta quickly rummaged through her bag at Simone\u2019s words and pulled out her make-up tools.\u201cHere, you can apply this metum fruit juice here. I\u2019m so stuffy that I usually only apply one of these. If you mix this rubas wax with it, it won\u2019t be erased by sweat or water. Rubas wax is applied by actors so that their makeup won\u2019t be erased by the sweat from the lighting, so it won\u2019t fade unless they use gharan oil.\u201dSimone looked down for a moment at Julieta\u2019s dressing tools. She was a very clever child. After a moment of agonizing over whether the child\u2019s cleverness was good or bad for her future work, she gave Vera a nod.When Vera accepted her disguise tools and gown from Julietta, Simone, her forehead looking worn, said, \u201cYes, it is going to be much easier. Now get out. I know that if the prince stops the search, he will leave for Tilia right away.\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014The body, surrounded by a knight\u2019s cloak, was brought into the office.Killian who had been gazing at it with his blush eyes as one of the knights removed the cape as carefully as possible was silent for a while, but gave an order again, \u201cTake off the clothes.\u201d\u201cWell, Your Highness, I understand your feelings of distress, but I\u2019m sorry that she was dead like that, and please don\u2019t take off the clothes.\u201d Oswald had backed away and couldn\u2019t even look at the body. He promptly panicked and talked the Prince down off the ledge.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Julietta Iris Kiellini, Part VITranslator: KhanEditor: Aelryinth\u201cI feel different. The hair color, the lean chin line and the body shape are similar, but something is different. I don\u2019t know what it is, but I felt a sense of heterogeneity,\u201d Adam spoke up at Killian\u2019s answer.\u201cYour Highness, I know you don\u2019t want to believe it, but you were right. Didn\u2019t you say the maid was wearing a bigger suit than herself to hide herself? You were the only one who knew about her appearance,\u201d Adam continued, looking at a baggy suit soaked in water and wrapped in clothes like a sack.\u201cNo, my heart says that it\u2019s not Julietta. Of course, I don\u2019t want to believe what you said. I\u2019ll check it out carefully. Valerian, cover that knight\u2019s eyes. The rest of you, all turn around.\u201dValerian tied his cravat over the eyes of the knight who was pointed out, then turned around.The knight who had to strip the body with a blindfold was baffled. As he hesitated in embarrassment, he was ordered hastily, \u201cHurry up!\u201dKillian put the hands of the knight on the front button of the corpse. When he saw someone else\u2019s hands touching the maid\u2019s uniform that Julietta used to wear at ordinary times, he was suddenly uncomfortable and pushed the knight aside.\u201cStep back, I will do it.\u201d\u201cYour Highness!\u201dThe men who had turned around turned back to restrain Killian, but he was as firm as a rock.\u201cEverybody stay back. Are you going to make me say it twice?\u201dAlbert wailed to Killian who was horribly angry, and began to stop him, \u201cYour Majesty, please kill me. It\u2019s the sin of this old man who didn\u2019t know anything until Julietta disappeared.\u201dAs Albert was about to kneel down and even hit his head, Adam also knelt down toward Killian, who was sitting in front of the body. Your Highness, I\u2019ll call a maid. Just a moment, I\u2019ll be back in a hurry, so please stop touching the body.\u201dKillian looked around. Albert, his servant Ian, and the knight who had carried the body, as well as his close aides, were all kneeling, and they all looked pale.When Killian finally stood up, conflicted with the concern of those about him and his need to identify the body in a hurry, Adam hurriedly ordered the knight, \u201cBring anyone in as soon as possible.\u201dThe knight who was standing by the gate opened the door to the Oval Office and hurried out, and quickly brought in a maid as if he caught who was just passing by.When she saw the ugly body, she fell on her buttocks with a scream. Valerian\u2019s sword, angered by the way she dared to scream and show ugliness in front of Killian, pointed at the maid\u2019s neck.\u201cShut up and undress the body.\u201dAs she slid back sitting in surprise, the maid managed to remember where she was. Seeing the subjects and knights gazing fiercely at her, and the Prince with eyes fixed on the corpse, the maid came to her sense and crept towards the body.The maid began to strip the body without knowing why, shivering and sickened by the smell. Watching the scene, Killian began to burst into laughter when the clothes were completely stripped.\u201cHa ha ha ha ha!\u201dAt the sound of the crazy laughter, Adam turned around and hastily sent the knights and the maid out of the Oval Office.\u201cYour Highness.\u201d \u2018Was Julietta\u2019s death this shocking?\u2019 Albert did not know what to do when he saw Killian laughing like a madman.Killian stopped laughing, stared fiercely at the body and said. \u201cNo, no. It\u2019s not Julietta.\u201d At his words, all who had turned back turned around and finally looked down at the body.They looked down to see if there was anything to characterize, but they couldn\u2019t tell at all. They didn\u2019t know when he had ever seen her naked, but it was just amazing how he found out that she was not Julietta just by gazing on the pale bloated corpse.While looking at each other with curious faces, Killian regained his usual coolness.\u201cIs there anything in the body that could be characterized?\u201d When Adam asked carefully, Killian nodded.\u201cYes, there was something only I could recognize. It\u2019s not the first time I\u2019ve seen it, but I remember I\u2019d seen it before.\u201dKillian beckoned Valerian to take out the body.At Valerian\u2019s command, the knights outside entered and hurriedly wrapped the body in a cloak. Killian looked at it and ordered them, \u201cThat is the body of a girl who worked as my maid. Be formal and bury it in a sunny place.\u201dKillian wanted the body to be identified as Julietta\u2019s. It was to be handled by aides who knew his intentions.As the knights took out the body, Oswald, who had backed away to the far corner of the Oval Office, came back to the round table where Killian was sitting. Looking at Oswald who sat in a chair looking rather ill, Albert hurried to ventilate and prepare the tea. Adam frowned at the sight.\u201cYou hate the smell of blood, and you are afraid of dead bodies. How on earth did you learn swordsmanship?\u201d\u201cGracefully.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. I\u2019m sorry I asked you.\u201dOswald replied to Adam, who acted as if he had given up, \u201cNo, I\u2019ve seen people dead, too. But I\u2019ve never seen anything like that soaked in the water. I just have the soul of an artist who loves beauty and grace.\u201dLetting what Oswald said go through one ear and out the other ear, Adam glanced at Killian. \u201cYour Highness, what did you mean by what you said?\u201dLooking at Killian drinking tea with an expressionless face, Adam asked him what he was curious about. Despite Adam\u2019s question, Killian pretended not to hear and drank tea without responding.\u201cAre you sure it\u2019s not Julietta? You wanted to think so, didn\u2019t you?\u201dAt Adam\u2019s voice full of doubt, Killian took a glance at his close associates looking at him. He didn\u2019t mean to answer, but everyone was wondering so much they were about to die.\u201cThe body\u2019s figure was different. Even if it was swollen in the water, its waist was not as thin as Julietta\u2019s, and its legs were different in length, when I looked at the overall figure.\u201d\u2018And there was no spot which Julietta had\u2026\u2019\u201cThen what do you mean you\u2019ve seen it before?\u201d Oswald asked, but Killian only drank tea without a word again.At his unwillingness to tell, Adam gave up seeking an answer and asked a different question. \u201cWhy did you turn that body into Julietta\u2019s?\u201d\u201cSomeone\u2019s trying to hide Julietta, even if they had to fake a corpse. We don\u2019t know what they would do if we keep trying to find her. Stop the search for the time being, but try to strengthen the surveillance of the outer doors and borders under the pretext of the soon-to-be-held hunting competition.\u201d\u201cWho the Hell are they? It\u2019s too weird to relate Julietta to those who sent her to prison. It would be better for them if they killed Julietta like Lady Chaister.\u201dKillian nodded silently.It was certainly strange. It was clear that Julietta left the castle to reject his offer. She must have run away as soon as she refused Albert. She even took her bag with her.If Duke Kiellini\u2019s words were true, he could not help but think that something had happened to Julietta after getting out of the carriage in the city.\u2018Who is trying to hide Julietta? Why the hell?\u2019\u201cAlbert.\u201d\u201cYes, Your Highness?\u201d\u201cDid you say Spencer was the one who wrote the letter of introduction to Julietta?\u201d\u201cYes, Your Highness. She brought a letter of introduction from Marquis Rhodius, and Johnna, the head maid, employed her as a cleaning maid.\u201d\u201cValerian, send a man to the Eileen Theatre. Meet the actress, Lillian, and find out more about Julietta. You\u2019ll have to find out quietly, without anyone knowing.\u201d\u201cYes, Your Highness.\u201dAs soon as Valerian answered, Oswald stepped in. \u201cYour Highness, Lillian must be retired.\u201dAdam and Valerian looked at Oswald, wondering how he knew the whereabouts of an actress who was in Austern, as he stayed at Bertino, and quickly accepted it, seeing his appearance. Oswald who decorated himself as conservatively as possible to suit Killian\u2019s mood, and was still more colorful than anyone else in the office.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Julietta Iris Kiellini, Part VIITranslator: KhanEditor: Aelryinth\u201cThen where can I meet her?\u201d Valerian asked impatiently, having to carry out Killian\u2019s order no matter what.Oswald opened his eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t know that much. I\u2019m just telling you what I heard from Viscount Morton, who arrived yesterday.\u201dIt was Oswald\u2019s specialty, talking to the aristocrats and digging up information by reassuring them with light banter. Of course, social gossip, fashion, clothes, jewelry, art, and opera were things he loved, but he often caught more just in chatting than digging with such things in mind.Thanks to Oswald lightly making use of his hobbies and talents, Killian didn\u2019t need to waste his time sending a man to the Eileen Theater, and looked at him admirably.\u201cI\u2019ll have to ask when Spenser arrives. Did Duke Kiellini have any suspicious movements?\u201d\u201cYes, he hasn\u2019t been out of the main castle since his first day out,\u201d Adam reported. The movements of the Duke had no change.\u201cWhat\u2019s his relationship with Marquis Anais?\u201d\u201cHe didn\u2019t have any interactions, except to meet with him at dinner time and say hello.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t neglect surveillance on him, and thoroughly examine the surroundings of Duke Kiellini. I\u2019m afraid he\u2019s not come all the way to Bertino for my support.\u201dKillian could not ignore the sense of discomfort he had felt when he had his private meeting with Duke Kiellini that day. He didn\u2019t know what it was, but he had felt a certain strange feeling.\u201cIt\u2019s Lady Kiellini\u2019s debut year, so maybe it\u2019s to start a political background.\u201dAdam shook his head in Valerian\u2019s opinion. \u201cNo, it\u2019s time to hold his breath for the future of his daughter, who he won\u2019t hurt if he puts her in his eyes. No matter how likely His Highness is to be the next Emperor, the power of Prince Francis is incredible, and no one can guarantee the future of the political world. Even if he really decided to support His Highness for his daughter, he didn\u2019t have to come all the way to Bertino. Since His Highness is not staying here, if he goes back to Austern, it\u2019s enough for him to express his intentions.\u201d\u201cOr would he want to give her the highest seat in Austern, because she\u2019s his dear daughter? The seat of the Queen of Austern is higher than the one of the Duchess of Kiellini.\u201d Oswald mused, thinking of Lady Anais, who had come all the way to Bertino for Killian. The Duke might have thought that his daughter should get a higher position.\u201cNo, the Duke didn\u2019t like me showing interest in Princess Kiellini. So, I don\u2019t think he is looking for the seat of the next Empress.\u201d Killian said, recalling the Duke, who had hardened his face when he had been told about the Princess\u2019 debut.\u201d Anyway, don\u2019t reduce surveillance on Duke Kiellini, and search for the whereabouts of Julietta as quietly as you can. Prince Francis will arrive soon. I am not worried about Duke Martin, but it\u2019s not too pleasant being helped by Duke Kiellini because of the work of Lady Chaister, so it\u2019s not bad to have one weakness on him. I think his daughter is a weakness, so find out about her.\u201d******\u201cDid you get a girl?\u201d\u201cYes, ma\u2019am. Fortunately, there was a perfect girl.\u201dIn the middle of the night, Vera and the driver Gibson took a woman in her twenties to Simone\u2019s room. Simone closed her eyes for a moment, holding her trembling hands together, and then she opened themShe said she would look for the right body, but it was not easy to get a body with a similar appearance and age, as she made it. It was fortunate they found a plausible girl by scouring the slums like this.Simone looked at a girl, who put down her head in a dismal way. Now that she\u2019d decided to put her foot in it, she didn\u2019t know how much more sin she would make in the future. She had to check her sin with her own eyes ,instead of avoiding it.The girl might not eat well, and she had a leaner body, dry skin, and a rougher hair than a brick-red wig Julietta had.\u201cLift your face.\u201dThe girl raised her face at Simone\u2019s command. The frightened girl\u2019s eyes were gray-green, almost transparent. As the color of the eyes looking without focus were different from what she thought, Simone looked at Vera as she asked.\u201cThe color of her eyes changed as she became sick and lost her eyesight. It\u2019s a light color with little pigment left, but\u2026\u201dShe would be found dead, so other physical differences except hair color would be noticeable.To be blind in the slums was to be dead. A girl who couldn\u2019t make a living would have been a burden to her family. Simone turned her eyes from the girl and asked, \u201cWhat about her family?\u201d\u201cWe have brought them here. If we leave Bertino, we\u2019ll attach a man to help them to settle in the Kingdom of Halintz and pay them what we promised.\u201dThey put their daughter to death and would be quite well off for a lifetime. How could she blame the family for providing them with such an opportunity?\u201cTake her outside.\u201dAs planned, the body would be found in the river. It was a choice keeping in mind that the more the body was damaged, the less the differences between Julietta and her would be revealed.Vera grabbed the girl\u2019s arm and took her outside. Simone made up her mind by keeping her eyes on the back of the girl being dragged out.She had never imagined that she would plan and do this, even if it was for her niece and her future. She was the daughter of a high-ranking aristocrat. Although she had lost her husband early and had to spend her entire life in the countryside raising her young niece, she was a lady who had never seen anything so wrong before.However, Iris had to become the Duchess of Kiellini, and she herself had to retire as a powerful woman who had raised the Duchess of Kiellini. Simone bit her lips to the point of bleeding, thinking that she would not let anyone interfere with her plan.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-When the body was found, all the knights who had been searching for the missing maid withdrew. Because of the upcoming hunting competition, the security for the outer gates surrounding the capital was the same, but Simone thought it wouldn\u2019t matter if they weren\u2019t looking for Julietta.When they were finally ready to leave, Simone\u2019s party set out at lunch time, when the security of the gates was the most relaxed.\u201cViscountess Simone and her ward, Miss Lyla.\u201dThe driver Gibson held out the identity cards he had prepared to the knight, who was checking their identity at the guard\u2019s post. A knight came to the carriage, confirming two small bronze cards for women, and ones for a maid and a driver.\u201cMay I check inside for a moment?\u201d At the knight\u2019s words, Vera opened the carriage window.\u201cExcuse me. Since it\u2019s National Foundation Day and the hunting competition, we\u2019re thoroughly investigating every procession that goes to and from Ricaren to avoid danger.\u201dJose, one of the twenty elite knights who had followed Killian as an escort from Austern, looked carefully into the carriage, wondering if there was any sign of the familiar appearance of the maid. It was the job that Killian had secretly ordered them in the capital.Jose greeted them politely over the window, and looked inside with sharp eyes. In a plain little carriage with no emblem, which for a noble family which was not very large, there was a lady with silver hair, a young woman with a veil covering her face, clad in sables, and a maid.Jose took a close look at the appearance of the beautiful woman who looked back at him faintly over the veil in a dark carriage. She was the first woman to cover her face even though he had checked so many carriages so far. But her black hair and dazzling white skin under the veil were too far from the ugly maid he had seen. No matter how disguised she was, it could not be that different.At that time, a reproach came from the Viscountess, who was displeased with seeing him staring at an unmarried girl too much.\u201cIs there still more to check? There happened an unexpected event in Miss Lyla\u2019s family, and we are on our way back. Since it\u2019s a late departure and a long way to go, would you hurry up?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Julietta Iris Kiellini, Part VIIITranslator: KhanEditor: AelryinthJose withdrew, coughing in vain at the euphemism for \u201cstop staring!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry. There is no problem, so you can leave. But you\u2019re going home without a single escort?\u201dSimone frowned at the worrying attitude of the knight. \u201cThe escorts will soon follow. Thank you for your concern.\u201dJose stepped back without further ado at Simone\u2019s cold reply. \u201cI hope you get back safely. You may leave.\u201dWhen the window closed and the carriage finally started, Simone clicked her tongue.\u201cYou caught their eye before you could get out of Ricaren. Be careful not to let anyone see your face until you get to Tilia.\u201d\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d Julietta replied, carefully touching the veil on the hat, and arranged it again so that it wouldn\u2019t reveal her face.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-A month after leaving Ricaren, the capital of Bertino, the group was able to reach Tilia Territory.Julietta studied the dark gray castle and tried to calm her pounding heart. Now her new life would begin.Even though she was someone else\u2019s substitute, she was able to throw off her ugly disguise. Of course, she had to go back to \u201cJulietta\u201d after the substitute\u2019s mission, but she had never intended to just blow up the opportunity given to her. Without a doubt, she would take this opportunity as a stepping stone, and would live a new life away from Manny\u2019s curse.Simone looked at Julietta sitting opposite her. She felt that the girl, sitting there with a black veil hanging down, was uneasy.The harsh education had changed Julietta\u2019s attitude throughout the journey. She knew from the first that the girl had an excellent appearance, but now she was confident in her behavior and speech, and was beautiful beyond all description.Simone shook her head to erase her ominous thoughts. If the future of Iris was threatened even a little, her brother, the Duke, couldn\u2019t sit still. Also, she would not let anything go that would threaten her future, either.The party passed through the gate on a starless night. Julietta got off the carriage along the long driveway, and met the butler of Tilia Castle, who came to meet her.\u201cHave you been well?\u201dSimone nodded to the butler who had greeted her politely. \u201cWhat about Iris?\u201d\u201cShe is waiting.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s been okay, hasn\u2019t she?\u201d\u201cYes. Fortunately, she didn\u2019t get any worse. Yesterday, it was short, but she even took a walk. Hope for the future seems to be having a good effect on her health.\u201dSimone nodded at the butler\u2019s words.\u201cI\u2019ll go to Iris first, so get ready and follow me.\u201dThierry looked at Julietta who stood behind Simone, and said to Vera, \u201cI have the innermost room on the second floor ready.\u201d\u2014When Simone and the butler opened the door in the middle of the second floor and entered, Vera took her to the room inside. As soon as she entered the calm ivory-colored bedroom, Vera sat Julietta in front of the dressing table, took off her wig, and began to trim her hair.\u201cWhat about Lady Iris?\u201dWhen asked that by Julietta, Vera silently combed her hair. She looked like a woman of chubby frame, calm brown hair, slightly wrinkled eyes, from a loving and chatty neighborhood, but she was indeed silent. They had talked many times over the period of more than fifteen days to Tilia.Julietta gave up on hearing the answer and sighed slightly, then heard Vera\u2019s voice. \u201cShe is beautiful, clever, and gracious. If not for her health, she is perfect.\u201d\u2018I guess so. She was raised in a perfect environment, so I thought that she would not fall short. If the Duke of Kielini and the younger sister of Marquis Anais were her parents, she would be pretty, of course. If she really was healthy, she\u2019d have nothing to be envious of.\u2019Julietta had forgotten her situation and was sympathizing with the sick princess.\u201cDon\u2019t be an enemy. Don\u2019t be greedy for something that isn\u2019t yours. Don\u2019t forget your reality. That\u2019s all I can say to you.\u201dIt was sincere advice. It was fortunate that Vera did not antagonize her as much as Simone, who seemed to hate her. Recognizing her reality was what Julietta was most confident of.Julieta vowed that she would do her best the day she was free of this shackle and fly freely.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\u201cYou are pretty.\u201dThe girl sitting up against the white bed looked as fragile as a crumb. The pale blonde hair, pale face, and lightless purplish eyes were observing Julietta with an expressionless calm.\u201cAunt, do we look alike?\u201d Finally, Iris took her eyes off Julietta, looked at Simone, and asked, \u201cIt\u2019s half blood mixed, so it won\u2019t be different at all. Right?\u201d Without waiting for Simone\u2019s answer, Iris concluded.\u201cI\u2019m moving to a separate house tomorrow. No matter how much I hide, it\u2019s hard to hide my identity from the employees who come and go from the castle. Well, today could be our first and last meeting. In fact, we don\u2019t have a good reason to see each other often. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201dIris spoke with an impassioned expression as she looked at Julietta\u2019s bright blonde hair, sparkling green eyes, and red lips as if to prove she was alive. She did not say that it was nice to meet Julietta, even in empty words. She was just a girl who would take over her role. She was a girl who would go out of Tilia, instead of herself, and make a debut in society and experience everything. Iris would be a dead person until the girl returned to her seat, a dead person who no one should know existed.\u201cMy name is Iris Regina Kiellini. You are Julietta, right?\u201d\u201cYes, my lady.\u201dIris stared at Julietta quietly. \u201cFrom now on, your name is Iris Regina Kiellini. Please use it well and give it back.\u201dIris looked at Simone with a heartless eye. \u201cNow, aunt, please call me Regina. I don\u2019t like being confused with her, even for the time being.\u201d******\u201cSpencer, come on. Did you enjoy your trip?\u201dFor the hunting competition to be held next week, Prince Francis had arrived that morning in time, and Killian\u2019s cousin, Marquis Spencer Rhodius, had followed.\u201cI got the wrong start date. I don\u2019t feel good, because I\u2019ve been continuously bumping against Francis during the trip,\u201d Spencer complained as he swept through his pale brown hair, which covered his eyes slightly.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you move with him together?\u201dSpencer snorted at Killian\u2019s words. \u201cDo you want us to have stabbed each other? If I had a guarantee to win, I\u2019d have attacked him, pretending to be crazy.\u201dSpencer was not like Oswald, but he was of the same class. He loved art, praised beautiful women, and detested blood and force. He was able to live a life that had nothing to do with the struggle for the throne, but he came to the political dispute on the side of Killian; it was because of the Dudley family and Francis. The moment they came to power, he was afraid of what would happen to this peaceful Austern.Even now, there was no knowing how much of Dudley\u2019s funding was being used to stop Francis from acting. Francis must do what he wanted, whatever it would take; it was a secret known only to those who knew Francis\u2019s character.Francis was now suppressing himself to become Emperor, but if the reins were lifted after achieving the desired goal, what would happen? Spencer was worried about that. He could drive Austern into a time of blood. His blood was mixed with the royal blood, so Spencer himself did not know what kind of charges he would face if he was unlucky. It was natural that he hated Francis in this situation.\u201cWhat about Francis?\u201d asked Spencer who had arrived right after Francis, and thought Killian might be facing him, but he could not see him at all.\u201cI haven\u2019t seen him yet, either. I heard he dropped by the outer castle first.\u201d\u201cDid he go to where Lady Anais is? It looks like he\u2019s in a real hurry.\u201d\u201cHis behavior is quite reasonable since the marriage to Princess Haint has failed. Except for Princess Kiellini, who is now known to be dead sooner or later, the woman with the highest status among the ladies who are at the marriageable age is Lady Anais.\u201d\u201cIs Francis still believing that he must marry a woman of the highest status in Austern to become an Emperor?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Julietta Iris Kiellini, Part IXTranslator: KhanEditor: Aelryinth\u201cHe\u2019s completely convinced, even if it\u2019s a false prophecy or a curse from a pseudo fortune-teller. If it were me, the cousins in the family of Anais are on his side anyway, so I would marry a woman from another family and expand my power.\u201d\u201cIt was the fortune-teller who the Empress cared about. She predicted a lot of things, so that stupid prophecy could really be right. It\u2019s not something to be laughed at like that.\u201dKillian smiled aimlessly at Spencer\u2019s words. \u201cThe fortune-teller was said to be spiritual and received far better treatment than she was worthy of a few minor things. But it is obvious that she was a pseudo fortune-teller since she failed to stop the assassination of the Empress. If not, why couldn\u2019t she have predicted such a great incident?\u201dKillian used to talk consciously and lightly when talking about the past things. However, his impression was firm now, as opposed to his casual tone.As Spencer looked anxiously at him, Killian was thinking of the incident without realizing it.The annual summer hunt was held every May to celebrate National Foundation Day, which was for the independence of the Kingdom of Mycaeum after its contribution to the victory of the Great War four hundred years ago. It was the most important festival of the Principality of Bertino.Thirteen years ago, in that year, the Empress and the second Queen decided to participate in Bertino\u2019s summer festival, as they had attended every year.The Emperor was worried that they had to move overland because of the unrepaired Magic Square. Despite his repeated dissuasion, the Empress would not give up her chance to visit her hometown.It was a perfect trip, except that Irene, the second Queen who departed with them, got sick in the middle and went back. The excitement of Killian\u2019s first long carriage trip was especially great.It was a time to go through the final forest to pass through the border connected to Bertino, enjoying the beautiful May weather with such a giddy heart. There was a sudden attack by bandits.At first, everyone in the entourage laughed at the foolish bandits, as they attacked the party of the Empress of Austern. But the bandits numbered more than twice as many as the guards, and were as capable as the imperial knights. The escort knights began to be killed helplessly by those who could not be regarded as bandits.Empress Cordelia slightly opened the curtain of the carriage and looked outside, and said to Liana, the maid, \u201cLiana, I feel something weird. I need to hide Killian.\u201dThe backs of knights surrounding the Empress\u2019 carriage were visible, but the bandits in the black masks beyond them were quite powerful.Seeing the Empress lowering the curtain again, Liana hurriedly lifted the lid of the chair on the side where she had been sitting.\u201cYour Highness, I know you will be uncomfortable, but you\u2019ll have to go in for a while.\u201dKillian looked back at the Empress uneasily. Cordelia looked at the space under the chair for a moment and shook her head. \u201cNo, Liana. If they\u2019re the ones we think they are, they\u2019ll search the place first. They know Killian is also heading to Bertino together with me.\u201dCordelia picked up Killian, sitting next to her and put him on her lap.\u201cKillian, do you know how much I love you? I love you enough to do anything for you.\u201d Cordelia looked deeply into Killian\u2019s silver eyes.\u201cMe too, I love you so much!\u201d\u201cFrom now on, what I\u2019m asking you to do must be really hard for you, who was born a noble Prince. But Killian, whatever happens, you have to survive. You don\u2019t need all your pride when in danger of your life. The authority of the imperial family? The nobility? What\u2019s the use of all that if you die? So, no matter what happens, you must survive and do what you want to do. I don\u2019t need revenge. Don\u2019t waste your life on such a thing.\u201dCordelia patted Killian\u2019s soft black hair affectionately.\u201cIf you want to be Emperor, be Emperor. But if you don\u2019t want to be, don\u2019t be. But you have to make sure you know who your enemy is. You\u2019ll have to make sure your life is never threatened by anyone again. Can you promise me?\u201dUnlike the Empress\u2019 stern voice, Killian nodded silently to the mournful, tearful gaze.Cordelia hugged him firmly and released him at Killian\u2019s silent acceptance, then closed her eyes for a moment and prayed. Outside the carriage, there was still a loud crash of swords and screams.A moment later, Cordelia who opened her eyes rose from her seat and locked the carriage door, then fell to the floor facing the door.\u201cYour Majesty!\u201d\u201cAunt!\u201d\u201cShh, quiet. Killian, come here. Can you tell me what I want to hear for the last time?\u201dKillian hugged Cordelia\u2019s neck and whispered in her ear a word she\u2019d wanted to hear so much. A stream of tears trickled down from Cordelia\u2019s eyes at the whispered words.Sitting still for a while, savoring the words, she opened her eyes to the sound of the swords just by the carriage. Then she lifted her skirt, which was inflated with panniers.\u201cKillian, come in here. From now on, no matter what you hear, never make a sound or come out. All right?\u201dCordelia looked hard at Killian, who shook his head when he was told to hide in her skirt.\u201cKillian, don\u2019t forget what I said earlier. And build up your strength so that no one will force you to do anything you don\u2019t want to do after today.\u201dKillian, looking alternately at Cordelia\u2019s face and the uncovered dress, bit his lips tightly and crawled along the bottom of the carriage into the skirt.Cordelia led Killian, who sat still in the dress to lie on her lap. Liana approached, touched the dress so that the hidden Killian wouldn\u2019t be seen, and sat on the floor as if she were standing in the way of the Empress.\u201cLiana, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cNo. This is my destiny.\u201d\u201cDestiny\u2026 yes, I guess fate can\u2019t be changed anyway.\u201d\u201cBut if Prince Killian survives today, the efforts of the Empress will shine, and my death will be a very glorious one. So, Your Highness has to be safe.\u201dThe locked carriage door began to rattle as the two women waited for death.\u201cBreak it down.\u201dThe sound of a sword hitting the door was heard outside, and soon the luxurious carriage door was shattered and fell down. Cordelia\u2019s eyes caught the disastrous scene of the cruelty outside in a huge open space. She tasted the smell of blood, and had dry heaves without knowing it.Cordelia glared at a group of black-masked men, thinking of Killian hiding quietly in her dress.\u201cWho sent you? I know you are not just a group of bandits.\u201d\u201cAnyway, you will be dead. What would you do if you knew who sent us?\u201dWith a calm voice and cultivated tone, Cordelia felt somewhat relieved. At least they didn\u2019t seem to be ruffian mercenaries. She said, having a faint hope on their chivalry, \u201cI\u2019m going to die, but I want to know who at least kills me. But if I give up on this and don\u2019t ask who sent you, will my maid be spared?\u201d\u201cNo, we can\u2019t do that. It\u2019s an order not to let anyone live.\u201d\u201cThen why don\u2019t you tell me who is going to kill me?\u201dAt the calm Cordelia\u2019s words, the man who seemed to be the leader hesitated for a moment. Cordelia asked, as if to take advantage of his hesitation, \u201cDid the Duke of Dudley send you?\u201dCordelia nodded when she saw the brown eyes between the black masks flashing a positive reply.\u2013 Thank you. It\u2019s a relief not to die in the hands of a bunch of ravenous bandits. At least you won\u2019t touch my body.At Cordelia\u2019s words, the chief answered, \u201cThat won\u2019t happen, so rest assured.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good. I\u2019ll trust that promise and die without any resistance.\u201d The chief raised his sword as Cordelia closed her eyes in determination.\u201cWait, Sir Randolph. I don\u2019t see the Prince and the second Queen. Empress, where is Prince Killian?\u201dThat was how it turned out that the chief who had raised his sword against Cordelia was named Sir Randolph. Randolph looked at the Empress as if he had asked her at the cry of the man next to him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Julietta Iris Kiellini, Part XTranslator: KhanEditor: Aelryinth\u201cKillian and Irene were not feeling well along the way and went back to the Imperial Castle. I guess you haven\u2019t heard about them yet.\u201dAt Cordelia\u2019s answer, the man next to Randolph pushed Liana sitting in front of the Empress, and lifted the lid of the chair in the carriage to check the space containing the rubbish.\u201cObviously, they are not in the carriage. There\u2019s no room for the second Queen and the Prince to hide.\u201d The man next to Randolph said, and then immediately swept his sword Liana faster than anyone could react. Riana who was hit by the sword in a diagonal line from neck to stomach, was fluttering and vomiting blood. She didn\u2019t even have time to scream at what had happened.Even in such a state, Liana forced herself to turn around and hug the Empress.\u201cShe\u2019s a loyal maid. Empress, the last road will be not lonely. Many of these people will be your companions.\u201d\u201cSir Peterson, stop it. But she\u2019s the Empress of Austern. It\u2019s too rude.\u201d\u201cSir Randolph, you can\u2019t keep coming out like that. I tried to give you such a great chance to kill the Empress, but you can\u2019t. I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201dThe man called Peterson pointed a sword at the Empress, who stroked the hair of the dead Liana, who had fallen on her lap.They will never know why Liana died. While throwing up so much blood, she turned around and wrapped herself around my waist. They should never know why.A sword was placed in front of the Empress, who was looking down at the dead Liana.\u201cI am sorry that the second Queen and Prince Killian were sent off together. Goodbye, Empress.\u201dPeterson finished his remark and pierced his sword into the heart of the Empress. Cordelia fell down, wrapping around the kneeling Liana, and Killian, who was crouched under her.\u201cWithdraw.\u201dRandolph gave an order to his men when he saw Peterson, who confirmed that the breath of the Empress stopped, his hand touching her neck.\u201cWill you leave the bodies as they are?\u201dRandolph answered Peterson\u2019s question, \u201cIt\u2019s the last wish of the Empress, so I\u2019ll have to listen to it.\u201d\u201cWe can\u2019t leave the remnants of the Empress\u2019s body alone if we want to make it look like it was done by the bandits.\u201d\u201cJust take what you see.\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t we burn the wagon?\u201dRandolph shook his head in Peterson\u2019s question. \u201cThe body must be found to prove the death of the Empress.\u201d\u201cSo, the first Queen will be the Empress. Is Prince Francis finally going to be the Crown Prince? I\u2019m sorry that I couldn\u2019t kill the second Queen and Prince Killian.\u201dPeterson turned around and chattered after Sir Randolph climbed up on his horse.\u201cNow that the Empress is dead, Prince Killian\u2019s crown is out of line. The moment the first Queen becomes the Empress, Prince Francis will be the descendant from the legal lineage. No matter how much His Majesty wants Prince Killian to be the Crown Prince, it\u2019s all useless if he can\u2019t get through the congress.Their voices grew fainter and farther away.Killian had to endure the weight of death that kept him concealed for two days\u2026\u2014-\u201cHere it is! Here\u2019s the Empress\u2019s carriage!\u201dIn the hot early summer, all kinds of bugs were swarming around the bodies of knights already decayed.The chief of the Royal Guard, Louis Gabriel Valerian, had set out immediately at the Emperor\u2019s command, moaned without knowing himself as soon as he arrived near the Empress\u2019s carriage, which had turned red with knights\u2019 blood. The images of dead knights surrounding the carriage showed how desperate their resistance was.Count Louis Valerian crossed himself and stood in front of the carriage, its interior showing with door off. Inside the carriage was the body of the Empress, who was lying on her stomach, wrapped around a dead maid.\u201cDid you find the body of Prince Killian?Count Valerian nervously glanced around the body of the Empress and shouted, \u201cNot around the carriage!\u201dCount Valerian made an embarrassed look at the report of his subordinate.After the Empress\u2019 group did not show up at the border, a magic message was sent from the Imperial Castle in Austern. Claudio, the Emperor who had been anxious about Killian accompanying her, urgently sent a group of knights, led by Count Valerian, the Empress\u2019s cousin. As his premonition suggested, a pile of bodies was found in the woods leading to the border.Due to the broken Magic Square, the road to the border was lined with merchants and travelers, but this was a deserted road. It seemed that the Empress\u2019s band had the knights enter a path where people would not go, to avoid mountain animals and bandits. Or there was a possibility that someone had deliberately led them this way.Count Valerian, carefully examined the bodies after reciting the words of apology, thinking that the reason the two women fell down and died was to protect the Prince. They had barely moved away the rigid body of the maid, but the body of the Prince they had expected was not found.\u201cThey didn\u2019t kidnap His Highness, did they?\u201d one of the knights asked, rummaging through the bodies of the knights again.\u201cOnce, take care of the body of the Empress politely. I can\u2019t let her stay here,\u201d Louis ordered, looking sadly at Cordelia, his maternal cousin.The knights knelt in front of the Empress\u2019s body in courtesy, and carefully pulled the body out of the carriage.\u201cOh, my God, Your Excellency. Look here!\u201d The knight who was carefully lifting the body of the Empress exclaimed in surprise. Looking hastily into the carriage at his cry, Valerian found Killian crouching on the floor, unconscious.\u201cYour Highness, Killian\u2026\u201d Surprised, Louis hastened to hug the little Killian.\u201cThe Empress must have hidden His Highness in her dress. That\u2019s why she died lying on her stomach\u2026\u201dThe knight murmured, feeling sorry for that. Louis stared into the small face covered with tears and wrapped him in his cloak.\u201cThe first division will take the body of the Empress with me and return to the Imperial Castle first. I want the rest of you to collect the knights\u2019 bodies and come back.\u201dLouis rushed back to the village near the border, carrying the stunned Prince. After seizing the inn and hiding the Prince completely in case of a possible danger, he ordered knights to fetch a doctor.\u2014The young doctor who was dragged into the inn by the knights who had ridden in all of a sudden carefully examined the sleeping boy. \u201cHe just fell asleep. There\u2019s nothing wrong, so don\u2019t worry,\u201d the young doctor spoke, and watched Louis gasping for relief when he said nothing was wrong.\u201cI think you\u2019d better get out of town right away.\u201dLouie drew his sword with a nervous face at the significant words of the young doctor. \u201cDo you know anything?\u201dDr. Paulo grabbed his examination bag, pushing back the sharp sword hanging in front of his neck.\u201cNo matter how peaceful it is, but people living in the border towns have no choice but to be sensitive to changes in their surroundings. A few days before the Empress\u2019 procession passed, suspicious people began to enter the village. They haven\u2019t left town yet. I don\u2019t know the details, but if you don\u2019t want to get involved in dangerous things, you\u2019d better get out of town at dawn.\u201dAt the end of the remark, the young doctor left the room. He wanted to dig into the suspicious people who were left in the village, but as the doctor said, the first thing he had to do was to return to the Imperial Castle safely.Louis looked back at the sleeping Killian and ordered the knights standing guard outside the room to call in the deputy chief.Tamot, the deputy chief of the Imperial Guard, came into the room. \u201cDid you call me?\u201d\u201cSome suspicious people have been in town for a few days.\u201d\u201cSuspicious people? We\u2019ve looked into it all before, but nothing unusual.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s hard for us outsiders to distinguish between village people and non-towners. As soon as the Prince wakes up, I will take Henry and Vale and set out for the Imperial Castle immediately. You take the Empress and do the rest of the work and lead the rest of the men back.\u201d\u201cWon\u2019t it be dangerous?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Julietta Iris Kiellini, Part XITranslator: KhanEditor: Aelryinth\u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s only a day to get to the Magic Square in Baden Territory. On the contrary, the fewer people are moving, the less they will pay attention. It was early yesterday morning that we left the Imperial Castle after hearing that the Empress and His Highness\u2019s party had not arrived at the border, so those who stayed in the village will have found that Prince Killian had not returned to the Imperial Castle by now. So, I\u2019m going to get out of town right away.\u201dHe heard a rustle in the bed as Louis was explaining the plan like that. As Louis and Tamot hurried to the bedside, they could see Killian blinking his eyes as if he had come to his senses.\u201cYour Highness, are you awake?\u201d Louis called Killian carefully, who had finally come to his senses.Killian lay still, looking at the ceiling and walls of a strange inn. Count Valerian looking down at him, and closed his eyes again. Hiding in the Empress\u2019s dress, he felt cowardly and miserable even as a youth.Killian recalled the time of the nightmare. As the carriage door opened and the voices of the enemies were heard, the Empress asked for their identity, as if to teach him.Then Liana who fell over him, whispered in a small voice as she was dying, \u201cYour Highness, you\u2019ll be fine. This hard work will soon pass if you bear with it a little. It will be okay. It will be okay. It\u2019ll be over in a minute.\u201dLiana whispered in a very small voice that he would be all right, to placate Killian until she was out of breath. Killian fainted, unable to overcome the tension and fear, despite the very comforting voice which was barely audible to his ear.When he opened his eyes, everything was quiet. But Killian couldn\u2019t get out of the place, because he wasn\u2019t sure he was safe yet. The moment he got out of this safe darkness, a sharp sword seemed to approach him.Killian had to spend two days there, despite the smell of blood that stung his nose. Finally, he fainted again in hunger, thirst, and fear that he might never get out of there forever. But when he woke up, he saw the familiar Count of Valerian.Tears began to flow down silently from the eyes of the Prince. Louis hugged Killian without knowing himself, as he saw only tears came down without any word.\u201cYour Highness, it\u2019s all right now. It\u2019s okay, so stop crying.\u201d\u2014As soon as Killian stopped crying, the group left the village. In the middle of the ride, changing their tired horses, they arrived at the Baden Territory\u2019s Magic Square, and fortunately they were able to reach the capital city Dublin without much interruption.\u2014-Maybe it was because he had survived that way, but childhood had disappeared from Killian. The bright, childish-looking Prince\u2019s charming appearance suddenly disappeared, his expressionless face, his cold eyes, and the arrogant character with no forgiveness for challenging his authority took over.No matter how young he was, the shame for keeping his life and hiding in the Empress\u2019s skirts continued to plague Killian. He swore that he would never run into such a situation again.Killian thought the reason that he had been constantly threatened since birth, and that the Empress had died was that the people around him wanted to make him the Crown Prince. Since then, the boy had publicly stated that he had no intention of becoming a Crown Prince in order to avoid giving cause to those who wanted to kill him.However, his desire for revenge had not been extinguished. He had told the Emperor that it was also totally unacceptable for Francis of the family of Dudley, who had killed the Empress to become the Crown Prince. That was why the Crown Prince of Austern had been pushed out to date.Killian thought of the fortune teller\u2019s prophecy as Spencer said, chewing up his most troubled time.On the first anniversary of the Empress after she died, the prophecy arrived.The astrologer who had come to Austern with the Bertino sisters disappeared after the Empress died. People thought she disappeared, shocked by her failure to prevent the death of the Empress. But the fortune-teller reappeared on the first anniversary of the Empress.After praying for the Empress\u2019s happiness in the after world, she had a private meeting with the Emperor and revealed why she had returned to the Imperial Castle. The prophecy was about the next Emperor, and she said that the next Emperor would be the one who would marry a woman of Austern\u2019s highest rank.Killian snorted at the thought of what had happened at that time. If she was so spiritual, why did she fail to prevent and predict his aunt\u2019s death? He shrugged and laughed at it, thinking that it was all bullshit and superstition.He shook his head and turned his gaze out of the office, apparently trying to shake off memories of his troubled past. A blue sky was visible from the wide-open window. He was thinking of Julietta somewhere under the sky, and he heard Spencer say. \u201cAs soon as Count Valerian saw me, he asked me where he could go and see Lillian. What\u2019s wrong?\u201dKillian lowered his eyes as he looked up at the sky and looked at his cousin. \u201cA cat ran away, and I am wondering if Lillian knows where she is.\u201d\u201cWhat nonsense are you talking about! Do you mean the maid I wrote you a letter of introduction for?\u201d asked Spencer, who was quick to sense something.\u201cThat\u2019s right. I thought I\u2019d get a maid who\u2019s good at her job for a long time, but I think someone stole her,\u201d Killian answered, throwing a pencil at the table, breaking it. Spencer had a serious look when he saw the pencil rolling in two pieces.\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cA bloody war will begin over the throne. Externally, it\u2019s going to be a fight between you and Francis, but I don\u2019t know who else will get involved. Under such circumstances, you\u2019re wasting valuable manpower trying to find a maid who just ran away.\u201d\u201cNot to waste. I just asked Valerian to find out. I can save more time if you help.\u201dSpencer glanced at Killian for a moment, took a broken pencil, wrote something on the paper and handed it to Killian.\u201cWhat is this address? Harrods Street?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve got her sitting down, after she tried to go down to the countryside. It\u2019s close to Bertino mansion.\u201dKillian threw a crumpled piece of paper into Spencer\u2019s face when he smiled shamelessly, and gave an order to his waiting servant.\u201cBring me Count Valerian.\u201d******\u201cThe people who remain in the mansion will be moved to the annex, along with Iris, no Regina.\u201dWhen Julietta returned to her bedroom from Iris\u2019 room, Simone and Vera followed her a while later. She thought she could finally get some rest after a tiring trip where she had to pretend to be an unfamiliar noble lady, but they didn\u2019t seem to be willing to let her go.\u201cAll of the servants and maids, including all the cooks, are going to move to a separate house except for the butler and Vera. Iris shouldn\u2019t have any inconvenience.\u201dThe few remaining residents of the castle were loyal to the family of Kiellini from generation to generation. However, no matter how loyal they were, they could not reveal that someone else would dare take on the role of their little master.The residents in the mansion knew that they would move along with Regina, who was weak and serve her while she was at the annex, refreshing herself at the change of surroundings. When they returned to the mansion, there would be no sign of Julietta or the temporary workers.\u201cThe temporary workers will be dispatched from the Kiellini headquarters in the capital. They\u2019re going to go with you when you go up to the main house. It\u2019s an action to show them the life in Tilia to lull any suspicions that may arise, so be careful not to be found at fault. Vera will be in charge of being in attendance until we get you your own maid, but since you were a maid, I think you can do most of it alone. The maids of the headquarters in the family of Kiellini are those who have grown up dealing with many aristocrats in the main house. Make sure not to let them know who you are and be regarded with suspicion after doing clumsy things.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Julietta Iris Kiellini, Part XIITranslator: KhanEditor: AelryinthAfter speaking, Simone did not leave the room and added another word, \u201cStay in the room when the new workers arrive tomorrow. I\u2019ll let them know that your health is slowly improving ahead of your debut in the society, so be careful not to walk around as healthy as now.\u201dVera glanced at Julietta, who stood furtively in the middle of the room, and spoke quickly. \u201cI\u2019ll bring you the bedding later, so please wash yourself first.\u201dWhen the two women left the room and she was left alone, Julietta sighed and sat down on the bed. Having to keep standing even after arriving at the mansion after a long journey, she grumbled, rubbing her legs, which she could barely rest for an hour.\u201cThey are incredibly hostile to me. People like that will be more suspicious and wary if I tried to get closer, wouldn\u2019t they? All right, I\u2019ll play the princess in a very businesslike manner.\u201dJulietta jumped out of bed and began stretching. She could not move even her head during the long journey, pretending to be a noble lady, and her whole body was stiff, and her bones seemed to be squeaking.Growl\u2026 Julietta looked at her belly, which was making a loud noise. She was hungry because she ran to the castle after lunch.The nobility might not feel hungry if they starved for a meal, but those who moved without a rest while waiting on their feet should not starve together. She, who was hired as a substitute for the role of a princess, was in the same position as the workers, so it was too much to ask for food at this time.Julietta untied the pouch she had tied to her waist.The fifteen-inch crude brown pouch on the bed was a precious one, carrying a magic glass bottle of the noble Prince. Inside the brown purse was a set with the bag that had been made out of old throwaway clothes and left in Calen Castle, there were her thick glasses for disguise, the makeup tools returned by Vera, a cookie and two loaves of bread that she had packed at the last inn, along with the pajamas that the Prince had given her.She never let go of the lessons she had learned from what she had seen, heard, and experienced. After arriving at Calen Castle and having major trouble finding a dining room, she realized that when she went to a strange place, she would starve until she knew where to go. In particular, she often lost a meal until someone took care of her, and since she was a substitute for the princess, she didn\u2019t know what else would happen.Today, after the last lunch before departing for Tilia Castle, Julietta said she would take a short walk before leaving and went down to the inn kitchen to buy two bundles of cookies and bread with her emergency funds, like they were a thousand pieces of gold. And now, looking at the bread and cookies that she had bought then, she praised herself wildly. All the experiences were baked into her now.Julietta took a cookie and a loaf of bread out of the envelope and ate them in no time. Just as she drank from the water jug lying next to the bed, feeling full, she belched satisfactorily and removed the crumbs that had fallen on the bed.She tied her pouch closed and stashed it in a drawer by the bedside, before going into the bathroom, holding the pajamas given by the Prince.This was also the castle of a high-ranking aristocrat. Magic was used in the water system, like the Prince\u2019s mansion.Having washed herself and feeling refreshed, she returned to the bedroom, and at the very moment, Vera came in with a sheet and a pillow.\u201cIs the Marquise sleeping?\u201dIt was clear that she was serving the Marquise first rather than bringing her bedding, so she asked her, and Vera nodded.Looking silently at Vera as she turned around after making the bed, Julietta thought she and Gibson would have had nothing to eat after lunch. Julietta sighed at the feeling of the bread that was hanging in her stomach, even though she had decided to act in a businesslike manner without personal interaction.Julietta opened the drawer, took the leftover bread and cookies out of her pocket, and called Vera, who was leaving the room.\u201cVera, take this.\u201dVera looked down at the paper bag which Julietta held out, and looked at her. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t eat dinner. Unlike the Marquise, we\u2019re not people of status who can eat anytime, even if we are hungry. Well, I don\u2019t know if Vera can eat when you want, but in today\u2019s atmosphere, it\u2019s not going to be easy.\u201dVera received the envelope as she looked for a moment at the girl whose damp hair was hanging down and replied, \u201cThank you\u2026\u201d\u201cI think it will take away your hunger. It may not be enough, but if you can, give some to Gibson.\u201dAfter speaking, Julietta wrapped her head in a towel and crawled into bed as if she were tired. Vera, looking at her, hesitated a little and handed her a word, \u201cYou have to sleep after drying your hair, to avoid catching a cold.\u201dVera quickly left to escape the gaze of Julietta, who looked after her in surprise.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-She took the advice of Vera, and raised her troublesome body to go dry her hair with a towel. Due to that, Julietta was able to wake up and open her eyes the next day, feeling much better. She sprang out of bed when she saw the sun pouring in through the large window that occupied one wall.As she hated to hear the nagging, Julietta quickly washed, came out, and opened the window, defying the annoyance. As she stepped onto the terrace, she could see a wide garden at a glance, a green garden in the blue sky, and hear the chirping birdsong. It was such a beautiful morning.Julietta stretched briskly against the backdrop of the blue sky, and looked down at the carriages lined up along the driveway with excited eyes.\u201cWhat are you doing!\u201dA refreshing and pleasant morning lasted but a moment, and Simone\u2019s high-pitched voice brought Julietta back to reality.She couldn\u2019t help but sleep in the sackcloth-like pajamas that the Prince had given her as a gift, because they didn\u2019t give her the suitcase with the clothes she had worn on her trip. On top of that, Simone\u2019s face became colder as she watched her braided hair stand on one side and her unmade face.\u201cThe daughter of the Duke of Kiellini has been showing up on the terrace this morning with such an ugly look! Are you out of your mind?\u201dVera hurried up to the room at Simone\u2019s fierce shout, pulled Julietta into the room, and closed the window.\u201cIris has been a sickly child since she was a child. She can\u2019t get up and get around at this time with such a colorful face. I will say that her health has slowly improved, but not yet. If you\u2019re not going to lie down on your bed, at least try not to leave the room.\u201dSimone stared at Julietta for a moment as she laid down quietly in her bed under the guidance of Vera, and kept speaking.\u201cRegina will move to a separate house in the morning. Regina\u2019s room so far was once the Duchess\u2019. It was the home of the hostess. You can\u2019t stay there, but this room is too small for the lady of the family of the Duke, so you can move to the third-floor bedroom as soon as it\u2019s ready. You are healthier than anyone, so you can go up and down without difficulty.\u201d\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201dEvery word the woman said really got on her nerves, but Julietta answered quietly. Simone\u2019s face hardened at Julietta\u2019s answer, as if she didn\u2019t like it. \u201cCall me aunt.\u201dShe looked back at Vera after repeating that reluctantly.\u201cShe\u2019ll have to wear the dress we prepared in Bertino until we go to Dublin. It\u2019s hard to order clothes from Madame Louai\u2019s, as her body shape is different from Regina\u2019s.\u201dSimone looked at Julietta in displeasure, as she was unnecessarily well-developed, unlike her niece, and continued to give instructions. \u201cFor the time being, do not order new clothes for Regina and try to find another designer. It would be nice to look for one on the side of the Vicern.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Francis, Part ITranslator: KhanEditor: Aelryinth\u201cI wonder if she\u2019ll accept that.\u201dIris was a lady who had grown up surrounded by the best from birth. She didn\u2019t like the clothes of the other designer in the Vicern who was considered a step down in fashion, preferring the clothes of Madam Louai, who was now famous for being the best local designer.Simone replied coolly to Vera\u2019s concern, \u201cIt started because she wanted it to. She will have to bear this much.\u201dVera looked at her master with a slightly startled look.Her master had little affection, so she was even mean to Vera, who had taken care of her for a long time. Still, she thought her master was pouring all her affection and attention on her niece, Miss Regina, but these days Simone\u2019s behavior had become increasingly questionable.\u2018Was there any change in her mind yesterday, when she saw her niece for the first time in two months? Or is she blaming the girl for causing this?\u2019Vera looked carefully at her master and turned at the new lady, who had already had a bored look while sitting on her bed.She compared the original lady Iris, who thought it was only natural for anyone to die for her sake, and the new girl Julietta who had explained her appearance in disguise for fear that someone who she had never known would be killed because of her, and shook her head.She was just a maid who did what she was told to do from above. She didn\u2019t need personal feelings. Vera closed her mind again, lowered her gaze, and engraved Simone\u2019s continued orders in her thoughts.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-6. FrancisFrancis looked out of the carriage window at the castle of Calen with an unpleasant expression on his face.\u201cThe stupid little bitch.\u201d He had been deeply offended by Christine, who had followed Killian all the way to Bertino to meet him.\u201cAnyway, you should take a look at Bertino once. Think of it as a preview of the treasure trove that will one day be your land.\u201d Marquis Marius put down the document that he was holding to his side, taking off his eyeglasses.\u201cThe problem is that the stupid bitch is completely besotted with Killian.\u201d\u201cThen, you\u2019ve come all the way here. Show your fear to the lady who doesn\u2019t know what the world is like.\u201d\u201cWhy did the Duke of Kiellini come to Bertino? Is he going to support Killian?\u201d\u201cThe succession is uneasy for the Duke. He needs more control of his own family. Viscount Raven is already acting like the next Duke of Kiellini.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the Duke of Kielini, who has the wealth equal to Killian. Moreover, even if he steps down, he was the former head of the administration and the second in protocol. It\u2019s a good thing if he steps back now, but if he takes sides with Killian, it will be hard for us.\u201dThe mother of the current Emperor Claudio was from the family of Kiellini. If the Duke of Kiellini, the Emperor\u2019s cousin and former Empress\u2019s maternal family, supported Killian, the already tilted Emperor would lean even harder.\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t want to intervene in a dangerous war on the imperial throne, even for his sick daughter. There\u2019s a rumor that she will be dead sooner or later. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d\u201cIf Kiellini shows any signs of backing Killian, send someone to Tilia. It\u2019s a problem if a girl who can\u2019t behave as a normal person dies. I don\u2019t want to have a scarecrow who can\u2019t have a baby as a Princess. Maybe it\u2019s better to kill Iris and make Viscount Raven the Duke.\u201d\u201cEven it is easy to kill the lady, it\u2019s hard to deal with the Duke. Even if Mr. Raven is appointed as the successor, it is only after the Duke dies that he receives the title. It\u2019s a situation where we don\u2019t know the time, and it could be counterproductive. If doubts are raised over the sudden death of the princess, the Duke\u2019s blade will be headed this way, as well as the possibility that Viscount Raven will be stripped of his position as successor. I\u2019d rather find a way to reconcile with the Duke.\u201d\u201cWill I just marry a Kiellini girl?\u201dAt Francis\u2019 s sarcasm, Marquis Marius spoke seriously, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a bad idea. Don\u2019t you care about the prophecy that the fortune-teller talked about thirteen years ago, anyway?\u201d\u201cAre you kidding me? You want me to be the nurse of a girl who is sick and won\u2019t die? And remember the old woman\u2019s other prophecy. This is something that even the Emperor doesn\u2019t know.\u201d\u2014Twelve years ago, the Duke of Dudley had brought in the fortune-teller who had appeared on the anniversary of the late Empress, had a private meeting with the Emperor, and left the Imperial Castle. He asked what she had said to the Emperor, but she would not open her mouth, and he had tortured her and learned that there were two prophecies.\u201cThe next Empress will be the lady of the highest rank in Austern. And the second prophecy is that the Prince of the birth of the right lineage will be the Emperor.\u201d The old woman had added after for a moment, \u201cThe second prophecy is the one I did not tell the Emperor.\u201d\u201cWhy? Why are you telling me about a prophecy that you haven\u2019t told His Majesty?\u201d Duke Dudley squinted suspiciously.\u201cThe second prophecy wasn\u2019t clear. That\u2019s what prophecy is. It\u2019s not exactly about showing it, it\u2019s about following people\u2019s conversations or similar in another medium. In the second prophecy, I only heard the words of those who rejoiced over the rise of the right descendant of the legal lineage after a long time. I couldn\u2019t give the Emperor an inaccurate prophecy.\u201d\u201cWhy did you tell me?\u201d\u201cThere is only one reason for an astrologer to say an incorrect prophecy. It\u2019s when I want to create chaos with this prophecy!\u201dDuke Dudley burst into laughter, wondering if the old fortune-teller had gone crazy from torture.\u201cThere is nothing to be confused by your prophecy. If the first prophecy isn\u2019t correct, then so is it, but on the second prophecy, the current Emperor has no descendant from his first wife, so it\u2019s a prophecy of the next generation.\u201d\u201cI suppose so.\u201d\u201cWhat matters whether the legal descendant becomes the Emperor or the son of the concubine becomes the Emperor. They are all the sons of the Emperor anyway.\u201dIt was important that Francis become Emperor, and he could not afford to wait until the next generation.The old woman smiled meaningfully at the Duke who snorted as if he were not interested.The old woman, a native of Bertino, was the Empire\u2019s best fortune-teller. Her relationship was not revealed to the public, but she was a woman who served only the family of Bertino.One day eight years ago, the Emperor saved the Empress from an assassin because of the old woman\u2019s prophecy. She was on the last month of her pregnancy, and was unable to conceive a baby after that, but the Emperor, who loved the Empress dearly, did not care at all.The old woman lost her foresight by engaging in someone\u2019s fate, but she was able to stay in the Imperial Castle after being credited with saving the life of the Empress. Duke Dudley had noticed that the old woman had disappeared after the death of the Empress, and then reappeared and met the Emperor.He thought that the old woman who had disappeared so suddenly had visited the Emperor because she had something important to say, and he had guessed right.The Duke of Dudley tried to detain the old woman in a remote area in order to use her visionary powers. But the old woman disappeared in the middle of the journey, and so far they had not been able to find out where she was.\u2014While Francis recalled the prophecy he had heard as a child from Duke Dudley, Marquis Marius nodded and continued to speak, \u201cIt\u2019s a way to get to the family of Kiellini, but we don\u2019t have a choice, because she can\u2019t produce an heir.\u201dFrancis stared at Marquis Marius, who spoke emotionlessly, as if he were picking up things from the market.\u201cAre you sure she can\u2019t get pregnant? If it\u2019s the wrong information, it\u2019s completely futile to come all the way to Bertino to meet Christine and put any efforts into Princess Haint.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Francis, Part IITranslator: KhanEditor: Aelryinth\u201cThis is what the princess\u2019s doctor said. He said she would never have sex. It would shorten her life. Also, pregnancy is not possible, even if she has an intercourse. Although I heard this three months ago, I don\u2019t think there would have been much change in the meantime.\u201d\u201cBut why did the Duke kill the doctor? He barely told us about the health of the princess. However, it wouldn\u2019t be too much of a problem. It troubles my mind.\u201dMarius nodded at Francis\u2019 doubts.\u201cYou\u2019ve improved a lot. I\u2019m glad my education seems to be getting more effective. You always have to be constantly suspicious. Your suspicious attitude at everything will make you Emperor.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re on your way to being prime minister.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, Your Highness. To answer your reasonable doubts, I\u2019ll have to re-examine the condition of Duke Kiellini and his daughter.\u201d\u201cI can bear everything but can\u2019t stand her lying down on the bed. If something is different from what we know about the state of the princess, you will have to kill her right away. If it\u2019s a matter about a lady with the highest status in the Empire, we can use it.\u201dWhen Francis gave an order, Marquis Marius nodded as if he understood that and replied,\u201cIf you like Lady Anais, I will make her the highest status in the Empire once we have dealt with Prince Haint easily.\u201dFrancis made fun of Marius\u2019 words. \u201cThe Marquis, it was your teaching not to fall in love with a woman. Do you think I\u2019m going to do this kind of a chore just because of a woman I like? Of course Christine is attractive. But the reason I chose Christine is that her true character is quite right for me.\u201d\u201cI see. Everything is as Your Highness wishes\u2026\u201dMarius lowered his head for a moment, paid homage to Francis, and then opened his mouth again. \u201cYour Highness, go straight to Lady Anais. I\u2019ll go to His Highness Killian and say hello to him.\u201dFrancis smiled, feeling better at the respect of his closest aide and mentor. \u201cYes. To celebrate my younger brother\u2019s hunting competition, I came running the long way here myself, and I think it should be his duty to come first and thank me for coming to visit him. Tell Killian we\u2019ll have a drink between brothers after a long time. Because of an urgent message from my maternal grandfather, Duke Dudley, I\u2019m going to meet Marquis Anais first, and I\u2019ll see him in an hour.\u201dFrancis unilaterally set the time, gave a satisfied look, and ordered the carriage to be turned.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Marquis Anais and Christine, who had been waiting for Francis to enter Rezen Castle, courteously welcomed him.\u201cYour Highness, did you have any particular problems on your way?\u201d\u201cNo, and I am standing right in front of you,\u201d Francis replied, staring disapprovingly at the Marquis who had brought Christine to Bertino.Christine greeted Francis who was approaching her. \u201cWelcome, Your Highness.\u201d\u201cThe Marquis, I need to talk to Christine, will you step aside?\u201dFrancis said as he approached Christine, who was bowing slightly.\u201cYes, Your Highness.\u201dAs Marquis Anais stepped down, Francis grabbed the chin of Christine, who was lowering her head, and forced it up.\u201cAre you having fun?\u201d Christine said, barely smiling, to Francis, who looked intimidatingly down at her face, which was lifted as if it had been bent.\u201cIt\u2019s amazing, since it is a place I have visited for the first time.\u201d Francis sat down on the drawing-room sofa, releasing her face at Christine\u2019s demure answer. \u201cDid you meet Killian often, as you wished?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve seen him every time we had dinner.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve met a lot. If you met that much, it would be enough, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d Francis smiled softly at Christine who was still standing.\u201cAre you with Princess Haint?\u201dFrancis laughed at Christine\u2019s attempt to evade an answer.\u201cI guess you didn\u2019t hear the rumor because you were stuck in this small town. Right now, Princess Haint has turned Austern upside down.\u201dChristine looked up in surprise.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cPrincess Haint is pregnant by Count Derio.\u201d When Christine\u2019s face turned white at the startling remark, Francis went so far as to present a toothy smile.\u201cDo you know why I came here in a hurry? Christine, you\u2019re now the highest-ranking single lady in Austern. So it\u2019s not the time for you to lose your mind to Killian here, because you have to marry me.\u201dChristine shook her head at his way of saying \u2018You are mine\u2019, as if the best thing was to agree to him as he arranged toys like a child.\u201cHave you forgotten? I\u2019m not the highest-ranking single woman, Your Highness. How can I be the highest when there\u2019s Princess Kiellini?\u201dFrancis grinned at Christine\u2019s words. \u201cI know you don\u2019t want to marry me, but it is too much for you to put a walking corpse on me. No, is she even alive?\u201d Seeing Christine follow Marius to the same story, Francis burst into laughter, sounding as if he had heard the funniest story in the world.He had ordered an investigation into Duke Kiellini while suspicious, but his intention to weigh down Marquis Marius was included to some extent, so he didn\u2019t really think there would be any significant change in the health of the princess.Christine opened her mouth cautiously, studying Francis, who smiled leisurely at the thought. \u201cYou know that Duke Kiellini has come to Bertino, don\u2019t you?'\u201d\u201cYes. It looks like Duke Martin tried hard to attract Duke Kiellini, and then took him all the way to Bertino. However, there is no way that cold-blooded man will hastily intervene in the battle for the crown. But why is the story of Duke Kiellini coming out here?\u201d\u201cI heard there will be a debut party for Princess Kiellini this fall. I\u2019m sure that it came from Duke Kiellini himself. He said he\u2019s going to announce his successor after the debut party. So Princess Kiellini is not a living corpse at this moment, and I\u2019m not the first one in your order of brides.\u201dChristine\u2019s words raised Francis\u2019 back off the sofa.\u201cI heard she will be dead sooner or later, but will her debut party be so soon? He said they couldn\u2019t cure her with the holy power; was that a lie?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know if she has been cured by the holy power, or if she has not been that bad in health. But the Duke said he was happy to have the debut party safely because the princess\u2019s health has improved a lot.\u201d\u201cIf so\u2026\u201d Francis\u2019 eyes flashed. Three months ago, the doctor had said that she was so weak that she couldn\u2019t have sex. However, she was going to have a debut party\u2026\u2018Did the doctor deceive me? And did the Duke kill the doctor to hide it? Why? If it turns out to be healthy, did he think Viscount Raven would do anything?\u2019Christine nodded at Francis, who was busy calculating at the new information. \u201cYes. If you marry Princess Kiellini, you will be able to bring over the family of Kiellini.\u201dFrancis leaned back on the sofa again, frowning. \u201cDo you think Duke Kiellini will give me his daughter? He hates being associated with the royal family more than anyone else.\u201dChristine laughed at his words, as if not to worry. \u201cShe\u2019s a woman who\u2019s been sick without a friend her age in the Territory. Unlike other aristocratic ladies, she has never had a relationship with others since childhood. No matter how great the family of Kiellini is, the social world isn\u2019t that easy.\u201dFrancis looked at Christine telling her silently to go on.\u201cIf she just made her debut in the social world, but if she doesn\u2019t know anyone, how lonely will she feel? That\u2019s when I will come up first to be her friend. Then I will introduce Your Highness to her. If a handsome man like you treats a lonely and hungry woman well, she will probably fall in love with you. If his daughter is in love with you and is willing to marry you, the Duke will not object since his love for his daughter is great. No, he will do his best to give you the crown, let alone the opposite. It\u2019s about making his daughter the Empress.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Why would you cooperate?\u201d\u201cTo save His Highness Killian.\u201dFrancis smiled cruelly. \u201cYou cooperate with me, and I spare Killian\u2019s life\u2026\u201d\u201cYes. If you will spare him, we will come to Bertino and live a life of peace without going to Austern forever. He\u2019ll never covet the seat of Your Highness. If you\u2019re nervous, you can maim him anywhere.\u201d\u201cDo you want him, even if he\u2019s maimed?\u201dChristine replied to Francis\u2019s cold words, \u201cIf I can\u2019t have him in a normal state, I should have him in that condition.\u201dFrancis clicked his tongue at Christine, who was still smiling.\u201cI feel sorry for you. I thought your character would fit me very well.\u201dChristine bowed her head gently to Francis\u2019 unassuming praise. \u2018There\u2019s a saying, geminiphobia, fear of those like yourself. You and I will never get into the same boat.\u2019\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-By the time Simone was heading to Bertino to pick up his niece\u2019s substitute, Maribel was going to Lebatum to prepare the body to deceive Marquise Anais.Because she had to personally act for a long time and it was something that had to be done in secret, she entrusted the deputy director with the theater\u2019s work for the time being, using the excuse of being ill in bed.She was worried about people whispering about her being gone for two months, the deputy director\u2019s moves, and the enticing of actresses away by rival theaters, but Maribel decided it was important enough to head directly to the Kingdom of Lebatum at all risks.Maribel was able to plan things out with her excellent head, quick judgment of the situation, her own eloquence, and her efforts alone.As a native of a small town in a tearfully poor northern kingdom, she came to Dublin, the capital of Austern, with a dream of becoming an actress. However, her singing skills and beauty, which had always been praised, were merely average compared to the countless aspiring actresses in the big city.Maribel didn\u2019t want to die doing chores at the theater one day in the hope of getting on stage, and quickly gave up on her dream. She managed to lure an elderly and rich lower aristocrat to get married and took over the Eileen Theater, which had been ruined, with the wealth she had received as her share after her husband was dead.For the next twenty years, she had made the Eileen Theater into the best theater in the continent, but still she was only Mrs. Grayson, a low-ranking aristocrat without a Territory. Then, an opportunity finally came to her, because of one child received by her instant compassion.Giving her virginity to an ugly old man with a stinking, rotting body for the future, Maribel had decided to close off all emotions and simply do it. The only person she had loved during her thirty-seven years was Julietta.Even if the affection was small to another man\u2019s eyes, it was the same as a mountain to the cold-hearted Maribel. Maribel headed directly to Lebatum for that affection, and for herself and Julietta\u2019s future.\u2014Maribel landed at a port in South Kingdom. Lebatum, and boarded a carriage to go to Rotesam, where \u201cUnder the Wings of Angels\u201d was located in the amusement sector.At the words of Maribel, who was looking for a miserable street that was incomparably worse than other kingdoms, a young man sitting in front of her replied bitterly, \u201cThe boozing, womanizing, and gambling of the king are getting worse and worse, and the aftermath is coming out on the street.\u201d\u201cHave you had any sudden compassion?\u201d Maribel smiled at a man with an unpleasant face all the way to Lebatum. \u201cRaphael, you know how hard it is to get my affection and sympathy. Yes, talking about the King of Lebatum reminds me of your father. Is Count Caden healthy?\u201dRaphael looked out the window again and replied, \u201cHe still has young girls in good spirits, like the King of Lebatum.\u201d\u201cHe hasn\u2019t been to the theater lately; he must have found another place.\u201d\u201cHe must have been embarrassed to keep asking my maternal grandmother to get a woman.\u201dMaribel laughed at the words \u2018maternal grandmother\u2019 he said uncomfortably.\u201cI\u2019m glad the child who wants to hide the relationship with me most calls me that.\u201dWhen her old husband died soon after she was married, there was only Maribel and one old stepdaughter left in the mansion, who was shy and fond of only books. Maribel, who was only seventeen, and her stepdaughter, who was twenty-five, were not as interested in each other and never bumped into one another.While the two never met face to face, Maribel took over the Eileen Theater and moved to the theater, and had no interaction with her stepdaughter for several years.Then one day, a maid of her stepdaughter came to see Maribel. The request was to help her prepare for the wedding, because she was pregnant.She wondered when and where the girl met a man and became pregnant, but that was all. She sent her stepdaughter\u2019s maid back under the pretext of being busy, and she didn\u2019t want to get involved, but she couldn\u2019t ignore it.\u2014-A few days later, Maribel reluctantly went to the mansion to prepare for her older stepdaughter\u2019s wedding, and saw her stepdaughter who cried and had a swollen face, let alone preparing for the wedding. When she pressed her to ask how she got pregnant, she said that she went to the library and became intimate with a lady. Then she went to a party at the invitation of a close lady, and she met Count Caden there and fell to his temptation and had sex.The stepdaughter, who had firmly believed she would marry him, told Count Caden the good news upon her pregnancy, but the answer returned was that he could not marry the lower noblewoman.Maribel calculated the impact of her stepdaughter\u2019s pregnancy on her. There was no way she could marry another man with a child, and she couldn\u2019t stay still when she thought she might have to take on her and her child all her life.By then, Maribel was working to connect actresses with high-ranking aristocrats to further grow the barely settled theater. Through such acquaintances, she was able to urge Count Caden to marry her stepdaughter, and even though he was not a high-ranking aristocrat, she could now reach the long-established family of the Count\u2019s as in-laws.There was only one thing she had asked for from her stepdaughter, who was grateful for it. If the child she gave birth to was a son, let her meet him twice a year.Of course, it was not from the affection for the child that she asked for such a condition. What kind of affection did she have for a child who did not have a single drop of her blood? It was because she calculated that there would be no harm in getting close to the future Count Caden who was entangled in her family register.Maribel realized that it was time to harvest the crop that had been waiting for twenty years.\u201cDon\u2019t you wonder why I brought you here?\u201d\u201cWell, how can I know your deeper meaning?\u201d\u201cThe place we are to visit today is a very secret place known only to high-ranking aristocrats through some acquaintances. It\u2019s a place where not just anyone can get in or out. I\u2019m visiting for the first time, too, and I brought you here because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s bad if you know.\u201d\u201cYou mean I might have to visit here again?\u201d\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know that. But maybe someday you\u2019ll need it, won\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cDoes it have to do with me going to Tilia Territory?\u201dMaribel laughed at Raphael\u2019s sharp question. \u201cIt\u2019s time for us to move up from a common noble family and emerge as a high-ranking nobleman. Of course, not now, but it will be after you become Count Caden.\u201d\u201cWhat are you up to?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll tell you later. It\u2019s not the time yet.\u201dMaribel thought about what would happen after Duke Kiellini made Julietta a substitute.It might be a few months before Julietta acted as Princess Kiellini. The Duke was expected to force Julietta to go back down to Tilia Territory once she settled down in a proper place in society and solidified her position as heir. That way, he could get his daughter\u2019s seat back.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Francis, Part IVTranslator: KhanEditor: AelryinthThe Duke who had such a great love for his daughter could never allow her to live as a shadow for life. If so, marriage was the only way for the ailing Lady to retain her title without making an appearance in society. He would show Julietta to society to let them know that she was healthy, and then he would find a suitable man and marry off Iris.Maribel thought Raphael was the right man to marry Iris. He looked pretty good, as he resembled the Count, who looked better than his mother, who had an ordinary appearance. It wouldn\u2019t be a bad thing for the Duke if Raphael captured the heart of Princess Kiellini.The carriage arrived at its destination, as Maribel was recalling her plans in satisfaction. The streets were lined with rows of buildings like high-end brothels. The two entered the entrance of the largest and most luxurious building, and found Sophie, as they had been instructed.Maribel pointed to a blonde-haired woman among those who had been maimed and quarantined for abuse by perverted aristocrats.\u201cI\u2019d like that person.\u201dSophie, the manager of \u2018The Fallen Angel,\u2019 one of the shops of \u201cUnder The Wings of Angels,\u201d beckoned the men to bring the woman Maribel pointed at.Raphae looked at those who sold even the sick in disgust, and frowned when he saw a girl who walked with tottering steps coming out. She seemed to be only fourteen years old or so.\u201cShe\u2019s very nice. Her hair color, her eye color, are not exactly the same, but they\u2019re very good.\u201dThe girl, unable to move by herself, was constantly groaning, as if her leg was in pain.\u201cShe must be sick. Did you not treat her at all?\u201d No matter how cold-hearted Maribel was, she had no choice but to say a word at the sound of the girl\u2019s illness. Sophie spoke blankly at Maribel\u2019s snubbing.\u201cThe owners of the brothels can\u2019t give doctors to women who can no longer accept guests. This girl is lucky to be able to get out of here like this. The rest of them can\u2019t get out of here until they die.\u201dRaphael cut in at Sophie\u2019s words.\u201cYou\u2019d rather let them go, because the cost of feeding them would be expensive?\u201d\u201cThere are some people who are looking for these sick women.\u201dIt was Maribel and him who he pointed to.\u201cSome people indulge in only corpses. Some people like the ones who don\u2019t have hands or have no eyes to see. Unfortunately, this girl hasn\u2019t been able to receive any guests since this happened. If she had been able to get a guest just once, she would have been given some painkillers to last a few days.\u201dMaribel frowned upon that remark.\u201cThat\u2019s enough. I see what you\u2019re trying to say. I have to go a long way, so I need you to call a doctor and calm the pain down.\u201dMaribel had heard about the Fallen Angel from the Duke of Miguel, the largest shop in the brothels of \u201cUnder The Wings of Angels.\u201d He used to be proud of the story, and that he had visited several times, saying, \u201cThere is no woman who cannot be got there.\u201dShe had used The Fallen Angel several times, connecting the women they wanted on behalf of the Duke or other nobles, but this was the first time she had visited in person.Seeing the women sitting there with dead fish eyes, she couldn\u2019t bear to think of herself in the past, when she was crushed under her husband and put up with the torment. As Maribel hurried out of the gloomy place, Raphael asked Sophie, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me; is this girl taking guests, too?\u201dHe seemed to be constantly thinking of the sick girl he was supporting.\u201cWhy not? The girl\u2019s appearance is not very good, so she doesn\u2019t have any visitors yet. Therefore, she is serving the sick people, but this is a brothel. Her fate is already fixed.\u201dThe child did not respond at all to Sophie and the guests\u2019 words, but merely kept her head lowered. A child who was born and grew up in the brothel area as the daughter of a prostitute, she was well aware of how to act.\u201cI\u2019ll take this kid with me, too. Don\u2019t stop me.\u201dMaribel shrugged at Raphael\u2019s aggressive attitude.\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to stop you. I just needed a proper kid, but it went well. I\u2019m taking her with you, too. Don\u2019t open your eyes that way. But she must be very expensive, since she is young and inexperienced. I\u2019d like to tell you to pay the bill yourself, but fortunately the person who sent me here is quite generous, so I think we can pay it together.\u201dMaribel looked at Sophie, after calming the aggressive Raphael.\u201cI just want one blonde here today. Even if the child is maimed, the combination of blonde and green eyes is very rare, and if you charge twice, I can\u2019t but help pay that, right?\u201dAfter hearing Maribel\u2019s words, Sophie nodded. \u201cYes, it\u2019s a very expensive combination.\u201dThey were directed to a reception room for the VIPs, while the blonde girl was treated so that she would not die until they returned to Austern. Maribel drank tea and looked at the brown-haired girl following them without a word.\u201cHow old are you?\u201d\u201d I\u2019m going to be seventeen soon.\u201dRaphael couldn\u2019t contain his sympathy as she looked so young, and asked back in surprise, \u201cSeventeen years old?\u201d\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re older than I thought.\u201dMaribel needed the right person to be her ear in Tilia. When Raphael entered Tilia Territory as a knight, she was going to send this child as his maid. She hesitated for a moment at the older age than she thought, but nodded soon after.\u201cWell, it doesn\u2019t matter. Do you know how lucky you are today?\u201dThe girl nodded at Maribel\u2019s question.\u201cI have saved your life from the brothel, where you were going to die of old age or sickness, so you have to pay me back for this grace, right?\u201dMaribel looked at the girl with an emphasis on her specialty, \u2018I save you, and you pay me back for it.\u2019 Maribel smiled satisfactorily as the girl nodded slightly more than before at her words.\u201cYou have a sense of duty. I\u2019ll let you know what you\u2019re going to do in the future. What\u2019s your name?\u201d\u201cDian.\u201d\u201cYes, for now all you have to do is wait on that blonde child to come back to Austern. I\u2019ll let you know slowly on the way about what to do after that.\u201dMaribel lowered the cup she was holding on the table, gazing cheerfully at the girl who nodded back gently.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\u201cTell me the current Emperor\u2019s name and imperial family tree.\u201d\u201cIt is Claudio Martino Julius Kiellini Austern, and the Empress is Cordelia Lauren Harriott Bertino Austern, the first princess of the Principality of Bertino, who was killed by bandits during her journey to attend Bertino\u2019s Founding Festival thirteen years ago. The first Queen is Victoria Lauren Diannel Dudley Austern, who is the mother of the first Prince, Francis Raymond Judell Dudley Austern. The second Queen is Irene Elizabeth Bertino Austern, who is the mother of the fifth Prince, Killian Mikael Hedford Bertino Austern. Hoo, why are the names so long?\u201dAs Julietta grumbled about the names of the royal family members, Simone stared.\u201cAnd again. Why do you attach those useless words? The direct royal family members put their maternal family names separately just before their last name to announce which family they are from.\u201dSimone was quite a good teacher. Her tough, cold personality remained the same, but she had never let herself yield when it came to Julietta\u2019s speech. As she always told her why, Julietta was able to learn and understand quickly.\u201cThen, is Kiellini attached to the family name of the Emperor His Majesty because it is his maternal family?\u201dWhen Julietta asked, Simone nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s right. At one time, the relationship between His Majesty and my brother was very strong.\u201d\u201cYou mean not now?\u201d\u201cThirteen years ago, there was an Emperor\u2019s order to find out who was behind the death of the Empress. I don\u2019t know well, but I think he was convinced that the family of Duke Dudley was behind it. But there was no evidence. His Majesty asked my brother to find evidence that the family of Dudley was behind it, even if he pressured them.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Francis, Part VTranslator: KhanEditor: Aelryinth\u201cDid he refuse?\u201d\u201cYes. My brother thought that no matter how much the Duke of Dudley was really behind it, he should not forge evidence against a great aristocrat. Because of it, the relationship between the two has become a little estranged. The crucial reason is that he made a direct statement to the Emperor that Prince Killian was not the right man for the Emperor\u2019s seat.\u201d\u201cWhy did he think so?\u201dJulietta thought of Killian and tilted her head, not understanding why the Duke had thought so. Although the Prince was arrogant, he was smart and fair, and listened to his subordinates\u2019 opinions. It seemed that he was already ruling Bertino successfully, so she couldn\u2019t understand why the Duke of Kiellini had opposed him.\u201cAfter Her Majesty\u2019s death, Prince Killian had a very difficult time. The Prince at the time looked so risky. At that time, the Duke of Dudley tried to make Prince Francis the Crown Prince. When he backed Dudley\u2019s hand, His Majesty\u2019s disappointment and anger were indescribable. But now I think he\u2019s changed his mind. He decided to support His Highness Killian.\u201dSimone went so far and asked the question again, \u201cCome on, then, tell me the five ducal families and the ten marquis families.\u201dAs if the break was over, Simone began to push Julietta again.\u2014When she finished memorizing the genealogy of the noble family, Simone handed Julietta the thick book that lay in front of her.\u201cThis book contains the history of the Renaid continent. Starting tomorrow, I will test each country in order, so be well-informed. In fact, aristocrats are systematically educated from childhood, but you only have two months to learn basic things. Therefore, you should not fool around and fulfill your daily obligations. Do you understand?\u201dJulietta looked helplessly down at the book, which was as thick as a pillow.The dancing was not difficult to learn, because it was included in the education Maribel had taught in the theater, along with the writing. But the aristocratic genealogy and so on were ridiculously hard, and the history of the continent was so difficult that the gates of Hell seemed to have opened.In particular, the laws of interaction according to the nobility\u2019s titles and positions, and the different dialogue methods dependent on each other were so complicated that she really wanted to cry. Order of admission at a party, etiquette for talking among ladies of her age, refusing a request to dance, greetings at the first and second meeting, etiquette for using the lounge, and so on. They were so complicated and tricky that it was disturbing whether she could perform the role of Princess Kiellini without making a mistake.Regina\u2019s private maid quietly visited Simone who was briefly explaining what to learn tomorrow. \u201cMadame, Lady Regina is asking you to come by the separate house.\u201d\u201cRegina?\u201d\u201cYes, she wants you to visit with the lady.\u201d Regina\u2019s maid said, slightly pointing to Julietta as if she didn\u2019t want to call her a lady. Simone nodded, and her sigh came out without knowing.\u201cAll right. Tell her we will visit as soon as the class is over,\u201d Simone said to Regina\u2019s maid. Simone replied, \u201cDon\u2019t disturb us and step away.\u201d\u201cShe said you should come right now.\u201d\u201cShe does not know what the situation is now, or even if I am meeting a guest, but she said that I should come now?\u201dEven though Simone was so upset, the maid only repeated the same words. \u201cYes. My lady has asked you to visit her in the separate house right now.\u201dSimone\u2019s palm hit the desk. She knew the child\u2019s selfish behavior from the beginning, but these days she felt it was strangely unpleasant.However, no matter how much she was an aunt who had cared for her since she was a child, Simone could not disobey Regina. The real power in the mansion of the Duke in Tilia Territory did not lay in Simone, who was replacing the hostess, but in Regina, who was sick and might die at any time.When she thought that, she realized that she didn\u2019t have to make a fuss about useless things. Simone rose straight from her seat.\u201cFollow me.\u201d After instructing Julietta, she left the room to take a carriage to get to the annex.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\u201cCome here. The freshly harvested laya tea leaves came in today. Since it is the tea you like a lot, I asked her to bring you here. Please sit here.\u201dRegina wore an indoor dress and a thin shawl that reached her wrists despite the hot summer weather, and looked worse than before.Julietta bent her knees and bowed politely to Regina, who refused to give her a look. Regina poured tea into Simone\u2019s teacup without acknowledging Julietta\u2019s greeting.\u201cYou\u2019ve been working so hard to erase the traces of a dirty bastard. It is tolerable to see how she says hello.\u201d\u201cFortunately, she learned basic etiquette and dancing when she was a kid. She is smart and has a good learning ability.\u201dRegina nodded at Simone\u2019s answer. \u201cThat\u2019s a relief. But I can\u2019t help but feel uneasy. Because every action, every mistake, every word that she shows in Dublin is in my name.\u201dThe maids quickly pulled Julietta to their side, as Regina made an irritated gesture. When Julietta stepped into the corner and stood side by side with Regina\u2019s maids, Regina looked at them as if she were satisfied.\u201cYou really fit in. Everyone has their own place. Learning and studying aristocratic manners doesn\u2019t make you a noble. Auntie, look. She worked as a maid, and isn\u2019t every figure standing next to that child just a maid?\u201dRegina gasped for a moment, after laughing cheerfully, as if it was funny. Her body couldn\u2019t keep up with the sudden change of mood.In the past, she would be surprised and run right away to check on Regina\u2019s condition, but Simone only said, \u201cDon\u2019t you know it\u2019s not good for your body to get so excited? Be careful.\u201dRegina barely calmed down and when she saw Simone take the tea cup and savord the tea after offering emotionless consolation, asked, \u201cYou must be feeling bad. You are feeling bad since I blamed this girl, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cIt can\u2019t be. It\u2019s a fact that she is an illegitimate child and worked as a maid not long ago. There\u2019s no reason why I\u2019m not feeling well.\u201d\u201cThen why are you so upset?\u201d\u201cI had a lot of work to do, but I was just nervous for a while because I felt like I was wasting my afternoon. Never mind.\u201d\u201cI see. I shouldn\u2019t ask my aunt over for a cup of tea anytime like before, but I forgot.\u201dRegina clearly revealed that she was in a bad mood. Simone sighed and said soothingly, \u201cI feel uneasy just thinking about how horrible things will be if this fails. How much attention do people have to pay to Princess Kiellini, who has never been seen before? I can\u2019t sleep these days because I think if this girl makes a mistake, it\u2019s going to be all over.\u201d\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t happen. My aunt won\u2019t fail, right?\u201dRegina\u2019s childishness, which appeared every time she needed it, suddenly felt disgusting. Simone shook her head in surprise.\u2018What am I thinking now?\u2026 I guess I\u2019ve really been nervous lately.\u2019Simone stood up from her seat and said, \u201cI have to go. Like you said, it is a long way to go before I take off the dirt of her being a bastard and a maid. I enjoyed the tea. I think the smell has become richer this year.\u201dRegina\u2019s eyes were happy at Simone\u2019s words. \u201cIs that right? If I blend it with any bitter or sour tea, I can smooth them out with its flavor. This new method of cultivation is quite effective.\u201dRegina had showed keen interest in the cultivation and combination of tea leaves, the family\u2019s business. Simone used to click her tongue, because it was the same with Duke Kiellini.Come to think of it, however, it was only when Regina\u2019s mother Katrina began to get sick that the Duke became interested in growing tea leaves. Regina\u2019s interest in growing tea leaves, efficacy, and the combination techniques she learned from her father might be a compensation for her weakness.It was a tea business that had been handed down from generation to generation, and Tilia Territory was the highest quality tea-leaf producing place on the continent. Simone was not interested in it, so she thought they were just amazing.\u201cI\u2019ll send you a combination of scents that you\u2019ll like. This tea will work a little better for your headache.\u201dThe friendly look of Regina relieved Simone somewhat, seeing the return of the niece she knew.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Francis, Part VITranslator: KhanEditor: Aelryinth\u201cYes, please. Julietta, let\u2019s go back.\u201dRegina went out to the terrace and saw Simone leaving in the carriage with Julietta, and muttered, \u201cWhy don\u2019t your headaches get better even if you drink tea which is good for your health? Isn\u2019t that weird?\u201dAs Iris stared at the wagon which became smaller and smaller, she turned around and went back into the room.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Julietta\u2019s education went smoothly, but Simone did not let Julietta out of the room until she was fully familiar with the nobility.Today, Julietta was listening to Simone\u2019s rambling speech on her habit of standing on one leg, of shrugging her shoulders, and of shaking her head. Simone had been nagging her for a long time, and ordered Vera to bring her the usual tea, as she had a headache again.\u201cDon\u2019t you drink too much?\u201dIn less than two hours after she entered Julietta\u2019s bedroom, Simone was already asking for a fourth cup of tea. They said that even the healthiest food was not good if eaten too much, and Julietta started to worry about Simone drinking tea like water.Simone\u2019s look softened slightly on the expression of Julietta looking down on the mug with suspicious eyes, a scowl on her face. Though she would have snapped when angry if it was the same as before, she did not want to do that for some reason.Simone had been screaming at the top of her lungs for a while and said in a strangely soft voice, \u201cI have a headache, so I can not continue without drinking tea.\u201d\u201cHave you had a checkup by a doctor? I think it\u2019s better to figure out the root cause rather than rely on the tea.\u201dJulietta was reminded of various diseases of the brain that she had seen in modern times. \u2018Is the same kind of illness present here?\u2019\u201cOf course I did. The doctor said he could not find any other particular cause of the headache, and just said that it could be neurotic.\u201dAs she tilted her head, Julietta thought, \u2018Heavens, I made the same mistake about my habit.\u2019 This habit was not easily fixed, so it seemed to be serious. Julietta waited for the angry scolding that would follow, but Simone was quietly drinking tea without saying anything.Julietta pursued the subject further, \u201cIf it is neurotic, is it because of the princess? Are you worried that I will make a mistake?\u201dSimone glanced at Julietta like she had sinned, as she had once again shrugged her shoulders.\u201cOf course, I\u2019m up to something so dangerous that I can\u2019t help but care. So don\u2019t have any unnecessary sinful thoughts, and just impress what you\u2019ve learned in your body and your mind so that my headaches don\u2019t get any worse,\u201d Julietta said to Simone, who was sitting up as if she was going to do the class again.\u201cIf you have a headache that has no particular cause, why don\u2019t you try exercising and reduce the number of times you drink tea?\u201d\u201cExercise? What do headaches have to do with exercise?\u201d\u201cThe root of all illnesses is lack of exercise. I\u2019ve noticed that you don\u2019t seem to leave the mansion at all. If you stay in the house like that, you\u2019ll definitely get sick.\u201dJulietta turned her neck herself and massaged her shoulders. \u201cIf you take some time to take a walk in the fresh air and do this neck workout or massage your shoulders\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat kind of a hideous act is that?\u201d Simone had been soft for a while, and her attitude completely changed attitude all of a sudden, as if she had never done so. Julietta stopped rubbing her shoulders, which had stiffened while maintaining her rigid posture, immediately.\u201cWhat the Hell have you learned so far? Do we need to start all over again?\u201dAt Simone\u2019s words, Julietta straightened her quickly. \u201cNo, I\u2019ll continue with what I was doing earlier,\u201d Julietta grumbled, adjusting her position as she covered her mouth, her gaze direct, and recalled how to express her feelings with a folded fan.\u201cCan\u2019t I just say things? I feel it\u2019s a waste of time to use a fan to express my feelings during a conversation.\u201dJulietta once again recalled what it meant when she put her fan around her right eye, what she wanted to say when she tapped it on her right arm, what she felt when she folded it, and had to endure the urge to throw the silk fan she was holding out the window. Simone stood in front of Julietta, resetting the delicate position of the fan.\u201cYou\u2019ll find it very convenient when you don\u2019t want to say anything uncomfortable. For example, if you want to refuse a dance request your opponent requests, it\u2019s better to express your feelings with a fan than to think about what you say. Down further!\u201dJulieta adjusted the position of the fan as Simone had said. \u201cOh, well, that would be convenient.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s as dangerous as it is comfortable. If you do something wrong, you might generate a misunderstanding. Therefore, you should be familiar with the correct usage. Again, not there.\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014That evening, Julietta was finally released from Simone well after dinner, and fell into bed.\u201cYou have to change your clothes, so get up. And a noble lady does not lie on the bed like that, or the bed might break.\u201dShe thought she was finally free from Simone\u2019s nagging, but now she was tormented by Vera.\u201cVera, just give me a break today. My arms are so numb and my back is stiff because of the fan language and whatnot.\u201dJulietta lay face down, clasping her right fist, opening it, and made a sound of pain. Vera grabbed her arm as she was lying on the bed and began to massage it up and down.\u201cUh, your hands are so cool. But I\u2019m fine, so you can stop. I\u2019ll get up.\u201d Julietta raised herself in bed, stopping Vera\u2019s massage.\u201cVera, you stood up all day and had a hard time waiting on the Marquise, so sit down and take a rest.\u201dVera turned her head, as if she hadn\u2019t noticed Julietta bending and straightening to loosen her habitually stiff waist.\u201cMy lady, I have to bring you your meal, so you should change your clothes first.\u201dJulietta had to wear a corset and panier, which she had never worn before to get used to it, and gazed at Vera pathetically.\u201cThen, can I change into my pajamas right away? There\u2019s no one coming into the room anyway.\u201dVera looked at Julietta as poorly as possible, and said as helplessly, \u201cToday only. If madame finds out, you\u2019ll be in big trouble.\u201d\u201cYes, just today.\u201dJulietta changed into her favorite pajamas, the prince\u2019s gift, and laid down on the bed with a happy expression.\u201cDon\u2019t fall asleep, wait for me. New pajamas have arrived; I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re only wearing the weird pajamas.\u201dVera looked back at Julietta rolling around in her bed, while she organized the clothes.\u201cThe new pajamas are so stiff, with lace and ruffle edges, that I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll choke to death on the lace while sleeping.\u201d\u201cI think such a big pajamas would be equally uncomfortable.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m used to them now. I know how to sleep comfortably and not get tangled up.\u201d Julietta buried her face in a soft blanket and smiled happily. \u201cI\u2019m so happy to be able to sleep in these bedclothes. Even though education is hard and I\u2019m worried about the debut party in a month.\u201dThinking of the days when she had been living in the theater\u2019s prop warehouse, when she was a maid, and sleeping next to the prince\u2019s bed on a trip, Julietta rubbed her face against a blanket that smelled so good.Vera looked at Julietta, who was happy about nothing, and she thought of Lady Regina. She was a cousin of the same blood at the same age, but she didn\u2019t understand why their background, personality, and behavior were so different.\u201cYes, my lady. I\u2019ll go get a meal. Please wait, even if you\u2019re hungry.\u201dVera smiled unconsciously at Julietta, who had answered by bobbing her feet up and down.\u2018It would be better if she were a real princess. That would make her madame more comfortable.\u2019Vera was surprised by the casual thought, and quickly shook her head and went downstairs.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201dWatching Simone who was drinking the tea that was good for headaches again, Julietta rose from her seat and began to massage her shoulders.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Francis, Part VIITranslator: KhanEditor: AelryinthAfter learning fan etiquette and how to use it at the debut party for several days, she was learning about tea party etiquette today. Julietta was following the instructions of Simone, who was seated across the table, but was unable to bear it any more.\u201cIt\u2019s already been three drinks today. It\u2019s still before lunch, and I\u2019m afraid of how many drinks you\u2019ll have until you fall asleep if you keep drinking like that.\u201dJulietta ignored Simone\u2019s scolding and loosened the knotted muscles of her shoulders and back with a massage. At first, Simone tried to avoid Julietta\u2019s hands, but soon stopped.\u201cHow is it? Are you feeling better? If you relax the knotted muscles of your neck and shoulders every day, your headache will improve a lot.\u201dSimone was already feeling her body relax as soon as Julietta gave her a massage. Strangely, her heavy head seemed to clear up, and the stabbing pain subsided.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you reduce your tea drinking to as little as possible and get a massage like this?\u201dWhen Simone, who would normally say something in a shrill voice, had nothing to say, Julietta became even more excited. \u201cIt\u2019s not that hot today, so why don\u2019t we practice tea drinking in the garden? And we also take a walk. Can\u2019t you announce that I am slowly recovering and can move?\u201dSimone, contrary to her usual neurotic attitude, gently said at Julietta\u2019s question, \u201cYou must be frustrated.\u201d\u201cYes. Actually, I\u2019ve been in the room for almost a month, except the time I went to the annex. And while it\u2019s frustrating, it\u2019s also true that having a light walk and fresh air is good for your headache.\u201d\u201cAunt! You should take care to call me aunt even unconsciously.\u201d\u201cAh! Yes, aunt.\u201dSimone got up from her seat. \u201cYes, let\u2019s have tea in the garden, as you say. Vera, get the Dureng tea out.\u201dSince she had started drinking tea that relieved her headaches, it had been a long time since she had drunk another tea. Simone smiled slightly, feeling a little excited with her lightened head.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Two months had already passed since Julietta came to the Tilia Territory.There was no further encounter with the princess Iris\u2026 no, Regina, except for the day she had visited with Simone. The meeting with her that day was so poor that Julietta did not want to see her at all.Julietta had been enduring the harsh training of Simone for a month in the room without moving around, and was able to slowly get out of the room and start working freely after teatime training in the garden. Over the course of two months, Julietta worked hard at playing the role of Princess Kiellini who had recovered her health and was preparing for her social debut.Although she now had such an elegant posture that the strict Simone could not nag much, Julietta was still learning dance and etiquette, in order to emulate the natural air of nobility who had learned them since childhood. Even though she was now a perfect Iris Regina Kiellini on the outside, Simone was still repeating the same education, unable to hide her anxiety.\u2014\u2014\u201cMy lady, I\u2019ve brought the tea.\u201dThe maid came in with the tea as Julietta finished her afternoon education. She sighed for a moment before dinner, looking at the scenery outside the terrace. \u201cDian, did you come out here with permission?\u201dThe small maid smiled shyly and nodded at the question. \u201cYes, my lady.\u201dDian was a maid brought to Tilia Castle a month ago by a newly deployed knight, Sir Caden. It was rare for a knight to have a maid instead of a servant, so everyone was flustered, but Sir Caden said that he had just saved the girl, who had no place to go, and asked them to hire her if they needed a maid in Tilia.The request of the heir of the family of Count Caden, was not that of a regular knight, and Simone could not refuse to accept Dian as a maid. Dian was doing chores at the mansion like that, and she saw Julietta dozing off in the garden a few weeks ago while she was playing the role of a substitute for Iris.Though it was late summer, the heat had yet to fully dissipate, so she thought she had to wake her up, and approached hesitantly. The open book had come into her eyes. Dian, who could only tell that the white part was a piece of paper and black parts were letters, looked down at the book she could not read, and had then inquired of Julietta after she opened her eyes.\u201cDo you know how to read?\u201dDian stepped back in spite of herself, frightened by the question of the noble lady. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, my lady. I came to wake you up because I thought you\u2019d get sick if you went to sleep outside\u2026\u201dDian\u2019s frightened apology made Julietta feel a pain in her heart. She knew the maid\u2019s feelings better than anyone else, because she had lived the life of a maid, whose days changed at the whims of high-ranking officials. She smiled softly at the nervous maid.\u201cI\u2019m just asking. It\u2019s kind of you to come to wake me up on purpose. If I were you, I would rather run away than deliberately wake someone up, since I might have scolded.\u201dDian was dazed for a moment, seeing Julietta smiling brightly. The \u2018Under The Wings of Angels\u2019 she grew up in was a place where there were many dazzling beauties. Dian, who had a normal appearance, was not chosen because of her poor figure. Even to Dian, who had seen all the beauties in such a place, the lady before her eyes was so beautiful.The combination of the brilliant blonde hair with pinkish tones, the clear green eyes like jewels, the bluish transparent skin that was so fair, was so dazzling that it was sinful for a low-class person like her to look at it.At the same time as her guilty thoughts, Dian recalled her past. The blonde hair and green eyes of Phoebe, who had gotten out of the brothel together with her\u2026\u2018Is it a coincidence that the hair and eyes of the two are the same color?\u2019Dian recalled her orders: if she worked in the Tilia Territory, she had to report to Raphael everything she saw and heard, and she hoped without realizing that what he was doing was not harmful to the lady in front of her.\u201cWhy are you just looking at me like that? Oh, it\u2019s because I\u2019m so pretty, isn\u2019t it? Thank you, but I know it well, so you don\u2019t have to compliment me.\u201d Julietta said in a light voice edged with laughter, then asked, \u201cYou looked at it earlier because you wanted to read a book, right? It\u2019s not mine, but it\u2019ll be okay if I lend it to you. If you return it after reading, who will know? Here, take it. When you give it back, you have to give it to me without anyone knowing. All right?\u201dDian was staring blankly at the book Julietta was handing her, but she shook her head in surprise.\u201dOh, no. I can\u2019t read. I just looked at it casually. I am sorry, my lady.\u201dWhen Dian bowed down and apologized, Julietta stopped her up and said, \u201cYou wanted to learn how to write, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have been interested in the book if you hadn\u2019t thought about it.\u201dAt the words of Julietta, Dian dropped her head as her conscience was pricked.\u2018Writing? I had got out of Hell, but it seems that my greed has grown bigger and bigger.\u2019\u201cYou think you are too greedy, don\u2019t you?\u201dDian raised her head in surprise at the lady who seemed to have read her mind, and Julietta waved her finger and scolded her, \u201cEven if there is a difference in status, everyone needs to cherish and care for themselves. You should never hurt or hurt others, but greed to improve yourself is not a bad thing.\u201dDian was staring at her as Julietta continued, \u201cIf you like, come see me when you have time. I\u2019ll teach you how to write.\u201dJulietta\u2019s words gave Dian great hope. Dian had been born in the brothel and lived a hopeless life there; the outside world of Rotesam was truly amazing. Just getting out of that hell gave her a lifetime of gratitude, and she had vowed to be thankful for all her life. The lady in front of her said was that it was not a bad thing to care for herself unless she hurt others. The words made her heart throb.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Francis, Part VIIITranslator: KhanEditor: AelryinthShe wanted to learn how to write. If possible, she wanted to be a maid who did more important work than just chores\u2026 like serving the lady in front of her.\u2014\u2014Dian\u2019s little dream began from then. Julietta was willing to invest her time for Dian.Dian began to learn, little by little, from Julietta. Julietta couldn\u2019t spare much time with her, because she had to avoid Simone\u2019s eyes, but that short time was so happy.Julietta wanted to teach Dian everything she knew, not just writing. She taught Dian the manners she had learned that day, reviewed them, taught her to dance, and they practiced dancing together.\u2014\u2014To Julietta, Dian was like a new friend. Julietta soon told Dian about another world she knew of.\u201cIs there really no difference in social status?\u201d\u201cThey don\u2019t have a visible social class. The country votes for the king, and the people choose who they want. They also protest for him to step down if the king does something wrong.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s great. I think it\u2019s a great country, even just listening to it.\u201d\u201cIf poor people study hard in that country, they can get a good job and explore their future. Of course, it\u2019s more difficult than going through a needle hole, but they\u2019re still given the chance, and they develop themselves with hope.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s really exciting to hear. Where is this country? I want to go too! If I go and try hard, I think I can have a better life.\u201dJulietta shook her head with a sad expression. \u201cUnfortunately, the road to the country has been cut off. I could come out, but I couldn\u2019t go back.\u201dJulietta asked, looking down at the crooked letters on the paper in front of Dian, \u201cDian, did you hear anything about me when you followed Sir Caden?\u201dDian was at a loss for words when Julietta asked.\u201cI know that you know who I am. When I was practicing teaching you what I had learned because I was bad at manners, you never showed that it was weird. No matter how sick Princess Kiellini has been since she was a child, even if she was learning all the education for her debut for the first time, it must have been weird to you.\u201dWhen Dian lowered her eyes with a sorry face, Julietta laughed. \u201cDian, I\u2019m working hard now for a better future. I think Dian will also have a better future if you try. Don\u2019t you think so?\u201dDian raised her head carefully and looked up at Julietta. She smiled and answered excitedly at the sight of the lady with vivid green eyes smiling at her, \u201cYes! I\u2019m sure I will.\u201d\u201cYes, then let\u2019s work hard together! About ten years from now, the two of us will be laughing about today, saying \u2018Oh, that\u2019s what happened to us before. It was really hard back then.\u2019 \u201dDian nodded strongly at Julietta\u2019s words. \u201cYes. I want to speak to you with a smile in ten years!\u201d\u2014\u2014So Julietta and Dian spent their days happily relying on each other. However, Vera caught her while teaching writing and practicing dancing together with Dian, but only told her to be careful so that the Marquise wouldn\u2019t know.While studying with Dian like that again today, Vera came to her. She glanced at Dian who rose from the desk in a hurry, but again said nothing. \u201cMadame is looking for you.\u201d\u201cNow? Is something wrong?\u201d This was the time for Simone to take a nap before dinner. It was the only time of the day she could take a break, so Julietta asked why, but Vera only told her to go quickly.Julietta smiled apologetically at Dian and hurried to adjust her dress. She went straight down to Simone\u2019s bedroom on the second floor.\u201cDid you call me?\u201dSimone scanned the Duke\u2019s letter one more time and gestured to Julietta to sit down. \u201cMy brother sent me a message.\u201dSimone saw Julieta sitting there with her eyes drooping gently. She looked like a beautiful and elegant lady with dignity, who really had been born into the family of the Duke.\u2018Is it because half of her blood is noble?\u2019 She sighed, pressing down on her splitting forehead.\u201cNow that Iris\u2019s coming-of-age ceremony is a month away, he\u2019s asking us to come up to the capital for the rest of our preparations.\u201dAs Simone said that, she recalled the situation when she had gone to see Regina a few days ago\u2026\u2014\u201cAunt, how\u2019s the girl\u2019s education going? Is she acting properly now? Is she enough that she will not do anything wrong to my name?\u201d Regina asked sharply with a remarkably haggard face.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s going well without much trouble. She\u2019s actually quite amazingly good at it.\u201dRegina\u2019s voice grew sharper at Simone\u2019s words. \u201cWhat a surprise! Does she look more like Princess Kielini than I do?\u201dSimone sighed unconsciously. Regina had been saying that for two months.\u201cI don\u2019t think so. How can she deceive her natural origins? You don\u2019t have to think about it because she can\u2019t keep up with your elegance and grace.\u201dEvery time she heard the same answer, Regina\u2019s anger melted away, so Simone gave her the answer she wanted, just like a machine.\u201cBut I heard that her mother was an actress in the theater. Where would that vulgarity go?\u201dToday she seemed to be in a worse mood, and she even mentioned the origin of the woman who had given birth to Julietta. Simone nodded sympathetically, as if to comfort Regina.\u201cYes, that\u2019s right. She can\u2019t deceive her origin. So, don\u2019t pay any more attention to the girl\u2019s work. I\u2019m worried that your health has gotten worse, because your face looks darker these days.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care about the girl. I\u2019m just getting nervous because of my strange life in a separate house. I need to send a message to my father. I can\u2019t wait to get her to Dublin and go back to the main house.\u201dRegina didn\u2019t think her sensitivity was due to an inferiority complex about Julietta. Simone shook her head at her niece, who thought it was just because she wanted to go back to the main house.\u201cYou\u2019d better put off going up to Dublin as much as you can. It\u2019s better to reduce people\u2019s interaction with you before and after her debut.\u201dRegina was only more irritated by Simone\u2019s advice. When the Duke was contacted by his daughter, he sent Simone a magic message\u2026\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\u201cHe\u2019s asking us to come up to Dublin to prepare for the debut.\u201dJulietta asked suspiciously at Simone\u2019s words, \u201cDidn\u2019t we decide to go up as late as possible?\u201dOriginally, she was supposed to go up to Dublin about two weeks before her debut. Even though she understood that Julietta might question the sudden change of schedule, Simone was upset.\u201cYou just have to do as you are told. My brother has an idea, so he wants us to come up faster than planned.\u201dWhen Simone reacted sharply to the little question, Julietta nodded as if she understood, \u201cWhen are we leaving?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll start early tomorrow morning.\u201dJulietta rose from her seat at the words and said, \u201cThen I have to pack up, so I\u2019ll leave.\u201dSimone didn\u2019t give her permission, but Julietta rose up from her seat as she pleased and went up. Simone soon gave up trying to scold her. On the day they were caught, the family of Duke Kiellini would disappear from the map, and under that fear, her body and her mind were exhausted. Still, she agreed to proceed with the tremendous work.In the beginning, she had visited Regina in the annex every day, but now it was hard enough to visit her twice a week\u2026At first, there had been a mixture of affection and sympathy when taking on her young niece. At the same time, she had come down to the countryside, boldly turning her back on the flamboyant society for the purpose of investing in her shaky future. Simone\u2019s rural life, which had begun like that, had been just hard, working day by day with her spoiled, selfish niece and cold brother.The reason she was now helping to make Julietta a substitute of Regina was that she didn\u2019t want to make all her work so far for nothing. She was forced to step in because she would be protected by the family of Duke Kiellini only if Regina became the next Duke.It started with mixed understanding, but as Iris\u2019s debut date approached, Simone began to be afraid as she returned to reality.But she could not turn it back, even if she regretted it now. The Duke of Kiellini, her brother, would not forgive her and in this mansion, there was Sir Caden, Maribel\u2019s grandson, who knew about it all\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 83": "Chapter 83 - Francis, Part IXPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 83. Francis, Part IXTranslator: KhanEditor: AelryinSimone, covering her aching head, ordered Vera to get ready to leave tomorrow.\u2014\u2014Maribel read the letter, which had no sender, and immediately put it to the candle. Looking at the burning paper, she thought, \u2018It\u2019s time to take care of what I\u2019ve been putting off\u2019, and frowned without realizing it.The letter said that Julietta would soon come to the capital. The curtain had finally risen on the stage.Maribel went into the rightmost of the two bedrooms at the heart of her residence, ready to clean up the mess before lifting the curtain. The room where Stella and young Julietta had stayed for a while was just the same as always, decorated for a child.Phoebe, lying on a light pink sheet, felt Maribel\u2019s presence and raised herself.Maribel never entered her room except when she came with a doctor who had given her painkillers and stopped by to see her condition. When she saw her coming in alone without the doctor, Phoebe pulled her broken leg and stepped out of bed.\u201cIs it time?\u201dAccording to the doctor, her right leg, which had been broken by an abusive guest, was completely disabled.Phoebe had moved from Lebatum to the largest theater in Austern, and lived in the home of Maribel, the owner of the theater. She didn\u2019t know what she would here, or why she was brought here, but on the evening of her arrival, through the words of a cold-faced silver-haired nobleman who visited late that night, she knew that she was someone\u2019s substitute.=======\u201cDon\u2019t they look too different?\u201dThe woman sitting quietly in a chair, like a prostitute waiting for a guest\u2019s command, had hair closer to light brown than blonde, and her eyes were green with brown spots. Moreover, she was not a teenager by any stretch of the imagination. However, Maribel smiled confidently as the Duke expressed concern over her appearance.\u201cShe is a child who the Marquise hasn\u2019t seen in eleven years. An appearance can change as one grows up. She is barely going to see the body, so how will she know? You don\u2019t have to worry.\u201dAll she would do for Stella\u2019s body was a glance at it with abhorrence. The Marquise, who had grown up as a noble, was hardly aware of such things.The Duke of Kielini accepted that part. He left Maribel\u2019s quarters and walked down the aisle leading to the back door, saying to the following Maribel, \u201cI\u2019ll send someone when it\u2019s time.\u201d\u201cI can take care of it, but if you\u2019re nervous, do it yourself.\u201d Maribel told the Duke, since he did not trust her completely.\u201cUse the post office when you need to contact me. To send it by messenger is dangerous. Send it without a signature.\u201dAfter climbing the secret stairs to the first floor and seeing the Duke go out to the back door and leave in a carriage, Maribel returned to the room where Phoebe was.\u201cI\u2019ll call a doctor because the painkillers you took during the move seem to have lost their potency. You shouldn\u2019t leave this room without my permission. Take a rest.\u201dThe next day, the doctor visited to administer the painkiller, and said she would not live long unless she cut off her leg. When Phoebe did not say anything, the doctor explained the new prosthetic leg. The doctor thought she was repelled at the idea of amputating her leg because of her appearance, and eagerly explained, but Phoebe knew why she had been brought here.Compared to the hell where she had not been able to die and been in pain, this place was heaven. But she couldn\u2019t be so greedy as to live.When she heard that she might be able to live by cutting off her leg, she had hope for a moment. The hostess brought her here, but just in case she would cut off her leg, cure, and hire her, Phoebe looked up at her without knowing herself, but then dropped her eyes.When Maribel saw Phoebe looking at her with low expectations and then shaking her head in a hurry, she ordered Liam, the theater\u2019s manager, to take out the doctor. She opened her mouth in a careful voice when they were left alone.\u201cDo you want to live? If you want to live, I can save your life, if you can pay back the money and the medical bills I spent to bring you here. This is a place where there are many aristocrats who like beautiful women. Some of them may like a woman who depends on them with unusual blonde hair and green eyes and a strange body. You can pay off your debts over the years if you do it that way. Do you want that?\u201dPhoebe shook her head at the cruel reality.\u2018Why do I keep forgetting that the world wasn\u2019t such an easy place? Even if I survive by selling myself to pay for treatment and ransom, the rest of my life will be the same as it has been. All that has changed was a broken leg is now a missing leg. What would I do to live the rest of my life?\u2019Maribel spoke softly to Phoebe, who was gently lowering her eyes. \u201cJust think that this wasn\u2019t your life. Instead, I\u2019ll pray for you to be reborn in a life that is happier and has more in it than anyone else. I\u2019ll bury your body in a sunny place.\u201dIf she had died in \u2018Under The Wings of Angels,\u2019 she would have been harassed for days by people who indulged in necrophilia. Such abandoned bodies would not find freedom until they became food for wild beasts and could not be identified. Phoebe decided to thank her for escaping from such a fate.Over the next month, Phoebe was able to rest her tired body sufficiently in her own space for the first time in her life. Quietly preparing for the end, she realized that the day had finally come at the sight of the hostess who had come to her\u2026======Maribel replied calmly to Phoebe, \u201cNot now. I\u2019ll have a visitor later tonight. I\u2019ve come to ask if there\u2019s anything you want to do in the hours remaining until the end.\u201dAt Maribel\u2019s words, Phoebe hesitated for a moment.She would die anyway, but she was afraid that she would hesitate to give up her life with something new in her eyes. But at the same time, she felt it was unfair to die like this. Maribel waited in silence, as if she understood Phoebe\u2019s hesitation.After much deliberation, Phoebe looked up as she had finally made up her mind.\u201cI\u2019ve never been to the theater that I used to listen to so much, so I want to see the stage. I want to make sure it\u2019s exactly what I imagined. If it\u2019s beautiful and colorful, I think I could die happily. I don\u2019t want to die thinking about a miserable place until the end.\u201dAt Phoebe\u2019s words, Maribel turned and left the room, saying, \u201cI\u2019ll send a woman. I can\u2019t let you walk around the theater in that outfit.\u201dMoments later, Amelie and Sophie came in with a dress for actresses from the prop room. Sophie blurted out while putting on her dress, \u201cYou look like our Julietta. I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s doing well.\u201dWhen she saw the light brown hair that looked almost blonde, Amelie criticized her when Sophie thought of Julietta and spoke without being aware of her words.\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear the boss telling you to come out after dressing her, and not to say anything?\u201dPhoebe looked down at the small woman, who shut her mouth and arranged the dress she had put on her. She didn\u2019t know who Julietta was, but it seemed she was to die instead of the woman named Julietta. After a moment of jealousy, Phoebe shook her head and chased away the bad idea.\u2018Hasn\u2019t the girl helped me get out of that hell and have a new experience?\u2019Phoebe somehow empathized with someone she didn\u2019t even know, and wanted the lady named Julietta to be happy on her behalf. If that happened, she thought she would be born with a very precious status in her next life and live happily.When she finished grooming, Amelie took Phoebe to the mirror on one side of the room. Phoebe smiled slightly at herself in the mirror.It was a dress that looked quite virtuous, unlike the one she had worn when she had been receiving guests at the brothel.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 84": "Chapter 84 - Francis, Part XPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 84. Francis, Part XTranslator: KhanEditor: AelryinIt was probably a dress worn when someone played the role of a noblewoman.Although there was a twisted leg fixed by splints beneath the fine and beautiful dress, and a wooden cane in her right hand, it looked quite nice. Phoebe was a little flustered lifting her ruffled sleeves, and thanked the two for helping her dress up.Wearing the stage dress, she was guided by Amelie and Sophie and entered a small box seat set up for wealthy merchants. When the lights of the box-seat went out and the curtain rose, the play started.\u2014\u2014Phoebe watched the hour-long performance of the actors crying, laughing, and singing. After the scene where the tragic heroine died with her lover, the waiting servant approached and lowered the curtain on the box seat.Moved to the heart by the sound of the first-ever singing and actors\u2019 performances she had seen, and the praise and hot cheers of the audience, Phoebe sat still, enjoying the lingering image until all the lights went out and the inside of the theater grew quiet.It was so depressing and sad that she had to leave this overwhelming emotion behind and go back to her room and wait for death. Phoebe rose from her seat, rejecting the idea that she would like to sit here forever and delay the coming future.Maribel, wearing a dark red dress, was waiting for her as she opened the door and came out into the hallway where the lights were off. Thinking she was like a witch rising out of a fire pit, Phoebe turned and followed Maribel as she walked away.\u201cThe person he sent is waiting now. I thought you\u2019d have a little more time, but he sent the person earlier than I expected.\u201dPhoebe trembled at Maribel\u2019s words. When she returned to the residence she had stayed at for the last month, her life would end.Phoebe strode on as she walked one step and another towards death, limping on her broken leg. For twenty-six years, the only thing she could remember was living in a brothel, but she got on a boat at the end and experienced the Magic Square, and was able to watch opera today.Phoebe hummed a passage from the opera she had seen earlier. The first song she had heard was playing in her head.Their movements were very slow because of the pace of the lame Phoebe. Maribel was walking down the stairs leading down the long corridor to the basement and said calmly, \u201d\u201cYou sound so sweet. If you were fine, and if you had a chance, you\u2019d be good on stage.\u201dPhoebe laughed with delight at the unexpected compliment. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing that I\u2019m going to die knowing that I am good at something.\u201dPhoebe hummed a little louder, as if she were confident. Phoebe and Maribel listened to the humming without a word, and came to their room.Phoebe whispered to Maribel as she opened the door and was about to enter, \u201cThank you for taking me out of that terrible place and letting me watch the opera. I hope the girl who looks like me is twice as happy as I am.\u201dThe door opened inside, perhaps feeling their presence when she spoke.Seeing that the servant who had always followed the Duke had been the one to come, Maribel thought that the Duke seemed to want very few people involved in this matter. Maribel entered her residence as his servant looked on impatiently.\u201cThis is the medicine His Excellency gave me.\u201dThe most suitable reason for the death of a healthy young woman was sudden death.\u201cWhat poison is it?\u201d Maribel asked, taking the brown potion in a forefinger-sized glass bottle.\u201cI don\u2019t know. I just have what His Excellency gave me. She\u2019ll die quietly without pain, so please feed her quickly.\u201dMaribel glanced at Phoebe standing still, and pulled out the lid of the bottle she was holding. Phoebe took the brown potion and gulped it down with no hesitation.Phoebe blinked with embarrassment after drinking the potion. The Duke\u2019s servant said to her calmly, \u201cIf you wait a moment, there will be a reaction.\u201dThe doctor gave her a separate painkiller, but her legs began to ache because she had been up and down the stairs and was standing longer than usual. Phoebe waited for her imminent death. She couldn\u2019t stand it and asked in a small voice, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Can I sit down for a while? My legs are so weak\u2026\u201dWhen Phoebe asked if she could sit down, saying that she was sorry even in the face of death, Maribel was speechless.\u2018What kind of life have you lived? You give up everything and remain calm about anything that comes along?\u2019 Her own dark past seemed to twist in her mind.\u201cSit down. You won\u2019t have to stand and wait until you\u2019re out of breath.\u201dWith her permission, Phoebe limped along to a waiting chair lying on one side and sat down carefully.Ten minutes, twenty minutes, time passed by. While Phoebe waited for her death in a gentle manner, Maribel said, \u201cI\u2019d rather have her in bed if it was going to take so long.\u201dThomas, the Duke of Kiellini\u2019s servant, was inwardly embarrassed by her reaction, which was different than what he had heard from the Duke. Contrary to what he had been told, that she would die within ten minutes of drinking, the woman who had taken the potion became slightly stifled, but was still alive even though it was almost thirty minutes away. He would have thought something was wrong if he hadn\u2019t seen her drink the potion himself.As he started to think that he had given her the wrong medicine, Phoebe suddenly seized her heart.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dPhoebe thought her death had finally come, as her chest became stuffy and her eyes became blurred. She finally put the frowning Maribel in her eyes, and then closed her heavy eyelids.Her darkened vision brought to mind the splendid opera she had seen earlier. She sang softly and prayed for a better life in her next life\u2026\u2014\u201cShe\u2019s not breathing.\u201dMaribel stared at the servant without realizing it, and laid Phoebe on the floor herself. \u201cI will send a letter to Mrs. Anais. If you stay, you\u2019ll be seen by people. Are you okay?\u201d\u201cWill the Marquise come this night?\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s been waiting for this death more than anyone else, so she\u2019ll come running right away. I can\u2019t wait to finish this work before morning comes, and I want to rest.\u201dAt Maribel\u2019s words, Thomas checked the prone woman once more and left the theater. Maribel saw him off to the rear gate of the first floor, crossed the hall on the first floor, and extended a letter she had brought to Liam, who was waiting at his room by the main gate.\u201cGive it to Marquise Anais. You can deliver this letter, saying that the item which was left behind by the Marquise was damaged.\u201d\u2014When Liam set out, Maribel returned to her dwelling place.When she saw the dead body in a stage costume, Maribel unexpectedly clicked her tongue. Because the Duke\u2019s servant had arrived earlier than expected, she didn\u2019t care about removing the dress. Feeling a little irritated by her mistake, she went to the room where Phoebe had stayed and come out with the clothes she had worn and bedsheets.Suddenly, she heard a cough as she turned to Phoebe\u2019s body to change her clothes.Cough, cough, cough, retch!Phoebe was thought to be dead, but she coughed breathlessly and suddenly vomited brown fluid. Maribel watched the pale ivory rug turn brown blankly, and turned Phoebe to her side.After coughing for a time, Phoebe vomited a lump of dark red blood and opened her eyes after breathing hard. Maribel stared down at Phoebe, stood up, and picked up the water pipe lying on the desk.Maribel only calmed down after sucking on the water pipe several times with trembling hands, sitting against a desk facing Phoebe. She thought she might have to kill Phoebe again before the Marquise came, but couldn\u2019t put it into practice.While she was floundering and her thoughts were splitting into ten thousand branches, Phoebe finally raised herself up. She was shaking her head and saw Maribel looking at her.\u201cAh\u2026\u201d With blood all around her mouth and chin, Phoebe was embarrassed and apologized, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I guess I didn\u2019t die at once. Do you have any more of that poison?\u201dMaribel\u2019s thoughts were complicated when she saw Phoebe saying she was sorry for not dying at once, and giving up so neatly. \u201cThis must be your destiny. What will it do for you and me to survive without dying? I was thinking about tossing a coin, but my heart is whispering that I have to save you.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Francis, Part XITranslator: KhanEditor: AelryinMaribel put the water pipe she was holding down on the desk and moved toward Phoebe.\u201cThere\u2019s no time. Come on. Get up. You have to change your clothes before the Marquise comes.\u201dMaribel coolly turned Phoebe who was staggering and then hurriedly stripped her dress off. Maribel dressed Phoebe in the simple dress she had bought in Lebatum on her way out of the brothel, and ordered her to lie down again.\u201cNow a noblewoman will come to see your body soon. She won\u2019t get close, but you\u2019ll have to hold your breath as long as you can, like you\u2019re dead. Can you do it?\u201dOf course! She had to do it because she could survive. Even if she had to hold her breath and die, she had to seize the opportunity given her.As soon as Phoebe nodded hard and laid down again, Maribel put the sheet on top of her head. The moment she threw the stage dress Phoebe had worn into the side room and came back into the living room, the door opened without any warning.The Marquise entered Maribel\u2019s residence in a hurry, her braided hair to one side, dressed in a simple out-of-the-way suit and a hat with a thick veil. As soon as she opened the door, Ivana turned to Maribel, looking down at the body covered with a sheet that was visible as soon as the door was opened.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. After directing the evening performance, I came down and found that she fell to the floor like this.\u201d\u201cWhat was the cause of death?\u201d\u201cI couldn\u2019t call a doctor and check it out, so I don\u2019t know. I tried to take her out before anyone could see her, but I thought you\u2019d want to check on the body, so I called you in a hurry.\u201dIvana ordered the maid following her to take off the sheet.The frightened maid lifted one end of the sheet slightly. Under the bright magical light, the maid stepped back, dropping the sheet in surprise as the blood-stained face was revealed. Despite the hideous appearance, Ivana checked the hair color and features and ordered the maid, \u201cCheck the color of her eyes.\u201dWhen the flustered maid couldn\u2019t think of putting her hand on the body\u2019s face, Maribel approached her, deftly covered the body, and raised Phoebe\u2019s eyelids.\u201cGreen, green eyes, madam,\u201d the quick-checking maid said and then retreated to the doorway. Maribel calmly covered the body with the sheet, stood up, and looked back at Marquise Anais.\u201cWhy did she die just as His Excellency, Marquis Anais, was out of Austern?\u201dIvana flew into a rage when Maribel asked doubtfully, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me, you suspect I killed her?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen. If you had been thinking about that, you wouldn\u2019t have waited until now. I just thought it was weird.\u201d Ivana turned away, irritated by Maribel\u2019s words, without seeking further confirmation.\u201cTake care of the body. You should not bury her where her mother is, and nothing should fall into the sight of the Marquis.\u201d\u201cYes, ma\u2019am. Don\u2019t worry. I am not a person who would make such a mistake. I hope you\u2019ll go home and sleep well.\u201dIvana thought that Maribel\u2019s antagonism was because she felt sorry for Julietta\u2019s death, and replied with a rare soft voice, \u201cI understand how sorry you are for the loss of the child you\u2019ve been raising. But I really didn\u2019t do anything. I know even His Excellency thinks she was already dead, so I didn\u2019t have to think of killing her. In my heart, it\u2019s been a long time since she died.\u201dIvana said her piece and went out without saying goodbye. Maribel closed the door behind her as she disappeared with Liam, who was waiting outside.Maribel looked outside to find any indication of people at the door for a while before calling for Phoebe, who was still lying down, after enough time had passed. \u201cGet up.\u201dAt Maribel\u2019s command, Phoebe took off the sheet and sat up carefully. When she began to massage her leg, feeling pain as the medicine\u2019s effect seemed to have disappeared with her vomiting, Maribel took a pill from the room, gave it to her, and said, \u201cYou\u2019re dead as of today\u2019s date. Phoebe from the Rotesam brothel is no longer in the world. Therefore, I can\u2019t keep you by my side, because you and I don\u2019t know each other at all. I want to get you out of here as soon as possible, but I wonder if it\u2019s even possible for you to survive on that leg. You said that selling your body is worse than dying, and working to make ends meet is the only thing you can do. Cutting off your leg and ordering a prosthetic leg for you is all I can do for you.\u201dWhen Phoebe tried to express her gratitude with astonished eyes, Maribel raised her hand to silence her.\u201cI\u2019m about to do something very important right now. You don\u2019t have to be thankful, because it\u2019s a choice to make sure there\u2019s no unlucky thing involved.\u201dMaribel lifted Phoebe up. \u201cI\u2019ll call a doctor tomorrow, so go get some rest today.\u201d\u201cCan I still stay here for a while?\u201d Phoebe said anxiously, recalling the man who had brought the poison and the lady who had checked her death.\u201cThe master of the servant will only look at the fact that Mrs. Anais has confirmed someone\u2019s death today, so he has little interest in you. Likewise, Mrs. Anais has confirmed the death of the person she wanted to see dead, so there\u2019s nothing to be interested in here anymore.\u201dMaribel continued to speak, looking down at the carpet stained with brown liquid, \u201cShe doesn\u2019t care a bit about you, but if she finds out that I\u2019ve deceived her by the fact that you are still alive, I may disappear without a trace.\u201d\u201cWell, I\u2019ll be careful not to get caught. I will not move out of the room. If he comes in, I won\u2019t be caught hiding myself under the bed.\u201dAt Phoebe\u2019s desperate words, Maribel laughed, curling the corners of her eyes. \u201cI believe that you\u2019ll never forget what I risked saving you.\u201dMaribel then sent her back to her room. She picked up the small bottle on the table left after Phoebe drank it.When she looked into the bottle, she found that the mouth was narrower than the bottle and some remnant had been left behind. Maribel took the lid she had thrown on her desk, closed it tightly, and carefully put the bottle inside her secret stash.She thought she would find out what poison was in that bottle, and how Phoebe was able to survive, contrary to the servant\u2019s firm belief that she would die soon.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013After being ordered by the Duke, Julietta and her group left Tilia early in the morning and were able to make their way to Baden during the late hours of the night.As she went into her lodgings that night, Julietta looked at the inn opposite her. The inn was the one she had stayed a few months ago when she had followed Prince Killian to Bertino.Recalling the Prince who was arrogant, mean, and capricious, but still had a kind and friendly side, Julietta glanced at Simone, one of her new employers. Seeing her hand wrapped around her forehead, she had to admit that the Prince was a pretty good man for an employer.\u201cKiellini mansion in Dublin is where Regina lived until she was five years old. But she has been sick since she was born, so she was almost always in bed, and it\u2019s like a strange place.\u201dSimone refused to eat and opened her mouth to tell Julietta what to do tomorrow. Looking at Simone ordering her maid to bring the tea, Julietta put down her fork.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Finish eating. As we continuously ran without taking a break all day, and ate with the food we packed from the mansion in Tilia, it would have been insufficient for you, who are much younger.\u201dWhen Julietta looked at Simone\u2019s unusual behavior with an unknowingly angry look, Simone took a sip of Vera\u2019s Dureng tea and after putting it down, said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to look at it with those eyes. Isn\u2019t it natural for me, as an aunt, to worry about you? It\u2019s easy to be suspicious of people, if you look at everything with those big eyes.\u201dJulietta looked at Simone, who had picked up the teacup again, and picked up her fork again.Ever since Julietta had given her a massage on her shoulders and neck, she had been given a regular massage by Vera. Sometimes Julietta gave a massage to her to help Vera.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Francis, Part XIITranslator: KhanEditor: AelryinCertainly, since then, the amount of headache-removing tea she drank had declined significantly.She was sure it had worked. Simone\u2019s nervousness had decreased, and her attitude toward Julietta had changed greatly.Simone started talking about her future schedule over and over again, watching Julietta start eating without a word again.\u201cFirst of all, I have to get you a maid, but it\u2019ll take some time to get someone I can trust.\u201dJulietta recalled Dian when she heard about a maid. She was depressed when she said that she had to leave for the capital. But she was a maid brought by Sir Caden, and she couldn\u2019t ask Simone to take her just because she recommended her.\u201cYes, Aunt.\u201d\u201cVera will be waiting on you for the time being, so there will be no big problem, but it\u2019s also true that you need a maid your age, so let\u2019s hurry up and get her. Most aristocrats have maids of their own age.\u201dSimone looked across at Julietta eating dinner. Who would think that this child was not the daughter of the Duke of Kiellini? Rather, she looked more like the dead Katarina than her niece Regina, and it was horrifying. Concerned about whether her brother Duke Kiellini would be able to withstand that, Simone advised Julietta, \u201cWhen you go to Dublin and see the Duke, be courteous. Since Iris had no interaction with the people of the mansion when she went down to Tilia Territory when she was young, everyone understands her relationship with the Duke. I don\u2019t want you to incur his anger with behavior that goes too far, just to prove your relationship with the Duke.\u201dJulietta understood what Simone meant. She said, \u201cDon\u2019t forget the reality because you are in the role of a princess.\u201d She nodded politely and promised, \u201cYes. I will always keep in mind who I am.\u201dJulietta thought it was fortunate that she didn\u2019t have to act cute to him, thinking the Duke was as cold as ice.\u2018Now that I\u2019m back in Dublin, I should move on to implement my plans for the future.\u2019Julietta calculated the money she had received as a deposit and her salary for two months after taking the role of a princess.Judging from the attitude of the Duke or Simone, if she made her debut and showed her face in public, they would announce her as the successor and send her down to Tilia as soon as possible. If she were lucky, she would be released safely and get freedom. However, the Duke of Kiellini could try to kill her and eliminate any anxiety without caring about a nobleman\u2019s honor.Julietta gave up the simple dream of first paying Maribel back and then going down to the countryside to open her store. It wasn\u2019t time for her to be idle in the countryside, as her life depended on it.\u2018I have to go find Lillian first. Lillian is the only person I know who is acquainted with nobles.\u2019Julietta nodded gently to Simon\u2019s continuing sermon, thinking of ways to save her life after all this.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\u201cThis time, I thought we\u2019d go back to Austern through the Magic Square.\u201dKillian stared at Oswald, who had been grumbling since he told him to come along, but he followed.Unlike the other aristocrats who returned to Austern one by one after the hunting competition, Christine showed no signs of leaving the castle of Calen. To separate from Christine, who wanted to return to Austern with him, Killian had to escape the castle by running away under the cover of darkness, on the pretext that something urgent had happened.It was Adam who missed the chance to run away this time, as Oswald didn\u2019t want to deal with the remaining Lady Anais, and he and Prince Francis quickly followed Killian\u2019s lead.\u201cThank you, Your Excellency.\u201d Valerian thanked Oswald who never forgot to take care of him and bring him along.\u201cWell, it\u2019s a natural thing to do. Think of how we struggled and suffered under Lady Anais and Viscountess Morbido, as Adam fled. It\u2019s his turn this time.\u201dStaring disapprovingly at the two facing each other and chatting, Killian threw the documents he was reviewing on the table.\u201cEverybody said they didn\u2019t see anyone like her, so is she up in the sky or is she off to the ground?\u201d\u2018Who in the world would have disguised her as a dead woman to get a maid out?\u2019Killian was beginning to get irritated by the slow search.\u201cWe added a lot of people to those who might be suspicious, including Prince Francis or Lady Anais, Baroness Lanolf, and the Duke of Kiellini, but there was nothing.\u201dAt Valerian\u2019s words, Oswald soothingly followed his words carefully, \u201cWe have no choice but to visit the actress, Lillian, for now. Maybe she\u2019s been contacted by Julietta.\u201dSpencer, a member of the royal family, could hardly send a man to Lillian, who had been brought in as an official lover. No matter how wild Killian was, he was not able to fling himself about in anger at his cousin\u2019s woman, so he finally decided to drop by with Spencer on his way back to Austern.\u201cDon\u2019t say any useless words like \u2018I\u2019m dizzy or it\u2019s a rule that a noble gets up late\u2019, because I will be leaving as soon as Spencer gets back tomorrow morning. If you do, I\u2019m going to take you apart this time.\u201dSpencer was invited to a dinner by the lord and went to Baden Castle. When Killian had thrown away the invitation letter, which must have been sent as a courtesy, Spencer had sighed and gone to see Count Baden instead.When Killian blocked Oswald\u2019s late-morning recited excuse in advance, Oswald entered the bedroom, and Valerian sprang up. The sight of Oswald, who seemed more and more uncomfortable after arriving at the inn, made him think he\u2019d better get ready to start tomorrow on time. He quickly began to organize the papers in front of Oswald.\u201cYou\u2019d better go to bed, Your Excellency. If you wake up late tomorrow, he may explode.\u201dOswald grumbled as Valerian quickly cleared the papers and pulled him up. \u201cWe\u2019ll find Julietta at all costs. It\u2019s getting harder with each passing day. Why does this kind of thing always happen to me?\u201dOswald understood why Albert smacked his waist every day. He had no choice but to say that, to serve the Prince closely.Valerian safely took Oswald to his room, turned around, and muttered, \u201cI really need to turn the whole continent upside down and find her.\u201dListening to his followers grumbling outside, Killian lay on the bed where he had stayed before and looked down at the floor on the left. When he told her to sleep on the floor to stop the assassins from coming in at night, Julietta was dumbfounded and laid on top of the blanket, he remembered.\u2018Where did you disappear to?\u2019Killian looked down at his hands. He felt like he had been holding a strange and cute cat in his arms, and he missed it. He vowed, clasping his hands, and looking down with a greater sense of loss than he had thought.\u2018If I find her again, I\u2019ll never let her go\u2026\u2019\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-The next day, Killian was ready to leave early and asked Albert while getting on the ready wagon, \u201cAre you all ready?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019ll be down soon.\u201dKillian was supposed to head to the outskirts of Badan Territory, where the Magic Square was, with the unmarked black wagon he had been riding in from Bertino to avoid public attention.Count Baden was a border defenseman who got a report from the border and immediately found out about the Prince\u2019s visit and sent an invitation letter, as he did yesterday, but other aristocrats were bound to come to see his carriage. There were quite a few ladies and aristocrats who walked around in front of his usual quarters to pretend they had met by chance.Killian wanted to hurry back to Dublin and did not want to be disturbed by the aristocrats he would meet while doing so. Avoiding the hassle thanks to the wagon without an emblem, Killian leisurely climbed into the carriage and waited for the others.Killian laughed as Oswald followed him into the carriage.\u201cYour Highness, I\u2019m not late.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Francis, Part XIIITranslator: KhanEditor: AelryinHe seemed to be in a hurry. It was strange to see alone his cravats hanging helplessly and his jacket collar rolled inside; his usual peacock of a figure had gone away.As Killian looked at the sad scene and wondered if Oswald\u2019s servant saw him, he would be embarrassed, Oswald was staring out of the window in a daze. He suddenly jumped up and began clapping his hands.\u201cYour Highness, look over there. She\u2019s a great beauty. This Oswald, with the perfect aesthetic eye, is astounding. She\u2019s a flawless beauty.\u201dAt Oswald\u2019s admiration, even Valerian looked out the window they were sitting next to.\u201cThat is the Duke of Kiellini\u2019s wagon, isn\u2019t it?\u201dOswald, preoccupied with a beauty and unable to see the emblem of the carriage she was climbing, exclaimed in surprise, \u201cIt\u2019s a real emblem of the family of Kiellini! Then that lady?\u201dOswald\u2019s guess was not wrong, as the next Territory was Tilia.The image of the two men clinging to the carriage window and looking frantically out was well worth seeing. Killian\u2019s eyes naturally turned out of the window, but all he could see was a light green wagon.\u201cIt looks like the princess in the news is finally coming out. If we go to Dublin, we\u2019ll have to see her many times, so just sit up straight. I\u2019m afraid someone\u2019s going to see what you\u2019re doing.\u201dThe two were embarrassed by Killian\u2019s scolding, and returned to their seats quickly.As curious as the rumors about Princess Kiellini were, Killian was just sitting there stonily. Oswald looked at the Killian and shook his head. It was because he felt sorry for Killian, who had such an elusive taste, for the first time.\u201cIt\u2019s Marquise Raban. She\u2019s exactly like I saw her when I was a kid. I think she is going to Dublin with the princess.\u201dAt Oswald\u2019s words, Killian looked out the window. A silver-haired lady in a calm gray dress was leaving the inn and climbing into the carriage.\u201cSince the death of the Duchess of Kiellini, she\u2019s raised the princess like a daughter, so I\u2019m sure she\u2019s following her.\u201dWhile Killian recalled the relationship between the current Marquis of Raban and the family of Duke Kiellini, the curtains of the carriage across the street opened and the princess showed herself.As soon as she got into the carriage, Simone felt a pressure on her chest and told Julietta to open the curtain of the window. Killian\u2019s eyes, casually staring at the Duke\u2019s carriage, ran across the eyes of Julietta. Killian\u2019s expression slightly distorted as he watched her bright green eyes pop out in the morning sun.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Your Highness?\u201d Oswald was looking at Killian in anticipation of an outpouring of admiration. His lord was instead looking at the carriage across the street with a frown.\u201cYou said Princess Kiellini has never been in the capital since she went down to Tilia as a child?\u201d\u201cYes, Your Highness. That\u2019s why she has become the hottest subject of the year, as there has been talk about her debut with no one who\u2019s seen her.\u201dAt Oswald\u2019s answer, Killian was still thinking. \u201cBut why was she surprised as soon as she saw me, as if she saw a ghost?\u201d\u201cWas she surprised to see Your Highness?\u201d\u201cHerer eyes were sticking out.\u201dOswald tilted his head at Killian\u2019s words, slammed his knees and raised his voice. \u201cIsn\u2019t it because you\u2019re amazingly handsome? When we saw the princess earlier, our hearts almost popped out.\u201dAt Oswald\u2019s answer, Valerian nodded agreement.\u201cHow wonderful you must have been to the eyes of the princess who has lived in Tilia Territory. Oh, this Oswald has another worry. If even Princess Kiellini wants to marry you, how can you stop them from fighting?\u201dNo one wanted to give a piece of cake, but Oswald who tasted the soup first was worried about it, so Killian answered, \u201cIt\u2019s natural. The Duke of Kiellini would be better than the Marquis of Anais.\u201dNo one in the room felt strange to see Killian proud or unashamed, even though his appearance was praised. Killian himself knew his good-natured men too well, and because it was true, no one in the carriage felt alienated.Killian began to calculate the advantages of marrying Princess Kiellini.He intended to make a cage, the most splendid and safe of all in the castle, so that he wouldn\u2019t lose Julietta again. To do so, the largest force needed to brighten the path toward the goal and flatten it to walk comfortably. Killian decided that the Duke of Kiellini, who had expressed his support for him, would be better than the Marquis of Anais, who was tangled with Francis.\u2014\u2014While Killian was thinking about something that wouldn\u2019t happen, Julietta quickly lowered the curtain again and took a deep breath to calm her fluttering heart.\u201cWhat are you doing? Open the curtain.\u201dJulietta was forced to open the curtain again at Simone\u2019s angry word. Fortunately, as her carriage had left, the carriage with the Prince on the opposite side was moving away. There was no way he could recognize her, but she breathed a sigh of relief.Julietta leaned back after checking out the window to see if the Prince was following her again, and smiled awkwardly as her eyes met Vera, who was staring at her carefully. As Vera stared at Julietta\u2019s suspicious behavior, she glanced at Simone opposite her who was not aware of anything.\u2018Who was on the other carriage? Why was she so surprised?\u2019Not knowing of Killian\u2019s face, she felt uneasy for Julietta, who had been so frightened to see the man in the carriage across from her.\u2018She seems to know him. What kind of relationship does she have?\u2019Vera looked at the girl opposite her once again, showing off her impeccably brilliant beauty. She wondered if things would go as planned by His Excellency and her madame.She was anxious, praying that nothing would happen, and everything would be done safely.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-The next afternoon, Julietta arrived at the Kiellini mansion on Eldira Street, facing the Imperial Castle. At the entrance of the magnificent mansion were the residents of the mansion, welcoming the princess who regained her health and returned after a few years.Finally, when the carriage stopped, Julietta looked at the endless line of people in the street and tried to hide her discomfort.Even though it was their job to meet their master, who had been away for a long time and returned, she could not help but have a guilty conscience. She thought it was Regina in Tilia Territory who should receive sincere greetings from those who were waiting for joy.\u201cRaise your head. From now on, you are Iris Kiellini,\u201d Simone pressed Julietta, who seemed to be nervous.The rebuke made her realize that the curtain on the stage was rising now. Funnily enough, in Tilia Territory, Mrs. Raban was her greatest enemy, but now she was an ally to trust and rely on. She didn\u2019t know how long this symbiotic relationship would last, but she had to get her head on straight to get off this dangerous stage safely.Julietta nodded to Simone, who was sitting opposite her, and took a deep breath, waiting for the carriage door to open.\u201cCome here, my lady. Welcome back to Dublin.\u201dThe elderly butler greeted Julietta who was coming down with a knight\u2019s hand, and the residents greeted her with big bows.\u201cWelcome back, my lady.\u201dIn Tilia, she was also treated as a lady, not comparable to the time when she was an employee. However, the number of people who came down from the capital was very small, and she was almost always in her room at Simone\u2019s command, so they rarely had to be met. Therefore, this kind of polite and courteous greeting made her feel strange.The content had not changed, but Julietta, who had been a fat, ugly maid, and herself, who was now a great noble princess, were being treated so differently.\u201cThank you for your hospitality.\u201dJulietta decided to forget her restless thoughts, and simply reciprocated the greetings and moved on. When she arrived at the door carved with the splendid family emblem of Kiellini, the voice of Simone rang out around the mansion, as she walked along the inconvenient path lined with people on both sides.\u201cWhere is my brother?\u201d Simone looked back at the butler who had followed them, indicating the empty doorway.\u201cHis Excellency went down to Tilia Territory after he got an urgent message. He left just before you arrived.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Francis, Part XIVTranslator: KhanEditor: AelryinthSimone\u2019s expression hardened at the butler\u2019s words. Her hands trembled at the behavior of the Duke, who had apparently gone down to the Territory to avoid Julietta. She was furious that the person who had formed the scheme was just running away, leaving everything to her.From the time he had left for Dublin without dropping by Tilia on his way back from Bertino, she had known his intentions, but she never thought he would act this way until today. Simone said, barely managing to settle down, \u201cHe must have left in a hurry to finish the chores before the debut party. There is nothing to do myself. Even if Iris is healthy, she would be tired because it\u2019s the first time she\u2019s come such a long way. Take her right to her room.\u201dSimone entered the mansion, carefully covering Julietta\u2019s back.\u201cI\u2019ll tell them to take your dinner up to the bedroom. Since my brother is not at home anyway, you are going to have a comfortable meal in your room for now.\u201dSimone sat down in a chair by the window, ordering Vera to change Julietta\u2019s suit. She beckoned Julietta to come near, then whispered into her ear, \u201cEveryone around you, except me and Vera, is your enemy. The people in the mansion will be glad to greet the princess who has returned after a long time, but the moment they are not satisfied with you, they\u2019ll look down on you and ignore you.\u201dThe commoners working in the highest aristocracy of Austern were as proud and arrogant as their masters. Their loyalty varied in depth depending on how dignified, wonderful, and fine their master was.It was quite different from the naive servants and maids of Tilia Territory. It didn\u2019t make sense for the master to notice their subordinates, but the story was quite different for those who were stuck in a land, like Simone and Regina. The fact that the Duke was not here today without waiting for his daughter\u2019s return made Iris\u2019 position especially uneasy.Julietta nodded at Simone\u2019s reminder and looked around the room where she would stay.The rooms of the princess, located on the right side of the second floor, consisted of three spaces. Divided into a dressing room, bedroom with a bathroom, reception room, and study, the space was decorated with light sky blue and white, making it well suited for a girl who was doing her coming-out ceremony.Although she was a substitute, she was now the princess who was qualified to stay in a room like this. But Julietta sighed\u2026 everything was still as precarious as thin ice.Vera took out a dress for wearing inside from the bag the servant had picked and began to take off Julietta\u2019s traveling clothes. Simone looked carefully at Julietta changing into an indoor dress and said to Vera, \u201cWe\u2019ll have to get her clothes ready right now. Maybe it\u2019s because it\u2019s the dress we prepared in a hurry, but it doesn\u2019t deserve the status of Princess Kiellini, either.\u201dThe maids of the family of the Duke would gossip about everything concerning the princess. Even if their chatter was suppressed, it could not prevent their own judgment.\u201cWe\u2019ll have to hurry up and prepare, but she\u2019s too well-developed for a child who\u2019s been sick for a long time.\u201dMadame Louai had hurried to send a letter to Tilia Territory when the steady orders for Princess Kiellini\u2019s dresses were cut off with rumors of her debut. Her letter was congratulating the princess on her debut, saying that she was fully prepared for her debut dress. She had been in charge of the princess\u2019s wardrobe for a decade, so she was sure they\u2019d order the dress.However, it was not possible to assign clothes to Madame Louai, who knew Regina\u2019s measurements. No matter how much better and healthier she got, she couldn\u2019t change her measurements in two months.She tried to alter Regina\u2019s clothes and make them again with the same clothes, but that didn\u2019t make sense, either. When the princess had been in Tilia Territory, Madame Louai had sent the dress illustrations to her, and Regina had chosen one of the dresses she liked, then a maid of the mansion measured her and sent it to Madame Louai. It was strange that the princess who had come to Dublin didn\u2019t wear her own clothes.Simone sent a letter to Madame Louai saying the princess\u2019s debut dress would be made by a new designer. It was going to antagonize her further, but she couldn\u2019t help it.Madam Louai\u2019s self-respect had been damaged, and she would be watching the new designer for Princess Kiellini. They had to find a talented designer, which was also a concern. It would be a laughingstock if the newly found designer was poor after kicking out the best designer in Austern.\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to find a new designer as soon as possible, and that\u2019s a problem, too.\u201dSimone felt resentful of her narrow personal connections from being confined to Tilia Territory along with her niece. As her head ached again from anxiety that Julietta might be revealed and the pressure to have a successful debut party that would draw everyone\u2019s attention, Simone ordered tea to soothe her headache.Julietta carefully spoke up when she saw Simone. \u201cCan I get a trusted designer? I\u2019m afraid Madame Louai might ask a new designer about the princess of Kiellini and notice that her physical shape is different from the dresses she used to make.\u201dJulietta\u2019s body, which showed unusual development, and Regina, who was as thin as a child, were totally different. Simone sighed, comparing the two whose hair color and eye color were similar, and the differences in height, chest, hips, arms, and legs.\u201cIf we want to find a designer who\u2019s good at it and has no interaction with Madame Louai, we\u2019ll have to go to Vicern or another kingdom to order clothes.\u201dVera put the tea down and said, \u201cWouldn\u2019t it seem rather strange to go all the way to another country to order dresses, when all the fashions of the continent begin in Austern?\u201dSimone wrapped her head. \u201cIn this situation, no matter what you do, they\u2019ll think it\u2019s strange\u2026 unless you make your debut wearing a really great dress. Vera, send someone to the Eileen Theater tomorrow and make an appointment with Maribel. Since she has a good and broad personal connection, she might find the right person for the situation.\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Upon arriving in Austern, Killian visited Lillian with Spencer. He frowned as the carriage stopped at the mansion facing the Bertino mansion on Harrods Street.\u201cWhy did you get a mansion across the street?\u201dSpencer tilted his head at Killian\u2019s complaint. \u201cYou can\u2019t be afraid of people\u2019s eyes, and what don\u2019t you like about it?\u201dKillian glared at Spencer\u2019s questioning look. The mere thought of the two members of the royal family coming in a carriage and entering the mansions across from one other made him feel bad.As Spencer looked at him innocently, Killian murmured as if he had given up, \u201cWell, I\u2019ll dispose of it anyway, so I don\u2019t have to care if you come and go to the other side of the street.\u201d\u201cWill you dispose of your mansion?\u201dWhen Spencer asked in surprise, Killian said sharply, \u201cIt\u2019s of no use any more.\u201dAt the mere mention of it, Spencer watched his cousin\u2019s back as he stepped out of the open carriage door and muttered under his breath, \u201cYou don\u2019t even think you might not find her. Or don\u2019t you want to think of it?\u201dAfter Killian got off the wagon, he saw Lillian walking from the garden to greet them. Just like when she was an actress, Lillian was still beautiful despite her plain clothes and face without makeup.Unlike the always busy and bustling theater life, the quiet and calm present life was fine for her, but there were times when she felt lonely. People\u2019s amorous glances and attention were exhausting, but she missed the time after the performance, when she exchanged views with actors and staff about the play of the day, or laughed and chatted with employees.Not surprised by the sudden visit of the Prince, she guided them to the drawing-room and served them tea.\u201cWhy are you looking for Julietta?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to take her as a concubine.\u201dAt Killian\u2019s imposing declaration, Lillian took a sip of the tea she was holding, and then put it down. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen her since she followed you to Bertino. It\u2019s rather embarrassing that you asked me where Julietta was.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Who would want to miss such a lovely and charming child?\u201dBy saying so, Lillian cautiously wondered how far Killian had seen through Julietta\u2019s disguise.\u201cLovely and charming\u2026 When my aides hear that, they are going to be surprised and faint.\u201dAt Killian\u2019s reply, Lillian smiled quietly to hide her inner thoughts.It was unclear whether the Prince knew her true appearance. His aides did not think Julietta was attractive, but she looked back at the Prince because he seemed to know her charm. His expressionless face did not reveal what he thought.Lillian wondered how far she should speak. \u201cJulietta\u2019s charm doesn\u2019t just come from her looks. Now that you\u2019ve recognized Julie\u2019s hidden charm, aren\u2019t you trying to put her into a precious position?\u201dKillian smiled at Lillian\u2019s words. It wasn\u2019t a reproachable answer, but it was a nerve-wracking one.Actually, he wasn\u2019t attracted to Julietta\u2019s appearance, so Lillian wasn\u2019t wrong. But it was suspicious for her to drink tea as if to buy time before answering questions. As she was a quiet character, she might be careful about her answers to the Prince, but for some reason she seemed to be picking her answers\u2026\u201cFrom when did Julietta grow up in the theater?\u201dKillian was watching her closely, so Lillian lowered her nervous hands under the table to avoid being caught. \u201cI don\u2019t know that well. I\u2019ve only seen her running errands since my first day. There are many children in the theater. We collect orphaned children who have no place to go to make actors and workers in the future.\u201d\u201cJulietta said she was in disguise, because she didn\u2019t want to go through rough things in the theater. Didn\u2019t you know about the child\u2019s disguise? Do other kids stay that way in disguise?\u201dWhen she was asked the direct question by Killian, Lillian began to busily roll her head.\u2018He knew that she was disguised, and it means that she was caught in the act, but he said that his aides would laugh at Julietta for being attractive. So others don\u2019t know who Julietta is, but does he know?\u2019It was so difficult to deal with the Prince without any information that Lillian wanted to let go. But it seemed clear that Julietta had turned down the Prince\u2019s offer, so she needed to figure out how much he knew.He was none other than the Prince, but Julietta had run away after refusing to accept the offer from the imperial family, so she thought she should help Julietta somehow.She concluded that it would be better not to talk about Julietta\u2019s past. Julietta, who had nowhere to go, might entrust herself to Marquis Anais.\u201cWell, it depends on the child\u2019s disposition. No one protects them, but they don\u2019t force them to do what they don\u2019t like. I don\u2019t know what she\u2019s been through since she was a child. You asked me if I knew she was in disguise? Yes, I knew. But I didn\u2019t care about it or ask about it in detail. Each person\u2019s life was exhausting and busy. All I did for Julietta was to introduce her to a job because she wanted to get out of the theater.\u201d\u201cYou have no idea of what Julietta\u2019s past is or where she could go?\u201d\u201cCorrect, Your Highness.\u201dLillian\u2019s words made Killian stand up, judging that he had nothing more to dig out. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since we met, so I\u2019d better leave you alone. Do you mind if I send someone to ask you something next time?\u201dWhen he said he would come back if anything suspicious was found, Lillian replied freely, while her heart pounded, \u201cYes, Your Highness. I\u2019ll tell you everything I know.\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-7. DebutDays after returning to Dublin was Princess Kiellini\u2019s first outing. She visited the Eileen Theater to see the opera with her aunt, Marquise Raban.The long-lost princess had announced that even after returning to Dublin, she would refuse all invitations until she made a formal debut in society. The outing of such a veiled princess of Kiellini was naturally a matter of great interest. People rushed to book a performance for the night.Upon entering the hall of the Eileen Theater, Julietta lowered the hood of the cloak she was wearing to keep away the eyes of the crowd. Simone\u2019s orders were not to be seen as much as possible before her official debut.Christine, who had just returned from Austern, was among those looking at Princess Kiellini, who went straight into the VIP seat under the heavy escort of some knights.\u201cI guess it\u2019s true that there\u2019s a nasty blot on the princess\u2019s face.\u201d\u201cThey said it was from a disease? That\u2019s terrible.\u201d\u201cI heard Madame Louai has never seen the princess in person.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate. She can\u2019t help but show up in society because she has to succeed the Duke.\u201dAs the lady of Count Patrick, the center of social rumors and a social butterfly, whispered at the appearance from behind of Princess Kiellini, the ladies around her began to bring up stories they had heard from one another.It was a time when strange rumors began to spread over the actions of the princess. She had not been seen even after returning to Dublin, even while refusing invitations from various sources.The ladies, curious about the soon-to-be rival Princess Kiellini, rushed to the dressing room of Madame Louai, who was in charge of her wardrobe. Rumors gained weight when Madame Louai, who had prepared the princess\u2019s clothes for more than ten years, said she had never seen the princess herself.Regina was thought to be very vain, and was rumored to have been living in hiding because of an ugly mole on her face. The whole thing started because Regina did not want to reveal her frail, lifeless appearance to the public, and confined herself in the Territory without showing herself.\u201cLady Anais, aren\u2019t you a cousin of the princess? It\u2019s been a while since you\u2019ve met. Shouldn\u2019t you say hello to her?\u201dThe ladies who wanted to see the ugly princess\u2019s face began to urge Christine.\u2014Christine had hurried away from Bertino after Killian headed straight to the Imperial Castle, returning to Austern. She thought that since she was so close to him in Bertino, she would be able to exchange greetings. But the only words delivered to her after she visited Killian\u2019s castle was a formal reply that he was not receiving visitors.Christine, a niece of the first Queen, was denied by Prince Killian after going to the castle of Asta. The humiliation that Christine had suffered was likely to spread throughout the social world soon. Christine, her pride stung, turned around, still determined to marry Killian.Believing that she could not let her relationship with the Prince, which had been thought to have grown closer, slip away again, she moved assiduously to meet him as soon as she heard that Marquis Rhodius was scheduled to visit the Eileen Theater today.As the Marquis moved with Killian, she would ask him about the Prince and learn what he had been saying about her. Also, it was necessary to show today that she was close to the Prince\u2019s close friend, the Marquis of Rhodius, to appease the rejection after going as far as Asta Castle.After calculating about so many situations, Christine, who had been wandering the hall to look for the Marquis. ran into the young ladies who had booked the theater in a hurry to see Princess Kiellini.\u2014They knew that Christine had followed Prince Killian to Bertino, so they began sneering at her. As high society\u2019s unique shattering attacks were being brought forth, Princess Kiellini entered the room alone.Lady Patrick and other ladies realized that they would be in the spotlight if they met Princess Kiellini today. They changed their derisive attitude and began to flatter their target, thinking of following Christine when she went to greet her cousin, the princess.\u201cThat\u2019s right, Lady Anais. You must have been worried about Princess Kiellini\u2019s illness, right? It must be nice of you to meet her like this.\u201d\u201cWell, I\u2019m just back in Austern, so I just want to enjoy my favorite opera quietly today. I am her cousin, as you say. We can meet at any time, so it\u2019s better to promise next time than to say hello in such an uncomfortable place.\u201dChristine nodded an arrogant greeting to the young ladies who had quickly changed their attitudes and turned toward her box seat.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She was now in a state of nobility, as she sat there with no response, only nodding her head when seen.Maribel, like an artist who appreciated her work, turned her gaze away after seeing Julietta with satisfaction and answered Simone\u2019s question, \u201cThe secret is that the less people know, the better. Even if I knew a talented designer, I can\u2019t be sure if I could trust her or if she won\u2019t betray us later.\u201dAt Maribel\u2019s answer, Simone frowned\u2026\u201cSo, you can\u2019t get a designer? Why didn\u2019t you tell me this in your reply? We didn\u2019t have to come this far for nothing?\u201dAt Simone\u2019s anger, Maribel looked at Julietta.\u201cI wanted to see Princess Kiellini. She\u2019s a valuable person, and without making excuses, it would be hard to see her face.\u201dMaribel\u2019s gentle voice hardened Simone\u2019s face. \u201cYou are curious about my niece, so I\u2019ll forgive you just this time. But I won\u2019t let you go if you do this next time.\u201dMaribel bowed politely at Simone\u2019s cold words. \u201cYes, the Marquise. But in order to celebrate her debut in society, I prepared a gift. Will you take it?\u201d\u201cGift?\u201dWhen she said it was a gift, Julietta looked down as if she were curious. Maribel gave Julietta as sweet a smile as she could, looking at her.\u201cThe most urgent thing right now is to find a designer for the princess.\u201dSimone burst into the anger she had held back at Maribel\u2019s back and forth words.\u201cAre you trying to play with me? Didn\u2019t you just say it\u2019s hard to find a reliable designer?\u201d\u201cIf I want to find her, there\u2019s nothing I can\u2019t find. I just don\u2019t feel the need to do that.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t understand what the hell you\u2019re talking about. Just get to the point.\u201dLooking at Simone who was deeply irritated, Maribel took a breath and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to find a designer far away, because Julietta is a better designer than anyone.\u201d\u201cThis child makes clothes?\u201dThe sudden words made Simone look back at Julietta. Julietta fluttered her hand at the gazes of Simone and Maribel.\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous. Since I grew up in the theater\u2019s prop room, I\u2019ve learned something over the shoulder, but I\u2019ve never finished the right clothes.\u201d Julietta said, shaking her head, losing the appearance of Princess Kiellini.\u201cYou\u2019ve been good at drawing dresses since you were a child. I\u2019ve seen Amelie and Sophie admiring your designs many times. All you\u2019ve ever seen is stage costumes and the way actresses decorate to greet their guests, and they say it\u2019s amazing how you draw such things.\u201d\u2018It\u2019s what I had seen in all the media back in the twenty-first century.\u2019 Young Julietta growing up in the theater had a soul in her twenties, but when bored was just like any other kid.All she could enjoy in a theater with no games, no TV, and no novels was watching an opera that was not fit for her tastes or going to the makeup room of the actresses to see the dresses. It was a rare pleasure to spend time drawing pretty clothes according to her imagination.\u201cI know you want to open the dressing shop when you save money later, baby.\u201dThe word \u2018baby\u2019 from Maribel raised Simone\u2019s eyebrows at once. But she didn\u2019t refute the words that followed.\u201cI\u2019ll send you Amelie and Sophie. They\u2019re the ones who\u2019ve been trying to avoid my eyes and somehow give you something better, and you needn\u2019t worry about their betrayal since they raised you.\u201dThe day after the Marquise had warned her about the illegitimate child as she had taken away Stella\u2019s body, Maribel had thought about Julietta\u2019s future. The two women had asked Maribel, burdened by the warnings of Mrs. Anais ordering that Julietta should never be identified, not to kick out Julietta, since they would raise her in the prop room.It was Amelie and Sophie who had been taking care of the child for nearly a year, instead of Stella who had been lying in bed without energy since she returned to the theater. At the strong request of the two, who were very affectionate to the astute Julietta, Maribel let the child leave of her living quarters in the theater and put her in disguise.Maribel looked at Julietta, her eyes glistening at the suggestion that she would send Amelie and Sophie over, and said, \u201cPlease open a small but luxurious dressing shop with a proper name. It\u2019s also good to make her face invisible. Julietta can put Amelie and Sophie in the dressing shop and have them make a dress for her to wear. Amelie and Sophie\u2019s skills are excellent when compared to the average tailors in other dressing shops. If you don\u2019t want Julietta\u2019s secrets to leak out, how much more perfect could this dressing shop be?\u201dAt Maribel\u2019s words, Simone was lost in thought for a moment. As she said, there was no better way to keep a secret than this.Simone felt goosebumps on her arms as she looked at Maribel smiling confidently. She was a formidable woman. She was a woman that she should not be an enemy. Fearing whether it was a good thing to get on the same boat, Simone stood up. There was no way she could do anything about it now anyway.\u201cI\u2019ll do as you say. I\u2019ll send someone as soon as I\u2019m ready.\u201dWhen Simone left the box, Julietta whispered quickly to Maribel, \u201cAren\u2019t you worried that I won\u2019t be able to pay you back?\u201d\u201cBaby, I\u2019m sorry I racked my brains for you.\u201dOf course, Maribel\u2019s suggestion was not bad. Furthermore, she was glad to hear that she would send Amelie and Sophie. However, she was only nervous about why she made such a proposal for.\u201cOh, of course, it\u2019s important to get my money, too. But now you have a very good chance. And while you\u2019ve got that good opportunity, it\u2019s not bad to be a little more greedy.\u201dMaribel patted Julietta\u2019s cheek with her fingers and bent her eyes.\u201cGo ahead, before you get scolded by the Marquise. And whenever you have time, drop by the theater as an excuse at the opera. When you were working on Harrods Street, I could still see you once a month, but it wasn\u2019t easy to see your face after you went to Bertino.\u201dJulietta sighed as if she had given up and turned away, thinking that she could say she didn\u2019t want to see her often. It was because she knew Maribel had affection for her, though it changed according to her mood. As that affection was shallow, she never knew when it would change.After Julietta fell into a strange world, the Eileen Theater was her home and hometown, and Maribel and her troupe members were her family. Maribel was selfish for her own benefit, but Julietta still believed she wouldn\u2019t hurt her.\u2014\u2014Inside the carriage returning from the theater, Simone told Vera, \u201cVera, tell Gibson tomorrow to find the right place for a dressing shop.\u201dJulietta had been running her head busily ever since she heard Maribel\u2019s suggestion. After saving some money, it was her dream to go down to a quiet country village and open a small dressing shop. She was going to ask Amelie and Sophie to come with her then, but it was thrilling to see the opportunity come so fast.Julietta, who now thought she should make this unexpected opportunity as favorable to her as possible, said to Simone, \u201cCan I check out the store?\u201d\u201cYou?\u201d\u201cYes. I think it\u2019s too much for Gibson, the driver, to find the right store for this situation right now. Since it\u2019s going to be the dressing shop for Princess Kiellini\u2019s wardrobe, it needs to be luxurious and elegant, as well as not noticeable. That is not a typical store.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. Do you think it makes sense that Princess Kiellini goes around looking for a dressing shop? No matter how careful you are, you could catch people\u2019s eyes.\u201d\u201cOf course, I can\u2019t walk around in the form of a princess. There\u2019s a wig I used to dress up in. If I wore that wig and borrowed Vera\u2019s gown, who would think I was Princess Kiellini?\u201dAt Julietta\u2019s words, Simone was lost in thought for a moment. She was sure that it would be better than leaving it to Gibson.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Debut, Part IIITranslator: KhanEditor: AelryinSimone decided to ignore what the Duke would think about this. She felt uncomfortable that he stood back after making this plan.Simone was awakened by the thought, like a sudden slap on the head. Maybe the Duke was trying to avoid them as he prepared for emergencies, in case this plan was detected? Of course, it would be a ridiculous imagination, but it might be true if he didn\u2019t return to Dublin before her debut party.Simone stared at Julietta, still glinting at her eyes and unable to hide her feelings.As her doubts grew, it was dumbfounding to see that this child who she had not met long ago was more reliable than her brother whose thoughts she did not know. When a difficult thing happened, people said that they would learn the truth of the people around them, and she thought that was the situation now.Her niece, whom she had devoted herself in her youth, often did not believe in her and was hysterical to her. On the morning of her departure for Dublin, what Regina had said to her when she had visited her to say goodbye, hurt her feelings whenever she had time to think about it.\u2014\u201cI won\u2019t believe you\u2019ll betray my faith, aunt.\u201dShe could no longer believe her tearful niece\u2019s appearance, as she had changed beyond recognition in two months.\u201cBetray your faith? What are you talking about?\u201d\u201cI wonder if you are thinking of using Julietta to make me a permanent shadow and gain the power of the family of the Duke in your hands.\u201d\u201cRegina, how can you suspect such a thing? I\u2019m your aunt, who\u2019s been taking care of you all these years!\u201dDespite Simone\u2019s anger at the outrageous suspicion, Regina had not changed a single bit.\u201cYes. Because you are my aunt, I have entrusted you with this dangerous task, which can destroy the family. But since that girl came into the mansion, your behavior has changed a lot.\u201d\u201cChanged a lot?\u201d\u201cI feel like you are too comfortable with her. That girl is the one that is going to be used as a substitute and thrown away. But what if you treat her so humanely and she gets the wrong idea? I have begun to doubt your gentle behavior.\u201dSimone was furious at Regina\u2019s words. \u201cHow can you say such a thing to me, who have confined myself in this countryside and raised you for so long?\u201dSimone was disappointed with the doubts about her and spoke as if she was dumbfounded, but Regina continued as if she could not understand what Simone was saying.\u201cYou didn\u2019t mean it of your own. I understand that my aunt who had nowhere to go returned to the family of Duke Kiellini under the condition of taking over me because you lost your husband and was pushed out because of friction with the new Marquis Raban.\u201dSimone smiled bitterly. Even though she was able to remarry enough, she felt sorry for her niece who was young and ill, and devoted her youth to raising and taking care of her, but this was how all her efforts were returned.Of course, she would be lying if she didn\u2019t expect that she would be compensated for her love and efforts when Regina grew up. It was true that she wanted to seize and shake the inside power of the family of the Duke who was without a hostess, but she couldn\u2019t say she had no affection for her little niece who had lost her mother.All he had ever believed in was a delusion, and Simone, who had become thoroughly absent-minded, had given up on talking.This meant that Regina was wary of her. If Julietta made her debut safely and they announced her as the successor of the family of Duke Kiellini, it would be like a declaration of war to regain her power as the hostess for outside affairs.Simon said to the staring Iris with a forced smile, \u201cWe\u2019ll only get disappointed in one another if we say more. I understand what you\u2019re trying to say. But I think you\u2019ve forgotten that if this goes wrong, it\u2019ll be a big problem for me, too. I\u2019m also from the family of Kiellini. So, don\u2019t worry about such a useless thing.\u201dSimone rose with her emotions hidden and kissed Regina on the cheek with an expressionless face. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get going. I have to get to Baden by evening. When I come back, I will see you, who will be the successor to the family of Duke Kiellini. I\u2019ll be back.\u201dSimone momentarily quenched her agitated feelings, recalling the situation at that time. Then she nodded to Julietta, who was looking at her with an expectant face.\u201cYes, I got it. It would be best if you were not caught by people.\u201dAs soon as Simone agreed, Julietta quickly opened her mouth again. \u201cI have one more thing to say. Please change the name of the owner of the building I\u2019m looking for, instead of the salary and severance pay you\u2019ll give me.\u201dSimone frowned at the impertinent demand, but Julietta did not care at all. \u201cI know you\u2019re worried I have another motive. But this will prove that I have no intention of doing so. If you give me the building for the dressing shop, as soon as I finish my job as a substitute for the princess, I\u2019ll live my life as a faceless designer in that shop. So, it\u2019s good for you and His Excellency to be able to keep an eye on me nearby, and I can have a stable future, so isn\u2019t it good for one another?\u201dSimone abandoned her passive attitude and looked at Julietta, who was now actively making demands. Definitely, her words were right. This girl knew exactly what they were worried about. Simone looked at Julietta thoughtfully for a long time.She was not sure how the Duke would handle this girl after this was over. Maybe his personality wouldn\u2019t have allowed Julietta to roam her way. It was not a bad thing for her brother if she said she would hide her identity and be under their watch. Simone finally nodded.\u201cI\u2019ll do what you say. As the role of a designer has been added to the role you\u2019ve taken as a substitute, it is a natural reward. Try to choose an expensive building. That\u2019s not a heavy burden on the Duke.\u201dSimone was willing to show good faith, rebelling against the Duke who had entrusted her with everything. She must take care of everything since he had gone down to Tilia at this critical time. Fine, then!As Simone even gave advice to her, asking her to choose an expensive building, she seemed to be a different person than her usual cold expression. When Julietta stared blankly at the woman, Simone\u2019s face returned to its original form.\u201cYour debut is a month away, so we\u2019ll have to hurry as fast as we can. Take Gibson and go tomorrow.\u201dJulietta replied with a bright smile when Simone turned her eyes out of the window and spoke stiffly, as if she could not smile, \u201cYes, aunt. I\u2019ll diligent to find out.\u201d***\u201cAmelie, Sophie, what do you think?\u201dIn just three days, Julietta was able to find a huge mansion on the outskirts of Eloz Street, which had its own style. It was a residence in an area that ran off from the main street, with Eileen Theater and other theaters, restaurants, luxury dressing shops and various shops nearby, and ran into Eldira Street. The choice was very easy, as she chose the house and furniture without caring about the amount.Originally a nobleman\u2019s mansion, the building consisted of a three-story main building and a two-story annex. Unlike the mansions of high-ranking aristocrats, it was a town house with no garden, a tall, narrow-looking house in the city\u2019s residential district. The entrance of the main house was shared with the side street and the carriage-storage area next to the main house, and a separate house after it.Amelie looked at the ivory-colored exterior and said anxiously as she stepped inside, \u201cThis is so nice. But is it okay to open a dressing shop in a place that\u2019s out of the business area? Besides, it\u2019s not a store, it\u2019s a mansion.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s basically a quiet place like this. We can enjoy the customers who will come to the corner.\u201d\u201cWhat if it doesn\u2019t work out?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m the designer who\u2019s going to make the debut dress for Princess Kiellini, who\u2019s currently in the spotlight in Austern. The power of the princess is so great that she\u2019ll be praised for going to the party wearing even an academy uniform.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Debut, Part IVTranslator: KhanEditor: AelryinthJulietta took Amelie and Sophie to the back of the building.\u201cYou two will stay here.\u201dThe two women were staying in the dorms in the theater. The annex attached to the main house was decorated as a house where they could stay. With less than a month left before her debut, she was in great haste to decorate the interior of the annex in three days. The two-story annex was with four bedrooms, one reception room, and kitchen, enough space for two.\u201cHere?\u201dWhen Amelie and Sophie asked, Julietta laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me, you don\u2019t think Maribel will let you stay here?\u201dShe did not tell Julietta, but Maribel had urged them to leave the theater. They recalled what had happened a few days ago.\u201cI advise you to go to Julietta, but if you are not employees of the theater, you can\u2019t stay in quarters in the theater. Find a separate place to live.\u201dThis was after Julietta suddenly called and asked if they would like to work with her if she would open a dressing shop. When they accepted the offer with a smile of joy, the boss pouted her lips and recommended they go.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Born to a poor family and married to a man of means. Sophie suffered a miscarriage while working too hard to make ends meet in her early pregnancy. When her husband was told she would never get pregnant again, he turned to another woman and kicked her out of the house.It was Amelie who brought Sophie to her home, after she fell down while wandering the streets after a miscarriage, without a chance to take care of herself,. She was a benefactor who saved Sophie from death.After Sophie recovered her health she began to learn sewing from Amelie. So, Sophie and Amelie got their hands on work from the Eileen Theater before Maribel took over, and the other surrounding theaters, and made or altered stage costumes.Amelie was living alone after losing her son to illness a few years ago. Since her husband left home a year ago and there was no news, Sophie and Amelie were forced to rely on each other.Then suddenly, the creditors came. Her husband who she hadn\u2019t heard from ran away with a gambling debt, and he was killed in an accident. Amelie lost her home overnight and was saddled with huge debts. It was Sophie who consoled Amelie, who was dying of gloom, and encouraged her. The new owner of the Eileen Theater put forward conditions to Amelie, who had just been forced to pull herself up.Maribel said she would change things by creating a prop room inside the theater, instead of getting the stage costumes from other places like other theaters, and she wanted Amelie to come and work in the prop room in her theater. From then on, Amelie worked with Sophie at the Eileen Theater.The owner of the theater, Maribel, was different from the ones they had seen before. Taking over the Eileen Theater, which was just such a normal theater, she broke down an annex next to the theater which was used as an empty warehouse, and put in staff accommodations there.Those who wanted to use the accommodations could do so at a certain amount of money off their salary. Most of the employees without families opted to stay in the staff quarters because it was much cheaper than buying a separate house. Amelie and Sophie had rented an inn room after being evicted from their homes, and quickly moved into the employee\u2019s quarters at the Eileen Theater.When they heard that they had to leave the familiar place because they had spent so many years, they were embarrassed.\u201cDo we have to move out of the theater?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t look like that. I feel like I\u2019ve become a bad person.\u201d Maribel frowned at Amelie and Sophie, who were looking at each other with frightened faces.\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re fully aware of her situation now that Julietta told you why she got the role of Princess Kiellini, and why she designed the dress.\u201dThe two nodded at Maribel\u2019s words.\u201cOf course, even if the dressing shop that designed Princess Kiellini\u2019s debut dress gets noticed, no one will pay attention to the tailors who work there. But I think you should be careful. I\u2019m afraid I should cut off the least bit of anxiety in the first place. Wouldn\u2019t it be strange for people to see you staying in the dorm if you\u2019re not an employee?\u201dMaribel put down her pipe and looked at the middle-aged women in front of her.\u201cIt\u2019s been almost twenty years since I took over the theater and met you. After Stella was kicked out by Marquise Anais and suddenly returned to the theater, I left Julietta, who was five years old, to you. I know you care a lot about her. You\u2019re the two people she trusts the most.\u201dMaribel took a long breath of her pipe after she said that. \u201cNot long ago, I got a call from Lillian.\u201d\u201cLillian?\u201dWhen Lillian, who was returning to her hometown after retiring, said she was going to be the mistress of Marquis Rhodius, they tried to deter her, as both of them reminded her of Stella. But after much thought, Lillian finally entered the mansion that the Marquis had provided for her.Fortunately, she seemed to be living without much worry or change, but they didn\u2019t think she would contact Maribel. They looked at Maribel, wondering what Lillian had been saying all of a sudden.\u201cI heard Prince Killian is looking for Julietta.\u201dLillian did not tell Maribel what Killian meant. But the Prince never seemed to give up, and she felt like he would send someone to the Eileen Theater, so she thought she should tell Maribel that the Prince was still searching for Julietta.\u201cWhy the hell is the Prince\u2026?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know why. Anyway, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good for two people who know about Julietta\u2019s past to be traveling between the theater and the dress shop.\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Amelia recalled what had happened and nodded. It wasn\u2019t as cold as Julietta thought it was, but it was true that they were told to leave anyway.\u201cYes, I\u2019m afraid staying in the theater is too much.\u201dAt Amelie\u2019s reply, Sophie also looked inside. \u201cThat\u2019s very nice. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m going to live in a place like this. It\u2019s so sudden, everything changed, so I\u2019m so befuddled.\u201dJulietta laughed as she admired the bright lemon-colored sofa in the drawing room.\u201cTake your time and look around. Even though it\u2019s a mansion that\u2019s not been empty for long, I want to change the interior again. I rushed ahead and don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll like it.\u201dAt Julietta\u2019s words, Amelie shook her head.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. You know it\u2019s crazy nice compared to our living quarters in the theater. By the way, when do you start working?\u201dAt Amelie\u2019s words, Julietta brought out a small note from the pocket of the maid\u2019s suit she was wearing in disguise.\u201cThe building for the dressing shop will be finished by tomorrow. Then, the fabrics and the workbench will come in. You can prepare the ones that are drawn on the note first. Make a corset for me first. This is the corset design.\u201dJulietta explained the clothes drawn inside the note to the two: a corset, a hat, and shoes.\u201cWe have about three weeks until the debut party, so we need to hurry up. The most urgent thing is the debut dress, and there are many things to prepare, including party and meeting dresses, casual clothes, coats, and props. You can hire people for shoes, gloves, coats, stoles for winter, or hats. But I really want you to make a dress for me. My figure is very different from that of Princess Kiellini, so no one else should know.\u201dSophie accepted the note at Julietta\u2019s request. \u201cYes, I know what you mean. We\u2019ll make everything where they could find out your figure ourselves. By the way, there are quite a few. I\u2019m worried if it\u2019s possible in such a short time.\u201dSophie was not an expert but said that after looking over the sketches.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be tough. I\u2019d like you to focus on party dresses and meeting dresses first. I\u2019ll come back in a few days to tell you the details. I can\u2019t leave for too long, so I have to go.\u201dWhen Julietta got up in a hurry, Amelie and Sophie got up, too.\u201cAnyway, when can you get rid of that ugly wig?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Debut, Part VTranslator: KhanEditor: AelryinthJulietta grinned as Amelie clicked her tongue at the sight of the brick-red wig that had been put on for her disguise.\u201cIt\u2019s ugly, but it\u2019s a bigger problem because it\u2019s more comfortable now.\u201dAt the end of the remark, the three women went out. After passing through the small garden in front of the annex, they entered the main house and walked across the hall on the first floor. Upon arriving at the front gate, Julietta looked back at the two and hugged the big Amelie and the small, compact Sophie once.\u201cI\u2019m so happy to be able to see you more often than before. It must be hard for you to come out of the place you\u2019ve been working, but I\u2019m sorry to both of you because I think I am only giving you more trouble.\u201dThe two hugged Julietta back.\u201cWe\u2019re really good, too. We didn\u2019t really like the new person in charge of clothes.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, everything hasn\u2019t been the same since Mrs. Megan retired. I was very tired because if there was any difference in the designs she drew, she was so nagging and tight.\u201dJulietta hugged the two who seemed to be trying to relieve their burdens, and then opened the door and went out to the street. She hurried to get to Gibson who would be waiting for her at the public carriage store on Eloz Street, instead of the mansion\u2019s wagon depot, which was still under repair.\u2014\u2014\u201cStop the wagon.\u201dKillian was on his way back to the Imperial Castle after touring the streets of Eloz to open a jewelry store. If he could find one, it was appropriate to open a store just as Julietta had once said.Killian briefly recalled her flashing eyes explaining her dream shop and ordered them to stop the carriage in a hurry as he saw a woman who casually walked past. Ian, who had been promoted from the servant of Sir Albert to the Prince\u2019s private servant, quickly ordered them to stop and opened the window on the side of the driver at Killian\u2019s order.When the carriage stopped in a hurry, Killian hurried down to the road. The aristocrats looked at Killian, who was walking hurriedly in search of the brick-red hair, ignoring his escort knights and Ian\u2019s surprise.\u201cYour Highness, who are you looking for? I\u2019ll help search.\u201d Ian dissuaded Killian, but Killian didn\u2019t even pretend to be listening. He stopped angrily when he could not see a familiar figure with her stiff broom-like brick-red hair and big glasses, even looking a long way.\u201cI\u2019ve missed her. She is gone in the blink of an eye.\u201dIan groaned, conscious of their surroundings and getting upset. \u201cYour Highness, let\u2019s get back on the wagon. We have drawn the attention of people.\u201dKillian swept up his glossy black hair which was down his forehead, glancing at the crowd who was converging on him, wondering what was going on. He wanted to catch and shout at those who dared to make a spectacle of him, but he had to refrain from making false accusations because he had decided to become an Emperor. Suppressing his feelings, he got back on the wagon that had followed him.\u201cIt was definitely Julietta.\u201dIan was surprised at the remark.\u2018How did the woman, who they could not even see any hair of when they searched through Bertino, return to Dublin while avoiding the eyes of the Prince?\u2019Killian nodded as if he had noticed Ian\u2019s thoughts. \u201cWhat a strange thing it is. Isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cYes, Your Highness.\u201dAs Ian looked at the fierce silver eyes, he swallowed without realizing it.\u2018Who in the world stole the woman from the Prince\u2019s eyes? What did he do this for?\u2019Ian even wanted to pray for the repose of his soul if he found out who it was. The fool would not die well if he were caught.\u201cIs the Eileen theater around here?\u201d Killian murmured in a low voice. While Ian hesitated to answer, Killian spoke again, \u201cLet\u2019s go to the Eileen Theater.\u201dAfter meeting with Lillian, he placed people around the Eileen Theater, but there was no specific news. But this sighting was near the theater where Julietta had grown up. It occurred to him that she had some sort of connection with the theater.\u201cWhile I am here, it\u2019s okay to watch a performance. Call Oswald and the Marquis of Rhodius. I\u2019ll see them at the Eileen Theater.\u201dCalling those two, instead of Count Adam and Count Valerian, who hated opera as much as they loved it, Killian flashed his eyes like a wolf. Finding Julietta was important, but now he was really beginning to wonder who was up to it, or what it was about\u2026\u2014\u2014\u201cWho\u2019s here?\u201d Maribel was surprised at what the theater manager had said.\u201cPrince Killian has arrived. He just said he would wait, even though I said we still have an hour left before the evening performance.\u201d\u201cDid he make reservations?\u201d\u201cHe didn\u2019t say that. While he was out, it was too early to go back to the Imperial Castle. He is going to watch the opera, so he told me not to worry.\u201dMaribel was lost in thought as she looked at the message from Raphael, who had sent in detail about the Duke of Kiellini staying in Tilia.\u2018Who would believe that Prince Killian stopped by the theater because he had spare time as he passed?\u2019After sitting silently for a long time, Maribel locked the desk after putting the letter she was holding into it, and stood up.\u201cPrepare the best wine. And as usual, you will put no one around the box seat I will be in.\u201d\u2014After giving the manager his orders, Maribel left her underground living quarters and went up to the top floor reserved for the royal family.\u201cYour Highness, it\u2019s an honor for you to visit the Eileen Theater. When you came before, I was sorry that you left before I even said hello.\u201dKillian nodded in resignation when the owner appeared and greeted him, as expected. \u201cOh, it was because I found something interesting that day. I just went back because I lost interest in the performance.\u201dMaribel laughed at Killian\u2019s words. \u201cAre you going to find something interesting in our theater today?\u201d\u201cI was wondering if it might be so. What do you think? Is there anything here that would interest me?\u201dFacing Killian\u2019s cold silver eyes, Maribel\u2019s mind began to run busily.\u2018He found something interesting in the theater. What was there that this noble Prince might have been interested in?\u2019Maribel was busy running her mind and thought of something. She grinned as she looked across at the Prince at the thought of it.\u201cYou must have noticed what I found.\u201dMaribel could certainly swear that she had never been so surprised as now. She barely smiled, hiding her trembling hands between the folds of her dress.\u201cI just got a call from Lillian a while ago. Your Highness is looking for Julietta.\u201dLillian said the Prince did not seem to know Julietta\u2019s true appearance. Maribel continued, barely calming her heart that was fluttering about what was happening so abruptly. \u201cUnfortunately, Julietta did not return to the theater, Your Highness.\u201dMaribel\u2019s appearance was very calm, the result of long experience. Killian grinned as he looked at her appearance with a wide-eyed stare.\u201cI just saw Julietta around here.\u201dMaribel\u2019s heart sank again.\u201cIt\u2019s true that she didn\u2019t come to the theater. I haven\u2019t heard anything from the people who have been monitoring it.\u201dAt Killian\u2019s words, Maribel\u2019s heart sank further down. Fortunately, it was obvious that he did not recognize Julietta\u2019s appearance when she was disguised as Princess Kiellini. She needed time to think, but the Prince kept attacking, not giving her a break.\u201cI know Julietta grew up in the theater. Was anyone close to her?\u201dMaribel wanted to praise herself for getting Amelie and Sophie out of the theater as soon as she had finished talking to Julietta. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know in detail, because I don\u2019t pay attention to every single child who grows up in the theater.\u201dKillian asked, looking at Maribel with a slight frown on her forehead, as if to recall. \u201cWho takes care of children when they come into the theater?\u201dMaribel clutched her shaking hands again at the sharp question. \u201cWe accept children who are entrusted with us as an investment, but it\u2019s very expensive to hire people to take care of children who can\u2019t do their part.

Debut, Part VITranslator: KhanEditor: AelryinthKillian nodded. He fully understood, because he was not interested in the private lives of his servants and maids.\u201cI\u2019ll send someone to the staff. Do you mind?\u201dMaribel nodded when he said he would dig into Julietta\u2019s whereabouts in earnest. \u201cNo, Your Highness, I don\u2019t care. I hope he doesn\u2019t identify himself as a person you sent. If you\u2019re rumored to be sending someone to the theater and looking for someone, it won\u2019t help you or our theater at all. Why don\u2019t you just disguise him as a distant relative of Julietta, looking for her whereabouts?\u201dEven though he would ask the staff, there would not be much they could say. They could say that she was just a normal kid with brick-red hair who had lived in the theater since she came there, a child who quit the theater one day after working in the prop room. It would have been this much.Most of the children who grew up in the theater were either working as members of the theater or going off as aristocratic concubines. That was what everyone would think of Julietta, who had suddenly disappeared.Maribel still smiled calmly to the Prince, who watched her with sharp eyes. It would not be good for Madame Anais to know that Prince Killian was looking for Julietta\u2026At Maribel\u2019s calm appearance, Killian nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll do that. You may leave now. Something urgent has come up, so I won\u2019t be able to see the performance today.\u201d Killian didn\u2019t care a bit that Oswald, who had a message from Ian, was on his way.\u201cYes, Your Highness. Please don\u2019t forget to take another glorious step next time.\u201dAt Maribel\u2019s courteous farewell, Killian departed in his carriage for the Imperial Castle. When the colorful purple carriage was finally out of sight, Maribel staggered back to her living quarters.\u2014\u2014A few hours later, Oswald, who had gone to the theater and walked about in vain, entered the Asta Castle\u2019s office in a fit of rage. \u201cYour Highness, you\u2019re so mean!\u201dInvitations for Oswald, who had returned to Austern after a few months, were constantly flooding in. He was preparing to attend a party hosted by Count Derio, among the many invitations.It was a secret that only a few people knew that the Princess Haint, who had been talking about possible marriage to Prince Francis, was pregnant from her love affair with Count Derio. The Duke of Haint was quickly put in a quandary by his daughter\u2019s deviation.He was the one who had refused to intervene in the political wrangling, despite the talk of marriage to Prince Francis. His daughter\u2019s mistake was a great disrespect to Prince Francis, which made him feel as if he had been caught in a weak spot. Oswald was quick to try his hand, because he was sure he wouldn\u2019t refuse Prince Francis\u2019s request as firmly as he used to.According to voluntary information from Moira, who was the Duke\u2019s mistress, but still loved Killian, the Duke of Haint did not favor the marriage of the princess and Prince Francis. Criticizing Francis\u2019s brutal nature, he said, \u201cIf he becomes Emperor, the Empire will be destroyed,\u201d adding, \u201cIt is totally unacceptable.\u201dMoira also questioned the sudden pregnancy of the Princess Haint. She suspected that the Duke and the princess had used the poor Count to refuse the hand of Prince Francis.\u201cToday I was preparing to attend a party at the mansion of Count Dario. You know how busy I am, but you made me walk all the way to the Eileen Theater in vain. You\u2019re so cruel, Your Highness.\u201dOswald had been trying to coax Count Derio, who was not part of any faction, trying to pull the Duke of Haint toward Killian. At Killian\u2019s sudden call, however, he gave up attending the party but what was waiting for Oswald at the theater, where he was not dressed properly, was an empty box without a note.Killian frowned at Oswald, who was very angry. From the look on his face, he seemed to suffer for a while.\u201cYour Highness! Look at my figure. Do you know how urgently I ran to the place?\u201dKillian glanced down at the documents, but looked up again to see Oswald\u2019s appearance, but he couldn\u2019t figure out where he was odd. His silver eyes shook with embarrassment and fell again.\u201cYour Highness, don\u2019t avoid me. This Oswald\u2019s been wandering through the street of Eloz with this kind of appearance, but you\u2019re telling me I don\u2019t matter that much.\u201dKillian decided to be honest with him because he had no idea what was wrong with him, although he was even more likely to get angry.\u201cWell, Oswald. I\u2019m sorry to come back to the castle without waiting, but something important happened. But I don\u2019t know where you look wrong, and why you are so angry.\u201dOswald\u2019s face flushed at Killian\u2019s confession.\u201cYour Highness, I feel so sorry. Look at my hair now. I didn\u2019t curl properly, so it is messy.\u201dKillian looked again at Oswald\u2019s head. The shiny fine hair was flowing around his neck, looking good, so he had no idea why he was so angry. But thinking he might have to listen to complaints all evening if he said he didn\u2019t know again, Killian intentionally froze his face.\u201cThat\u2019s not what matters now, Oswald. Don\u2019t you wonder why I called you all of a sudden?\u201dOswald poked his mouth up, tapping at the tips of his drooping hair. \u201cWell, did you see Julietta?\u201dKnowing that it couldn\u2019t be true, he was ill-tempered and made invidious remarks, but Killian replied, \u201cOswald, you\u2019re different from Adam, too. You noticed right away.\u201dOswald was genuinely surprised when Killian raised his voice in an unusually upbeat tone, and asked back, \u201cDid you really see Julietta?\u201d\u201cYes, I saw her on the street of Eloz. She disappeared in the blink of an eye, but it was definitely Julietta.\u201dKillian\u2019s mouth crept up. Oswald looked at the smile, and shuddered. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you so happy in a long time.\u201dKillian\u2019s expression instantly hardened when Oswald gave up his drooping hair and sat down on an office couch.\u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense, and send someone to the Eileen Theater tomorrow. It\u2019s something the owner of the theater allowed, so as to get to know everything about Julietta. It\u2019s okay to find out very slowly. When they are busy, he will help out with theater work.\u201d\u201cOh, did the troupe leader allow it? I\u2019ll have to go there myself. I\u2019m thinking about taking over a theater, so it\u2019s okay to go and see what happens behind the colorful stage.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know how she\u2019s involved in Julietta\u2019s affairs, but I smell something. My visit today seemed quite embarrassing to her. Who the hell is up to this? Why?\u201dKillian concluded that there must be some conspiracy behind Julietta\u2019s disappearance. Whoever brought Julietta to the capital he was in was making a mistake. Now that he knew she was here, he would find her!Oswald quickly felt better about the Prince\u2019s increasingly interesting love affair, and made a noisy gesture to bring tea.\u2014\u2014\u2014-A few days later, Julietta again visited the dressing shop, disguised with a brick-red wig and glasses. Today Gibson was out with Simone, so she moved about in a business carriage by herself.Not even dreaming of Killian finding her, Julietta got out of the carriage and looked up at the ivory building three stories high. On the front porch of the restored building was a sign with a dress, shoes, and a hat, along with the words \u201cChartreu\u2019s Dressing Shop.\u201d Under the bright pink sign on the ivory building, a glass-lined porch was visible.Julietta stood in front of the wide-open door showing a transparent glass window, holding her throbbing heart. After months of hard work as a substitute, she would finally be able to continue her future in this dressing shop.She opened the glass door and entered, going across the hall, which was still empty, and to the door on her right. Inside the large room, which used to be a family drawing room, were Amelie and Sophie, who were busy making clothes starting early in the morning.\u201cJulietta, come on.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you feel uncomfortable working here?\u201dJulietta said so and looked around the studio.A large workbench for the foundation was placed in the middle, and various fabrics were piled up in one corner in a renovated main drawing room of the mansion. A small table and chair were placed on the back terrace heading toward the annex, serving as a place to rest when they were exhausted from working. From the terrace, she could see the annex and the garden on either side of the road.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Debut, Part VIITranslator: KhanEditor: AelryinthJulietta had a proud face as she looked at the kitchen set on the wall toward the terrace. The glass cabinet was furnished with a tea set and various kinds of tea leaves, and right next to it was a magic furnace for heating the tea and a small sink for washing the teacup.\u201cIt\u2019s an incomparably good environment compared to the theater prop room!\u201d Amelie replied, taking up the work she had laid off in the presence of Julietta.\u201cIs that the corset I asked you to make?\u201d\u201cYes. This is a corset pressing to the chest, and you will feel pressured, and I wonder if you will be able to breathe,\u201d Amelie said, putting the animal bones for the corset between the delicate silks.As the fabric came in soon, the white undergarment was almost complete. Before making a formal dress, Julietta, who needed a special corset to press her chest flatter, approached Amelie to see if it was made as she had asked.When Amelie finished the corset she had made at Julietta\u2019s request, she stuck it out with another corset she had completed yesterday.\u201cPut it on. I finished it quickly. To take your measurements, you\u2019ll have to wear a corset.\u201dSophie followed her to help as Julietta took a white and black corset and walked into the back of the cubicle in the corner.\u201cBut I\u2019m glad I don\u2019t have to tighten it up, as my waist is so slim. If I tighten up to my waist, I might end up suffocating!\u201dThrough a mirror placed in the inner space of the partition, Julietta saw herself. Unlike its white, innocent-looking color, the corset, which pressed the chest and hugged the waist tightly, looked rather indecent.Thanks to the ruthless corset, her bust seemed to have shrunk by an inch or two, but her cleavage, which was under heavy pressure, was soaring up to form a deep valley. Looking back and forth awkwardly, Julietta tried on the dress she had taken off.\u201cHow do you feel? Does your chest look smaller?\u201dStill, the chest area seemed to be a little more relaxed. Sophie nodded too, looking over Julietta\u2019s front and back.\u201cIt certainly looks smaller. You just press your chest in, but it\u2019s amazing how the overall atmosphere looks different.\u201dSophie\u2019s words brought in Amelie, who was outside.Even in decent, neat clothes, she always looked glitzy and mature without realizing it, but relatively pure and gentle, just because the breast area was flattened. Julietta looked around, satisfied with her reflection in the mirror, and took off her clothes again.\u201cI think you can measure it this way.\u201dWhile measuring the details for the dress as required by Julietta, Sophie was upset and tearful.\u201cI thought you\u2019d finally take off that boring wig and find yourself, but now you have to put pressure on your chest. When will you be free to live in your original form?\u201dJulietta smiled as she looked back at the upset Sophie. \u201cThere\u2019s not much left. I\u2019m really free now after this.\u201d\u201cHowever, you have to live as a faceless designer even after this job is over. You have to cover up everything when you go out.\u201dAt Amelie\u2019s words, Julietta paused for a moment. Even if she escaped from her status as a princess, she should still not be exposed to the world.A sigh crept out. She thought this was a life where she shouldn\u2019t show her face for her lifetime. All she had to do was hide her face. She shrugged as she put the fabric she had picked out for the dress down on the workbench.\u201cI\u2019ll have to hide my true self, but I won\u2019t have to read others\u2019 countenances.\u201d Julieta recalled the time when she had been in jail and shivered without knowing why. \u201cI\u2019m going to make a lot of money. I\u2019d rather not be swayed by anyone else in my life.\u201dIf her status in the social class system was insignificant, she thought she should have enough money for others to grovel before her. If she had something in her favor, it was being different from other people\u2019s memories and experiences.Julietta now looked around the interior of the splendid building that would serve as the foundation for her new life.\u2018It starts here. This is the first dressing shop for Madame Chartreu.\u2019When she thought about the name Chartreu, which she had actually picked in a hurry without thinking about anything, seeming pretty cool, she laughed.\u201cNow that you\u2019ve taken my measurements, shall we go and pick the fabric? Is there any other fabric in the warehouse other than the ones here?\u201dJulietta took off her chest-pressing corset and left the studio with a gallant spirit.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\u201cDo you want me to make it as it is?\u201dJulietta picked out the fabric for the dress and left the dressing shop for the blacksmith\u2019s.After the war, a blacksmith\u2019s shop in a peaceful continent turned into a place not for making swords, shields, and war weapons, but a place for making real-life tools, such as interior decoration props and glasses.\u201cYes. Please make a model of a woman\u2019s figure, a mannequin.\u201dTo make a mannequin with neck to hips, Julietta showed him a detailed drawing she had prepared.\u201cWhere the hell are you going to use this ugly thing?\u201dThere were many people with strange hobbies, but no one openly demanded a cut-off body figure, like the drawing the girl had shown.The blacksmith looked carefully up and down at the maid who had stiff brick-red hair and ugly glasses. He thought it might be a hobby of the maid, even though he thought it might be an errand for a pervert, because it didn\u2019t seem like a thing to handle.Julietta smiled at the suspicious smith. \u201cMy master will use it for decoration in her dressing shop. She is going to put a dress on top of this and put it on display in the hall.\u201dUpon hearing Julietta\u2019s explanation, the blacksmith looked down at the painting once again. He just thought it was some kind of hideous thing, but it seemed plausible to him if she would dress it up.\u201cIs it dressing up top?\u201d The blacksmith nodded as if he had understood then.\u201cYes. Make a cross frame so it can stand, and make the support long enough to the floor. Can you make it not too heavy by being tall?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not hard, but it\u2019s a little problem to make this upper body shape. But it\u2019s not impossible at all, so I\u2019ll try.\u201dJulietta gave another picture to the ruminating owner. \u201cIs it possible to make a small, thin square plate the size of a hand?\u201dShe opened her palm and said, \u201cI\u2019d like to make it very thin, with the store name and address on it.\u201dIt was an inquiry about making a VIP card for the shop\u2019s regular customers. Since discrimination based on class and birth status was strictly enforced, she was going to create a membership card according to the appropriate grade. In addition, a special metal business card was to be made and sent with the invitation.Julietta tried as hard as she could to explain modern business cards as she could. Considering the various conditions, she had opened a store outside the main street, so she wanted to put a metal business card with an address on the invitation in order to make it easier to tell where the dressing shop was located.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be this thin. It\u2019s going to be hard, but\u2026 do you mean I should print characters on top of this?\u201d\u201cYes. I\u2019d like to make it by type of metal. I\u2019d like to have black letters engraved on a silver plate, if possible?\u201d Julietta asked the master gently, counting the money in her hand inwardly. \u201cIs it expensive?\u201d\u201cIt depends on how many. It\u2019s not hard to make a plate, but it\u2019s not easy to engrave them.\u201dJulietta was very pleased with the blacksmith\u2019s words. Unlike modern times, he did not have laser imprinting technology, so he had to carve it by hand. Feeling burdened by costs after being buoyant with expectations, Julietta asked him to make only twenty copies.Julietta wanted to make a lot of business cards and give them to customers immediately, but changed her mind after the cost of the production. She decided that she would only put cards together with an invitation to those specifically chosen, to create scarcity.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

There will be an address under it, and we\u2019ll put the address of the person who will receive this membership card on the back. Please leave it empty for now. I\u2019ll make a list tomorrow and come back.\u201dJulietta left the blacksmith\u2019s shop and caught a passing carriage. Not knowing that Killian\u2019s minions were looking for brick-and-mortar hair in the very center next door, she walked toward the carriage to return to her mansion, with the inward thought of finding an investor to grow the dressing shop.\u2014\u2014A few days later, a light green wagon bearing the emblem of the family of Kiellini appeared on the street of Eloz. People who were passing the street to shop or go to the promised place turned their eyes on the Kiellini wagon.Each country\u2019s Emperors and high-ranking aristocrats had their own colors, set for each family. High-ranking aristocrats who were given their own colors used them to show off their specialty when they decorated wagons, letters, the cloaks of their knights, stables, and flags. Only the head of the family and the direct line using the family name could ride the wagon in the family\u2019s colors.Now that the Duke of Kiellini had gone down to Tilia, the light-colored carriage on the street of Eloz meant that the princess of rumors, the immediate line of the family of Kiellini, was riding it. It was only natural that all the aristocrats who enjoyed shopping, dining, or entertainment on Eloz Street were attracted to the sunny green wagon.The wagon passed through the main street at a slow pace, and stopped in front of a three-story building in the outer area. Those who were very greatly interested in quickly went after the carriage, and they saw slender Lady Iris, a big hat and veil covering her face, getting off the wagon.People stared at the building Princess Kiellini was clearly in. Soon, rumors began to spread rapidly in the town of Dublin.\u201cOh, my God! I can\u2019t recognize you.\u201dWith dark green dresses and sets of hats off, Julietta was not the dull, brick-red haired girl that Amelie and Sophie had seen so many times.The bright blonde hair was loosely tied up with ribbons of the same color as the wrapping dress, and the thin cloth dress that matched the hot weather in July was beautifully wrapped around her slim figure. Sophie breathed a happy sigh at Julietta\u2019s unexpected appearance after always wearing a baggy dress.\u201cYou\u2019ve finally recovered your figure. How sad it was to keep such a pretty child hidden in such a hideous figure.\u201dAmelie also looked at Julietta with satisfaction and spoke up, \u201cIt looks good compared to the way it used to be, but why is the color of a girl\u2019s dress who is just blooming so gloomy?\u201dAll the dresses she had bought and worn in a hurry at Bertino were dark in order not to attract attention. The dress she wore today was a neat neck-length design without lace or other decorations, with only one ribbon of the same color as the dress around her neck.Julietta smiled at grumbling Amelie. \u201cIt\u2019s because I prepared my clothes in a hurry.\u201d\u201cBy the way, is it okay for Princess Kiellini to go alone like this, without a single maid?\u201dJulietta replied to Sophie\u2019s concern, \u201cI haven\u2019t been able to find a private maid yet. Vera, a maid of Marquise Raban, takes care of me, but she\u2019s been out a lot these days to follow the Marquise. That\u2019s why I came here alone.\u201d\u201cYou have to get a private maid quickly, even if it is inconvenient.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m careful because she has to be someone I can trust,\u201d Julietta answered and walked into the studio.\u201cBut Julietta, what the hell is this ugly thing that came to me yesterday?\u201dA body with only the upper part, a mannequin with no arms and legs that the blacksmith had sent to be checked first stood in the corner of the workroom.\u201cOh! It is here. Did you get only one?\u201d Julietta inquired, scrutinizing the scarlet copper body.\u201cHe said he sent it to make sure it was done right. If there\u2019s nothing wrong, he\u2019ll continue.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s perfect. Tell the blacksmith to make the rest of them as this one is. When you get the rest, you can put them on here and display them in the hall as soon as the dresses are done.\u201d\u201cAre you going to put them here?\u201d\u201cYes. They will preview of the dresses in our dressing shop. We\u2019ll also have bags, shoes, hats, and so on.\u201d Julietta experimented with a less complete dress hanging on one side of the studio.\u201cHow about it? Is it plausible?\u201d\u201cHow did you end up thinking about this? It must be very different from just illustrations.\u201d\u201cYou won\u2019t be able to make all kinds in advance, so you should have them in a picture book, but they\u2019ll feel different about it if they see some kinds of dresses on display. They can try it on in advance.\u201dIn this era where there was no ready-to-wear, nobles had to go to the dressing shops and get measured. Then, depending on the mood of the person who would wear the clothes, the designer made the clothes for them.Designers\u2019 abilities were proven according to how responsive they were, and famous designers were so popular that people couldn\u2019t even wait for their turns during the social season twice a year. As a result, the higher nobility was able to order their clothes in the more famous shops, and the success of the dressing shops varied depending on which aristocrat\u2019s lady and wives ordered their clothes that season.The famous dressing shops were so busy, their power matched that of most aristocrats. As a result, most of the noblemen of the lower class who were lucky enough to overcome fierce competition and order their clothes from popular designers were forced to wear them, even if they did not like them.Julietta remembered the stories of the actresses in the theater complaining each time. They could order their clothes from the dressing shops that were famous in Dublin using the power of their lovers, but they used to express their irritation since the dresses were not matched for them. Still, it was very impressive of her to be proud of herself after her irritation, saying that no one could ignore her in these clothes.Julietta wanted to get rid of the phenomenon where they couldn\u2019t even complain about their clothes, because it was more important to be able to order clothes from a certain dressing shop than it was to like them. She wanted to give consumers the right and freedom to choose and wear clothes that they liked. It was sad to have to wear something so expensive that they couldn\u2019t say they didn\u2019t like it.Julietta planned to show and choose more diverse designs and decorations to consumers, mostly picture books with similar designs, shoes, and hats. It was scary how much it would cost to do all this, but it was something she really wanted to do.Julietta explained to Amelie and Sophie about her plan, and then went into the cubicle to try on a dress made over the last few days.***\u201cThe clothes have arrived from the dressing shop.\u201dThe day of Julietta\u2019s debut party finally dawned. From morning on, clothing prepared by Amelie and Sophie day and night arrived at the Kiellini estate. The maids came up with the clothes and various props and put them down in the room.Meanwhile, Simone had been busy seeing her old friends again after leaving Julietta the job of the dressing shop. The move was aimed at quelling public suspicions about her niece having gone down to Tilia Territory for health reasons. So, it wasn\u2019t until today that she saw Julietta\u2019s debut dress.She frowned at unfamiliar designs. \u201cIt\u2019s different from the clothes that are in fashion these days. Isn\u2019t that too prominent?\u201dIt was now fashionable among ladies and young wives to wear gowns with deeply lined, sleeveless dresses decorated with ribbons and lace. Also, they used to decorate their sleeves with thick wrinkles despite men and women, but these dresses themselves were completely different in form from those dresses.Julietta replied, looking down at a flower-like dress spread out on the bed. \u201cIf I kicked out the best designer in Austern and went out dressed in a similar outfit that doesn\u2019t have anything to do with them, they would think it\u2019s weird,\u201d Julietta said to Simone, who was still frowning.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Debut, Part IXTranslator: KhanEditor: Aelryinth\u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s going to be alright, and you have to get ready, too. Fashion is a revolution. If I were a humble lady, I might be beaten by clothes today, but the status of a lady named Kiellini will block everything. No matter what I wear, people will admire me.\u201dJulietta went so far and approached Simone and lowered her voice. \u201cIt\u2019s his only precious daughter\u2019s debut day, but he\u2019s still staying there, and it\u2019s also good to turn their attention from the Duke to the dress.\u201dAt Julietta\u2019s words, Simone looked down at the re-opened dress. It was different from a fashionable dress, but it was true that it was a beautiful dress.The Duke, her brother, might not have hoped for a raucous debut, but as Julietta said, the Duke did not appear at his only precious successor\u2019s debut party, and that was gossip in itself. Rather, it would be okay for society to be noisy because of a raucously unconventional dress for days and days, turning its attention away from the absence of the Duke.At this point, she was not going to go too far in questioning the true intentions of the Duke. Simone\u2019s expression sank coldly, determined to make a hole for her escape if it didn\u2019t work out, since her brother treated her like a scarecrow.Simone nodded at Julietta. \u201cYes. As you say, the family of Kiellini will be your shield. What are we afraid of? Do your best for my brother to hear how beautiful you were, who was unable to be with his daughter on her debut day due to his illness.\u201dSimone left the room, determined that the Duke was ill, having been told he had gone down to the Land due to an incident.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\u201cOh, my God! My lady, you are so beautiful.\u201dJulietta, who had yet to get a private maid, was able to complete grooming with the help of the maids of the mansion of the family of the Duke. Wearing the dress that had finally arrived after a long bath and flavored massage, she stood in front of the mirror and looked at herself.She lowered her curly cute hair to both sides and piled her back high like a tower. Unlike today\u2019s fashionable hairstyles, the colorful blonde with pink wavy hair tied together and stretched out behind her back. The top of a tube with dark blue glossy satin and a pale embroidered flower-shaped embroidery, a chest-shaped top that began without a string exposed a slender neck and dazzling shoulders. The lower part was made of a soft mesh fabric, which overlapped with layers of sky-blue saffron, allowing it to swell to the fullest extent without having to wear a panier.Because she didn\u2019t wear a heavy panier that limited women\u2019s movements, Julietta\u2019s behavior seemed as light and cheerful as everyone else. On top of the chiffon skirt, the dress, which had avoided monotony by adding a few large flowers made of the same fabric, was very different from the dresses that were in fashion.With a simple diamond necklace and bracelet inspired by laurels and no other decorations, Julietta\u2019s figure had not been enough to bring any praise from the world, but now everyone just opened their mouths and uttered exclamations.Julietta nodded as she looked at herself in the mirror. She thought Manny\u2019s blessing had been quite annoying before this, but it was very satisfying to have such a relaxed setting.\u201cCan I be the main character of today\u2019s party with this much?\u201dThey praised her for being pretty, but she still felt uneasy. She bravely made her own dress and wore it as she thought it was pretty, so she thought she shouldn\u2019t worry too much, but she was still nervous.\u201cOf course, my lady. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be the lady of today\u2019s party.\u201dWhen she was ready, Simone entered Julietta\u2019s room and said affectionately, \u201cThat\u2019s so pretty. You don\u2019t have to be the main character of today\u2019s party. All you have to do is show the health of Princess Kiellini and let them know that there is no big problem with your succession to the title.\u201dShe scrutinized the dressed-up Julietta, then nodded and gestured to the maids to step aside.\u201cI was worried the first time I saw the dress, but it\u2019s okay to wear it. But what did you do with your chest?\u201dJulietta, who had been struggling to deal with her chest rising due to the pressure, had covered the upper part of her chest with a simple ribbon made of the same fabric of the upper part, on top of the tube. Thanks to it, her chest was only slightly protruding to match her slender figure.\u201cI made a corset that came up to my chest.\u201d As Julietta pretended to press on her chest and explained, Simone\u2019s eyes rose.\u201cYou\u2019re acting carelessly again. Now you\u2019re going to be looking at every move you make, what the hell are you trying to do?\u201dSimone\u2019s attitude had changed a lot in the meantime, just shown by her expression changing from the initial \u201creckless behavior\u201d to \u201ccareless behavior.\u201d Julietta smiled at the thought.\u201cI\u2019ll be careful. I\u2019ll be nervous when I go to the party and probably do better. Whew.\u201dJulietta said so and chose to take a breath for a moment. Wearing a corset put pressure on the chest, it was hard to breathe naturally. When she saw that, Simone sighed.\u201cI don\u2019t know if you can dance properly. But it doesn\u2019t matter if you don\u2019t dance as much as you can at your debut party.\u201dMost of the first dances with a lady who would debut in the winter or summer social seasons were done with close friends of family members and future-promoting partners. As Julietta was playing the role of Lady Kiellini, it would be difficult if the rumors got wild, so dancing with someone was not very wise.Simone was furious with the Duke, who once again had not come up from Tilia Territory. Julietta had no other family and no one to dance for the first time at the party today. Simone shook her head thinking of Marquis Anais, Regina\u2019s uncle. It was unclear whether he would attend the party or not, and he had not shown any interest in Regina, who had been born to his sister.No matter that she was a substitute, it was only natural that she would want to wear pretty clothes and dance the dance she had learned for the party she would attend. Simone quickly turned around, feeling heartbroken at the sight of Julietta whose eyes were bright enough to light up the room.\u201cLet\u2019s go now that we\u2019re ready.\u201d\u2014\u2014-The continent\u2019s social seasons were the winter season held in November, December, and January, and the summer season held in June, July and August. On Friday of the first week of every season\u2019s last month, they held an official debut party in the Imperial Castle for the ladies and gentlemen that had made their debuts in society. Except for the royal family\u2019s birthday and anniversary, it was the only party where all nobles could attend freely.After February, when the winter season ended, all the aristocratic children became adults to mark their seventeenth birthday. The long-looking imperial party was splendid and majestic, showing the dignity of Austern, the center of culture and art. Some people from other kingdoms or the Vicern Empire attended to enjoy the sight.Christine also attended to meet Killian, as it was a rare royal party. As it was a party held in the Imperial Castle, the order of admission had been arranged in order of titles, so she was waiting in the assigned lounge for the order to enter. Thanks to the position of the first Queen, the ranking of the family of Marquis Anais was the second among the ten families of the Marquis families, following the imperial family, the Marquis of Rhodius.There was a long time left before she could enter, in accordance with the custom of entering from the lower ranks, but her father Robert himself seemed unwilling to be with her mother, Ivana. As soon as he arrived at the lounge, he left early on the pretext of feeling heavy, leaving only Ivana and Christine alone in the private restroom representing the family of the Marquis.\u201cYou still haven\u2019t given up on Prince Killian?\u201d Christine\u2019s eyebrows were distorted at the cold words of her mother. \u201cAs the marriage prospects with the Princess Haint were broken, you are the best match for Francis. So, stop dreaming in vain.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Debut, Part XTranslator: KhanEditor: AelryinthChristine wanted to say, \u201cSo, did you press a man with the power of your family and now you are neglected for your lifetime?\u201d but she was forced to bear it and looked into the mirror hanging on the wall behind Ivana. Christine stared blankly at the sky-blue dress and sapphire necklace that matched her eyes before opening her mouth toward Ivana, who was waiting for her answer.\u201cDon\u2019t you think that the princess Kiellini is making her debut today, and for the Prince\u2019s partner, she\u2019s going to be more helpful?\u201dIvanna clicked her tongue at her daughter\u2019s words.\u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019s the best woman if she doesn\u2019t have as much health as you say. If Francis joins the family of Kiellini, the Emperor, who loves Killian, will have no choice. If the three families of Duke Dudley, Duke Miguel, and Duke Kiellini add their power to Francis\u2019s fight for the throne, the story is over. If Francis succeeds to the throne, Killian will be dead. But what are you dreaming about?\u201d\u201cHis Highness promised that if Prince Killian gives up the crown and serves him as the Duke of Bertino, he will spare him.\u201dIvana sighed at the words of her foolish daughter. It was because she remembered the young days when she had cried out, \u201cIf not him, I will die,\u201d falling in love with the beauty of the Marquis.\u201cIt\u2019s your life, so what can I say? But I\u2019ll just believe you won\u2019t do anything that hurts our family,\u201dIvana said coldly and cut off her interest in her daughter.\u2014\u2014Killian was waiting for Spencer on a curtained terrace with Oswald, who had already finished his entry.After a while, Marquis Rhodius and Spencer, who were both unwilling to attend the party, ignored the order of entry and came up to the terrace through the side door. Spencer was stunned by the sight of Oswald sitting on a sofa on the terrace, in even more colorful clothes than usual.\u201cOh, Oswald! You\u2019re more colorful today.\u201dSpencer smiled vainly as he looked back at Killian leaning on the corner of the terrace with an expression of disapproval, keeping away from Oswald.\u201cIt\u2019s the semi-annual debut party in the Imperial Castle. This Oswald can\u2019t stand his heart beating every time.\u201d\u201cWhy is it that your heart is pounding after ten years of attending the debut?\u201dWhen Killian snorted as if he were not funny, Oswald protested with a look of disapproval,\u201cYour Highness, it\u2019s only been eight years. Eighty years from now, the debut party will always be exciting. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing something new this year.\u201dIgnoring Oswald who spoke so loudly, Killian looked casually into the noisy inside through the slightly open curtain.\u201cMarquis Robert Fyodor Anais, Marquise Ivana Mary Glane Anais, and Lady Christine Priscilla Anais are entering.\u201dChristine was seen entering, together with the Marquis and Marquise of Anais, who were rumored to be in a bad relationship.\u201cWhat\u2019s the racket? The husband and wife of the Marquis attended the party together.\u201dKillian answered at Spencer\u2019s words, \u201cToday is the day when Princess Kiellini makes her debut. I\u2019m sure they have to attend as a relative.\u201dSpencer glinted at Killian, who was looking inside again at the mere mention of them.\u201cDo you really have Princess Kiellini in mind as the Queen?\u201d\u201cI just came out to see what kind of woman she is,\u201d Killian said bluntly, as if to stop talking nonsense.\u201cI\u2019m sure Prince Francis won\u2019t stand a chance, because he has the best bride he has ever thought of, because she is weak. For Your Highness, the Lady of Kiellin may be a better alternative than Lady Anais, who has something to do with Dudley, so there\u2019s only one thing left to be noisy about.\u201dOswald rose from his seat and stepped in. Spencer tapped his chin at the sight of Killian, who looked displeased, but didn\u2019t say anything.\u201cDo you think your position could be shaken depending on where the princess\u2019s mind is headed?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure Prince Francis thinks so, but it\u2019s not going to be a big problem. It may just be a little annoying. Three of the five Dukes will be on the side of Prince Francis.\u201d\u201cWhat happened to Duke Kiellini, who has confined himself in Tilia Territory? He doesn\u2019t even attend his beloved daughter\u2019s debut party.\u201dWhen Spencer asked, Killian answered, \u201cIf I think about it, that\u2019s weird. He went down to Tilia Territory as if he had waited for the princess to come up to Dublin. The Duke keeps getting on my nerves, so I\u2019m thinking of visiting Tilia Territory soon.\u201dHaving no idea what the Prince was talking about on the terrace, Christine enjoyed the eyes of people and leisurely looked around the hall where the party was held. It was the third time she had attended a royal party since her debut in January this year. It was a great pleasure to enter the banquet hall, enjoying the curious and interested eyes of the people, though not too often.\u2018If I marry Prince Killian, I\u2019m going to have to get out of Austern\u2019s social circle and lock myself in Bertino,\u2019 Christine mumbled to herself as she drew up her future. But it didn\u2019t matter. Social circles weren\u2019t as making the person hers who she had been looking at for more than a decade. Until then, she would enjoy this social life that everyone looked forward to, and she pretended to greet them, with an arrogant nod back to the ladies who were greeting her.Francis was confident that he would become an Emperor if he kept the prophecy of the fortune teller, but she did not believe it.\u2018If the old woman\u2019s prophecy is so spiritual and correct, the next Emperor should be the Prince of the line of descent, but there is no such Prince.\u2019\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-As a child, Christine had gone to the Imperial Castle and heard what the Empress and the fortune-teller were saying in the garden.\u201cThe Emperor of Austern will be inherited by the Prince of the line of descent. So, don\u2019t worry too much, Your Highness.\u201dAt the fortune teller\u2019s words, the Empress smiled with great joy.Christine told the story to her aunt, the Queen. The Empress was assassinated shortly after on her way to Bertino. She knew that the assassination of the Empress was carried out by her maternal grandfather, Duke Dudley. When Duke Dudley heard the prophecy of the day, he killed the Empress, to raise his daughter, the Queen, to the Empress.But gambling at the risk of Duke Dudley\u2019s life was of no use. The Emperor said he would never bring in a new Empress. In any case, since the Emperor had no Prince of the line of descent, the fortune teller\u2019s prophecy was wrong. Therefore, she could not believe the prophecy of the next Emperor.Christine thought Killian would be afflicted by Francis. She was willing to do anything to make him Emperor, even if it turned out to be a betrayal of Francis and the first Queen, her aunt.For Duke Dudley, her maternal grandfather, she was going to persuade him that pushing herself to be Empress would be a wise option if Francis, his only grandson, was not likely to become Emperor. When Killian became Emperor, she would also be able to stand in the last place to enter, with eyes envying her at his side.It was time for Christine to retrace her plans in her head.\u201cMarquise Simone Anastasia Jennifer Raban and Lady Iris Regina Josephine Kiellini are entering.\u201dAt the moment, the noisy hall became quiet and everyone\u2019s eyes, including Christine\u2019s, turned for the door of the hall, which was just opening.\u201cJulietta?\u201dThe Marquis, with a slight blush on his face, looked at Princess Kiellini with astonishment as she entered the banquet hall.The green eyes glowed with the same blonde hair as his own. She looked so much like Julietta smiling at him when she was young. However, she looked similar to his younger sister, Katarina, if he thought otherwise.Robert, the Marquis of Anais, tried to recall the image of the niece whom he had met with his sister a long time ago, but the memory was too dim. He had consciously avoided the child born to his sister after learning of Julietta\u2019s death. There had been no more meetings with his niece, who had gone down to the Territory when his sister had died of illness a few months later.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Debut, Part XITranslator: KhanEditor: AelryinthIvana, in the meanwhile, looked at Princess Kiellini with a grimace. Had the owner of the Eileen Theater not shown her the body of the illegitimate child a month ago, she would have doubted her; she was very unhappy that this girl looked so much like her husband Robert.It was no surprise that the unfortunate Katarina looked like her husband, as they were nearly twins, so her daughter was similar to her husband. However, it was unpleasant that the child who was her niece looked more like her husband rather than her own daughter Christine.Ivana clicked her tongue unintentionally, comparing Christine with a blonde girl. If it hadn\u2019t been for her noble status as Princess Kiellini, she would have believed that her husband had another daughter from somewhere.So, as Robert and Ivana looked at Julietta in their own way, one could not react for a while, shocked by the looks of Princess Kiellini and the dress she was wearing.It was so different from what they had imagined. Rumors of her poor appearance had spread as if it were a fait accompli, as she had no interaction with people because she was confined to Tilia Territory, and she had been reserved in Dublin.Everyone laughed at her in pity that she had to make her debut despite her hideous appearance in order to succeed as the Duke. However, the princess who had appeared so confidently looked exactly the opposite of the rumor.Robert soon came to his senses as people looked alternately at Marquis Anais and Princess Kiellini, who looked so alike. That child couldn\u2019t be Julietta, so it was time to do the duty of attending the party. He took his family and approached his niece, who was in the eyes of everyone.\u201cMrs. Laban, it\u2019s nice to meet you. I\u2019m so glad to see you like this again. Iris, it\u2019s been a long time since we last met. Congratulations on your debut!\u201dJulietta entered the banquet hall trembling but was inwardly embarrassed when no one approached. As soon as she was worried if the way her dress was too prominent, she turned to a voice which sounded happy, and hardened her face.\u201cYour Excellency, Marquis Anais, and Mrs. Anais. It\u2019s been a while.\u201d Simone pretended to remember the Marquis and Christine and greeted them. Looking vacantly at the Marquis of Anais, Julietta quickly came to her senses and bowed politely at Simone\u2019s voice.\u201cThank you for congratulating me like this. How have you been?\u201d\u2018I\u2019m your daughter. How have you been eating well and having a good life?\u2019 she wanted to say, but barely endured. The Marquis replied quickly to Julietta\u2019s greeting\u2026\u201cAre you okay now, after they said you were sick? I should have visited you earlier, but I had no time.\u201dRobert looked closely at his niece, and she reminded him more and more of Julietta. He was overwhelmed by the thought that if she had grown up safely, she might have looked like this now. He projected Julietta on her figure, facing the green eyes that resembled him.Christine looked up at her father with astonishment, as Robert looked at her like the world\u2019s most precious thing. He had a kind appearance which had never been seen by herself or her younger brother. But Robert only focused on his niece in front of him, without paying any attention to Christine.\u201cThanks for your concern, I\u2019m better now.\u201d Julietta turned her eyes away from Marquis Anais, who was no different from her dim recollection. Strangely, she felt her heartbeat strongly and tears about to come out. She was thinking about how to avoid the place, and all of a sudden, the music began to play, marking the beginning of the ball.\u201cI\u2019m afraid no one from the royal family will be present today.\u201dIt was a party held inside the imperial palace, but it was often held without owners, so Ivana apologized to Christine.The very beginning of the party meant she could not meet Prince Killian, but Christine couldn\u2019t afford to pay attention to the part because she was looking at her father and her cousin, Princess Kiellini.\u201cWill you give me the honor of the first dance of your debut?\u201d The Marquis reached out to Julietta as he watched the fast-filling dance hall.\u201cFather!\u201d Christine called the Marquis in astonishment, but Robert only looked down at Julietta with friendly eyes.\u201cThank you, Your Excellency, the Marquis. My brother went down to the Land because of his illness, so I was wondering who to ask for Iris\u2019s dance partner today. Iris, come on.\u201dSimone pushed Julietta\u2019s back, knowing that Marquis Anais was the biological father of Julietta, who was set to refuse him. All eyes were on the party floor as Julietta reluctantly held hands with her \u2018uncle\u2019, the Marquis, and headed for the dance hall.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Killian, watching this from the terrace, ordered Oswald, \u201cThe Marquis of Oswald, when the dance is over, by whatever means, bring the princess into my lounge.\u201d\u201cYou fell in love with her at first sight, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Spencer asked Killian in surprise.\u201cDon\u2019t be so insinuative. You\u2019d know better that could not be true.\u201d\u201cI thought it might be.\u201d\u201cThe princess Kiellini is beautiful today, but he\u2019s not in love with her at first sight. He saw her in Baden Land. But, Your Highness, what are you going to do when you meet her?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think it would be a bad idea to see what kind of person she is before Francis reaches out.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re trying to figure out if she\u2019s worthy of being the Queen.\u201d\u201cMarriage is a kind of business. I don\u2019t like that love or affection interferes in it.\u201dSpencer nodded as if he understood.\u201cI\u2019ll be going to the restroom now, so Oswald, hurry up and get the princess in front of me. Spencer, don\u2019t follow me. You\u2019re officially coming through the door.\u201dOswald sighed slightly as he watched Killian disappear into the garden, using the terrace railings as a door, as he had done when he had come, after Killian dissuaded Spencer from following him.\u201cNo matter who I am, how can I take such a young girl who is in the spotlight to His Highness? If I go to Princess Kiellini and say a word, there will be a rumor all over the city that she and I promised the future tomorrow.\u201dSpencer jumped over the terrace rails like Killian, patting the shoulders of Oswald, who was lost in worry.\u201cI don\u2019t want to go through that hunting ground, so I\u2019m going to the restroom. I\u2019ll see you alive after completing your mission.\u201dOswald remained alone as Spencer disappeared in the direction that Killian had gone without looking back, tore his hair and suddenly raised his head.\u201cYes, there\u2019s a way I should use\u2026 the way the ladies use.\u201dOswald opened the terrace door excitedly and entered the party.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\u201cYou really look like your mother.\u201d Robert smiled affectionately, looking down at his niece who was slightly lowering her head, as if she was nervous.Julietta, who had been counting to herself for fear of missing the beat, almost burst into laughter at the latter\u2019s words. He might say she looked like his younger sister, Katarina, but she wanted to laugh out loud if he knew she looked like her mother, Stella.\u201cYes, my father said that I look like my mother.\u201d\u2018Because that\u2019s what you said, I am not lying, right?\u2019Julietta inwardly burst out laughing, as if he had said something very funny. Robert laughed, as she seemed to feel better when he said she looked like her mother, not knowing her thoughts.When people looked at them with smiles, Ivana looked back at Christine.\u201cLet\u2019s go back if you\u2019re going to be in such a mood. Do you know how hateful your face is now? Of all occasion, she wore the same sky blue.\u201dTo Ivana, Christine was a painful figureChristine was the one she gave birth to after she fell in love with the Marquis of Anais and pestered her father, Duke Dudley, and almost threatened him after he first refused her. He married her, and had slept with her the first night of the marriage. For a moment, she had known the joy of conceiving a child, but her husband, as if he had finished his duty, lived in the lover\u2019s house that he had been in and out of before his marriage. Ivana hated the child she carried, thinking she had lost him to his lover because of her hideous appearance while bearing a child.\u201cI wish you had blonde hair and green eyes like Fjord.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Debut, Part XIITranslator: KhanEditor: AelryinthIvana looked irritably at her faint, sky-blue eyes, which had no liveliness at all with her dark hair. If she resembled the Marquis like her second child, Fjord, her hatred might have turned into love.Ivana, with a nervous face, recalled the miserable old days.For the five years after Christine was born and she had Fjord, she was in her husband\u2019s arms only when a threatening letter from the Duke was delivered to the Anais mansion hastening a successor. Ivana was still good. It was because she was happy to be held in his arms.So, when the heir to the family of Anais was born, she believed that the Marquis would return to her. Therefore, while Robert was in Vicern, she kicked out his lover and the blonde girl that she had given birth to from the mansion in Harrods Street.It was a miscalculation. The Marquis who had returned from Vicern became furious and treated her like a stone strewn down the street. Her husband betrayed her belief that he would be faithful to his family once he had a successor.How pleasant it was to announce their death to him, who only sought his lost lover and daughter, and who refused to love her.Ivana was contemptuous of her daughter, who was trying to follow in her footsteps. In the first place, there was no love, so she wasn\u2019t interested, but it was not pleasant to see her own foolish old self in her daughter.\u201cAre you going to stay and make a fool of yourself? Then I won\u2019t stop you. Next time, you\u2019d better figure out the color of the dress of the princess in advance and avoid wearing the same color.\u201dChristine looked only at Princess Kiellini dancing with her father, the Marquis, without caring about Ivana, who was leaving.He was reluctant when he danced with her on her debut stage. He did not look at her affectionately like now, but rather tired, as if he were a little exhausted. That alone made Christine hate her cousin, the princess, so much that Ivana\u2019s words pierced her heart.A bright, crisp blue dress and colorful blond hues weighed down on her and her dark hair in a light-blue dress. Thinking of that, Christine turned around, and grit her teeth in anger. No matter how she felt, she had to show social kindness to the princess who had grown up in thecountryside all her life, as planned. If Princess Kiellini married Francis, Killian would no longer be able to resist her.Christine had to put in much effort to force a smile as she walked toward the crowd of young people gathered there.When Julietta and the Marquis left the dance hall after dancing, Christine came to them with the same kind of ladies as if she had waited for.\u201cFather, I\u2019d like to introduce ladies to the princess. Will it be okay?\u201dThe Marquis of Anais nodded with a regretful look, pressing down on his desire to be with his niece a little more. He felt that he should not interfere with the social life of a child who had grown up in rural areas without being able to interact with her peers all her life.\u201cYes, Christine. You take good care of her. She\u2019s a weak kid, so be careful not to overdo it.\u201dChristine forced a laugh, holding back that she wanted to scream at the scene of the worried Marquis.\u201cYes, Father. Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll take care of her, my cousin. Princess, this is the lady of Count Patrick, this is the lady of Viscount Vieri, this is\u2026\u201dThe introduction of the ladies that Christine brought along continued. Julietta thought she should stay alert, as Christine\u2019s image was like a gangster coming out to extort money. Her smiling mouth trembled as if she were been trying to be kind.\u201cIt\u2019s very kind of you to come here to say hello. It\u2019s nice to meet you.\u201dJulietta nodded graciously and smiled pretentiously, as she had learned while being beaten red. Ladies were confused when she looked so different from the princess who was known for such big blotches on her face that she had stayed in a rural area. They greeted the princess and began to examine her to find fault.Lady Patrick who was the first to be introduced asked, \u201cYou have a very unusual dress. Everybody was wondering when you didn\u2019t order your clothes from Madame Louai, but whose dress is it?\u201dAll their eyes glistened, waiting for Julietta\u2019s answer, as they wondered who made such a dress among whom they knew\u201cShe is a new designer. She is very good at her work.\u201dIt was time for everyone to ask questions again, because they were all burning at the look of the princess avoiding a pointless conversation.\u201cAll the most beautiful flowers in the world are blooming here. This Oswald is on the way to investigate the garden because it\u2019s so lonely.\u201dOswald naturally stepped in and twirled and bowed gracefully. Julietta quickly covered her face with a fan, as she would burst into laughter even several months later.\u201cOh, Marquis Oswald. You\u2019re here today. Didn\u2019t you forget you promised to dance with me before?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s my turn this time. I don\u2019t know how uninteresting the winter season was when Marquis Oswald was in Bertino.\u201dIn an instant, the attention of the party members shifted from Julietta to Oswald. It would have been a strange thing to not get the spotlight, as he appeared so colorfully.\u201cCome on, ladies. This Oswald has one body. I\u2019ve been overworked in Bertino and I\u2019m not feeling very well right now. But I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to get better without seeing the beautiful young ladies.\u201d\u201cMr. Oswald, where are you sick? Isn\u2019t Prince Killian coming today?\u201dAs soon as Oswald appeared, Julietta, who was enjoying watching Christine change her face and ask questions like a gentle sheep, was surprised at the mention of Killian.The fact that Marquis Oswald was here meant that Prince Killian was back in Dublin. Julietta, who had not thought of seeing the Prince again while attending the party secretly stepped back behind the crowd. It was hard to recognize the fact, but she began to feel uncomfortable with Oswald.Oswald was looking for a chance to try out what he had planned, making an agreeable response to the words of the ladies. Then, as Princess Kiellini stepped back as if she were going to leave, he became very urgent. He gracefully called over his servant, picked up a drink and ordered him to distribute some to the ladies, too. Then he turned and said to Princess Kiellini, holding out the glass, \u201cPrincess Kiellini, I\u2019m sorry for the delay in greeting you. My name is Phillip Leslie Oswald.\u201dJulietta gave up trying to slip away at the greeting of the Marquis of Oswald. Turning reluctantly, she tried to greet him, taking the cup that was sticking out toward her. But the moment she reached for the glass, suddenly the Marquis of Oswald staggered.\u201cAh!\u201dA fragile groan came out of his mouth as the cup he was holding shook dangerously. Oswald wrapped his head with his glassless hand and began to lean toward her. Oswald\u2019s servant came in a hurry as Julietta staggered, holding him in her arms.\u201cHe must have been exhausted. Oh, my God, he said he wasn\u2019t feeling well!\u201dLady Patrick hovered around Oswald, who collapsed in a bust.\u201cOh! The Marquis must have caught the dress of the princess as he collapsed. He won\u2019t let go.\u201dLady Vieri made a fuss, pointing to Oswald\u2019s hand.\u201cOh, my God. I guess he thought he caught a lifeline when he fell down.\u201dSomeone in the back gave a sad sigh as if it was regrettable.Julietta glared with a stunned look at Oswald\u2019s hand, who was clasping the flowers on her chiffon dress. When she saw him skillfully throw over the glass he was holding as he fell down, she knew that Oswald\u2019s fainting was fake.She was so nervous that he might have recognized her, but she regained her composure because she thought it was not possible. For now, she had to find out why he was trying to get out of the party with her.\u201cI\u2019ll have to go with him first. Hurry up and move the Marquis to the lounge.\u201dAs his servant carried the fallen Marquis on his back, Julietta also stood up and walked out of the banquet hall. Julietta walked quickly, looking back at the string of worried people following. When some distance was secured, she whispered quietly to Marquis Oswald, \u201cWhat\u2019s your purpose?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
