They sat one in front of the other again for this exam, only, this time, their positions were reversed.The two sat down according to their examination numbers. Their gazes met and held for a long while, then they smiled.Shen Jie said, \u201cBro, you get it.\u201dWan Da said, \u201cI do get it. To a good partnership.\u201dAfter comparing their answers, the two started chatting up a storm via their cheat notes. They didn\u2019t finish their chat during the language exam, so they continued during the English exam.When we\u2019re done here, wanna go get lunch?Where should we go?The cafeteria. Where else?The cafeteria menu today is a little scary\u2026 invite Zhao-ge and the others along?No choice, even if it\u2019s bad. Of course! Invite everyone. We weather the storms together.Jie-ge, speaking of which, how long have you known Zhao-ge?They had had a nice chat about lunch, but now Wan Da began to change the subject. Shen Jie opened the note, saw these words, and knew that Wan Da\u2019s busybody heart was like the weeds that wouldn\u2019t die even after being swept by wildfire. When the spring wind blew, it would sprout, again.Shen Jie thought about it. He\u2019d known He Zhao for close to three years.When they met, dance games had been popular, and the streets were full of non-mainstream fashion. Shen Jie was quite the good kid at home, but out of doors, he went very wild and often went to internet cafes. He even had an online relationship with a girl who talked with emojis.These illegal internet cafes were mostly hidden away in little nooks behind winding paths. After finding the sign, one needed to bend down, slip in, and push open a small door to find the world of underage non-mainstream youth.For three bucks,\u00b9 they could enjoy an hour of time online.Enjoyment was enjoyment, but this particular internet cafe was quite risky, and got reported at the slightest provocation.If the kids were unlucky and were caught by the police, their families would be notified to pick them up\u2014an even graver offense than failing an exam.Shen Jie remembered their encounter to this day. After he paid, he collected his number tag and wandered the entire hall looking for machine 6. Amidst the non-mainstream crowd whose bangs covered their eyes, he discovered someone with his head pillowed on his arms in front of a computer, sleeping.A black and red sports jacket and very short hair. Near his ear, he\u2019d very audaciously shaved the letter \u2018n\u2019 into his hair. Several cigarette stubs lay in the ashtray next to his hand.Just from the view of his back, Shen Jie felt that this person\u2019s languid attitude was a little overbearing, and found him irritating on sight.Computer number 5.Computer number 6 was right next to the cool handsome guy.Shen Jie carefully sat down. He pressed the on switch and discovered the person was lying on his mousepad. He tried to pull it out quietly, but ended up accidentally waking the guy.The guy wore headphones that had already been on the verge of falling off. As he looked up, they slid down and hung around his neck.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Damn, what a pretty face\u2026Shen Jie was so shocked he jumped.The cute guy didn\u2019t speak. After waking up, he continued typing.On the screen was the latest and hottest dance game. Even Shen Jie had grit his teeth, bought QQ currency, and downloaded it.To the students, a set of clothes radiating suaveness was the core of dignity while playing the game. In the game, everyone acknowledged each other as brothers and sisters, but this newcomer wearing an impossibly ugly amateur\u2019s uniform might as well have picked the name, \u2018Don\u2019t add me as a friend.\u2019It was a game requiring hand speed, but the guy still found time to open a can of cola one-handed and drink it.Shen Jie had heard of a big bro on the street who picked this sort of underage internet cafe to collect protection fees from, but he\u2019d never encountered him in person.Until a guy wielding a stick kicked down the door and swaggered in.In the height of summer, the guy wore a floral Hawaiian shirt. His beer gut was so big that he couldn\u2019t fasten the buttons over it, so the shirt was half undone. He looked intimidating and his face was greasy.Floral Shirt walked in, a cigarette in his mouth. He banged on the computer table with his stick. \u201cThings have been a little tight lately. You know what I mean\u2026 quickly.\u201dA little money would settle matters. Most people would think like that, but when it was Shen Jie\u2019s turn and he was about to hand it over, somebody held down his hand.He Zhao stood up. He\u2019d finished his cola, and squeezed the can in his hand; he exerted only a little force and formed a deep indent in the can. \u201cCollect what? What are you doing?\u201dThe reminiscence stopped here. Shen Jie wrote on the paper: Zhao-ge is my idol.In the last exam room.For a long time, Xie Yu wasn\u2019t sure how to answer. He wrote the words, You\u2019re an idiot, on the paper, then scribbled them away.During the second half of the English exam, several students in the last row made a ruckus, just short of tossing the answers at the invigilator\u2019s head. Tang Sen shifted his chair to the back of the room to observe the exam, right beside He Zhao.Xie Yu folded up the note. In the end, he didn\u2019t find a good chance to hand it over.He Zhao didn\u2019t wait. He lay down on the table and was sound asleep before long.The bell rang, the papers were collected, and the environment became lively again.He Zhao was sleeping soundly. While the papers were being collected, Xie Yu called him several times. He didn\u2019t react and even turned his head to bury his face in the crook of his arm.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dXie Yu turned in the exam booklet for him. Before he handed it over, he glanced over the answer sheet from start to finish, and found that He Zhao would probably score about 35 points.While the papers were being collected, the people beside him took the chance to compare several more answers. \u201cThis question, C? What about this one? Is it B?\u201dXie Yu calmly changed several of his answers to the wrong ones.The monthly exams covered just three subjects: language, math, and English.In the afternoon, after the math exam was over, Class 2.3 had two periods of self-study while the teachers graded the exams.Liu Cunhao and the others intended to sneak out to the basketball courts to play ball. He Zhao didn\u2019t really want to stay in the classroom doing nothing, either. He got up and said, \u201cI\u2019m going too. Let\u2019s go.\u201dLuo Wenqiang said, \u201cYou only ever watch us play\u2026 your ankle still isn\u2019t well?\u201dHe Zhao said, \u201cI\u2019m too good. I worry I\u2019ll wreck your confidence.\u201dLiu Cunhao said, \u201cMy ass.\u201dHe Zhao continued, \u201cReally. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll scar you.\u201dThey chatted for a while and decided they did want to go to the basketball courts.He Zhao had just walked out when he turned back. \u201cOld Xie, coming?\u201dXie Yu didn\u2019t even look up. \u201cSo, go.\u201d\u201cYou said it.\u201d He Zhao went straight over and tugged at his hand.Xie Yu found it ridiculous. He\u2019d rejected it so clearly\u2014what did he mean, you said it?He Zhao pulled apart the words \u2018So, go\u2019 and repeated them. \u201cSure, I\u2019ll go.\u201d\u00b2Xie Yu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dDean Jiang stopped them on the way to the basketball court. This man, who was pushing forty, opened the window to his office and stuck out his head. \u201cYou on the basketball court, what are you doing? It\u2019s class time. What are you doing? Class 2.3, right? Get your asses up here.\u201dDean Jiang\u2019s loud voice carried very well.Wan Da, carrying the ball, hopped from foot to foot. \u201cDamn it, so unlucky? Doesn\u2019t Mad Dog have to grade exams? Isn\u2019t he a math teacher?\u201dThe few of them formed a row in front of the faculty office.Dean Jiang asked, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you explain yourselves?\u201dLuo Wenqang, as the gym rep, could not in good conscience remain silent now. He stepped forward and said, \u201cWe were practicing basketball. Our class formed a basketball team\u2026\u201d\u201cWait.\u201d Dean Jiang got even more angry after hearing the reason. \u201cThere\u2019s no tournament going on. If there\u2019s no tournament, what on earth are you all practicing for?!\u201dLuo Wenqiang couldn\u2019t say anything more.But He Zhao calmly replied, \u201cStrength training?\u201dAs a result, all of Class 2.3 watched the few of them, who had said they were going to the basketball court to play ball, run laps around the quad under the hot sun.Xu Qingqing\u2019s desk was by the window. She stared for a long time and didn\u2019t understand what was going on. \u201c\u2026What are they doing?\u201dThe others also indicated that they didn\u2019t know. They guessed, \u201cWarming up?\u201dDean Jiang didn\u2019t leave. He stood in a shady spot and counted laps for them. \u201cDon\u2019t you love exercising and strength training? Run! Fifteen more laps\u2026 if you can\u2019t finish them, don\u2019t go back to class.\u201dIt was extremely hot out, and only when they were running did they catch a slight breeze. Sweat flowed slowly from their foreheads.\u201cFifteen laps. If you\u2019re a man, you run fifteen laps,\u201d He Zhao said as he ran. \u201cOld Xie, can you do it?\u201dXie Yu ignored him.He Zhao got more into it the more he ran and even ran ahead of Xie Yu. Then he turned and started running backwards. He looked at Xie Yu and said, \u201cWanna make a bet? Who finishes fifteen laps first.\u201d\u201cDo you have nothing better to do?\u201d\u201cDo you dare?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dDean Jiang only said fifteen laps, but didn\u2019t really put them on the spot. After watching them run three laps, he left, which was tacit acknowledgement that they could go back to class.The quad had been exposed to the hot sun all day and the smell of asphalt was strong.Dean Jiang had just left when Liu Cunhao and Wan Da helped each other over to the side. \u201cLet\u2019s go, let\u2019s go. This is killing me.\u201dAside from the gym rep who was happily running, only He Zhao and Xie Yu were still doing laps.\u201cThose two must be crazy\u2026\u201d Wan Da stood beside the flag podium and watched them chase each other around, a little stunned. \u201cFifteen laps, really?\u201dLiu Cunhao was incredibly thirsty and assumed they didn\u2019t know that Mad Dog had left. He yelled to them twice, but they didn\u2019t respond, so he left it alone, too. \u201cThey probably really want to do strength training. Let\u2019s go get water.\u201dRunning, lap after lap, is quite addictive.Drenched in sweat, footsteps unending. Letting your mind go blank. You can think of nothing at all. If you want to vent, then run on viciously with all your strength.Even if it\u2019s tiring, so exhausting your breath comes quickly, so exhausting you taste blood in your throat.By the end, Xie Yu\u2019s back was thoroughly soaked, the hem of his shirt catching in the wind.There was only one thought left in his mind: sprint. Keep running. His body burned with it.\u2026\u2026Thirteen.Fourteen.Fifteen rounds.The two crossed the finish line at the same time.He Zhao dashed forward a little further, then stopped.He stood on the spot for a long time, then picked up the hem of his shirt and mopped at his face. The line of his waist and his abdominal muscles were briefly exposed. Sweat rolled down his neck, and he raised one hand after he had wiped his face like he wanted to high-five Xie Yu, his voice unbearably hoarse. \u201cBadass. You\u2019re quite something.\u201dXie Yu bent at the waist. Aside from his labored breathing, his ears were buzzing and he couldn\u2019t hear He Zhao\u2019s voice clearly.He Zhao was exhausted, too. He lay flat down on the quad and looked up at the wide and edgeless sky.For some reason\u2014perhaps because his mind had fallen into a completely blank state just now\u2014after he had calmed down, something mysterious flashed before his eyes.\u201c\u2026He Zhao, just focus on revising. The high school entrance exams are coming up and I have a set of mock exams here. When you\u2019re done, I\u2019ll go over it with you. With your grades, which high school in A City can\u2019t you get into?\u201dHe Zhao scratched his head; he didn\u2019t want to keep thinking about it. He couldn\u2019t hold back a curse. \u201cFuck.\u201dXie Yu rested for a while. He sat to the side, both hands supporting his weight against the courtyard floor, and kicked He Zhao. \u201cHey.\u201dHe Zhao answered after a pause, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dXie Yu said, \u201cIf I called you idiot, would you answer?\u201dHe Zhao wasn\u2019t sure why Xie Yu was suddenly bringing this up. \u201c\u2026You\u2019re the idiot.\u201d\u201cSo.\u201d Xie Yu followed him and lay down on the ground. After the vigorous exercise, both of their voices were a little hoarse. They were very close together, and as Xie Yu breathed he thought he smelled the detergent on He Zhao\u2019s clothes, mixed with the scent of sweat. \u201cDon\u2019t ask other people. Ask yourself.\u201d[]Translation notes: [1]about 42 US$ cents [2]The words for \u2018So, go\u2019 when said with a gap in between can be interpreted as \u2018Sure, I\u2019ll go\u2019Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",

We can\u2019t be lazy! Wake up, all of you. Welcome a new day and new challenges.\u201d\u201cStudents, I believe you are all ready!\u201dBefore Mad Dog even finished, the corridor was already growing noisy. \u201cReady, like hell!\u201d\u201cThis is abuse of the flowers of our homeland!\u201d\u201cBrothers, don\u2019t stop me. I\u2019m climbing up there to cut the cord. I\u2019m taking down this crap broadcast today. Between it and me, only one can live! I can\u2019t go on like this.\u201dXie Yu closed his eyes and rested for a while. He moved to reach for the alarm clock at the head of the bed, even though he usually just ended up throwing it.When he moved his hand he noticed that he ached all over.Xie Yu half-opened his eyes and the first thing he saw was He Zhao\u2019s profile. Two people in a single bed was a tight squeeze and they had to lie on their sides to make room.He Zhao had not woken, but his sleep had been disturbed and the arm around Xie Yu\u2019s waist tightened reflexively.Xie Yu\u2019s gaze moved downward from his face and landed on the faint red marks on He Zhao\u2019s throat. Only now did the memories of last night return, little by little.\u2026\u2026He had scratched those marks himself.Xie Yu buried his head in his pillow and closed his eyes again. Images of the previous night played in his mind like a movie.He had no strong feelings on the subject of who was on top. He was cold by nature and if not for He Zhao\u2014if not for him\u2014Xie Yu might not even have had these sorts of thoughts.And he had drunk a lot last night. Even though his head had been clear, he had not been in control. He Zhao had held him down and done it to him.When Mad Dog started on his second topic, He Zhao finally woke up. He scratched his head and whispered, \u201cMorning. What time is it?\u201dXie Yu wanted to say, \u2018Shut up and look for yourself,\u2019 but his throat was dry and he couldn\u2019t say anything.He steadied himself and, in the end, said nothing at all. He threw aside the covers and got out of bed. When his bare feet landed on the ground he let out a hiss and breathed in sharply.He Zhao knew that he had been rather rough last night. But Xie Yu had been stubborn and kept challenging him. \u201cCan you or can you not?\u201dWhen He Zhao finally went at it, he couldn\u2019t take it. His body had gone taut and he was both reluctant and unwilling when he finally asked for mercy.At this point, He Zhao half sat up and asked, \u201cDoes it still hurt?\u201dXie Yu was a little annoyed.He bent down and picked up the clothes on the floor, one garment at a time. His head ached from a hangover and discomfort enveloped his whole body. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201dHe Zhao said, \u201cNext time I\u2019ll\u2026\u201d\u201cThere is no next time.\u201dXie Yu pulled the door open and said, \u201cYou\u2019re too bad at it.\u201dNeither of them had experience. He Zhao had been crude and untried, and he hadn\u2019t controlled himself. He had no skill to speak of.But the emotional thrill outweighed the biological one.This person is mine.Without reservation.Every part of him.Xie Yu had planned to pack up and go to class early, but he had overestimated his physical ability.He slept till noon. By the time he woke up, it was lunch break.He Zhao pushed the door open, lunch in hand. Xie Yu was still curled up in the blankets.\u201cGet up and eat something before going back to sleep.\u201d He Zhao put the takeout box on the desk, then walked to the bed. He reached out and ruffled Xie Yu\u2019s hair, which was sticking out. \u201cBe good.\u201dIn response, he received a pillow Xie Yu had thrown.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dXie Yu sat up after tossing the pillow. The blankets slid to his waist. His shirt was a little messy, the collar askew.He Zhao looked once and didn\u2019t dare look more.Xie Yu got out of bed, bent down, and took out two changes of clothes from the closet.He Zhao leaned against the door of the en suite bathroom, listening to the sound of running water inside. He said, out of the blue, \u201cA few people were late this morning. Old Tang pulled them into the corridor and questioned them, but the lot of them found one excuse after another\u2026\u201dSeveral people were late that morning. All the live-in students who had drunk and talked about life on the rooftop last night nearly couldn\u2019t get out of bed, and six or seven of them stood in a straight line in the classroom doorway.Although Old Tang was good-tempered, this was the first time he had seen a whole string of students arrive late. \u201cWhat happened to you? What were you all doing last night?\u201dDing Lianghua hemmed and hawed for a long time, then said, \u201c\u2026Sorry, sir, I overslept.\u201dOld Tang questioned them from the head of the line to the end, one by one.They all had to find excuses and they couldn\u2019t repeat themselves. The further Old Tang got, the more he challenged their imagination.In the end, someone even said his pants had ripped halfway while walking here. They really even came up with such excuses.\u201cSir, when I got to the math building, I suddenly heard the sound of fabric tearing down there\u2026 in that moment, I felt that time had stopped. The world around me turned from color to black-and-white.\u201dHe Zhao acted it out quite well.Xie Yu pushed the showerhead lever and complained, \u201cIs his brain broken?\u201dThe sound of running water gradually stopped.\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d He Zhao asked again. \u201c\u2026Don\u2019t go to afternoon classes, either. Sleep a little more. I\u2019ll go tell Old Tang for you.\u201dAlthough Xie Yu still didn\u2019t feel too well, he wasn\u2019t so bad off as to need He Zhao\u2019s concern.Xie Yu put on his clothes, pulled open the door, and said, \u201cI\u2019m not crippled.\u201d\u201cWas I really that bad?\u201d He Zhao stepped aside to let him pass, but he was still fixated on the topic from this morning. \u201cBut you sounded so satisfied.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dXie Yu really wanted to say, That was from goddamned pain.After they had eaten, lunch break was nearly over. When Xie Yu and He Zhao returned to the classroom, they collided with Wan Da who was just walking out.\u201cYu-ge, you\u2019re finally here? I really shouldn\u2019t have bought beer. I nearly didn\u2019t get up in the morning, but my roommate kicked me out of bed\u2026\u201dWan Da felt that something was not right. He looked again and caught a glimpse of Xie Yu\u2019s neck. Near his shirt collar, there was a red mark.Xie Yu was pale and, up close, Wan Da could see the pale blue veins lying beneath his skin.The red mark was very obvious.\u201cRight.\u201d Wan Da didn\u2019t remember until Xie Yu had already passed. Then he slapped his forehead. \u201cOld Tang came by just now and said you should go to his office to see him.\u201dThis term, Xie Yu had not skipped class much, and he had not fought or made trouble either. He was much less worrying than before.All the subject teachers often discussed the two \u2018students of the moment.\u2019\u201cHe Zhao did quite well in last term\u2019s end-of-term tests.\u201d A female teacher had finished grading homework and now reclined her chair, intending to take an afternoon nap, and murmured. \u201cOld Wu really can teach. 49 points. That\u2019s quite all right. I remember he used to score 10 or 20 points\u2026\u201dDuring the lunch break, there weren\u2019t many students in the faculty office and the teachers would chat, a couple sentences at a time.Old Tang had not joined in the discussion, busy tidying some things at hand. Only when Xie Yu knocked on the door and entered did he look up. \u201cYou\u2019re here? Have a seat.\u201dXie Yu had thought Old Tang was looking for him to talk about him skipping class that morning. He was about to say, \u2018I won\u2019t next time,\u2019 when he saw Old Tang push a thick stack of papers towards him.On the very top sheet of A4 paper was printed Exam Content Outline and Summary.It was all foundational material. It started with a summary of junior high content and the first line was, \u2018Ways to Write an Analysis Essay.\u2019 The critical points were printed in red.Xie Yu stared at it, stunned, and for a while he wasn\u2019t sure what to say.\u201cI took some spare time during vacation to put this together, though it\u2019s not very comprehensive. Take this back and look at it with He Zhao. Or make a copy, that\u2019ll do, too.\u201dOld Tang twisted open the cap of his water bottle and poured out some wolfberry tea. \u201cYour issue right now is that you usually don\u2019t memorize a lot. Read this a few more times and memorize it. That way, when you do practice questions, you\u2019ll know how to approach the questions\u2026\u201dHe said he \u2018took some spare time to put this together,\u2019 but looking at the stack, Xie Yu could tell he had spent a lot of time on it.Then Old Tang continued thoughtfully, \u201cWith how your grades are now, the college exams are still a little dangerous.\u201dXie Yu had no idea what he was talking about. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all right if you don\u2019t know the answer. But you still have to try doing the homework the teachers give you.\u201d Old Tang sighed, then continued, \u201cAnd don\u2019t keep reading comics in class.\u201dSince school had started up again, Xie Yu had not continued his act of being a bad student, but he still gave off an air of not being serious. Someone whose future prospects were dismal.Erzhong was not a tough school. The homework given after class was too easy, and neither he nor He Zhao did much of it. They only needed to look at it and they knew the answer, without even moving a pen. Instead of spending time on these questions, they could do a few more challenging ones instead.It was the same in class. When he heard something interesting, he would look up and listen for a while. The rest of the time, he was looking at the set of Olympiad questions he had bought on his own.The school term had only been in session for half a month and they had not yet had tests. For the first time, Xie Yu felt the burden of slackerdom. It really was heavy and he couldn\u2019t throw it off if he tried.Xie Yu opened his mouth. He nearly said, Sir, I\u2019m not. I didn\u2019t.\u201cRight, and there\u2019s this, too.\u201d Old Tang took two sips of tea, put his cup down, and pulled out another folder from a drawer.Inside the folder were his and He Zhao\u2019s exam papers.He and He Zhao never did corrections on their exam. But now, beside every question they got wrong, Old Tang had made markings in red pen. Not only the right answer, but the solution steps and a model answer were placed next to them on post-it notes.Xie Yu was completely speechless.He felt that the burden of slackerdom might crush him to death.Xie Yu had never met a teacher like Old Tang.Previously, on Black Water Street, his grades had been outstanding and the homeroom teacher had let him participate in academic competitions. Aside from that, he had not interacted much with the teacher. After coming to Erzhong, the subject teachers only wanted him to lay low and not cause trouble.Looking at the study guide, Xie Yu finally understood He Zhao\u2019s words, \u2018I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll scare them.\u2019 Class 3\u2019s homeroom teacher really did think of him and He Zhao as students who needed help.And the study rep, who also often worried about their studies and their grades.He Zhao had only raised his exam scores by a dozen points or so at the end of the term and Class 3 was even happier in the group chat than if they themselves had gotten good grades.\u2026\u2026The study guide in his hand grew heavier and heavier.Old Tang looked at the time and saw lunch was about over. He waved a hand and said, \u201cAll right, go back to class.\u201dWhen Xie Yu brought the stack of notes back to class, Class 3 was in chaos. The school was probably about to hold another sports meet. Luo Wenqiang held up a flier and shouted, \u201c\u2014Anyone else? Anyone else want to join?\u201dHe Zhao, sitting in the back, had joined in the shouting. He stopped when he saw Xie Yu coming.Xie Yu tossed the study guide onto the desk. He Zhao reached out and turned a couple pages. \u201cWhat did Old Tang need you for? What the hell is this?\u201d\u201cStudy guide.\u201d Xie Yu silently sighed, hesitated, then asked, \u201cThat plan of yours\u2026 where is it? Let me see.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dXie Yu said, \u201cThe gradual improvement plan.\u201dLuo Wenqiang was still at the podium asking if anyone wanted to join.Someone had just come back from outside and asked, \u201cWhat event is this?\u201dLuo Wenqiang said, \u201cBasketball tournament! Excited? Do you feel the burn of a man\u2019s hot blood?\u201d\u201cWasn\u2019t it cancelled?\u201d\u201cI heard from Wan Da that Mad Dog asked the higher-ups many times and finally got approved\u2026\u201dLast year\u2019s basketball tournament had nearly ended in a fight and Mad Dog had reprimanded the whole school for it. He had scolded them harshly and proclaimed that he was going to axe this event, then told them to all go kick shuttlecocks.\u00b9But it was also Mad Dog who had gone to the school board in private, asked for mercy, and gotten their basketball tournament back.The class bell rang, but they didn\u2019t want to stop talking about the basketball tournament. When Old Wu came in, he scolded them. \u201cYou\u2019re holding a meeting? Did you hear the bell?\u201dDuring the first class of the afternoon, Old Wu introduced a few new content points, then made them do practice questions in class to cement the knowledge.The only noise remaining in the classroom was the soft sounds of writing implements making contact with desks and several students quietly discussing the question.Xie Yu held his pen. On the desk was the book of Olympiad questions all the teachers had mistaken for a comic book.He felt some despair.He Zhao was slumped on the desk, but he was not asleep. He reached out and pulled Xie Yu\u2019s pen from his grip, little by little. \u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201dXie Yu suddenly found his hand empty. He closed the book of Olympiad questions and thought, What could I be thinking? The burden of slackerdom is too heavy, that\u2019s all.\u201cI\u2019m thinking of leaving everyone else a way out.\u201d[]Translation notes: [1] Kicking shuttlecocks: ThisPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He thought that the question was simple and they should all have understood, but when he looked up, he saw the two worst students in the year intimately putting their heads together. \u201cThe two of you in the back, I know you\u2019re close, but could you give me your attention while you\u2019re in class? \u2026Am I that un-charming?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re charming, you\u2019re charming.\u201d He Zhao was very obliging and raised his voice. \u201cOld Tang is Erzhong\u2019s Aaron Kwok and you\u2019re Erzhong\u2019s Andy Lau.\u201dXie Yu was very impressed by He Zhao\u2019s ability to kiss ass without batting an eye.Old Wu was on cloud nine from the praise. Amidst raucous laughter, the middle-aged man\u2014about 18,000 li away from Aaron Kwok\u2014 lifted a hand and ran it through his hair, then calmly continued to say, \u201cYears ago, I cut quite a popular figure in school too.\u201dThe class laughed till they couldn\u2019t sit straight.After the racket, some of the students who had been dozing off were now much more alert. Old Wu stopped while he was ahead and told everyone to quiet down. \u201cDid you get the answer for the question I told you to do just now?\u201dHe had spent the class period going over a few new concepts and the in-class exercise wasn\u2019t a hard one. Xie Yu was listening with his head propped on his hand, but suddenly He Zhao reached out and tugged his collar up. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u201d He Zhao paused, then said uncomfortably, \u201cThere\u2019s a mark.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe Zhao said, \u201cI\u2019ll be more careful next time.\u201dXie Yu was about to say, \u2018Get lost,\u2019 but he noticed the tips of his ears were warm before the words left his mouth.Old Wu finished going through the questions just in time for the bell.Everyone was already staring at the timetable on the left of the board, which listed \u2018Gym class\u2019 next, and thought only about the coming class period.After class let out, Old Wu was still worried about the two worst students in the year so he called both of them over. \u201cBoth of you, stay a while. Did you understand the questions I went over in class?\u201dThe question wasn\u2019t difficult, so Xie Yu said thoughtfully, \u201cI understood.\u201dHe Zhao said, \u201cMe too.\u201dOld Wu didn\u2019t believe it at all. \u201cDid you understand?!\u201d\u201cI already told you. If you don\u2019t understand, don\u2019t pretend you do. Don\u2019t think that I don\u2019t know your next class period is gym and you just want to go down to the court and play, right?\u201d\u201cNo, I really\u2026\u201dOld Wu mercilessly cut them off. \u201cI know all your little tricks. I\u2019m going to go over this question again with you.\u201dXie Yu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe Zhao: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dOnce Old Wu explained the question and left, Luo Wenqiang picked up where he left off during the last break and started blustering again. \u201cAnyone have any thoughts? Anyone else want to join?\u201dLiu Cunhao and the others already regularly teamed up, but for a real competition Luo Wenqiang was trying his utmost to win a prize for their class. Luo Wenqiang continued, hinting, \u201cThis is what I think. If Yu-ge can play support and Zhao-ge plays a bit more sincerely with a few less tricks, our class should make it to the finals.\u201dThe implication of his words was clear.Xie Yu had just been force-fed a life philosophy of, \u2018It\u2019s fine not to know. Don\u2019t pretend to know if you don\u2019t,\u2019 by Old Wu and was very exhausted. He said coldly, \u201cThen you can keep thinking.\u201dHe Zhao said, \u201cI think my deskmate is right.\u201dLuo Wenqiang was speechless. \u201c\u2026Aren\u2019t you two going a bit overboard?\u201dOn hearing the first bit about \u2018Yu-ge playing support,\u2019 Liu Cunhao had already concluded this plan was a no-go. \u201cYou might as well hope for me, your teammate, to suddenly improve by leaps and bounds and become Erzhong\u2019s Liu Chuanfeng.\u201d\u00b9Luo Wenqiang\u2019s expression was complicated. \u201cHao-zi, you can get lost.\u201dHe Zhao was completely uninterested in the tournament. He was fine playing a game with friends, but competition was no fun.\u201cReally, I\u2019ll pass.\u201d He Zhao gave a half-smile. \u201cWatch out for the team from Class 4.\u201dThe timetable had changed for the new term and Class 3 now had gym class at the same time as Class 4.Before class started, the courtyard was already full of people who sat here and there on the track, forming small clusters. It wasn\u2019t clear at a glance who belonged to which class.The sun shone down, so bright it was blinding. Xie Yu sat behind He Zhao so He Zhao would block the sun for him and glanced down at his phone, replying to Madam Gu\u2019s text.How have you been? Remember to eat and don\u2019t stay up late.Mm.Xie Yu typed out the word. His phone still reflected some sunlight, so he leaned forward a little more. His forehead made contact with He Zhao\u2019s back and he felt He Zhao laugh, his chest heaving slightly.Then he replied, Got it. I\u2019m doing quite well.While they were chatting, Class 4 walked over, carrying their balls. They passed by the little group of Class 3 students, then stopped and glanced at them. \u201cWho\u2019s signed up from your class?\u201dBefore anyone could reply, they continued, \u201cSee you on the court.\u201dLiang Hui walked right at the back. He was not wearing the school uniform and a rebellious metal chain hung carelessly at his waist, a cross hanging from the slender chain. He didn\u2019t say anything, but when he walked past, he silently turned back and looked at them again.Last semester, they had gotten into a disagreement with Class 4 on the court, but Luo Wenqiang and the others hadn\u2019t taken the matter to heart.Luo Wenqiang watched them go and thought something seemed off. He scratched his head. \u201cWhat was that about?\u201dXie Yu finished replying and looked up just in time to meet Liang Hui\u2019s dark eyes.Then he saw Liang Hui raise one hand and give him the middle finger. He only held it up for a moment and it was not clear who he was gesturing at.There was still nearly a month before the basketball tournament.Erzhong\u2019s tournament did not follow the standard rules. In order to save time, the matches were shortened.To prepare for the basketball tournament, Luo Wenqiang increased the intensity of training. Not only during gym class and lunch break, but even in the ten minutes between class periods, he led the basketball team downstairs to practice.He Zhao and Xie Yu both weren\u2019t participating, but when they had time, they still practised with the others and acted as their \u2018opponents.\u2019\u201cHao-zi, I think you\u2019re not only good at running, your throwing skills are also incredible.\u201d He Zhao stopped and wiped his face with his collar. \u201cYou landed every basket yesterday, but today you play like your arm is broken?\u201dTheir class had big dreams, but the basketball team was actually not very good.Liu Cunhao, especially, did not perform consistently. When he played well, he did everything well, but when he was not in top form, he couldn\u2019t land a basket for anything. Class 3 had already prepared to drop out in the first round.Unexpectedly, they won narrowly in the first round and entered the second.Xie Yu stopped and asked, \u201cHave the matches for the second round been decided? Which class are we up against?\u201dLuo Wenqiang said, \u201cNot yet. They\u2019re drawing lots tomorrow before the match.\u201dClass 3 had bad luck and drew Class 4 as their second round opponent.While drawing lots, Mad Dog was repeating over the intercom, \u201c\u2014All students participating in the basketball tournament, meet on the courts at 12 noon.\u201dLuo Wenqiang opened the folded piece of paper and saw the stark number on it: 4.Class 3 was sitting in the audience stands to the side, cheering them on. The stands were filled and even students from the other years had come to join in the fun, chattering and making a racket.The referee took the paper and reported the name of Class 4. Liang Hui and the others got up and walked to the middle of the court.When the referee blew his whistle, Xie Yu felt his right eyelid twitch.Then the feeling that something was wrong grew more and more intense.At the start of the match, Class 3 had the advantage. Luo Wenqiang snatched the ball, then was about to pass to Liu Cunhao when the boy wearing the No.6 jersey stuck to Luo Wenqiang and wouldn\u2019t leave.Where the referee couldn\u2019t see, he shoved Luo Wenqiang.Wan Da got the ball and was about to throw when Liang Hui jumped up in front of him. Not only did he try to beat the ball back down, he even intentionally collided with Liu Cunhao, causing an \u2018accidental injury.\u2019There were many people on the court and both of them had moved quickly. With the constant crowding, attack and defense, and confrontation, Xie Yu nearly thought that these little movements that had happened in the blink of an eye had just been his imagination.But it wasn\u2019t just twice.When they were fighting over the rebound ball, he saw Liang Hui deliberately send his elbow in the direction of Liu Cunhao\u2019s eye.Liu Cunhao let go in pain, and clutched onto his eye as he squatted down.The referee blew his whistle.Their underhanded tactics were very stealthy. They did it with their backs to the referee and shielded each other from view. Xie Yu\u2019s mind was filled with the single word, \u2018Fuck,\u2019 and a vein jumped violently at his temple.He had heard He Zhao say that this team played dirty but he had not imagined they were this shameless.In front of Class 4, all the preparation Luo Wenqiang and the others had done for a month for this basketball tournament now seemed like a joke.\u201cRef, they broke the rules again! Who plays basketball like that? What are you trying to do?\u201dIn just a short ten minutes, many of these occurrences happened. Luo Wenqiang tried to endure it but he finally had enough.Liang Hui spread his hands and said innocently, \u201cSorry, it really was an accident.\u201dAlthough Liang Hui was not especially good at making friends and many people didn\u2019t like him, a basketball tournament was a team event and played on group spirit. Class 4 all spoke up for him and one girl was especially loud. \u201cWe didn\u2019t break the rules\u2026\u201dXu Qingqing exploded on the spot. She turned and said, \u201cAre you blind?\u201dXie Yu couldn\u2019t sit still either. But before he could get up, he saw He Zhao slowly screw the cap back onto his bottle of mineral water before throwing it.The bottle was still more than half full. When it landed on the raised edge of the stairs, it made a loud bang, then landed on the rubber floor.The classes, still fighting, were shocked by the noise and instantly quieted.He Zhao\u2019s face was thunderous. Ever since Luo Wenqiang had pulled the number 4, his gaze had grown darker and darker.After tossing the bottle, He Zhao stood up and stripped off his uniform jacket without another word. Inside, he wore only a short-sleeved shirt. He tossed his jacket to the side. \u201c\u2014Hao-zi, come back.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re substituting.\u201dThe other people in the audience knew that Xie Yu of the West Building killed people without batting an eye. He Zhao, in the legends, was a little easier to get along with. But looking at him now, he didn\u2019t seem easy to get along with at all.The name of \u2018school tyrant\u2019 was not an empty title. He gave off an air so overbearing, one did not even dare breathe too hard.Liang Hui had hit Liu Cunhao very hard, and Liu Cunhao was still on the ground and had not recovered. He clutched his eye with one hand and watched through blurry vision as He Zhao climbed over the divider and walked onto the basketball court.Liu Cunhao remembered He Zhao, with an aura of tyranny, holding Goody-two-shoes Yang on the toilet and rubbing his face on the ground. But this time He Zhao\u2019s aura seemed completely different from before.He Zhao took two steps, then stopped. Without looking back, he called out, \u201cOld Xie, are you coming?\u201dThen Liu Cunhao saw the grandpa from their class\u2014who hated being bothered, who refused point-blank to join the competition and who announced publicly that he wouldn\u2019t play support\u2014 also stand up.Xie Yu folded up his sleeves and replied, \u201cI\u2019m coming.\u201dLooking at them, one might have thought they were going to a fight.Class 3 was the first to react.A rush of adrenaline and pride enveloped them. Their morale, which Class 4 had previously beaten down, lifted again. Their hearts beat wildly.Liu Cunhao took heart from the momentum and he yelled back as he left the court, \u201cClass 4, you\u2019re asking for it.\u201d[]Translation notes: [1] Liu Chuanfeng: CN name for Rukawa Kaede from the anime Slam Dunk.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He dribbled the ball several times and his feelings were indiscernible from his tone of voice. He said, \u201cKeep breaking them.\u201dXie Yu said nothing.He jumped right over the guard rail, bracing his hands on the rail and pushing himself off and over it. Amidst the shouting, he walked neither slowly nor briskly toward Class 3\u2019s team.The two teams stood face to face.He Zhao tossed the ball to Class 4 and it landed next to Liang Hui\u2019s foot.When Liang Hui said he was not afraid of the school tyrants, he was definitely lying.Although he was a loud voice in his own class, he only dared be loud on his home ground. Typical bully who picked on the weak and feared the strong. But under the audience\u2019s gaze, with so many pairs of eyes staring at him, his rapidly swelling pride and competitiveness made him forget about all of that.The referee blew his whistle another few times. He stood in between the two teams, keeping them apart for fear they would start fighting. The audience was still fanning the flames and blindly raving.Class 4 was also completely riled up. They stood and yelled, \u201cHui-ge, go!\u201dThe referee was getting a headache. \u201cYou all calm down. What are you doing? Are you playing basketball or fighting? \u2026The competition is secondary. Friendship comes first.\u201dAt first, Liang Hui didn\u2019t understand He Zhao\u2019s words of, \u2018Keep breaking them.\u2019But when He Zhao and the rest of the re-assembled team stood to the side, finished their last-minute tactical discussion, and rejoined the court, he finally understood. So what if you break the rules?We won\u2019t even give you a chance to break the rules.He Zhao had watched for ten minutes from the audience stands and had gotten the gist of the tricks Class 4 was playing. \u201cLater, back uph Old Xie\u2026 He\u2019s good at breaking through a line, and he\u2019s fast at offense, but he\u2019s not a team player when he gets going so we can forget about working together\u2026 Don\u2019t get in his way or you might get hurt. Gym rep, you spot No.6 and I\u2019ll spot Liang Hui. We won\u2019t let them get away.\u201dThey couldn\u2019t cure the referee\u2019s blindness, so they had to prevent Class 4 from gathering together to hide each other\u2019s rulebreaking and earn their points back in the second half.Luo Wenqiang was shocked by He Zhao\u2019s acute observations of the match. He froze for a couple seconds, then kept nodding. \u201cSure. I\u2019ll keep an eye out. I won\u2019t let Yu-ge hurt me.\u201dXie Yu wasn\u2019t too happy and frowned. \u201cMe?\u201d\u201cWhat about you?\u201d He Zhao rested one hand on Xie Yu\u2019s neck, drew closer, and said, \u201cYou, solo player, eternal lone wolf\u2026 don\u2019t think about it.\u201dNow that He Zhao was on the field, he put together an aggressive plan of attack. Xie Yu led the show. Class 4 had never met such a powerful attack before and momentarily couldn\u2019t react.He Zhao had his eye on Liang Hui, who could only watch with his eyes wide as Xie Yu got the ball and passed two people, not giving anyone else a chance to get close at all.His attack was so relentless even two people ganging up couldn\u2019t block it.\u201cHui-ge!\u201dNo.6 from Class 3 had taken great pains to break free from Luo Wenqiang\u2019s guard, but still didn\u2019t make it to Xie Yu in time to block him. In a panic, he yelled, \u201cBlock him!\u201dLiang Hui cursed and thought, Block, my ass. He Zhao was guarding him like he was guarding a thief and he couldn\u2019t get past at all.The ball landed true. The moment it fell through the net, all of Class 3 in the audience stand stood up and cheered.Xie Yu wasn\u2019t that bad of a team player.Since they had started preparing for the basketball tournament nearly a month ago, he had played several matches with them. In that time, Luo Wenqiang\u2019s defensive tactics had improved by leaps and bounds from training one-on-one with Xie Yu for several matches.Xie Yu had landed a basket. He took two steps backward and ended up right next to He Zhao, and they exchanged a high-five.He Zhao pulled at his collar, fanning himself, and smiled. \u201cMy little friend is so cool.\u201dXie Yu changed his position and prepared to go on the defense. He said, in a low voice only the two of them could hear, \u201c\u2026My boyfriend is very cool too.\u201dLuo Wenqiang had nearly twisted his ankle. Now, standing beneath the hoop, he flexed his ankle during the short break. He noticed his eyes were a little wet. Damn. This is a man\u2019s hot blood.\u201cYu-ge! Cool!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re so cool! Go get them!\u201dHearing these calls, Liang Hui silently sneered. His chest heaved and he bent over slightly, dribbling the ball, his gaze dark. \u201cFuck.\u201dClass 3 was on the defense and Class 4 was starting to take the lead.Liang Hui took the ball and attacked. He thought he could turn the game around, but he did not expect Xie Yu to defend using offense and snatch the ball right out of his hands. Xie Yu did not even bother with blocking him and skipped right past that step.After this happened twice, Liang Hui gradually came to understand Class 3\u2019s war tactics. Two people could not block Xie Yu, so they would try three. \u201cBlock him! Fucking damn it! Block Xie Yu and we can deal with everyone else.\u201dLiang Hui had calculated well. He wanted to handle Xie Yu and maintain the current point disparity between the two teams. This way, he could suppress Class 3 and they would not catch up too quickly.But this landed him square in He Zhao\u2019s trap.Class 4 had thought Xie Yu was the main offense and He Zhao was the rear guard who directed the team. But after they guarded Xie Yu, He Zhao took over this round of offense.He Zhao was good at feinting and tactics. He played like he was toying with them and, over several rounds, he brought their score back up.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dIn the audience stand, only Class 3 was cheering now. Class 4\u2019s morale was dropping lower and lower.\u201cGood play.\u201d Xie Yu was sweating and he pulled the zipper on his jacket low, the zip getting stuck at his chest. Then he remembered to look at the scoreboard on the sidelines. \u201cStill short one point.\u201dHe Zhao said, \u201cJust need another minute.\u201dThere was half a minute left on the clock and they were short just one basket.Class 3 picked up the pace.Nobody noticed that while Liang Hui was defending, he also threw a weird glance at the person in the No.6 jersey. No.6 quietly nodded. He had still been blocking Xie Yu, but now he screamed, backed away, and fell onto the floor.From the ground, No.6 yelled, \u201cReferee, he ran into me!\u201dLiang Hui said, \u201cHe ran into him holding the ball!\u201dXie Yu had not imagined they really would be this shameless. \u201cYou fucking\u2026\u201d\u201cSo you stopped breaking the rules and started playing fake injuries instead. You all fake it pretty well, huh.\u201d He Zhao took the ball from Xie Yu and then stopped. \u201dSay it again? Who ran into you?\u201dThe situation was out of control. Both classes came down from the audience stand and joined the group, pushing and shoving each other.\u201cDon\u2019t fight! Don\u2019t use force! Friendship first!\u201d The referee blew his whistle several times but couldn\u2019t regain control over the chaos. Whistle in mouth, he yelled again, \u201c\u2014Friendship first!\u201dTwenty minutes later.The two classes stood outside Mad Dog\u2019s office, two long lines in the corridor.\u201cWhat happened with you two classes, huh?! Basketball is so exciting that the whole court isn\u2019t enough for you to show off? What is the meaning of this? Do we have to set up a boxing ring for you all? Organize a free-for-all fighting tournament?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dMad Dog had been on his way to a conference room for a meeting and had all his things packed up. He had not expected something to happen at the basketball tournament again. This time, it wasn\u2019t just a conflict between two teams. It was two whole classes, 40-odd students, fighting.After Mad Dog had gotten in a few words, Class 4, dissatisfied, started yelling, \u201cThey started it first\u2026\u201dXie Yu was annoyed beyond belief by this lot and was about to retort when He Zhao nudged him with an arm. \u201cDon\u2019t say any more.\u201d\u201cYou haven\u2019t had enough?\u201d Mad Dog\u2019s face was thunderous and he brought out the words he had used many times last year. \u201cBasketball tournament? To hell with it. You can forget about it from now on. Go on, run off and kick shuttlecocks now\u2014\u201dThe two of them stood at the end of the line. Xie Yu finally realized what He Zhao had meant by, \u2018Don\u2019t say any more.\u2019Mad Dog had taken great pains to bring back the basketball tournament for them, but now this had happened.Several gusts of wind blew through the corridor and the breeze made Xie Yu very alert.Class 3 all kept their heads bowed and stayed quiet while Mad Dog kept yelling at them, getting fiercer all the time, as if they were really in the wrong.Mad Dog nearly had an aneurysm. Next class period was about to start and he did not want to keep the two classes from attending lessons, so he steadied himself and eventually said, \u201cYou all reflect on yourselves. Go back and write a reflection essay each. Turn it in tomorrow morning at my office. Two thousand words. If even a single word is short you can carry your heads in your hands when you come to see me.\u201dMad Dog left. The two classes had also gotten sick of staring at each other. Xie Yu was about to go back downstairs when he heard Liang Hui sneer behind them.Xie Yu\u2019s footsteps paused.He Zhao held on to him, worried that with his little friend\u2019s hot temper he would throw Liang Hui on the ground without another word. \u201cThat\u2019s enough. Old Tang\u2019s class is next.\u201dBut Liang Hui drawled in a weird tone, \u201cYour Old Tang, who got fired from a prominent school for harassing a student.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe Zhao let go. \u201cWhat the hell are you bullshitting about?\u201dWhen Old Tang had transferred to Erzhong last semester, it had been a hot discussion topic that spawned all kinds of rumors.Some said Erzhong had paid a lot for him to come over but there was also a version of the story where he had done something wrong at his former school. That version had been popular on the school forum for a while, then the moderators deleted it. The story had come and gone like the wind and nobody thought it was true.Liang Hui tossed this dirty water, but once he was done, he didn\u2019t have the backbone to really fight them outside the student affairs office.Just now, he had already suffered on the basketball court. Xie Yu\u2019s flying fist had caught him in the stomach and he was still in some pain. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got the guts, when school\u2019s dismissed tomorrow evening, don\u2019t leave.\u201dXie Yu raised his eyebrows. The way Liang Hui picked a fight sounded very familiar, and he was about to reply, \u2018Where?\u2019 when Liang Hui rattled off the name of a game, a place, and a time.\u201c\u2014Genesis, 9 p.m. at night! Cliff of Lost Love! See if your class has the guts to show up!\u201dAll of Class 3: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dGenesis was an MMO that had gotten popular over the last couple of years. It spread through all the schools like wildfire and nearly everyone had an account.Xie Yu remembered that during summer vacation, Zhou Dalei had been obsessed with Genesis and had gone out to pick a fight with someone over a violet weapon. He had accidentally met He Zhao there and they had sat face to face in the police station writing reflection essays.Looking at Liang Hui\u2019s face, Xie Yu found himself growing more and more unsure what kind of shit was contained in this idiot\u2019s head.[]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 5": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fake Slackers096 \u2013 Say that one more time and I\u2019ll go offline.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayFake SlackersTranslator: JuryEditor: NomNomFirst Published on Chaleuria\u2014096 \u2013 Say that one more time and I\u2019ll go offline.The next day happened to be Saturday.Although Liang Hui\u2019s suggestion was idiotic, one had to admit it was fairly \u2018civilized.\u2019 After all, if they really fought, it would be Old Tang and Mad Dog who would have to clean up their mess.So Luo Wenqiang took the lead and accepted this war declaration on behalf of Class 3. \u201cYou\u2019re on! We\u2019re not afraid of you!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAs they had caused a disturbance, Classes 3 and 4 were both eliminated from the tournament and their progress was invalidated. During literature class, Old Tang took some class time to educate them. \u201cIn all things, don\u2019t be rash. Not all problems have to be solved by rushing up and using your fists. You\u2019re not children any more and you have to take responsibility for your actions\u2026\u201dThe class was dead silent.Old Tang thought they were silent and furiously looking down intoat their lapspants as a display of shame, and he could not help but soften his tone. \u201cConsider this incident a lesson, and I hope this will not happen again.\u201dXie Yu had had no time to sleep during lunch break. Now he pushed a thick stack of books to the middle of his desk and hid behind them to nap.He Zhao elbowed him. \u201cCheck the class group chat.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dXie Yu did not open his eyes, his face still buried in the crook of his elbow. He felt around under his desk for a while before finding his phone. Without changing his posture, he reluctantly opened his eyes and tapped on the unread notification.[Luo Wenqiang]: Who\u2019s joining? Put your name down and join our class guild. I just got someone to set it up. It\u2019s called \u2018Class 4, kneel down and cry uncle.\u2019[Xu Jing]: Good name! Simple, violent, and aggressive. It fits our class spirit very well.[Xu Qingqing]: Count me in.[Wan Da]: I went to eavesdrop. The class next door has 5 clerics, four mages, and the rest are all assassins. I don\u2019t know what class Liang Hui\u2019s going to play. He has three accounts\u2026Seeing Class 3 raring to go online and fight, Xie Yu was getting a headache. \u201cThey\u2019re serious?\u201dIf they fought face to face, the warzone wouldn\u2019t be that big. But now that the format had been changed to a game, they would have universal participation. Everyone who had an account was itching to rub the faces of the class next door into the ground.During the four afternoon class periods, everyone\u2019s minds were clearly elsewhere. All of them just wanted to go home and play video games. When the class dismissal bell rang, Liu Cunhao was the first to pack up his things, pick up his bag, and rush out. \u201cBye, bros! I have to rush home and practice my combos. See you online\u2014\u201dXie Yu was leaning on the railing in the corridor, on a phone call. Madam Gu said a few more words on the other end. The corridor was noisy and he didn\u2019t hear properly, and only said, \u2018Mm,\u2019 several times.Liu Cunhao waved as he passed him. \u201cSee you, Yu-ge!\u201dLiu Cunhao was going very fast and the water bottle he had stuffed in his bag\u2019s side pocket was pushed out. It wobbled and He Zhao braced his arms on the windowsill and called to him, \u201cHao-zi, your bottle.\u201dGu Xuelan was saying something when she heard the noisy footsteps over the phone. It was the noise of a school: clamoring, racket, and the sound of boys talking, full of life.Xie Yu waited for a while and didn\u2019t hear Madam Gu say anything more. \u201cMom?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d Gu Xuelan recovered, then reminded him, \u201cTake care on your way back.\u201dFor the two weekend days he would spend at home, Xie Yu took several exercise books, then thought about it, and put another mock paper into his bag. He was about to zip up his bag when he felt a cool sensation at his neck.He Zhao had worked up a sweat playing basketball earlier and he felt uncomfortable, so after school he had gone back to the dormitory and taken a quick shower.He bent slightly at the waist and rested his chin on Xie Yu\u2019s shoulder. His hair dripped water. \u201cI won\u2019t see my little friend for two days and I miss him already.\u201dXie Yu pulled his zipper up and turned as he spoke. \u201cI haven\u2019t even left\u2014\u201dHis words were cut off halfway.When he turned around, He Zhao was already in position to lean down and kiss him.He brought with him a faint chill as he drew closer, catching Xie Yu off guard.It had just been a kiss with no other intent behind it. He just couldn\u2019t bear to let his little friend go. He had completely forgotten that the moment he touched Xie Yu he would lose control.The sensation of losing control was even more intense than it had been on the basketball court that afternoon. When Xie Yu opened his eyes again, the edge of the desk digging painfully into his back. His school pants were pulled down to his tailbone and hung there loosely.\u201cYou\u2019re hard.\u201d He Zhao deliberately touched him through the fabric. \u201cBeg me?\u201dXie Yu hummed softly. His fingers threaded lightly through He Zhao\u2019s hair, getting a handful of wetness.He Zhao had told Xie Yu to beg him, but he still reached out to loosen Xie Yu\u2019s waistband and reached in to help him. Xie Yu realized that He Zhao was going to finish him up and then go, and his half-lidded eyes flew open. In a low voice, he asked, \u201c\u2026you\u2019re not going to do it?\u201dSince Xie Yu\u2019s birthday, they had not gone too far. Even though He Zhao was so hard he couldn\u2019t bear it, at the very last step he would still force himself to let go of Xie Yu.He Zhao was worried Xie Yu would be in pain, and worried he had not yet recovered, and his little friend still had to ride the bus home, so it wouldn\u2019t be right. \u201cYou\u2019re not going home? You\u2019re going to stay the night here with me?\u201dXie Yu let go of the back of He Zhao\u2019s head and braced himself against the side of the desk. Putting that distance between them made him a little more clear-headed.He Zhao asked, \u201cTomorrow night, Lost Love Cliff. Are you going?\u201d\u201cGoing, my ass. I\u2019m not going.\u201dXie Yu didn\u2019t dare imagine what it would be like. \u201cIt\u2019s too stupid.\u201dA certain someone had said it was stupid and he was not going, but after he got home, he saw that the time of the showdown between the two classes was growing closer. He hesitated for a while, then logged into his old game account, the one called \u2018X.\u2019Xie Yu had no extraordinary interest in games like Genesis. He had only registered an account because Zhou Dalei had staked his life on it. I guarantee on my worthless life that it\u2019s really fun! If it\u2019s not, you can cut my head off and kick it like a football!But Xie Yu had not played for very long. His account was still on level 46 and most of the skill tree was still locked.Xie Yu looked down and texted He Zhao. Do you have a spare account?He Zhao replied very quickly. Yes. Hold on a sec.Xie Yu exited the PM interface and found that the class group was still discussing tonight\u2019s battle. They were much more fervent than when they discussed studying on a usual day.Class 3\u2019s group chat was full of activity for a while before an incomprehensible @ suddenly emerged.[a\uff1d(Vt-Vo)/t]: What game is this?Xue Xisheng asked twice. After getting an answer, he moved his mouse, found the official Genesis site, and clicked download.When He Zhao sent the account username and password over, he also commented, Our class rep is actually breaking his record of 17 years of not touching online games.Xie Yu thought: not only is he breaking a record, the study rep once said that online games are the most pointless things, like emotional opium for teens, and would only hinder his studying time.He Zhao had given him a max-level warrior with a melee focus.It was good in every way, but\u2026\u201cWhat kind of name is this?\u201d Xie Yu placed a call and before He Zhao could get a word in he continued to say, \u201cAre you sick?\u201dOn his computer monitor was a berserker tattooed from his chest to his shoulders, an impressive appearance with a green dragon saber in its hand. But atop its head was a name that could not possibly get more idiotic: \u2570\u2192 I\u2019ll get addicted to thinking of you.He Zhao had not noticed what was amiss. He was never serious when he named his avatars. When Xie Yu had asked him for one, he had only just remembered to change the name quickly. \u201cCouple names. Look at mine.\u201dHe Zhao\u2019s avatar was an assassin, dressed in black from head to foot, only a pair of eyes showing through the hood. Over its head: \ufe4fEnchanted with love for you\u3006Xie Yu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dMost of Class 3 was already online, using every last bit of time to practice co-op. More and more members of the guild came online.When the study rep appeared under the handle \u2018PleaseDontGetAddictedToGames,\u2019 Class 3 went silent.Soon after, the idiot pair of lovers appeared in the guild member list and all of Class 3 went silently mad.Everyone had different online handles and for a while they couldn\u2019t tell who was who, so they swapped back to the class group chat to talk. It was easier to strategize like that later, too.Xu Qingqing\u2019s house was noisy\u2014they were probably still eating dinner. When she got online, she said, \u201cForget about the study rep. Who are these two idiots?\u201dWan Da put on his earphones and said, \u201cProbably joined the wrong guild.\u201dLiu Cunhao asked, \u201cAre they dumb dicks?!\u201d\u201cMe and Old Xie,\u201d He Zhao said. \u201cAnyone have issues?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, no, we wouldn\u2019t dare.\u201d Liu Cunhao had thought it wasn\u2019t someone from their class. When he heard He Zhao, he tried to rescind the words \u2018dumb dicks.\u2019 He racked his brains and said awkwardly, \u201cActually, those names\u2026 they sound kind of high-class.\u201dXie Yu tamped down very hard on the impulse to kick He Zhao from this end of the corridor to the far end when he saw him on Monday, and joined the team fight with the idiotic handle \u2570\u2192 I\u2019ll get addicted to thinking of you.Liu Cunhao had been class rep for two years and brought his natural leadership charisma into the game. He had not practiced his game skills much, but he led everyone around in formation for half an hour.\u201cNo matter our skill level, we must put up a strong front. We have to suppress them from the beginning.\u201d Liu Cunhao spoke confidently into the mic. \u201cWarriors, stand in front. Mages stay back, and clerics in the rear. Form up. I\u2019ll count down, 3, 2, 1. Everyone walk forward\u2026\u201dThe 20+ people made a 4\u00d76 rectangular formation.To one side of the formation, a warrior with the handle \u2570\u2192 I\u2019ll get addicted to thinking of you was not moving. Through the visor, his avatar\u2019s gaze seemed to be a little cold.Liu Cunhao kept repeating, \u201c3, 2, 1.\u201d In the chaos, He Zhao called, \u201cOld Xie, let\u2019s go.\u201dXie Yu turned on his mic. \u201cSay that one more time and I\u2019ll go offline.\u201dClass 4 had named their guild \u2018Class 3 are our grandsons.\u2019 At 9 p.m. sharp, a crowd had amassed on Lost Love Cliff.The so-called fight had no finesse to speak of. There were too many people. It was just a brawl.But when Class 3 showed off their 4\u00d76 formation missing one person, Class 4 was still shocked.\u201cThe mage on that side is hurt! Someone stab him!\u201d\u201cCleric, heal me! I\u2019m about to die! Cleric, look at me!\u201d\u201cSomeone go and block that idiot! Someone guard him!\u201dEveryone was yelling in the group chat and no one noticed that a new Level 5 account with the handle \u2018PleaseDontGetAddictedToGames\u2019 had taken a few skill hits from the enemy and his health bar was almost empty.Until Xue Xisheng turned on his mic and asked, \u201cHow do you heal?\u201d[]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There was a very simple reason for its popularity: if someone couldn\u2019t beat their opponent, they didn\u2019t have to die under the enemy\u2019s sword. They could just jump off the cliff.One must die with dignity.The showdown between \u2018Class 4 kneel down and cry uncle\u2019 and \u2018Class 3 are my grandsons\u2019 quickly gained steam and drew a big audience.\u201cLower right corner, inventory,\u201d He Zhao said. \u201cGym rep, hide in the back. If you can\u2019t make it, jump off the cliff. Hao-zi, go up and help guard him for a while\u2026 which one on that side is Liang Hui? I\u2019ll deal with him.\u201dHe Zhao had already collected several heads since the battle had commenced. His tactics were underhanded and he moved on the battlefield with ease.Liu Cunhao rushed up and guarded the new Level 5 account with his own avatar. \u201cYour Old Xie is already dealing with him.\u201d\u2570\u2192 I\u2019ll get addicted to thinking of you was leading a solo onslaught against the enemy camp.Although Xie Yu had not played this game for a long time, Zhou Dalei had spent all his free time looking up new combos and showing off to Xie Yu. \u201cBoss Xie, look at this combo. I\u2019m calling it the Blade of Lei-zai. What do you think?\u201dXie Yu was merciless. \u201cI think it\u2019s tacky.\u201dZhou Dalei: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dLiang Hui was so boxed in by the warrior with the idiotic handle , he couldn\u2019t move. In the short span of five minutes, Class 4\u2019s numbers were half-depleted.The back and forth was so intense that for a while, no one could see the game background. The screen was filled with skill effects.\u201cHe\u2019s badly hurt. One more.\u201dBefore the people around him could react to what he said, Xie Yu continued, \u201cHe\u2019s dead.\u201dLiang Hui had good equipment. He had probably spent all his in-game effort on acquiring expensive equipment, but although his avatar looked resplendent, he didn\u2019t actually use it very well.By this time, Xue Xisheng had finally taken a healing potion. After recovering HP, he used several skills that did basically 0 damage, showing off a new Level 5 account\u2019s determination.Twenty minutes later\u2014\u2014A system alert. \u2018Class 4 kneel down and cry uncle\u2019 has defeated \u2018Class 3 are my grandsons.\u2019This victory was damn sweet. Liu Cunhao\u2019s voice was hoarse from yelling, but in the moment of victory he shouted, \u201cVictory, my brothers! We\u2019ve won!\u201dLiu Cunhao\u2019s loud shouting was giving Xie Yu a headache. He reached to pull off his earphones, but not before hearing an even louder string of curses. \u201cDo you want to die? Have you finished your homework? You\u2019re playing games?\u201dLiu Cunhao had yelled so loudly his dad and mom had come looking. They pushed open his door and started scolding him.Liu Cunhao was scolded into submission. He said, more quietly, \u201cMom, just ten more minutes\u2026 I swear, it\u2019s true.\u201dOn another line, another parent was saying something unexpected.\u201cYou\u2019re done? You could play a little longer with your classmates. This game looks pretty fun. Should you buy some equipment? I saw other kids buying it\u2026 If you want something, just buy it. Mom will give you money.\u201d All of Class 3 was shocked speechless by this parent.Then they heard Xue Xisheng say helplessly, \u201cMom, no need. I\u2019m not playing any more. I\u2019m going to study vocab.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dLiu Cunhao really wanted to cry. \u201cHow can people\u2019s situations be so unequal?\u201dXie Yu, one hand still on the cord of his earphones, started laughing alongside the others in the chat. Aside from Liu Cunhao, who was still bemoaning the unfairness of fate, everyone else was laughing wildly.He smiled as he let go. He was about to exit the game when he heard someone from Class 4 say something in the public chat.We dare to gamble, so we dare to lose.We\u2019re sorry.Their class had proposed the competition in the first place, so now they had to admit defeat.Although they had bowed and admitted defeat, Class 4\u2019s guild chat was very different. Liang Hui was so mad his keyboard clacked as he typed, and only when he hit the enter key did he realize he had sent it to the wrong chat.A line suddenly appeared in the global chat.The class with the lowest average in the year. Of course they\u2019re good at video games. /Heh hehThe conflict between the two classes had started with the basketball tournament, but now it was getting more and more out of hand. They were at an age where their blood ran hot and they couldn\u2019t control their feelings.Xie Yu\u2019s hands stilled.This event had already upset him, and upon seeing these words\u00a0 he felt rage overwhelm him.Class 3\u2019s group chat went quiet. Then someone couldn\u2019t take it any longer and cursed. Then it exploded. \u201cWhat the hell do they mean by that?!\u201dBefore Class 3 could curse any more, a familiar, aesthetically unusual handle appeared in the global chat.\u2570\u2192 I\u2019ll get addicted to thinking of you: Do you want to die?Xie Yu had just sent it when a similarly styled handle appeared, too.\ufe4fEnchanted with love for you\u3006: The upcoming midterms. Open your dog eyes and see clearly who your father is.All of Class 3: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dClass 3 had never imagined the ones to talk trash first would be the two students whose grades were most worrying. Even Xue Xisheng hadn\u2019t yet said anything.The boast was an impossibly arrogant one. It was presumptuous, grand, and inexplicably made their blood run hot. But none of Class 3 let it get to their heads.Luo Wenqiang\u2019s voice was shaking. \u201cNo, really. You sound very cool saying that, but do you have to boast like that? Do you know what you\u2019re saying?\u201dWan Da siaid, \u201c\u2014Wake up! Please, you two, wake up!\u201dLiu Cunhao said, \u201cZhao-ge, you really shouldn\u2019t be too arrogant!\u201dThe mid-term exams were less than two weeks away.There had been one monthly exam since term started up again. In that monthly exam, these two students\u2014whose bottom-of-the-year positions even thunder could not move\u2014had pulled their scores up a little, although it wasn\u2019t much improvement.Class 3 was happy for the time being, but now they thought about the usual studying habits of their class\u2019s two big bros, and they had every reason to suspect they had just gotten lucky at blindly guessing answers.Class 3\u2019s reactions were too strong, and Xie Yu and He Zhao couldn\u2019t get a word in though they tried. With much effort, He Zhao finally managed to say in bits and pieces, \u201cIt\u2019s fine. Even if they have a 30-point head start we\u2019ll still win easily. Actually, Old Xie and I\u2026\u201dBefore he finished, Class 3 left the voice chat one by one.[Luo Wenqiang left the voice channel.][Liu Cunhao left the voice channel.]\u2026\u2026[Xie Yu]: ?[Liu Cunhao]: Goodbye. I heard \u201830\u2019 points and really can\u2019t go on. Even if they gave us a 30-point head start, we probably couldn\u2019t win. For the sake of our class dignity, I\u2019m going offline and I\u2019m going to study.[Wan Da]: I\u2019m going to study too.[Luo Wenqiang]: Studying.Everyone left, until only Xie Yu and He Zhao were left in the voice chat.He Zhao wasn\u2019t sure whether to laugh or to cry. At the start, he was just angry and was trash talking alongside his little friend. But now that he had said it, he had been planning to explain things to his classmates. Who would have expected that none of them were willing to listen? \u201cWhat happened to trusting your fellow man?\u201dHe Zhao was done being thoughtful. He called out, \u201cOld Xie.\u201d\u201cMm?\u201d\u201cThe plan from before. Gradual\u2026\u201dXie Yu exited the game, took out his earphones, and cut him off. \u201cGradual, my ass.\u201dLiang Hui\u2019s words still filled his head.Xie Yu was annoyed beyond belief and very enraged. All his worries about the burden of slackerdom were now burned clean away by the fire of anger. Only one thing remained in his mind: just beat the idiot and be done with it.He Zhao let go of his mouse and said, \u201cSure. Let\u2019s do it.\u201dThe class group was very quiet over the weekend and nearly nobody said anything. Some people emerged to ask the study rep homework questions, but when they were done, they vanished again.\u201cAlso, there\u2019s a bag on the table. Take it back to school with you when you go. Don\u2019t forget.\u201d Early Monday morning, Gu Xuelan drank a few mouthfuls of congee and then put down her spoon to continue talking to Xie Yu. \u201cThey\u2019re health products I bought you. To keep up your nourishment.\u201d\u201cGot it.\u201dXie Yu felt his phone vibrate. He opened the app and saw the study rep explaining a geometry question to Luo Wenqiang. He glanced at it, then put down his phone and continued eating breakfast.Gu Xuelan asked, \u201cA classmate?\u201d\u201cMm.\u201dTheir conversations often went like this. Before, Xie Yu would not have noticed anything amiss. He was taciturn by nature and would rather do than talk. But since he had hashed things out with Madam Gu, he had begun to pay more attention to what she meant.After a while, Xie Yu continued, \u201cOur study rep is explaining questions in the group chat. A few days ago\u2026\u201dXie Yu wasn\u2019t good at telling stories like these and covered the video game fight in several sentences, blandly delivered. But Madam Gu was still very happy to hear it and even asked out of curiosity, \u201cAnd he doesn\u2019t do anything else in his free time?\u201dXie Yu said, \u201cHis entire life consists of studying.\u201dThere was a traffic jam on the way back to school and by the time Xie Yu got to class the bell was about to ring. Class 3\u2019s classroom was so quiet it was a little strange. Very different from usual when he could hear his classmates making noise from a long way away.Xie Yu got to the rear door and saw that some words had been written on the rear blackboard. The words were large, red, bold, and went straight to the heart. Change our fate!\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe Zhao arrived late, too, and ran into Xie Yu in the doorway to the classroom. He stopped walking, one hand on the doorframe, then reached out and put an arm on Xie Yu\u2019s shoulder. He bent slightly and said, \u201cWhat are you waiting around for? You\u2019re not going in?\u201dHe Zhao glanced into the classroom and saw the words \u2018Change our fate.\u2019 \u201cWhat is this\u2026 the blackboard report for this semester?\u201dXie Yu asked, \u201cYou think the school would come up with such a topic?\u201dClass 3 was studying especially hard today. Everyone had their heads buried in their books. Wan Da walked in, having just finished cleaning duty, and He Zhao beckoned to him with a finger.Wan Da put down the cloth. In his other hand was a small vocabulary book. \u201cMorning, Zhao-ge.\u201dHe Zhao said, \u201cMorning. Friend, explain this?\u201d\u201cAh, Hao-zi wrote this,\u201d Wan Da said. \u201cHe said it would encourage everyone. We can\u2019t give up hope. This mid-term exam will be our last stand against the odds.\u201dClass 3 flatly refused to believe He Zhao and Xie Yu could get good grades of any sort. At most, they expected the two of them to accidentally get several more questions right, like on the last test, and it would still fall to the rest of them to pull up their class average themselves.In the morning, they gathered for an emergency class meeting. They imagined the worst-case scenario. Even though this goal was difficult to reach, it wasn\u2019t completely impossible.Liu Cunhao held a piece of paper in one hand, the other drawing circles on it with a pen. \u201cLet\u2019s imagine. If Zhao-ge scores 10 points this time around\u2026no, let\u2019s be more conservative. Let\u2019s go with 0 points! Then, each of us has to score another\u2026\u201dWan Da was about to go back to studying when he heard He Zhao say, \u201cWhat do you mean, against the odds? Old Xie and I have no issues getting a perfect score.\u201dEven the usually taciturn Xie Yu said, \u2018Mm,\u2019 in assent.Wan Da nearly tripped. All sorts of emotions were flowing through him. He had no idea where their sudden delusional self-confidence had come from. \u201cAre you both mad?! Are you dreaming? Please, wake up!\u201dXie Yu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe Zhao: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d[]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

We can win.Wan Da didn\u2019t give them a chance to speak. He kept repeating, \u201cPlease, wake up,\u201d the whole way back to his seat.Xie Yu stood in the doorway, his feelings complicated. \u201c\u2026We\u2019re wide awake.\u201dHe Zhao was still in the same pose, one arm hooked around Xie Yu\u2019s neck, stunned by Wan Da\u2019s words. \u201c\u2026Really, we\u2019re awake.\u201dHe yelled at Wan Da\u2019s departing back, \u201cTrust me! A perfect score isn\u2019t hard to get\u2026\u201dNow Wan Da was not the only person breaking down. Liu Cunhao nearly threw his English vocabulary handbook at the two of them. \u201cTrust what? There\u2019s no trust between us! If you get a perfect score, I\u2019ll eat my mid-term test!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe bell rang to signal the start of morning self-study and the various classrooms gradually quieted.The English teacher walked out of the faculty office holding a stack of books and saw two figures standing in Class 3\u2019s doorway. \u201c\u2014What are you two doing standing in the doorway? Get back to your seats. Class is starting, don\u2019t you know?\u201dXie Yu internally sighed and didn\u2019t keep quibbling with them on the topic. He walked to the last row and pulled out his chair.\u201cClass 3\u2019s studying hard today.\u201d The English teacher stepped into the classroom and immediately felt the unusual atmosphere. She bent over the computer and adjusted the listening comprehension file. \u201cYou\u2019re memorizing vocabulary so intently. Are you feeling the pressure of the midterms?\u201dThe English teacher increased the volume, then said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be so worried. Just take the midterm exams like you usually do. Adjust your expectations\u2026\u201dShe could never have imagined that Class 3 just wanted to compete with Class 4 next door. They\u2019d sworn an oath to get their own back.Xie Yu did one of the listening comprehension questions.He had gotten up at five something a.m. to catch the bus and started to get sleepy after two questions. He lay down on the desk, pen still held between his fingers, and the English letters he wrote grew messier and messier.He Zhao turned and saw his little friend with his eyes half-closed, looking very sleepy. Xie Yu did questions very quickly and ticked off his answer before the test finished asking the question.As Xie Yu ticked the answers off, he was thinking. He admitted to himself that he had left himself some wiggle room since entering high school. Sometimes, he would do half a question and give the subject teachers a little surprise. \u201cLook at this question. Didn\u2019t you figure out how to solve it? You should memorize the solution steps properly. Then you wouldn\u2019t get stuck after writing the beginning\u2026\u201dBut these careful little surprises had not left much of an impression on his classmates or the teachers.\u201cDo you have an extra pen?\u201d He Zhao asked.\u201cWhere\u2019s yours?\u201d\u201cI got used to\u2026 not bringing one.\u201dThe outcome of having acted for so long and gaining experience enough to be a pro at slacking off\u2026 was that Xie Yu went through the entire interior of his desk and did not find a second pen. He was still as poor as before.They stared at each other in silence. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dXie Yu looked away and nudged the student in front of him with his pen, about to ask if he had extra pens, but the student\u2014who was usually respectful of the two big bros in the back row\u2014was now being obstinate.Although he and his deskmate had sat in front of them for a long time, they still had an inexplicable feeling of respect and fear for the back row. At first, it had been fear of the bad reputation of the school tyrants. Now, it was gay panic.They really couldn\u2019t get any gayer than this.The guy in front didn\u2019t even turn around when Xie Yu poked him. \u201cBig bro, please don\u2019t disturb me while I\u2019m listening. This is a matter of life and death for our class. I can\u2019t get distracted.\u201dXie Yu pressed a hand to his forehead and fully gave up on the lot of them.The English teacher was very satisfied with Class 3\u2019s studious attitude, even if it seemed like a spell had been cast on them. After class, he packed up his things and walked out, but not before saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re possessed or what, but I hope Class 3 can continue like this\u2026\u201dThroughout the class period, aside from some students who put their heads together to discuss the questions, Class 3\u2019s classroom had remained very quiet.Several people lined up in front of the study rep\u2019s desk like they were visiting a clinic.Xue Xisheng calmly pushed up his glasses and helped Wan Da complete a solid geometry question. Pen still in hand, he said, \u201cNext.\u201dXu Qingqing respectfully walked up and placed her chemistry exercise book on Xue Xisheng\u2019s desk. \u201cMr. Xue, page 68, question 3. Could you help me?\u201dLuo Wenqiang, behind Xu Qingqing, used the wait time to memorize a few more math formulas.Xie Yu\u2019s thought process was simple. Since no one believed them, they might as well talk less and let their exam results speak for themselves.But He Zhao still refused to give up. With a languid air, one leg cocked, and looking very idle, he raised a hand and yelled to Luo Wenqiang, \u201c\u2014Gym rep.\u201dLuo Wenqiang looked up. \u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cWhich question is it?\u201d He Zhao asked. \u201cI\u2019ll teach you.\u201dLuo Wenqiang had wondered what He Zhao was going to say. When he heard this, he nearly choked. A feeling of suffocation engulfed him and he didn\u2019t let out that breath for a long time.While he was still trying to breathe, He Zhao added, \u201cIf you don\u2019t believe me, bring it over here and I\u2019ll do it for you to see.\u201dLuo Wenqiang: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAnticipating Luo Wenqiang\u2019s reaction, Xie Yu pulled on He Zhao\u2019s hem and said, \u201cForget it.\u201dHe Zhao whispered, \u201cI think I can still do some emergency resuscitation.\u201dXie Yu said, \u201c\u2026If you keep talking, I can\u2019t be sure who will need resuscitation.\u201dLuo Wenqiang really needed an ambulance right now.Bombs seemed to be going off inside his mind, exploding one after the other. You\u2019ll do it, my ass!Jerk!Ahhh!Eventually, Luo Wenqiang took a deep breath and declined. \u201cZhao-ge, it\u2019s like this. My time is very precious right now, and I can\u2019t waste even a second of it. Do you understand what I mean?\u201dHe Zhao said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you believe me? Qiang-qiang, can\u2019t we give each other a chance?\u201dHis response was Luo Wenqiang\u2019s resolutely departing silhouette.When Luo Wenqiang left, his footsteps were unsteady. He felt as if he were in a dream. Who am I? Where am I?Luo Wenqiang\u2019s strong reaction left an impact. Xie Yu let go of He Zhao\u2019s hem and leaned to one side. He couldn\u2019t help smiling.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d He Zhao scratched his head, and forgot about \u2018emergency resuscitation.\u2019 He wasn\u2019t sure what to say. \u201cIs it really so difficult for this lot to trust us?\u201dXie Yu said, \u201cGe, I think you need to learn when to give up.\u201dNext to the words \u2018Change our fate!\u2019 on the blackboard, they had even added a countdown to the mid-term exams. The whole class was getting more and more nervous because of the countdown.Old Tang tried to advise them to put down their textbooks and go outside more. \u201cWork and leisure accompany each other. Study, but to a point. You go on like this every day and don\u2019t even want to go to gym class any more. What are you doing?\u201dBut Class 3 now had iron determination and Old Tang couldn\u2019t move them though he tried.The only sounds on the day of the mid-term exams were of Mad Dog yelling over the intercom to the students to \u2018arrange the furniture in their classrooms and to proceed to their exam venues in half an hour,\u2019 and of chairs and tables being dragged.After two weeks of intensive studying, everybody in Class 3 looked tired.Liu Cunhao took a cloth and rubbed out the \u20181\u2019 on the blackboard, then gravely wrote down a 0 by the countdown.\u201cEverybody, steady.\u201d The bags under Liu Cunhao\u2019s eyes had been steadily growing over two weeks of late nights. Although he was tired, his eyes still resolutely shone. \u201cWe can win.\u201dAs Xie Yu moved his table and chair, he thought that this was less a last stand against the odds and more like they were riding in a small, broken-down boat, still trying desperately to row even as they were about to be drowned by a flood.\u2026\u2026Xie Yu and He Zhao had improved a little over the last two exams, but still had not escaped the fate of being assigned to the very last exam venue.The corridor was packed with people going to their exam venues, so crowded that even water might not be able to flow through between them.\u201cLike we said before, first place from the top.\u201d The stairwell exit was crowded. He Zhao stopped and looked at him. \u201cLet\u2019s compete?\u201dThe first exam was literature and Xie Yu had only brought two pencils and nothing else. He hadn\u2019t even brought an eraser. He didn\u2019t even consider that if he shaded the answer sheet wrong, he wouldn\u2019t be able to erase it.\u201cSure.\u201dXie Yu glanced down at his phone. When he looked up again, Liang Hui and some others were walking out of the bathrooms.Liang Hui had at some point dyed his hair. Several locks of red by his temple were striking and he smelled of cigarette smoke. His gaze was dark and inscrutable and he carelessly stuck his hands in his pockets.The intercom played exam announcements on repeat.The two groups of people watched each other, and in the end, they both ignored each other.\u201cStudents, please proceed to your designated exam venues. Students, please proceed to your designated exam venues. The exam will start in ten minutes. Please note the time.\u201d\u201cThe first exam is literature.\u201d\u201cThe exam will start in ten minutes.\u201dFor this round of mid-term tests, all the public high schools in A City wrote the questions together and the resulting test was more difficult than those of previous years.Before the exam started, someone in the poor students\u2019 gathering grounds had already put his head down and fallen asleep. By the time the invigilating teacher arrived, he had even started snoring.Several slow and long snores stopped the invigilating teacher\u2019s footsteps in its tracks.The invigilating teacher was a new face and he clearly had opinions about this exam venue. As he counted the exam papers, he frowned and looked around the classroom. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dPeople were doing all sorts of things. Some more daring students even messed with their phones, thinking they were being discreet.Unfocused with poor grades. Those were the monikers of this exam venue.The exam bell rang. The invigilating teacher passed the exam papers down column by column, from the head of the column to the end.The bell finally woke the snoring student, who rubbed his mouth and forced his eyes open.This room did not feel like an exam venue at all and did not have an atmosphere of tension.But Xie Yu felt his throat go dry.He took the paper and immediately rested his elbow on the paper to write his name. With his other hand, he passed the remaining exam papers backwards.Two strokes into the word \u2018Xie.\u2019He Zhao reached out and took the exam papers from Xie Yu\u2019s hand.[]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You have 120 minutes.\u201d\u201cStudents, please take note. You cannot have tools not relevant to the current exam with you\u2026\u201dThe invigilating teacher paced slowly around the classroom to the sound of the announcement.Xie Yu wrote his name and glanced through the paper.He had thought that the exam would be about as difficult as the monthly exams, but now he noticed two new question types.Then he noticed the box containing the paper-setters\u2019 names included several names of teachers not from Erzhong.Erzhong took this exam quite seriously. Four schools had banded together to create this exam and how their students did would directly correlate to how each school looked in the eyes of others. \u2026Although Erzhong did not have much of a reputation to begin with and their average refused to increase no matter what.Even on the final subject-specific grade sheets, not many students were able to break formation and move up to a higher row.\u00b9\u201cSo?\u201d After Xie Yu finished a few questions, He Zhao poked him in the back with his pencil. \u201cHow many points are you getting?\u201d\u201cAs many as I want.\u201dXie Yu calmly leaned backwards in his chair. \u201cWorried? Beg me and I\u2019ll give you a two-point head start.\u201dMany people were playing little tricks in the exam. Someone\u2019s paper wad didn\u2019t land right and fell into the space between the desks.He Zhao held his pen in his left hand, and tapped lightly on the back of Xie Yu\u2019s head. \u201c\u2026You\u2019re very arrogant, little friend. Beg me and I\u2019ll give you a 20-point head start.\u201dThe students in the last exam room were all busy passing answers and had no idea what the two bottom-of-the-year students were saying in the corner. It was an insane conversation that would make men go silent and women cry.This lot only ever wrote their names and class designations without an issue. After that, they would begin to chew on their pen caps and stare at the questions, unable to absorb a single word.Very quickly, they discovered that a certain bottom-of-the-year student, who was usually right there complaining with them about the difficulty of the questions, was being very quiet.With one less complainer, they felt like the exam was missing something. The student at the side slept for a while, then woke up and saw He Zhao still answering questions. He asked uncertainly, \u201cZhao-ge, you seem to be in pretty good form today\u2026?\u201dHe Zhao flipped a page on his exam paper and said, \u201cYeah, quite good. Erzhong will be proud to have a student like me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe invigilating teacher had intended to turn a blind eye and not bother with this exam room, but the students were getting rowdier and rowdier. He put down the book in his hand and coughed. \u201cEveryone, quiet down.\u201dThe student swallowed back his words of complaint.Looking at He Zhao, he really couldn\u2019t understand his blind self-confidence.Xie Yu answered each question succinctly and to the point. When he was done, he checked the paper from beginning to end, then turned to look at the clock on the wall. He estimated he could still sleep for half an hour or so.Out of the corner of his eye, he saw that He Zhao was still writing the essay portion and was currently finishing the conclusion.He Zhao usually didn\u2019t answer the question properly and his handwriting would float off the ruled lines. Everything he wrote made people think he was bullshitting. This time, he had reined in all his casualness and his eyes were lowered as he wrote seriously.After the invigilating teacher\u2019s warning, the exam room was quiet for a few minutes before the students who needed to pass answers began passing them again. \u201cGive me the answers and my life will be yours from now on. Bro, I beg of you, do a good deed\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t cut in line. Don\u2019t snatch. In this exam room, we need to copy in order\u2014no, wait, bro, I\u2019ve never seen you before. Are you new?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dXie Yu had not paid close attention to what He Zhao had written for his essay, but when he put his head on his hands and closed his eyes, he heard the neighboring row chatting and he suddenly remembered He Zhao\u2019s essay, Silhouette, from last semester.They\u2019d passed answers in this exam room.They\u2019d racked their brains for how to write a perfect zero-point essay that stayed as far from the essay prompt as possible.They\u2019d also held hands.It was like a wondrous yet absurd dream.Xie Yu fell asleep while thinking. He faintly heard Dean Jiang announce over the intercom, \u201cFifteen minutes left till the end of the exam. Students, watch the time.\u201dThe answers that needed to be passed had all been passed. The 120 minutes they spent in this exam room dragged on. In the poor students\u2019 gathering grounds, everyone gradually quieted down and tossed down their pens, leaving their fates to the heavens as most of them fell asleep.The invigilating teacher shook his head at this incredible sight.The midterms were much more difficult than the questions they usually did in school.After the exams were over, everyone was despondent and exhausted. They had no idea how they would do.\u201cWe\u2019re done for. This time, we\u2019re really done for.\u201d The bell rang after the last exam and papers were collected. Liu Cunhao turned his paper in and walked out of the exam room with one hand braced against the wall. He returned to Class 3 with great difficulty and immediately called out, \u201cBrothers in arms, come and report the war situation.\u201dLuo Wenqiang said, \u201cI was forced into a corner with nowhere to go.\u201dXu Qingqing said, \u201cI couldn\u2019t fight destiny and I couldn\u2019t change my fate.\u201dWan Da said, \u201cI died in battle.\u201dOut of the whole class, only Xie Yu and He Zhao looked unperturbed.He Zhao was moving his desk back to its spot when he heard Liu Cunhao, and he raised a hand too. He leaned against the desk, supporting his weight with one hand, and said, \u201cDid better than usual!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dLiu Cunhao felt his heart, already shot through with a thousand wounds, thoroughly shatter.Xie Yu half-sat on his desk, waiting for Wan Da to move his desk forward. It was blocking the way so he couldn\u2019t move his. He reached out, caught hold of the back of He Zhao\u2019s collar, and dragged him over. \u201cDon\u2019t you remember anything? If you keep talking, Hao-zi might jump off the balcony.\u201dAll the subject teachers were also worried about how their students\u2019 exam grades would be. Ater invigilating the various exam rooms, they expected the average might hit a historic low.Several teachers gathered in the faculty office to discuss grades. \u201cI\u2019m quite worried. Before, we were just two or three points shy of the other schools. This time it might be five or six points.\u201d\u201cEspecially math. The questions this time were very difficult. We usually drill them on the foundations and they don\u2019t usually do questions like these.\u201dHalfway through the conversation, the teachers seemed to remember something and called out, \u201cOld Tang, aren\u2019t you going to Shisizhong this weekend to grade papers?\u201dWhen the four schools set exams together, each school would send several teachers to the other schools to help grade papers.This time, the second-year teachers\u2019 group was sending Tang Sen and Wu Zheng to grade the papers. Old Tang had just packed up his things and was about to go to class. On hearing this, he said, \u201cYes, Mr. Wu and I.\u201dGrading was hard work and a full day of grading strained the eyes. No teacher wanted to grade on the weekends.\u201cIt\u2019s hard on you two.\u201d The other teachers shook their heads, then exclaimed quietly, \u201cI wonder how those two from your class did\u2026\u201d\u2018Those two\u2019 from Class 3 had been mentioned.The faculty office sank into silence, then everyone sighed in unison.Near dismissal time.When Madam Gu called saying she was at the school gates, He Zhao was earning the ire of his classmates with the words \u2018Did better than usual.\u2019 Liu Cunhao and Luo Wenqiang had joined forces to chase him down and beat him up.Seeing that class spirits were low, He Zhao very obligingly let them chase him around to lighten the mood.After being chased for a while, He Zhao changed course mid-run and leaped out of the window, hands braced on the windowsill. His feet caught air. \u201c\u2014Is this how you treat a classmate? With violence?\u201dAfter He Zhao jumped out, he sidled up to Xie Yu. \u201cOld Xie, save me.\u201dLuo Wenqiang stopped and asked Xie Yu\u2019s opinion as he rolled up his sleeves. \u201cYu-ge, can I punch him?\u201dOn the other end of the line, Madam Gu had said a lot but Xie Yu hadn\u2019t paid close attention. He said, \u201cMm,\u201d to appease her.Luo Wenqiang said, \u201cThanks, Yu-ge! Then I\u2019ll go all out!\u201dHe Zhao: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dXie Yu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dOld Tang left the faculty office carrying a thick stack of homework. Seeing them causing a ruckus in the corridor, he heaved a sigh of relief. He was worried that these kids might have been in low spirits due to the exam, but to his surprise they all had strong psychological constitutions. \u201cAll right, everyone go back to class and sit down. Don\u2019t run about like that.\u201dLiu Cunhao stopped in his tracks. \u201cSir, when will grades be out?\u201d\u201cIf nothing unexpected happens, we\u2019ll finish grading the papers over the weekend.\u201dOld Tang thought for a while, then continued, \u201cYou\u2019ll have to wait a few more days for grades to be out.\u201dTang Sen left very early the next morning to catch the train to Shisizhong to grade papers. And he would never have thought that something unexpected would happen, just like that.\u201cTeachers, thank you for your hard work.\u201d A bespectacled female teacher passed the exam papers out to the dozen or so teachers packed into a classroom. They fell silent and the only sound remaining in the classroom was that of turning pages.Shisizhong was the premier school among A City\u2019s public high schools.Their graduation rate was not as good as the top-tier high schools, but it was solid.Shisizhong had prepared several empty classrooms for the teachers to grade papers. Wu Zheng was next to Tang Sen.Wu Zheng graded two papers, then took out his spectacles case and put on his glasses. He looked down and continued filling in points in the score boxes next to the questions.The process of grading was tedious, but sometimes the teachers would come across some wrong answers that left them unsure whether to laugh or cry, and they would discuss it. \u201cThis student draws very creative solid geometry figures. All in all\u2026 let me count. He drew 13 of them?\u201dThe teachers bowed their heads and graded the exams.One among the 14 of them was a very respected math teacher. He had taught for several decades and was one of the question setters for the combined exam. He finished grading a stack, then took another stack from the side.But grading this new stack made him frown deeply.\u201cMr. Wang, what\u2019s the matter?\u201c\u201dWhat is going on with the students in this exam room?\u201dMr. Wang flipped over another sheet. He was even more certain now that in this stack of exam papers, the answers were all copied from each other. Even the mistakes they made were identical. He was left speechless by these shenanigans. \u201cThey\u2019re quite united. In sharing answers and cheating as a team.\u201dThey weren\u2019t just united. Their teamwork was beyond imagination.Mr. Wang had run out of patience and quickly graded more than half the papers.There were two papers remaining. He flipped them over with zero care, wanting only to leave this \u2018united\u2019 exam room as soon as he could. But when he saw the writing on the answer sheet his hand froze.The tip of the red pen stopped in midair.\u2014It was a rather promising answer sheet.[]Translation notes: [1] The grade sheets are ranked by score.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The highest grade anyone had received all morning was 138.This exam had been difficult and anything above 130 was already considered a good score.But the answer sheet before Mr. Wang was beautifully written, fully grasped the concepts being tested, and had impeccable logic. From start to finish, he couldn\u2019t find a single error.A perfect score.Mr. Wang\u2019s eyes grew bright.\u201cWow.\u201d As he finished grading, he put down his pen, seemingly forgetting the one last paper he had not yet graded. He flipped through the perfect-score paper and looked it over several times, exclaiming to himself, \u201cA perfect score. That\u2019s wonderful. I wonder which school they\u2019re from.\u201dThe rare perfect score not only surprised him, it also washed away the exhaustion of grading all morning.The teachers sitting next to Mr. Wang also leaned over to look. \u201cA perfect score?\u201d\u201cLook on the package. The school name is written there\u2026\u201dA teacher flipped the package of answer sheets and looked. He was surprised and raised his voice. \u201c\u2014E-erzhong?\u201dWu Zheng was sitting some distance away from the group of Shisizhong teachers.The more he graded, the more worried he grew about the little brats from his school. He thought, Look, some other school has already produced a perfect score. He sighed and stopped for a break.But the moment he twisted open the cap of a bottle of mineral water, he unexpectedly heard the word \u2018Erzhong.\u2019 \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAh, Mr. Wu, he\u2019s from your school!\u201dWu Zheng screwed the bottle cap back on. \u201cYou read it wrong, right?\u201d\u201cNope. It\u2019s Liyang Erzhong.\u201dWu Zheng was completely stunned. He stood up, nearly tripping over the table leg. \u201cThat\u2019s impossible. Erzhong\u2019s students couldn\u2019t score above 130 if their life depended on it.\u201dMr. Wang had to rest for a while to recover from the joy of finding a perfect-score paper. Then he remembered there was one last paper he hadn\u2019t graded. He turned the perfect-score paper over, then his hand stilled again.This time, not only did he pause, his fingers started trembling slightly.Wu Zheng walked over to Mr. Wang. Before he could pick up the perfect-score paper, his gaze followed Mr. Wang\u2019s shaking hands and disbelieving gaze and caught sight of the answer sheet which had not yet been graded. It was an incredibly brazen answer sheet.Next to the grade sheet, the owner of the answer sheet had already written a striking figure in black pen: 150.The handwriting was carefree and the strokes were energetic.Wu Zheng: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat a farce.\u201d Mr. Wang took two deep breaths, then said, \u201cMr. Wu, the students from your school sure have character. Giving himself a perfect score?\u201dWu Zheng said, \u201cNo\u2026\u201d He wanted to say, surely this moron isn\u2019t a student from our school?How could our school turn out a student like this?And he had no recollection of this handwriting, either.Before Wu Zheng could continue, Mr. Wang cut him off. \u201cFine. I want to see if he actually gets a perfect score.\u201dThis anonymous student had not only pre-given himself a perfect grade, he had filled up the whole exam paper, as if he was showing off his skills. For every long-answer question he had written down three or four ways of solving it.Sometimes, on the side of the question was written a note, as if the test taker had too much free time. This question won\u2019t do. What was the question setter thinking?Mr. Wang, who was the question setter for the combined exam: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dXie Yu still had no idea what a ruckus his and He Zhao\u2019s math papers had caused for the exam graders. He also did not know that the teachers had nearly had to call an ambulance right there in Shisizhong\u2019s grading area.In the morning, Xie Yu paid a visit to Black Water Street.When he got off the bus, he remembered that Aunt Mei had mentioned in the group chat that she had a cough, so he visited a pharmacy on the way to pick up some medicine for her.Class 3 was still calculating scores in their group chat. Since the previous night, the chat had not stopped vibrating with updates.[Wan Da]: I\u2019m finished. No matter how I look at it, I\u2019m only getting a 90+ for math.[Liu Cunhao]: @LuoWenQiang, Qiang-ge, what are you posting on your dash? It\u2019s flooding my screen.[Luo Wenqiang]: I heard that if I reblog it a miracle will happen.While the pharmacist was ringing up the bill, Xie Yu tapped into Luo Wenqiang\u2019s profile and glanced at it.Luo Wenqiang had reblogged a lot of strange things. \u2018Reblog this stone.\u2019 \u2018Reblog this magic restaurant napkin.\u2019 \u2018Reblog this lucky talisman.\u2019\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d[Liu Cunhao]: Does this stuff really work?[Luo Wenqiang]: Cure a dead horse as if it\u2019s alive,\u00b9 right? Look at the comments. Someone said he \u2018struck it rich and is coming back to return the favor.\u2019 Looks pretty legit.[Wan Da]: I reblogged.[Xu Qingqing]: I reblogged.Xie Yu paid and walked to Guang Mao with complicated feelings. He thought to himself, Class 3 really is trying.Xu Yanmei was currently in a conference room holding a meeting. Although she ran a clothing wholesale market, she ran meetings like a mob boss.Cigarette smoke circled through the room.\u201cWhat on earth! Sell, my goddamn ass. Did I not make it clear enough or is there something wrong with his brain?\u201dXu Yanmei stubbed out her cigarette then pulled another one from the box. Holding it between her teeth with the ease of practice, she lit it one-handed, then slammed the lighter onto the table with a crash. \u201cWho\u2019s up to settle this score with me!\u201dShe was yelling so loudly that she did not notice the extra person standing in the conference room doorway.\u201cWhat are we settling?\u201dXie Yu, several boxes of medicine in hand, watched her from the conference room doorway. He didn\u2019t look too happy. \u201cYou\u2019re smoking pretty happily there.\u201dEveryone knew that the Big Sis of Guang Mao was scared of neither heaven nor earth, but the one thing she feared was her godson. Everyone else had the self-awareness to walk out. \u201cWe\u2019re going, Mei-jie. We\u2019ll go settle the score with you. If there\u2019s anything, just call and we\u2019ll be there.\u201dXu Yanmei had nowhere to hide the cigarette. \u201cAbout this, I can explain\u2026\u201dXie Yu frowned. He had no patience to listen. \u201cHand over the cigarette.\u201dXu Yanmei shut up.Xie Yu stubbed the cigarette right out.They hadn\u2019t seen each other for a while. The kid seemed to have grown again.Xu Yanmei was now a head shorter, and Xie Yu had claimed the moral high ground the moment he arrived. She paused for a while, then remembered the matter of grades. \u201cWait a minute, brat. I haven\u2019t settled the score with you. If Lei-zi hadn\u2019t told me\u2014\u201dXu Yanmei grabbed the plastic clothes rack at her side and brought it down, and Xie Yu endured several hits.Xie Yu said, \u201cOf course you\u2019ve settled it. How many times have you settled this with me?\u201dOver winter vacation, Xu Yanmei had exploded in the Weixin group chat. Then she had called and sent him videos. If he had not stopped her, she might have gotten a cab and come over from B City overnight.\u201cYou\u2019re still talking back?\u201d\u201cFine, it\u2019s my fault.\u201d Xie Yu pushed open a window for air and put the medicine he held on the table. Then he said, \u201cI\u2019ll score first place in the mid-term exams for you.\u201dThe top places on the grade sheet for each year were always the same people. Everyone else wished that grades would never be released, only this group wanted them to be released quickly so they could see who had scored first place this time.But this time, the people waiting for grades to be released quickly consisted not only of these good students, but also the dozens of people in Class 3.Monday.All of Class 3 arrived early. After entering the classroom, they didn\u2019t even wait to put down their schoolbags before getting together and discussing grades.Occasionally, someone from Class 4 next door walked by.The two groups stared silently at each other for a while. Class 3 had no confidence, but they wouldn\u2019t lose in attitude. They quietly straightened their backs.\u201cDo you think grades will be out by today?\u201d\u201cProbably. All the papers were graded over the weekend, right? Everything else about Erzhong aside, our school is top-notch at grading things quickly. During the last monthly exam, I hadn\u2019t even prepared how I was going to meet my death and the grades were already out.\u201d\u201cOld Tang said before it might be a few more days.\u201d\u201cWan Da, how about you go to the faculty office and suss out the situation?\u201dWan Da, bearing a heavy responsibility on his shoulders, crouched at the door of the faculty office for several minutes.The atmosphere in the faculty office felt slightly amiss, but he couldn\u2019t put his finger on what it was. Perhaps it was too quiet. But he still hadn\u2019t found out anything and was wondering if he should keep listening when Old Tang pulled the door open and walked out.Wan Da swiftly sneaked toward the toilet.Old Tang said in a low voice, \u201c\u2026Stop hiding. Come here for a minute.\u201dIt was rush hour and people thronged through the school gates. The whole street was jam-packed with parents\u2019 cars so tightly even water couldn\u2019t flow through.Xie Yu leaned against the bus window, the cord of his earphones snaking out from his uniform pocket. The English listening comprehension test he was listening to was just wrapping up and entering the answer phase. But it was drowned out by the sound of cars honking from the intersection up ahead.He glanced down to adjust the volume and saw several texts He Zhao had sent.Little friend.Are you on the way?I\u2019m waiting for you at the bus station.He Zhao sent the text and waited for a while, then someone unexpectedly tapped him on the shoulder from behind.Xie Yu had one hand stuck in his pockets and hadn\u2019t removed his earphones. People milled about and the street was a sea of school uniforms. Xie Yu was wearing the same thing as everyone else, but he was still eye-catching. \u201cLet\u2019s go. What are you just standing there for?\u201dHe Zhao had not seen the bus come this way. He asked, \u201cYou walked over here?\u201dXie Yu said, \u201cThe front way was too jammed.\u201d\u201cWas it jammed or did you want to see me?\u201d\u201cPlease, be less shameless.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to give my boyfriend one last chance.\u201d\u201cIt was jammed.\u201dXie Yu was walking in front, but now he slowed his footsteps and replied again, \u201cI came to see you, all right, ge?\u201dThey walked to the base of the classroom building and had just rounded the corner into the stairwell when they bumped into Wan Da.It was early in the morning but he was already up to something. He was squatting in the stairwell entryway and he gave He Zhao a fright. \u201cFuck, what are you doing?\u201dWan Da had squatted in the stairwell entryway for nearly ten minutes precisely so he would be able to catch them.\u201cOld Tang told me to wait here for you.\u201dWan Da had squatted for so long his legs were numb. He pulled himself up using the railing, then said, \u201cHe told me to tell you to go to the office immediately. Did you two do something?\u201dThey hadn\u2019t done anything, per se.At most, they had given the subject teachers each reasons to take a few Quick-Acting Heart Reliever pills.Wu Zheng was standing by the water cooler. He got his water, but still felt like he couldn\u2019t catch his breath. \u201cMr. Tang, do you still have any? Give me two more\u2026\u201dIn front of Tang Sen were placed Quick-Acting Heart Reliever pills and several exam papers. These exam papers all hadperfect scores, or near-perfect scores.He flipped open each exam paper again and took a second look. At the upper right corner, where the name box was.Student\u2019s name: Xie Yu.Student\u2019s name: He Zhao.When the papers were done being graded, he and Wu Zheng stayed in the Shisizhong classroom and sat face to face in silence for more than half an hour.In all the years since Erzhong had been founded\u2014the school had never seen such grades.Not only did they easily beat out the rest of the four schools, this was a rare sight even in the top-tier school Tang Sen had taught at before.Xie Yu and He Zhao left and didn\u2019t return for a long time.Wan Da was so unbearably curious he couldn\u2019t sit still. \u201cDoes this count as skipping class in broad daylight? Where on earth did they go? What are they doing?\u201dLiu Cunhao, whom Wan Da had nagged at all morning, was getting a headache. \u201cInstead of sitting here, why don\u2019t you go and do your professional duty during lunch?Wan Da said, \u201cHao-zi, that\u2019s a good idea.\u201dThe whereabouts of the two big bros were still a mystery, but Wan Da unearthed an unexpected piece of news.Wan Da had many friends and knew people in every class. When he went to Class 7, someone was carrying a stack of homework on the way back from the faculty office. He tapped Wan Da\u2019s shoulder and said, \u201cDo you know what your class average is?\u201dWan Da looked back, hands still on the windowsill. \u201cAh? Our class average?\u201d\u201cYeah. Fucking impressive. I wondered if my eyes had gone bad.\u201dThe guy hadn\u2019t seen the details, but he had glanced at the class averages on the teacher\u2019s screen. He was still in shock now. \u201cHigher than the year average by 4-point-something points.\u201dWan Da said, \u201c\u2026Your eyes are bad, surely.\u201dAfter thrice-verifying that this piece of information was accurate, Wan Da walked on cloud nine all the way back to class. In his mind, all that remained was the thought, I must have done very well this time around!No! Our Class 3 surely all did very well this time around!We\u2019ve changed our fate!\u201cHis eyes are bad.\u201dWhen Wan Da returned to the classroom, his terrible grades for every subject were there to welcome him. The subject reps had distributed the exam papers. Liu Cunhao\u2019s face was pale as he slammed down the papers Wan Da had failed. \u201cHis eyes are definitely bad. Look for yourself. Four-point-something, with scores like this? You\u2019re dreaming.\u201dWan Da refused to give up. Staring at his awful grades, he sank into thought. \u201c\u2026What about everyone else in class?\u201dLiu Cunhao waved his own papers. \u201cAbout the same.\u201dLuo Wenqiang said, \u201cMy ability is average and my performance is the same.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201d Xu Qingqing passed the English papers out and heard them discussing the class average. After hesitating, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s true. 4.6. I saw it, too.\u201dRight up until the class bell rang, Class 3 couldn\u2019t make heads or tails of where the 4.6 had come fromNo one discovered that two exam papers had been held back and not distributed.Luo Wenqiang\u2019s horizons had been broadened and he decided he was now a believer in mysticism.\u00b2 \u201cDid my good luck reblogs really work miracles?\u201d\u201cThink more rationally, will you?\u201d As Liu Cunhao spoke, he immediately began a new train of thought. \u201cCan we think about how badly the other classes did this time?\u201dThe two people whose whereabouts Wan Da was unbearably curious about were currently re-taking the exam in an empty classroom.Xie Yu wasn\u2019t surprised by this turn of events at all. Anyone would find it hard to accept that the two students with the lowest grades in the year suddenly scored highest in the year, and that their total score across all subjects was far ahead of all the exam-taking students in the four schools, forming an uncrossable gap.When they were told to retake the test, Xie Yu didn\u2019t outwardly react much. He said, \u201cSir, there\u2019s one issue.\u201dOld Tang was considerate of them and feared that their young souls had been hurt. He hurriedly explained, \u201cIt\u2019s not that we don\u2019t trust you. This is because\u2026\u201d\u201cThe exam duration is too long.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201dXie Yu said, \u201cI don\u2019t need that much time. Half an hour is enough.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe Zhao had no objections to retaking the test, but he had one concern. \u201cWhy did I only score 148 on the math paper?\u201dWu Zheng quietly grasped the bottle of Quick-Acting Heart Reliever pills tighter.\u201cThe two points deducted were for handwriting.\u201dWu Zheng steadied himself, then said, \u201c\u2026Brat, you criticized the question-setter on the paper itself for not setting good enough questions and you thought you\u2019d score a 150?\u201d[]Translation notes: [1] Cure a dead horse as if it\u2019s alive: Make a last-ditch attempt [2] Xuanxue: A philosophy from the Wei-Jin era with roots in Taoism and Confucianism.

    "Chapter 10": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fake Slackers101 \u2013 Old Xie, run.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayFake SlackersTranslator: JuryEditor: NomNomFirst Published on Chaleuria\u2014101 \u2013 Old Xie, run.Class was about to start and the noise in the corridor gradually quieted.Wu Zheng sat by the podium, eyes fixed unblinkingly on the two special \u2018exam takers.\u2019There were only three people total in the classroom so it looked empty. One of them finished answering the questions, tossed his pen, then lay down on the table to sleep. From where Wu Zheng sat, he could only see the back of his head.Another one of them had too much free time and nothing to do, and was doodling on scratch paper with pen in hand.Before Xie Yu lay down, only one thought remained in his head: half an hour is still a little too long.He had not napped for very long before he faintly felt an intense gaze on him. It made him feel uneasy, so he opened his eyes again and met his boyfriend\u2019s unconcealed, assessing gaze. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat are you two doing? If you\u2019re done with the exam, turn it in.\u201dWu Zheng glanced at his wristwatch. Generously speaking, the two of them had been taking this math paper for about twenty minutes. He knew they were close deskmates but they were even making eyes at each other in front of him.Wu Zheng really didn\u2019t know what to say to them. Over the last two days he had taken many emotional blows and now he really couldn\u2019t take it any more. \u201cTurn it in, turn it in. Turn it in and then hurry back to class.\u201dFrom start to finish, the word \u2018cheating\u2019 had not crossed Wu Zheng\u2019s mind. Instead, Wu Zheng was thinking more along the lines of \u2018did these two go out together for a walk over winter vacation and get struck by lightning\u2026 so hard it broke their brains.\u2019Not even cheating could explain these grades.The elaborate way He Zhao had answered the questions\u2014which cheating student would make so much trouble for themselves? And where would they find answer keys like that?\u201cHold on.\u201dXie Yu had just taken two steps when he heard Wu Zheng calling them again.Wu Zheng cleared his throat and asked, \u201cDid you two go out over winter vacation for any events?\u201dHe Zhao had no idea what he meant by this and answered, \u201cYes. We went to karaoke?\u201dWu Zheng really wanted to ask how the weather had been that day, if there had been a thunderstorm, and, most importantly, if lightning had struck both of them. He steadied himself, then swallowed all his nonsensical questions one by one and waved a hand dismissively. \u201cThat\u2019s all. Hurry up and go.\u201dLiterature, math, English, and combined science. They took exams all morning.They had been told it was a new exam, but each paper was just ten major questions. None of them were ordinary questions, however. The difficulty was comparable to those of the top tier schools.When Xie Yu turned in his paper, the questions from each subject test were still rattling around in his mind.He was still thinking about them when someone abruptly shoved a piece of paper into his hand. \u201cWhat is this?\u201dOutside the classroom, the midday sun shone hotly on them. He Zhao unzipped his jacket and said, \u201cA master is giving this gift to you. A masterpiece.\u201dXie Yu straightened the sheet of scratch paper in his hand. Aside from a messy set of calculations, there was also an abstract-style line drawing.The lines were messy, and it was only faintly recognizable as a human figure. If not for Xie Yu remembering that this guy had been staring at him the entire time they were retaking the exams, he would have no way of telling who the subject of the drawing was.\u2026\u2026Masterpiece, my ass.He Zhao was quite confident in his drawing skills. \u201cSurprised?\u201d\u201cSurprised, yes.\u201d Xie Yu slowly folded the scratch paper up again, then beckoned to him. \u201cCome over.\u201dHe Zhao leaned over and was about to say, \u201cI don\u2019t expect a lot, just kiss me on the cheek,\u201d when he took several direct hits and was nearly kicked down the stairs.Wu Zheng heard the commotion in the corridor, shook his head, and looked back down at the exam papers in front of him.In the combined exams of the four schools, Erzhong had produced two top scores.After these grades had been verified to be right, the explosive news quickly spread throughout the year. Then, it spread not only in year 2, but through the whole school.These grades were so high it was ridiculous. All the subjects featured perfect or near-perfect scores, and there was a 3-digit point difference from the 3rd in the year.Class 3 was not self-aware at all and was still consumed with the notion that \u2018the other classes must have done very badly.\u2019The first afternoon class period was Old Tang\u2019s.The grades had been calculated. Old Tang, knowing they were anxious to find out their grades, brought the grade sheet along with the class material. He planned to analyze their grades with them so that they could lay out rules and study goals for the second half of the term.\u201cOur class average is higher than the year average by 4.6 points\u2026\u201dXie Yu chased He Zhao all the way to the class doorway, where they heard Class 3 cheer so loudly they might have torn off the school roof. \u201cHave they gone mad?\u201dXie Yu covered his ears and gave a noncommittal response.Wan Da was the first to jump up and yell, \u201cIt\u2019s real!\u201dLiu Cunhao\u2019s eyes were growing red. He was a grown man but he only needed to blink to shed a tear. \u201cWe actually really did it!\u201dLuo Wenqiang said, \u201cThis is a miracle! We worked a miracle!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dOld Tang didn\u2019t quite understand why they were so moved. \u201cWait, I haven\u2019t\u2026\u201dBut Liu Cunhao and the others couldn\u2019t wait at all. They had only half-believed this class average before, but now that Old Tang had personally confirmed it, an unbelievable wild joy enveloped them all.\u2014Their class had really succeeded in changing their own fate! By their own strength, even dragging the two bottom-of-the-year students behind them, they had dragged their class average up!They were unbelievably impassioned.Until Xie Yu crooked a finger, face blank, and knocked twice on the door. \u201cReporting in.\u201d\u201cYou two are just in time. Come over and stand by the side.\u201dOld Tang flipped a page of the grade sheet and kept wondering how to make this announcement.All of Class 3 looked at the two bottom-of-the-year students standing side by side next to the podium. Xie Yu looked like he had not gotten enough sleep. He leaned against the wall, hands stuck in his pockets.\u201cThis is what happened. This time around, the first place and second place in the year both came from our class. Classmate Xie Yu scored 150 in math, 146 in literature, 148 in English, 300 in combined science, and came first with a total score of 744\u2026\u201d\u201cHe Zhao scored one point less in total, but\u2026\u201dBefore Old Tang finished, there was a crash from the classroom floor.Liu Cunhao had fallen off his chair, taking the chair with him. As he was falling, he had tried to catch the edge of his desk to steady himself, but had missed and fallen flat on the floor. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWan Da, his deskmate, didn\u2019t hold out a hand to him. \u201cDoes it hurt? It probably doesn\u2019t. This is a dream, so it wouldn\u2019t hurt.\u201dNot only had all of Class 3\u2014who had just a moment ago been yelling \u2018We\u2019re awesome, we worked a miracle\u2019\u2014sunk into a stunned stupor, Class 4 next door wasn\u2019t much better off either.Liang Hui\u2019s face went green, then white.During gym class that morning, he had already bought drinks and distributed them to the class to celebrate, saying they would definitely soundly beat Class 3.Every word he had said then was now like a slap to his face, over and over.Impossible.\u201cDid they cheat? Those two from that class\u2026 is it really true?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t make blind accusations. They retook the exam.\u201d Class 4\u2019s homeroom teacher was also surprised, but despite the surprise, some accusations should not be thrown around. \u201cThe exam setters came up with new questions overnight, even more difficult than the ones on the midterm.\u201dThe whole class was silent.Then someone said quietly, \u201cTheir grades\u2026 they got perfect scores on nearly every subject.\u201dLiang Hui was silent and he nearly snapped the pen in his hand in half.Tang Sen finished announcing grades no one said another word for the rest of the class period.Xie Yu took his exam papers, then returned to his seat and continued sleeping.Liu Cunhao\u2019s butt was still hurting.The pain made him aware that he was not dreaming. This was goddamn reality\u2026 this was real.While Tang Sen was turned to the blackboard writing class notes, Liu Cunhao turned around and looked at the back row, his mind still buzzing with static.\u2014Hao-zi, you ignore me now. But in the future, I\u2019ll climb so high you can\u2019t reach me.\u2014Old Xie and I have no issues getting a perfect score.\u2014I can do this question, I really can. Bring it over here and I\u2019ll do it for you to see.\u2026\u2026Liu Cunhao\u2019s head drooped lower and lower until he buried his face in his hands and internally cursed, \u201cFuck.\u201dXie Yu wasn\u2019t aware his classmates were internally going through so much. He and He Zhao had already warned this lot and they didn\u2019t believe it, choosing to be submersed in their notions of changing their fate.\u201cHow are we going to explain later?\u201d He Zhao poked him with a pen. Liu Cunhao had been staring at him for a long time and he shot back a smile, then kept asking quietly, \u201cLook at Hao-zi. He\u2019s looking at me like he wants to kill me.\u201dXie Yu didn\u2019t open his eyes and retorted, \u201cWhat can we say? That you were always this excellent?\u201dHe Zhao was left with nothing to say.That morning, in the faculty office, Old Tang had asked them about it, but they hadn\u2019t known what to say. They hemmed and hawed for a long time and Old Tang thought they had difficulties they couldn\u2019t talk about, so he didn\u2019t press them, and said, \u201cIt\u2019s fine if this isn\u2019t a good time. When you want to talk about it, come and find me\u2026 but I have to tell your parents about these grades, no matter what the situation is.\u201dBut when Tang Sen called them, Madam Gu was reserved and kept apologizing. \u201cSorry, sir. He\u2019s given you trouble.\u201dHe Zhao\u2019s dad had said without preamble, \u201cI know. My son\u2019s always been excellent.\u201dOld Tang choked. \u201cAh\u2026 all right, He Zhao\u2019s dad. As long as you\u2019re aware of the situation.\u201dThe dismissal bell rang just as Old Tang finished delivering the new content he had prepared.He also assigned them a few sets of homework. Then he realized the students were still frozen in their chairs. \u201cNext class is gym, but you\u2019re still sitting there? This isn\u2019t like you. You like my class so much?\u201dWhen Old Tang packed his things and left the classroom, Liu Cunhao, as the class rep, slowly stood up. \u201cExplain this?\u201dAs Liu Cunhao finished, the rest of Class 3 looked in unison to the back row.For the first time, Xie Yu felt a stifling atmosphere emanating from his classmates.A set of complicated feelings formed a complex mess. These were rooted in surprise, the feeling that they had been lied to, and the realization that the tall tales these two had told and they had refused to believe had turned out to be true in the end.Class 3 might have associated with Xie Yu for too long because they really wanted to use violence to vent their feelings and solve the problem.He Zhao quietly moved backwards, taking his chair with him right to the doorway. He opened his mouth and bullshitted in an attempt to ease the atmosphere. \u201cActually, over winter vacation, Old Xie and I were in a car accident. The night was dark and the wind was high, and as we walked on the street, an electric motorbike\u00b9 came in our direction\u2026\u201dWhen Xie Yu heard the words \u2018electric motorbike,\u2019 he nearly snapped. \u201cAre you sick? Couldn\u2019t you come up with something more normal?\u201dHe Zhao said, \u201cLet me think about it a bit more.\u201dBefore He Zhao could think of anything, Liu Cunhao took the lead, rolling up his sleeves as he leaped over two rows of desks and walked toward the back row. \u201cBrothers, let\u2019s beat them up and then we can talk.\u201dXue Xisheng went even farther than Liu Cunhao. As he passed by the classroom closet he picked up a broom on the way.\u201cOld Xie.\u201d He Zhao stood up and pulled Xie Yu up from his seat. \u201cRun.\u201d[]Translation notes: [1] Electric motorbike: ThisPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Next class period was gym, anyway, so after leaving the classroom building they ran straight for the courtyard.\u201cFuck?\u201dXue Xisheng couldn\u2019t outrun them and after taking two steps he threw the broom. It landed next to He Zhao\u2019s foot.\u201cHow aggressive.\u201d He Zhao nearly tripped. \u201cIs he really the study rep I know?\u201dIt was an impressive sight, majestic and prominent, so shocking that even the people who had been making a scene in the corridor now had the self-awareness to return to their respective classes.The two infamous school tyrants were hounded by their classmates from the fourth floor all the way to the ground floor. By the looks of it, they were going to switch venues to the courtyard and continue the beating. It was pretty much a live brawl.The other classes simply didn\u2019t dare to make a sound. Only when the main army had gone downstairs did they all lean over the railings to peer down at the ground floor. They exclaimed in unison, \u201cHow exciting. They\u2019re so formidable.\u201d\u201cStay right there! Don\u2019t run!\u201d\u201cBrothers, go around and cut them off at the track!\u201d\u201cQing-ge, you take the girls and ambush them from the left!\u201dAfter these strange battle formations were decided, Xue Xisheng yelled across the field, anger rising sharply, \u201cYou purposely dragged the class average down\u2014you\u2019re too much! You have no team pride at all!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThis was the first time in Xie Yu\u2019s life being chased multiple rounds around the quad. No matter where he ran, people surrounded him and he felt both perplexed and pathetic.As he ran, he nudged the person beside him with his forearm. \u201cDo we keep running?\u201dOver the course of several rounds, Class 3 changed their battle tactics several times. Like zombies in the game Dead Rising, they threw themselves at the two from all directions.He Zhao was scared of this lot, too. He took a breath and stopped. \u201cLet\u2019s stop running then. We could run all class period and not get away.\u201dSoon after they stopped, Liu Cunhao pounced on Xie Yu from behind. Xie Yu was thrown off balance by the tackle and fell forward onto He Zhao.He Zhao didn\u2019t have time to do anything other than catch hold of Xie Yu\u2019s waist.The next moment, he lost his balance too.\u201cBrothers,\u201d Liu Cunhao yelled, having caught hold of Xie Yu, \u201cWe got them\u2014\u201dLuo Wenqiang swiftly ran over from the other side of the track. As he ran, he majestically took off his jacket and tossed it into the grass, then leaped to firmly land sprawled on Liu Cunhao. \u201cIf you don\u2019t explain yourselves, neither of you better even think of running away.\u201dOne by one, the guys piled firmly on top of them like stacking Luohan\u00b9 and kept them firmly pressed to the track.It was very noisy by Xie Yu\u2019s ear.Xie Yu looked down and saw only his boyfriend\u2019s Adam\u2019s apple. He glanced further down and saw He Zhao\u2019s open uniform collar.He Zhao was about to say, \u2018That\u2019s enough, don\u2019t pile on any more,\u2019 but before he could get the words out he met Xie Yu\u2019s eyes.They were too close.Both caught unaware, they stared at each other for several seconds, stunned.Liu Cunhao had only intended to pin down the class\u2019s two big bros. When Luo Wenqiang, the heavyweight, pounced, he too was squashed till he couldn\u2019t breathe. \u201cGym rep, how much do you weigh? Couldn\u2019t it have been someone else?\u201dLuo Wenqiang was aggrieved. \u201cHao-zi, you don\u2019t want me?\u201dXie Yu and He Zhao looked at each other for a moment. Who knew which of them started laughing first, but the laughter was contagious, passing between them through the vibration of their chests.Xie Yu, still laughing, averted his eyes, and propped himself up on his arms on the rubber track surface. Without looking back, he said to the people on top of his back, \u201cAre you sick? Get off.\u201dSeveral bright whistle sounds cut short the \u2018Stacking Luohan\u2019 activity.The gym teacher walked out of the office holding a stopwatch. \u201cThat pile over there\u2014yes, that\u2019s you all\u2014get in a line. Don\u2019t all crowd.\u201dHearing this, Luo Wenqiang and the others hurriedly stood up.Xie Yu felt the weight on his body lift and was about to get off He Zhao, but before he could lever himself up He Zhao called him. \u201cXie Yu.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201dHe Zhao said nothing.He Zhao lifted his upper body. With this movement, his uniform jacket slid downward slightly, making his clothing look mussed. His lips lightly grazed the side of Xie Yu\u2019s face before landing lightly at the base of Xie Yu\u2019s ear.It was soundless, but it tickled.By now several classes had arrived at the courtyard and there were also a few groups who hadn\u2019t left from the last class period.He Zhao leaned backward. While no one was looking, he pulled further apart and smiled as he said, \u201cKiss me.\u201dOnce everyone had fallen in line, the gym teacher waved the stopwatch in his hand and said, \u201cWe\u2019ll try out long distance today. I was watching you from the window and saw you already did a few laps to warm up. Not bad. You\u2019re very enthusiastic. So let\u2019s start now. Boys, follow me first.\u201d1000m.Everyone complained.They had already expended a lot of energy in the ten minutes between classes so when the gym teacher yelled, \u201cReady\u2014run!\u201d everybody flat out couldn\u2019t muster the energy. They slowly jogged forward and the runtime they scored was right at the passing mark.After running 2 and a half laps, everyone else collapsed on the floor aside from the two big bros who had superhuman stamina.The gym teacher finished recording the times, then let them remain in their state of group paralysis and went over to the girls\u2019 group to time the 800m. \u201cGirls, prepare.\u201dXie Yu bent at the waist, hands on his knees, and breathed deeply.He Zhao sat to the side of the track and someone jostled him from behind.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you two?\u201d Wan Da retracted his hand, but two seconds after sitting up he nearly lost his balance and lay back down. He asked the key question. \u201c\u2026I really want to know your secret to getting better grades.\u201dHe Zhao motioned for him to come over.With his last shred of strength, Wan Da nudged himself a few centimeters closer to He Zhao\u2019s side.\u201cExtra-strength brain-enhancing pills. Improves memory. No matter how complicated the formulas and concepts, you need only read them once and you won\u2019t forget them.\u201d He Zhao\u2019s voice dropped lower and lower as he spoke, and it really sounded true. \u201cLook for TB shop xxx. It has good reviews and a return policy and you can even redeem 1 yuan cash back.\u201dWan Da quietly made a note of the Taobao shop name. \u201cIs that true, Zhao-ge?\u201dHe Zhao said, \u201cYou believed that?\u201dWan Da: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dXie Yu was the closest and he thought to himself that He Zhao\u2019s skill at bullshitting with his eyes closed had improved by leaps and bounds again.After running another two laps, Liu Cunhao and the others were tired, but they were also now unexpectedly clearheaded.This issue was difficult to ask about. And regardless of what their real reasons were, Class 3 shouldn\u2019t use them as idle entertainment. Besides, having made a scene just now, Class 3 had more or less vented their feelings.Liu Cunhao slapped the back of Wan Da\u2019s head and tried to change the subject. \u201cDo you think Class 4 should kneel down and call us father?\u201d\u201cI nearly forgot.\u201d Luo Wenqiang tilted his head back and drank water, then said, \u201cWhen class lets out later, I\u2019m going to stand outside Class 4 and walk around. Give them a hint. Anyone want to go with me?\u201dGo, my foot. Xie Yu didn\u2019t quite want to imagine what \u2018standing around outside Class 4\u2019 would look like.This was idiotic.Xie Yu said, \u201cDon\u2019t look at me. I\u2019m not going.\u201dXie Yu and He Zhao had been Class 3\u2019s pillars in terms of good looks before, and now they were the class\u2019s pillars of grades. Even though they didn\u2019t want to go, Class 3 dragged them to Class 4\u2019s entrance and walked around a few times.\u201cThink about how you treated us,\u201d Luo Wenqiang said as he walked. \u201cYou have the cheek not to go?\u201d\u201cOf course we do.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dLiang Hui had been trying to digest this matter since noon and still couldn\u2019t. He couldn\u2019t concentrate at all in class and all he could think of was the heaven-defying \u2018744.\u2019The next class period, he turned and saw Class 3 all standing in a line in the corridor, looking in through the window at Class 4.Everyone in this line wore a colorful expression except for Xie Yu, whose face was blank.All of them looked down at Class 4 with impossible pride and arrogance.Especially Class 3\u2019s class rep. He could have been looking at Liang Hui with his nostrils.Since noon, when grades were released, till school let out in the evening, the school forum\u2019s hottest and most popular thread was no longer a certain two big bros\u2019 CP thread, but the two heaven-defying grade sheets.All kinds of rumors emerged and discussion ran wild.Evening self-study ended.Xie Yu showered, pulled open the private bathroom door and came out. He heard his phone ring on his desk and went to look at his notifications while still towelling his hair.In the notification list was a link from Wan Da leading to a forum thread. Several words in large font made up the headline: Shocking! The two top students may have been in an accident that injured their brains!\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d[Wan Da]: This is your and Zhao-ge\u2019s image now.[Wan Da]: They even want you two to go to the hospital to have your brains checked\u2026Xie Yu glanced at it. The more he read, the more ridiculous it got. There were posts about high-tech brain transfer technologies, genetic mutation, and even topic drifts such as \u2018transmigration\u2019 and \u2018rebirth.\u2019When He Zhao knocked on the door and entered carrying a mock paper, Xie Yu had just closed out of that very imagination-rich thread.His little friend was wearing only a thin, loose-fitting vest and his hair was still dripping wet.He had rubbed it nearly dry and now he pulled off the towel, then ran his fingers lightly through his hair combing it backwards. As he brought the wisps of hair covering his forehead backwards, his features seemed even more defined, cold and clean-cut.He Zhao had brought practice questions with him but he completely forgot about them after seeing Xie Yu. \u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d\u201cIdiotic forum posts.\u201d\u201cThe one Wan Da made?\u201d He Zhao shut the door and continued, \u201cThe novel someone wrote in there is quite good. Did you see it? It was called\u2026 Reborn as an Erzhong Top Student.\u201dXie Yu said, \u201cI read some of it.\u201dHe Zhao put the mock paper on the desk, then sat on the side of the bed watching Xie Yu bent over picking up his clothes.Xie Yu stuffed his discarded clothes into the laundry hamper, thought about something, then went to pick up the jacket at the foot of the bed. As he touched the piece of clothing, He Zhao caught hold of his hand.\u201cLeave the tidying,\u201d He Zhao said. \u201cCome and deal with me instead?\u201d[]Translation notes: [1] Stacking Luohan: Human pyramid formation, usually seen in gymnastics or performances.

Didn\u2019t you want me to deal with you?\u201cYou need dealing with?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019ll depend on how you want to deal with me. For instance, if it\u2019s fighting on the bed\u2026\u201dXie Yu didn\u2019t retract his hand, leaving it trapped under He Zhao\u2019s.Then he lowered his eyes and leaned down without a second word. Different from the furtive kiss earlier that day on the courtyard under everyone\u2019s eyes, this kiss was harsh without any attempt to hide it.All remaining words were extinguished between their interlocking lips and teeth.Xie Yu opened his mouth a little, revealing a row of small teeth. As if in revenge, he bit the corner of He Zhao\u2019s mouth.He Zhao had been teased to the point of losing his rationality. He moved his hands upward along the waist of the person in his arms, his hand half-hidden by the hem of Xie Yu\u2019s vest. At the bite, he couldn\u2019t hold back a hiss.Outside, in the corridor, people were walking to and fro.Someone seemed to have lost something. There was a commotion.\u201cIs it over there?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t see it. Look over there again. Quick, before the lights go out.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe footsteps continued intermittently.Separated from it by the door, Xie Yu couldn\u2019t help his breathing growing shallower, all the nerves in his body dialed up to their highest sensitivity. He Zhao held onto his waist and moved upward and Xie Yu felt his temperature rise where the hands touched.\u201cYou\u2019re hard.\u201dXie Yu half-opened his eyes. Seeing that he had bitten a suggestive mark on the corner of He Zhao\u2019s mouth, he said hoarsely, \u201cYou\u2019re not much better off.\u201dLast time hadn\u2019t gone so well.It had been both of their first times. He Zhao hadn\u2019t known how to treat his partner and he hadn\u2019t been completely relaxed, either.But they were both at the age where their blood ran hot. Often they couldn\u2019t control themselves and as they messed around, sparks turned into fire.He Zhao was still worried. He had filled in the gaps in his knowledge by looking online, but putting it into practice was another matter. \u201cDid it really hurt?\u201dEver since he was young, Xie Yu did not let out a frown even when he got injured. He had a high pain tolerance and previously when he had said it hurt, it was mostly because he hadn\u2019t slept well all night and was more frustrated than anything. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t so bad.\u201d\u201cActually, I hurt too.\u201dHe Zhao coughed awkwardly and said, \u201cYou were too tight.\u201dBy the time He Zhao had finished speaking, Xie Yu had taken off his shirt. His hand rested at He Zhao\u2019s waist and he reached for his waistband.Xie Yu\u2019s upper body was bare and beneath his narrow, exquisite collarbones the V-line of his pelvis disappearing into his waistband. As Xie Yu moved, the red string on his wrist slid downward a little, the red bean coming to rest on the jut of his wristbone.It was nearly summer, but the nights had still been on the cooler side.Xie Yu had intended to undo He Zhao\u2019s waistband, but now his hands wandered inappropriately through the material, touching a certain place. He raised his eyes and said, \u201cGet over here. Didn\u2019t you want me to deal with you?\u201dHe Zhao supported himself against the side of the bed and felt his throat grow tight.Xie Yu caught him off guard by taking initiative and all his self-control crumbled away.\u2026One day he would die at this person\u2019s hands.Lights out.The whole building went dark and the only remaining light came from the streetlamps outside.Xie Yu was held down under He Zhao, one arm braced on the edge of the bed. Unwilling to show weakness, he levered himself half up to kiss him.\u201cZhao-ge.\u201dThe tail end of his voice went a little hoarse. He called again, \u201cGe.\u201dXie Yu had already gotten He Zhao\u2019s jeans mostly undone and they hung loosely at his waist.He let go of Xie Yu\u2019s chin and leaned down, following the line of his waist downward.Xie Yu gave a muffled groan and was rendered completely speechless.Xie Yu rarely submitted. Even in bed, even being held down and touched, he was very stubborn. He Zhao\u2019s hand had been lightly holding the back of his neck, but now he gasped and moved it upwards several inches, landing in Xie Yu\u2019s hair.It was soft.And there was also the low moan, stifled, bitten back and held down, that belonged to him.Eventually, in the pitch darkness before his eyes.Xie Yu heard He Zhao repeat his name several times, very close by, right next to his ear. The voice mingled with the overwhelming pleasure.\u2026\u2026Xie Yu, who had recovered his \u2018top student\u2019 status less than 24 hours ago, walked into class the next day and immediately lay down on his desk to catch up on sleep.He didn\u2019t pay attention to class all morning.He sat in the last row, head pillowed in the crook of his elbow, looking very languid. His hair fell over his face, which was only half-visible. His features were chilly and even asleep he gave off an aura that made people afraid to get close to him.The stack of textbooks on his desk seemed to be brand new and showed no signs of having been used. Anyone who looked at him would not have associated him with the top scorer in the 4-school combined exams.If not for the grade sheet from the combined exams, which had been put up on the noticeboard, the teachers and students who looked at the familiar back of his head might have thought that everything that happened yesterday had been a dream.Every class period, after the dismissal bell rang, there would be students from other classes outside the window who snuck over for a look.Before, they had come to see the school tyrants, but now they had another thought: This was a walking 744 points. 744 points they wouldn\u2019t see even in their dreams.He Zhao reflected on himself, wondering if he had lost control and been too rough again last night. But he concluded he had not. Last night, this guy had clearly been overcome and even asked him to go faster. \u201cDoes it still hurt?\u201d\u201cTired.\u201d\u201cThen how were your ge\u2019s skills? I think your last assessment was not very objective.\u201dXie Yu did not want to bother with him. \u201cCan you get lost?\u201dHe Zhao now understood that Xie Yu was the sort who would pretend he didn\u2019t know you after getting out of bed.He reached out and ruffled his deskmate\u2019s hair. \u201cAll right, sleep then.\u201dClassroom 2.3 was relatively quiet.After midterm grades had been released, nearly every class period was spent going over the exam papers, and after going through the papers, they did corrections for the questions they got wrong.When the homework deadline approached, Xu Qingqing looked up from her math paper and counted the English homework next to her. She found that two people had not turned it in and called across the walkway between desks, \u201cZhao-ge, where\u2019s your homework?\u201dHe Zhao put a finger to his lips, indicating to her to be quieter, then answered honestly. \u201cI didn\u2019t do it.\u201dXu Qingqing walked over carrying the stack of homework. She glanced at the sleeping first-place, then at the second-place watching his deskmate sleep. She really did not understand the world they lived in.\u201cCan I ask why you didn\u2019t do it? If the teacher asks later, I won\u2019t know what to say.\u201d\u201cAbout that,\u201d He Zhao said, \u201cYou can tell her the homework she set was too easy.\u201dXu Qingqing: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWhen Xu Qingqing turned in the English homework, her legs were shaking. She had never thought that she would say the words, \u2018Your homework was too easy,\u2019 to a teacher while she was alive.Clearly, in the ten years or so the English teacher had been teaching, she hadn\u2019t encountered such an issue before either.The English teacher was silent for a moment, then she put her mug of tea down and said, \u201cAll right, I understand. Leave the papers here.\u201d\u201cThe homework was too easy?\u201d\u201cMr. Tang, what on earth is going on with these two from your class?\u201dSince the day grades were released, the Year 2 group of teachers had not had a moment of calm while they were in the office.When Dean Jiang had gotten the news, he had put his pants on backwards and ran over from the faculty dormitory. \u201cWhat? How many points?\u201dNot only Dean Jiang but the rest of Erzhong\u2019s school administration came one after the other to look at the papers. The principal had stared at the papers for a long time, speechless, and finally forced out the words, \u201cGood\u2026 good job! I\u2019m proud that they are students of Erzhong! Put this in the school history! Write that Erzhong\u2019s students worked a miracle, went against the odds, and beat all the four schools!\u201dAside from being curious, the other homeroom teachers also couldn\u2019t hide their envy. One class had produced two students who might score first place in the A City college exams\u2026\u201cThey\u2026 have special circumstances.\u201dTang Sen didn\u2019t know the details, either. He repeated, \u201cSpecial circumstances.\u201dSeveral teachers were currently discussing it in the faculty office when someone pushed open the door. The teacher currently getting water from the cooler called out in surprise, \u201cMiss Xu?\u201dXu Xia stood in the office doorway, a document in hand. Her expression was frozen. \u201cI\u2019m\u2026 here to look for Miss Wang. I have a document for her.\u201d\u201cMiss Wang isn\u2019t here. You can put it on her desk.\u201dXu Xia made a soft noise of assent.She had worked in this office before.Although it had not been for very long, she was still familiar with the office layout and decor.She looked around and eventually, as if possessed, her gaze landed on the desk she had occupied. Tang Sen was grading homework and felt something. He looked up and met Xu Xia\u2019s eyes.Tang Sen wasn\u2019t aware of all this. He smiled at her and considered that a greeting.Xu Xia smiled too, but her smile was a little forced. \u201cMr. Tang, I heard that your class produced two\u2026\u201dTang Sen had been deluged by the topic of grades for two days. He had long overcome his original shock and now just wanted this matter to blow over as quickly as possible so it wouldn\u2019t disrupt the two kids\u2019 everyday lives. \u201cAh, no, no. It\u2019s not worth mentioning.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dXu Xia would be lying if she said her feelings weren\u2019t complicated. In that complexity, what remained was mostly regret and dissatisfaction. The two high scores from Class 3 were not only so shocking it could make one\u2019s glasses fall off, all the subject teachers who taught Class 3 also shared in the glory.If she\u2026 if she was still teaching this class.That was what she thought, with some anger.But she wasn\u2019t sure who she was angry at, either.Now she suddenly remembered various little details from before. From the first time she saw them at the start of school to the day of the monthly exams when He Zhao had stood in the stairwell and asked her, Just because I get bad grades?Xu Xia didn\u2019t dare keep thinking along those lines. Her face was growing warm.If she kept thinking, she wouldn\u2019t be able to keep up an appearance of calm.She didn\u2019t stay any longer. She placed the document on Miss Wang\u2019s desk, turned, and left.\u201cXu Xia\u2019s face\u2026 you didn\u2019t see it. It was so satisfying.\u201dWan Da had slipped back from the faculty office and immediately caught hold of Liu Cunhao. One of them played Old Tang, the other Xu Xia. They took dramatic footsteps and yelled, \u201cAh, I heard your class\u2014\u201dLiu Cunhao waved a hand calmly. \u201cIt\u2019s not worth mentioning.\u201dClass 3 was in an uproar.Xie Yu shifted positions but still couldn\u2019t sleep for the noise. He sat up, but he couldn\u2019t get angry at Wan Da and the others when they had expressions of such silly happiness. He steadied himself and asked, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dSeeing he was awake, Wan Da was about to act it out again. Share the joy.But when he walked over he felt that something was amiss.Xie Yu had not done up his collar properly and he had been lying down, so after he got up, his collar had fallen open. Wan Da wondered what his Yu-ge had been up to last night. Such a rich night life. Now he was so tired he didn\u2019t seem to have any bones in his body.As Wan Da kept thinking, he glimpsed a very obvious red mark under Xie Yu\u2019s collarbone.But he only glimpsed it for a moment.\u201cYu-ge, didn\u2019t you close your dorm window properly?\u201dXie Yu tugged his open collar closed. \u201cWindow?\u201dWan Da remembered last time and thought Xie Yu probably had type O blood and attracted a lot of bugs and mosquitoes. He said, \u201cIt\u2019s nearly summer. Check your window screen.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dXie Yu had no idea what he was talking about.[]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 13": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fake Slackers104 \u2013 Best-case scenario, I can see him when I open my eyes every day.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayFake SlackersTranslator: JuryEditor: NomNomFirst Published on Chaleuria\u2014104 \u2013 Best-case scenario, I can see him when I open my eyes every day.Class 3 gathered around the back row.Xie Yu reached for the bottle of water at the corner of his desk and watched Wan Da dramatically act it out again.He Zhao was obligingly supportive, as always. \u201cVery good, very good. You act well.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d Wan Da gave a fist salute. \u201cAll thanks go to my countrymen for supporting me.\u201dXie Yu initially thought it uninteresting. He took a sip of water, then flipped his hand and screwed the bottlecap back on. But they were laughing so hard that in the end he couldn\u2019t help but laugh along with them. \u201c\u2026You all have nothing better to do?\u201dActually, before pulling his grades back up, Xie Yu had hesitated a little.But he gradually came to realize that whether his grades were good or not\u2014whether his grades pulled the class average down so low it made people want to shut their eyes and jump down from a high floor or pushed the class average \u20184.6 points higher\u2019 like now\u2014this lot\u2019s attitude towards him didn\u2019t change much.At first, he had wanted to beat them all up, but after a while he had more or less processed his feelings.When Liu Cunhao came to look for He Zhao to ask him how to do a problem, he even laughed. \u201cI really have to give in to you two. You really are the first of the big bros of our school\u2026 whether counting from the top or from the bottom.\u201d\u201cWhat does that mean? Is that praise or an insult?\u201dHe Zhao was looking at the problem\u2014Liu Cunhao had brought a question assigned by his home tutor\u2014and he said, pen in hand, \u201cI\u2019ll give you two minutes. Rephrase that statement.\u201dLiu Cunhao now understood the meaning of \u2018what goes around comes around.\u2019 Before, he had acted like he had seen a ghost when He Zhao volunteered his homework for him to copy, but now he understood what He Zhao had meant by \u2018beyond your reach.\u2019He shut his eyes and started ass-licking. \u201cYou\u2019re awesome! A man among men! The pride of Erzhong! So how is this question solved?\u201dWhen Liu Cunhao was done, he heard He Zhao say, \u201cThere are a few ways to solve this. Do you want the short and blunt way or something a little more creative\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dLiu Cunhao thought, Big bro, spare me. I just want to solve the question.Xie Yu couldn\u2019t take it any more. He plucked the exercise book straight out of He Zhao\u2019s hand. \u201cWhich question?\u201dXie Yu did not waste a single word when explaining the question. His logic was clear and within a few sentences, Liu Cunhao seemed to have been struck by lightning and all his trains of thought suddenly ran clear.He Zhao pointed to himself. \u201cDid I explain so badly?\u201dXie Yu retorted, \u201cBadly or not\u2026 don\u2019t you already know?\u201dLiu Cunhao listened to the explanation, then looked up at the two of them quarrelling as they always did.What he nearly said was: Whether counting from the top or from the bottom, you\u2019re still the two big bros we know\u2014He Zhao, who took blame he didn\u2019t need to shoulder in order to protect a girl, and Xie Yu, who rolled up his sleeves without a word and went down to the basketball court.From Class 3\u2019s point of view, what they thought of the two of them had long gone beyond grades. When class placements had first been announced, all they had known from rumors were that these two were school tyrants who intimidated everyone who heard of them, did every possible evil, and killed people without blinking.But after interacting with them, this wasn\u2019t the case at all.Xie Yu closed the exercise book and handed it back to Liu Cunhao. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Xue Xisheng watching them without blinking.His gaze was complicated and he stared them down until their hair stood on end.Every day, Xue Xisheng persistently tried to talk to them about studying methods and they couldn\u2019t avoid him no matter how they tried. \u201cIt\u2019s fine that you deliberately pulled the class average down, but can\u2019t you just talk to me a little about how you study?\u201dHe Zhao had also noticed the study rep\u2019s predatory gaze. He suggested, \u201cLet\u2019s go to Shen Jie\u2019s to hide out for a bit?\u201dXie Yu asked, \u201cYou sure?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dXie Yu continued, \u201cThat madman\u2026 better not.\u201dShen Jie had gone mad since about when the midterm grades had been out.Within a single day, his bro who usually only scored a few points on any exam had shot up into the clouds. He even stood ahead of Shen Jie telling him, \u2018Sorry, actually I\u2019m just that good.\u2019The guy who sat in front of Xie Yu during every exam was also in Class 8 and he and Shen Jie ranted at each other all day in a daze.That guy had always been in the last exam venue and no matter how he did in the exams\u2014no matter how badly he did\u2014there were always two people behind him, silently backing him up, so that he didn\u2019t fall into the bottom of the abyss. When exam grades were released, he could say to his parents with confidence, \u201cI\u2019m not the worst! Dad, Mom, look, there are two guys even worse than me!\u201dNow the two men behind him said goodbye and left just like that.He had lost all his will to live. The world had faded from color to black and white.As they were talking, someone knocked twice on the glass.Mad Dog\u2019s face appeared at the window like in a scary movie.He Zhao, who often used his phone in secret during evening self-study, had bad memories of being quietly observed by Mad Dog standing at the window. Now he felt a chill at his back.But this time Mad Dog didn\u2019t say much. He beckoned to the two \u2018Hopes of Erzhong.\u2019 \u201cThe two of you come out.\u201dThe whole way, Mad Dog kept saying, \u201cDon\u2019t be anxious later. Relax,\u201d and, \u201cShow the best face of Erzhong.\u201d It was getting more and more confusing.Instinct told him it wasn\u2019t anything good.They followed Mad Dog all the way to the door of the principal\u2019s office. Facing the plaque on the door, Xie Yu\u2019s left eyelid kept twitching. He had a bad premonition and had a faint guess as to what Mad Dog had dragged them over here for.\u201cHold up the exam paper and stand straight. All right, the two of you get closer together\u2026\u201d\u201cPrincipal Chen, please move a little to the side.\u201d\u201cChest out, chin up. I\u2019ll count down. Three, two, one. Yell eggplant.\u201dSix or seven people stood in the principal\u2019s office. Members of the school administration stood in two rows, wearing sharp suits.Erzhong\u2019s principal had a bald patch on top of his head, but he had stubbornly and meticulously applied hair gel to his few remaining strands of hair until they shone. He placed his hand on Xie Yu\u2019s shoulder and smiled, warm and genial. \u201cEggplant.\u201dHe Zhao said, \u201cEggplant.\u201dXie Yu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cSmile, student over there, could you smile a little?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be so\u2026\u201d The photographer was half-squatting and was about to say, \u201cDon\u2019t be so gloomy,\u201d but halfway through he thought the word wasn\u2019t quite fitting, so he changed his words. \u201cDon\u2019t be so serious.\u201dErzhong\u2019s principal had said he wanted to record them both in the school\u2019s history. Xie Yu had thought he was joking but the school administration had really hired a photographer to take photos of them.The moment he had walked through the door, before he could even assess the situation in the office, the school principal had hung a sash over his shoulder.The sash was red with yellow words, bordered on both sides with gold. On it was written: Top Student.\u201cRecord it in the school\u2019s history! This photo must be right in the middle!\u201d\u201cErzhong\u2019s students have worked a miracle. Let\u2019s write a headline\u2026\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re just very happy.\u201d After the photo shoot, Dean Jiang couldn\u2019t take it, either, and brought them out. \u201cYou still have afternoon classes, right? Go back quickly.\u201dXie Yu pulled the sash off his chest without another word.He Zhao shut the door and was about to go downstairs, then stopped in the doorway of the stairwell. \u201cDean Jiang?\u201dDean Jiang looked back. \u201cWas there something else?\u201dHe Zhao smiled and said, \u201cI did all right on the exams.\u201d\u201cMm?\u201d\u201cMy deskmate did quite well, too.\u201dThis was a fairly deep ruse, and Dean Jiang still didn\u2019t understand what He Zhao was saying. \u201cMm.\u201dThen He Zhao said, \u201cSo, can we change dorm rooms now?\u201dBefore, when He Zhao had applied to change dorm rooms, Dean Jiang had been unbelievably mad. The two bottom-of-the-year students wanting to room together\u2014they must have gone mad from playing too much. He kicked them out without even thinking about it.Who would have known they were still thinking about it.Dean Jiang hesitated. \u201cYou two\u2026\u201dHe Zhao said, \u201cWe\u2019re helping each other. We\u2019re studying together and improving together.\u201dXie Yu leaned against the railing in the stairwell. As he listened to He Zhao bullshitting, he lifted a leg and kicked him lightly.Dean Jiang thought about it for a while. He thought about their grades this time around and fell for He Zhao\u2019s bluff that they were \u2018improving together.\u2019 Eventually he relented and said, \u201cAll right. Fill in the application form and turn it in at my office before school\u2019s dismissed.\u201dErzhong was very efficient.After turning in the application form, the procedures were completed in short order.That evening, after self-study, the occupant list next to Xie Yu\u2019s door had an additional name on it.Xie Yu had gotten used to living alone. Several mock exams lay spread out on his desk and he sat in his chair with one leg bent as he watched He Zhao run about. The other half of his room, which had been empty, was now being filled, and he wasn\u2019t yet used to it.He tried to turn his attention to the question he was doing, but he only looked briefly before putting down his pen again. He discovered that He Zhao had already packed up the few things he had into cardboard boxes. \u201cWhen did you start packing?\u201d\u201cA few days ago.\u201d\u201cI wanted to be closer to my little friend.\u201d He Zhao had made several trips to move his things and he was sweating a little. As he took off his jacket, he continued, \u201cBest-case scenario, the sort of close where I can see him when I open my eyes every day.\u201dXie Yu was stunned.By the time He Zhao had set up the bed, he belatedly realized that he had forgotten the requirements of those questions from just now.He Zhao didn\u2019t have many things and was able to move them all with just a few boxes. He also moved over the \u2018Preparing for the college exams\u2019 notice that he had had up on his door for a long time.He Zhao had just finished unpacking and had taken a change of clothes to the bathroom to shower when Aunt Mei called.Xu Yanmei was so emotional she couldn\u2019t speak clearly. \u201cYou really scored first?\u201dListening to the running water in the bathroom, Xie Yu distractedly said, \u201cMm.\u201d\u201cThat one at home, that idiot guy, he didn\u2019t give you trouble, did he?\u201d Xu Yanmei calmed down, then followed \u2018idiot guy\u2019 up with another barrage of curses.Xie Yu\u2019s mind went in a few circles before he matched the name \u2018idiot guy\u2019 to Zhong Jie.\u201cNo, so don\u2019t worry about nothing.\u201dXie Yu had no idea what reaction Zhong Jie might have had. Madam Gu said not to worry about it. Grades had been out for a few days and he had not received a call from Zhong Jie.They chatted for a little while and Xie Yu worked out the last problem sum at hand while he talked.\u201cAll right, I won\u2019t go on any more. Take care of your health\u2026\u201dXie Yu waited for Aunt Mei to finish nagging before he hung up the phone and tossed it aside. Then he saw a certain person, who had finished showering but had not properly put on his clothes, pull open the door and walk out.He Zhao\u2019s hair was still wet. He wore only a button-down and he had not done up many of the buttons.Xie Yu thought that sharing a dorm room with this guy was probably not a wise decision.[]The Fake Slackers Vol. 1 ebook has been released!

    "Chapter 14": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fake Slackers105 \u2013 He didn\u2019t dare sleep.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayFake SlackersTranslator: LyraEditor: NomNomFirst Published on Chaleuria\u2014105 \u2013 He didn\u2019t dare sleep.\u201cDo you know how to wear your clothes properly?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dXie Yu pointed at the shirt He Zhao was wearing.He Zhao closed the bathroom door, completely focused on drying his hair. He had initially wanted to come out of the bathroom shirtless. \u201cYou\u2019ve already seen me naked before, don\u2019t be shy.\u201dXie Yu shifted and turned over to straddle the chair, the front of his body facing the back of the chair. His wrists loosely hung from the backrest and his slender legs were bent. He curled his index finger to summon He Zhao from this position.He Zhao finished rubbing his hair with a towel carelessly, then slung it over his neck.When he got closer, Xie Yu reached out to help him button his shirt starting from the bottom button, one button at a time.Xie Yu\u2019s fingers worked slowly, occasionally brushing his abdomen through the fabric with a force that was neither too heavy nor too light.At first He Zhao thought nothing of it, but they were so close and once Xie Yu\u2019s fingers finished the buttons at his abdomen and moved to the buttons at his chest, it finally became a bit too much for He Zhao to take.Xie Yu\u2019s gaze trailed upward as his fingers continued to work with the buttons, his eyes meeting He Zhao\u2019s when he reached the top buttons.Neither of them spoke.After staring into each other\u2019s eyes for a few moments, He Zhao bent down slightly. Just as he was about to lower his head, loud knocks came from the door to their room.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cBig bro!\u201d\u201cAre you there?\u201d\u201cHello?\u201dSeveral voices came from outside the door. Wan Da\u2019s loud voice stood out. His call of \u201cbig bro\u201d was especially enthusiastic.He Zhao\u2019s Adam\u2019s apple bobbed. \u201c\u2026Fuck.\u201dHearing that, Xie Yu was a bit amused. His hand moved upward a few inches, simply grabbing He Zhao by the collar and yanking him closer without another word.He Zhao immediately lost his balance.Xie Yu didn\u2019t control his strength very well and his actions were straightforward and rough. He pecked He Zhao on the lips in a placating manner.And then, Xie Yu let go and pointed at the door with his chin. \u201cGo open the door.\u201dThe students of Class 3 who lived in the dorms waited for a couple of minutes in front of the door. Just as they were ready to bang on the door again, it was pulled open from the inside before they had a chance to touch it.He Zhao blocked the view through the door and asked, \u201cIs there anything you need?\u201dWan Da shoved an apple snatched from another dorm room into his hands. \u201cZhao-ge, we heard that you moved into a new dorm room? Congratulations on moving into your new room, we are here to celebrate with you.\u201dHolding the apple, He Zhao thought that this bunch was just too enthusiastic. \u201cThanks\u2026 I\u2019m only moving across the corridor.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, moving across is still moving!\u201dAlthough they stated it was to celebrate his moving, it was only an excuse. Every one of them carried thick workbooks in their hands, looking as if they would take out little stools and sit down in a row to listen to the teacher\u2019s lesson at any moment.There were just too many questions to ask and Xie Yu was not the kind of person who would patiently answer them again and again. He pressed the spot between his eyebrows and told the guy at the back of the line, \u201cTry feeling the question out by yourself again.\u201dHe Zhao added, \u201cClose your eyes and feel it with your heart.\u201dWan Da sighed while holding the math workbook. \u201cI\u2019ve already spent more than forty minutes in my dorm trying to connect with this problem on a spiritual level. I\u2019ve tried feeling it for so long but I still don\u2019t know what it wants to say.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter sighing, Wan Da glanced between the people in queue at the half-finished test sheet on Xie Yu\u2019s desk.With how hard those questions were, he wouldn\u2019t be able to solve them even if he was given forty hours to do the test, much less forty minutes.He Zhao\u2019s arrogant declaration of the homework being too easy surprisingly didn\u2019t really upset the teachers. They gave these two students a different set of assignments according to their ability. Wu Zheng, in particular, even assigned them math problems as hard as those given out by the top-tier schools.Wan Da had heard Wu Zheng talking cheerfully in the office. \u201cI always suppress my desires as there are many difficult problems that I shouldn\u2019t assign \u2026I don\u2019t believe I can\u2019t stump them with these. Do they think I\u2019m one to be underestimated?\u201dAfter the question-and-answer session ended, it was almost time for the lights to go out. The dorm supervisor downstairs whistled as he walked back and forth, the flashlight he was holding flashing in different directions. The light occasionally passed through a dorm room\u2019s window, illuminating the whole dorm room.Xie Yu was just about to send them away when he realized this bunch had gotten together and started chatting and the topic quickly drifted off into a weird direction, \u201cI downloaded a movie last weekend, want to watch together?\u201d\u201cWhat kind of movie?\u201d\u201cWhat kind of movie could it be? A movie for men, of course.\u201dThere were only a few ways for guys to spice up their night lives.Xie Yu had no intention of joining in the high school boys\u2019 passionate midnight chat and neither did he want to watch a movie to spice up his night life. However, the three words, \u201cno, get lost,\u201d were no use as the classmate had already found the video on his phone. \u201cLet me tell you, this one\u2019s really exciting. It\u2019s a movie so exceptional you can\u2019t get enough of it\u2013\u201dOthers were fascinated. \u201cOh?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t mess around, go back to your own room to watch\u2026\u201d He Zhao said.Before he could finish the sentence, a terrifying and harsh sound effect burst out in the dorm room.Mysterious, spooky, trembling.A silhouette slowly appeared on the previously dark screen of the phone. The figure was holding a dirty doll in their hands as the lens zoomed in on them\u2014when the camera couldn\u2019t get any closer, the figure finally raised their head in a sudden motion, revealing a face littered with frightening scars which had been hidden behind their long locks!They had an odd smile on their lips and the corners of their mouth lifted up as their smile grew wider and wider.Title of the movie: Harassed by a Malicious Spirit\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe Zhao grabbed Xie Yu\u2019s hand almost as soon as the sound effect blasted out. He froze for a few moments as a swear word stuck in his throat. He managed to swallow it down with difficulty.Damn.Exciting, sure.\u201cI know about this one. It\u2019s adapted from a novel and the original author wrote really well. I didn\u2019t dare to sleep for two consecutive nights when I read it as a kid.\u201d Only after Wan Da finished speaking did he realize the two big bros seemed to have said something. \u201cYu-ge, what did you say?\u201dHe Zhao heard his conscienceless boyfriend beside him correct himself. \u201cNothing, the movie is alright.\u201d\u201cRight, what about Zhao-ge?\u201d Wan Da asked again.With Xie Yu\u2019s knuckles against his palm, He Zhao\u2019s grip grew tighter.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s that good.\u201d He Zhao\u2019s first-class acting ability showed no flaws. \u201cThe plot is so clich\u00e9. It looks fake and there\u2019s no mood at all. You couldn\u2019t sleep for two nights because of this?\u201dThe others didn\u2019t notice anything wrong with what he said and were instantly won over.Xie Yu couldn\u2019t hold back from saying, \u201cShouldn\u2019t you let go of my hand before saying this?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not letting go,\u201d He Zhao replied.The dorm room with the lights off was pitch-dark and you couldn\u2019t even see the outlines of your own hands clearly.The light from the phone illuminated the guys\u2019 faces and, coupled with the movie\u2019s sound effect, it was actually quite eerie.Xie Yu didn\u2019t react much to the horrifying scenes. It was all because of this bunch\u2019s jumpy and nervous reactions that the roughly made and deliberately cryptic horror film\u2019s atmosphere was raised to an unexpected level.\u201cDamn!\u201d\u201cMy god!\u201d\u201cIs this one going to die too?\u201d\u201cMy hand is a bit sore, wait a second, let me find a place to prop up this phone\u2026\u201dHe Zhao could only pretend to be brave in front of Wan Da and company. After everyone was completely immersed in the movie\u2019s plot, he finally said in a low voice, \u201cThis movie is too damn scary.\u201dXie Yu used his own words to call him out, his words a perfect imitation, \u201cThe plot is clich\u00e9 and there\u2019s no mood.\u201dHe Zhao responded, \u201cReally, that\u2019s enough.\u201dHe Zhao\u2019s grip was tight.Xie Yu didn\u2019t speak again. His eyes stayed on the screen of the phone while he moved his wrists and his five fingers wriggled in between He Zhao\u2019s fingers.The table was too short and the person holding the phone up was a bit tired, so he searched everywhere for a place to prop up the phone.In the middle of the search, a scene of the malicious spirit suddenly appeared. Someone to the side panicked and pulled at whoever was closest to him and the phone was dropped in the chaos.It was an arduous experience to watch this movie of one and a half hours. During this period of time, the phone was dropped three times.\u201cBe still, don\u2019t drop it, do you still want this phone or not?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m still, but someone\u2019s pulling at me.\u201dAfter the credits scene rolled, this bunch hesitated for a while before leaving, hoping to group up to go back to their rooms. \u201cIs there anyone else headed to the fourth floor?\u201dAs they walked through the corridor, Wan Da couldn\u2019t help but exclaim, \u201cThe big bros are really big bros, they were so calm.\u201dHowever, the calm big bro who had looked down on the person \u201cnot daring to sleep at night\u201d asked the instant he closed the door, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we sleep together?\u201dXie Yu gave him a look from his seat on the bed, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you don\u2019t dare sleep alone.\u201dHe Zhao was a flexible person. \u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe night-time movie sessions were probably the only pastime for the second year students who lived in the dorms.Third year, the college entrance exam.This topic was mentioned again and again upon entering high school as a first year student, but they had never felt the urgency of it. They thought there was still plenty of time and it was still a long way off.However, the rankings of the joint exam of the four schools brought on the stress of the college entrance exam for the second year test-takers sooner than they expected.It was also the first time they felt the exact stage of life they were at and what one more step meant.The third year of high school was only a few steps away.\u201cIf nothing unexpected comes up, we have to cut our summer vacations short and return to school. The school has decided to schedule additional lessons earlier to try and finish a round of review before summer vacation ends.\u201dAfter the midterms ended, it was time to prepare for the finals right away. Many students were looking forward to the vacation and Old Tang decided to give them a reminder, \u201cDon\u2019t worry if you didn\u2019t do well on the rankings this time, we still have more than a year\u2019s time\u2026.\u201dDuring self-study period in the morning, Old Tang made an all-around divergent speech on the subject. In the end, the speech dovetailed into another direction and Xie Yu stopped listening halfway through.He had slept crammed together with He Zhao the whole night and now he felt uncomfortable all over. He was itching to kick the person back into the room across the corridor.The only thing was that He Zhao\u2019s state after waking up was so particularly overwhelming that it even soothed Xie Yu\u2019s grumpy temper.Not to mention his habit of sleeping in, even if he was made to get up, he would put his head on Xie Yu\u2019s shoulders with half-lidded eyes. With a toothbrush in his mouth, he\u2019d murmur, \u201cWanna sleep.\u201dThey had often visited each other\u2019s room before, but there still seemed to be something different after they moved in together.With his chin resting on his hand, Xie Yu looked at the person beside him and thought back to He Zhao\u2019s words from when he was moving his stuff over. \u201c\u2026see him when I open my eyes everyday.\u201d[]Lyra translated this chapter \u2013 thank you!The Fake Slackers Vol. 1 ebook has been released \u2013 check it out on Amazon.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He thought he still had plenty of time and was going to go over a classical poem with the class, but little did he know that morning self-study was already almost over.\u201cHas it been so long?\u201dOld Tang was both confused and conflicted, but he had to pick up his tea mug and walk out. \u201cI just said a couple things\u2026\u201dHe Zhao stretched lazily, his hand lifting and coming to rest at the back of his head. He smiled and said, \u201cSir, that was more than a couple things. You don\u2019t know yourself very well yet.\u201d\u201cStop bullshitting.\u201d Tang Sen smiled as well and said, \u201cRemember to bring your and Xie Yu\u2019s homework by later. I\u2019ll grade them individually.\u201dHe Zhao waited for Old Tang to walk out, then dropped his hand and knocked on Xie Yu\u2019s desk. \u201cI didn\u2019t finish it. Where\u2019s yours? Can I borrow it?\u201dAt the mention of homework, Xie Yu frowned and said, \u201cYou think I did mine?\u201dHe Zhao said, \u201cYou didn\u2019t?\u201dHow could I have done it.How dare you ask.Xie Yu internally cursed.It had been very late by the time they finished watching the film yesterday. He Zhao had closed the door and gone on about \u2018sleeping together,\u2019 and Xie Yu had eventually relented since he couldn\u2019t out-talk him. \u201cAll right, let\u2019s sleep. Don\u2019t make a fuss.\u201dHis boyfriend\u2019s approval wasn\u2019t enough. He Zhao waited outside the bathroom door the whole time Xie Yu was in the bathroom and showering.It was too dark in the dorm room.The 1.85m tall boy turned on his phone\u2019s flashlight, his back to the bathroom door.\u201cAre you done showering?\u201d\u201cHow about this? Can I go in and wait for you?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dXie Yu was exasperated. He shut his eyes, water flowing down his face.Then he turned his head and forcefully pressed the showerhead lever down. He reached for the dry towel he had put to one side and said, \u201cCome in. Just try coming in and see if you get out alive.\u201dHe hurried him so much just for a shower. Xie Yu, on the other hand, wanted to finish his homework before going to bed.But had the idiot given him the chance?He Zhao clearly remembered what he had done last night. He coughed lightly and changed the subject. \u201cHow about this? Let\u2019s split the work. You do math and I\u2019ll do the rest.\u201dXie Yu had no objections to this division of labor.They both did the homework quickly. By the time the first chemistry period was half over, they had finished most of the homework for the various subjects.He Zhao was left with two English passages to translate and he still tried to explain himself as he wrote. \u201cGe is still a strong man, but there are many unexpected things in life. Maybe Heaven didn\u2019t want me to be too perfect\u2026\u201dXie Yu was erasing his diagrams, about to start over with a new approach.Old Wu had given them difficult questions recently, as if trying to give them a hard time. Xie Yu had been stuck on the last question for nearly ten minutes. When he heard He Zhao, he turned and threw the eraser. \u201cPerfect, my ass. Can you shut up?\u201dThe moment the chemistry teacher packed up his things and left at the end of the period, the last row of the classroom broke out in a fight.\u201cFighting again?\u201d Liu Cunhao was about to get up and collect homework, but when he heard the commotion he glanced at the back row. \u201cOur two big bros are so passionate today?\u201dLuo Wenqiang folded up his mock paper and fanned himself. \u201cAren\u2019t they warm?\u201dLiu Cunhao said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go and turn on the fan for them, then?\u201dNear June, the weather was gradually growing hotter.Another year, another summer.He Zhao often really wanted to strip naked in his own dorm room, and walked about in front of Xie Yu all the time with his clothes in disarray. At first, Xie Yu had commented on it, but eventually he let him be.He couldn\u2019t beat him in shamelessness.When Gu Xuelan occasionally called Xie Yu, she discovered that her son\u2019s dorm room had grown much rowdier.Before they could exchange a couple sentences, she would hear her son say, tone frustrated but also accommodating, \u201cDon\u2019t make a fuss,\u201d or \u201cCan you go away.\u201dGu Xuelan paused and couldn\u2019t keep herself from asking, \u201cWho is that?\u201d\u201cRoommate. My deskmate. He moved here a while ago.\u201d Xie Yu lifted a hand to press at his forehead; he felt a headache coming on. Seeing Gu Xuelan still had no reaction, he continued, \u201c\u2014The one who always scored bottom of the year.\u201dNow Gu Xuelan remembered, somewhat.He Zhao had finished sunning his clothes and walked back from the balcony.He Zhao wasn\u2019t shy around strangers at all. He opened his mouth to greet her and hearing Xie Yu call her \u2018Mom,\u2019 he nearly followed suit. Only when his waist was pinched did he change what he was about to say. \u201c\u2026Hello, Aunt.\u201dGu Xuelan chatted with Xie Yu\u2019s \u2018roommate\u2019 through the phone line.He Zhao\u2019s voice was bright and he was a good conversationalist, so people quickly warmed to him.Xie Yu said, \u201cMom\u2026\u201dGu Xuelan was currently chatting up a storm with He Zhao and ignored her own son. \u201cLet He Zhao come to the phone. I want to chat with him. You can keep doing your homework.\u201dXie Yu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe Zhao stood behind Xie Yu, one hand on Xie Yu\u2019s shoulder. When he heard this, he took the phone and said quietly, \u201cDon\u2019t be jealous. Your ge used to be famous for being friends with all the middle-aged ladies in a ten-mile radius.\u201d\u201cTsk.\u201dXie Yu ignored him.With people his own age, He Zhao\u2019s EQ was negative.But he could establish a presence among middle-aged women.Gu Xuelan took the rare opportunity to chat with someone Xie Yu\u2019s age. \u201cXie Yu has a bad temper. If he\u2019s offended you, you don\u2019t have to take it\u2026 I know what he\u2019s like.\u201dHe Zhao glanced at him and smiled. \u201cHis temper is a little quick.\u201dGu Xuelan said, \u201cYeah. I don\u2019t know who he took after.\u201dIt was not yet hot enough to need the air-conditioning, so Xie Yu got up to open the window.Wind blew in through the cracks, gust after gust, and he felt much more clearheaded facing the breeze.\u201cAll right.\u201d Xie Yu snatched his phone and said, \u201cAre you done?\u201dBefore Gu Xuelan hung up the phone, she continued, \u201cWhen are the end-of-term tests? Soon, right? Although your grades weren\u2019t bad last time, you can\u2019t get cocky\u2026\u201dCounting the days on one\u2019s fingers, the end-of-term exams weren\u2019t far away.Rumor had it the end-of-term tests would be even more formal than the midterm tests. A combined exam of all four schools was child\u2019s play. This time, all the high schools in A City might be taking the same exam.Early in the morning, to the sound of the fan turning in the broadcast room, Dean Jiang added to the hot summer heat. \u201cStudents, the end-of-term exams are upon us. Are you prepared? Competition is cruel and those who do not strive hard will be eliminated. You have to fight your hardest! Fight! Burn, like the sun!\u201dGroans filled the dormitory building. \u201cI really have to thank you.\u201d\u201cThe weather is terrible. Even if I don\u2019t move I might spontaneously combust\u2026\u201dXie Yu felt a headache coming on.He stayed in bed for a while, then got up, about to go and wash up. He only got up halfway before a certain person still lazing in bed stretched out an arm and pulled him over.\u201cSleep a while more.\u201d He Zhao didn\u2019t open his eyes and said in a hoarse voice, \u201c\u2026Don\u2019t move so much.\u201dMad Dog\u2019s broadcast could be heard all the way from the dorm building to the classroom building.\u201cAfter the last exam, there were many changes to the exam venues. And the two students who massacred your way out of the last exam venue, continue with your momentum and rush forward! Work miracles! Nothing is impossible!\u201dThe two students who had massacred their way out of the last exam venue were currently in a life-and-death fight on the bed.At first, Xie Yu just wanted to push him away, but He Zhao refused to let go and, after a little back-and-forth, the struggle changed its tone.He Zhao\u2019s chest was half visible, the look in his eyes dark and indiscernible. His shirt fell downward and Xie Yu could see the outline of He Zhao\u2019s abs hidden beneath his clothes.\u201cI said don\u2019t move.\u201d\u201cThen stop rutting.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe Zhao sighed before levering himself up and off his boyfriend\u2019s body.Erzhong placed a lot of importance on the upcoming end-of-term exams.In summer, the weather was hot and dry. On the food street outside school, the banners were burned beneath the sun, the gold words flashing.They were still the same old phrases. The restaurants had gotten their exam banners all at the same time, and they brought them out and hung them up at the same time every year.\u2014Get good grades!\u2014Welcome the end of term! 20% storewide discount!The pressure of the looming exams lasted until exam day. On the day itself, everyone silently arranged their tables and chairs and went to their assigned exam venues, to their deaths.The process of moving seats was fairly calm and organized.Xie Yu flipped through the questions he had gotten wrong before and considered it revision. It took no more than five minutes.Over the intercom, the exam announcements were played twice.\u201cHello, everyone. Before I go, I\u2019ll read out my will.\u201d Liu Cunhao had his exam materials with him as he stood at the podium saying weakly, \u201cIf I unfortunately pass away, my max-level mage in Genesis will be given unconditionally to my good bro Wan Da.\u201dWan Da said, \u201cHao-zi, although you\u2019re being ridiculous, I\u2019m actually a little touched?\u201dLiu Cunhao continued tragically, \u201cMy No. 24 basketball jersey, my religion\u2014will be given to my good bro Luo Wenqiang.\u201dLuo Wenqiang got up and bowed to the podium, getting deep into character. \u201c\u2026I\u2019ll keep it safe!\u201d\u201cWhat about Old Xie and I?\u201dHe Zhao looked at the scene for a long time and was amused. He raised his voice. \u201cWe\u2019re not bros?\u201dLiu Cunhao\u2019s initially faint voice now increased 80% in volume. He exploded on the spot. \u201cYou, from the first exam venue, in seat No. 2, have no right to anything I bequeath! And the guy next to you, too! Neither of you have inheritance rights!\u201dHe Zhao: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dXie Yu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dLiu Cunhao wasn\u2019t the only person whose emotions were in upheaval. Everyone in the first exam venue felt that they were dreaming.The first exam venue\u2026 the people in it were always the same, none of them cheated, and they faced every exam venue solemnly and sincerely. But this time they warily welcomed the two school tyrants.The first exam venue was already full of people, aside from the first two seats in the first column, which were still empty.The other students looked at the two empty spots and whispered, \u201cIt\u2019s really the two of them?\u201d\u201cMy hands are shaking a little.\u201d\u201cStudents, take note. The exam will begin in five minutes. Please return to your exam venues\u2026\u201dAs the broadcast began, the sounds of chattering suddenly stopped.Year 2, Class 1.Xie Yu walked in front. When he got to the venue, he glanced at the sign on the door.\u2014Then he reached out and pushed open the door to the first exam venue.[]The Fake Slackers Vol. 1 ebook has been released!

The students here were all top students who used every spare minute to go through their books. Even if only one second remained, they would make the most of it and look up another two English words.When Xie Yu pushed the door open, he was stunned for a second.He Zhao walked in behind him.He looked languid and indolent, and a black gel pen was stuffed carelessly in his uniform pocket. He didn\u2019t look at all like he was going to an exam.Before he reached the classroom doorway, he leaned against the window and greeted the students in the classroom, who he didn\u2019t know. \u201cHi, friends.\u201dNobody present dared make a sound, aside from Xue Xisheng\u2014the Class 3 study rep who sat in the sixth seat in the first column. Although his grades did not rank at the very top, they were solid and he was always among the top 10 in the year.Xue Xisheng frowned and looked up from his English vocabulary. \u201cClassmate He Zhao, please be quiet.\u201dHe Zhao signed back, No problem.Xie Yu didn\u2019t have nearly as much to say. He reached behind him, caught hold of the idiot He Zhao\u2019s sleeve, and yanked.\u201cThe exam is about to begin. Students, please put away all materials not needed for the exam\u2014\u201dThe announcement was replayed a few times.Xie Yu pulled out his chair, which made a light scraping sound against the floor. He felt the girl next to him tremble before he could sit down. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAm I very scary?\u201dThe invigilating teacher had not yet arrived. Xie Yu leaned back in his chair and whispered, \u201cWhy did she look like she\u2019d seen a ghost?\u201dHe Zhao followed Xie Yu\u2019s gaze and saw the girl in the next row. Not only were her hands still shaking, she seemed like she didn\u2019t even dare breathe too hard.He Zhao thought, How could he be scary? My little friend is so cute.But before the words left his mouth he was struck by the urge to tease him. \u201cA little. Why don\u2019t you smile to show you\u2019re friendly?\u201d\u201cI can laugh in your face.\u201d \u00b9He Zhao reached out to touch the corner of Xie Yu\u2019s mouth, about to pull his face into a friendly smile.Xie Yu didn\u2019t know what this guy was doing. He turned his head, about to ask how many pens He Zhao had brought, but He Zhao\u2019s index finger brushed the corner of his mouth and landed squarely on his lips before he could say anything.Both of them froze.It wasn\u2019t a drastic movement, but the position was suggestive in an indefinable way.The girl in the next row over was shaking even harder now. She couldn\u2019t hold her pen properly and it fell from between her fingers, clattering to the desk.She was internally breaking down. The exam hadn\u2019t even begun and she had already snapped.To say nothing of the fright\u2026Why did the two school tyrants look so\u2026 the scene should not be spoken of?Several minutes before the exam bell, the invigilating teacher walked across the corridor carrying the exam papers.The top students in the first exam venue were only concerned about the exam difficulty, looked only at the exam questions, and didn\u2019t care who the invigilating teacher was.Their heads were bent as they reviewed and they heard only the clacking of high-heeled shoes coming closer.A moment passed before He Zhao retracted his hand, some warmth still lingering on the pad of his finger.\u201cLast time was a fluke.\u201d Somewhat stiffly, he picked up the pen on his desk. Then he continued, \u201cIf you don\u2019t believe it, let\u2019s compete again this time?\u201dXie Yu smiled slightly. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t an accident. Those two points you lost are the distance between you and me.\u201dMore accurately, it was the distance between him and an idiot.Their abilities were the same. If they were to truly compete, just one or two points would decide who won and who lost.Xie Yu thought carefully. Ever since he was young, his only interest in grades and year placement\u2014the only thing he considered his goal and fought for\u2014had been the position of \u2018bottom of the year.\u2019The high-heeled shoes stopped in the doorway of Class 2.1.Xu Xia internally told herself, \u2018They\u2019re just two students,\u2019 then pushed open the classroom door and walked in.Xu Xia\u2019s face was blank. The moment she walked in, she began counting the exam papers.He Zhao was a little surprised. He glanced at her and stopped spinning his pen for a couple seconds. \u201c\u2026It\u2019s her.\u201dXu Xia had split up the papers by rows, then looked up. Her gaze swept across the two people in the first column.Xie Yu didn\u2019t even glance at her. The exam papers had not even been distributed and he just lay down on the table to sleep.The person behind him\u2013sitting sideways with his back to the wall, posture languid and careless\u2014met her eyes without hesitation when she looked over.\u2026\u2026Awkwardness, shame, and some other indescribable emotion made her avert her eyes swiftly.The exam bell rang.She let out a breath.The Class 1 exam venue didn\u2019t really need to be observed. Xu Xia sat by the podium for a while, then stood up and walked around the classroom twice.To the sound of the exam papers being flipped, she suddenly thought about the two inexplicably high scores again.There was a little disbelief in her heart, and curiosity, which compelled her\u2026 On her second trip around the classroom, she finally slowed her steps and glanced at Xie Yu and He Zhao\u2019s exam papers, as if by accident.That glance beat back all the cries of \u2018Impossible\u2019 in her heart.Who knew if the weather was too hot or she really couldn\u2019t breathe.Xu Xia felt her chest grow heavy for a long time.Xie Yu hadn\u2019t noticed that Xu Xia was doing such underhanded things things even though she was invigilating the exam. The questions were indeed very difficult on the A City unified exam and there were several where he wasn\u2019t sure if he had answered to the point.The end-of-term exams spanned two consecutive days.When the exams ended, the students returned to their original classrooms and everybody compared answers.\u201cHao-zi.\u201d Wan Da had just returned from his exam venue and he held the doorway with one hand, face grim. \u201cSorry, I might not be able to inherit your max-level mage account. I\u2019m going to die too.\u201dLuo Wenqiang said, \u201cMe too. I won\u2019t make it, either.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dLiu Cunhao inwardly grieved. He hadn\u2019t expected that the heirs to his inheritance would also leave the world one by one. After a period of grief, he raised his voice and kept going. \u201cZhao-ge, how do you all feel?\u201dHe Zhao was forever full of confidence. \u201cVery good.\u201dLiu Cunhao said, \u201cYour feelings aren\u2019t accurate. You told me last time you did exceptionally well. It was exceptional. So exceptional, it\u2019s abnormal.\u201dHe Zhao objected to being called \u2018abnormal.\u2019 \u201cWhat\u2019s abnormal about me?\u201dXie Yu said, \u201cThink about the handwriting points you lost before you talk. Does such mischief make you happy?\u201dHe Zhao fell silent.The class quarrelled for a while, then Old Tang walked in and started talking about the vacation and returning to school.\u201cFor these two weeks, everyone, build up your strength and save up your acuity. The coming year will be very arduous. If you go out during the holidays, stay safe.\u201d Old Tang had overseen many graduating classes, and when the subject of Year 3 came up, he couldn\u2019t help worrying for these kids.The vacation was too short. So short, it was tragic.It only lasted a few days and students spent most of that time being sent to all kinds of remedial classes by their parents. Nobody had looked forward to this vacation in the least, and they didn\u2019t care much for Old Tang\u2019s reminders, either. \u201cOkay, got it.\u201d\u201cWhen you go, make sure to pack all your things. After coming back to school, we won\u2019t be in this classroom any more. We\u2019ll be in the Zhi Yuan building.\u201d\u00b2Erzhong distributed its students well among its school buildings. Zhi Yuan was further from the quad and was therefore relatively more quiet. The third-year students occupied this building every year.The sign on the door changed from Class 2.3 to Class 3.3.The vacation-which-might-as-well-have-not-existed passed and everybody still thought it a novel experience on the day they went back for supplementary lessons.Liu Cunhao had gained a \u2018big bro\u2019 attitude from somewhere. He felt that even when he walked he could hold his back straighter. He was living at school this term and he said as he packed his things, \u201cWe\u2019re the most senior in Erzhong now! Everybody in Erzhong has to respectfully call me Senior!\u201dXie Yu had just finished showering when Liu Cunhao\u2019s voice came from the other end of the corridor.Barefoot, he kicked He Zhao who had lain down on his bed the moment he got into the dorm room. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? They\u2019re all staying at school this semester?\u201dHe Zhao didn\u2019t open his eyes. \u201cThey said going back and forth from home wastes too much time. They need every second to prepare for the college exams.\u201dIt would be a riot.Class 3, all together. And preparing for the college exams. Who knew; they might just mess around every day.\u201cAre you going to shower or not?\u201d Xie Yu asked.Outside, the sun was hot and the weather was warm.He Zhao had intended to down for a while and wait for his little friend to finish showering before he went. Now that the heat had mostly subsided and he was too lazy to move, he replied, \u201cDid you miss me?\u201dThe vacation hadn\u2019t lasted long and they had either video chatted or called every day. Compared to him, Madam Gu seemed to miss this \u2018middle-aged ladies\u2019 friend\u2019 even more.\u201cWhen he has some time, invite him home for a visit? Mom will cook whatever you want to eat.\u201d\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have time.\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t even ask. How do you know he doesn\u2019t have time?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe Zhao lifted a hand to shield his eyes and rested a while longer before getting up to get a change of clothes and shower.\u201cDo we have apples in the dorm room?\u201d Halfway through showering, he thought about Wan Da\u2019s housewarming gift. He stuck out his head and asked, \u201cShould we give them some too?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dThey had just gotten back to school. How would they have apples?In the end, Liu Cunhao and the other \u2018new residents\u2019 received a piece of A4 paper.Luo Wenqiang was currently cleaning and he curiously flipped over the paper. \u201cWhat is this\u2014\u201dHe Zhao said, \u201cSomething good.\u201dXie Yu leaned against the door. He didn\u2019t really want to look.On the A4 paper were the two words \u2018He Zhao\u2019 in an energetic, flying script. It occupied a lot of space, more than half the sheet.Luo Wenqiang: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dLiu Cunhao: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAll the new live-in students: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWhat was this? He gave them his autograph?\u201cI thought about it and I didn\u2019t have much to give. How about this? When I\u2019m a meteoric success in future, you can sell this autograph for a good price. Spend the money however you want\u2026\u201dBefore he could finish, the broom in Luo Wenqiang\u2019s hand was already moving.Not even two hours after returning to school, a large-scale brawl had already broken out in the boys\u2019 dormitory building. It was chaotic and grand. Live-in students from the first to the sixth floors all came to look.Xie Yu kept his distance and watched this lot chase He Zhao from the third floor to the roof, then down again. They made two round-trips.\u201cZhao-ge, stop right there if you\u2019ve got the guts.\u201d\u201cHow shameless are you? Who signs their name\u2014as big as you? Should we frame this and hang it up?\u201dAmidst the crusade, He Zhao said, tone sincere and deserving of a beating, \u201cFrame it. That\u2019s quite a good idea.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dXie Yu was still standing in the doorway of Luo Wenqiang\u2019s room. He leaned against the wall and, as he listened, he couldn\u2019t help looking down and smiling.[]Translation notes: [1] Xie Yu\u2019s exact words are \u2018I\u2019ll give you a \u2018Hur hur\u2019, where \u2018hur hur\u2019 is a laughing phrase (like haha/lol) but is usually used online to mock and jeer or end a conversation.

    "Chapter 17": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fake Slackers108 \u2013 But Old Xie\u2019s mine.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayFake SlackersTranslator: JuryEditor: NomNomFirst Published on Chaleuria\u2014108 \u2013 But Old Xie\u2019s mine.They chased He Zhao until he was forced to stop and take a few hits.The group crowded in the stairwell entrance. Luo Wenqiang had lost a slipper and hopped downstairs on one foot to get it.He Zhao leaned against the railing. While they weren\u2019t looking, he mouthed at his boyfriend, \u2018Save me.\u2019\u201cAre you done making a scene?\u201dXie Yu glanced at the time with a smile, then said, \u201cAre you going to class or not?\u201dOld Tang had told them to return to the classroom to clean up a little and for a meeting. It was probably to distribute new books or to talk about the end-of-term exams.Hearing this, Liu Cunhao let go and glanced down at his wristwatch. \u201cDamn, that\u2019s the time?\u201dHe Zhao walked down the stairs, taking them two at a time. He hooked an arm around Xie Yu\u2019s neck and leaned in close. \u201cDo you have a conscience\u2026 They chased me for so long and you just stood here watching the show.\u201dXie Yu looked at him and leaned close to his ear without any hesitation. \u201cCount your blessings. Actually, I wanted to hit you too.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dA line of people walked out of the school dorms. Green foliage surrounded the road, but it did little to block out the sun.A hot, dry wind rushed up to meet their faces.Only the Year 3 students had supplementary lessons during the school holidays so the other classroom buildings were empty. They weren\u2019t used to how quiet it was.Old Tang started his lecture before they even reached the classroom door, his voice drifting through the window. \u201cI won\u2019t assign you new seats. Go back to your original places. The weather is very hot today. Everybody, please bear with it. Let\u2019s try to finish our first round of revision early so you all can have a few more days of vacation.\u201dAbout half of class 3 had arrived and were cleaning the classroom.Xie Yu got to the door and glanced inside the classroom, then at the sign by the door.Year 3, Class 3.Classroom cleaning duties had been divvied up so there wasn\u2019t much left for Xie Yu to do by the time he entered. In the end, he and He Zhao each took half the blackboard. \u201cThis half is mine. You scram over to that side.\u201dEven though the division of work was clear, Xie Yu came back after washing his cloth and found that his half of the territory had been occupied by He Zhao.\u201cSnatching my territory?\u201dHe Zhao said, \u201cIn this world the strong prey on the weak.\u201dXie Yu still had water on his hands. He nearly threw the cloth on He Zhao\u2019s head in response.They were both boys, and tall, and squeezed in front of the blackboard, they fumbled around for a little. Xie Yu reached out to grab the cloth in He Zhao\u2019s hand, but He Zhao turned around and looked downward at him. \u201cAll right, I won\u2019t mess around with you any more.\u201dOld Tang had said all he needed to say. He stood by the side, drinking water, and found these two very funny. Then he shook his head and his gaze landed by the window.Xu Qingqing was cleaning the window, but her mind was clearly elsewhere.She rubbed the same section several times and only came back to herself after a while.\u201cI know you all are very interested in your end-of-term exam grades. The rankings have been compiled and our class did quite well this time around, better than expected. Everybody, have confidence in yourselves.\u201dOld Tang got the grade sheet from his office and got ready to go over the exams with them. Before he started going over them, he couldn\u2019t help mentioning something else.All of Class 3 heard Old Tang\u2019s slow words, \u201cThis time, our school took two of the top five places in the city.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe room went silent.Even though these two big bros from their class, who might have hit their heads and broken their brains, had made their name in a single night during the 4-school combined exams, that had only been 4 schools and there was still a great distance from the top-tier schools.Now that the news of \u2018Top 5 in the City\u2019 emerged, they were so shocked their spirits might have left their bodies. For a long time, nobody could say anything.It wasn\u2019t only Class 3 who couldn\u2019t digest the news.The day Old Tang finished recording grades, the office phone didn\u2019t stop ringing for the whole afternoon. Not only did the members of the school administration come over to ask about it, the top-tier schools were all surprised by these two who had massacred their way in to the rankings and wondered what trickery was afoot.Liu Cunhao was the first to recover. He felt around in his pockets for a long time and came up with a 5-yuan bill. He slapped it onto his desk. \u201cI bet the one who ranked higher is Yu-ge.\u201dWan Da said, \u201cI\u2026 I bet on Yu-ge too. Zhao-ge is too volatile. Not a man I can get a hold of at all.\u201dLuo Wenqiang said, \u201cI\u2019ll bet my dignity today. I pick Big Bro Xie, too!\u201dXie Yu initially hadn\u2019t cared at all about the rankings and flipped past two pages of the new study material. But now that he found them already betting, and one-sidedly at that, he found it funny. \u201cWhat\u2019s there to bet on?\u201dThis lot probably just wanted to make it feel ritualistic.He Zhao waited for a long time and no one bet on him. He couldn\u2019t sit still. \u201cAre you all still human? Even if we only say we\u2019re brothers, you should at least make a show of it. You\u2019re not considerate at all.\u201dLiu Cunhao said, \u201cSorry, we don\u2019t want to show anything.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe Zhao got up and walked to the front row, about to bet on himself, but he felt around for a while and couldn\u2019t find any spare change. He bent down and knocked on Wan Da\u2019s desk. \u201cAbout that, can I borrow some change?\u201dBefore Wan Da could refuse, He Zhao continued, \u201cThis is your chance to strike it rich. Think about it carefully. You\u2019ll only get one chance. Lend me ten bucks today and in future I\u2019ll\u2014\u201dWan Da said, \u201cNo! I refuse!\u201dXie Yu smiled and leaned back.But contrary to everybody\u2019s expectations, the \u2018acting suave, made some mischief and lost two points for handwriting\u2019 bad stock whom nobody was willing to bet on actually managed to turn the situation around this time.Old Tag looked down at the grade sheet as he said, \u201cThis time, classmate He Zhao with a total score of 743 ranked second in the city, 2 points short of first place\u2026\u201dWan Da nearly lost his grip on the stack of cash in his hand, and thought, I really did lose the chance to strike it rich.They had witnessed the prowess of the top students from the top-tier schools before. They were quite terrifying and just looking at the released grades would make people shake from fright.The top 5 were only a few points short of each other.Besides, there was still a year until the college exams. Who knew who would be ahead of whom in the next exam.This time, Xie Yu had scored two points less than anticipated in the essay component of his literature paper and ranked third. But the essay component included the grader\u2019s personal viewpoint and biases, so it was normal to get one or two points less or more.After hearing the grades announced, Xie Yu felt a headache coming on. He was foreseeing another section in Erzhong\u2019s school history about them, possibly something about \u2018Suppressing the whole city and creating a radiant legend together.\u2019He didn\u2019t even dare recall the scene in the principal\u2019s office from last time.He Zhao ruffled his hair. \u201cWhat is my little friend thinking about?\u201dXie Yu\u2019s expression was blank. \u201cWhat dumb antics of yours will end up in school history this time.\u201dOld Tang kept nagging. \u201cChildren\u2026\u201d He Zhao listened for a while, then reached for his phone.Just now, his phone had vibrated in his pocket for a long time but he hadn\u2019t looked at it.Xie Yu asked, \u201cWho is it?\u201d\u201cShen Jie,\u201d He Zhao said. \u201cHe asked if you had time later to draw two cards for him.\u201dXie Yu didn\u2019t even think about it. \u201cI don\u2019t have time.\u201dHe Zhao put his phone back under his desk. The screen flickered off, then flickered on again. He glanced down at it and said, \u201c\u2026Can\u2019t I draw them? My luck of the draw is good, too.\u201dFrom the dressup game to the bad boy in the dating game, Xie Yu really couldn\u2019t tell from where He Zhao\u2019s so-called \u2018luck of the draw\u2019 manifested.Clearly his good bro Shen Jie had never witnessed it, either.[Shen Jie]: Zhao-ge, be more self-aware.[He Zhao]: I think my understanding of myself is very clear and accurate.Shen Jie was getting a headache.[Shen Jie]: Don\u2019t say any more! How could you be the same as your Old Xie? He\u2019s the true God Ou.\u00b9 Did you get amnesia? Do you need me to help you awaken your memories?He and He Zhao had known each other for many years. This guy never played cards according to expectations. Even if he originally had good luck, it would be completely frittered away by this guy,Shen Jie was about to offer up his sordid history like bbq on a stick, but before he could form his words he saw the reply:[He Zhao]: But Old Xie\u2019s mine.Shen Jie: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe Zhao sent the text and Shen Jie\u2019s avatar turned grey in a single second, like magic.He didn\u2019t even say goodbye and straight up disappeared.How rude.Old Tang finished talking about the two shocking pieces of news, then started reporting the grades of the other people in class according to the ranking.He had said their class did fairly well in this exam. This was not just consolation. Although they had scored fewer points, the difficulty of this exam was higher and, on the whole, they had improved.Usually, after Xue Xisheng\u2019s name was announced their Qing-ge\u2019s name would be right after. Who could have expected that Xu Qingqing\u2019s grades had dropped her class ranking by several places?\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d He Zhao said quietly. \u201cQing-ge didn\u2019t do well?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dXie Yu glanced over and only saw Xu Qingqing\u2019s straight-backed silhouette and the braid at the back of her head.They had initially worried that Xu Qingqing would feel bad, but she didn\u2019t act any differently the whole class period and continued to listen to the lesson as she should. After studying her for a while, Liu Cunhao let down his guard after class ended. He slapped Wan Da\u2019s shoulder and said, \u201cLook, our Qing-ge is our Qing-ge. A man\u2014\u201dBefore Liu Cunhao finished speaking, Xu Qingqing\u2019s initially straight back suddenly curved over and she buried her face in the crook of her elbow.\u201c\u2026You\u2014you\u2019re crying?\u201dXu Qingqing crying left everyone around her helpless.Xu Jing lightly patted her back and said, over and over, \u201cIt\u2019s fine. It\u2019s just an exam.\u201dHe Zhao dragged Xie Yu over to Class 8 to draw the cards, then went back to class. This was the scene they saw: Xu Qingqing sitting, red-eyed, and Liu Cunhao and the others standing in a line in front of her, taking turns. \u201cI\u2019ll tell a joke. There was a little penguin\u2026\u201dFor many people, the pressure brought on by Year 3 was hard to accept immediately.Cruel competition, uncertainty about the future, and the hopes of their family\u2026Anyone could see what had happened here.Through the window, He Zhao joined the group too. He said loudly, \u201cQing-ge! I\u2019ll do a miraculous magic trick for you.\u201dThis guy\u2019s crappy magic\u2014who knew where he had learned it from\u2014needed someone to work with him, so Xie Yu took the temporary position of magician\u2019s assistant.In the end, He Zhao lost the plot with his first line. He pointed at his assistant and said, \u201cI\u2019ll introduce you. This is my shill.\u201dXie Yu said, \u201c\u2026Do you actually know how to do this or not?\u201dXu Qingqing: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dXu Qingqing was speechless, but she also felt her eyes prickle and quietly blinked. \u201cAre you sick? Go, get lost. Go cool off.\u201dThis lot of boys was really clumsy beyond belief. They had no idea how to console people at all and each of their plans was more bizarre than the last.But, for some reason, she felt a little better.[]Translation notes: [1] God Ou: netspeak for someone with very good luck.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 18": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fake Slackers109 \u2013 Your futures contain endless possibilities.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayFake SlackersTranslator: JuryEditor: NomNomFirst Published on Chaleuria\u2014109 \u2013 Your futures contain endless possibilities.\u201cQing-ge, give me another chance?\u201dXu Qingqing pretended to be angry and slammed the pen gripped tightly in her hand onto the table. She got halfway through her act, then couldn\u2019t help smiling. \u201cGive you and your shill another chance?\u201dLiu Cunhao laughed until he plopped to the ground and pounded the floor with his fists.He Zhao: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dXie Yu found it embarrassing. He picked up He Zhao by the collar and dragged him straight back to the back row.Although they had botched it, Xu Qingqing did seem to be in a better mood. When Xu Jing handed snacks over, she even ate a few bites. For a moment, Xie Yu even thought: Maybe it was real magic.This person\u2026He influenced the atmosphere easily. Messy, noisy, with too much sound. Sometimes Xie Yu was so annoyed he wanted to kick him, but he also couldn\u2019t help wanting to draw closer.At this thought, Xie Yu turned and looked at him.After returning to his seat, He Zhao had quieted down. He had unwrapped a lollipop and tossed it into his mouth. When he wasn\u2019t talking, he subconsciously let out a serious air belying his age. Even though the act of holding a lollipop in his mouth was languid and a little rascally.\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201dHe Zhao saw that Xu Qingqing had regained her strength and was standing up to punch Liu Cunhao. Only then did he look away and discover that his little friend by his side had been staring at him for a long time.He lifted a hand and took hold of the plastic stick, then said, \u201cDo you want this? Call me ge and I\u2019ll give it to you.\u201dXie Yu didn\u2019t want the sweet at all, but in that split second he seemed to have fallen under a spell and obediently called him \u2018ge.\u2019Liu Cunhao had summoned his strength intending to bring forth all Xu Qingqing\u2019s spiritedness, but he had overdone his provocation and nearly suffered a terrible backlash. He had provoked Xu Qingqing so much that she chased him out of the classroom and they had a stand-off in the corridor.Xu Qingqing rolled up her sleeves. \u201cHao-zi, you get over here.\u201dLiu Cunhao said, \u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d and ran toward the classroom\u2019s rear door. His gaze swept over the last row and landed on the lollipop in his Yu-ge\u2019s mouth.He was preoccupied with dodging and his mind spun for a long time before it clicked.\u2026That lollipop was in Zhao-ge\u2019s mouth just now though?They called them supplementary lessons, but it was the same as if school had started again.They didn\u2019t cover the new Year 3 textbooks yet, and when they covered new content in class they also reviewed previous content. The classes moved at a quick pace and it was only when the last period had nearly ended that they could furtively relax.Xue Yu was doing several new practice questions Old Wu had set for him. He got halfway, then discovered that his thought process wasn\u2019t quite right. He was about to strike it through when the student in front of him reached back and tossed a note onto his desk without a word.Xie Yu lifted his eyebrows and unfolded the note. The first line was eye-catching: Let\u2019s discuss what to eat for dinner. Please vote. We\u2019ll eat at whichever place has the most votes.Below it was a list of shop names. Peking U, Gold List, Valedictorian House.Someone full of inspiration had even written a campaign speech. The loyal Valedictorian House protector had written flowing praise about it. Their food is really good. When I can\u2019t find a way forward, when my soul sinks into confusion, the Valedictorian House\u2019s food will always wake me up\u2026Xie Yu said, \u201cAre they sick?\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re even campaigning?\u201d He Zhao exclaimed as he looked at it. \u201cThey\u2019re being too sincere. This friend has actually moved me.\u201dHe Zhao ticked off his choice, then wadded up the paper again and tossed it at the next column of students.Wu Zheng finished explaining a question and was about to assign homework for evening self-study. When he looked up, he saw the activity on the classroom floor. \u201cWhat are you passing? Pass it over here for me to see.\u201dThe student in the next column held on to the note and wouldn\u2019t turn it in, but Wu Zheng stepped off the podium and started a 3-minute snatch-fight with him. After getting the note and seeing its contents, he wasn\u2019t sure whether to laugh or cry. \u201cI say, all of you aren\u2019t paying attention to class and coming up with\u2014what is this\u2014is the food at the Valedictorian House really so good?\u201dIn the end, they really went to the Valedictorian House for a meal. They split into two tables and ordered several dishes.The restaurant really gave many types of discounts for all kinds of wondrous reasons. When they settled the bill, the lady boss gave them a \u201820 percent vacation supplementary lesson special discount.\u2019The sky gradually grew dark.The temperature plummeted and it was no longer as stuffy and hot as it had been during the daytime. He Zhao walked at the very end of the line. When he touched his little friend\u2019s hand he felt that his little friend\u2019s fingertips were a little cool.Xie Yu froze for a moment. The noise by his ear continued; Luo Wenqiang and the others were still discussing the food from the Valedictorian House. In his palm, warmth passed from his boyfriend\u2019s body to his.He Zhao made a shushing gesture at him and said, \u201cI\u2019ll just hold your hand for a while.\u201dXie Yu didn\u2019t say anything. His fingers curved upwards and he grasped He Zhao\u2019s hand back.The street was very long. Liu Cunhao and the others walked in front. As Wan Da walked, he jumped up to pluck leaves from the tree. Suddenly, he said, \u201cI want to go to Fudan!\u201dSomeone laughed, \u201cDid you get drunk just from eating rice?\u201dJeering was jeering, but this lot had too much free time after the meal. He hooked an arm around Wan Da\u2019s shoulders and said, \u201cI recommend that you turn left. See that shop? There\u2019s no Fudan here, but you can get a cup of Fudan milk tea.\u201dHe Zhao\u2019s hand tightened around his. \u201cHave you thought about it? Where are you planning to go?\u201dWhich school to go to.Everybody was asking that question. That morning, Old Tang had pulled him over to hear his thoughts, too. After all, with his and He Zhao\u2019s grades, as long as they wanted to get in, they could get in anywhere.\u201cI\u2019m not worried about anything else. Just on the topic of what you want to study, you have to have some ideas.\u201d Old Tang finished his lecture, then asked, \u201cIs there a concentration you\u2019re interested in?\u201dWhile preparing for the exams, everyone learned the same things. Just those few subjects. But university was different. There were all kinds of concentrations and Tang Sen hoped they would step out of the framework and think carefully about this issue.What he was interested in.\u2026\u2026Xie Yu thought for a long time and the scene that eventually surfaced in his mind was that of Madam Gu after she fainted. That day, he had been completely distraught and fumbled around not knowing what to do. His heart suddenly skipped a few beats.Xie Yu recovered and said uncertainly, \u201cAh, I\u2019m still considering it. What about you?\u201dThe whole school was empty and leaves rustled in the wind.\u201cI want to be closer to you.\u201dHe Zhao repeated, \u201cAs long as I\u2019m close to you, that\u2019ll do.\u201dIn the end, the planned evening self-study session did not happen. Old Tang had heard from somewhere that Xu Qingqing had cried after class and wanted to counsel them to not be too anxious.In the end, he just secretly gave them a vacation.Xie Yu had just gotten a change of clothes and headed for the shower. After he took off his shirt, someone knocked on the bathroom door. \u201cOld Tang messaged the group chat and said to go to the quad.\u201dXie Yu\u2019s hand still rested at his waist, poised to take off his pants. \u201cThe quad?\u201d\u201cThe thoughts of a middle-aged man\u2026 I don\u2019t understand them.\u201dNot only He Zhao, the rest of Class 3 also didn\u2019t quite understand it either.[Liu Cunhao]: The quad?[Wan Da]: Don\u2019t tell me we\u2019re going to run?[Luo Wenqiang]: Ah! The quad! We\u2019re going to run!He Zhao paused. Hearing no running water from the doorway, he pulled open the door. \u201cAre you showering or not\u2026\u201dXie Yu had just put his T-shirt back on.Who knew how they would need to suffer on the quad. It would be too troublesome to come back and have to shower again.The hem of his shirt caught just beneath his ribs. He reached out to pull on it but touched He Zhao\u2019s hand instead.This guy\u2019s hand moved, as if accidentally, along the bare line of Xie Yu\u2019s back.Xie Yu was about to say, \u2018Don\u2019t goddamn let your hands wander,\u2019 but the person behind him collected himself and helped him get his clothes in order, then lowered his head and kissed his neck. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dHe Zhao was about to let him off, but this time Xie Yu got ideas. He turned around and leaned against the side of the sink, watching him. \u201cKiss me?\u201dThey were the last to arrive. By the time they got there Luo Wenqiang was already leading everyone else in warm-up exercises.Class 3\u2019s gym rep was very excited. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s warm up! I think we\u2019re definitely going on a night run! Old Tang is fashionable!\u201dXie Yu prepared to do a 1000m run, but in the end Old Tang made them line up and commanded, \u201cLet\u2019s take a walk.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dLuo Wenqiang was thinking of flying freely on the running track. When he heard the words \u2018take a walk,\u2019 he was confused. \u201cSir, this is\u2026?\u201dOld Tang was in a joyous mood, too. He put his hands behind his back and said, \u201cI\u2019m taking you on a stroll.\u201dLuo Wenqiang had completely lost his ability to think.After Old Tang had gone back, he was still worried about them. So the middle-aged man racked his brains and thought about it backwards and forwards, and had picked an inconceivable way of helping them relieve stress that didn\u2019t suit young people at all.The boys and the girls each formed a line, and the two lines of students walked around the quad once.As Xie Yu walked, he was mulling over which way to escape back to the dorm later. He Zhao glanced at him and immediately knew what he was calculating. He reminded in a whisper, \u201cGive the middle-aged man some face. We\u2019ll see. Anyway, he\u2019ll make us walk two rounds at most.\u201d\u201c\u2026Who\u2019s not giving the middle-aged man face, here?\u201dOld Tang really didn\u2019t lead them on the walk for very long. Less than two rounds later, he was tired and sat on the track to talk with them.The sky grew thoroughly dark.The wind that rushed up to meet their faces was slightly cool.Perhaps they were influenced by the night scene or couldn\u2019t clearly see each other\u2019s expressions. The feelings which everybody wanted to say, but usually pressed down and didn\u2019t dare to reveal, now bubbled up.They were far from the top, even in a dangerously low position. Facing the college exams and facing the city rankings from where they were, it would be a lie to say that they weren\u2019t panicking.Old Tang sighed lightly. \u201cMaybe some of you think that you didn\u2019t do well this time. That\u2019s not true. If you didn\u2019t try hard, that\u2019s one thing, but there\u2019s no such thing as not doing well. I think you all are very good and you can be even better.\u201dXu Qingqing had initially already dealt with her feelings, but for some reason they all rushed up again and she started crying again, pathetically.But it wasn\u2019t out of sadness. She felt as if someone was tousling her head after she had fallen down.\u201cAnd someone told me that they felt confused about the future and uncertain,\u201d Old Tang said. \u201cThat\u2019s not confusion\u2026 silly kids, your futures contain endless possibilities.\u201dFor a moment, no one said anything.Around them, only several rows of streetlights outside the quad\u2019s chain-link fence were lit. The light from the roadside shone, gentle and slow.Xie Yu braced himself on the rubber track and someone tugged at the hem of his shirt.He Zhao lay down directly on the track, one hand pillowed behind his head. He didn\u2019t say anything, only pointed with his chin indicating for Xie Yu to look up.Xie Yu followed his gaze and raised his head.He saw the sky full of stars.Points and pinpricks, radiating light, scattered across this piece of the night sky.[]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

With confidence and assurance, she yelled, \u201cFight on!\u201dOne after another, the people around her stacked their hands on top of hers.Palms against the backs of hands.Wan Da said, \u201cThat\u2019s my Qing-ge! Tough!\u201dLiu Cunhao said, \u201cFight, fight, fight!\u201dHe Zhao sat up and reached out to join in the fun. \u201cFight on.\u201dXie Yu was the last. He didn\u2019t say anything as he put his hand on the back of He Zhao\u2019s.His fingers were slender and long, with prominent joints.He Zhao couldn\u2019t help staring at them for a while, then he looked up at Xie Yu.The two locked eyes for several seconds. For a moment they both imagined they saw themselves from Year 1, when they had just joined this school. At the time, He Zhao always had a cigarette in hand, his reputation disorderly and his expression full of disdain. He had caused a lot of trouble.And Xie Yu, as the Big Bro of the West\u2014even fewer people dared provoke him.Who would have known that so many things would happen after that?It was pure coincidence that he had joined Erzhong and he had had no hopes\u2026 but, in Old Tang\u2019s words, there were \u2018endless possibilities.\u2019 Like a miracle, a possibility had linked them together.There would still be, in the future.There would still be even more miracles.Who knew which of them started smiling first. Then Xie Yu looked away. He couldn\u2019t help the corner of his mouth lifting in a smile, too.Liu Cunhao and the others had started learning from He Zhao and began to brag. \u201cI\u2026 my future is limitless.\u201d\u201cI\u2026 will definitely become someone who does great things. When that time comes, I\u2019ll give you each an autograph, too. When I make a name for myself, then\u2014\u201d\u201cSign it bigger. An A4 piece of paper is too small and you can\u2019t express yourself properly.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter they bragged for a long time, the noise level died down again.One after the other, everybody lay down on the track. They lay down in several groups, bodies facing all directions. They spread their arms out to the wind blowing over them and shut their eyes.They had intended to shut their eyes to relax, but, after a short while, many of them had fallen asleep. Luo Wenqiang had even started snoring.The snores were accompanied by the faint sound of insects chirping.Xie Yu half-opened his eyes again and glanced at the night sky.In his mind, there weren\u2019t any other thoughts\u2026 he just thought it was very bright.After taking a walk and having a heart-to-heart talk with a middle-aged man, the atmosphere of Class 3 had relaxed some.Facing half a summer vacation\u2019s worth of intensive studying, each of them adopted a very proper attitude. They got used to their status as \u2018Year 3 exam takers\u2019 and rushed to complete the first round of revision before the vacation ended.Conversely, on the day school formally started again, they didn\u2019t feel a sense of novelty for the \u2018new school term.\u2019A big batch of new Year 1 students had joined the school. The school broadcast welcomed them for a long time. The new students were confused, and just having joined the school, they were curious about everything.The other school buildings also regained their former energy and were noisy all the time.Their school building was indeed for Year 3 students only. No matter how noisy it was outside, it never caught up to them. But, occasionally, groups of girls would sneak over to look at the two \u2018legendary figures\u2019 of Class 3.Wu Zheng was especially troubled by this. On many occasions, he opened the door to chase them away. \u201cWhich class are you from\u2014\u201dBut every time, before Wu Zheng could finish yelling, they would immediately run downstairs like scared animals.Wu Zheng could only close the door and scold them. \u201cXie Yu, He Zhao, the two of you, fool around a little less. They were from Year 1, right? It hasn\u2019t been long since school started and they\u2019ve already found their way here.\u201dXie Yu had been doing questions when, for no reason, he was accused of \u2018fooling around.\u2019 \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe Zhao was even more incredulous. \u201cAh?\u201dWu Zheng said, \u201cDon\u2019t \u2018ah\u2019 me. Did you solve that question from just now? Come up and do it at the podium.\u201dHe Zhao had been about to say, \u201cWhat\u2019s it got to do with me and Old Xie,\u201d then he thought back to how the girls at the window had pointed in their direction, and had a rare\u2014correct\u2014epiphany. Holding his scratch paper, he stood up and whispered, \u201cI didn\u2019t fool around. There\u2019s only you.\u201dXie Yu smiled and said, \u201cGet lost, you.\u201dThis question wasn\u2019t difficult and He Zhao solved it quickly. But his solution was very novel and Wu Zheng had to watch until he was halfway through before understanding how on earth he had solved it. \u201cClassmate, could you solve the problem according to a normal person\u2019s thought process?\u201dHe Zhao said, \u201cNormal thought process? There\u2019s no fun in the normal process.\u201dWu Zheng said, \u201cYou\u2019re having too much fun. Is one side of the blackboard enough for you to write on?\u201dThe class erupted into laughter.Wu Zheng had learned his lesson. In future, when he called on someone to solve questions, he had better not call this one. He was too wild and uncontrollable.\u201cYu-ge, I didn\u2019t fully understand that question from just now.\u201d After class was dismissed, Wan Da came over carrying his exercise book. \u201cI got to this step, then drew the function diagram. I understand that much, but after that\u2026\u201dThe several homework questions Wu Zheng had left for them at the end were a little difficult. Wan Da had struggled with them for a long time, but in the end he still had not found the solution.Xie Yu took the book and glanced at it. \u201cWhat did you understand? Your diagram is wrong.\u201dWan Da corrected the question in several strokes. When he closed the exercise book, his nosy heart was ignited again. \u201cDo you know that our school is hosting a coming-of-age ceremony next month?\u201dAll the schools in A City held coming-of-age ceremonies the same way.It was a rather formal event and the selected location was far away. All in all, they would be gone for two days and spend one night at a hotel.If they were looking forward to this so-called \u2018ceremony,\u2019 they wanted to go out to play even more.Xie Yu said, \u201cComing-of-age ceremony?\u201dWan Da said hopefully, \u201cI don\u2019t know what it is, either. But, either way, it\u2019s true that we\u2019re going out to play\u2026 and we\u2019re staying over for a night. It just sounds carefree.\u201dThey had just not played enough over the so-called spring and autumn school trips. This time around it was no different from going on holiday.The more Wan Da talked, the more he became immersed in his own fantasies. Xie Yu elbowed He Zhao in the waist. \u201cGe, attending a coming-of-age at your age isn\u2019t fitting, is it.\u201dHe Zhao reached out to hook an arm around his neck, but found only air.\u201c\u2026Get over here. What do you mean by that?\u201d\u201cWas I not clear?\u201d Xie Yu said. \u201cI mean you\u2019re old.\u201dHalfway through Wan Da\u2019s vivid musings he looked up and saw that the two of them were entangled together again.These two would often get handsy for no reason. Out in the open. They had no sense of how they were affecting others at all.But this time the situation was a little different. Their usual roles were reversed and Xie Yu was now the one being chased and beaten.He Zhao was not really going to use force and was only playing with him. He took two steps and couldn\u2019t hold it any more, then stood in the doorway and smiled as he beckoned to Xie Yu. \u201cDon\u2019t run. Come back.\u201dXie Yu stopped and leaned against the window, looking at him.He Zhao said, \u201cI won\u2019t mess with you,\u201d and walked into the corridor. But when he got close, he still caught hold of Xie Yu and wouldn\u2019t let go. \u201cI\u2019m old?\u201dPeople came and went in the corridor.They were both tall and long-legged, clad in uniforms, and just looking at their shadows stacked nearly on top of each other already made people\u2019s imaginations run wild.Wan Da shook his head. He was used to it. He thought, anyway, the reputations of these two have already been wrecked so badly not even dregs are left.The detailed agenda of the coming-of-age ceremony seemed to have grown wings. Within a few class periods it spread throughout the year.There would be three locations: the history museum, a famous person\u2019s former residence, and then a temple fair in the evening.\u201cYou\u2019re all very excited.\u201dOld Tang didn\u2019t want them to be distracted and planned to take some class time several days before the event to talk with them about the coming-of-age ceremony. He endured it with much difficulty until the week before the event, then discovered that, before he could say a word, this lot had already found out about it. \u201cPrepare all the things you want to bring\u2026 at 8 a.m. we\u2019ll board the bus and go to the People\u2019s Memorial Museum first.\u201dThey didn\u2019t know what to prepare, so they followed the pattern of the spring and autumn school trips. Aside from several simple changes of clothes, they brought a big bag of snacks.Before they set off, Liu Cunhao said with a troubled conscience, \u201cI didn\u2019t bring my homework. Am I too much?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s this about bringing homework? Leave your homework in your dorm,\u201d Luo Wenqiang said. \u201cIt\u2019s very responsible. It\u2019ll take good care of itself.\u201dThe weather was hot and the bus was full of the smell of formaldehyde.Xie Yu had just taken off his mask. When he got on the bus and got a whiff of the smell, he put his mask back on.He Zhao adjusted the angle of the air-conditioner over his head so that the cold air was blowing toward Xie Yu. \u201cIs it bad?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a little stuffy.\u201dHe Zhao continued, \u201cGe will lend you his shoulder to lean on.\u201dXie Yu said, \u201cWhat damn use is that?\u201dBut after Xie Yu looked down and sent Madam Gu a text reporting his situation, he still leaned against He Zhao\u2019s shoulder and fell asleep inside the gently rocking bus.He Zhao lifted a hand, his fingers coming to rest lightly by Xie Yu\u2019s ear. He caught hold of the black string behind his ear and undid one side of the mask for him.He couldn\u2019t help staring a few moments longer.Then He Zhao recovered, pulled out his own phone, and sent a text to his own Old He for propriety\u2019s sake.He thought Old He would probably just respond \u2018Got it,\u2019 but after waiting several minutes, he got a different set of words: You\u2019ve grown up.The bus ride would take about two hours. At the beginning, this lot made some noise and yelled about wanting to sing songs.\u201cWhat? No, don\u2019t sing.\u201d He Zhao motioned to them not to make a racket. \u201cMy deskmate is sleeping.\u201dSomeone yelled from the back row, \u201c\u2014Zhao-ge, you\u2019re doting on Yu-ge too much.\u201dAfter this emerged, everyone else began to blindly make noise about it, too.He Zhao had no intention of denying it, but Liu Cunhao, Wan Da, and the others reacted even more strongly than him, the person involved.\u201cOf course good bros must dote on each other,\u201d Liu Cunhao said, throwing an arm around Wan Da\u2019s shoulder. \u201cRight, Da-zi? Do I dote on you?\u201dWan Da grit his teeth. \u201cYes! A lot!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThey were making too much noise and Xie Yu was a light sleeper. He half-opened his eyes and the other side of his mask fell off, too. \u201cDoting on what?\u201d\u201cNothing. Just don\u2019t ask.\u201dHe Zhao said, \u201cThese two seem to have a problem with their brains today.\u201dWhen the Year 3 group reached the People\u2019s Memorial Museum, it was nearly noon. Before beginning the formal tour, Erzhong\u2019s administration had set up a simple ceremony nearby.Old Tang stood at the front of the line.Mad Dog had changed his style and was wearing a sharp suit with leather shoes. Under the burning sun, he didn\u2019t look hot in the least. \u201cWe didn\u2019t bring you on this coming-of-age ceremony to play. Students, you\u2019re 18. You\u2019re adults now.\u201dWhen he said the word \u2018adults,\u2019 the audience quieted down.They thought about the young faces of Erzhong\u2019s new year 1 students, just like theirs when they had first joined the school. Then they thought about how, in the blink of an eye, they were here now.\u201cYou are adults now and must learn something very important. Take responsibility and have a character that is moral and upstanding. Study hard and train hard, and plant both feet firmly on the ground. I feel happy and proud of you, from the bottom of my heart\u2026\u201d\u201cNo matter where you go from here, and how far you go, do not forget\u2014a heart of innocence! That is the motto of Erzhong!\u201d\u201cOur Erzhong spirit!\u201dHalfway through his speech, Mad Dog\u2019s voice paused for a second.Then he turned around and raised a hand to wipe at something. Xie Yu, to the side, clearly saw Dean Jiang wiping away tears. But he was worried he\u2019d be found out, so he then wiped his forehead pretending that he was wiping away sweat.It was a very official and formal speech. The weather was hot and he was burning up under the sun.Nobody around him showed a hint of impatience.Eventually, Dean Jiang showed a rare smile. His voice lowered and, different from his usual imposing severity, he showed a little gentleness. \u201cCongratulations. You\u2019ve come of age.\u201d\u201cWith courage, go off to even further places.\u201d[]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 20": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fake Slackers111 \u2013 I just want you to be safe and happy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayFake SlackersTranslator: JuryEditor: NomNomFirst Published on Chaleuria\u2014111 \u2013 I just want you to be safe and happy.After Dean Jiang gave his speech, several other school administrators went up to take their turn.The sun grew hotter and hotter.\u201cSeems like they\u2019ll give out some things later.\u201d He Zhao was tall and he could see the paper box by Dean Jiang\u2019s side at a glance from where he stood. He said, guessing, \u201cLooks like books?\u201dOther schools gave books at their coming-of-age ceremonies. The gift was simple and brutal: a copy of the Constitution. But looking at the size of the box it probably didn\u2019t contain such thick and heavy books.Old Tang was busy maintaining order. Xie Yu leaned back quietly; he hadn\u2019t clearly heard what He Zhao said.He Zhao bent over. If he lowered his head a little more he would touch the tips of Xie Yu\u2019s ears. He thought about it, then called, \u201cOld Xie.\u201dXie Yu was uncomfortable under the sun and raised a hand to shield his face from the light.\u201cYou\u2019re an adult now, you\u2019ve grown up. There\u2019s one important thing you have to learn.\u201dBehind him, He Zhao\u2019s voice was low, and when He Zhao spoke his breath touched Xie Yu\u2019s ear. His words were very similar to Mad Dog\u2019s from just now and for a moment Xie Yu didn\u2019t realize what exactly he meant. He paused, then asked, \u201cWhat?\u201dHe Zhao said, \u201cTake responsibility.\u201d\u201cMm.\u201dXie Yu\u2019s response was lukewarm. Based on his knowledge of He Zhao, this probably wasn\u2019t anything good.As expected, the moment he said, \u2018Mm,\u2019 He Zhao immediately continued to say, \u201cFor example, take responsibility for your boyfriend.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dSo this was his goddamn ruse.\u201cTake responsibility my\u2013\u201d Xie Yu got halfway through his curse and didn\u2019t continue. He cut straight to the point. \u201cIf you have something to say, why don\u2019t you just say it? What\u2019s the point of beating around the bush?\u201dHe Zhao had just wanted to tease him. Hearing this, he smiled and bent his head, putting his forehead to the crook of Xie Yu\u2019s neck.At this time, the last leader had finished speaking on stage.Looking at the time, it was about time to go into the memorial for the tour. But all the homeroom teachers were gathered by the box doing who knows what. About five minutes later, each of them carried a stack of things back.\u2014It was a thick bundle of envelopes.Old Tang had not told them about this part beforehand. When Xie Yu received the letter, he was stunned for a moment.On the envelope was written \u2018Xie Yu.\u2019The handwriting was proper and beautiful, and very familiar. At a glance he could tell it was Madam Gu\u2019s handwriting.\u201cWhere\u2019s yours?\u201d Xie Yu glanced backward. On the envelope in He Zhao\u2019s hands, right under the big words \u2018He Zhao\u2019 was another messy line: I\u2019m your pa.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe Zhao saw it, too. He coughed lightly and said, \u201cThat\u2019s my Old He. He\u2019s a character.\u201dBefore, in the office, he had heard Old Tang phone He Zhao\u2019s dad. Xie Yu thought that he had a good understanding of this \u2018Old He,\u2019 but this went far beyond what he had imagined. \u201cHe is quite the character.\u201dAs they spoke, ambient music began playing from the speakers to the side. The song \u2018A Grateful Heart\u2019\u00b9 flowed out alongside the sound of static.The students who had received letters were all in a state of confusion and talked quietly amongst themselves:\u201cWhat is this?\u201d\u201cMy dad wrote to me?\u201d\u201cMy mom?\u201dLiu Cunhao, as the class rep, stood at the head of the line and led the group.\u201cWhat is this?\u201d He opened the letter and read out the first line. \u201cTo my dearest son\u2026\u201dInitially, his voice held a joking tone.But after reading out these words, he suddenly went quiet.Old Tang distributed the last letter, then stood by Dean Jiang\u2019s side and said, \u201cHow did you think of this?\u201dDean Jiang usually looked cruel and heartless, but even though his words were harsh, sometimes his thoughts were even more meticulous than those of Tang Sen, the literature teacher. He had planned the coming-of-age ceremony from very early on. He had wanted to make it special and do his best to let this group of kids remember this day.Dean Jiang sighed. \u201cSome things are hard to talk about in the day-to-day. Maybe through a letter, their parents can\u2026 communicate with them more.\u201dXie Yu opened the envelope and found that Madam Gu had filled three sheets of paper.The opening line was, \u2018I love you.\u2019For a moment, through the thin sheets of paper, Xie Yu seemed to see Madam Gu holding a pen and sitting at a desk, writing.\u2014I love you, but sometimes love is a burden too.I am also very grateful to you. I\u2019m grateful that you came to be by my side.Xie Yu\u2019s hands tightened on the paper. He couldn\u2019t explain it, but he felt as if someone had gently squeezed his heart.Several girls from the next class over couldn\u2019t keep their feelings in check and started sobbing out loud. They held their hands over their mouths and the muffled sounds of crying emanated from between their fingers.As these girls had started crying, the atmosphere grew even more emotional.Sometimes the most genuine, strongest thought in one\u2019s heart is also the thought which one is most embarrassed to say.Xie Yu read two sheets, then looked up. He stared at a nearby tree for a while, then recovered and read the last sheet one word and one line at a time.Since you were very young, I couldn\u2019t help thinking about your future. I thought about what you might be like when you grow up, where you would go, and what you would do. 360 professions.\u00b2 I thought about all of them.Now, you should think for yourself.No matter what you choose, I feel proud of you.I just want you to be safe and happy.\u201cThe Liyang Erzhong coming-of-age ceremony ends here.\u201d Dean Jiang took the microphone, then continued to say a few concluding words. \u201cI hope that no matter what difficulties you meet in future, you will remember this day. All your feelings, your courage, and your first heart.\u201d\u201cNow, each class please follow your teacher and proceed in order into the museum for the tour\u2026\u201dThe tour of the People\u2019s Memorial Museum was very quiet. Maybe they had not yet recovered from the ceremony just now or, perhaps, facing the heavy weight of history, they were unable to speak. They took the tour according to the given path and emerged. By this time, it was nearly 3 in the afternoon.Only when they got on the bus to go to the restaurant reserved for dinner did they grow energetic again.He Zhao said loudly, \u201cI\u2019ll make myself clear now. Later, I refuse to sit at the same table with the gym rep.\u201dEight to a table, they basically needed to fight in order to eat.After He Zhao\u2019s proclamation, Liu Cunhao immediately raised his hand. \u201cI refuse, too.\u201dLuo Wenqiang was kicked back and forth like a rubber ball. The way things were progressing, he would have to make up a table with Old Tang and the others. \u201cHao-zi, you don\u2019t dote on me any more? Where\u2019s the mutual doting we talked about?!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe Zhao took the lead and livened the atmosphere, then fell silent after that. With one hand stuck in his pocket, he leaned his head back and shut his eyes.Even though it was pitch-dark in front of his eyes, the words from Old He\u2019s letter still surfaced little by little.\u2014I was also worried that when you fell down, you got hurt.\u2014But more than that, I believed in you. How could my son give up over such a small difficulty?In He Zhao\u2019s recollection, Old He was a very cool parent. Before, he might have thought that Old He\u2019s method of education was quite inhumane. If He Zhao fell, Old He would never reach out to help him up. \u201cIf you have the guts, lie down on the floor for the rest of your life. If you don\u2019t, then get up.\u201dHe Zhao thought this far, then faintly felt something move at his side. When he opened his eyes, his little friend beside him had already inappropriately stuck his fingertips a little way into his pocket.He Zhao said nothing. He leaned against the back of the seat and stared at his little friend.Xie Yu didn\u2019t dodge, either, and directly grasped He Zhao\u2019s hand.Luo Wenqiang and the others\u2019 conversation had drifted from dinner to the hotel. \u201cWhen I get back later, I\u2019ll do some homework\u2026\u201d\u201cYou brought homework? Are you an animal? Didn\u2019t you say it could take good care of itself?!\u201d\u201cI was consoling you. You can\u2019t believe consoling words, can you?\u201dThe restaurant\u2019s food wasn\u2019t very good. Plastic tablecloths were laid over big wooden tables, and there were about a dozen tables in the hall. Many classes were squeezed in together and dinner tasted like the food that came out of the big pots in the cafeteria.Luo Wenqiang still sat at their table, making everyone nervous.He Zhao was worried Xie Yu would let him off and reminded him, \u201cLater, use your chopsticks to snatch food, or not even the dregs will be left for you.\u201dXie Yu split his chopsticks apart. He wasn\u2019t concerned at all. \u201cHe can try.\u201dAll the people who sat at a table with Luo Wenqiang sat with their backs straight, standing by as if what awaited them was not a big meal but a battle.Wan Da sat next to Luo Wenqiang. He felt that today\u2019s meal could definitely go down in history. While the other tables quietly ate and complained from time to time that the food wasn\u2019t to their taste, there was pandemonium at their table.He Zhao tossed away his chopsticks. \u201cDamn, Hao-zi, hold him down. Don\u2019t give him the chance to take food\u2014\u201d\u201cWan Da, don\u2019t eat any more. Help out,\u201d Liu Cunhao said. \u201cAttack his weak point!\u201dWan Da was confused. \u201cWeak point? What weak point?\u201dXie Yu said, \u201cTake his chopsticks.\u201dLuo Wenqiang was attacked from all sides. Someone held him down, pressing his face to the table. \u201cWhy are you doing this to me?\u201dThe people at the next table over were dumbstruck. \u201cIs this even still a meal? They\u2019re being so ferocious.\u201dThe group of them fought together and managed to protect half a plate of baked fish in the center of the table.Instead of intricate dishes and exotic delicacies, this meal of cafeteria food-that-came-from-a-pot where the cook\u2019s hand had slipped and added a few more spoonfuls of salt was more comparable to the scene of a traffic accident.What nobody knew was that they wouldn\u2019t forget the taste for many years to come.The agenda for the two days was quite packed. After eating, they cleaned up slightly and set off for the temple fair.It wasn\u2019t as stuffy and hot as that afternoon. When they got off the bus, several gusts of cool wind even blew over from the lake.South Temple was a unique tourist spot. As evening fell, more and more crowds gathered.On the street, hawkers sold accessories out of push carts. There were red embroidery, tassels hanging from the bottom, delicate and intricate.And there were old folks who set up stalls selling river lanterns. Bent over, they sat by the lake, feet on the stone stairs.The culture and people here were different from A City. It looked a little old-fashioned.Old Tang was worried about them. There were many people here, and night was about to fall fully. He asked them several times if they had brought their phones with them. \u201c\u2026All right, are you sure you have them? Then, everybody, split into groups and do what you want. At 7 p.m. we\u2019ll gather back at the entrance.\u201dAs Xie Yu listened, someone suddenly slapped his back.He Zhao was behind him and mouthed, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cWhere?\u201d\u201cAnywhere,\u201d He Zhao said. \u201cOr do you want to stay here and group up?\u201dXie Yu remembered the autumn school trip and thought, Forget it. It\u2019s annoying with too many people.After Old Tang mentioned splitting into groups, Liu Cunhao subconsciously turned to look for the two school tyrants and happened to catch sight of their departing silhouettes.Both of them were wearing school uniforms and made a compatible match when they stood side by side. Before walking very far, He Zhao reached out with no hesitation and took Xie Yu\u2019s hand.[]The next chapter of FS is the final chapter.

He didn\u2019t dodge or hesitate.The sky gradually grew darker.All they could see was red. The ground was covered with remaining fragments of the fireworks, and lanterns filled the street, glimmering.They walked side by side for a while. On the way, they passed a stall selling sweets. He Zhao looked twice, his hand tightening as he pulled Xie Yu towards the stall. \u201cShall ge buy some sweets for you?\u201dSome female tourists surrounded the stand.The syrup was orange-yellow and translucent, glistening under the light from the streetlamps behind them. The shopkeeper was an old hand at this and in two or three strokes he drew a dragon with fangs bared and brandishing its claws.Cheers rose from the crowd.\u201cHow childish.\u201d Xie Yu didn\u2019t want to squeeze into the line. \u201cHow old are you?\u201dHe Zhao lifted a hand and pointed at one of the sweets. He said loudly, \u201cSir, this one.\u201dHe Zhao used to carry lollipops with him to help him quit smoking. Then he got used to it. Even though he no longer ate them often, when he went to the convenience store at school he would get two and put them in the pocket of his uniform, just in case.After he had grown friendlier with the class, Xu Qingqing and the others got braver and would occasionally come over to ask for sweets. \u201cZhao-ge, do you still have sweets?\u201dAt the time, He Zhao had been \u2018mired in video games\u2019 and unable to extricate himself. He still firmly held the position of \u2018bottom-of-the-year student\u2019 whom no one could budge no matter how badly they did in the exams. He held onto his phone and didn\u2019t bother with them. \u201cWait a while. I\u2019m at an important part.\u201dXie Yu had just woken up. Still lying on his side, he reached for He Zhao\u2019s pocket.Xu Qingqing had frozen for a moment. When she came back to herself, she raised a hand to indicate, \u201cI want the strawberry one!\u201dXie Yu said, somewhat impatiently, \u2018Mm.\u2019He Zhao\u2019s game had ended quickly, but he had situational awareness and pretended he hadn\u2019t yet finished.\u2026\u2026After reminiscing this far, Xie Yu looked down at the sweet in his hand, thought for a while, then bent down and tasted it.It was cloyingly sweet.The two of them were very close and the picture drawn in cane sugar was about half a palm\u2019s width long.He Zhao bent down and bit down on the other side.Several old-fashioned, resonant chimes rang out from a distance.The moment the bells sounded, the lights on both sides of the street lit up again.All along the path they had taken here, extending forward. The whole temple festival was thoroughly illuminated by the lanterns\u2019 light.They left the area and walked a little further to the shopping street.Xie Yu wanted to bring something back for Madam Gu. He picked a shop, but didn\u2019t find anything after looking through things for a while. There were many varieties of scarves on the wall, but ones that suited Madam Gu were few and far in between.He Zhao, on the other hand, picked something. \u201cWhat about this one? Old He should be very happy with this. Straightforward, but not simple. Classic, but fashionable.\u201dNext to him, Xie Yu was getting a headache listening to him.He Zhao was holding a plain mug, the old-fashionedness of it practically about to come off the cup and stick to his face. It was a classic design from the \u201880s in the classic color combination of blue, green, and red. On the mug were six large words: Dad, it\u2019s been hard on you.Xie Yu said, \u201cAre you serious?\u201dHe Zhao said, \u201cDo I look like I\u2019m the casual kind?\u201d\u201cGe, you\u2019re very impressive.\u201dXie Yu glanced over the other things on the shelves and said sincerely, \u201cReally, you\u2019re very impressive. Among so many things, you picked out the ugliest one at a glance.\u201dHe Zhao: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dXie Yu remembered He Zhao\u2019s personality and that of his father were cut from the same mold, and thought that maybe the son had also inherited his father\u2019s gift-giving strategies. He probed, \u201cWhat does your dad give you for gifts?\u201dHe Zhao put the mug back, thought about it, began to say something, then stopped again. \u201cAbout that\u2026 I can\u2019t explain it in a few words.\u201dXie Yu raised his eyebrows.He Zhao said, \u201cHold on. I\u2019ll look for it.\u201dXie Yu watched He Zhao pull out his phone and go through it for a long time, then He Zhao stuffed one side of a pair of earphones into his ear.It didn\u2019t go in properly and Xie Yu lifted a hand to hold it in place.On the phone screen was He Zhao\u2019s WeChat conversation with his dad. Looking at the message history, it was from He Zhao\u2019s birthday from last year.[Old He]: Son, happy birthday.[Old He]: [Video]In the video were a dozen or so children from Africa, wearing brightly colored clothes. The children in front raised a blackboard in their hands. Three lines were written in chalk on the blackboard: He Zhao, happy birthday! Wishing you health and success in all you do. Dad loves you forever!Love you!The child in the lead shouted this, then the group of children echoed it. After the cheer, they also included a short dance.This was both a visual and auditory assault.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dXie Yu, caught unawares, was shocked by this video and couldn\u2019t say anything for a long time.Before he could come up with the words, he heard He Zhao say, \u201cAt the time I was actually quite touched.\u201dXie Yu considered what to say and found that nothing he could say could express his current feelings. Eventually, he took the tea mug of worrying taste and stuffed it in He Zhao\u2019s hands. He was thoroughly resigned, in word and in spirit. \u201cYour family\u2019s genetic material is really outstanding.\u201dThey ran into Xu Qingqing and the others on the shopping street. It was nearly time to regroup, so the group of them walked toward the meeting spot.He Zhao said, \u201cQing-ge, you bought a hammer?\u201dXu Qingqing raised the massage stick in her hand and waved it in front of him. \u201cThis is not a hammer! I think I\u2019ve been studying too hard and need a massage\u2026\u201dHe Zhao smiled and took it to play with. All the way, when he had nothing to do, he rapped Xie Yu\u2019s back with it.He rapped so much Xie Yu got impatient and nearly did violence to him in public.\u201cIs everyone here?\u201d Liu Cunhao stood at the front of the line and looked around. \u201cDon\u2019t move about. Let me count\u2026\u201dLiu Cunhao finished counting and found they were two people short.Luo Wenqiang got in contact with them, then hung up the phone and said, \u201cThey\u2019re on the way. Let\u2019s wait a bit. The fireworks will go off in a while, anyway.\u201dThe evening fireworks show lasted about ten minutes. The fireworks rose up from the surface of the lake.The meeting place happened to be by the lake. When Old Tang arrived, he saw Xie Yu and He Zhao sitting on the railing. They were very gutsy\u2014their hands were braced on the side of the railing, both feet hovering off the ground as they leaned forward.The wind rushed up to meet their faces.\u201cWa-ah, it\u2019s pretty.\u201d The others braced themselves against the railing. Unable to stop themselves, they also leaned over it.Perhaps it was the light from the fireworks, but each of this group of kids had stars sparkling in their eyes.\u201cGoing out at night is forbidden. Don\u2019t keep thinking about your rich night lives. Stay quietly in your rooms and rest. If you\u2019re caught, you\u2019ll get demerit points right away.\u201d On the way back, Old Tang was worried and kept reminding them of this. \u201cDo you all understand?\u201dSeveral people called out, \u201cWe don\u2019t need to go out to have rich night lives. We have six people, short one person for Monopoly. Does anyone want to play? Room 3009. We\u2019ll wait for our fated person.\u201d\u201cOver here. Murderer, pro league.\u201d\u201cMe!\u201d\u201cCount me in!\u201dThey automatically ignored Xie Yu, whose luck was so good he had no friends, and shouted, \u201cZhao-ge, are you coming? We\u2019ll wait for you in 3009.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not going.\u201d He Zhao smiled and said, \u201cI\u2019ll play something else with Old Xie.\u201dDue to the headcount, Erzhong had made reservations across three hotels. The one they were assigned was closest to the city center and the amenities around were better, too.They indeed didn\u2019t need to go out to have rich night lives.Xie Yu took a simple shower, and when he pulled open the door to go out, He Zhao trapped him in the doorway of the bathroom.He Zhao had one arm braced against the wall. With his other hand, he leisurely undid the buttons on his shirt, starting from the third button and moving downward. \u201cAbout that, do you want to play with something else? For instance, me.\u201dThis guy really would die if he didn\u2019t flirt for a day.Xie Yu didn\u2019t say anything. He moved forward a little, letting the water in his hair continue to drip, and placed a kiss on his protruding Adam\u2019s apple. Then he opened his mouth and bit down, neither hard nor lightly.This was a sensitive spot and He Zhao couldn\u2019t help letting out a hiss.He Zhao thought: his little friend was always like this. He looked calm and indifferent, but his ability to flirt back was first-rate.After Xie Yu had teased him this way, the situation was unsalvageable.By the time Xie Yu reacted, the clothes he had put on not too long ago had nearly all been removed.Xie Yu had his back to the headboard in a half-sitting position. His fingers had been lightly threaded through He Zhao\u2019s hair, but as He Zhao serviced his lower body, his fingers curved and he couldn\u2019t help tugging a little harder.Worried that the soundproofing in the hotel was not good, Xie Yu buried half his face in the crook of He Zhao\u2019s neck and didn\u2019t dare make a sound.Then he raised his hand, about to cover his mouth, but reflexively bit down on the joints of his fingers.On his slender, long fingers was a row of extremely suggestive bite marks, but his voice still slipped out, a muted groan. Eventually, when he was roughly treated, his voice trailed off, but was still harsh. \u201cYou goddamn\u2026 fuck.\u201d\u201cStop biting.\u201dHe Zhao bent down and kissed the joints of his fingers, then said hoarsely, \u201c\u2026Be good.\u201dSo Xie Yu dropped his hand to clutch at the sheets beneath him. His skin was already pale, the loop of red thread around his wrist even more eye-catching in contrast.After they were done, Xie Yu went to the bathroom to shower and found his legs were a little weak.A messy pile of clothes lay at his feet.He Zhao started to say, \u201cI\u2019ll help you shower,\u201d but before he finished, a certain little friend who turned hostile the moment he got out of bed retorted, \u201cGet lost.\u201dXie Yu held onto the wall and picked up two pieces of clothing, then walked barefoot into the bathroom.Xie Yu took a quick shower. He had just turned off the faucet, the sound of water growing quiet, when he heard a bout of knocking at the door.\u201cBig bros, are you there?!\u201d\u201cIs it this room? It\u2019s this room, right?\u201d\u201cBig bros?\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d When He Zhao opened the door, he still hadn\u2019t finished putting on his clothes. Through his wide open collar, two scratch marks were faintly visible. \u201cYou\u2019re not sleeping?\u201dWan Da stuck his head into the room and looked around. \u201cWhere\u2019s Yu-ge?\u201dHe Zhao tsked and pushed Wan Da\u2019s head back out. \u201cWatch where you\u2019re looking. He\u2019s showering. Spit it out.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like this\u2026 are you interested in coming along on a man\u2019s quest?\u201dWan Da and the others had grown tired of playing cards, but were still so excited they couldn\u2019t sleep. They remembered that on the bus they had looked up the amenities nearby and found that there was a nearby park. Rumor had it there was a very famous wishing pool in the park.Luo Wenqiang forcibly cut in. \u201cRight, right. Looking at the reviews, it\u2019s very effective. We\u2019re going to go out and try it.\u201dHe Zhao said, \u201cHow do you all have so many little girls\u2019 dreams and thoughts?\u201dLuo Wenqiang was about to continue when he caught sight of Xie Yu coming out of the bathroom.Xie Yu was wearing only a black T-shirt, radiating aloofness. The corners of his eyes were red, as if he had just cried, but also like that wasn\u2019t the case. \u201cWhat wishing pool?\u201dThe news of the night raid on the wishing pool spread from one person to ten and, within ten minutes, the whole class knew.More and more people gathered in the corridor. Xie Yu just sat down on the carpet in the corridor and discovered that, ultimately, this lot didn\u2019t care in the least about the wishing pool. The atmosphere of breaking the rules as a group and furtively going out in the middle of the night to cause mischief was the important part.\u201cLet\u2019s plan our battle route.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll go down by the elevator, then form groups of three.\u201d\u201cWatch out. There are security cameras in the lobby, but we can\u2019t do anything about that. We have to let the security cameras record our crimes!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dXu Qingqing was the first to use her fists to hit someone. \u201cHao-zi, is something wrong with your brain? What kind of idiot plan is this?\u201dNear midnight, the night was dark and heavy.The park was indeed close by, just across the street. But the area containing the wishing pool was not open to the public after hours so they had to climb over the fence and sneak in.The crying of insects sounded everywhere.The dozen of them were like thieves. Xie Yu found it embarrassing and even took out his mask and put it on.\u201cIt\u2019s so dark. Who can see your face clearly?\u201d He Zhao smiled as he reached out and hooked a finger around the string at Xie Yu\u2019s ear. \u201cLittle friend, you have a heavy burden.\u201dThe so-called wishing pool was just a little pond. A thick layer of coins covered the bottom.Liu Cunhao was especially sincere and nearly knelt down in front of it. \u201cBless all of us with high scores in the college exams.\u201dLuo Wenqiang said, \u201cI hope Hao-zi\u2019s wish comes true.\u201dWan Da said, \u201cPlus one.\u201dXie Yu happened to touch a small stone. He picked it up and tossed it in the pool, where it made several ripples. He couldn\u2019t help laughing. \u201cPlus one?\u201dHe Zhao noticed that Luo Wenqiang was carrying a bag in his hand and reached out to nudge it. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d\u201cFireworks I bought at the temple fair.\u201d Luo Wenqiang had resolved to act out the dreamy wishes of his little girl\u2019s heart to the end. \u201cThis makes it feel more ceremonial\u2026\u201dHearing this, the others all crowded around. \u201cFireworks?\u201dXie Yu retreated several paces and sat on a nearby step, watching them work out how to light the fireworks.He Zhao walked over and sat shoulder to shoulder with him.After a while, Xie Yu heard He Zhao call him, \u201cXie Yu.\u201dHe Zhao felt around in his pocket for a while, eventually coming up with something and handing it to Xie Yu.It was a letter.By the faint light of the streetlamps, Xie Yu could barely make out several ostentatious words: To my little friend.Xie Yu held onto the edge of the envelope and was stunned for a second.There wasn\u2019t a long screed inside, only two lonely lines.\u2014Let\u2019s go together. To somewhere even further away.\u201cAfter it\u2019s lit, everybody back off quickly.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll count. Three, two, one, light!\u201d\u201cWait. This firework doesn\u2019t look quite right\u2026\u201dA loud explosion swiftly followed.Xie Yu was so blown away by the firecracker\u2019s earth-shaking explosion that his ears hurt. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat the fuck is this?!\u201dLiu Cunhao had been slow and was the last to back off, and he felt that even his butt had taken a hard hit. \u201cWenqiang, explain this. This is a firework? You lied to us! This is a firecracker!\u201dThe explosion could have cracked apart the sky and the earth. The whole park seemed to shake.Before they could \u2018clean up after themselves,\u2019 the park superintendent came over, following the sound. The bright light of his flashlight drew close and swept the area around the wishing pool. \u201c\u2014Who\u2019s there?! What are you doing?! Stop right there! Don\u2019t run!\u201dPandemonium erupted. Class 3 ran for their lives and as they ran they didn\u2019t forget to offer up their sincerest apologies. \u201cWe\u2019re sorry!\u201dRepeating in Xie Yu\u2019s mind was the line, \u2018Somewhere even farther away.\u2019Before he could react, someone caught hold of his wrist. Then he heard He Zhao yell, \u201cOld Xie, run\u2014\u201dThe steps weren\u2019t high. Out of habit, the two of them jumped straight down.For a moment, there was nothing beneath their feet.They welcomed the wind that rushed up to meet their faces, the pinpricks of starlight above, and the lights that ran endlessly in both directions on the street, stretching into the horizon.(Main Story Complete)[]This is the last chapter of Fake Slackers!

Please exit through the rear doors.\u201dThe public bus set out from the suburbs of B City, circled around, and slowly turned into the business district. Streets stretched in all directions and pedestrians bustled about.The announcer spoke crisply. Unlike the usual Putonghua,\u00b9 the announcer\u2019s words sounded mechanical, and even the lilt on his last word seemed deliberate.Xie Yu, who sat in the corner seat of the last row, turned his head to glance in the direction of the burning sunlight outside the window.He felt that the temperature in the bus was turned down too low, but he also felt hot.The bus had already been moving slowly. Now that it was surrounded on all sides by a flow of people, its speed directly plummeted to that of an old grandpa of a vehicle. It met a red light and its long body shuddered violently before slowing to a stop.Xie Yu had his phone in hand. He looked out the window as he waited for the other person to pick up the phone.The dial tone sounded for a while before the call finally connected. Familiar background noise emerged from the speaker, followed closely by a woman\u2019s voice. Her voice was loud and overpowered the chaos; it was forceful and a little hoarse. She was quarrelling with someone.\u201cWho knows when those six shipments of goods will arrive. None of them are reliable. That lot just makes excuses all day.\u201d\u201cOne moment they say tomorrow, the next, the day after tomorrow. They keep changing it and in the end they told me even they didn\u2019t know\u2026 Fuck it.\u201dXie Yu calmly listened to the woman rant.\u201cRush, my ass! Now they don\u2019t even take my calls and pull a disappearing act on me. They must have been pulled out of a dog\u2019s ass. Don\u2019t they know anything? In all of Black Water Street, who dares annoy me, Xu Yanmei?\u201dShe could yell an entire 800-word mini-essay without pausing to take a breath. Hearing her cursing get worse and worse, Xie Yu finally said something. \u201cAunt Mei.\u201dInstantly, all the cursing stopped.Xu Yanmei waved her hand at the other people and shut her mouth. She even snuffed out the cigarette clasped between her fingers without hesitation, pressing its burning end casually against the corner of the table. She then pointed at the phone on the table that had unexpectedly connected the call, indicating that the \u2018Meeting To Discuss The Six Shipments That Were Not Delivered On Time\u2019 was adjourned.After putting out her cigarette, she took down her long legs which she had propped up and crossed on the cheap office desk. When she spoke next her voice was gentle to a degree the other people present had never heard before, as if she was a completely different person from the madwoman whose cursing was as heavy as two tons.\u201cDuring lunch we get together to shoot the breeze, nothing much, just for fun. Life\u2019s so boring. Occasionally cursing is good for the spirit\u2026\u201dXie Yu didn\u2019t expose her. He only asked, \u201cWhat about smoking? Smoking is also good for you?\u201dXu Yanmei, reeking of nicotine, lied through her teeth as she figured he wouldn\u2019t be able to squeeze himself out through her phone to confirm anyway. \u201cI\u2019m not smoking. After you told me to stop smoking, I quit. Ah, don\u2019t talk to me about this. If you talk about it I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll relapse. Don\u2019t provoke me.\u201dTo her credit, she acted well. Who was provoking who?Xie Yu heard her hoarse smoker\u2019s voice which was getting worse by the day. Only when cursing people out did her voice suddenly become clear. Even if he had toes for brains, he\u2019d know whether her words were true or not.\u201cYou\u2019re on break, aren\u2019t you? I heard from your mom a while ago that your last exam was on the 20th. Why didn\u2019t you reply to my texts?\u201dXu Yanmei continued to change the subject: \u201cHow did the exams go? I looked on the internet for a very long time before finding those quotes. All so literary, I nearly hurled when I found them.\u201dDon\u2019t be worried when you face the exam paper. As long as you do your best, what you receive are good results! Let your dreams raise their sails and set sail in the exam hall! Let your life float in the ocean of knowledge! Little grasshopper, do your best on the exams!Xie Yu wasn\u2019t sure why he was able to recite this unoriginal message verbatim. It was clich\u00e9, the aphorisms were recognizable at a glance, and it didn\u2019t fit the texting aesthetic of today\u2019s youth at all.The bus entered a tunnel, which blocked the burning sun. His surroundings went dark.Xie Yu was wearing all black and now he was completely immersed in darkness. He leaned back in the seat and stretched his long legs, which were curled up in the tight space, and casually smiled. \u201cBut you still sent them? You know what my grades are like. What did you want me to reply? Thanks for the encouragement and I\u2019ll do my best not to be dead last?\u201dHaving rested for less than two minutes, the eldest sister of Black Water Street, Comrade Xu Yanmei, suddenly heard someone complaining behind her: \u201cIs this a black market shop or a wholesale market? The prices are so high. This is sabotage.\u201d\u201c\u2026 What did you say?\u201d Having been disturbed, Xu Yanmei didn\u2019t hear Xie Yu\u2019s reply properly. \u201cIt\u2019s too damn noisy. A bunch of idiots came and tried to break things in the shop. Tomorrow, I\u2019ll go buy a big loudspeaker. I don\u2019t believe I can\u2019t keep this bunch of grandchildren in line.\u201dXie Yu\u2019s fingers tightened slightly on his phone. The words he wanted to say hung on his lips for a while, but in the end they didn\u2019t make it any further. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d\u201cI saw the text. I was busy with revision and forgot to answer.\u201d\u201cGood, good, good. Although your grades are a little bit bad, don\u2019t be discouraged. You can\u2019t give up until the end. Who\u2019s afraid of who, right?\u201dAs Xu Yamnei spoke, her voice got louder again. She held the receiver away from her and yelled at the customers who were still talking about making trouble: \u201cWhat the hell are you doing! If someone\u2019s in trouble, it\u2019s you goddamn bastards. Are you buying or not? If not, quit dawdling!\u201dThe bus emerged from the mouth of the tunnel. Large patches of sunlight began shining into the bus again, starting from the front of the bus and leading into the back.Xie Yu narrowed his eyes slightly. Seeing the familiar scenery outside the window, he knew his stop was coming up.Today was Monday, the third day of summer vacation and a workday. There weren\u2019t many people on the bus.Several students sat in the front row. The girls had their hair in braids and still carried their satchels properly and obediently, even though they were going out to have fun. Their clothes were white and clean.Although Black Water Street was in the shopping district, the prices were down-to-earth and not expensive, and it couldn\u2019t be termed \u2018extravagant\u2019. The buildings in the suburbs were all of low quality and the houses were run-down. But the cheap costs attracted many visitors who didn\u2019t have a lot of disposable income, especially first-years in high school.Xie Yu eyed a glass ornament in a girl\u2019s hair tie, clear with a hint of pink. It glimmered in the light.\u201cWe\u2019re here, we\u2019re here. Get ready to get off.\u201d The girl tossed her braid and held the railing as she got up. \u201cI ate the fried nian gao here. I\u2019ll take you there.\u201dAt the same time\u2014\u201cSouth Station, Black Water Street. Passengers, please exit through the rear door. Thank you for your cooperation.\u201dThe bus slowed to a stop. The instant the doors opened, a gust of hot dry wind rushed in.Xu Yanmei thought she had heard wrongly. \u201cGrasshopper, where are you? Why did I hear the announcement say Black Water Street?\u201dXie Yu stood and got off the bus. \u201cComrade Xu Yanmei, in about ten minutes I\u2019ll be at the wholesale market\u2019s front door. Think properly about how you\u2019re going to take care of the smell of cigarettes and how you\u2019re going to explain it to me. Think about what you promised me back then, too. Hold your head up when you meet me.\u201dXu Yanmei turned and glanced at the ashtray full of cigarette butts on her office desk. \u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cMei-jie, what happened? Why the glum face?\u201dXu Yanmei pushed open the door and walked out. Rolling up her sleeves, she entered the warehouse and started helping the shop owners with their work. \u201cDon\u2019t talk about it. I\u2019ll die from frustration.\u201dXu Yanmei operated a clothing wholesale market on Black Water Street. She\u2019d been in the clothing business for more than ten years. In the beginning, she had put up a stall by the roadside with several of her friends. Later, it had become a proper shop. In the end, they took over two floors in the Guang Mao Expo in the middle of Black Water Street\u2014and these two floors contained more than a hundred small shops which formed a wholesale market.As the female boss of the wholesale market, Mei-jie\u2019s name was very well known on Black Water Street.\u201cYou\u2019re frustrated, really? It looks to me like this slight smile of yours isn\u2019t slight at all,\u201d one of the shop owners said.Xu Yanmei said, \u201cWhat nonsense are you saying? Also, do you have perfume or anything like that? Let me borrow it. Xiao Yu-er is about to get here and I stink of cigarette smoke. If he catches me, he\u2019ll give me hell.\u201dThe shop owner straightened up and dusted off his trousers: \u201cSo it\u2019s that precious son of yours. Look how scared you are, you\u2019re\u2026 I have perfume. Let me go find it for you.\u201d\u201cHow can I not be scared? My Xiao Yu is a good boy.\u201d Xu Yanmei\u2019s voice was very quiet. With one hand she exerted strength on a small knife to open a bag of wrapping string, saying to herself, \u201cI can\u2019t lead him astray.\u201d\u201c\u2026 He\u2019s not your biological son anyway. Just your godson, right?\u201d\u201cWhat good boy? My son is in the same class as Xie Yu. He\u2019s thorny. To say nothing of his bad grades, nobody in class dares to share a desk with him. He even seems to be some school gang leader and mixes with that sort of crowd. Only you, Mei-jie, hold him up like some kind of treasure and don\u2019t even curse in front of him.\u201d\u201cI heard he even cheated on the high school entrance exams. If not, with his grades, he\u2019d only pass if he encountered a ghost. Even though Er Zhong isn\u2019t that good of a school, even a regular high school\u00b2 at rock-bottom is still a regular high school.\u201d\u201cForget it, don\u2019t talk about it any more. Go back to work.\u201dBy the time Xu Yanmei undid the wrapping string, the group of chatty shop employees had dispersed. Each stood in front of their stalls, which were a meter wide at most, and started hawking their wares: \u201cTwo for 99, two for 99! If you miss today, come back next year! Down jackets are out of season and this is a clearance sale!\u201d\u201cCome over here and take a look! Two for 99!\u201dXu Yanmei walked over, a cloud of perfume following her. \u201cI\u2019ll go out for a bit. If anything comes up, give me a call. If there are idiots who can\u2019t read the room, don\u2019t try to reason with them, got it? Just yell at them. Reason, my ass. Reason is for humans, not for idiots.\u201dXie Yu took a roundabout route, and after visiting three different tchotchke stores he finally found a loudspeaker with a volume enhancer.It was red and white and he found it at the bottom of a pile of miscellaneous goods. The shop owner wanted to show that it still worked even though it was covered with a layer of dust; he immediately plugged it in and played the song \u201cDamned Gentleness.\u201dIt was indeed very strong. It was so loud it could burst eardrums.Xie Yu\u2019s ears hurt from the volume. As he dug his money out he said, \u201cAll right, that\u2019s enough. How much is it?\u201dThe shopkeeper was very close to the loudspeaker and he didn\u2019t hear what Xie Yu said at all. He rubbed at the dust on the loudspeaker with his sleeve and raised his voice to continue promoting the item with all his might. He was an elderly man and really quite old, and it was incredible that he could still yell so loudly: \u201c\u2013Durable! If it\u2019s broken, full refund! Full refund!\u201d\u201cHow much?\u201d\u201cQuality guaranteed! If there are problems just come to me! This shop is small, won\u2019t change its line of business, and won\u2019t change its name! Jian Xing Goods!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dA hand stretched in front of the old man. Slender, fine-boned, well-kept with clean nails.With a blank face, Xie Yu pressed the on-off switch. It was finally quiet. \u201cHow much.\u201d\u201cTwen\u2026 twenty-five.\u201dThe elderly man held up two fingers then five before saying, \u201cDo you want it? If you want it I\u2019ll wrap it up for you.\u201dBefore Xie Yu could nod, the old man had already picked up a plastic bag and put the loudspeaker in it. Faster than the eye could see, he pulled several sheets of unknown origin from a thick stack under the table and stuffed them in the bag, too.\u2014\u2014Women\u2019s clinic. Painless abortion.\u2014\u2014Men\u2019s blessing. Second stick half-off.Not only did he man a tchotchke store, he also bore the heavy responsibility of giving out leaflets. Xie Yu had now gained a new understanding of the proactiveness and professionalism of the people of Black Water Street.The old man wasn\u2019t done stuffing the bag and tossed another few sheets in. From the different colors, broadly speaking, the leaflets all seemed to be unique. \u201cSide job, side job. I respond to the clarion call and strive towards middle-classdom. I work hard in order to make my fortune\u2026 Here\u2019s your change, don\u2019t drop it. Come back again!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I'll teach you.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayFake SlackersTranslator: JuryEditor: NomNomFirst Published on Chaleuria\u2014002 \u2013 No one taught you manners? I\u2019ll teach you.Those flyers covered nearly all walks of employment, from circumcision to microfinancing\u2014 everything one could want. There were even ads for locksmiths, miracle Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioners, private detectives, professional exam-takers\u2026.Xie Yu pulled them straight out and tossed them in the garbage bin. When he reached the last flyer, he saw written on top: Mystery Game, inflaming your passion! Big brother, ah~ come~The tildes were so flirtatious they could break through the heavens. Xie Yu was just about to toss it out when he heard someone loudly call out from behind him, \u201cDamn brat.\u201d Xie Yu\u2019s hand jerked and his train of thought was broken. Reflexively he stuffed the flyer into the pocket of his pants.Xu Yanmei rubbed her hands together: \u201cYou found the time to come see me?\u201dThe first thing Xie Yu did upon seeing her was to pass her the black plastic bag, then swiftly retreat several steps. But he hadn\u2019t escaped in time: \u201cWhat is that smell on you? Toilet air freshener? What are you doing spraying that for no reason??\u201d\u201cLike hell it\u2019s toilet air freshener. Damn it, this is a woman\u2019s scent.\u201d She\u2019d put on about half a bottle of perfume.She opened the plastic bag. She froze for a couple of seconds when she saw the contents: \u201cI was just saying, and you really got me a big megaphone. How does this work? Is this the on switch?\u201dA vein in Xie Yu\u2019s temple jumped with a pop. \u201cDon\u2019t press that. It\u2019ll make noise.\u201dToo late. Xu Yanmei had already pressed down on the red button like a child who had just received a new toy. The song that hadn\u2019t finished playing in the convenience store now blared out from the speakers, forceful and enduring.Xu Yanmei was a little stunned. \u201cDamn, it\u2019s this loud?\u201d\u201cQuick, turn it off,\u201d Xie Yu said. \u201cAnd that voice of yours. You really don\u2019t notice? The smoking\u2026 just smoke, then\u201dXu Yanmei: \u201cIt\u2019s not like that\u2026 With this strong constitution of mine, I\u2019ll still fight on for the next three hundred years at least.\u201dXie Yu was silent as he observed her. He noticed at once that her right hand was supporting the side of her waist, as if unconsciously. Due to long years of hard labor, Xu Yanmei\u2019s back wasn\u2019t doing well. Every day she had to stick on a medicinal patch or she else might be in so much pain that she wouldn\u2019t be able to get out of bed.\u201cStrong. You really dare say that.\u201dXu Yanmei noticed Xie Yu\u2019s gaze and immediately lowered her hand. Who knew how much truth was in what she said as she smoothly ran outside: \u201cMy back is fine. Speaking of which, last time you asked me to go to the hospital for an examination. I went. It went well. The doctor said it wasn\u2019t a major problem.\u201dXie Yu walked toward the Guang Mao Expo as he listened. He wore an ordinary, even somewhat cheap, black T-shirt\u2014Xu Yanmei had bought it for him. She often sent him clothes: if she saw something suitable, she\u2019d buy it, and after accumulating enough, she would send them over in a big cardboard box about half the height of a person.He stuck both hands in his pockets. His sleeves were folded up several times and revealed his slender wrists. His hair was medium length and it looked soft to the touch, curling naturally due to how fine it was, and giving him a cold, fierce look.He asked: \u201cHow many truckloads of merchandise are shipping today?\u201dXu Yanmei was forty-plus years old, and usually she was busy with receiving and sending shipments of goods. All day she had to keep her eye on this and that; the riff-raff who messed up the store and caused trouble were all hers to deal with, so she didn\u2019t have much time to take care of herself. Her hair was still in the same perm she had gotten last New Year\u2019s. Without maintenance, it now looked like messy instant noodles, dry and yellowing.From her features it was easy to see the beauty of her youth, but time spares no one.If she were tossed into a crowd, she would only be a middle-aged woman, extremely ordinary, to the point that one might suspect that the glimpse of former beauty one could see in her features was simply imagined.\u201cEighteen truckloads. Even though it\u2019s summer, I still have to keep an eye on the autumn fashions, otherwise the suppliers might not have enough time to finish the orders when the time comes.\u201d Now that the subject had come around to work, Xu Yanmei unconsciously reached for her pocket, hoping to find a cigarette to satisfy her craving. But she only found a lighter and no cigarette.Xie Yu asked, \u201cDo you have enough help?\u201d\u201dEnough, enough. No need for you to bother,\u201d Xu Yanmei said. \u201cI still haven\u2019t settled the score from last time when you arrived out of nowhere to help over here.\u201dXie Yu had coincidentally found out that she had thrown out her back while moving goods. He had skipped a day of class and by the time she found him, he had already blended in among the workers and helped move four or five truckloads of goods. He had changed out of his school uniform and was sweating all over.This had been when business at the wholesale market wasn\u2019t good; only in the last half year had things gotten better, so the fewer workers she could employ to move goods, the fewer she employed. Managing two floors of Guang Mao was effort enough, so of course she would think about how to reduce costs.The two stood in the elevator, and their proximity made the scent of perfume that was like air freshener curdle into something even more intense. This service elevator might also have been used to transport meat because, aside from the overpowering perfume scent, there was also the faint smell of rotting fish.Xu Yanmei asked: \u201cDid you grow taller again?\u201dXie Yu said: \u201cAlmost 1.8 meters now.\u201dXu Yanmei eyed him up and down, wanting to smile and frown at the same time. \u201cYou\u2019ve lost weight.\u201dThe elevator opened and Xie Yu walked out. Xu Yanmei was still fixated on the \u2018lost weight\u2019 part: \u201cRemember to eat your regular three meals a day. Young people nowadays go on diets at the drop of a hat. Don\u2019t get obsessed with it\u2026 Eh, why did you stop?Xie Yu stood in front of her, blocking her entire field of vision so she couldn\u2019t see anything.\u201cWhat is it? What happened?\u201dXie Yu didn\u2019t give her a chance to see what was happening ahead.He just pushed Xu Yanmei back into the elevator and swiftly and cleanly hit the door close button.His reaction was fast\u2014so fast that even the group of ill-intentioned-looking guys didn\u2019t have time to react. By the time they realized what was happening, the elevator doors were already closing.\u201cFuck.\u201d The guy at the front wore a fierce expression. A gold chain encircled his neck and he ripped a cigarette from between his teeth, tossing it casually by his foot as he walked forward, cursing. \u201c\u2014\u2014Xu Yanmei, you damn bitch, you fucking stop right there!\u201dHe was the only person who reacted quickly enough\u2014the other guys hadn\u2019t even realized that the woman they were looking for was about to slip away right in front of their eyes. The man with the gold chain waved one big hand, his rage unstoppable: \u201cWhat are you all standing there for? Get her! All of you just standing around and watching the show. You! Quick, go down the stairs over there and catch her!\u201dThe elevator doors were already half-closed. Xie Yu lowered his voice and said quickly, \u201cGo down first. Bring people back here.\u201dXu Yanmei caught a glimpse of the man\u2019s face through the elevator doors. There were too many things she wanted to say but time was tight so she hurriedly yelled, \u201cXie Yu!\u201dXie Yu looked at her: \u201cAunt Mei, listen to me.\u201dHe only looked at her for a moment before the gap between the doors disappeared as they closed firmly shut and the elevator carrying her descended.A mop stood beside the elevator, probably forgotten there by a janitor who had finished their work. Xie Yu grabbed it, lifted one foot, and stepped on the mop head. He exerted strength and ripped the whole wooden handle out.Brandishing the wooden stick, Xie Yu raised his head to look at them: \u201cWhat do you want?\u201dHe knew this lot.Black Water Street was full of gangsters who caused trouble up and down the street in the name of collecting protection fees. This man in front of him was Hu-ge\u2014word had it that he had been released from jail a few months ago. According to him, he was locked up because he had almost stabbed someone to death. Unbelievable bluster. Regardless of how he touted it, no one really cared about what the truth of the matter really was.Hu-ge managed to scrape a living by collecting protection fees and enjoyed being respected as the \u2018big brother\u2019 by underlings who didn\u2019t know any better. Until he met Xu Yanmei. Everything started with just one event: he had fallen for her.Xu Yanmei was quite beautiful, and her personality was forceful and ardent.She had just one flaw: she was ungrateful. Over and over she had rejected him\u2026 really, she didn\u2019t know a good thing when she saw it.At this point, Hu-ge\u2019s eyes darkened. \u201cBrat, mind your own business.\u201dXie Yu still didn\u2019t react. The shop employees, who had shrunk into a corner and were too afraid to make a sound, had their hearts in their throats. This was their first time encountering such a matter. This lot had walked in like they owned the place and started breaking things; one could tell at a glance that they weren\u2019t to be trifled with.They weren\u2019t sure whether to call the cops. Everyone knew the unwritten rules of Black Water Street: what happens in Black Water stays in Black Water.Then they saw Mei-jie\u2019s so-called \u201cgood boy\u201d standing in the elevator doorway. One against five. His expression was blank. His hand slipped out of his pocket and beckoned lightly to the group of people. It was impossible to tell if it was a challenge or if he really didn\u2019t care. \u201cYou really want to die so much you\u2019ve come to daddy\u2019s door? No time for bullshit. Come on, all at once.\u201d\u201d\u2026\u2026\u201dHu-ge didn\u2019t want to admit that, for an instant, he was cowed by this boy who looked like he was still in school.The glint in the kid\u2019s eye was dark, chilling, like being dumped in a cold water bath. He looked at them like he was looking at a pile of shit\u2014all in all, it definitely wasn\u2019t the gaze of a hothouse flowerbud.Hu-ge was really getting angry and began to posture out of habit. He pulled aside his collar. \u201cSo young and already so full of hot air. Do you know who I am? Go out and ask around. Is there anyone who sees me, Hu-ge, and doesn\u2019t show respect? \u2026See this? This scar on my neck? This is from a fight with the prison guards. You brat, you don\u2019t even have facial hair, what do you care about that bitch? What is this, huh? Fighting me? Copying other people and trying to fight? Just with that little wooden stick, you think\u2014\u201dWithout another word Xie Yu stretched out and caught Hu-ge by the collar, drawing intimidatingly close. His knee crashed brutally into Hu-ge\u2019s stomach and swiftly, after he trapped Hu-ge\u2019s elbow with his hand, he pulled Hu-ge to him without giving even a second of leeway.It was a very elegant shoulder throw, neat and clean. If the atmosphere weren\u2019t so tense, the bunch of shopkeepers in the back might even have applauded and cheered.Hu-ge was knocked to the ground so hard his vision went dark and he couldn\u2019t speak a word.But Xie Yu wasn\u2019t going to let him off so easily. He dragged the guy up from the floor again and pushed him against the steel doors of the elevator with a thud. His fingers tightened around Hu-ge\u2019s neck!\u201cSo arrogant. You think jail time is a man\u2019s badge of honor?\u201dHu-ge reacted. He raised his leg and was about to kick but Xie Yu firmly hit the offending leg with the stick. Hu-ge\u2019s calf twitched uncontrollably and the moment Xie Yu let go he fell heavily onto the ground, one hand propping himself up while the other clutched his stomach as he dry heaved. \u201c\u2026Fuck.\u201d\u201cWho did you call a bitch.\u201d Hu-ge\u2019s eyes were wide as he looked at Xie Yu\u2019s face, which could be called beautiful, gradually drawing closer. The youth\u2019s face was brimming with violent intent and about to overflow. Compared to this outstanding beauty, he was even more surprised by the chilly, sharp aura emanating from the person in front of him.Xie Yu repeated his earlier question, tamping down on his anger, his voice low. \u201cWho did you call a bitch?\u201dHu-ge said nothing.\u201dIf no one taught you how to behave, I\u2019ll teach you.\u201d Xie Yu kicked the pile of rubbish with the tip of his foot.The few guys behind Hu-ge looked back and forth for a few moments, all seeing hesitation in each other\u2019s eyes. Then, in unspoken unison, they turned and ran.\u201cNow we\u2019re really finished. What should we do?\u201dThe taller one asked as he ran, \u201cShould we call the police?\u201d\u201dCall the police, my ass!\u201d the other one said. \u201cIf we do that, how can we do business here in the future?\u201dGu Xuelan was taking afternoon tea when she got the call from the police station.The woman removed her silk shawl. She wore a haute couture lace dress underneath, well-tailored to her curves and unspeakably elegant. Two dark flowers were discreetly embroidered at the hem of the skirt. Her ankles were slender and pale like bright jade.Carefully styled long hair fell on either side of her face. She smiled as she listened to the rich women opposite her chatting about the winter fashions they had their eyes on recently, occasionally putting in a word or two: \u201cMadam Chen, since you like it so much, maybe you could fly over and buy it\u2026\u201d\u201cMadam, a call for you.\u201dGu Xuelan turned away. Her finger rested on the ceramic cup and she asked casually, \u201cWho called?\u201dThe person held up the phone, unsure whether or not to answer. After several seconds of hesitation, he bent at the waist to Gu Xuelan\u2019s ear and said in a low voice only they could hear: \u201cPo-police station. The second young master fought with someone and it was pretty serious. The other side is demanding that we pay the medical bills. Madam, what do you think we should do about this? Send someone to take a look?\u201dGu Xuelan\u2019s expression changed with a whoosh.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What street are you from?The Public Security Bureau of B City, Black Water Town.\u201cYou\u2019re Xie Yu\u2019s guardian?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m his mother.\u201d Gu Xuelan stood in the police station, clearly out of her element. \u201cIs he all right? Is he injured? How much are the medical bills? I\u2019ll pay anything, as long as you can release him right away.\u201dThe policewoman didn\u2019t even raise her head. With a well-practiced movement, she plucked a piece of paper from a folder to her right and slapped it on the table: \u201cForget about that for now and fill out this form first.\u201dAfter a while the policewoman finished the work at hand, capped her pen, and looked up. \u201cYour son\u2019s quite something. One against five, and all the injuries he inflicted were internal. No one would notice they\u2019re injured without a hospital examination. \u201dGu Xuelan froze, unsure how she should react.The policewoman gave her a once-over and asked casually, \u201cYou two aren\u2019t from around here, are you?\u201dGu Xuelan said: \u201cWe\u2026 are from A City.\u201dThis fighting incident of Xie Yu\u2019s wasn\u2019t serious. Although the guys who called the cops had blathered on about how their big brother had been bullied, held down on the ground, and violently beaten, the cops taking their statements all had their doubts.They had received countless police reports and this was the first time they had met \u2018victims\u2019 like this: with multicolored mohawks, pierced ears and noses, reeking of smoke, and arms covered with loud tattoos\u2014a black dragon on the left, a white tiger on the right. And the ID numbers they provided\u2014after checking, the officers found out that they were all delinquent youth with a record.\u201cEverything you said here is the truth?\u201d\u201cThe truth, definitely the complete truth. Our big brother still can\u2019t even stand up.\u201dSo they turned their gazes back to the man with the hateful face and the gold \u201cdog chain\u201d around his neck. The man was clutching his stomach, muttering nonstop, \u201cHurts to death, ah you hey\u2026 bullying a decent man, now? Why are kids these days like that\u2026 hurts, hurts, hurts. Even hurts to talk.\u201dGu Xuelan filled in the form and signed her name in the lower right corner.The policewoman said, \u201cAlright, wait here. Your son\u2019s still giving his statement.\u201dGu Xuelan clutched her purse. She didn\u2019t want to tarry too long. \u201cStill giving his statement?\u201d She had immediately rushed over from A City after getting the call; it was a full two hours\u2019 car ride away.The policewoman looked at her: \u201cThe statements from both sides don\u2019t match up.\u201dIn the interrogation room.Xie Yu repeated for the third time: \u201cI didn\u2019t hit him.\u201dIn the past two hours\u2014neither a long nor short time\u2014Hu-ge had personally experienced the twists and turns of life, and what it was like to be utterly down on his luck. The brat in front of him, who was just in high school, had taught him a lesson\u2014in shamelessness.He sat opposite Xie Yu. The long table was quite wide and he slapped his hand on the table, yelling so loudly his shout almost tore through the roof: \u201c\u2014Fuck it all! Officer! He\u2019s lying!\u201dThe policeman wasn\u2019t to be trifled with either. Working in the Black Water Street area, even the gentlest of personalities would be filed to a sharp edge. \u201cFuck what fuck? Sit down properly. What do you think you\u2019re doing?! If you can\u2019t, then get out. Did I say you could talk?\u201dHu-ge reluctantly sat back down.The policeman turned to look at the \u2018fragile youth\u2019 sitting opposite Hu-ge and his voice softened a fraction. \u201cXie Yu, was it? Don\u2019t be afraid. With us here, he wouldn\u2019t dare do anything to you.\u201dXie Yu said, quietly and timidly and also politely: \u201cThank you, uncle officer.\u201dHu-ge was so mad he almost leapt across the table to tear apart Xie Yu\u2019s fake mask. \u201cDon\u2019t fucking put on an act! I\u2019m the one who got beaten up! I\u2019m the victim!\u201dThe policeman slapped the table with a folder. \u201cIf you make any more noise you can get out! Look at how you\u2019re scaring the kid!\u201dXie Yu obligingly flinched, pretending that he was being frightened by the mafia. Although he wasn\u2019t especially attentive to his acting, the effect was unmistakable.Fake, it\u2019s all fake! You\u2019re blind!Hu-ge internally screamed.What kind of devil is he! So young and he already knows how to put on a sheepskin!This is very clearly a damn wolf!When Xie Yu left, night had already fallen. He hadn\u2019t had to take any responsibility and had gotten off scot-free.Under the embellishments of the wholesale market aunties, Hu-ge\u2019s crimes were set in stone and his injuries were accepted as \u201conly the devil knows who beat him up or where.\u201d He had to pay five hundred bucks out of his own pocket and write a statement deeply reflecting on his activities, swearing never to bring trouble to the people of Black Water Street again, and promising to turn over a new leaf and start anew.Hu-ge\u2019s butt stuck up into the air as he lay on the table. A Xinhua dictionary lay beside his hand; when he didn\u2019t know how to write a word, they made him look it up. They didn\u2019t let him write in pinyin.This was the most humiliating experience of his life.When Xie Yu walked out, Hu-ge called out to stop him.The police officer held a baton in his hand, fully prepared. He warned loudly: \u201cChen Xionghu! What are you trying to do?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not trying anything. You\u2019re right there holding me down. What can I do? I just want to say something to him.\u201d Hu-ge eyed Xie Yu and asked, not giving up, \u201cWhat street are you from?\u201d\u00b9Xie Yu stopped walking and looked at him with a complicated expression which could be distilled down to, \u2018looking at an idiot\u2019.Hu-ge repeated once more, not giving up: \u201cWhat street exactly are you from?!\u201d He felt that the underground forces behind this person were deep and unfathomable. He had to know which god he had offended this time; if he were to die, he wanted to understand why.Under Hu-ge\u2019s burning gaze, Xie Yu languidly opened his mouth: \u201cMe? I follow the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics.\u201d\u00b2Hu-ge: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dA familiar silver Bentley was parked outside the police station. Gu Xuelan sat in the car and her profile could be faintly seen through the window.Xie Yu got in the car. \u201cMom.\u201dGu Xuelan said nothing.Xie Yu followed up: \u201cActually, you didn\u2019t need to come over today. I know how to clean up.\u201dThat Hu-ge\u2014from the start, Xie Yu had known he was just posturing. A real villain wouldn\u2019t keep blathering on proudly about how he\u2019d \u2018been to jail;\u2019 more than that, a real villain wouldn\u2019t have gotten drunk and only dared to go over to Guang Mao when it was temporarily deserted. Finally, he was even stupid enough to call the police himself.Silence hung in the air. When the car had traveled some distance, Gu Xuelan said: \u201cYou still remember that I\u2019m your mom? What did you come all the way out here for? Even the police said you weren\u2019t the one who beat him up\u2026 it was you who beat him up though, wasn\u2019t it.\u201dXie Yu leaned back in the seat and said in an indifferent tone: \u201cIt was me who beat him up. Did I embarrass you?\u201dGu Xuelan\u2019s hand tightened its grip on the plush seat cover, her knuckles showing. After a pause, she said harshly, \u201cYes, you embarrassed me! If you know it\u2019s embarrassing then stop doing these embarrassing things!\u201dIn the front, the driver sighed and interceded: \u201cSecond young master, don\u2019t talk back to madam. Madam was worrying about you the whole time on the way here. She was so afraid something had happened to you.\u201dXie Yu wanted to say, don\u2019t call me second young master. I\u2019m not your Zhong family\u2019s second young master.Every time he heard those three words he felt thoroughly uncomfortable, like he was being forced to wear an ill-fitting outfit that wrapped around his neck so he couldn\u2019t breathe.Gu Xuelan calmed down and changed the subject. \u201cI found several tutors for you. Starting tomorrow until school starts back up. Don\u2019t go anywhere, just stay at home and study hard. You know best what your grades are like.\u201dXie Yu said: \u201cNo need. My grades are just like that. Don\u2019t waste your time.\u201dGu Xuelan: \u201cI arranged for you to go overseas and you didn\u2019t want to. You stayed in the country, but now look at what you do all day. Just like a pile of wet mud that can\u2019t even be used to patch up a wall. Tell me, what are you going to do?!\u201dThe car slowly entered the underground garage. This was a private bungalow surrounded by green hills and blue water. It had rained several days ago and the humidity hadn\u2019t cleared. Wet air rushed toward his face.Xie Yu opened the car door and got out, replying, \u201cMy own matters\u2014I know what I\u2019ll do about them.\u201dGu Xuelan was infuriated beyond endurance by his attitude. The driver coaxed, \u201cHe\u2019s in his rebellious phase. He\u2019s a boy, it\u2019s inevitable. Edges sharp enough to cut. My boy was like that before, too. After it\u2019s over, it gets better. He\u2019ll come around.\u201dGu Xuelan sat in the car. She rubbed her temple and couldn\u2019t say a word.\u2014\u2014You\u2019re really something, Boss Xie. You said you\u2019d come to see me and you went to the police station instead. I\u2019m really so damn touched.\u2014\u2014Are you out of the station yet? Do you need the guys to come bail you out?The message was from Lei-zi.Xie Yu looked down and read his messages as he entered the house.He was busy changing and didn\u2019t have the time to type, so he just called instead.At this time of day Lei-zi should still be helping out at the barbecue stall.As expected, when the call connected it wasn\u2019t Lei-zi\u2019s voice that first reached his ear but an unknown voice saying, \u201cAnother ten sticks of lamb.\u201d\u201cComing right up, table three, ten sticks of lamb.\u201dLei-zi pulled off his apron, bent at the waist, and slipped out the back door. \u201cBoss Xie, are you all right? Are you home? Damn, this police station is so easy to get into. Your temper is just as explosive as it was ten years ago.\u201dXie Yu had just taken off his t-shirt and his upper body was bare. \u201cWhat could have happened to me? Also, find someone to keep an eye on that Gou-ge. I\u2019m worried he\u2019ll pester Aunt Mei again.\u201d(T/N: Gou-ge: big brother Dog. He forgot Hu-ge (Big bro Tiger)\u2019s name.)\u201cGou-ge?\u201d Lei-zi thought about it for a bit and came to a realization. \u201cYou mean that Hu-ge?\u201dXie Yu: \u201cSame difference.\u201dLei-zi: \u201cIt\u2019s a very big difference.\u201dLei-zi kept asking: \u201cYou were always like that, couldn\u2019t remember people\u2019s names. Do you still remember my name?\u201dXie Yu: \u201cZhou Da Lei. What\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d\u201cGood that you remember. I keep thinking that with a personality like yours, you might really have forgotten.\u201dLei-zi found a small plastic stool and sat down. He pulled a Chunghwa cigarette from his pocket and put it in his mouth before continuing, \u201cAunt Mei doesn\u2019t need my protection. More like she protects me. At most I\u2019m the little prince of a barbecue stall. She\u2019s the one with the big reputation, the eldest sister of Black Water Street.\u201dXie Yu sensed there was something between the lines. \u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYou left early so you didn\u2019t see. Aunt Mei found someone and dug up all his history. All those things about going to prison and killing someone, it\u2019s all hot air. He just stole something and was caught by the owner of the house on the spot\u2026 I think he won\u2019t be able to go on \u2018doing business\u2019 in Black Water Street. How will the protection fees be nearly as good now?\u201dXie Yu put his phone on his bed and prepared to change his pants.Lei-zi kept talking. Maybe because it was lonely smoking alone, he suddenly grew thoughtful: \u201cThinking about it now, it was very good when the few of us were together. But I\u2019m happy for you now, too. The Zhong family is doing so well in A City. A branch of the company has even reached B City. Ever since your mom took you with her when she married into the family\u2026 you don\u2019t have to worry about food or the clothes on your back. You don\u2019t have to keep running away from debt collectors like before, either.\u201dXie Yu didn\u2019t continue to take off his pants any more. He let go and fell onto his bed. The light hanging from the ceiling was so bright it was dizzying. He wasn\u2019t sure if he was talking to Lei-zi or himself: \u201cIs that so.\u201dIt was noisy on Lei-zi\u2019s end and he didn\u2019t hear what Xie Yu said at all. He sucked in a final mouthful of smoke and got up: \u201cBoss Xie, I won\u2019t nag you any longer. Table three is waiting and, damn it, they dared to smash the table. Careful I don\u2019t scoop out the ashes and rub them on his face\u2026\u201dThe call cut off.Xie Yu lay on his bed in a daze.A moment later he scratched his head and was about to get up and go to shower when he found a hard little square in his trouser pocket. When he pulled it out he saw it was a flyer\u2014the flirtatious porn ad he hadn\u2019t thrown away earlier.Unexpectedly, the material it was promoting wasn\u2019t pornography. He glimpsed three bolded words in big black font: Question King Tournament.Xie Yu raised an eyebrow. This bait-and-switch tactic was quite novel.He turned the flyer over.On the other side was written: Here are the newest and most complete Olympiad questions, the most thrilling arena massacres. The questions encompass literature, mathematics, English, biology, chemistry, and physics. Over a hundred professors painstakingly wrote these questions. An addictive experience you\u2019ll never expect. No such thing as most difficult. Only more difficult.You! Will you be the long-awaited Question King?Mysterious, isn\u2019t it! Thrilling, isn\u2019t it! Big brother~ ah~ come~Xie Yu: \u2026\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She took off her shawl and handed it to the maid. \u201cIs dinner ready?\u201dThe maid took the shawl from her. \u201cJust as you instructed, it\u2019s ready. All dishes the second young master likes. Will you eat now?\u201dGu Xuelan\u2019s high heels stepped on the marble floor. The chandelier reflected in the floor was bright and eye-catching, making it seem as if she was stepping on light. She walked another two steps then halted. She retreated, turned, and walked in the opposite direction, leaving behind a sentence: \u201cGo upstairs and call him.\u201dXie Yu was in the bathroom, his body thoroughly soaked. Water ran from the top of his head along the strands of his hair and dripped down, the hot steam misting the glass doors on all four sides.The phone he had left beside the sink vibrated.He shut his eyes and washed away the last of the foam on his body, then heard two knocks at the door. Immediately after, the maid\u2019s tentative and restrained voice came muffled through the door. \u201cSecond young master, it\u2019s dinner time.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not hungry.\u201d\u201cThat\u2026 but madam has already\u2026\u201dXie Yu opened his eyes and repeated: \u201cI\u2019m not hungry and can\u2019t eat.\u201dA-Fang had been with the Zhong family less than two years, not a long time. She was still hesitant when she spoke or did anything, as if afraid of making the smallest mistake. When she first arrived, even before meeting anyone, she had already heard many rumors about the Zhong family.It was said that the original Mrs. Zhong had killed herself. Not even a few years later, Big Boss Zhong had brought another woman home. The name Gu Xuelan wasn\u2019t recognized by anyone, and when she came she even dragged an oil container\u00b9 along with her. One big and one small. The woman sat on Mrs. Zhong\u2019s throne, and fairly securely at that; no matter how others laughed at her, she hadn\u2019t fallen off.The Zhong family\u2019s eldest young master was pitiful. Not only had he lost his mother, he now had to watch someone else enter the house.When A-Fang went back to deliver Xie Yu\u2019s message, she didn\u2019t know what to say. She stood next to the table with her head bowed and couldn\u2019t say a word.Seeing her demeanor, Gu Xuelan understood what had happened. She picked up her chopsticks. As she spoke, she herself wasn\u2019t sure if she cared as little as she seemed to. \u201cWhether he wants to eat or not, he\u2019ll get hungry\u2026 You may go.\u201dXie Yu put on his clothes, his hair still dripping water. He wanted to see how much of that mysterious game had downloaded, but when he picked up his phone he only saw text message notifications. At a glance, he couldn\u2019t find the game\u2019s download progress bar at all.A group chat titled, \u201cDon\u2019t just fight and kill,\u201d showed over 99 push notifications.[Barbecue Stall Prince \u2013 Lei] : My god, he\u2019d better know what\u2019s good for him. If I run into him again, I\u2019ll beat him up every time I see him.[Lei\u2019s Dad] Good boy! You have spirit![Lei\u2019s Mom]: Beat him until he can\u2019t get up! He\u2019s been so arrogant for these past few months. He really thought he\u2019s a big brother.\u2026\u2026Zhou Dalei\u2019s family members were really all alike.Xie Yu scrolled up. The content was more or less the same.Hu-ge had already been set straight by everyone\u2019s collective effort, but he still had to subject his corpse to whipping by the Black Water Street Citizens\u2019 group chat.Black Water Street had undergone continuous expansion for a few years and people had come and gone. Many new households had moved in. This chat group mostly consisted of residents of the old neighborhoods who had been here more than ten years: a few dozen people who were as close as family.Lei-zi used to complain to him a lot that ever since this chat group was set up, there was no privacy at all.When he skipped class to go to an internet cafe, the internet cafe\u2019s boss had laughed and said, \u201cThe world\u2019s only as big as your courage! I appreciate your courage. You\u2019re not like the other kids.\u201d Then he turned around and posted an HD portrait of Lei-zi holding the mouse and logging into the game, and mentioned Lei\u2019s Dad and Lei\u2019s Mom with the addendum: Your son didn\u2019t go to class and came to play games again!Lei-zi\u2019s dad and mom had immediately left their work at the stall, barged into the internet cafe, and chased Lei-zi down three whole blocks.Xie Yu was drying his hair with a towel when someone mentioned him out of nowhere.[Barbecue Stall Prince \u2013 Lei] @XY, what do you think? I thought about it all night instead of sleeping and I still think that idiot got off easy.He just had to drag Xie Yu into it. Would the topic please just end? Xie Yu typed a few words back.[XY]: Don\u2019t drag me into this. I\u2019m an upstanding citizen.[Barbecue Stall Prince \u2013 Lei] : \u2026\u2026[Barbecue Stall Prince \u2013 Lei] You\u2019re really shameless. Where were you thinking about being an upstanding citizen when you were beating someone up?!Question King Tournament had successfully installed.Xie Yu had a bit more interest in this Question King Tournament, so he neatly ended the conversation: I\u2019m dropping this conversation, Barbecue Prince, and going to play games.The two had different understandings of the word \u2018game.\u2019 Zhou Dalei also liked to play games: whether it was Match Up or League of Legends, he loved them all and wasn\u2019t picky. He did have some talent for games. Once, he had been the glorious top League player on Black Water Street whom people couldn\u2019t beat no matter how hard they tried.So the Barbecue Stall Prince immediately perked up and sent Xie Yu a private message: What game, a new Chicken King Wars? Let\u2019s VC?[XY] No.[XY] Don\u2019t ask, you can\u2019t.[XY] You can\u2019t play it.The three dots of silence.An explosion.[Barbecue Stall Prince \u2013 Lei] : Don\u2019t tell a man he can\u2019t. Tell me what it is. If you have guts, tell me. I, your big bro, will get onto the leaderboard in a minute.Zhou Dalei put out his cigarette and prepared to meet this battle between men. But when he saw the game interface Xie Yu sent over\u2014if that could even be called a game\u2014he felt as if he had been struck by lightning. He was dazed. With trembling hands he deleted the brutal words he had previously sent.Then he hit the voice message button and replied, \u201cWhat the hell is this!\u201dHell Math, Huanggang Real Questions, Flower English, BioChemPhys All Together\u2026 this was a virus, surely.\u201cIs this a game? Can this be a game? What exactly do you not understand about the word \u2018game?\u2019\u201d Zhou Dalei\u2019s heart was pierced a thousand times and hurt like it had received ten thousand thorns. In the end he could only ask, from the depths of his soul, \u201cIs this fun?!\u201d[XY] I don\u2019t know. It\u2019ll do, probably.[Barbecue Stall Prince \u2013 Lei] : \u2026\u2026The total number of online players in Question King was less than four hundred. It was unpopular and its interface was simple and ugly; it gave off the atmosphere of risking shutdown at any time.Upon entry, players encountered a test made up of random questions. They had to accumulate a certain amount of points before they could enter the second level: endless question mode, and one-on-one PK.This game did have some frills: in the lower left corner was a small box and a scrollbar, a chat function which encouraged communication between players. But the contents of this communication\u2026\u201cTopTenInClass\u201d said to \u201cEnglishClassRep\u201d: Let\u2019s compare points. I\u2019ll give you back this humiliation.\u201cEnglishClassRep\u201d said to \u201cTopTenInClass\u201d: Interesting. Is that fun? If you have that much mental energy, you might as well go memorize some more English vocabulary. Your English\u2014pardon my frankness\u2014you don\u2019t even have the lexicon of an eighth grader. If your vocabulary is stuck at the fourth grade level, you don\u2019t have a future. You should reflect on yourself.\u201cTheBeautyOfChineseCulture\u201d: Memorize what English? When one is tired, come to the Oceans of Chinese Culture to rest and recuperate. Classical Chinese PK, self-explanatory. Double experience. Room 24008, wait for your fated person.\u201cILoveStudying\u201d: Game God, please explain question 13 on booklet B? Is zero or negative one not the solution? Are the limits on the function wrong?\u201cStudystudystudythatsallIdo\u201d : Will pay high price for a set of the 40th Anniversary Limited Edition edition of \u201cBeat the Gaokao:\u00b2 The Mock Exam Most Worth Doing.\u201d I went to all the bookstores and couldn\u2019t get it. Because I couldn\u2019t do this mock exam, I can\u2019t eat and I lost twenty kg. My heart hurts. The Beat the Gaokao series is my favourite mock exam, how can I not have the limited edition!!!\u2026\u2026Xie Yu was the 399th registered player. This game really was unpopular; the system warmly welcomed him in a little message box for a full two minutes, then enthusiastically predicted his future for him: Drift freely in the ocean of knowledge and fight hard to build a beautiful new China. Tsinghua and Peking University\u00b3 are waving to you.Xie Yu clicked in and did a mock exam.The system messages were still rolling: Welcome user [jsdhwdmaX] to the Question King Tournament family!At this time, the players online hadn\u2019t realized that this newbie, whose account name seemed to have come from rubbing his face against his keyboard, would bring a massacre of blood, wind, and rain in the summer vacation to come.Zhou Dalei also did a mock exam, refusing to back down until he hit the southern wall.\u2074 In the answer box for every question he scrawled only two crooked words: Don\u2019t know.The result was obvious.He hit the \u2018submit paper\u2019 button in the upper right corner and was informed that his score was too low and he was not eligible for admission to the game lobby.Zhou Dalei almost threw his phone: Discrimination! Discrimination against bad students! What kind of broken game is this? I\u2019m a king in the digital arena! You don\u2019t even let me in the game lobby? If I can\u2019t do \u2019em, I can\u2019t do \u2019em! So what if I can\u2019t do the questions? At least I\u2019m honest!By the time Xie Yu had finished doing the questions, he had received more than ten messages from Barbecue Prince.-Scoundrel!-How is this solved? Is this really meant for humans to do?-Complaint! I\u2019m lodging a complaint!\u2026\u2026Xie Yu\u2019s finger tapped lightly on the screen several times as he formed his sentence carefully. He was about to hit send, but Zhou Dalei sent another message: How many points did you get?How many points?Xie Yu sat on the carpet with his back to the side of his bed and deleted the words he had just written, one at a time.[XY] About the same as you.[XY] Rubbish game. Uninstalled already.Zhou Dalei had a cigarette in his mouth. He squatted by the box and contemplated life. An apron encircled his waist, Fang Bao Lai Sunflower Seed Oil written on it in red cursive. One could tell at a glance that it was a \u2018buy two get one free\u2019 piece from the supermarket\u2019s big clearance sale.He wasn\u2019t bad-looking. His features were proportional and somewhat rascally, and he was just a little dark. Right now, it was the way he squatted that made him look even more like a hooligan.His mom passed by holding a tray. Seeing him deflated like this, she picked up a foot and kicked him. Zhou Dalei\u2019s butt took a direct hit. \u201cWhat are you doing squatting here! Have you finished grilling the lamb?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going, I\u2019m going.\u201dZhou Dalei hurriedly stood up and had only taken two steps when he thought of something and turned back to say: \u201cIn a while, mom, I want to ask you something.\u201dHis mom replied smoothly: \u201cDon\u2019t know, no money, loved before.\u201d\u201dCan you be serious. I was going to ask you, do you remember that in junior high, Xie Yu\u2019s grades were really good and he even represented our street in a math competition and won a prize. And when we were little and had a Rubik\u2019s cube, he could do it even with his eyes closed. He was so good at it\u2026\u201dHis mom put the dirty dishes in the sink. \u201cSo what? Your mom, too. When I was small, I got full marks in all my exams, and in the end I still got lost. People get worse with time, too. Like you. Look at you now.\u201dZhou Dalei tried to capture the vaguely formed notion in his mind. \u201cNo\u2014Mom, I really think that that\u2019s not\u2026 also, what\u2019s up with me now? I think I\u2019m quite good-looking.\u201d\u201cGood-looking my ass. Get rid of those messy colors on your head first.\u201d His mom began lecturing. \u201cKids these days just want to play. They\u2019re all smart too, they just don\u2019t spend time on studying. Like A-Jie from next door, his grades used to be rock bottom, but after he got out of the hospital he jumped ahead about a hundred places in the mock exams. I think you also need a car accident to clear your brain. All you know how to do is play games all day\u2026\u201d\u201cTwenty lamb kebabs, right? I\u2019m going.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Not long after falling asleep, he was awoken by the sound of something breaking downstairs.It was the crisp and earsplitting sound of ceramic shattering against the ground.Accompanying the sound of shattering were familiar angry shouts. The person\u2019s tone held the bone-deep pride of someone who had grown accustomed to holding a high position for many long years: \u201cThis is my house! All of you get out\u2014pack up and get out! Remove your dirty hands! Who allowed you to touch me? You think you\u2019re fit to\u2014\u201dXie Yu removed his eye mask but did not open his eyes; his temple faintly throbbed.\u201cEldest young master, I\u2019ve made some soup to help you sober up. Drink some.\u201d It was A-Fang\u2019s voice, deferential. \u201cYou\u2019ve drunk too much\u2026\u201dThere was a muffled thud from something else being thrown, then the person\u2019s shouting became more and more shrill: \u201cI said get lost, all of you get lost! All you lower-class people, do you not understand human words?!\u201d\u201cOh, look at my memory. I almost forgot. This house doesn\u2019t have a place for me to speak, right? Instead, certain people who aren\u2019t surnamed Zhong still think so highly of themselves.\u201dXie Yu tossed and turned on the bed. Finally, he sat up in frustration and cursed: \u201cFuck.\u201dThree years.It had been three years but this ugly scene was just the same as it had been then.Three years ago when Gu Xuelan married the famous entrepreneur of A City, Zhong Guofei, the news had spread quickly throughout the city. Not only Gu Xuelan, but Xie Yu, too, was subjected to all kinds of nasty speculation.The rumors spread as if they were truth.Countless onlookers, who had just come to see a show and didn\u2019t mind things getting out of hand, went ahead and wrote countless \u2018biographies\u2019 of his life. The most eye-catching among them was that of \u2018the third party and her illegitimate kid.\u2019Xie Yu had personally experienced many years of evading debt collectors and wondering where his next meal would come from, and had not even been able to pay his school fees for more than half a year. Otherwise, even he might have believed those endless ugly stories.No matter which of the stories about this mother-son duo was the true one, Zhong Jie, who was Zhong Guofei\u2019s biological son, couldn\u2019t accept it. He didn\u2019t care what the truth was, either.He only knew the facts laid out in front of his eyes: after losing his mother, someone was trying to snatch away everything he owned, including the most important thing.His inheritance rights.After a long time, it finally grew quiet downstairs. For better or worse, the eldest young master Zhong was being helped back to his room. Xie Yu leaned against the headboard and listened to the sound of them closing the door to Zhong Jie\u2019s room, their light sighs as they passed by his own door, and their footsteps as they walked back downstairs.Xie Yu\u2019s eyes were open; he was thinking.Out of nowhere he felt thirsty.It was as if a ball of fire was burning upwards through his internal organs until it reached his throat.Gu Xuelan sat on the sofa in the living room, her eyes desolate. Her lace dressing-gown swept the floor. When she saw Xie Yu come down she glanced up only slightly, as if she was very tired. \u201cYou\u2019re downstairs? Did we wake you?\u201dXie Yu had guessed she would be here. He wanted to say, \u2018How many times have I told you? If he wants to throw a fit, let him be. It\u2019s none of your business.\u2019 But seeing her like this, he forced the words back down his throat and said in a lukewarm voice, \u201cHappy now?\u201dGu Xuelan: \u201c\u2026His mother\u2019s death anniversary is in two days.\u201dXie Yu: \u201cSo you stood there for an hour and let him yell at you.\u201dGu Xuelan said nothing.Xie Yu\u2019s voice held no emotion, but his words grew thornier with each sentence: \u201cHis mom\u2014did you kill her? His dad\u2014did you stealnatch him? If he wants to yell so much, let him yell. But you even went so far as to help him out. You\u2019re quite encouraging.\u201dBy this time Gu Xuelan was not nearly as tough as she had been in the car before. She sighed lightly. \u201cDon\u2019t say that.\u201dXie Yu replied, \u201cNo one owes him anything. Doesn\u2019t he realize that?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dXie Yu went to the kitchen and poured two cups of milk. He handed one to Gu Xuelan and said, doing his best to keep his voice amiable: \u201cMom, drink this and go and rest. It\u2019s late.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll pretend I didn\u2019t hear any of this tonight. Next time, if you stand there and let him shout at you, I\u2019ll beat him until he can\u2019t speak.\u201d\u201dI\u2019m a person of my word.\u201dGu Xuelan took the cup.Gu Xuelan was stunned for a moment. The boy standing in front of her\u2014she hadn\u2019t realized he had gotten so tall.The youth took after her in looks. His appearance should make him look feminine, but something fierce, cold, and sharp had at some point overtaken his features. He looked like someone hard to get close to, and even she, his mother, felt that he was a stranger.Her eyes finally landed on Xie Yu\u2019s hair, where some strands were still sticking up from sleep. The strands were still so soft, just like when he was young.She momentarily wasn\u2019t sure what to say. By the time she recovered, Xie Yu had already turned and gone upstairs.Xie Yu had always had trouble sleeping, and even milk didn\u2019t help. He had been sleeping soundly before; now that he had been awakened, he couldn\u2019t go back to sleep no matter how he tried.He glanced at the pitch-black night outside the window and suddenly wanted to know what time it was.He had intended only to look at the time, but after he got hold of his phone all drowsiness completely vanished.[Barbecue Stall Prince \u2013 Lei] : Fuck it, I\u2019m not playing any more! [Image][Barbecue Stall Prince \u2013 Lei] : This time I\u2019m really quitting! [Image][Barbecue Stall Prince \u2013 Lei] : Last time! If I play again I\u2019m a pig! [Image]Two hours ago, Zhou Dalei had sent three screenshots in quick succession, all saying: Score too low. You cannot enter the game lobby, oh~ Please answer more carefully.Xie Yu wrote a line of text and hit reply. You really think heaven will be moved by the persistence of a professional zero-scorer?Zhou Dalei had probably long since gone to sleep and Xie Yu had no intention of waiting for his reply. After exiting the app, he hesitated between two options: to keep on pretending to be a corpse or to play a certain strange little game. Then he tapped on the app with the Apple of Knowledge icon.Respected user [jsdhwdmaX], welcome back to Question King~ You scored full marks on your placement test. Please tap to continue and enter the game lobby!It was 3 a.m. but this game was still very lively.\u201cIlovestudying\u201d: Anyone want to come to a private room and PK math mode? Waiting for a fated person.\u201cMyGoalIsBalancedSubjects\u201d: For the Math C paper, is question three actually a wrong question? Is it wrong or am I wrong?\u201cFightingUpstream\u201d: \u2026\u2026It\u2019s so late. You all aren\u2019t sleeping?\u201cStudystudystudythatsallIdo\u201d: Sleep? What sleep? Do you know how many people will surpass you if you sleep just a minute earlier?\u201cForABetterTomorrow\u201d: Study-bro is right. Life\u2019s so short and the time we have to learn is extremely precious. If we sleep, we\u2019re wasting this wonderful time.\u201cIlovestudying\u201d: My thirst for knowledge leaves me unable to fall asleep. When I sleep, it\u2019s like I\u2019m dead. My brain stops thinking. What\u2019s more terrifying than not thinking?\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dXie Yu suddenly felt that he, who had opened this game again, was also crazy.The topic quickly switched from sleep to something else.\u201cStudystudystudythatsallIdo\u201d: Speaking of which, that guy ranked first. Did anyone ever knock him off it? He\u2019s been an eyesore for a long time. How can somebody be that shameless?The moment these words emerged, a surprising amount of lurkers emerged.\u201cTopTenInClass\u201d: Shameless +1!\u201cEnglishClassRep\u201d: Shameless +2!!\u201cMydreamistobeaschoolprincipal\u201d: Shameless +3!!!\u2026\u2026The atmosphere was lively and the thoughts of the players were as one.Ranked first, shameless?Xie Yu was actually curious\u2014a rare occurrence.The leaderboard was on the top right corner of the page. He tapped in. It was a simple, shabby list. And the one in first place\u2026\u201cDamn.\u201d Xie Yu glanced at the two words beside the little gold trophy and momentarily wasn\u2019t sure what to say aside from, \u201cDamn.\u201dFirst place: Question King.Signature: No need to fight. Victory is mine.Seven short words, arrogant yet polite.In a game called Question King Tournament, he called himself Question King?Many people had likely gone to ask customer service if this \u2018Question King\u2019 was a player or a bot, because the app had even made a note beside the name in first place: Don\u2019t ask. This is a player. This is really a player. If you don\u2019t believe it, challenge him orz.Perhaps Xie Yu was frustrated at not being able to sleep, or maybe he wanted to find something to pass the time. Of course, he was internally already a little annoyed at this Question King.Out of boredom, Xie Yu opened endless mode.He thought: As long as it\u2019s only in this game and no one knows\u2026 it should be fine.Everyone knew that Xie Yu\u2019s grades were crap.Not only did he get bad grades, he also constantly got into fights. His rebellious phase had arrived aggressively and even Gu Xuelan had forgotten that even just three years ago he hadn\u2019t been like that at all.In his first year of junior high, Xie Yu even constantly brought trophies home.Gu Xuelan didn\u2019t know the importance of those trophies, and Xie Yu wasn\u2019t the type who liked to brag, so he always glossed over it: \u201cSmall competition. Not a lot of participants.\u201dThe month before Gu Xuelan decided to marry Zhong Guofei, she took Xie Yu and moved out of their basement apartment. That day, Zhong Guofei had employed a moving company to help. He was already past forty and had the meticulous manner of a businessman: all his workwas impeccable, yet held a personal touch.was watertight, yet personal. He had stood in the damp and dark basement apartment and eventually stopped in front of a wall. He bent down and the laugh lines at the corners of his eyes grew more prominent as he smiled and asked, \u201cXiao Yu, all these awards are yours?\u201dOnce Xie Yu started doing the questions, he couldn\u2019t stop. His painstakingly awoken competitiveness now thoroughly quashed all desire to sleep. Without rest or sleep, he did questions for several nights in a row and managed to squeeze into the top three on the leaderboard.At mealtime, Gu Xuelan came upstairs to call him. The reply she got was always: \u201cI\u2019ll eat later, just leave it there.\u201d\u201cWhat have you been doing cooped up in your room these two days?\u201d Gu Xuelan stood in the doorway, keeping a tight rein on her temper.Xie Yu was quite honest: \u201cMe? Playing a game.\u201d\u201cYou have the cheek to say that\u2026 The home tutor I got is coming over tomorrow. You\u2019d better clean up your act, do you hear me?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t hear you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dGu Xuelan was brimming with anger. When she returned to the dining room, Zhong Guofei smiled and put a piece of fish on her plate: \u201cDon\u2019t be angry. The boy\u2019s still young and it\u2019s usual to want to have fun. Try this\u2014I got someone to fly it over from Hokkaido, fresh. Last time in the restaurant you seemed to like this, so I got Old Xu to watch out for it.\u201dZhong Guofei put down his chopsticks and watched her eat, then raised a hand to tidy her hair. \u201cIf you\u2019re so angry, you\u2019ll end up getting sick and I\u2019m the one who will be heartbroken.\u201dGu Xuelan smiled and glanced at him, then sighed. \u201cI hope.\u201dRecently, something really had been off with Xie Yu.Quite a few times, Zhou Dalei had seen the messages his big bro had sent to the friend group in the middle of the night. The contents were all quite strange, as if he wasn\u2019t quite in his right mind.For example, tonight\u2019s message from 4:23am.XY: Someone, slap me awake. [/Smile]Zhou Dalei was playing a game where a new tournament had started and he needed to earn points. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t be checking his friend group messages because of his boredom at this time.The atmosphere in the internet cafe was even more lively than during the day. Several containers of cup noodles surrounded the keyboard. Zhou Dalei blew out a smoke ring and pressed the cigarette butt into the ashtray before adding a message: Have you been drinking?Xie Yu replied: I don\u2019t drink. Fake alcohol is dangerous.Zhou Dalei replied: Listening to you\u2026 Bro, I\u2019m gonna guess. Have you\u2026 fallen into the abyss of love?Xie Yu replied: Love, my ass.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Bets, anyone? I think this X is definitely a late bloomer. Dark horse among dark horses. And up till now he hasn\u2019t said anything. High and mighty to the end. Can tell at a glance that he\u2019s someone who does great things. Not a simple person.\u201cForABetterTomorrow\u201d: What shall we wager?\u201cServeTheHomeland\u201d: I wager a personal treasure. The fifth textbook, \u201cLanguage,\u201d from 1982\u2019s middle school curriculum. You can only come across something like this by luck.\u201cIlovestudying\u201d: He must be someone who spends all his time studying. Looks like he does nothing but study all day, so neither glory nor humiliation fazes him. He doesn\u2019t concern himself with any other entertainment. I feel extremely ashamed to even have the spare time to be chitchatting here.Xie Yu had done questions for a good few nights. After getting onto the leaderboard, the user \u2018jsdhwdmaX\u2019 had become a hot conversation topic people didn\u2019t tire of.To this group of players who loved to study, the leaderboard was like their class ranking. It was a symbol of glory and the goal to which they aspired. In their daily lives, they strove to become top students and encouraged themselves to follow in the footsteps of top students: read more, see more, memorize more, and do more.\u00b9A player\u2019s overall score in Question King Tournament was determined by their average score in the various subjects, so it was useless to only be good in one subject. The names on the leaderboards were all all-rounders, and the ranking had almost never changed since the beginning of the game.In a single night, a newcomer had rushed up. This name, which was impossible to remember, was even changing its position on the leaderboard every day: he effortlessly climbed upwards, as if climbing a ladder.\u201cStudystudystudythatsallIdo\u201d: High and mighty, alright. Shameless already cast a long shadow in my heart. Now every time I see the system announcing someone PKing someone and losing, I\u2019m just afraid the next words in the chat are going to be, \u201c1 kill.\u201d\u201cEnglishClassRep\u201d: His record is 14 kills in a night. I feel like he\u2019s playing the wrong game [/tears running down face]\u201cForABetterTomorrow\u201d: Damn, he\u2019s really that annoying? After PKing someone, he says in the chat, \u201c1 kill 2 kills 3 kills?\u201d Is he the Shameless I know?\u201cEnglishClassRep\u201d: It\u2019s him. Who else could it be? To tell the truth, I really want to know what he\u2019s trying to achieve by doing this.\u201cStudystudystudythatsallIdo\u201d: I don\u2019t know. How can mortals like us understand?\u201dIlovestudying\u201d: Of all things, the most important is studying. Gossip is meaningless. Everyone, look at top student X. Come to room 4008. Waiting for your challenge.The Question King hadn\u2019t come online very often after securing his territory, but his legend had still spread throughout the game.Xie Yu occasionally glanced at the chat, and each time his understanding of \u2018Shameless\u2019 was renewed. So many tricks? This crazy person.He did questions until it was past 2 a.m. and accepted several PK battles. After getting his points, he prepared to log off and go to sleep.He had only slept several hours before being called awake at seven in the morning by Gu Xuelan. \u201cThe tutor is almost here! Tidy up, tidy up and wash up, then come down and eat breakfast. Quickly.\u201dShe said the first few sentences normally, but by the end she saw Xie Yu\u2019s uncooperative attitude and grew angry again. \u201cDid you hear me?\u201dXie Yu got a headache from her shouting: \u201c\u2026Got it.\u201dGu Xuelan was a woman of her word and had really hired a tutor. This person had quite a reputation in the world of private tutoring and had cured many wayward youth. All in all, he was talked up as if he were a god and there wasn\u2019t a student he couldn\u2019t teach. He had a pair of hands that could turn rot into miracles, stones into gold, and discover the hidden intelligence in every child\u2026Xie Yu wanted to laugh when he heard it. He wanted to laugh mockingly.But Gu Xuelan was very hopefully anticipating this tutor\u2019s arrival. This woman, who usually rigidly controlled her food intake to preserve her figure, had even eaten a few more bites of breakfast out of happiness. \u201cI heard Madam Chen\u2019s son\u2019s grades improved a few dozen points in a summer.\u201dZhong Guofei smiled and said to Xie Yu, \u201cDid you hear that? Work hard and don\u2019t disappoint your mother.\u201dXie Yu was focused on eating his congee. He didn\u2019t even raise his head and just said, \u201cMm,\u201d in acknowledgement so the matter would be over.But someone wasn\u2019t happy.Zhong Jie sat opposite Xie Yu and said in a lukewarm voice: \u201cPeople are different. Just because someone else\u2019s son\u2019s grades got better by a few dozen marks doesn\u2019t mean your son\u2019s will, too. Don\u2019t give him too much pressure. If he can\u2019t, he can\u2019t.\u201dThe moment these words emerged, the atmosphere at the table, which had been cordial until now, instantly dropped to freezing point.Gu Xuelan awkwardly put down the soup ladle and wasn\u2019t sure what to say.\u201cCan you speak?\u201dXie Yu leisurely finished his congee, then looked up, looked into Zhong Jie\u2019s eyes and repeated, \u201cCan you speak?\u201dGu Xuelan hurriedly tugged at Xie Yu\u2019s clothes.The words, \u201cNone of your business,\u201d were on the tip of Xie Yu\u2019s tongue, but in the end he didn\u2019t say them.\u201dAm I wrong?\u201d Zhong Jie smiled wider and wider. \u201cYou cheated on the high school entrance exams. Are you going to cheat on the university entrance exams too?\u201dIf not for Gu Xuelan restraining him, Xie Yu would have put Zhong Jie in the hospital\u2014the sort of \u2018landing in the hospital\u2019 that meant he\u2019d be bedridden for a month and not be able to take care of daily life matters.Zhong Jie looked very similar to Zhong Guofei, but how they treated people and things were poles apart. Zhong Jie always did things with acrimony and meanness.He was about to enter university. His grades weren\u2019t good enough for a top-tier school, but Zhong Guofei had connections. Even though he was more than ten points short, Zhong Guofei had still gotten him into Nanjing University. This placement gave him the pride and confidence of \u201cA student of a famous university.\u201d\u201cHow I do on the university entrance exams is nothing you need to be concerned about.\u201d Xie Yu wiped his mouth and stood up. He walked several steps before stopping to ask again, \u201cRight, have you eaten your fill?\u201dZhong Jie wasn\u2019t sure what he meant by this.Xie Yu continued, \u201cIf you\u2019ve eaten your fill, I hope you can find something to do.\u201dZhong Jie: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Was Xie Yu insulting him by saying he squanders his energy on pointless things?\u00b2In the end, the meal ended on an unhappy note.After the meal, Zhong Jie and Zhong Guofei left the house together to go to work. Gu Xuelan stayed at home to wait for the private tutor and took the chance to talk to Xie Yu. \u201cAlthough that kid Xiao Jie wasn\u2019t right, you still shouldn\u2019t talk to him like that.\u201d\u201cThat kid?\u201d Xie Yu said, \u201cIf that person is a kid, then surely so am I?\u201dGu Xuelan wasn\u2019t sure how to continue either. She simply didn\u2019t want the house to be full of drawn swords and notched arrows all the time. \u201cYou\u2026 you\u2019re already familiar with what his personality is like. Just bear with it. If you take a step back, things will be much easier to resolve.\u201dXie Yu was so annoyed he couldn\u2019t take it. \u201cBased on what? He has a dogshit temper and I still have to put up with him?\u201d\u201cYour Uncle Zhong has already reprimanded him. Be politer next time. Your mom is begging you, all right? Most of the time you live at school anyway and Mom can\u2019t see you even if she wants to. Now that you\u2019re back home for the holidays, be good and listen to me.\u201dAs she spoke, the doorbell rang.The home tutor stood in the doorway holding a black briefcase. He was young, with gold-rimmed spectacles, and had the bearing of a good man. \u201cMadam Zhong, young master Zhong.\u201dSeeing he had arrived, Gu Xuelan ended the conversation, got up, and went to the hall to welcome the guest. The two sat on the sofa and chatted for a while about Xie Yu\u2019s bad grades among other things.Xie Yu sat opposite them, extremely bored, and picked several grapes from the coffee table.The home tutor was surnamed Huang, had graduated from a reputed university, and spoke eloquently about educational matters. Xie Yu had almost begun to believe that Mr. Huang\u2019s legendary power of turning rock into gold was really something special, but he hadn\u2019t imagined that it would be extremely boring. He started to get sleepy after listening for a while.\u201cInterest is a student\u2019s best teacher. My pedagogical philosophy is to lead students to develop an interest in learning. When they are interested in learning of their own accord, then one can teach according to the student\u2019s need, and help the student by finding the study method that best suits him. After finding the right study method, the work becomes much easier, achieving double the results with half the effort.\u201dThe hair on Mr. Huang\u2019s head was coated in a thick layer of hair gel and he had a habit of using his fingers to push up his spectacles when he spoke.The grapes were sweet and sour. Xie Yu picked up a tissue to spit the seeds out.He surreptitiously opened his phone messages and located Lei-zi. While Gu Xuelan and the teacher were chatting up a storm, he one-handedly sent a text: Call me, quick.After many years of deep friendship, a text like that was instantly understood.Zhou Dalei\u2019s phone call came the next second.Xie Yu stood up: \u201cMom, Mr. Huang, I\u2019ll take this call outside.\u201dOn Zhou Dalei\u2019s end was the sound of a keyboard clacking. Xie Yu was about to say, \u201cYou\u2019re at an internet cafe, right?\u201d when he heard Dalei suck in a deep breath and then raise his voice, yelling righteously, \u201cFuck your grandpa! You steal my loot, I kill your whole family!\u201dXie Yu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dZhou Dalei cursed up a storm for a while, threw his mouse to the floor, and almost followed up with the keyboard. But the internet cafe boss hurried over: \u201cLei-zai, calm down, calm down. If you smash this, you\u2019ll have to pay for it. Things in games are temporary, just like clouds and smoke passing by. Take it easy. All sorts of things happen\u2026\u201d\u201dCan\u2019t calm down. Not done with this.\u201d Zhou Dalei was very stubborn. \u201cRelationships, go ahead and steal them. Limited edition violet weapon, no way.\u201dZhou Dalei now remembered that his phone was still connected to a call. \u201cBoss Xie? I tell you, I\u2019m so mad right now my balls hurt.\u201dXie Yu asked: \u201cLimited edition violet weapon?\u201d\u201cYeah! Our team killed this boss and the drop rate is only 0.1 per cent. We\u2019ve been grinding this secret boss for days now. Damn, it was right within our reach and then they snatched it from right under our noses,\u201d Zhou Dalei said. \u201cThis lot plays too dirty. Really damn dirty.\u201dZhou Dalei said, \u201cI challenged them to a duel to the death. Whoever doesn\u2019t show up is a grandson.\u00b3 Are you coming?\u201dXie Yu: \u201cI don\u2019t play your fantasy games.\u201d\u201cNot in a game. On Nanjing Street.\u201dHe can fucking invite them out just like this?Zhou Dalei: \u201cThey\u2019re in A City. We\u2019re in B City. I got a map, drew a line, and picked the center location. Two hours from now, the quad in the middle of Nanjing Street.\u201dXie Yu glanced back at Madam Gu who was still talking to the home tutor. \u201cAll right. Wait there and big bro will come support you.\u201dGu Xuelan and Mr. Huang had chatted for about twenty minutes. By the time she realized something was odd, Xie Yu had already left.He said he was taking a call, but it had been a long time since he left to take the call and he still hadn\u2019t come back.\u201cWhere is he?\u201dSeeing the madam\u2019s expression go dark, A-Fang hesitated and wasn\u2019t sure what to say: \u201c\u2026 L-left. Second young master said before he left to tell you not to waste your effort.\u201dGu Xuelan almost dropped the ceramic teacup in her hand.Xie Yu was the last to arrive.When he got to the central shopping center, the two groups of people had already formed two lines facing each other. From the looks of it, they were trying to hash things out first before fighting.More than a dozen people, quite a crowd.Xie Yu had no intention of fighting; he was only there to mind his own business. So he picked the most scenic spot, in the shade away from the sun, and hung around.It was a muggy and hot summer day, and the two groups of hot-blooded guys whose ages averaged fifteen or sixteen endured the 10:30am sun. For the sake of a piece of equipment in a game, both sides \u2018greeted\u2019 each other\u2019s whole families.\u2074Zhou Dalei took the lead. His voice was loud: \u201cYou still fucking dare talk? Was that equipment yours?\u201dThe opposite group didn\u2019t show weakness: \u201cIt\u2019s ours. How could it not be ours?\u201d\u201cHow shameless are you, big bro? It\u2019s just a game. Don\u2019t play so dirty.\u201d\u201cOpportunities are for the prepared. To get the goods, we hid there for three or four days. What do you know?!\u201d\u201cYo-hei, you\u2019re quite arrogant. Looking for a beating, are you?\u201d\u201cCome on then! Who\u2019s scared of who?!\u201dZhou Dalei was so mad he almost expired. He took a breath and grit out: \u201cYou\u2019d better hand it over while I can still talk to you calmly. Hand the goods over and I won\u2019t make things difficult for you. We\u2019ll treat this like it never happened.\u201dXie Yu observed someone in the crowd, who was originally standing at the back of the line and wearing a black mask, slowly walk forward. He stood out among the crowd. The people surrounding him cooperated smoothly to clear him a path.Through the cloth, that person\u2019s voice was muffled and low: \u201cWe got the equipment with our own skill. Why should we return it?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Written zhuo-yue, Zhao.They were just asking for a beating.Just listen to that self-righteous tone.The two lines of people immediately crashed together in a scuffle and fought relentlessly. Zhou Dalei wished he could strip off his shirt, bare his shoulders, and burn up all the energy in his body. Just show them what comes of pissing him off. \u201cYou steal my violet weapon, you steal my violet weapon, I\u2019ll let you steal my violet weapon!\u201d\u201cWe didn\u2019t steal anything! Is this considered stealing? If your skills aren\u2019t as good as ours then just admit it. Fuck, don\u2019t hit someone\u2019s face!\u201dAmidst the chaos\u2014With wide eyes, Xie Yu saw the masked teenager who had initiated the fight, and who emanated an aura of being the chief of this lot, quietly minding his own business. He gradually left the battlefield while minding his own business. His \u2018minding my own business\u2019 skill was very good; no one discovered him as he quietly left.As he left the arena, he even raised a hand to tidy his hair.Very concerned with appearances.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dOn this hot summer day, he wore long sleeves and pants, and even wore a mask so that his features couldn\u2019t be seen.He was clearly making for the shade beneath the trees. He glanced around at the surroundings and saw only the area where Xie Yu was standing was devoid of sun, so Xie Yu soon found someone else next to him.Mask was fairly tall, about half a head taller than Xie Yu.He and Xie Yu stood shoulder to shoulder watching the fight, then he leisurely pulled a lollipop from his pocket. Pink strawberry, Zhen Zhi brand. He unwrapped it in three movements. It was very hot and the sugar had melted some, and Xie Yu smelt a cloying sweetness spreading through the air.He pulled aside the mask, the black material hanging loosely at his chin, and ate the lollipop for a while. He didn\u2019t seem to have any patience for the sweet; after sucking for a while, he crunched it to pieces with his teeth. Only when he looked for somewhere to throw away the rubbish did he realize the person standing next to him might also be a challenger from the opposite side who had come to demand the violet weapon.Xie Yu endured it for a while then couldn\u2019t hold back any more: \u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201dAfter surreptitiously watching someone and then being directly called out by said person, the guy didn\u2019t seem uncomfortable at all. Without any change in expression he put the mask back on, his fingers a stark contrast against the black fabric they were curled in. His complexion seemed unnaturally pale. \u201cYou\u2019re with that lot, too?\u201dXie Yu said, \u201cSo what if I am.\u201dMask thought for a while and said, \u201cFriend, let\u2019s go a couple rounds?\u201dOn the other side, the fight was going terribly. Frankly, Xie Yu found it embarrassing and didn\u2019t really want to join in. \u201cFriend, I advise you to value your life.\u201dMask folded up his sleeves twice, revealing slender wrists: \u201cWhat a coincidence, I like courting death.\u201dTwo rounds later, Xie Yu had to admit that this person was unexpectedly good.His fighting moves were very clean: done in a single breath, quick, vicious, and accurate. Accidentally taking one of his hits would hurt from flesh right down to the bone.Xie Yu had tussled with a lot of people since he was young. When he was small he had taken a lot of hits; after turning ten, it had basically just been him hitting other people. He very rarely experienced the other side getting the advantage of him.When Xie Yu was about to use a dirty move to trip Mask onto the ground, with just a moment\u2019s effort from Mask, the battlefield became the ground. Mask held their position for a long time, then pinned Xie Yu\u2019s arm. He tried to get up from under Xie Yu but suffered another blow from Xie Yu\u2019s knee to his stomach.\u201cWait a moment\u2014\u201d Mask said, \u201cDo you know what the ground temperature is today?\u201dThere had been a heatwave for the past few days. The temperature was in the red warning zone, and every day there were people doing sunny-side-up egg experiments on the ground.Xie Yu was about to say, Surely a grown man such as yourself isn\u2019t that sensitive?Just as Xie Yu was distracted, Mask pushed him and flipped them over. The positions of the two were instantly reversed, and Mask lifted an eyebrow; his eyes were deep-set and close together, his gaze deep and unfathomable.He was very close, one hand supporting his weight next to Xie Yu\u2019s neck. He said, \u201cIt\u2019s quite warm. Feel it.\u201d\u201cFeel your grandpa.\u201d\u00b9On the floor, the two didn\u2019t even manage to go a few rounds.Xie Yu felt the weight on his body suddenly disappear. Mask had swiftly got up off of him, dusted off his trousers, and stretched out a hand to Xie Yu to pull him up, suddenly spouting nonsense: \u201c\u2026 Friend, how could you be so careless? Tripping on flat ground? Be careful when you walk. If you\u2019re like that, how can I let you go walking around the park alone?\u201dXie Yu really couldn\u2019t understand this development. \u201cAre you an idiot?\u201dMask said, \u201cYou\u2019re the idiot.\u201dThen Mask yelled to the other side, \u201cStop\u2014don\u2019t fight any more, the cops are here.\u201dOnly now did Xie Yu faintly hear the sound of a police car. Immediately after, he saw five or six police officers in full attire getting out of the cars one by one on the other side of the road, yelling across the street: \u201cOn your knees! Hands on your head! Don\u2019t move! Brawling in public! You\u2019ve got guts, have you!\u201dThey were some distance from the public brawl and Mask\u2019s reaction was very quick. He had already pulled Xie Yu to a standing position before the officers got out of their cars, and the police did not suspect that beneath the trees were two fish that had escaped the net, fighting one-on-one while enjoying the shade.Mask slung an arm across Xie Yu\u2019s shoulders. From afar, the two looked like good friends taking a stroll through the park at 10:30 in the morning. \u201cNo need to thank me. My hearing\u2019s pretty good. How about this, let\u2019s coordinate our statements. What sort of persona do you want? I\u2019ve already thought of something for me. I\u2019m an innocent bystander who ate too much for breakfast and came to the park for a stroll.\u201dXie Yu said coldly, \u201cI can\u2019t be bothered with you.\u201dMask: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dXie Yu continued, \u201cYou came out to fight and you\u2019re afraid of the cops?\u201d\u201dNot afraid.\u201d Mask shrugged and said with indifference, \u201cIt\u2019s just annoying.\u201dThe two should have been fortunate enough to watch the police take the other ten away, but man proposes, God disposes.One of the guys whose personality wasn\u2019t that strong had broken down. He looked left and looked right and didn\u2019t see his big bro, then he turned his head and saw his big bro standing under the tree. In a panic, he yelled like a chick looking for its mother: \u201c\u2014Zhao-ge!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe Zhao was really cursing up a storm in his heart.Xie Yu: \u201cZhao-ge? You?\u201dHe Zhao said, \u201cIf I said I wasn\u2019t, would you believe me?\u201dXie Yu shrugged off the arm He Zhao had put on his shoulder. The act of brotherhood reached its end and he immediately did an about-face: \u201cYou should ask the cops if they believe you.\u201dOf course, the cops wouldn\u2019t believe it.They\u2019d rather make an incorrect arrest than let someone go free. In any case, they\u2019d take them back to the station first and then see.The officer stood in front of them, looking first at one and then the other. For a moment, he wasn\u2019t sure which one of them was \u201cZhao-ge.\u201d \u201cZhao-ge? Who?\u201dHe Zhao took the first step to acknowledge the name by which he was known in those circles. \u201cMe. It\u2019s me. Surname He, name Zhao. Written zhuo-yue, Zhao.\u201dBefore Xie Yu had even had a chance to save himself and distance himself from them, he heard the person who had just pulled him up from the ground and who had wanted to coordinate statements with him, introduce him to the officer: \u201cUncle officer, he\u2019s the person I was fighting with.\u201dXie Yu: \u201c\u2026 Really, I have to say thank you.\u201d\u201dTake them along! Take them all back!\u201dAt the police station.There were too many of them: seventeen or eighteen people lined up to enter, like a long line walking the red carpet. After reaching the designated spot, they split into two lines facing each other. They squat, hands over their heads, looking very much like criminals in a TV drama.Zhou Dalei even thought this was quite novel. He nudged Xie Yu with his arm: \u201cOld Xie, do you think we\u2019re like drug dealers? I\u2019ve only seen this kind of treatment on TV. Speaking of which, the cops of Black Water Street are quite nice, comparatively. They even gave us a bench to sit on.\u201dXie Yu: \u201cYou still want to sit on a bench? Keep thinking about it.\u201dHe Zhao, squatting opposite Xie Yu, couldn\u2019t hold back a laugh.The officer sitting right in the center of the meeting table now rapped the table. \u201cWhat are you doing? Do you think you\u2019re having a tea party? And you, what are you laughing at? And you\u2019re still wearing that thing. You even know that you\u2019re embarrassing yourself? Take it off.\u201dHe Zhao obligingly removed the mask. \u201cIt\u2019s not that. I\u2019m sensitive to ultraviolet light.\u201d\u201cThen you\u2019re quite determined. Even came out to fight.\u201dHe Zhao said, \u201cCouldn\u2019t help it, it\u2019s for my subordinates. I\u2019m actually a pacifist. I don\u2019t like all this fighting.\u201dZhou Dalei nudged Xie Yu with his arm again. He tried to hold it in but really couldn\u2019t. \u201cDamn, he\u2019s a handsome devil.\u201dXie Yu: \u201cZhou Dalei, do you think that it\u2019s appropriate to get a crush on a guy while you\u2019re squatting in a police station?\u201dHe Zhao heard it, and in a good mood returned the compliment: \u201cBrother, you\u2019re quite good-looking, too.\u201dZhou Dalei let out a snort of laughter. He felt that this guy was interesting: \u201cHey, are you mixed? You look a little western.\u201dAlthough the person in front of him was squatting, his strong presence didn\u2019t diminish in the least. His hair was clean-cut, revealing half his forehead; the bridge of his nose was high, and his eyes were narrow and long. His double eyelids were cut deep; when he looked at others, his eyes seemed to speak. Deep and incomprehensible, both dangerous and careless.\u201dI\u2019m mixed blood from eight countries. Ancestors lived three generations in Europe, then went towards Southeast Asia. My dad is Arabian, my mom is French.\u201d Seeing Zhou Dalei\u2019s expression become more and more worshipful, He Zhao stopped, then said incredulously \u201c\u2026\u2026you believed that? I\u2019m Chinese. Pure, not mixed blood.\u201dSeeing these two about to overcome their enmity and form a friendship, the officer finally got to the point and strangled the friendship in its cradle: \u201cWhich of you is going to explain what all this is about? Why were you fighting?\u201dZhou Dalei immediately jumped up: \u201cBecause they stole something from me! My violet weapon! The item of my courage and my faith!\u201dThe officer motioned for him to stop. \u201cChild five?\u00b2 And they stole something?\u201dXie Yu\u2019s head hurt from listening. He felt that the forthcoming content would really be a little embarrassing.As expected, Zhou Dalei said earnestly, \u201cIt\u2019s a precious sword used by Pangu when he opened the heavens and split the earth. It has 999+ defense and offense. With it, I can rule the world and sell it for money at that. Selling it for money is the important part.\u201d\u201cWe didn\u2019t steal it.\u201d The other group wasn\u2019t happy. They all said, \u201cHow can this be called stealing? The Pangu God Sword fell on the ground. It didn\u2019t have a name on it or anything.\u201dThe officer wondered if he had caught a bunch of crazies.In order to uncover the most genuine motive for the fighting, and to more deeply understand the series of events in this situation, the few officers downloaded the online game, \u2018Genesis.\u2019How all this had happened was really laughable.They said it was a public brawl but nobody was hurt, and by the time the police arrived they had already stopped, so no explosive scene had been seen.\u201cWho has the Pangu God Sword?\u201dSomeone raised a hand: \u201cHere. It\u2019s with me.\u201dThe officer had decided on a perfect punishment to fit the crime. \u201cLog into your account.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve logged in. It\u2019s in that, my pack, it\u2019s that violet one, that\u2019s right\u2026\u201dThen the officer took the mouse and, in the right-click menu, selected [Toss.]\u201cI\u2019m showing you that in a harmonious society, the Pangu God Sword doesn\u2019t count for anything.\u201d The officer righteously turned around to face the group of \u2018juvenile delinquents\u2019 who were on the verge of crying and said passionately, \u201cNo matter how valuable it is, can it be more valuable than our country\u2019s peace?\u201dZhou Dalei: \u201c\u2026\u2026!?\u201dXie Yu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe Zhao: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

So this was \u2018heartbreak.\u2019The group of internet-addicted teens mired in their video game craze nearly rushed up to snatch Uncle Officer\u2019s mouse, but their remaining common sense held them back. Can\u2019t do that, it\u2019s not appropriate. You can\u2019t fight him. Don\u2019t seek death. You absolutely definitely have to restrain yourself.The officer pointed to the screen again, where a wild boar was currently pacing back and forth beside the glowing Pangu God Sword. \u201cIt\u2019s just a virtual object. I\u2019m not opposed to youth like yourselves playing games, but you have to do so in moderation and have the right values. Let\u2019s continue on the topic of a harmonious society. A harmonious society\u2026\u201dAfter a half-hour civics lecture, their minds were full of the two big words, \u201charmonious society,\u201d which turned circles and flowed back and forth in their minds.Xie Yu was tired of squatting. While no one was looking, he plopped down on the ground.Zhou Dalei happened to glimpse this tiny movement: \u201cOld Xie, you\u2019re slacking.\u201dXie Yu patted the ground beside him and said, \u201cYou sit, too.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Zhou Dalei hesitated for two seconds and shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t dare. I\u2019m worried he\u2019ll make me log into my account and toss all the other equipment I painstakingly gathered. My fragile soul can\u2019t take that kind of hit.\u201dXie Yu: \u201cProgress.\u201dWhen the officer was more or less finished with his educational attempt, he wished to test the results. He coughed twice to clear his throat and yelled, in the manner of an army officer, \u201cI ask, you answer. What is a harmonious society?\u201dNo one answered.They had just listened to a whole spiel about a harmonious society, but no one had told them to jot down the main points and prepare for a pop quiz. How could they remember? It was already quite good for them to have managed to listen to it all while squatting.\u201cIt\u2019s, it\u2019s\u2026. it\u2019s\u2026?\u201dThe word, \u201cit\u2019s,\u201d was said many times, tone rising and falling and brimming with emotion, but after a long time no one continued.The officer\u2019s gaze swept the group several times and landed on someone for an answer. \u201cThe pacifist from just now. Do you know?\u201dHe Zhao had started to get sleepy while listening. His eyes were half-lidded, and only when his name was called did he look up: \u201cMe?\u201dThe officer said, \u201cYes, you. Answer.\u201dHe Zhao didn\u2019t even know what the question was. He glanced left and right and no one looked like they were about to remind him. He scrambled for a while and then answered, \u201cI pick C.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dBecause of He Zhao\u2019s answer, everyone\u2019s reflection essay length increased from 2000 words to 3000.The environment in which they had to write their essays was really awful. Desks weren\u2019t even provided; they had to write against the floor. Xie Yu put the paper over his knee and his pen poked a hole in the paper when he used a little extra force.Every few lines he wrote, he would poke a new hole in the paper. When Xie Yu got to the second page, he finally frowned in frustration. \u201cFuck.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t get frustrated, friend. Relax.\u201d He Zhao was opposite Xie Yu, and his posture while writing the reflection was very relaxed. His writing was so frantic the words almost leaped off the page but he spoke lightly and calmly: \u201cLife is like that. There will be many obstacles you\u2019ll never even expect, but we can overcome\u2026 fuck! Fuck that shit, this paper is so thin? I didn\u2019t even pull at it and it ripped.\u201dXie Yu looked up and saw that the A4 paper He Zhao had been holding down with his hands had torn nearly in half. The content covering it made one wonder if they really understood Chinese. By the look of it, he had tried to write an entire line in cursive.He Zhao pulled out a new sheet of paper and set it on the ground. A guy next to him was convinced by this \u2018good handwriting\u2019 of his, and leaned over to stare at it for a long time, then tutted in amazement: \u201cI say, how do you write so fast? What is all this?\u201dHe Zhao said, \u201cIsn\u2019t it suave?\u201dXie Yu: \u201cThat self-confidence of yours is hard to come by.\u201dZhou Dalei was bored of writing and came over to chat, too. \u201cHey, handsome devil, I hear you\u2019re their leader?\u201dHe Zhao stopped and looked up. His collar was wide open and a piece of jade hanging on a red thread around his neck fell out with his movement. It was a simple shape, a round peace symbol. \u201cLeader? Surely not. We met at an internet cafe and we sometimes raid together.\u201dNow that the violet weapon had been tossed, everyone had more or less bonded by fighting. And besides, they were sitting here suffering together; surely this was fate. But Zhou Dalei still couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cYou helped steal the violet weapon?\u201d\u201dI don\u2019t have that much time to waste my energy on pointless things and kept vigil by the secret boss\u2019s spawning point for three days without sleeping or resting,\u201d He Zhao said. \u201cBut I really can\u2019t face those guys. It was indeed my idea. It was just a joke but I didn\u2019t think they\u2019d really be so dedicated.\u201dHearing that group of people say they wanted the Pangu God Sword but couldn\u2019t beat the hidden boss, he had casually said, \u201cThen steal it.\u201dHe hadn\u2019t expected that it had really given them new ideas.Zhou Dalei didn\u2019t quite understand. \u201cBut, before we fought, you still came out to taunt us?\u201dHe Zhao said, \u201cSince you wanted a fight, then we should have a proper fight, right? The atmosphere wasn\u2019t right, so I came to fix it. Friend, I really didn\u2019t have any other intentions.\u201dZhou Dalei: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d His words just seemed strange.Xie Yu: \u201cThen, really, thank you.\u201dHe Zhao: \u201cNo problem.\u201dBy the time they handed their reflections in it was already evening. Because one of them had written especially slowly and all the essays had to be handed in before they could leave, the ones who had finished first just waited at the side.\u201cJust three thousand words and you\u2019re defeated. Are you a man or not?\u201d He Zhao had tried to give him pointers at first, but even he eventually admitted that this person was unteachable. \u201cYou don\u2019t even know how to write a reflection? \u2018I was wrong. I deeply feel my mistake and I promise I will not do it again.\u2019 Then, look forward to your future\u2014write, I\u2019ll dictate and you write.\u201dXie Yu watched coldly from the side. In the time it took others to write 3000 words, this person had only written an introduction. Xie Yu wasn\u2019t as chatty as He Zhao: he only said one thing and had already almost made the person cry. \u201cTell me, did you really finish nine years of compulsory education?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAll in?\u201d The officer from before had received a phone call and had gone out to take care of some matters. Now he picked up the thick stack of reflection essays, flipped through them, and said, \u201cAll right, that\u2019s it. Seeing as you are first-time offenders, we\u2019ve decided to give you a chance to turn over a new leaf. Don\u2019t let something like this happen again. Whether you\u2019re minors or not, you have to take responsibility for your actions.\u201dEveryone answered in unison: \u201cYes, yes, yes, thank you uncle officer.\u201d\u201cIt won\u2019t happen again.\u201d\u201dYou must deeply remember the four core principles and eight major values of a harmonious society.\u201cHow about this. Stand in two lines, the way you did when you first arrived.\u201dZhou Dalei hesitated. Was this so that everyone would leave tidily? This place really did value order.Xie Yu and He Zhao resumed their original position in line and stood face to face. He Zhao had, at some point, put his mask back on and only his eyes showed.After everyone was in position, the officer let them know an important piece of information, so explosive that no piece of skin on them remained intact: \u201cThis police station practices education that springs from love. Based on the principles of love, we\u2019ll try out some measures targeted to kids like you who brawl publicly. Now shake hands, hug, and say, \u201cI love you, my friend,\u201d so that you will really feel the meaning of a harmonious society. Children, the world is a good place. The world is full of love.\u201dXie Yu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe Zhao: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dZhou Dalei: \u201c\u2026\u2026?!\u201d The police of this area were too perverted, surely?Evening, 7 p.m.Xie Yu sat in a Lanzhou ramen store and looked at his phone as he waited for Zhou Dalei to eat his second serving of ramen.\u201cReally. I don\u2019t dare fight in this area any more.\u201d Zhou Dalei used his chopsticks to pick out the spring onion, then picked up the noodles and shoved them in his mouth. With his mouth full he said, \u201cMpf tham scared.\u201d\u00b9Xie Yu put down his phone: \u201cFinish eating, then talk.\u201dZhou Dalei gulped the food down, ignoring that it was piping hot. \u201cI, Lei-zai, have walked the world for sixteen years, and it\u2019s my first time meeting such a thing\u2014I love you, my friend? Please, give this worldly youth a way out.\u201dThe more the worldly youth eating noodles spoke, the more he felt it was unjustified beyond words. In the end, he condensed all his feelings into a single line: \u201cI don\u2019t bow to anybody but I\u2019ll bow to that guy in the station who\u2019s so shameless. How can he be so cavalier?\u201dUpon hearing how that person was shameless, Xie Yu went slightly green.Out of everyone, He Zhao was the one who was least psychologically burdened and the one who acted quickest.He had caught Xie Yu\u2019s hand very naturally, sincerely taken his shoulders, and hugged him. He had said, \u201cI love you, my friend,\u201d full of emotion, and they had seemed like a pair of long-lost blood brothers.Night had fallen. An evening wind suddenly rose and cooled the heat of the day some.\u201cActually, that violet weapon from today\u2026 it really wasn\u2019t the video game equipment that I cared about.\u201d Zhou Dalei\u2019s voice suddenly went quiet and he put down his chopsticks. \u201cYou know, my grades aren\u2019t good. When I read textbooks I get confused and I have no idea what\u2019s going on. My parents\u2019 barbecue stand doesn\u2019t really count for work, and it\u2019s pretty exhausting, but what else can I do? I only know how to play video games. I can get by playing video games, right? Selling game equipment\u2026 Boss Xie, what do you think? Do I have any chance of becoming a professional esports player?\u201dXie Yu didn\u2019t say anything and listened quietly.\u201dForget it, I was just saying. No matter how good you are at a game, it\u2019s not a job, is it.\u201d Zhou Dalei grabbed a napkin, wiped his mouth, and got up. \u201cLet\u2019s go. It\u2019s late and we have to hurry home. Did you tell your mom you were going out? She\u2019s probably worried.\u201dZhou Dalei was usually a heartless person. To someone who didn\u2019t know him, he was a quintessential rascal who wasn\u2019t good at anything.In the second year of middle school, he had successfully chased a girl he liked. That girl had also been in the second year and thought that having a hooligan friend was badass. By the time their second year was over, she was looking down on him for not being able to do this or that, which shot his heart full of holes. She said she really had been blind.But the Zhou Dalei Xie Yu knew wasn\u2019t like that.\u201cLei-zi.\u201d\u201cMm?\u201d\u201cDo you like playing games?\u201d\u201cYeah, I like to.\u201d\u201cWhat would you say your skill level is?\u201dZhou Dalei treated it as shooting the breeze and said, \u201cVery good, all right?\u201dZhou Dalei walked very far before he realized Xie Yu wasn\u2019t following him.He turned back and was about to yell, \u201cWhat are you doing, are you coming? We gotta catch the bus,\u201d when he heard his good friend say from ten meters away, \u201cI think you\u2019re good.\u201dZhou Dalei froze.Xie Yu laughed as he said, \u201cYou\u2019re damn good.\u201d\u00b2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A-Fang had been following behind him since the entrance, and he abruptly came to a stop: \u201cIf you have something to say, say it.\u201dA-Fang glanced towards the living room without changing her expression, then said quietly, \u201cMadam\u2019s been in a bad mood all afternoon and didn\u2019t eat much at dinner. This time she really is angry. Second young master, when you go in, please don\u2019t talk back to her too much.\u201dGu Xuelan was in the living room watching television. Although she seemed to be her usual self on the surface, Xie Yu could tell from the back of her head that this night would be a difficult one to pass.The TV was showing a clich\u00e9d dramatic soap opera: bad acting, terrible plot. The male lead twisted his features to show his pain. \u201cI love you, but I love her too\u2026 I really don\u2019t know what to do. You and she are the two most important women in my life.\u201dXie Yu walked over: \u201cMom.\u201dGu Xuelan said nothing.The only response was the sound of the male lead saying more and more ridiculous things.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Xie Yu endured the theatrics of the brain-damaging TV drama and bowed his head, admitting his mistake. \u201cThis morning, I shouldn\u2019t have left without saying anything.\u201d\u201cShouldn\u2019t have left without saying anything.\u201d Gu Xuelan turned off the TV, then slapped the remote onto the glass coffee table with a bang. \u201cWhat, were you going to proudly walk out the front door? Xie Yu, I told you before. During this vacation, I want you to stay home. Don\u2019t go to those sketchy places. Your most important task right now is to study.\u201d\u201dMom, I think I have the right to decide how I spend my vacation.\u201dGu Xuelan\u2019s voice became noticeably sharper. \u201c\u2014What right do you have? When you\u2019re of age, then talk to me about rights. I didn\u2019t raise you to let you dally about all day, eating and passing time and waiting for death. All you do all day is run around outside. Have you thought about your future? You\u2019re still young. The things you can\u2019t think about, Mom will think about for you. You don\u2019t have enough self-control and if you can\u2019t do something, then Mom will make the effort to watch over you and do it. In the end, it\u2019s still my fault, is it?\u201dXie Yu was silent.Gu Xuelan took a breath and sat down. With shaking hands she picked up a cup from the coffee table. She said, \u201cYou might blame your mother now, but in future, you\u2019ll understand. Mom is doing all this for your sake.\u201d\u201dI know,\u201d Xie Yu said. \u201cI have my own plans. After the university exams, just watch and see if I get into Tsinghua or Peking University.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re saying that just to keep me quiet. What plans do you have? If you really have plans, your grades wouldn\u2019t be like this. Tsinghua, Peking U\u2026 you\u2019re dreaming.\u201d Gu Xuelan\u2019s chest was so heavy it hurt.Since awkwardly seeing Mr. Huang off this morning, she had experienced many emotions. Now that Xie Yu was in front of her, with no consternation and not feeling at all that he had done anything wrong, all her feelings welled up at once. \u201cWho did you learn from to become like this? Zhou Dalei? Xu Yanmei? You want to be like those people from Black Water Street, do you?!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dXie Yu had intended to bow and admit his mistake, and good-temperedly cajole Madam Gu so that she would stop being angry. After all, today\u2019s incident was indeed his fault. If she really wanted him to cooperate with the tutor and study at home all vacation, then he would study.But the last sentence made him suddenly look up. He spoke slowly, but his eyes were cold and piercing \u201cThose people\u2026 what do you mean by those people?\u201dAfter saying the words, even Gu Xuelan felt she had spoken out of turn.But she was currently angry and had no way of backing down.The two faced off in silence.\u201dDinner is in the kitchen. If you\u2019re hungry, go and eat.\u201d Gu Xuelan\u2019s attitude softened some and helplessness enveloped her completely.Xie Yu had a stubborn personality and often even Gu Xuelan wasn\u2019t sure what kind of approach she should take to teach him.She had brought her child up alone. She couldn\u2019t help the lack of a father figure in Xie Yu\u2019s life growing up, and she had no way of filling the role for him.No one had taught her how to guide a child with a strong rebellious streak in his youth. He was no longer the soft baby who had lain in her arms and depended on her; he would no longer pester her to go out and play with him. When he walked, he was no longer unsteady on his feet. He wouldn\u2019t walk halfway and then realize his mom hadn\u2019t followed him, stop, and turn back to look for her.Now, he was going his own way and seemed to have left her behind. They had less and less to say to each other. She didn\u2019t know what he was thinking, and the light in the youth\u2019s eyes had grown brighter and brighter; behind his eyes gradually formed a world she didn\u2019t understand.After Gu Xuelan went upstairs, Xie Yu went to the kitchen and poured himself some water. He saw a plate of fried egg with tomato placed neatly to the side and covered with a bowl. The egg had been fried to a golden brown, a light dusting of spring onion flakes sprinkled on top.Madam Gu had made it herself.He didn\u2019t need to taste it, he could tell at a glance.Xie Yu suddenly felt that what he had done today was really very dastardly.The night deepened and the big house grew silent again.Xie Yu showered, then remembered his phone was still set to airplane mode. He turned it off and a dozen messages flooded in at once: a seemingly endless string of chimes.The messages from Aunt Mei were the most numerous. Asking where he was and saying not to let his temper get the best of him, and to go home quick, your mom is very worried.Lei\u2019s mom had sent two, too. The last was from Lei-zi, asking if he had gotten home.Xie Yu: Got home.Lei-zi: That\u2019s good that you got home. The moment I got home, my mom grabbed me and asked if I knew where you went. Damn, it was like you had gone missing. She was so worried. It scared me.Although Madam Gu\u2019s words had been fierce, with the attitude of, \u2018no matter how you argue I won\u2019t listen,\u2019 she hadn\u2019t pressed the matter of the home tutoring. She had just left it at that.Zhong Jie, who had not the slightest bit to do with this matter, seemed like a cock who had won a fight. His mood was great, and from time to time he would bring this up in conversation.Xie Yu had \u2018learned to be good\u2019 and remained cold and polite. \u201cMm, yes, you did well. You\u2019re great. You\u2019re right. Happy now? Are you satisfied?\u201dZhong Jie: \u201c\u2026..\u201d The more he listened the more mad he got.Without having to deal with home tuition, Xie Yu\u2019s vacation time became much more leisurely.The tournament period of Question King Tournament was during the holidays and stopped when school started up. Winter and summer vacations were the scheduled times for the tournaments. This summer vacation was this unpopular game\u2019s first try at a tournament, and the one crowned Question King at the end would be the esteemed first-ever Question King.\u201cIlovestudying\u201d: Top Student X didn\u2019t log on today? Is he sick?\u201cForABetterTomorrow\u201d: Why does it have to be illness? \u2026Can\u2019t you think on the bright side? People have lives.\u201cIlovestudying\u201d: In my eyes, as long as Top Student X still draws breath, he won\u2019t give up on studying. He puts in so much effort. He\u2019s talent and effort in one. Without pride and without frustration. Even at 5 a.m. he doesn\u2019t sleep. He\u2019s my studying role model.\u201cTop Student X, whose journey of studying even death could not stand in the way of\u201d was currently playing cards with two old aunties.Xie Yu: \u201cOne circle.\u201dXu Yanmei: \u201cThree plus one.\u201dLei\u2019s mom: \u201cDon\u2019t want it.\u201dXie Yu played again: \u201cBomb.\u201dThe underground\u2019s elder sister of Black Water Street, Comrade Xu Yanmei, had recently become addicted to mobile game Dou Dizhu. All day she asked people in the chat group to play cards\u00b9 with her.Lei\u2019s mom glanced at her hand of bad cards: \u201cI\u2019m not playing any more. I can\u2019t win anyway. I have to make dinner.\u201dXu Yanmei: \u201cYou always do that. If you can\u2019t win, you leave?\u201dLei\u2019s mom was very frank: \u201cI really have to make dinner, or do you want my son Lei to eat dirt?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dXie Yu said: \u201cI\u2019m giving up, too. Against me, you\u2019ll lose anyway no matter how you play. It\u2019s terrible.\u201dXie Yu was famously lucky and Zhou Dalei always called him \u201cBoss Xie.\u201dBefore, during the New Year, when everyone got together to play cards, Xie Yu would be held at bay by everyone else. No one wanted to match skills at a table with him. So Xie Yu\u2019s life was like that of a pitiful old person who didn\u2019t have children to take care of him in his twilight years: he sat alone at the side, watched television, and drank hot water.At first, Zhou Dalei still tried to include his brother and pulled him to a table. \u201cHe\u2019s not as great as you all think, really. His card skills are just ordinary, it\u2019s just dogshit luck. If you don\u2019t believe me, let\u2019s see. This time he\u2019ll definitely be so bad he can\u2019t do anything.\u201dIn the end, Xie Yu completely neglected Dalei\u2019s trust in him. Not only did he win all the money he could, he even won four IOUs.Xie Yu logged onto Question King Tournament again because he suddenly remembered that during there was a limited-time double-experience activity this weekend.[Question King Development Team]: Tonight, Question Kings, rejoice! Is everyone ready! Not only are new question types being released, complete with content in every subject and with increased difficulty, we have even released a whole new spectator mode! You can watch from up close the top students doing questions and one-on-one PK! Competition is open and transparent, and only ability speaks. Cheating and hacking have nowhere to hide!When spectator mode was released, everyone discussed it in a frenzy.\u201cIlovestudying\u201d: Great. Like this, I can see just how far away I am from other people, and how other people think about solving the questions. Maybe that will help open up new pathways of thinking. I can approach the same question from different perspectives and I will achieve double the outcome with half the effort!\u201cServeTheHomeland\u201d: Bless the development team. Spectator mode is really a great surprise. I\u2019ve always wanted to watch the gods on the leaderboard do questions.\u201cStudystudystudythatsallIdo\u201d: My summer vacation was only this fruitful because of you all. Every time I open this app, I know there\u2019s an endless stream of questions waiting for me, and I feel especially blessed. I did many questions I could otherwise never have encountered, constantly challenged myself, and kept up my love for studying.Xie Yu remained with both his ears closed to his surroundings. He started the app and immediately started answering questions. He didn\u2019t notice that in the upper left corner a grey line of words had appeared, and the grey line kept changing.Spectators: 82.\u201cIlovestudying\u201d: Top Student X\u2019s question speed is a bit scary\u2026.\u201cForABetterTomorrow\u201d: He\u2019s X-God, all right? A god answering questions. No wonder he\u2019s attacking the leaderboard so forcefully. I haven\u2019t even finished reading the question and he\u2019s already solved it halfway. 666.\u201cStudystudystudythatsallIdo\u201d: That diagram just now, did anyone understand it? He went up and drew five helping lines? Is that how?\u201cFightingUpstream\u201d: Helping lines are annoying, but for this lot, they\u2019re useful. He solved the first two sub-questions at once.\u201cForABetterTomorrow\u201d: Classmates, 666 is doing questions.Xie Yu didn\u2019t know that there were nearly a hundred crazy people watching him do questions.He just knew that at 3:30 a.m., he finally pushed Shameless out of the first position on the leaderboard.No.1: jsdhwdmaX.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He had long since mentally patched in a story of world-ending tragedy, a loath-to-part, I-love-you-you-love-him, in-the-end-you-don\u2019t-belong-to-me, if I can\u2019t-have-you-I\u2019ll-destroy-you story of puppy love.The plot twisted and turned and rose and fell, mysterious and exciting.Zhou Dalei carefully sent a text to show concern. \u201c\u2026 Let bygones be bygones.\u201dXie Yu didn\u2019t quite understand where this inexplicable \u2018bro, I understand everything\u2019 attitude had come from. \u201cWhat do you know?\u201dZhou Dalei replied: \u201cI get it\u2026 I really get it. Don\u2019t be upset.\u201d\u2026\u2026Later, Xie Yu would ask himself more than once: if he had known then that this game would ruin so many things, and make him meet a crazy competitor who would relentlessly pursue him, would he have opened this game?\u2014He probably wouldn\u2019t have.He wouldn\u2019t have.He\u2019d die before he played it.The night Xie Yu pushed \u201cQuestion King\u201d off his pedestal, everyone celebrated.Just like poor citizens who fought against forces of evil and had finally been released, they almost stood and loudly sang praise. Even their thought processes when they answered questions now flowed much easier.\u201cStudystudystudythatsallIdo\u201d: 25th of July. I will always remember this day. The sky over the land of freedom is blue.\u201cILikeMemorizingVocab\u201d: One Question King has fallen, and thousands upon tens of thousands of citizens now glimpse hope.\u201dTopTenInClass\u201d: I\u2019m going to sleep. Sweetly. Tomorrow when I get up I\u2019ll do ten more mock exam papers to express my joy.But this group wasn\u2019t happy for very long. Before \u201cTop ten in class\u201d had even finished his ten mock exam papers, on the second night, the missing person Shameless suddenly logged on. This guy kept doing questions until the morning, without sleep or rest or letting up, and snatched back first place.The sky over the land of freedom was no longer blue.When Xie Yu next went online, he saw the mournful cries that filled the chat, along with summons for X God to accept the challenge. This was really too cruel.\u201cEnglishClassRep\u201d: You spectated the fight yesterday?\u201cForABetterTomorrow\u201d: \u2026Yes. Shameless did a question halfway and found out we were spectating, then wrote in the answer zone, \u201cNo need to look, you don\u2019t understand anyway.\u201d\u201cForABetterTomorrow\u201d: He even made a side account just to observe the chat and humiliate us.Xie Yu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dEveryone was cheering for God X, but by now Xie Yu had gone several rounds with the Question King. One day one of them was in first place, the next the other. In order to keep their spot on the leaderboard, both of them hadn\u2019t slept for several nights and were tired beyond belief. They might really die if they kept playing.Xie Yu was pondering just giving up, going offline, and going to sleep. Fighting on was meaningless, but he couldn\u2019t control his hands. After answering one question, he tapped to the next on autopilot. As he kept tapping, a system notification came up.[Question King wishes to add you as a friend. Do you accept?]Xie Yu refused it three or four times, but at the rate things were going, if he didn\u2019t accept he probably wouldn\u2019t be able to go on doing this question.Question King: Are you tired?jsdhwdmaX\uff1a\uff1fQuestion King: Let\u2019s talk. Truce. I have to sleep.The two reached an agreement. Xie Yu was planning to log out, but by the time he had showered and climbed into bed, he unintentionally discovered that beside the online status of his good friend \u2018Question King\u2019 was written a small line [Doing questions].\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dXie Yu felt that he might have been sabotaged.In the blink of an eye, summer vacation was more than half over. As the start of school drew near again, Madam Gu Xuelan was even more worried than Xie Yu himself, as if she was the one going to school. \u201cHave you finished your homework?\u201d\u201cMm.\u201d\u201cFor second year, the students will be split into certain classes, right?\u201d\u201cMm.\u201dGu Xuelan put a piece of fried egg into Xie Yu\u2019s bowl and used the gentleness tactic: \u201cWho knows what class you\u2019ll be placed into? This semester, rein yourself in a little. If something happens, don\u2019t be impulsive. I won\u2019t quibble with you about everything that happened before. From this semester on, do well.\u201d\u201c\u2026Mm.\u201dWhatever she said, Xie Yu answered, \u201cMm.\u201d Gu Xuelan knew too well that after he had finished \u201cMm\u201d-ing, it was guaranteed that he\u2019d still do what he liked. She put down her bowl and chopsticks and didn\u2019t say anything more. She sat across from Xie Yu and quietly watched him eat.Xie Yu took a piece of fish and meticulously removed the bones, then put it in Madam Gu\u2019s bowl. He looked up and said, \u201cYou\u2019re not eating any more? You\u2019re full just by watching me?\u201dGu Xuelan looked at the piece of fish for many minutes. She wanted to say something but wasn\u2019t sure how to say it. In the end, she said carefully: \u201cIn second year are you still going to live at school?\u201dXie Yu\u2019s hand paused.He understood Madam Gu\u2019s meaning.Zhong Jie was about to enter his first year of university, and when that time came around they basically wouldn\u2019t see each other at home. Xie Yu and Zhong Jie quarrelled on sight and neither of them could stomach the other. If they lived together without someone to restrain them, they\u2019d fight every minute.Gu Xuelan kept asking, \u201cYou don\u2019t want to move back home?\u201dXie Yu swiftly finished the few bites of food left in his bowl. \u201cProbably not. It\u2019s quite nice living in school, and the conditions aren\u2019t bad. It\u2019s convenient to go to class\u2014 the classrooms are just a few steps away. And it\u2019s not like I don\u2019t come home over the weekend.\u201dGu Xuelan was going to say more but Xie Yu cut her off: \u201cMom, it\u2019s nothing to do with you. Don\u2019t think too much. I live at school, not because of Zhong Jie and not because of you. It\u2019s my own problem.\u201d\u201cYour own problem? What problem?\u201dXie Yu didn\u2019t want to say more; he wasn\u2019t sure how to say it, anyway. \u201cNothing. I\u2019m just living at school. I\u2019m already grown, so you don\u2019t have to worry.\u201dLiyang Erzhong was very supportive of students living at school. This would help students develop the skills for self-sufficiency.On the first day of school, the principal had delivered a moving speech on the subject of \u201cliving at school:\u201d School is a place where students learn, but to all you parents: throughout the different stages of your child\u2019s development, you need to learn continuously, too. The most important lesson is letting go when the time is right. They already know how to run, and they are even running ahead of you. Will you treat them like the toddlers they were, who couldn\u2019t walk and couldn\u2019t eat on their own? Of course, this requires courage, too. You love them, but you must be brutal. You must let them fall, so that they will learn to get up on their own.For some reason, this speech had left an especially deep impression on Gu Xuelan.She had to admit the principal made a good point, but sometimes\u2026 even if she understood, so what?\u201dI\u2019ll help you pack your things,\u201d Gu Xuelan said. \u201cGet your things ready, then let\u2019s see what you don\u2019t have yet.\u201dAs the luggage bag grew more and more full, the vacation also drew to an end.Also drawing to an end was the summer tournament of Question King.Xie Yu and Question King had fought until they both couldn\u2019t open an eye. Then they both decided on a final date on which to have a showdown. After making this appointment, they had\u2014in tacit agreement\u2014not gone online again.At first, Xie Yu had wondered if this was another ploy of Shameless\u2019s. But he waited several days and found that Question King really hadn\u2019t logged in to do questions. This was rather surprising.Now it had been almost a month since he had last logged in. Xie Yu opened the app with the Apple of Knowledge icon: the Apple of Knowledge spun twice on the screen before showing a line of words: \u201cDue to investors withdrawing their investment, the game is temporarily offline.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe game had really shut up shop?And shut up shop so thoroughly at that?Xie Yu could almost imagine what that group of study maniacs would say. \u201cWithdrawn their investment? Studying is so interesting, how can it be that no one is playing? Why are there so few people who love studying?\u201dXie Yu hadn\u2019t yet recovered when he got Zhou Dalei\u2019s phone call. \u201cBoss Xie, are you coming tonight? Aunt Mei said to invite you over for dinner tonight to celebrate you going back to school. She said to give you some encouragement so that in the new semester you can dig up your learning potential\u2026 Boss Xie? If you heard me, say something? What have you been doing all summer break? You seemed to have been hypnotized every day.\u201d\u201cYeah, very hypnotized,\u201d Xie Yu said. \u201cReally damn hypnotized.\u201dZhou Dalei had gotten up late. He yawned. He was only wearing a pair of pants, and held an iron bowl decorated with white and red flowers where the paint was flaking. He walked out of the house, put the washbasin under the tap, and turned the water on. As he listened to the water flowing, he said, \u201cWhat time are you coming? I\u2019ll go get you at the bus stop.\u201dXie Yu: \u201cIt\u2019s only a few steps. Come and get me, my ass.\u201dZhou Dalei: \u201cYou\u2019re my bro. I don\u2019t care, I\u2019m coming. If I stay at home I\u2019ll be nagged by this group of women\u2026 Right, is Aunt Lan coming?\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s not coming,\u201d Xie Yu said. \u201cShe said she had something on.\u201d\u201dI hadn\u2019t thought about it until now, but we really haven\u2019t seen each other in a long time.\u201d Zhou Dalei continued, \u201cAll right, I\u2019ll hang up first. Washing my face.\u201dWhen Xie Yu got off the bus, Zhou Dalei had a cigarette in his mouth and wore a pair of flip-flops. He was squatting by the road sign, smoking. The passersby who saw him all skirted around him, thinking he was some hooligan.Xie Yu kicked him: \u201cAre you done acting badass? Let\u2019s go.\u201dZhou Dalei put out his cigarette on the ground, extinguishing it in a couple presses. He dusted off his pants and stood up: \u201cNot acting badass. Someone took away the bench that used to be here. I should have been sitting there very elegantly waiting for you.\u201dXie Yu glanced over. Indeed, over by the sign there used to be a place to sit, reserved for people waiting for the bus. Now, only four lonely metal poles remained.\u201cImpressive, right,\u201d Zhou Dalei said. \u201cPeople will do anything. I\u2019m really in awe.\u201dRecently, Guang Mao\u2019s business had not been great. Xu Yanmei had free time and remembering that Xie Yu and the others were about to start school again, she suggested everyone get together for a reunion meal.Xie Yu hadn\u2019t come to this apartment building for a long time.The walls of the two buildings were mottled, separated by only a narrow alley. If one household were to yell, anyone across the street could hear. In the past, Zhou Dalei\u2019s mom used to spank him with his pants off until his buttocks were red. When she yelled, \u2018Begin,\u2019 Aunt Mei across the street would open the window, stand on the balcony and yell, \u201cLei-zai, what did you do now? Tell Aunt Mei and she\u2019ll put in a word for you.\u201dIn comparison, Madam Gu was more concerned with appearances. She lowered her voice when she got mad: her violence was the cold kind.Electric lines crossed overhead the entire way as Xie Yu walked over. The whole environment seemed dirty and messy.Xie Yu and Zhou Dalei hadn\u2019t even reached the door when Aunt Mei pushed the window open. The greasy smell of fried food drifted out, mixed with the scent of home cooking. \u201cDon\u2019t come up! Go to the store and get some salt, we\u2019re out!\u201dZhou Dalei raised his head: \u201cGot it, got it.\u201d\u201cHave the jasmine flowered?\u201dZhu Dalei was about to say, \u201cLet\u2019s go to the store,\u201d but hearing this from Xie Yu, he turned around and followed Xie Yu\u2019s gaze to the jasmine flower in the pot on his balcony. \u201cAhh\u2014yes, that plant Da Mei gave me when he left. It\u2019s just a few buds, and I thought it\u2019d just be a decorative plant. But it\u2019s quite the fighter.\u201cThat guy isn\u2019t reliable. He\u2019s been overseas for almost half a year and still hasn\u2019t been in contact. Only gave me a shitty flowerpot. When he left he even said something about this being his precious baby and told me to take care of it properly. Take care of it, my ass.\u201d Zhou Dalei continued, \u201cWhen he gets back, gotta beat him up.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even the nickname \u2018Da Mei\u2019 had been jokingly given by Zhou Dalei: \u201cSince you\u2019re my little brother, big brother will give you a name. How about Da Mei? From now on, we brothers will have neat and tidy names.\u201dBecause Da Mei was small-statured, he was always bullied by others and he often didn\u2019t retaliate.Zhou Dalei protected him like he was protecting his young. When there were too many opponents for him to beat, he called Xie Yu to go with them.Later Da Mei had a growth spurt, shooting upwards like bamboo. He reached 1.85 m. He felt that he had grown up. He had watched the others fighting for many years, and while he hadn\u2019t eaten pork he had seen pigs run.\u00b9One time he couldn\u2019t take it and stood in front of Da Lei and said, \u201cLet me teach these idiots a lesson.\u201dIn the end, theory and practice were as far away from each other as heaven and earth. Da Mei couldn\u2019t hurt them and Zhou Dalei grabbed him, turned, and ran: \u201cYou teach them a lesson, my ass. Do you even know how to fight? Your skinny arms and skinny legs are longer than other people\u2019s but what good are they otherwise? \u2014You\u2019ll drive me mad, you will.\u201d\u201cThat little brat gave me a pot of shitty flowers. What did he give you before he left?\u201d The more Zhou Dalei thought about it the angrier he became. \u201c\u2026No, this doesn\u2019t count as giving. At best, it\u2019s considered lending it to me to foster.\u201dXie Yu looked up at the electric lines, also seeming to remember things from the past. The corners of his lips lifted in a smile. \u201cA Rubik\u2019s cube.\u201dZhou Dalei: \u201cAh?\u201dXie Yu: \u201cA little better than yours. Before Da Mei left, he gave me a Rubik\u2019s cube.\u201dXu Yanmei\u2019s cooking really wasn\u2019t all that good. It looked good, but always had its own unique flavor. Besides, she often forgot to add seasoning.\u201cThis is really so good I can\u2019t describe it.\u201d Zhou Dalei swallowed the bok choy. \u201cBut I want to ask you something. Since you didn\u2019t put salt in the food, why did you make us go to a concession stand and get it for you?Xu Yanmei didn\u2019t believe it: \u201cDid I forget to put salt? Not possible. I think I did even better than usual this time around. I paid a lot of attention to every step.\u201dXie Yu said: \u201cTry for yourself?\u201dIn the end, the words \u201ceaten their fill\u201d could not be applied to this meal, and they ordered shrimp takeout to save the day.\u201cCome, cheers\u2014\u201d After several cups of wine, Aunt Mei almost stood up on the table. With one leg horizontally propped on the chair, she slapped her chest. \u201cCome, come and drink! Xiao Yu-er is starting school tomorrow. Everyone, say something.\u201dXie Yu reached out and nudged the plate full of shrimp shells in front of Xu Yanmei to one side, worried that she\u2019d knock them off the table.Zhou Dalei took the lead and stood up with his glass of water: \u201cBoss Xie, I\u2019ll go first. I give you good wishes. I wish that in Liyang Sizhong, you\u2026\u201d\u201cSizhong?\u201d Xie Yu couldn\u2019t hold it in any more and kicked him, laughing. \u201cSi, your ass. I go to Erzhong.\u201dLiyang Erzhong had stood for more than sixty years and was even a little famous in A City.Its teaching resources were ordinary and its graduation rate wasn\u2019t great, either. It was located in the suburbs, which, to put it nicely, had a quiet, peaceful learning atmosphere with good air. It was close to several non-mainstream schools that had been built later and its position was really awkward.But the school campus was really architected quite well. The school buildings had been refurbished one by one over the past two years and it didn\u2019t look \u2018derelict\u2019 in the least. After all, A City was a large and famous city. Even the suburbs were bustling and the shopping district did booming business.The school gates were high and imposing. Looking in from the outside, aside from the green plants and trees, the most eye-catching thing was the bronze statue in the middle of the courtyard. Rodin\u2019s The Thinker. On a marble pedestal, the bronze statue shone, ochre and bright.On the pedestal, the school\u2019s motto was carved in small neat words: The Heart of Innocence.The four simple gold-embossed words gleamed beneath the sunlight.The first day of school was very lively.Many new students came to check in. A large banner hung across the entrance: Welcome year 1 students to the Er Zhong family. Learn, improve, and reach glory together.All the second-years were crowded around the noticeboard at the door to see the class placements. It was so packed that all of them were sweating heavily. After looking for a while, they saw something and inhaled sharply in unison. \u201cWhat\u2019s the deal with class 2.3?\u201d\u201cClass 2.3? Damn, is this a slaughterhouse?\u201d\u201c\u2026Th-thank goodness I\u2019m in class 5.\u201d\u201cI suddenly felt a chill.\u201d\u201cThe two school tyrants in one class? What were they thinking? Do they want the school to blow up?\u201d\u201cXie Yu, He Zhao\u2026. Fuck me, fuck all of this.\u201dThis group of students were all second-years. In their first year they had been placed into more than a dozen classes. Because the school building construction had been delayed, the year was split into two and put into the West and East buildings, looking upon each other from afarThe two buildings were linked and there was a corridor between them, but this was mostly for the convenience of teachers getting to their classes. The students sometimes walked through it, but the students in the two buildings didn\u2019t interact for the most part.And there happened to be two villains in this series of events\u2014He Zhao of the East, and Xie Yu of the West.The group of students got together and chitchatted, one sentence followed by another. At last, the whole group fell into silence.Their minds only contained one word: Terrifying.The group of people who had been assigned to Class 2.3 trembled. \u201cWe probably can\u2019t go to school any more\u2026 both these people are legendary hooligans who kill people without batting an eye.\u201dHooligan Xie Yu hadn\u2019t even realized what was happening. He dragged his luggage behind him, planning to go to his dorm room and put his things down before going to the classroom to get his books.Gu Xuelan was going to walk him into the dorm building and even go up to see his dorm room, but he suddenly remembered the whole stack of 5-3\u00b2 he hadn\u2019t done spread out on the desk, and it wasn\u2019t quite appropriate.Although the dorm rooms were doubles, Xie Yu had always lived alone.Er Zhong was a high school that valued freedom. Since the students were encouraged to live at school, the school had made thorough arrangements for all things related to school living. For example, students had the right to switch rooms at any time until they were satisfied. They didn\u2019t need to worry about roommate conflicts; if they didn\u2019t get along, they could swap out immediately.So Xie Yu had never even seen his roommates. The moment they heard the words \u2018Xie Yu\u2019 they all took the long way around the issue; no one dared live with him at all.Xie Yu rolled his luggage into the room, and immediately a boy with a buzzcut and wearing round-framed spectacles ran down from upstairs. Round Glasses ran like he was on fire to the room opposite Xie Yu\u2019s and stopped.Round Glasses knocked at the opposite door for a long time. \u201c\u2014Zhao-ge, are you there, Zhao-ge?\u201dNo response whatsoever.\u201cIs it this room or not? He suddenly said he was going to live in the dorm. Surely he\u2019s not blowing me off?\u201d Round Glasses talked to himself for a while, then raised his hand to knock on the door and found that it wasn\u2019t even locked. With a creak, his knock pushed the door open. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI, I\u2019m coming in, alright\u2026.\u201dRound Glasses pushed the door open and went in. He glanced around and found someone on the bed to the right.He Zhao\u2019s eyes were narrowed, a sleepy expression on his face. He sat on the bed with his back to the wall and pulled a box of sweets from the head of the bed. \u201cWhat\u2019re you making all that noise for?\u201dRound Glasses said mysteriously, \u201cZhao-ge, extremely big news. Did you see the class placement chart? Damn, the whole year\u2019s in an uproar.\u201d\u201cHaven\u2019t seen it.\u201d He Zhao picked an orange lollipop from the box, unwrapped it in a couple movements, and tossed it in his mouth. \u201cIt\u2019s just class placements. What\u2019s there to see?\u201dRound Glasses stared, stunned, and for a moment seemed to forget he was bringing big news. \u201cAm I going blind? What are these, Zhen Zhi lollipops? You\u2019re eating lollipops?\u201dHe Zhao said: \u201cRecently quit smoking.\u201dSeeing Round Glasses still staring at him in a daze, like an idiot, He Zhao continued, \u201cWhat, do you want one too?\u201d\u201cNo, no, no, no need.\u201d Round Glasses kept waving his hand.He Zhao crunched the lollipop and kept the stick in his mouth. It was sweet, a little cloying. \u201cWhat\u2019s your extremely big news?\u201dOnly now did Round Glasses remember his mission. He slapped his leg: \u201cFuck, almost forgot. Zhao-ge, this year is going to be terrible. Like fucking God himself was behind the scenes\u2026 Xie Yu\u2019s in your class.\u201d\u201cWho?\u201d\u201cXie Yu from the east building.\u201dSecond-year group, faculty office.\u201cWho did the class placements for this year? The computer or the form teachers? Surely class placements can\u2019t be done so haphazardly.\u201d Even though the teachers had known the class placements beforehand, they still couldn\u2019t accept it.A woman stood in front of the water cooler, getting water: \u201cThere are only three culture classes this year, and we split classes according to arts and science streams. Class 3 is the only science class. It\u2019s not odd that the placements were done like this.\u201dLiyang Erzhong was a fine arts oriented school. Their culture stream\u00b3 couldn\u2019t outdo students from other schools, but in fine arts, they still had quite a good graduation rate. The school encouraged students to pursue the fine arts from their very first year. In the second year, they might as well split the culture students from the arts students.The woman had finished getting her water and continued, \u201cNo matter how bad those two kids are, they\u2019re just children. If we haven\u2019t tried, how do we know we can\u2019t handle them? Maybe the situation isn\u2019t as bad as we think it is.\u201d\u201cYou can do it?\u201d Another woman who had been sitting without saying a word couldn\u2019t hold it back any more. Her face was green. \u201cIf you think you can do it, then why don\u2019t you teach the class?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d The woman who had been getting water fell silent.\u201dMiss Xu, don\u2019t get angry. Xiao Liu was just making an offhand remark.\u201d Seeing the situation growing worse, the other teachers went over to console her. \u201cThis time, the class placements really were too much. Nobody wants to be the homeroom teacher of class 3.\u201dXu Xia was the homeroom teacher of class 2.3. She almost fainted when she first saw the class list.She had been in the teaching profession for over ten years. Even though she didn\u2019t have many outstanding accomplishments, her track record was always better than Xiao Liu\u2019s, and she thought that the school had no reason to put her on the spot like this. She wasn\u2019t aware that her forthright, think-before-you-speak, low-EQ personality had offended quite a lot of people.\u201cOn what basis? They made me responsible for a class like that, on what basis? Isn\u2019t this deliberately putting me on the spot?\u201d Xu Xia was so mad that she didn\u2019t even want to prepare for the class meeting later. \u201cWhat on earth was the school thinking? Did they want to let these two pieces of rat poop wreck my pot of congee?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Only then did she take the class register and go to class. It was already more than ten minutes past the class meeting\u2019s start time when she left the office.Xie Yu hadn\u2019t intended to be late. He had put away all his things, which had taken some time, before setting off for the school building. He had expected to be stopped in the classroom doorway and hadn\u2019t expected the form teacher to arrive even later than he did.As Xie Yu passed by the windows, the classroom, which had been lively with chattering, suddenly went silent. Everyone sat up straight and looked straight ahead, even though there was nothing written on the blackboard.\u201cClassmates, my surname is Liu and my name is Cunhao. That\u2019s right, Liu Cunhao. I\u2019m guessing that everyone has more or less heard stories about me. I was class rep of class 1.7 last year and I have a lot of experience with managing a class. But I hope that when we pick a class rep later, that you please don\u2019t pick me.\u201dEveryone was as quiet as chickens. The boy stood with his back to the windows, his words flowing continuously.He was quite a silver-tongued boy, and he gesticulated with his hands when he spoke. \u201cDon\u2019t pick me. Give the opportunity to someone who needs it more, especially someone who has never been class rep. I think we very much need to give them a chance to stretch themselves.\u201dThe people near him winked wildly, hinting to him to look out of the window, but Liu Cunhao didn\u2019t notice their intentions at all. \u201c\u2026All in all, don\u2019t pick me. What are you doing? Don\u2019t make eyes at me. I don\u2019t intend to have an early romance.\u201d\u2014Xie Yu raised a hand and knocked on the door.Liu Cunhao turned to look in the direction of the sound and was instantly rendered speechless. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dLiu Cunhao\u2019s deskmate lowered his voice and whispered, \u201cHao-ge, everyone was hinting so obviously, but you were so self-absorbed\u2026\u201dLiu Cunhao\u2019s heart contained hundreds and thousands of words he wasn\u2019t sure how to speak. All he could do was silently sit down and pretend nothing had ever happened. \u201cIf something\u2019s up couldn\u2019t you damn well say it directly? What did you wink and nudge for?\u201dXie Yu had become famous early on.When he first entered the school, the wild rumors that he had copied his exam answers had given him the status of a god of cheating in everyone\u2019s hearts.At first, the discussion went in this direction: This guy is powerful. Too powerful. Even in the high school entrance exams he dared to cheat. I heard that even if his original grades were multiplied by three, it wouldn\u2019t be enough to get into Er Zhong.Later, Xie Yu had skipped class and gotten into a fight outside school. One against five. The punishment was a public shaming in front of the school. It was posted on the noticeboard in big font for nearly a semester. With one fight, he had made his name.Right now, Xie Yu stood in the doorway with his bag slung over one shoulder and his hands stuck in his pockets. His expression was blank.The classroom was already full of people. Once people heard about the class placement situation, even the students on sick leave had asked the classmates they knew to reserve a seat for them with their bags. They were worried to death that when school started, a living King of Hell would be sitting next to them.Xie Yu glanced around. There were only two empty seats in the second column of the last row. So he walked toward the last row at a leisurely pace.Some students whispered to each other: \u201cIs this all right? Doesn\u2019t this mean the two of them will sit together? One mountain can\u2019t house two tigers. What if some chemical reaction happens between the two of them? Will the classroom explode?\u201d\u201cThen, do you want to go sit with Xie Yu?\u201d\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t want to die yet.\u201dAbout five or six minutes later, Xu Xia finally walked into class, books in hand. \u201cIs everyone here already? Who\u2019s missing?\u201dLiu Cunhao had said he didn\u2019t want to be the class rep, but he was used to being the class rep. His body didn\u2019t listen to his mind and he reflexively raised his hand and stood up. \u201cMiss Xu, one person isn\u2019t here yet.\u201dXie Yu had drunk some wine last night and was still groggy now. He pillowed his head on his arms and went to sleep.Xu Xia looked around, her gaze resting on a certain someone in the last row for a while before moving away with a frown. \u201cLet\u2019s not bother with the people who aren\u2019t here. After the class meeting, go downstairs to get your books. You know where to get them, right? Then I\u2019ll start with some items on the class meeting agenda\u2026\u201dXu Xia didn\u2019t want to bother with the person who was late, but the person who was late swaggered up to the door.\u201cReporting\u2014\u201d He Zhao stood in the doorway. He said very politely. \u201cSorry, I\u2019m late.\u201dThe silhouette in the doorway was eye-catching. Black T-shirt, dark blue jeans folded up at the ankles. When he spoke, his voice held a casual laugh. One could tell at a glance that he was a hot commodity fought over by girls every day. He was the type who would cause trouble but no one could stay mad at after taking one look at him.Not at all like a hooligan, lazy and languid and shapeless. He seemed quite alert.Xu Xia was surprised.She hadn\u2019t taught Xie Yu and He Zhao before, but she had heard the stories that had spread through the school. Her mental image of them had been of two boys who walked with a slouch, didn\u2019t have any skills, kicked tables and chairs, and didn\u2019t wear their clothes properly.Today, she had seen something new\u2014although her impression of Xie Yu was still only that of the back of his head.Xu Xia had a child who was almost in middle school, and her heart wasn\u2019t much like a young girl\u2019s any more. She had disliked He Zhao coming in and she still kind of disliked him. She was about to take out her anger on him, the words on the tip of her tongue, but before she could speak, He Zhao stretched out his hand and produced someone from behind. \u201cPlease, at least let me explain the reason I was late.\u201dRound Glasses stumbled out, unceremoniously dragged by He Zhao. \u201cHi everyone, I\u2019m Shen Jie from class 2.8. Today, I was suddenly taken ill in the corridor. I owe everything to brave Classmate He who lent a hand in my time of need. I have chronic\u2026 uh, chronic\u2026\u201dShen Jie, who had suddenly forgotten what illness he had, stammered for a long time.He Zhao reminded him: \u201cChronic non-atrophic gastritis.\u201d\u201cCouldn\u2019t you have given me a simpler one?\u201d Shen Jie said.He Zhao: \u201cThe longer the name the more serious it seems.\u201dXu Xia\u2019s stomach was full of anger she couldn\u2019t vent.These two were ignoring her like she was an idiot?\u201cYou two are so harmonized. Are you in an acapella group?\u201d She pointed to the audience. \u201cI don\u2019t want to waste everyone\u2019s time. Find an empty seat and sit down. Right there. Beside the one who\u2019s lying down and sleeping.\u201dXie Yu, who was lying on the desk and sleeping, twitched. He might have heard something, or perhaps he had felt several dozen pairs of eyes watching him. He raised his head and sat up, slowly opening his eyes. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe Zhao: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe atmosphere was a little strange.And very mysterious.Liu Cunhao passed a note to his deskmate. On it was written: Are they going to fight?His deskmate replied: I can already feel the ripples of power in the air. Very vicious.Under the gazes of ten thousand pairs of eyes, He Zhao only said one word: \u201cFriend?\u201dXie Yu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fate,\u201d He Zhao said. \u201cWhat a coincidence.\u201dAlthough no one knew what was going on, and no one knew when these two big bros had crossed the space between the West and East buildings to forge a friendship, all of Class 2.3 collectively heaved a sigh of relief.They had initially imagined a terrifying, heartrending scene where blood flowed like a river.Xu Xia went over some things: seating arrangements, class rep selection, and several pieces of homework to be done ahead of the next class. She concluded the first part of the meeting, saying that she hoped everyone would welcome the new semester with a fresh start.\u201cThere\u2019s still some time left. I\u2019ll go down the register. When your name is called, come up and briefly introduce yourself.\u201dAmidst the applause, He Zhao also leisurely clapped several times.Xie Yu was dizzy and lay down again.\u201cI\u2019m called Wan Da. I have many interests, such as reading, sports\u2026\u201d\u201cHi, everyone. My name is Xue Xisheng. I hope that everyone can fight together, strive, and improve.\u201d\u201cFu Pei.\u201d\u201cDing Lianghua\u2026\u201dHe Zhao listened for a while, then tapped Xie Yu\u2019s shoulder. He turned and asked, \u201cHey, do you know who Xie Yu is?\u201dXie Yu, lying on the desk, also turned to look at him. \u201cAh?\u201dThe student up front had a shy personality and spoke like a buzzing mosquito. He hemmed and hawed for a long time about his hobbies and interests before finally managing to say, \u201cSwimming.\u201d He walked away from the podium like he had put down a heavy burden.He Zhao added: \u201cIt\u2019s that guy, west building, that non-mainstream idiot who wears black nail polish.\u201dHe Zhao was somewhat curious about the West Building Big Bro of legend. He didn\u2019t much care for the pile of great accomplishments belonging to Xie Yu of the West, but the black nail polish had left a particularly deep impression for some reason. He had already looked around the class and could only sigh that wise people didn\u2019t show themselves; Xie Yu had removed the black nail polish and He Zhao couldn\u2019t see who it was.Xie Yu looked at him with a complicated expression.\u201cFriend, do you know him or not?\u201d He Zhao followed up. \u201c\u2026Actually, I\u2019m quite interested in him. If I have a chance, I want to go a couple rounds.\u201dXu Xia announced from the podium: \u201cNext, Xie Yu.\u201dXie Yu slowly and leisurely stood up without looking at He Zhao\u2019s face to see what expression he was wearing. He walked to the podium and used chalk to write the two words \u201cXie Yu\u201d on the blackboard. His handwriting was sharp and quite beautiful.Then he tossed the chalk back in the box, dusted off his hands, and made a short and sharp self-introduction: \u201cXie Yu. Also, I don\u2019t wear black nail polish.\u201dWhen Xie Yu said the last sentence, his gaze was fixed on a certain idiot. But that idiot surnamed He wasn\u2019t embarrassed at all. Even amidst the silence, as the whole audience wasn\u2019t sure what to say, the idiot took the lead and started applauding. The epitome of tact. \u201cGood! Well said!\u201dXie Yu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dFuck it.After Xie Yu finished his self-introduction and returned to his seat, He Zhao stared at Xie Yu\u2019s hands without even attempting to hide it. Xie Yu was bored and was doodling on some paper. Noticing he was being stared at, he threw down his pen. \u201cAre you sick.\u201dHe Zhao said: \u201cYou really don\u2019t wear it? The you in the legend isn\u2019t like that.\u201dIn the legends of the West Building Big Bro, the nail polish played a very important role. At least, the reason He Zhao had remembered the name Xie Yu was because of the non-mainstream nail polish.\u201cLegend my **.\u201dHe Zhao went straight for Xie Yu\u2019s hand. \u201cDon\u2019t move. Let me see.\u201dXie Yu hadn\u2019t expected he\u2019d go straight for him. By the time Xie Yu recovered, his hand was already grasped in He Zhao\u2019s.Xie Yu\u2019s hands looked quite elegant, even gentle.Clean, long-fingered with prominent bones. His nails were well-kept and neat.When Xie Yu was young and his living conditions had still been good, Gu Xuelan had suggested he learn to play the piano. She said that his fingers were slender and long, and thus very suitable for the piano. Later, after Xie Yu started happily raising his fists against others, some parents would bring their children to Xie Yu\u2019s house almost every day saying, \u2018what\u2019s up with your kid, why does he hit people?\u2019Gu Xuelan had never mentioned piano again.He Zhao had just caught the hand and hadn\u2019t even had the time to inspect it closely before Xie Yu straight up exploded. He snatched his hand back: \u201c\u2026Fuck, what the hell is your damage.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They pulled forward until their chests were right up against the side of the table, and only stopped when they were at the point their chests were tight and they almost couldn\u2019t draw breath. They did everything they could to put distance between them and the two big bros behind them.He Zhao: \u201cSurely you\u2019re overreacting. I just touched you.\u201d\u201cGet your ass the hell away,\u201d Xie Yu said. \u201cDon\u2019t casually touch me.\u201dHe Zhao didn\u2019t say anything, just stuck out his hand in front of Xie Yu.Xie Yu glanced at He Zhao and remembered He Zhao\u2019s line from before: \u2018I\u2019m quite interested in him\u2019. \u201cYou want to go a round?\u201d\u201cGo on, touch me. I\u2019m letting you touch me back.\u201dXie Yu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe last student finished their self-introduction and walked away. Xu Xia coughed, hinting to a certain two students to follow the classroom rules. \u201cWe\u2019ll end the class meeting here. Dorm students, remember to follow the school conduct rules. I don\u2019t want to spend time after class dealing with your extracurricular matters. Have some self-awareness.\u201dXu Xia handed out the timetable and some school notices, then said, \u201cLiu Cunhao, you be the temporary class rep. You have experience.\u201dLiu Cunhao\u2019s heart felt like ashes: \u201c\u2026 Ah, yes.\u201dNot even two minutes later, He Zhao asked again, \u201cHey, so what\u2019s the real story behind your nail polish?\u201dXie Yu thought: this person is really very frustrating.The incident of the black nail polish.Xie Yu hadn\u2019t realized it would leave such a heavy and colorful brushstroke upon his life story.About half a year ago, Black Water Street had held a dance competition.The Residents\u2019 Association put up banners in the streets calling for people to sign up. The advertising was very heavy-handed. However, going by the wording of the banners, it was obvious that this competition\u2019s target audience was not youths. On them was written, \u201cRegain your youth! Regain the confidence you had when you were young!\u201dAt that time, Da Mei had just received his acceptance letter from a U.S. university. Not long after, he would have to leave. He insisted that they sign up and participate before he leftZhou Dalei sure didn\u2019t know how to dance, and refused on the spot. \u201cI don\u2019t want to. It\u2019s too embarrassing. What are you thinking\u2014going to compete with a bunch of Residents\u2019 Association aunties in dancing? Are you mad?\u201dXie Yu also said, \u201cDa Mei, this is not up for discussion.\u201dNot only the Residents\u2019 Association aunties but even Xu Yanmei and Lei\u2019s mom had started making preparations for this dance competition.Aunt Mei had even dragged Xie Yu to the plaza to see their elegant, complex fan dance. They held green fans, the staves glittering in the light.When Lei\u2019s mom was young, she was said to be the most beautiful girl within ten kilometres and eight villages. But by now, she had eaten her way to more than 100 kilos. When they finished dancing, Xie Yu stood in the center of the plaza. With a hundred mixed emotions, he squeezed out two words: \u201c\u2026 Quite good.\u201dDa Mei was extraordinarily serious this time. They had thought that this was a fit of temporary enthusiasm, but Da Mei bugged them for three days.This had never happened before.Zhou Dalei begged: \u201cGive me a reason, Da Mei. Give me a reason that\u2019s stronger than my shame\u201dDa Mei sighed. \u201cBig bro, I\u2019m about to leave. You\u2019re so cruel. Won\u2019t you fulfill even this tiny wish of mine?\u201dZhou Dalei: \u201cYou might as well ask me to pluck the stars from the sky, little rascal.\u201dDa Mei: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dDa Mei then glanced at Xie Yu, who didn\u2019t say anything and straight up left. \u201cI\u2019m going home for dinner.\u201dIn the end, they didn\u2019t outlast the little rascal.Da Mei called the two of them out on a pitch-black night. They squatted at the corner of the street enduring the cold wind. Zhou Dalei pulled his clothes tighter, and bowed his head to protect his styled hair, but it was still blown about, making him look like an idiot.\u201cDa Mei, what are you doing? In the middle of the night?\u201d Zhou Dalei felt that sometimes even good friends needed to be taught a lesson. \u201cLooking for a beating?\u201dDa Mei squatted in front of them, back to the wind, controlling the emotions overwhelming him. \u201cActually, there\u2019s a girl I have a crush on, but I don\u2019t dare confess to her. You know it too, I\u2019m about to leave\u2026 LDR is too painful and I don\u2019t want to think about it. Not in this lifetime. But, before I leave, I want to let her remember a cool and handsome image of me.\u201dXie Yu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dZhou Dalei was also about the age to be seeking out love and romance, or maybe he was just blown silly by the cold wind at 3 a.m. With a sniff and some hesitation, he wavered: \u201cIs there no other way to show her the cool and handsome image of you? Is this the only way?\u201dIn the end, they did the competition.But when the three of them stood in line to register, the atmosphere was so awkward it almost suffocated them on the spot.\u201c\u2026 Old man, look at these three young guys.\u201d\u201cThese three young guys.\u201d\u201cYoung guys?\u201dXie Yu\u2019s trio: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dDa Mei was very sensitive to the trends of the zeitgeist. If time had permitted, he might even have fashioned a performing costume for himself. Instead, when he pulled out a bottle of black nail polish, Xie Yu refused: \u201cThis is the cool image you want to show off?\u201dDa Mei put the nail polish on and said, \u201cIt\u2019s damn cool, really. Xie-ge, please believe me. Last night I watched a lot of videos. The cool guys all dance like this.\u201dThanks to Da Mei, their stage image was not only at the very forefront of non-mainstream, but also contained many strange and odd elements.The day of the competition, Xie Yu skipped class.They hadn\u2019t rehearsed enough. Xie Yu\u2019s movements were awkward. Da Mei\u2019s dancing was elegant and graceful, but looked very humiliating. Zhou Dalei\u2013 don\u2019t mention him. Hid dancing was downright awful but he thought he was quite good.In the end, the three of them danced at the venue without knowing what they were doing. They didn\u2019t even remember the steps right, and found every way to crash into each other. They resented each other for getting in the way and restricting each other\u2019s creative freedom.The next day, in class, Xie Yu realized he hadn\u2019t removed the nail polish.Zhou Dalei was even worse off. He was participating in a small online competition, rather formal, even livestreamed to a small audience. That night, a few dozen thousand people saw his black-nail-polished hand holding the mouse, five black nails on his other hand clacking nonstop on the keyboard.These matters weren\u2019t that important. There was only one thing Xie Yu cared about more: up till Da Mei left, they didn\u2019t find out who the girl was.\u201cActually, maybe, I have a very daring guess. Do you think Da Mei fell for one of the middle-aged aunties? And an auntie from our Residents\u2019 Association at that? But he was shy, and worried that we would judge him with worldly eyes\u2026 Fuck, this is too far beyond the pale\u2026 but if not, then none of this makes sense. There were no girls in the audience at all.\u201dXie Yu hadn\u2019t gone into detail. He Zhao heard the gist and nodded. \u201cOh\u2026 for stage effect.\u201dThe tone of his voice was very obvious and Xie Yu said, \u201cYou seem very disappointed.\u201dHe Zhao said: \u201cAh\u2026 a little.\u201dXu Xia announced the end of the meeting and everyone hurried in all directions.Several boys had stood in the doorway of Class 3 for a while, laughing and talking. Now they pulled open the window, leaned in and yelled, \u201c\u2014He Zhao, let\u2019s go play basketball.\u201dBroadly speaking, He Zhao\u2019s people skills were pretty good.He had a personality that attracted bad friends. Although his \u2018hooligan\u2019 reputation was now earth-shaking, in first year, there were a bunch of guys whose friendships with him were solid as metal. They would get together to play sports, or go to an internet cafe to play online games.Shen Jie was among them. When Xu Xia left, she glanced coldly at him. Shen Jie was about to say \u201cLet\u2019s go play basketball,\u201d but before the words left his mouth they changed, mechanical and raw: \u201c\u2014I\u2019m not going. I\u2019ll watch you guys play. My stomach still hurts a bit.\u201dHe Zhao seemed to be in a good mood. He sat in his seat, angling his body backward, and waved to them: \u201cGo on, I\u2019ll see you on the court.\u201dHe bent and pulled a mask from his trouser pocket, and was about to put it on when he seemed to remember something. His movements halted and he asked casually, \u201cWant to play basketball?\u201dXie Yu stood up and walked out: \u201cNo.\u201dHe Zhao shrugged and didn\u2019t say anything.Xie Yu was almost to the door when He Zhao suddenly called his name from behind: \u201cXie Yu?\u201dXie Yu turned around, leaned against the doorframe, and looked at him. On his face was written \u201cSpit it out quickly\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019re very annoying.\u201dHe Zhao had already put on the mask: \u201cNothing. Just getting used to my new deskmate\u2019s name.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe Zhao continued, \u201cLet\u2019s take care of each other in future, deskmate.\u201dGu Xuelan called Xie Yu at six in the evening.\u201cHave you eaten dinner? Did you meet your teachers and friends?\u201d Gu Xuelan asked. \u201cHow is your deskmate?\u201dXie Yu had had a deskmate in first year, but after his reputation got worse and worse, the teachers had taken precautionary measures and let him sit alone. Gu Xuelan must have heard that he now had a deskmate, and quickly called to ask about it.Xie Yu internally said: \u2026 He\u2019s not much.But to avoid trouble, he said: \u201cAll right. Sunny, outgoing and likes sports. Though his grades aren\u2019t that good.\u201dGu Xuelan wasn\u2019t sure why her son who got last place in every exam would so casually look down on his new deskmate for having \u2018not that good\u2019 grades.She gave him another few reminders, the gist of which was to not get in trouble and to study hard. Xie Yu reacted neutrally, and didn\u2019t say anything aside from \u201cMm.\u201d\u201cThen I won\u2019t say any more,\u201d Gu Xuelan said. \u201cThink about it for yourself. Mom can\u2019t keep you in line any more. Almost grown up\u2026 don\u2019t be so reckless.\u201dXie Yu said: \u201cMm, you should rest early.\u201dXie Yu didn\u2019t get in trouble, but his sunny, outgoing deskmate who liked sports caused a big mess on the first day of school.\u2026\u2026Mischievous to a fault.He had gone to play basketball and managed to beat up a boy whose grades were stellar and who was always in the top three of the year.Xu Xia walked out of the faculty office. Her superiors were very angry and she had not been lectured like that in a very long time. They had asked her how she managed her classroom and her students, to have something like that happen on the first day of school, and she had had to stand there with her head bowed listening to the long telling-off. Out of frustration and embarrassment, her face went green for a while and then red for a while. When she entered the faculty office she slammed her tray heavily on the desk.The other teachers were shocked. They looked up at her, and seeing her terrible expression, for a while no one dared ask what had happened.At this time Liu Cunhao arrived to turn in the school notice his parents had signed. Xu Xia was so mad her face was blank and her tone was cold: \u201cIs He Zhao in the classroom? Call him over.\u201dLiu Cunhao was quite scared. Everyone said Xie Yu of the West was the more terrifying of the two, always going about alone and high and mighty, and that the one of the East was more down-to-earth and a more interesting guy.But Liu Cunhao was even more afraid of He Zhao.He had personally witnessed He Zhao fight.Liu Cunhao had still been in first year then. Halfway through class he had a stomachache, and he raised his hand to tell the teacher that he needed to use the toilet. He grabbed tissue and ran out, but when he reached the toilet door he saw a \u201cMaintenance\u201d sign.He was about to go downstairs to relieve his biological needs when he heard someone in the toilet begging for mercy: \u201cI was wrong\u2026 don\u2019t beat me, I was wrong\u2026\u201dLiu Cunhao paused a moment, then set one foot in and carefully glanced inside.He Zhao clasped a cigarette between two fingers and stood in front of a boy kneeling on the floor.Although He Zhao\u2019s uniform was neat and tidy, the word \u2018law-abiding had nothing in the slightest to do with him. He Zhao narrowed his eyes and spit out a cloud of smoke. When he wasn\u2019t smiling, his whole person radiated a bone-deep chill and a smothering sense of tyranny.\u2014Completely different from his usual gregarious, affable image.He Zhao flicked off the ash, dark clouds seeming to mass in his eyes. Then he squatted, grabbed the person by the hair, and forced him to look up. \u201cGot a lot of nerve, have you?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The point of that was to guard against teachers and enforce freedom of speech. In the schoolwide group chat, the various subject teachers were all present and some things couldn\u2019t be said. Some teachers got along with the students and were all right, but a middle-aged woman like Xu Xia who was often very stern and unsmiling, one could tell at a glance that there was a deep generational gap between them.Class 3\u2019s private group chat was a little different.Not only did they have to guard against the teachers, they also had to guard against a certain two characters who tyrannized the school.[Anonymous A]: \u2026I heard He Zhao beat up Yang Wenyuan?[Anonymous B]: My friend is in Yang Wenyuan\u2019s class. He said he was beaten up so badly he\u2019s still lying in the hospital now.[Anonymous C]: Yang Wenyuan from Class 8?The private group chat kept sending notifications. Liu Cunhao looked at the words, \u201cYang Wenyuan,\u201d and the scene in his memory that had once scared him down to his guts gradually merged with this name.\u201cDon\u2019t hit me\u2026 I was wrong\u2026\u201dHe Zhao grabbed the guy\u2019s hair and said softly, \u201cDidn\u2019t I warn you. Didn\u2019t I fucking warn you.\u201dYang Wenyuan knelt on the ground. He was a very skinny person and his face was covered in acne, all pits and bumps. The toilet\u2019s tiled floor was not clean and there were puddles of water on it. He cried as he said, \u201cPlease let me go.\u201dWhen Liu Cunhao told He Zhao to go to the faculty office, Shen Jie was visiting from the other class. He had found himself a chair and sat beside He Zhao, and didn\u2019t seem to feel at all like he was someone from another class: \u201c\u2026Hey, you by the window, could you please close the blinds?\u201dHe Zhao said, \u201cWho are you ordering about? Go close them yourself.\u201dShen Jie stood up, closed the blinds, and sat back down. He had gym class next and was very bored. Seeing He Zhao holding his phone and not putting it down, he asked out of curiosity, \u201cZhao-ge, what game are you playing?\u201dHe Zhao ignored him, scooched over to Xie Yu, and showed him the screen. \u201cAce, come up with another strategy for me?\u201dXie Yu delivered two words to him: \u201cGet lost.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dShen Jie was impossibly curious. \u201cLet me see. I\u2019ll do it. I\u2019ll find you a strategy.\u201d\u201cGet lost,\u201d He Zhao said. \u201cGo back to your own class, it\u2019s cooler there\u201dShen Jie was persistent and didn\u2019t give up, and finally he caught a glimpse of it. A pink interface. A cartoon girl with long loose hair wore white underwear and stood beside a closet, blinking.Shen Jie was stunned speechless. \u201cThis\u2026 is this that\u2026 that\u2026\u201d\u201cThe dressup game countless elementary school girls are crazy about,\u201d Xie Yu said calmly.He Zhao played the game through the whole class period, and Xie Yu was also pestered by him for the whole class period.Every time He Zhao confidently finished matching up an outfit, his score was unsatisfactory. He tried one level many times and eventually tossed his phone in front of Xie Yu: \u201cDeskmate, help a guy out?\u201dMatching clothes was like playing cards: both needed a little luck. Xie Yu was annoyed beyond belief and picked several pieces at random. \u201cAre you stupid\u2026 A game like this? ID SoftLittleCutie? You\u2019re going very far with this act.\u201dXie Yu finished his selection. When the score appeared, it was unexpectedly high.\u201cAce,\u201d He Zhao\u2019s praise was sincere. \u201cThis set of clothes looks so ugly but it got such a high score.\u201dShen Jie felt the world waver around him. He would rather believe something was wrong with his own taste. \u201cAh? This game\u2026 is fun? What\u2019s special about it?\u201dHe Zhao was minutely scrutinizing the next set of clothes and ignored him.Xie Yu copied the homework, closed his textbook, and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s so special? It\u2019s especially idiotic.\u201dLiu Cunhao entered the classroom through the back door and stood in front of He Zhao. \u201cGo to the faculty office. Miss Xu\u2019s looking for you.\u201dHe Zhao made a noise of assent and ignored him completely. After a while he looked up and found Liu Cunhao still standing in front of him. \u201c\u2026Was there anything else?\u201dLiu Cunhao had held his words in for a long time, and finally he plucked up the courage to say: \u201cDon\u2019t think you can do as you please.You beat up Yang Wenyuan this badly\u2026\u201dShen Jie hurriedly cut in: \u201cWait. Yang Wenyuan? What?\u201dThe classroom was very noisy during the ten minutes between classes and nobody noticed what they were talking about in the corner.He Zhao had understood. He smiled, put his phone away, and said thoughtfully, \u201cAh, so it\u2019s like that.\u201dShen Jie: \u201c\u2026Like what?\u201dXie Yu considered himself an uninvolved bystander and didn\u2019t react at all.Liu Cunhao was very scared, but he was determined. For quite some time he had chastised himself for not putting a stop to things when he saw his classmate being bullied. His first reaction had been to turn tail and run. His new dislike stacked with his old grudges and he felt a rush of determination.He Zhao\u2019s expression was chilly and Liu Cunhao was terrified that he really had provoked him.But He Zhao just tossed his phone to Xie Yu. \u201cHelp a guy out, play two more rounds for me. I have to beat that person, Creme Brulee, in my friends list.\u201dXie Yu had the phone in his hand, and before he could refuse, He Zhao left.The bell chimed, signalling the start of class.Shen Jie dragged his chair out of the classroom, murmuring in confusion: \u201c\u2026Beat up what person? When did Zhao-ge beat up Yang Wenyuan? He didn\u2019t. Am I losing my memory?\u201dAfter He Zhao left, he didn\u2019t come back to class all day.When he came back the next day, it was as if nothing had happened.A teacher couldn\u2019t bear it and asked Xu Xia, \u201cMiss Xu, that matter with He Zhao from your class\u2014what happened? Is it settled?\u201dXu Xia said tiredly, \u201cHe\u2019ll die before he admits it. What can I do with him?\u201dAt the faculty office, He Zhao\u2019s expression remained blank. He had asked the inspection officer to ask Yang Wenyuan for the medical report and describe clearly how he had gotten each of his injuries.Yang Wenyuan was so terrified he couldn\u2019t speak.Xu Xia felt that this matter didn\u2019t warrant investigation at all. Anyone with a brain could tell at a glance what had happened. She asked He Zhao to admit his mistake, apologize, and write a reflection essay. After this punishment, the matter would be concluded.He Zhao was clearly unwilling. Although he smiled, his tone was cold beyond belief: \u201cApologize for what? Goody-two-shoes Yang, you\u2019re very good at touching porcelain. \u00b9 The moment your lips touch, you say I beat you up.\u201dXu Xia couldn\u2019t take thinking back to the situation any more. She waved a hand: \u201cLet\u2019s not talk about him. When we talk about him, my chest hurts.\u201d\u201cHave you beaten Creme Brulee yet?\u201d He Zhao was very focused. The moment the class bell rang, he walked in through the rear door, stood next to Xie Yu, and crooked a finger. He bent over and knocked on Xie Yu\u2019s side of the desk. \u201cHey.\u201dXie Yu always used the morning self-study period to catch up on sleep, and now he got a headache from the knocking. \u201cBeaten, my ass. Go play it yourself.\u201dHe Zhao sat down and asked, \u201cSo where\u2019s my phone?\u201dXie Yu dug in his desk drawer, found the phone, and tossed it over.He Zhao caught it with one hand. When he tried to turn it on, he found it was out of power.Yesterday\u2019s incident between He Zhao and Yang Wenyuan caused a ruckus in their class year and rumors flew all around.Rumor had it that these two school tyrants always caused problems, but usually their conflicts were with people outside school. These fights weren\u2019t happening right next to them, so people could treat them as rumors and discuss it over lunch, exclaiming, \u201cbadass,\u201d several times.But He Zhao had now shown his entire hand and the person he had beaten up was someone recognized by the whole year as a good student.[Anonymous A]: He came to class today\u2026 Wah, he\u2019s talking to Xie Yu.[Anonymous A] \u25a1\u25a1 and with Xie Yu at that. Fearless. Terrifying. I don\u2019t dare move.[Anonymous B]: Yang Wenyuan got out of the hospital today. Shen Jie grabbed him by the collar in class and called him shameless\u2026 Is there really some hidden goings-on?[Anonymous C]: What hidden goings-on can there be? Embarrassment and frustration just turned into anger, that\u2019s all. Shen Jie isn\u2019t a good student, either.Xie Yu slept through the morning self-study period.He Zhao had borrowed a portable phone charger from someone and sat off to the side with his head bowed, playing on his phone.The class after morning self-study was Xu Xia\u2019s class. The moment she entered the classroom she pointed at He Zhao and said, \u201cYou go outside and listen to class from there. Stand in the doorway and don\u2019t come into the classroom.\u201dWhen the students in class saw Xu Xia\u2019s manner, their guesses as to what had happened in \u201cthe fighting incident\u201d became more and more certain.Most likely, He Zhao was indeed the culprit.He Zhao didn\u2019t much care. Without a word, he took his phone and the phone charger and walked right out.Xie Yu glanced at his departing back. It was the same school uniform the entire school wore, but He Zhao still managed to cut a figure of a good student in it. Narrow waist, straight back, clean clothes, and he didn\u2019t do as others did and pull the jacket zipper down low. Only the phone he held in his hand and the long charging cord betrayed his true nature.He Zhao might have felt someone looking at him, because when he got to the doorway he glanced back.Before Xie Yu could turn away, he heard Xu Xia say from the podium, \u201cXie Yu, you miss your deskmate that much?\u201dXie Yu, who had taken the bullet even though he was innocent: \u201c\u2026the fuck?\u201d\u201cIf you miss him so much, then you go out, too. Go and stand with him,\u201d Xu Xia continued. \u201cGo.\u201dIn the doorway of classroom 2.3, two people stood throughout the first morning period.\u201cQuite faithful, aren\u2019t you.\u201d He Zhao had found a corner, and as the phone charged he kept playing the dressup game. He looked down as he said, \u201cMissed me?\u201dNext to him, Xie Yu really wasn\u2019t sure what to say. He replied with a single sound, pregnant with meaning: \u201cHeh.\u201dHe Zhao: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dXie Yu didn\u2019t much want to look at Xu Xia whose resentment was written all over her face.Since the day he came back to school, he had felt it. This form teacher clearly had preconceived notions about them. Regardless of what actually happened during He Zhao\u2019s incident, and who was in the right and who was in the wrong, she had already used this incident to draw conclusions about Xie Yu, this as-yet unexploded dangerous material whom she didn\u2019t like the look of, either. She felt that these two were of a kind.Looking at Xu Xia rolling her eyes at them nonstop, he worried she\u2019d injure her eyes.\u201cAce, take a look. Is this checkered skirt better or that pink one?\u201d He Zhao was so dedicated to this dressup game, it was almost touching. \u201cOr a different outfit entirely?\u201dXie Yu watched him play for a while and came to a conclusion about a \u2018rule\u2019 that couldn\u2019t really be termed a rule: \u201cPick the uglier one.\u201dHe Zhao asked, \u201cAre you serious?\u201dXie Yu: \u201cI think that with your aesthetic sense, if you play this game backwards, you might get some unexpected results.\u201dIt was clearly a diss, but He Zhao actually took it to heart. He thought about it for a while and said, \u201cDamn, I think this approach of yours is not bad.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYou have some pretty good ideas.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Xu Xia finished the lesson and picked up her materials to leave the room, and He Zhao even said good-naturedly, \u201cSee you, Miss Xu.\u201dXu Xia\u2019s chest was tight and she found it hard to breathe. She ignored it and kept walking.\u201cDo you know why she\u2019s angry?\u201d He Zhao was in quite a good mood. He put a hand on Xie Yu\u2019s shoulder and they walked to class together. \u201cShe\u2019s preparing to transfer to the Experimental High School, a municipal key school. Made all her connections and everything. Now, a good student under her tutelage\u2014which is to say, me\u2014is standing in her way\u2026\u201dXie Yu was uninterested in gossip. \u201cTake your hand off me.\u201dHe Zhao felt that this deskmate of his was really cruel.He had initially just put a hand on Xie Yu\u2019s shoulder. On hearing Xie Yu\u2019s complaint, he slung his whole arm around Xie Yu. From an outsider\u2019s point of view they might have been hugging. \u201cNot letting go.\u201dXie Yu was about to kick him when He Zhao buried his head in Xie Yu\u2019s neck and laughed. \u201cCalm down, friend.\u201d\u201cCalm down, your grandpa.\u201d[Anonymous A]: Classmates, there\u2019s a situation in the three o\u2019clock direction.[Anonymous B]: woc,\u00b9 I saw it. What are they doing?[Anonymous C]: I\u2019d rather believe that the two of them are fighting\u2026.Xie Yu, who wasn\u2019t yet aware of the private group chat, thought their new class was a little strange.Sometimes everyone in the class went quiet at the same time and the classroom would be entirely silent. When they were done with the silence, they would raise their heads and look at each other with a sense of tacit understanding. Very mysterious.He Zhao had borrowed the portable phone charger from a boy in the next row. He went to return it but the boy didn\u2019t dare to take it, looking like he wanted to just offer up the charger and be done with things.He Zhao put it on the desk: \u201cThanks.\u201d\u201c\u2026No, no problem.\u201d The boy spoke in a high-pitched whine. His hands were under his desk, hiding something, and his whole body was extremely tense. He Zhao didn\u2019t hear what he was saying and was about to ask, but the moment he opened his mouth the guy gave a full-body flinch.He Zhao: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Am I that terrifying.Only after He Zhao had walked away did the guy carefully take his phone back out.In the blink of an eye, two weeks had passed since school started.Xie Yu watched wide-eyed as He Zhao got better and better at the dressup game. Everything he matched up got a high score.It was unimaginable.Had his offhand remark really let He Zhao discover the path to enlightenment?\u201cNah. I tried your tactic and it didn\u2019t save me.\u201d He Zhao he took a screenshot of his highest score to date, then exited the game. Calmly, he said to his deskmate, \u201cI paid.\u201dHe Zhao continued, \u201cI, your deskmate, am the legendary Renminbi player.\u201d\u00b2Xie Yu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe Zhao: \u201cI\u2019m so strong now I even scare myself.\u201dXie Yu said mockingly, \u201cSoftLittleCutie, you really surprise me.\u201d\u201cI paid fair and square. Is it so shameful to pay?\u201d As He Zhao spoke, the shoulders of the guys in the row in front of them started shaking.They sat very close to the row behind and clearly heard everything Xie Yu and He Zhao said to each other.They had listened in for two weeks. Sometimes, they really wanted to laugh till they couldn\u2019t stop. But they were worried that they\u2019d laugh too much and catch the big bros\u2019 attentions, so they endured it.Time passed and the two of them felt that the school tyrants were nothing like the rumors made them out to be. They were even\u2026 kind of cute.When the school tyrants slept in class, they asked their deskmate to help keep an eye on the teacher. Tyrant Xie usually ignored Tyrant He, but every time the teacher called He Zhao to stand up or stand in the doorway as punishment, He Zhao always had a hundred excuses and made Xie Yu back him up.After this happened several times, Xie Yu finally started taking He Zhao\u2019s unreasonable requests seriously. When a teacher passed by, he rolled up his book and gave He Zhao a hard greeting to the back of his head: \u201cGet up.\u201dAs He Zhao spoke, he opened QQ and posted a status to brag about his battle record: [/Image][/Cool]He sent the message, then something occurred to him and he rapped on Xie Yu\u2019s side of the desk: \u201cAdd me?\u201dXie Yu refused politely: \u201cI don\u2019t want the words SoftLittleCutie to appear in my friends list.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe Zhao choked: \u201c\u2026Who said SoftLittleCutie is my account?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s my little sister,\u201d He Zhao continued. \u201cYou misunderstand me very deeply. All along I thought that with my tall and imposing image I shouldn\u2019t have to explain this sort of thing.\u201dHe Zhao had a little sister who had just started middle school.This girl was obsessed with dressup games, but she only got an hour of time to play phone games at home. From Monday to Friday, which were school days, she didn\u2019t even get to touch her phone. She said she was very envious of her good friend Creme Brulee\u2019s level and score. Besides, in their class, whoever\u2019s level was highest in the dressup game was the one who was admired and loved in class.Xie Yu\u2019s temple began to throb.He Zhao said: \u201cI think this girl might have tricked me.\u201dHe Zhao\u2019s QQ name was his real name. Surprisingly formal.After accepting the friend request, Xie Yu didn\u2019t change the settings on the contact. He just tossed him in one of the categories and left him there.He Zhao, the maniac, on the other hand: he was sitting right there but still sent Xie Yu a text. \u201cAre you a GG or a MM?\u201d\u00b3\u201cAre you stupid?\u201d Xie Yu said, holding back the impulse to block him.He Zhao put away his phone, smiling. \u201cOne has to be polite when socializing online. Everyone says hi like that.\u201d\u201cQuiet\u2014\u201d During the break between classes, Xu Xia walked in. It was noisy in the doorway and she had to raise her voice when she spoke. \u201cI have something next class period, so Miss Wang will substitute. I won\u2019t be around in the afternoon, either, so if you have any questions, go to the class rep and the class rep will report to me tomorrow. Class rep, remember to maintain order in the class, do you hear?\u201d[Anonymous A]: What happened now?[Anonymous B]: \u2026To tell you the truth, if she keeps getting substitutes she should at least explain to them where we are in the curriculum. Every time we go to class it\u2019s awkward.[Anonymous C]: Did something happen at home for Miss Xu?Xu Xia\u2019s family was doing well. Since starting school, she had been preparing for the transfer.Their class was the one with the worst grades among the culture classes, and their situation was also unusual. When the school had given this class to Xu Xia, it was because they believed in her ability\u2026 but Xu Xia stubbornly believed the school was giving her a hard time.This \u201celite teacher\u201d who was about to go to an important school to teach naturally didn\u2019t look kindly upon this class, and didn\u2019t give much more thought to it. The students in the class weren\u2019t blind, either, and their distaste towards her grew day by day.The phone under the desk vibrated twice and He Zhao glanced down at it.Two messages.-Zhao-ge, Yang Wenyuan has been in Xu Xia\u2019s company these few days. You\u2019d best be careful.-If Xu Xia doesn\u2019t settle this matter with you, the Experimental High School definitely won\u2019t let her transfer in that smoothly. They\u2019ll say she can\u2019t teach, and even that relative of hers won\u2019t be able to protect her. She\u2019ll probably to do something about this matter of you beating up Goody-two-shoes Yang.When the last class of the morning let out, Shen Jie slipped in through the rear door to ask He Zhao to the cafeteria for lunch. When he entered, he saw that He Zhao\u2019s seat was empty. He turned and asked Xie Yu, \u201cBig bro, where\u2019s Zhao-ge?\u201d\u201cHim?\u201d Xie Yu said. \u201cHe skipped class.\u201dShen Jie looked at Xie Yu hopefully, indicating for him to continue. \u201cMm\u2026?\u201dXie Yu sat in his seat. He planned to go to the cafeteria after the crowds had thinned. He was halfway through a rhythm game and had turned the sound off, but not being able to hear the rhythm of the music didn\u2019t stand in his way at all; his fingers tapped on the screen at an incredible speed.Shen Jie internally said, Of course I know he skipped class, but where did he go after he skipped class?Xie Yu finished the game and found that Shen Jie was still standing there.\u201cYou wanted to ask where He Zhao went?\u201d Xie Yu remembered, then continued, \u201cHow would I know? None of my business.\u201d\u201cReally cold.\u201d\u201cNot humane at all.\u201d\u201cLike an emotionless killer.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dShen Jie searched from the toilets to the rooftops and finally found He Zhao in the boys\u2019 dormitory. After a long spiel of complaints he finally concluded: \u201cYour deskmate is really heartless.\u201dWhen Shen Jie finished, he noticed that He Zhao didn\u2019t react.He closed the dorm room door and turned to see his Zhao-ge sitting in a chair, one long leg bent at the knee with his foot on the edge of the chair. He had undone quite a few buttons of his school uniform and looked absolutely wild.Shen Jie asked, \u201cWild Boy?\u201d\u201cWild my ass. Whether my deskmate has a heart is not for you to say.\u201d He Zhao had slept through two class periods and had just crawled out of his blankets. He ruffled his hair, then asked, \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\u201cAsking you to lunch, of course. If I have lunch with you, I don\u2019t need to stand in line,\u201d Shen Jie said. \u201cThe feeling of schoolmates letting you cut the line is really good, isn\u2019t it?\u201dHe Zhao was clearly in a bad mood. After ruffling his hair, his hand fell back to his side and paused before going to the box of lollipops on the table.\u201cSmoke these.\u201d Shen Jie stuck out his hand and pushed the box full of lollipops away, then pulled out a pack of cigarettes from his pocket and handed them to He Zhao along with a lighter. \u201cIt\u2019s all right to smoke occasionally. Even if you\u2019re quitting, take it slow.\u201dHe Zhao held the hard paper box. After a moment, he tossed the cigarettes back and Shen Jie was fast enough to catch them. \u201c\u2026Ah, you throw quite accurately. You\u2019re really not gonna smoke?\u201dHe Zhao said: \u201cNo.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t think Zhao-ge was actually a person with principles.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve always had principles, all right?\u201d He Zhao picked a lollipop, unwrapped it, and tossed it in his mouth. \u201cDon\u2019t tempt me. It\u2019s no use.\u201dAfter Shen Jie caught the box, he himself picked out a stick and smoked it.He lowered his head and held the cigarette close. The lighter clicked and he took a deep drag. After some silence he said: \u201cI got the news, too. Yang Wenyuan, that bastard. I really can\u2019t stop thinking about killing him. The moment he heard Liu Yuan was transferring schools, the bastard started making trouble and even tried to drag you into the water. He\u2019s tired of living.\u201dHe Zhao, with the lollipop in his mouth, said nothing.\u201cYour form teacher is an idiot, too. She taught Yang Wenyuan in first year, and after seeing that his grades were good she treated him like her own son. She doesn\u2019t even see what this good student\u2019s true colors really are. Now her own resume isn\u2019t exciting enough and she can\u2019t get into the elite school, so she wants to offer you up as a sacrifice?\u201d Shen Jie flicked off cigarette ash and continued, \u201cIf I may say, Zhao-ge, you might as well spill Yang Wenyuan\u2019s dirty laundry and be done with it. If he has the guts to fall on the barrel of a gun, no one can say who\u2019ll die in the end.\u201d\u201cSpill what,\u201d He Zhao said. \u201cThe matter with Liu Yuan, we can\u2019t talk about it..\u201dShen Jie took his last drag on the cigarette and sighed. \u201c\u2026Fuck.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He Zhao couldn\u2019t stand the smell any more; he hadn\u2019t successfully quit smoking yet, after all. He lifted a hand and pointed at the door: \u201cIf you want to smoke, do it outside. Scram.\u201dShen Jie said: \u201cIt\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t want to smoke, but you\u2019re restricting my freedom\u2026\u201dHe Zhao tossed a pillow at him.Shen Jie reacted quickly and dodged to the side.As they were talking, He Zhao\u2019s phone on the table lit up, accompanied by the \u2018ding-dong\u2019 of a message notification. After a few seconds the screen went dark again.He Zhao scooped up the phone and checked it. Xie Yu had sent seven words and a punctuation mark.\u2013 An official will observe class this afternoon.\u201cWho is it?\u201d Shen Jie leaned forward and asked.He Zhao glanced down and typed, saying, \u201cThe emotionless killer.\u201dShen Jie didn\u2019t have a strong impression of Xie Yu. He\u2019d only started associating with the guy after the latter had become He Zhao\u2019s deskmate.The first impression he had of Xie Yu was that, although he was damn good-looking, he wasn\u2019t easy to interact with. Now\u2026 after interacting with him, his first impression was confirmedHis Zhao-ge was the only exception.\u201cHe\u2019s only emotionless towards you.\u201d He Zhao finished replying, then generously showed Shen Jie the screen. \u201cSee that? My deskmate is as warm as springtime to me.\u201dShen Jie thought that this event was probably not as warm as He Zhao thought it was.As Shen Jie left Class 2.3, he had personally witnessed Xie Yu tear out a piece of paper in absolute frustration, write several big words, and toss it on He Zhao\u2019s desk. Perhaps too many people had come to ask about He Zhao\u2019s whereabouts that morning. On that piece of paper was scrawled messily: Not around, skipped class, I don\u2019t know.It was the first time Shen Jie had seen someone announce so blatantly that his deskmate had skipped class. Truly, a talent.In reality, the matter was indeed not that warm.When an official observed class, they usually informed the school beforehand and even picked the specific day so that the teachers could prepare for every question-and-answer session. But this time around it had happened too suddenly. Xu Xia placed an urgent call back to ask Miss Wang from the class next door to look after Class 2.3 for her; no one could be absent.Miss Wang went to class 2.3 and looked around. She stood next to the piece of paper on He Zhao\u2019s desk for a long time, then asked Xie Yu to get in touch with him. If they really couldn\u2019t get him back, they\u2019d say he was on sick leave.With less than ten minutes to afternoon class, He Zhao tidied his clothes and walked out. On the way out, he noticed Shen Jie was still in a daze and said, \u201cWhat are you standing there for? Go to class.\u201dShen Jie answered, \u201cAh,\u201d but suddenly stopped when he got to the door. He asked, \u201cWhat do we do about this? If we can\u2019t talk about Liu Yuan, how do we settle your issue?\u201dThe conversation had circled back again.He Zhao stuck his hands in his pockets and said, \u201cLet\u2019s talk about it another time.\u201dAs expected, the matter of Yang Wenyuan returned as a topic of conversation before long.Firstly, Xu Xia took Yang Wenyuan to the school officials and said that this matter couldn\u2019t be dropped just like that. Later, Yang Wenyuan\u2019s parents even came to the school to demand an explanation.\u201cJust look at my son\u2019s face and arms. It\u2019s evil. How can there be such a person in the school?\u201dYang Wenyuan\u2019s parents both wore glasses and looked like intellectuals, but when they opened their mouths that was very much not the case. \u201cI heard this He Zhao from your school makes trouble all the time? It\u2019s no wonder at all that he beat our son up. Why has he not been dealt with yet? What are all of you doing?\u201dHe Zhao\u2019s form teacher Xu Xia stood to the side with a dark face. \u201cWe do take all responsibility for this matter. I will teach him properly. As of now, I can only gravely apologize to you. A student from my class made a mistake\u2026\u201dHe Zhao really couldn\u2019t keep listening.\u201cTeach?\u201d He Zhao was so angry he laughed. \u201cDo you have the right to teach anyone?\u201d\u201c\u2014How can you talk to a teacher like that?\u201dThe matter was at a stalemate, but at this juncture a witness appeared.Liu Cunhao knocked on the door and entered. \u201cMiss Xu, you were looking for me?\u201dWhen Liu Cunhao returned from the guidance center he was immediately mobbed by the class. \u201cClass rep, we heard you testified in court?\u201d\u201cDid you really see He Zhao beat up Yang Wenyuan with your own eyes?\u201dLiu Cunhao corrected: \u201cBefore. I saw it before.\u201d\u201cBadass. Brave warrior.\u201dThe crowd was abuzz. Everyone said that if it had been them, they wouldn\u2019t dare risk their lives to speak up.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, it\u2019s nothing,\u201d Liu Cunhao said. \u201cI hesitated for a while, too, but for the sake of love and justice\u2026\u201dXie Yu didn\u2019t like passing judgment on things like these. It had nothing to do with him anyway.What one saw with one\u2019s eyes might not always be true, especially when it came to rumors like these.Before he came to Black Water Street to avoid debt collectors, he had thought that the people who lived there were all good-for-nothings and hooligans. But he really had nowhere else to go. The day he got there, Xu Yanmei with her tattoos and her potty mouth had knocked on the door with a bowl of dumplings. \u201cMade a few extra. They\u2019re not that good, so eat them with something else.\u201dAfter this first gesture of caring, she had taken care of them for almost ten years.\u201cWhat happened? What\u2019s the situation now, really?\u201dLiu Cunhao said, \u201c\u2026He might be expelled. This time it\u2019s quite serious.\u201d\u201cExpelled?!\u201dWhile the class was chatting up a storm, Xie Yu lay on his desk and played on his phone.After a long time, He Zhao was let out of the guidance center and returned to class. Liu Cunhao was at the podium solving a math problem as He Zhao walked into the classroom. Out of the corner of his eye he saw He Zhao\u2019s silhouette and the chalk in his hand snapped.Surprisingly, He Zhao didn\u2019t even look at him.Liu Cunhao secretly let out a breath.Xie Yu was slightly suspicious as to whether or not the punishment they were talking about\u2014expulsion\u2014was true or not. Because when He Zhao returned, he was still in the mood to keep playing the dressup game.Shen Jie reacted even more strongly than He Zhao, as if he was the one to be expelled. \u201cFuck that shit. Where did your class rep pop up from?!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s that noise for? He\u2019s an okay guy,\u201d He Zhao said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t his fault.\u201dShen Jie: \u201cSo what\u2019s the situation now, really? They let you out to give you time to think, and they want you to apologize and write a reflection essay, right? Xu Xia is that stubborn? Is her professional life just lacking one damn thing, your reflection essay?\u201dThe two classes had the same gym period. The two crossed the football field and walked toward the stadium.Shen Jie talked up a storm. He Zhao might or might not have been listening; seeing Xie Yu sitting under the shade of a tree, he lifted his hand to wave to him.Xie Yu heard someone calling his name and had just looked up when a ball flew out from the basketball field and said hi to his head. \u201c\u2026..\u201dA guy walked off the basketball court. \u201cHand slipped, sorry.\u201dShen Jie looked at the person\u2019s face and immediately exploded. \u201cFucking Yang Wenyuan, you did it on purpose, right?\u201dHe hadn\u2019t even thrown accurately. Going by the angle it was obvious he had been aiming for He Zhao.He Zhao said nothing. He bent, picked the ball up, walked to Xie Yu\u2019s side, then threw the ball hard in Yang Wenyuan\u2019s direction. The ball grazed Yang Wenyuan and smashed into the metal fence, making a loud bang. He Zhao smiled and returned the courteous words: \u201cHand slipped.\u201dYang Wenyuan\u2019s friend came over to join the fray and tugged at him, urging him to leave. \u201cSorry, sorry.\u201dBut Yang Wenyuan stood on the spot and didn\u2019t move. He was as thin as a rail and his clothes seemed to hang off his very bones. His face was long and pockmarked and he had dark bags under his eyes; he looked very sickly. As he stood there he finally forced out the words: \u201cHe Zhao, this isn\u2019t over. You\u2019re going to lose.\u201dHe Zhao: \u201cCut the bullshit and get lost.\u201d\u201cDo you know why?\u201d Yang Wenyuan smiled. \u201cBecause your grades suck.\u201d\u201cDamn you.\u201d The words \u2018your grades suck\u2019 seem to have hit a raw nerve, or perhaps the feelings he had bottled up over the past few days had finally found an outlet. He Zhao walked up slowly and asked in a low voice, \u201cYou don\u2019t understand human speech, do you?\u201dHe Zhao rarely got angry.Shen Jie had known him for many years and hadn\u2019t seen him angry more than a few times. He Zhao\u2019s demeanor was very good-natured; even if the other person got mad, he wouldn\u2019t. Going from this perspective, Yang Wenyuan really was a talent.\u201cLet\u2019s go, Wenyuan. Let\u2019s go.\u201d Even if Yang Wenyuan wanted to court death, his friends certainly didn\u2019t, and they dragged him away.Shen Jie really wanted to roll up his sleeves and get down to business. But he considered that He Zhao was currently in a precarious situation. If he made any more trouble, those rumors could become reality. \u201cZhao-ge, calm down. You have to calm down. If you want to beat him up, we\u2019ll have to find a dark deserted alley and put a sack over his head, then we can beat him up however we want.\u201dShen Jie let go only when Yang Wenyuan had gone out of sight.\u201cThat\u2019s Yang Wenyuan?\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Shen Jie looked back and saw the emotionless killer standing to the side. He replied, \u201cAh, Goody-two-shoes Yang, that\u2019s him.\u201dXie Yu had been trying to recall something; the guy felt familiar. By the time he finally put a name to the face, he said blank-faced, \u201cAh. Isn\u2019t that the idiot who sexually harassed a girl?\u201dHe Zhao: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dShen Jie: \u201c\u2026How did you know?!\u201d\u201cFriend, can we talk?\u201d Shen Jie recovered from the enormous blow. \u201cHow do you know about this? Did you know Liu Yuan? Fuck, I thought that in the whole school only me and Zhao-ge knew.\u201dXie Yu only said three words: \u201cI saw it.\u201dIt was when Xie Yu was in his first year.The cell service from the west building wasn\u2019t good. If people wanted to use their phones, they had to rely on fate and destiny or carry their phones around looking for a signal.Zhou Dalei had still been livestreaming at the time. His career had just gotten started and he wasn\u2019t that popular, so he had reminded Xie Yu to tune in on time and increase his hit count. Xie Yu looked for a signal all the way to the toilet, where the signal was not bad, but the environment was really a little unbearable.\u201cBoss Xie, I believe in your love for me. It surpasses excrement and urine\u2026\u201d Dalei said as he played his game. \u201cReally. This is the time for you to show how much you love me.\u201dLove, your ass. Fuck.Xie Yu gave Dalei a virtual present and was about to leave, but Dalei talked a lot of crap and insisted on chatting with him, saying that it was lonely without interacting with the audience and he needed Boss Xie to liven the atmosphere for him.This \u2018livening the atmosphere\u2019 lasted all the way until the evening self-study period.Dalei: \u201cIf you like the streamer, give me a present! Is there anyone around? Am I that unpopular?\u201dXie Yu was typing: Go be lonely on your own. I\u2019m leaving.Before he could send it, the toilet door was kicked open with a bang, followed by the sound of shoving and a girl\u2019s soft cry.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 38": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fake SlackersChapter 017 - Life is always full of surprisesPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayFake SlackersTranslator: JuryEditor: NomNomFirst Published on Chaleuria\u2014017 \u2013 Life is always full of surprisesThey found a secluded place: a grassy field near the equipment room with a large rock mimicking a mountain at its center. The three squatted, resting against the \u2018mountain.\u2019Xie Yu was about to stand up when He Zhao pulled him back down. \u201cStay right there. Talk. Keep talking.\u201dActually, there wasn\u2019t much to say.Xie Yu didn\u2019t know anyone called Liu Yuan. He just remembered that the girl had buried her face in her hands, squatted on the floor, and cried.Yang Wenyuan was terrified and didn\u2019t dare face Xie Yu head on. After two blows from a stick, he turned and ran out. Xie Yu had no intention of squatting and comforting the girl, either. He felt that he had done his civic duty, and tossed the wooden stick he had randomly grabbed into a stall, then started to walk out.He had just taken a step when a hand caught his pant leg and the girl said weakly, \u201c\u2026Don\u2019t tell anyone, I beg of you.\u201d\u201cYeah, that\u2019s her,\u201d Shen Jie said. \u201cTerribly timid, and would rather be bullied than make a sound.\u201dShen Jie added, \u201cSo you beat up Goody-two-shoes Yang until he ran?\u201dHe Zhao didn\u2019t quite understand, either. \u201cThen why does this dude only pester me? Envious of my good looks?\u201dXie Yu said calmly, \u201c\u2026I was wearing a mask.\u201dAlthough the smell in the toilet wasn\u2019t that strong, the scent of disinfectant was terrible. Xie Yu had grabbed a mask before he went, not expecting he would really use it.He Zhao let out a thoughtful, \u201cAh.\u201dShen Jie immediately exposed He Zhao\u2019s unrealistic thoughts: \u201cForget it, Zhao-ge. It\u2019s no use even if you wear a mask. Big bro Xie only beat him up, but just think about what you\u2019ve done.\u201d\u201cWhat did I do? I didn\u2019t hit him,\u201d He Zhao said. \u201cI was very merciful.\u201dIf pulling someone\u2019s pants off, standing to the side and mocking their dick for being small, and letting them run around naked for almost two to three hours counted as merciful, Yang Wenyuan would probably rather get beaten up.After hearing the ins and outs of it all, Xie Yu sank into silence, too.He Zhao said, \u201cI really don\u2019t like fighting. I pick a peaceful way of settling things.\u201dPeaceful\u2026 it really was peaceful.No wonder Yang Wenyuan couldn\u2019t let it go. That event definitely ranked among the most humiliating things in life, especially for a proud elite student like him. How could he endure this? When Liu Yuan transferred schools, he had thought this piece of blackmail would now have no opposing witness, and took the chance to make trouble.But He Zhao, because of a girl\u2019s plea and her reputation, had stood there enduring everything without a word even though Yang Wenyuan had barked right up to his front door. It made Xie Yu look at his deskmate in a different light.\u201cIf not, would I have let him live till now?\u201d He Zhao picked up a pebble and threw it as he spoke. It landed on an exercise machine, then rolled a couple times. After it had gone, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s been really damn awful holding it in.\u201dThe latter half of Shen Jie\u2019s class period had been changed to a boys\u2019 assembly: the boys would go to the soccer field, line up, and practice passing. So they only chatted for a while before Shen Jie had to stand up and dust himself off: \u201cClass assembly, I have to go. Let\u2019s talk later. Calm down, Zhao-ge. You absolutely have to stay calm.\u201dHe Zhao waved at him without looking up. \u201cGet lost, you.\u201dThe temperature outside was 32\u00b0C (90\u00b0F), and Xie Yu didn\u2019t really want to stay here under the hot sun.Just as he was about to leave, He Zhao suddenly pulled him down to lie down together on the grass. The afternoon sun was so bright Xie Yu couldn\u2019t open his eyes. He narrowed them, wondering if he had been too good-tempered in the last couple days, leading his deskmate to misunderstand him. But then he heard He Zhao\u2019s careless words: \u201cAnyone can be a teacher, huh.\u201dA few clouds leisurely drifted past.He Zhao reflexively reached for his pocket but only came up with a lollipop. It was hot and the sweet had melted a little, soft to the touch.An unspeakable feeling rose within him. Several voices echoed by his ear, from Xu Xia\u2019s bullshit to Goody-two-shoes Yang\u2019s, \u201cYour grades suck.\u201dHe Zhao turned and asked Xie Yu, \u201cDo you have a cigarette?\u201dXie Yu: \u201cNo.\u201dWith difficulty, He Zhao unwrapped the lollipop.Xie Yu smelled it. Damn strawberries again.The two lay on the grass for a while not speaking. Just as He Zhao crunched up his lollipop, Xie Yu suddenly sat up and kicked him. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dHe Zhao asked: \u201cGo where?\u201dXie Yu said: \u201cIf this teacher won\u2019t do anything then let\u2019s find another one.\u201dThe weather was too hot. As Xie Yu spoke, he grabbed his collar and fanned himself.He Zhao was flashed a large expanse of skin and the deep dip of Xie Yu\u2019s collarbone. Xie Yu had a good figure: although he wasn\u2019t especially tall, he had everything he ought to, and when he lifted his shirt, he wasn\u2019t a skinny pork rib. A boy of this age hadn\u2019t fully grown into himself, but he was youthful, beautiful and adamant, with sharp teeth and claws.He Zhao was a little dazed.He wasn\u2019t sure if it was because of Xie Yu\u2019s bafflingly audacious words, or Xie Yu himself in front of him.He Zhao and Xie Yu jumped the chain-link fence surrounding the dorms, bypassed the lobby, and went in through the side door.Since a lot of students lived in school, the school had special rules for students going in and out of the dorms. If they went back to the dorms during class time, whether to get something or because they weren\u2019t feeling well and needed rest, they had to show a signed slip from the teacher and sign in at the lobby.The chain-link fence wasn\u2019t hard to climb, but no one dared to. The Dean of Students was nicknamed \u2018Mad Dog\u2019 and his office window directly overlooked the dorms. If one were unlucky enough to be seen by him, they\u2019d be fortunate to get out alive.\u201cToilet, stall, phone.\u201d Xie Yu jumped in, hand supporting his weight on the ground. He didn\u2019t even turn back as he said those key phrases, then continued, \u201cThink about it.\u201dHe Zhao thought about it. \u201cWhat are we doing? Making sentences from vocabulary like in elementary school?\u201dXie Yu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThey were accustomed to doing this and jumped the fence with accuracy, grace, and speed, like they had professional training.From the soccer field, Shen Jie saw the two silhouettes jump the fence from afar. He thought they seemed familiar, but before he could be sure, the two silhouettes had already disappeared.\u201cThat\u2019s strange.\u201d Shen Jie rubbed the back of his head. \u201c\u2026Why does that guy look so much like Zhao-ge?\u201d\u201cYou live in the dorms, too?\u201d He Zhao followed up the stairs and discovered that they were drawing closer and closer to his dorm room when Xie Yu stopped at the door directly opposite his.Xie Yu reached for the spare key on top of the door: \u201c\u2018Too?\u2019 Where do you live?\u201d\u201cLook across the corridor.\u201d He Zhao pointed. \u201cRight across from you.\u201d\u2026\u2026Xie Yu internally said, So you\u2019re the idiot who put, \u2018Preparing for the gaokao, do not disturb,\u2019 up on your door?He Zhao introduced the piece of paper on his door: \u201cTeachers usually don\u2019t come in to check my room, worried they\u2019ll disturb me studying. It\u2019s very effective. If you get a chance, try it out.\u201d\u201cNo, thank you.\u201dXie Yu went in, pulled out the box from under his bed, and started looking for something.Inside were mostly miscellaneous goods: torches, backup batteries, bandages\u2026He Zhao sat on the chair and looked at him. \u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201dXie Yu ignored him.He Zhao was bored and looked around the room, which was relatively clean. On the desk was a computer; He Zhao\u2019s gaze swept past it and landed on the Rubik\u2019s cube beside the pen holder.By the time Xie Yu found his old phone, He Zhao had already solved the Rubik\u2019s cube. Every face was a single color, neat and tidy.\u201cDon\u2019t know if it\u2019s still here.\u201d Xie Yu pressed the keypad. \u201cI made a recording.\u201dHe Zhao\u2019s hand suddenly stilled on the Rubik\u2019s cube. He wondered if he had heard wrongly.Xie Yu repeated: \u201cThat day in the toilet I made a recording. That Yang-whatever\u2014everything he said is in there. I almost forgot.\u201dThis way of thinking was a little precocious for a high school student. They were still at a reckless age, and in an urgent situation they often raised their fists and rushed forward. What high school student had these endlessly circling, twisting trains of thought?When Yang Wenyuan had dragged Liu Yuan into the toilet, Xie Yu\u2019s first reaction was to pull up the voice recorder.After the fact, he had intended to ask Liu Yuan if she needed evidence to expose him, but Liu Yuan\u2019s reaction of \u2018just let things lie\u2019 had been too strong. If she had intended to fight back, things wouldn\u2019t be this way now.She was worried people would find out, even though she was the real victim.\u201cWithdrawing from school\u2026 Damn it, the school acts that quickly?\u201dSeveral days later, a new notice went up on the school noticeboard. A large crowd of people surrounded it. Liu Cunhao, who had arrived late, stood with his friends at the very edge of the circle, tiptoeing and squinting to see. \u201cE-expulsion as punishment\u2026\u201dWhen Liu Cunhao read the next line he was completely stunned. \u201cFuck me. Yang Wenyuan?\u201d\u201cYang Wenyuan got expelled? What about He Zhao?\u201d A boy standing beside Liu Cunhao was shocked, too. \u201cWhat on earth is going on?\u201dTimes changed faster than anyone could imagine. Not only the students, even Xu Xia was totally stunned.She had taught Yang Wenyuan for a year. His studies were top-notch and he had great chances of getting into a first-tier university.Now she remembered the guarantees for Yang Wenyuan she had made to the school, and her mind went blank. The world spun around her and she finally came up with two words: I\u2019m finished.The recording He Zhao handed to the school had been altered to remove Liu Yuan\u2019s voice, but all the despicable things Yang Wenyuan had said were still in there, word for word. Yang Wenyuan demonstrated the art of \u2018changing faces\u2019 on the spot, followed shortly by his whole family. They completely dropped their self-righteous attitudes of the previous few days, and even grabbed He Zhao by the hand to plead for their son: \u201cI know you\u2019re a good kid\u2026\u201dHe Zhao almost laughed. \u201cAh, are you on a radio show? Now that you need my help, I\u2019m a good kid?\u201dThe school official asked who the girl was, and He Zhao responded, \u201cCan you guarantee the victim\u2019s privacy won\u2019t be violated?\u201dOnly the upper levels of the school knew the entire facts, and the information was kept strictly under wraps.But Goody-two-shoes Yang\u2019s crimes were set in stone.On the day of the expulsion, Shen Jie was so happy he treated his whole class to soft drinks. When he came to find He Zhao he found the class rep of Class 3 apologizing to his Zhao-ge.Aside from the class rep, all of class 2.3 was hiding behind the windows and watching.It was a magnificent scene.Liu Cunhao\u2019s face had gone red: \u201cSorry, Classmate He Zhao. I didn\u2019t have my facts right\u2026\u201dHe Zhao gravely patted Liu Cunhao\u2019s shoulders, then followed up smoothly: \u201cIt\u2019s all right, it\u2019s all right. Life is always full of surprises. I\u2019m not only handsome, but also very magnanimous.\u201dLiu Cunhao: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dShen Jie: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d He couldn\u2019t look.Xie Yu couldn\u2019t keep listening, either. He held his phone with one hand, and with the other he fumbled at his side and found a pencil case. He tossed it right out of the window and it landed on He Zhao. \u201cShut up.\u201dThe so-called \u2018school tyrants\u2019 had been somewhat demonized. Their stories had mostly been rumors which spread from person to person, half falsehoods and half truths. No one knew what the real truth was, in the end.But now, the students of Class 2.3 realized for the first time that these two school tyrants were a little different from how the legends made them out to be.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

All of you get over here and stand properly.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t stare at the damn floor. Do you think it\u2019s going to grow flowers? Don\u2019t be shy. No need to be shy. You\u2019ve already thrown away all your dignity anyway.\u201d\u201cBack straight! Heads up! Look forward. Look into my eyes.\u201dA dozen or so people stood proudly by the bronze statue in the entryway of Liyang Erzhong. They stood in two rows, their heads hanging and the backpacks they carried drooping heavily.Those not fully awake had been yelled at so loudly their sleeping bugs\u00b9 had all flown away. They flinched on the spot, trembling.One of the male students couldn\u2019t stop himself. He looked up and glanced at the Dean of Students, then lowered his head again and whispered, \u201c\u2026Mad Dog.\u201d\u2018Mad Dog\u2019 Dean Jiang\u2019s ears faintly caught something. He pointed to the students and raised his voice. \u201cWho\u2019s talking!\u201dThe man\u2019s chest heaved wildly. On his nose was perched a pair of gold-framed spectacles, but it didn\u2019t give him any air of scholarly elegance. In his hand he held a name chart which recorded the names of tardy students. Those who were late more than three times would be recorded on the last page of the chart\u2014the blacklist.The nickname \u2018Mad Dog\u2019 had been around a long time, coined by students a few years back and passed down. Everyone said that you must never provoke this Dean Jiang. The legendary Mad Dog was more terrifying than even a tigress.Dean Jiang\u2019s eyes narrowed. He walked from the head of the line to the end with a sneer on his face. \u201c\u2014Late. Not even a few days into the new term and you\u2019re already playing the late game.\u201dHe walked down the line again, then suddenly stopped. The other students held their breaths and Dean Jiang\u2019s voice rose again. \u201cHe Zhao? What\u2019s the situation?!\u201dHe Zhao stepped forward: \u201cI was late.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re living in the dorms this semester and I still catch you at the school gates.\u201d Dean Jiang indicated for the other students to go back to class, keeping just He Zhao. \u201cAll right. Your ability to break the school rules is really something else.\u201dHe Zhao said that he had gone for a morning run and forgotten the time.Dean Jiang looked at He Zhao, who was impossibly neat and clean. He would even be able to smell the detergent from his clothes if he were to get closer.Morning run, my ass. More like an old man stroll.Dean Jiang didn\u2019t bother quibbling further. He looked at the time: it was ten minutes past the start of class. He said: \u201cThe usual.\u201d\u201cReflection essay, I know.\u201d He Zhao walked forward as he said, \u201cI\u2019ll deliver it to your office by lunch. See you, Dean Jiang.\u201dSeeing He Zhao about to disappear, Dean Jiang said, \u201cWait, come back.\u201dHe Zhao stopped.Dean Jiang: \u201cWhat\u2019s up with that petition from your class?\u201dAfter the series of dramatic events, Xu Xia didn\u2019t receive any punishment, but her transfer to the Experimental High School was a lost cause. Her superior saw that she sincerely admitted her mistake and he didn\u2019t pursue the matter further on account of her having taught for more than a decade.What made the school officer\u2019s head hurt was that the students of class 3 wanted to change their form teacher.When He Zhao mentioned this, he had initially thought no one in class would agree. Class 3 was usually very silent and the students usually kept quiet, but now everyone\u2019s dislike for Xu Xia suddenly burst forth.Liu Cunhao took the lead in gathering his buddies in support.\u201cDepose her!\u201d The speaker was an energetic boy. His eyes seemed to sparkle as he looked around. \u201cAs long as our whole class participates, even if we fail, a group crime is always more lightly punished.\u201dLiu Cunhao slapped the boy\u2019s head. \u201cKnow-It-All, why are you so pessimistic? Before we even do anything you\u2019re already thinking of failure.\u201dThe boy called \u2018Know-It-All\u2019 said: \u201cThis isn\u2019t pessimism. This is a strategy. I can mention ten events like this off the top of my head. Last year, Class 5 protested the teacher taking their gym period\u2026\u201dHe Zhao had intended to enthusiastically encourage Xie Yu to look for Mad Dog with them.Xie Yu pointed to the petition in Liu Cunhao\u2019s hand, which half the class had already signed. \u201cI\u2019m already giving you a lot of face by signing, all right?\u201dAfter stopping He Zhao, Dean Jiang didn\u2019t say much to him before leaving.He Zhao ran all the way back to the classroom. While the English teacher wasn\u2019t looking, he bent down and slipped in through the back door, then quietly sat down. From the lightweight schoolbag on his shoulders he pulled out a cup of warm soymilk and handed it to Xie Yu. \u201cHere.\u201dXie Yu looked at the soymilk and the straw. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d\u201cDrink it,\u201d He Zhao said, hanging his bag on the back of his chair. \u201cDidn\u2019t you want it unsweetened?\u201dAfter finding out that he lived opposite Xie Yu, He Zhao often went to knock on Xie Yu\u2019s door, whether anything was the matter or not. Of course, Xie Yu didn\u2019t welcome this at all. Sometimes He Zhao got up early and went over to call Xie Yu up, too. \u201cCome, let\u2019s go get breakfast.\u201dThen He Zhao discovered that Xie Yu was very picky about his food and would rather not eat than eat something he didn\u2019t like.\u201cIt\u2019s soy milk either way. What\u2019s the difference?\u201d He Zhao asked.Xie Yu: \u201cI don\u2019t drink sweet soymilk.\u201dThe school cafeteria didn\u2019t have that many varieties of soy milk, and only the breakfast place outside school had unsweetened soy milk. He Zhao had wanted to treat Xie Yu to a meal to thank him for helping him out so much, but he hadn\u2019t expected to become an errand boy in the end.\u201cWhat are we doing? Going over questions? What is this?\u201d He Zhao spent a long time just looking for his English book, and after he opened it he was more confused. \u201c\u2026When was this assigned?\u201dXie Yu had borrowed the work from the people in the row in front to copy and didn\u2019t even raise his head. \u201cDon\u2019t know. Probably when you were deciding between the lace skirt and the leather pants.\u201dHe Zhao\u2019s movements hadn\u2019t escaped the teacher\u2019s eyes.The English teacher wrote the question on the board, then put down the chalk and called He Zhao\u2019s name. \u201cStudent who was late, come and explain. When you encounter a question like this, what\u2019s the first step?\u201dHe Zhao stood up slowly, hesitated for a while, then said, \u201cGive up and go to the next question.\u201dXie Yu was halfway through copying a translation. On hearing this answer, he forgot to lift his pencil and gave the letter \u2018C\u2019 he was writing a long tail. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe English teacher: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe whole class: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe Zhao continued: \u201cWhen you meet a question you can\u2019t answer, don\u2019t waste your time.\u201dAfter a long silence, someone couldn\u2019t restrain a snort of laughter any more. Then the whole class started laughing uproariously.\u201cHa ha ha ha ha ha next question.\u201d\u201cGenius, genius.\u201dThe English teacher tried to frown very seriously but in the end cracked up, too. \u201cYou sit down and listen properly.\u201dAfter morning self-study passed, the news that Xu Xia had been transferred to the first year students spread throughout the class.\u201cA teacher for a first year class has a bad voice and needs an operation, so Xu Xia probably went to that class. Our new form teacher is surnamed Tang.\u201dKnow-It-All had listened at the door of the faculty office and brought the news fresh out of the oven back to class. He said as he ran, \u201dAnd he was transferred from an elite school. Special teacher, sounds very awesome.\u201dWan Da, who was coincidentally surnamed \u2018Wan,\u2019 always had a lot of underground gossip to spread, and no one knew where he obtained it from. In addition, no one ever knew if the confusing and vague gossip he brought was true or false. Wan Da bragged that, even in the half of the city outside Liyang Erzhong, there wasn\u2019t anything he didn\u2019t know. So he was nicknamed \u2018Know-It-All.\u2019\u00b2Liu Cunhao was currently collecting homework and said, \u201cYou even dare to listen at Mad Dog\u2019s door?\u201dWan Da said: \u201cHave to. In order to get firsthand news, risking death is a must.\u201dKnow-It-All\u2019s news was never accurate, not even one time out of ten, but this time he had hit the nail on the head. The new form teacher was surnamed Tang and even his name was full of character: Tang Sen.Tang Sen looked like an ordinary man entering middle age. A set of Buddhist beads was wrapped around his wrist, and he taught class attentively. Within two days he had memorized everyone\u2019s name and face.He also spoke well and didn\u2019t put on airs, but he was a little annoying and long-winded. In a single monologue he could touch on several totally unrelated topics, but when he strung them together, the change didn\u2019t seem abrupt at all.\u201cStudent on duty, clean the classroom before you leave. It\u2019s important to sleep early and get enough sleep. Don\u2019t eat food that is too oily. If you encounter a question you don\u2019t know, just leave it. You can ask, but you definitely can\u2019t copy. When you get home, remember to ask after your parents. They\u2019re exhausted from their day, too. Right, it might rain tomorrow, so you\u2019d best bring an umbrella\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter the last class let out for the day, the live-in students stayed behind to continue evening self-study.Coincidentally, both He Zhao and Xie Yu often skipped evening self-study. Either one of them would skip or they would both skip, which was why even half a month after starting school they hadn\u2019t realized the other also lived in school.More than half the class had left. The ten or so people who remained did their homework and started chatting idly.Outside, night had already fallen.Wan Da asked mysteriously, \u201cDo you know about the ghost in our dormitory?\u201dWhile Know-It-All had started talking about this supernatural topic, He Zhao had dragged Xie Yu into a team game and was currently focused on executing his own skill sets. \u201cI\u2019m really very strong\u2014did you see? Two birds with one stone. Come over. I\u2019ll cover you.\u201dXie Yu: \u201cLook carefully. I was the one who killed that person.\u201dIt was impossible to attack a teammate, or Xie Yu might have killed He Zhao first.\u201cThese past few nights, there\u2019ve been weird noises on our floor. Especially after midnight. There\u2019s knocking at the door.\u201d As Wan Da spoke, he got quieter and quieter. \u201cI heard that a few days ago it was still roaming the first floor\u2026 but starting from last night, strange things happened on the second floor, too. I heard the knocking with my own ears, but when I went to open the door, there was nothing at all outside. At the end of the corridor, I saw a shadow go by.\u201dWan Da continued: \u201cI don\u2019t know, maybe I saw wrongly. But wasn\u2019t there always a rumor? You know, right? That person who jumped?\u201dOther students corroborated: \u201cI know, I know. Jumped from the roof.\u201d\u201cI live on the first floor and I\u2019ve heard it many times. Every time there\u2019s knocking, I don\u2019t dare to open the door. But yesterday it stopped. Did it really go upstairs?\u201dXie Yu was focused on his game and wasn\u2019t listening. He encountered two major bosses and was about to fight them when he turned and found that his teammate had vanished at some point. \u201cTsk. Weren\u2019t you supposed to cover me?\u201dHe Zhao\u2019s expression wasn\u2019t quite right. \u201c\u2026Which floor are we on? The third?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Rumor had it there had been no report because the school had suppressed this event in order to preserve its reputation.The reason behind the suicide was also subject to a lot of discussion. Academic pressure, bad romantic luck, family bankruptcy, school bullying\u2026\u2026\u2026The more Wan Da and the others talked about it, the more excited they got. They talked about the dormitory building as if it were a haunted house. To create atmosphere, he also turned off the lights with a snap.At eight at night, it was pitch black outside and you couldn\u2019t see your hand in front of your face. Only the lights and the stars in the sky were visible. A tall building near the school was currently hosting an anniversary celebration, and it was lit up with red lights. Now that the lights in the classroom were off, the sea of red that shone over from the other side looked especially strange.A girl screamed out loud: \u201cWan Da, what are you doing?!\u201d\u201cAre you sick?!\u201d\u201cTurn on the lights, quick, turn on the lights!\u201dWan Da remained unmoved and persistent. \u201cAtmosphere is important when telling stories. Atmosphere.\u201dThe instant the lights went out, He Zhao grabbed Xie Yu\u2019s wrist and cursed softly. \u201cFuck.\u201dThe phone game had ended and Xie Yu\u2019s phone screen was dark. He turned but didn\u2019t shake off He Zhao\u2019s hand. Instead, he asked with some interest, \u201cYou\u2019re scared of ghosts?\u201dWan Da wasn\u2019t aware of what was happening in the corner of the last row. He prepared to start the story of a scary hair salon and called the two big brothers over to listen: \u201cZhao-ge, Yu-ge, join us? It\u2019s absolutely terrifying and very exciting. If you dare to sleep alone after hearing this, I\u2019ll give you fifty cents.\u201dHe Zhao hadn\u2019t even had the opportunity to refuse when he heard a reply from his especially antisocial, loner-to-a-fault deskmate who never liked to join the crowds. \u201cSure.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThere were just twelve people in the classroom.Eight guys and four girls.Wan Da sat in the middle and the remaining people forming a circle around him. The girls formed a tight group, and those who didn\u2019t have a place found chairs to pull over, looking for a spot.Xie Yu sat at the very outer edge, near the corner. He Zhao was next to him.Xie Yu glanced down; He Zhao\u2019s hand was still holding his: \u201cSo you don\u2019t intend to let go?\u201dThe supernatural story of the horrifying hair salon started. Wan Da deliberately spoke in a tragic tone: \u201cXiao Jie was a very pretty girl, with a head of long, shining jet-black hair. Everyone who saw her had a deep impression of her beautiful hair\u2026\u201dXie Yu frowned. He Zhao\u2019s five fingers, wrapped painfully around his wrist, also left a deep impression.Wan Da\u2019s storytelling ability was pretty ordinary, but he was very earnest and never dropped the act. Besides, the atmosphere was very good. So, in the middle of the story, the four girls screamed in unison.The girls\u2019 screams were much more terrifying than the contents of the story.To an attentive listener, suddenly hearing that sound would cause their heart to jump.Xie Yu thought that He Zhao should go and sit with the girls and scream with them, but He Zhao\u2019s body language radiated, \u201cThe big bro needs to save face.\u201d Though he went rigid, he didn\u2019t make a sound and pretended to be calm.\u201c\u2026The hairdresser turned around, a very strange smile surfacing on his face. The corner of his lips lifted a little, then a little more. He picked up the scissors and stood in the doorway of the storage room. His bangs, which were very long, covered one eye. That totally dead look\u2026 he didn\u2019t look like a normal person. He didn\u2019t even look like a live person.\u201dWan Da\u2019s voice got lower and lower, but his voice suddenly lilted in emphasis as the story climaxed: \u201cHe opened the door! In the storage room was a row of shelves packed full of\u2014human heads!\u201dHe Zhao\u2019s hand moved down a few inches and caught hold of Xie Yu\u2019s.Xie Yu shook his hand a few times but couldn\u2019t shake the other\u2019s hand off.\u201cAttached to the scalps, jet-black hair hung down on either side of their faces. Their agonized expressions showed how much they suffered in the moment they died. Terrifying, scared, and twisted.\u201d\u201cLet go,\u201d Xie Yu said. \u201cAre you going to let go?\u201dHe Zhao: \u201cNo.\u201d\u201c\u2026You\u2019re really scared of this?\u201d\u201cWho said I\u2019m scared?\u201d\u201cThen let go.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dJust as Wan Da was painstakingly describing how terrifying those decapitated human heads were, a face appeared in the classroom window.The face was half hidden by the blinds, the other half just barely visible.The features weren\u2019t clear and only the silhouette could be seen.But it was visibly a man.After a beat, the man asked, \u201c\u2014What are you doing?\u201dWan Da had been halfway through the story when the face appeared in the window. Even he jumped from fright. \u201cDamn.\u201dThe girls screamed in unison: \u201cAah!\u201d\u201cWhat are you screaming about?\u201d Dean Jiang pushed open the door and walked in. He felt for the light switch and flicked it on. \u201cWhat are you all doing? It\u2019s evening self-study. Have you finished your homework? Ah? Having a tea party here?\u201dThis noisy lot was giving him a headache. He rapped the podium with his book. \u201cI could hear your class from across the hall. Do you not have enough homework to do? Tell me and I\u2019ll pass the message on to your teacher.\u201dWan Da said, \u201cNo, no, no, no need, Dean Jiang. We have enough homework, really, enough. If we have any more we won\u2019t be able to handle it.\u201dBefore Dean Jiang left work, he routinely made several rounds of the classrooms. Perhaps he was in a good mood from being about to get off work: he didn\u2019t pursue the matter further and only reminded everyone: \u201cBe quiet and respect the peace. If I find you doing this again\u2026\u201d\u201cYes, yes, yes, yes.\u201dWhen Dean Jiang left, the class let out a breath. They were about to pull their chairs back to their seats when a girl suddenly screamed again.\u201cOrder, order, be quiet,\u201d Wan Da said. \u201cXu Qingqing, is my story really so terrifying?\u201dXu Qingqing said that she wasn\u2019t nearly as timid as he thought she was. Then she looked pointedly in a certain direction and successfully drew everyone\u2019s eyes to the tightly linked hands of the two big bros.Wan Da and the other students: \u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dXie Yu had been held onto for a very long time and didn\u2019t notice anything wrong.He Zhao was still remembering the story details. \u201cIn the end, she managed to get out?\u201d\u201cIf she\u2019s not dead, she went mad,\u201d Xie Yu said calmly. \u201cIf not, it\u2019s not a horror story, is it?\u201dHe Zhao and Xie Yu. Aside from their titles of \u2018problem youth,\u2019 their appearances were also rather eye-catching.In their first year, when the school forum was picking a school beau, these two were at the top of the list. Most of the students didn\u2019t quite have the nerve to interact with them, but perhaps because all things looked better from a distance, students from other schools constantly posted, \u201cCan I get the contact details of XX from your school? They\u2019re s cool (*/\u03c9\uff3c*)\u201dThere were many rumors, but the romantic histories of these two were a mystery.Since being put in Class 3, many girls whom Wan Da had connections to, or didn\u2019t have connections to, all swarmed to him. He thought about it: now he could finally give them an answer: Forget it. Our class will probably take care of them on its own.At eight-thirty, evening self-study period ended.Wan Da packed up his things and left with the rest of the class. After these few days, he felt that the class was as close knit as a family. Following the incident with changing teachers, they were war comrades.\u201cTelling you first.\u201d Wan Da walked ahead. \u201cDuring the monthly exams next week, I heard from Mr. Tang\u2019s office that the teachers of every year are writing their own questions. They\u2019ll look at Sizhong for the base difficulty. At any rate, it\u2019ll be more difficult than the ones we usually do.\u201dXie Yu: \u201cYou\u2019re telling me this information?\u201dHe Zhao found it inexplicable, too. All year round, he and Xie Yu placed last and second-to-last in the school. Exams, to them, were nothing at all. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of this information?\u201dWan Da said, \u201cI\u2019m reminding you to prepare your cheating early. This time, the consequences for getting caught cheating are very serious. I heard there will be three teachers overseeing every exam hall.\u201dIn the school district, only the streetlights were on, accompanied by the soft cry of insects. The beautiful summer was about to end, and the wind that rushed up towards their faces held a hint of a chill.He Zhao: \u201cAh.\u201dXie Yu: \u201cReally, thank you.\u201dXie Yu went back, washed up, and flipped open \u201cMock Exams: Monthly Papers.\u201d It was a collection of the monthly exams from all the high schools in A City. He found Sizhong\u2019s questions from last year and looked at them.He glossed over the simple questions, and when he encountered an interesting or difficult one he stopped to do it.Time passed quickly and it was soon time for lights-out. Xie Yu felt that this portable light could probably last another hour. He kept doing questions when suddenly his phone screen lit up.A QQ message.He Zhao: Asleep?Xie Yu: ?He Zhao: Lonely night. Chat with me.Xie Yu: No time, not chatting, get lost.He Zhao had already gotten used to his deskmate\u2019s aloof way of speaking. He seemed not to notice that the quality of this conversation was terrible and replied: What are you doing?Xie Yu looked at the thick stack of math papers and the functions question he had solved halfway. He wrote back, blank-faced: Gaming.He Zhao: What game is it?These four words held a strong undercurrent of, \u2018Let me join in and we can play together.\u2019 Xie Yu remained deathly calm and resolved to kill the conversation stone cold dead in the water: Single-player game.He Zhao: \u2026\u2026Xie Yu put down his phone and suddenly remembered He Zhao\u2019s words and actions during evening self-study. He replied again: So scared you can\u2019t sleep?This time, He Zhao didn\u2019t keep looking for conversation where there was none.He Zhao: [/Smile]He Zhao: Ha ha, funny joke. What have I ever been scared of?He Zhao: [/Wave]Xie Yu hadn\u2019t taken Know-It-All\u2019s supernatural dorm story seriously at all. He treated it only as a story. Just like the story of the scary hair salon, Xie Yu had just listened to it for entertainment.He had lived at school in first year, too, and nothing had happened the entire year.Strange knocking at the door. What rich imagination.When Xie Yu lay down, it was close to midnight. He lay on the bed flicking through his messages. He saw Zhou Dalei\u2019s photo of Aunt Mei pinning a shady-looking young man on the floor with the caption: Catching a thief bare-handed. Badass, badass.In the chat, Aunt Mei was judging Dalei\u2019s photography skills.Lei\u2019s mom fiercely protected her son: It\u2019s about the person, not about the skill! Look at how good my son\u2019s photo is!Xie Yu looked at it for a long time. In the end, he didn\u2019t respond with anything, only gave it a like. He had just put down his phone when he heard a sound in the originally quiet corridor.\u2014It seemed to be very, very slow footsteps.The sound drew closer.Then stopped in front of a door.Xie Yu clearly heard two knocks on the door.Thunk.Thunk.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He fumbled for a while but only found a puddle of saliva by his mouth. He sat up in a bad mood, his head fuzzy. \u201c\u2026It\u2019s the middle of the night. Who is it?\u201dHe had been rudely awakened from a sound sleep; anyone would be a little frustrated. But when Shen Jie saw the words \u201cZhao-ge\u201d on his phone, his mood immediately changed.\u201cZhao-ge, what are your instructions?\u201d Shen Jie turned on the light and sat up. \u201cIn this quiet night, do you want thirteen spices crayfish or Yang Yuan Road\u2019s famous fried buns? Or a chat service?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dShen Jie had prepared to go through fire and fury, but his Zhao-ge only said, \u201cI have a question for you.\u201d\u201cAsk! Ask away!\u201d\u201cDo you think, Xie Yu\u2026 that is, the Xie Yu you know.\u201d He Zhao wasn\u2019t quite sure how to say it. He scratched his head and hesitated, then asked something that left Shen Jie unable to sleep for the entire night. \u201cDo you think he\u2019ll let me hug him while I sleep?\u201dShen Jie felt a shock go through his entire body. \u201cHah?\u201dShen Jie had not visited Class 3 very much recently. Had he missed something important?How had things developed in such a strange direction?Was he dreaming? Maybe he wasn\u2019t awake yet?\u201cZhao-ge, I think that whether it\u2019s the Xie Yu I know or the Xie Yu you know\u2026 he won\u2019t agree.\u201d Shen Jie stammered. \u201cI can\u2019t even imagine the number of ways you\u2019ll die.\u201dHe Zhao: \u201cIs it really that definite?\u201dShen Jie: \u201cDefinitely. More definite than definitely.\u201dAs Shen Jie finished, he felt Zhao-ge hang up with disappointment. It wasn\u2019t an ordinary sort of disappointment; it also contained many mysterious emotions that Shen Jie couldn\u2019t quite comprehend.The next day, He Zhao didn\u2019t knock on Xie Yu\u2019s door to ask him to breakfast.Before Xie Yu left, he glanced at the room across the hall. The door was closed tightly and there was no movement. After a moment\u2019s hesitation, he didn\u2019t knock and went straight to class.\u201cSpeaking of which, our school dormitory building is really strange.\u201d The moment he walked into class, he heard Wan Da spreading ridiculous news again. \u201cDidn\u2019t I say I heard knocking on the second floor a few days ago? Last night, it disappeared. It\u2019s really strange. A lot of people heard it, and it\u2019s definitely not a hallucination.\u201dLiu Cunhao didn\u2019t live at school and wasn\u2019t moved by this talk of strangeness. \u201cDon\u2019t stand around scaring yourselves. It\u2019s nothing of the sort. Believe in science, all right? Say it with me. Believe in science.\u201dXu Qingqing said, \u201cKnow-It-All, saying it once or twice is enough. You don\u2019t have to keep repeating it. Why doesn\u2019t anything of the sort ever happen in the girls\u2019 dorm? If it really came to knock on my door, I\u2019d just open the door and hit its head so hard it cracks.\u201dA boy slowly raised his hand: \u201cI\u2026 I heard it too. It\u2019s real. Last night, on the third floor, there was knocking.\u201dHe Zhao hadn\u2019t arrived, but Shen Jie ran very fast towards Class 3.Shen Jie sat down in He Zhao\u2019s seat. \u201cWhere\u2019s Zhao-ge? Not here yet?\u201dXie Yu looked at him and let him savor it.Shen Jie had savored the look: Xie Yu was calling him rubbish. But he was genuinely curious whether He Zhao had executed his strange and dangerous thought or not. \u201cLast night, how did you sleep?\u201dThe news of knocking on the third floor spread like wildfire. Xie Yu straight up assumed Shen Jie was one of the nosy ones and retorted, \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\u201cI think\u2026 maybe you might have suffered some\u2026 mm\u2026 disturbance?\u201dHalf the morning classes had already passed when He Zhao arrived.\u201cZhao-ge, Mr. Tang said to come to his office at noon.\u201d Liu Cunhao had just returned from the faculty office and saw He Zhao leisurely walking into class. He paused. \u201c\u2014Those eyebags of yours are quite heavy.\u201dHe Zhao had gotten up in a hurry and hadn\u2019t tidied himself too well. He was currently looking down, stuffing the red string of his necklace into his collar. \u201cGot it.\u201dTang Sen had received a subject teacher\u2019s report that morning, saying his class always had absentees. Did they think this was their own home, coming to class when they wanted to and not coming when they didn\u2019t? Tang Sen had good-naturedly apologized for today\u2019s absentee in order to soothe the fires of the subject teacher\u2019s rage. \u201cYes, I\u2019ll definitely talk to him properly. This is too unbecoming.\u201dWhen the absentee arrived, Tang Sen had already prepared a long lecture. He was going to have a good chat with the student.\u201cHe Zhao, please sit.\u201dThis was the first time He Zhao encountered a teacher who invited him to sit down. In half-disbelief he sat down. Tang Sen said, \u201c\u2026Because the contents of our chat might be a little long.\u201dHalf an hour later, He Zhao understood just how much longer \u2018might be a little long\u2019 meant.\u201cI know that young people like you have your own way of thinking, and it\u2019s normal not to like learning.\u201d Tang Sen stopped to take a drink of water and continued. \u201cI fully understand, but even if you\u2019re not interested in a subject, running away isn\u2019t a good solution. A man must have fighting spirit, bravely accept challenges, and scale to the peak with courage.\u201dHe Zhao cut him off: \u201c\u2026How much longer are you going to talk?\u201dTang Sen glanced at the outline of his speech and told the truth. \u201cI\u2019ve covered three parts out of five. There are still some big pieces of content to come.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dIn the end, Tang Sen stopped when the class bell rang. \u201cLet\u2019s stop here for today.\u201dBefore he had finished, He Zhao was already standing up and preparing to leave. Then Tang Sen\u2019s words took a sharp turn as he continued, \u201cThose dark circles of yours\u2026\u201dHe Zhao had one hand on the door. For the first time, he felt that being called into the office by a teacher really was annoying. \u201cWe youngsters have rich night lives.\u201dWhen He Zhao returned, he lay on the desk, put his head down, and slept.He hadn\u2019t done up his top button and his collar lay open, the red string at his neck hanging out. Xie Yu accidentally caught a glimpse and thought it really ruined He Zhao\u2019s image.A few girls were standing in the corridor, pointing their way and whispering behind their hands with excited expressions.Since school started, this group of girls had stuck together. Each had a water bottle and they would come over after class to get hot water, then stand in the corridor holding their water doing god knows what. Someone in class started a betting pool that they had come to see someone, and Wan Da had put fifty bucks in. Later, he grew too anxious and came to find He Zhao, hoping to get him to help check.At that time, He Zhao had said, \u201cOf course they\u2019re here to see me,\u201d but when he walked to the window and leaned against the windowsill, the group of girls ran away with their faces buried in their hands before he even said anything.Wan Da jumped up and yelled, \u201cI won! Yeah!\u201dHe Zhao hadn\u2019t understood. \u201cWhat did you win? Who on earth did they come to see? Running away without saying anything\u2026 is very rude.\u201dWan Da recovered from his joy and noticed that something wasn\u2019t right. \u201cZhao-ge, you\u2026 your comprehension ability when it comes to girls\u2019 hearts\u2026\u201d\u201cHey.\u201dXie Yu called.He Zhao didn\u2019t react.Xie Yu leaned back, picked up his English book and rolled it up, then hit He Zhao on the head.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d He Zhao opened one eye. \u201cWhat?\u201dXie Yu pointed at his chest. \u201cWear your clothes properly.\u201dHe Zhao hadn\u2019t reacted: \u201cAh?\u201dXie Yu said: \u201cBurns my eyes.\u201dHe Zhao said, \u201cYou\u2019re blind, right? My figure\u2019s especially good,\u201d as he did up his buttons.Xie Yu said, \u201cYou didn\u2019t sleep last night?\u201dHe Zhao lifted his head: \u201cSo we haven\u2019t been deskmates for so long for nothing, after all. Are you concerned about me?\u201d\u201cYeah,\u201d Xie Yu mocked without holding back. \u201cConcerned about whether you were so scared by last night\u2019s knocking you couldn\u2019t fall asleep.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dTo be honest, He Zhao had almost been scared to death.He really wasn\u2019t scared of much, but ghosts were the exception.His mom had read him horror stories like they were Grimm\u2019s fairy tales. As a result, rather than developing an immunity to it, the shadow of his childhood lingered incredibly deeply. Fear was almost a reflex at this point.But he wanted to save face.\u201cNot possible.\u201dHe Zhao repeated again: \u201cNot possible.\u201d\u201cWhat are you chatting about?\u201d Wan Da walked over, picked a nearby empty seat, and sat down. \u201cTo be honest, there\u2019s something I want your help with.\u201dLiu Cunhao also ambled over and said, \u201cCan you let us see your crib notes?\u201dIn the next period, the students had to transcribe an English paragraph from memory.Their English teacher was very particular about correctness. If their writing wasn\u2019t up to standard, they had to pick a time to go to her office and do it again.Classmates had already made \u2018notes\u2019 on their desks. All of them had done something\u2014some more, some less. Wan Da and Liu Cunhao were arguing over whose notes were better: \u201cLook at mine. Definitely won\u2019t be found. But yours? That\u2019s out of date\u2026\u201dLiu Cunhao covered the notes he had written on the desk with his book; he was satisfied with what he had done. \u201cWhat do you know? I\u2019ve used this method for a long time.\u201dAs the two fought, they noticed that of the worst two students in the class, one of them was sleeping and the other was on his phone. Impossibly calm.\u201cMaybe they already made their crib notes?\u201d\u201cActually, I think it\u2019s not very safe to write on the desk. Let\u2019s ask them? Those two have more experience.\u201d\u201cTheir cribbing skills must be legendary.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dUnder the heated, hopeful gazes of both Wan Da and Liu Cunhao, He Zhao gave the perfect answer: \u201cWhy bother with that? Just open the book and copy.\u201dXie Yu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWan Da stood stunned for a while before reacting. \u201cNo crib notes beats crib notes.\u201dLiu Cunhao: \u201cBadass, badass.\u201dBut the facts proved that He Zhao wasn\u2019t as formidable as they thought he was.After opening the book, he couldn\u2019t find the vocabulary word.\u201cWhere?\u201d He Zhao flipped back and forth. \u201cWhy is it in English for a while and Chinese for a while? Is it really a vocabulary word from this chapter?\u201dXie Yu had thought that his performance of a bad student was well-forged in fire. But now he discovered that he was still very far from good. A genuine bad student was far more idiotic than even he had imagined.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She had brought the test papers from all three classes with her, and after class she came over to distribute them. She stood in the doorway and gave her instructions, then said before handing out the results, \u201cYou write from memory for your test like you do questions. If you can\u2019t remember one, then you wait for the next one, and in the end you hand in a blank sheet?\u201dXie Yu couldn\u2019t hold it in. He looked down and laughed.He Zhao put his hand on his deskmate\u2019s shoulder and leaned close. \u201cHeartless. When I asked you to let me take a peek, you didn\u2019t let me\u2026\u201dXie Yu replied: \u201cWhy go to the trouble? Just open the book and straight up copy.\u201dHe Zhao couldn\u2019t say anything.During the class\u2019s memorization assignment, Xie Yu had hesitated for a while, then figured he really couldn\u2019t do that badly. He buckled down and copied out the vocabulary, and very carefully controlled his answer accuracy rate at 60%.He Zhao had flipped through his books for a while, then caught sight of Xie Yu\u2019s paper out of the corner of his eye. He started to get ideas. \u201cYou know half of it?\u201dXie Yu\u2019s face remained blank. \u201cIs that so surprising?\u201dThe English teacher continued: \u201c\u2026The rest, Xu Qingqing, give them out. Check what you did wrong. Tonight, your homework is a mock paper covering this chapter. Do it attentively. Next week is the monthly exam. Don\u2019t score badly and embarrass the class.\u201dHe Zhao wasn\u2019t listening to the teacher. Suddenly, he heard Xie Yu say: \u201cLook to your right.\u201d\u201cLook at what?\u201d He Zhao turned, not understanding. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing\u2026\u201dHe stopped mid-sentence.It was Wan Da and Liu Cunhao.Those two were eyeing them with a fixed and very complicated gaze.He Zhao could read an 800-word mini-essay from their expressions, one that auto-scrolled past their faces. I thought you were the king of copying, but you secretly handed in a blank sheet.Their gazes were so heated they seemed to want to pierce him through.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe Zhao calmly and composedly averted his gaze, pretending to have seen nothing. He turned and asked Xie Yu, \u201cWhat shall we do for dinner?\u201dIn the evening, they could take advantage of the short period of time the school gates were open to slip out and eat a good meal.Although the students living at school weren\u2019t allowed to pass through the school gates at will, at the end of the school day, the volume of students leaving through the gate was so large that even the Mad Dog couldn\u2019t control it.The cafeteria\u2019s selection was average and the food preparation wasn\u2019t stellar, either. The chef often added too much salt and the accompanying soup was thin. In a large pot of pork rib soup there were often only several lonely pieces of wintermelon.He Zhao said, \u201cI asked Shen Jie to get us a good spot at the Gold List. Shall we go after class?\u201d\u201cGold List?\u201dHe Zhao took that as acceptance and glanced down, replying to Shen Jie: \u201cSave another seat. My deskmate is coming.\u201dXie Yu hadn\u2019t even had the time to refuse.He was rather picky with food, but he rarely left the school grounds.Within 500 metres of Erzhong were several small restaurants in fierce competition. In order to win customers\u2019 hearts they put in a lot of effort. But they didn\u2019t have price wars: they didn\u2019t have discounts or give the second item for half price. Instead, starting with the Gold List restaurant, restaurants up and down the street suddenly started changing their names.Valedictorian House, Peking U Dumplings, Tsinghua Bun Shop. Even the roadside food carts and the barbecue stalls that could be chased away by city management at any time were called 985 Barbecue.\u00b9From the school gate, it was quite the shocking sight.Gold List Restaurant was at the end of the street, the farthest from the school. Around the corner was the next street over, which was deserted.Shen Jie picked a four-person table, sat down, and perused the menu while waiting for the others.The menu consisted mostly of simple fare. Shen Jie ticked off a few items they usually ordered, then got out his phone and asked He Zhao: I\u2019m ordering. What does your young master Yu want? Anything he can\u2019t eat?He Zhao recalled the previous incident with the sweetened and unsweetened soymilk, and thought that the list of \u2018things he can\u2019t eat\u2019 would probably take Xie Yu three days and three nights to enumerate.-Coriander, onion, garlic, greasy things, sweet things. Best avoid chili too.Shen Jie looked at the text He Zhao sent back and sank into deep thought. He flipped attentively through the menu and for the first time realized the weight of the responsibility that had been placed upon him. \u201cBoss, can you hold the chili on this chili chicken? And use less oil and don\u2019t use spring onion.\u201dAs he finished, he felt that the chili chicken would lose its dignity if this continued.\u201c\u2026hold on, I\u2019ll take another look.\u201dShen Jie got a headache looking at the menu. He texted He Zhao: So troublesome? Are you making things difficult for me on purpose?He Zhao: You should be glad. This is only the part of the list I remember.The Gold List Restaurant had been in business for many years. The decor looked old and a big creaking fan hung from the ceiling.Xie Yu walked to the doorway and immediately saw the banner above the entrance. Six gold-lined words: Your name on the gold list.Inside, a table of people was halfway through their meal. They didn\u2019t look like Erzhong students. With their heads of gold hair, if they attended Erzhong, their heads might have already been plucked bare by Dean Jiang.\u201cHere.\u201d Shen Jie stood up and waved.He Zhao pushed open the door, which had a bell attached. The movement set the bell to ringing for a while.The gold-haired people at the next table over were drinking beer. Seeing other people come in, they held their drinks to their mouths and glanced sideways at the newcomers, then leisurely tipped their heads back and drank.The most eye-catching of them had a snake tattooed on his neck, twisting into his collar.\u201cSit,\u201d Shen Jie greeted them. \u201cA pitcher of beer?\u201dNow that the reputed big bros of the East and West Buildings were sitting together, they had to have a good drink. In Shen Jie\u2019s mind surfaced the following scene: they ate, drank, and reminisced about the past year of being big bros.Then he heard Xie Yu say: \u201cMineral water.\u201dHe Zhao closed the menu and also said two words: \u201cWatermelon juice.\u201dShen Jie: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dShen Jie talked a lot of nonsense. Going off his description, even He Zhao would seem cold and unapproachable. Xie Yu felt that he and Zhou Dalei should get together and co-write a novel.\u201cOur class teacher is running a tutoring service in private. Someone reported him and dragged him to the Ministry of Education.\u201dShen Jie was talking up a storm when someone walked up. He seemed to have drunk too much and he wasn\u2019t steady on his feet as he walked. He crashed into the table and right onto Shen Jie: \u201cSorry, sorry\u2026 I\u2019m a bit dizzy.\u201dThat person apologized, then stumbled towards the bathrooms in the back.He Zhao suddenly put down his chopsticks: \u201cWait.\u201dThe person stopped.He Zhao stood up and walked over to the person, his face going cold. \u201cWhat\u2019s up with you?\u201d\u201cZhao-ge, it\u2019s fine. They just knocked into me,\u201d Shen Jie cajoled. \u201c\u2026How can you get mad just from drinking watermelon juice?\u201dXie Yu looked up and saw the man with the snake tattoo put down his glass and look meaningfully at the people next to him.He Zhao said, \u201cIdiot, you make me mad. Check your pocket. Are you missing anything?\u201dShen Jie froze, and it was several seconds before he reacted. Belatedly, he reached into his pocket. \u201cWhere\u2019s my wallet\u2026.\u201dXie Yu ate the last bite of rice in his bowl, then picked up a piece of vegetable.\u201cVery good with his hands. Well-honed skills.\u201dHe Zhao pushed up his sleeves, revealing his wrists.Then he got close to the guy and put his hand in the guy\u2019s pocket. As expected, he found something with a soft leather texture. The guy reflexively caught He Zhao\u2019s hand and didn\u2019t let him pull it out. He Zhao said, \u201cI\u2019m damn well saying it only once. Let go.\u201d\u201cBros, it\u2019s a misunderstanding, surely.\u201d The gold-haired man with the snake tattoo spoke the words threateningly, his meaning clear. I\u2019m giving you an out now, so crawl away and pretend this never happened.He Zhao smiled and challenged: \u201cThen you might have misunderstood the word \u2018misunderstanding.\u2019\u201dSo the one with the snake tattoo on his neck threw down his chopsticks and stood up with his buddies. Seven or eight of them, all with gold hair and a formidable stance.Shen Jie looked at the headcount of his side of the fight and wanted to tell He Zhao, Never mind, there\u2019s only ten bucks in my wallet anyway\u2026 (T/N: about US$1.42)He Zhao didn\u2019t see these small fries as a threat at all, but he had to make a show of things. He called out to Xie Yu, \u201cOld Xie, get over here!\u201dThe atmosphere was one of drawn swords and notched arrows. A terrible war was about to break out.Shen Jie looked strong. Others saw that he was always with He Zhao and thought he was a formidable character, too. Actually, he wasn\u2019t that good at fighting, and He Zhao didn\u2019t have any hopes for him.Before their eyes, Xie Yu was still picking out fish bones. He held his chopsticks and meticulously pulled out the fish bones one by one: \u201cYou two go on and fight. Wait for me to finish.\u201dShen Jie:\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe Zhao: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dXie Yu was in a good mood today and didn\u2019t want to kill anything, but there were always idiots offering up their heads.\u201cWhat, looking down on us?\u201d Gold Head walked to their table and flipped the plate of fish to the ground, then kicked the table. It didn\u2019t tip over, so he stepped on the plate of fish on the ground. \u201cEat. I\u2019m saying you can eat. Kneel down and lick it up.\u201dXie Yu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYou could have left me one.\u201dWalking out of the Gold List Restaurant, He Zhao was still complaining that fighting alongside Xie Yu was a bad experience. \u201cDoes anyone steal kills like you do? I was fighting him well and good and you had to drag him away and beat him.\u201dXie Yu said: \u201cYou\u2019re too slow. You call that fighting?\u201dThe three of them squatted by the roadside. Shen Jie pulled out a pack of cigarettes from his pocket and lit one to calm down.The massacre just now was simply shocking.Shen Jie rearranged his mental list of \u2018people to never provoke,\u2019 and put Xie Yu in front of Mad Dog.When He Zhao fought, he took the humiliation approach. He tortured them slowly, using words as attacks to provoke his opponent. He made people long to be beaten and have it over with: \u201cPlease just hit me. Just beat me up.\u201dXie Yu was different. He didn\u2019t say a word and dealt lethal blow after lethal blow, tossing people like he was tossing cabbage.He Zhao turned to Shen Jie and said, \u201cLook in your wallet and check if you\u2019re missing money.\u201dShen Jie pulled the wallet from his pocket and opened it to show them. \u201cIt\u2019s all there. Nothing missing.\u201dA ten-yuan bill.Crisp and new.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cJust this bit of money?\u201d He Zhao felt that he had wasted his effort. \u201cIf it\u2019s just this much, you should have said! If it got stolen then let it be.\u201dXie Yu also said, \u201cJust ten damn bucks?\u201dShen Jie: \u201cI wanted to say it! But I didn\u2019t get a chance!\u201dAfter chatting for a while, Shen Jie looked at the time. He needed to catch the bus home. He said his farewells, then walked in the direction of the bus stop: \u201cThank you, big bros, for graciously lending a hand and protecting my ten bucks for me. See you tomorrow. If I don\u2019t get home, my mom will beat my ass till it flowers.\u201dNight had fallen, the streetlamps bright globes in the darkness.It was evening self-study time and the school gates were tightly shut. To enter the school they\u2019d probably have to climb the walls.He Zhao dusted off his clothes and stood up: \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dAfter walking for a while, one of them laughed out loud, then the two of them started laughing together and couldn\u2019t stop. He Zhao slung an arm around Xie Yu\u2019s neck and whispered, \u201cFuck it. Ten bucks.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

To those not in the know, it might seem like evening self-study had already let out.\u201cWhat are they doing now?\u201d He Zhao lagged behind, struck by a faintly foreboding premonition.Xie Yu leaned against the door frame. With his eyes narrowed, he could just barely make out the classroom interior.Wan Da heard footsteps, turned around, and yelled with surprised joy, \u201cGreat timing! We were about to start. Joining?\u201dHe Zhao retreated two steps but Xie Yu pulled him back.\u201cToday we\u2019re not telling stories,\u201d Wan Da said. \u201cWe\u2019re playing with the occult. Mad Dog just left, so we\u2019re very safe.\u201d\u201cSit here, Zhao-ge. We saved a seat especially for you.\u201d He Zhao was usually quite lively and Wan Da always roped him into things. \u201c\u2026It\u2019s very thrilling.\u201dHe Zhao internally said: Thrilling as shit. Day after day, they don\u2019t study properly and keep getting up to these hijinks.Wan Da felt that leaving Xie Yu standing alone wasn\u2019t appropriate and asked, \u201cYu-ge, are you in?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s in,\u201d He Zhao replied on Xie Yu\u2019s behalf. Since he couldn\u2019t avoid it, he\u2019d drag as many people down with him as possible. \u201cHe\u2019s in.\u201dIn all, four people were playing.The rest stood to the side and watched.Xu Qingqing, the tomboy, was especially brave. She slapped her thigh and said she wanted to be the moderator. \u201cLet me ask!\u201dAs she finished speaking, she picked up the pencil.Wan Da placed his hand over Xu Qingqing\u2019s and didn\u2019t object. \u201cAll right, you ask.\u201dHe Zhao hadn\u2019t intended to do anything, but Wan Da was eyeing him firmly. Clearly Wan Da couldn\u2019t muster up enough courage to have Xie Yu\u2019s hand placed on top of his, so he was pressing He Zhao to put his hand on next.Xie Yu was too distant a person.He hadn\u2019t done anything to give others this feeling. Even if he was just lying there, quietly napping, he made people want to keep a respectful distance. In the whole class, only He Zhao talked and laughed with him and had managed to determinedly survive till now.Xie Yu was the last of them.He lifted his hand and placed it over He Zhao\u2019s. It was a hot summer day, but Xie Yu\u2019s fingertips felt cool against He Zhao\u2019s hand.This chill burned the back of his hand.He Zhao couldn\u2019t tell what exactly this feeling was, either. His thoughts took a strange turn. He had initially been worried about this damn game but suddenly he wasn\u2019t thinking about anything at all.\u201cClose your eyes, close your eyes. Close your eyes first,\u201d Wan Da said. \u201cDon\u2019t open your eyes or the ghost will take your soul when it comes.\u201d\u201cIf our eyes are closed, how will we see where it goes?!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what the walkthrough says to do. Better believe it than not.\u201d\u201cAll right, closing them, closing them. I\u2019ll open them when it comes.\u201dXie Yu didn\u2019t quite believe in ghosts. One of his hands held He Zhao\u2019s and the other supported his head as he turned to look at He Zhao.This guy kept spouting off claims about not being scared and saying, \u2018whoever\u2019s scared is a dog,\u2019 but his eyes were shut tighter than anyone else\u2019s.Before long, He Zhao couldn\u2019t keep himself from asking: \u201cAre we done?\u201dXu Qingqing was still reciting the spell. \u201cPast life, past life, I\u2019m your reincarnation. If you want to link your fate with mine\u2026 don\u2019t cut me off, how could it come so quickly?!\u201dHe Zhao\u2019s eyelashes were very long.Xie Yu stared for a while.Though it was dark in the classroom, Wan Da had turned on a flashlight and aimed it at the piece of paper on the desk, so some of the surroundings were lit up as well.Half of He Zhao\u2019s face was hidden by the night, the other half faintly illuminated by pale light.The bridge of his nose was high, his features chiseled. A youthful energy radiated from his eyes, and when he wasn\u2019t talking or laughing he gave off a strangely oppressive air. There were several piercings on He Zhao\u2019s right ear and Xie Yu suddenly remembered the first time they met during summer vacation; he had been wearing two hoops in his ear, rebellious to the point of impropriety.He Zhao kept his eyes shut and waited a while longer, then really couldn\u2019t hold them shut any more. Wan Da had even put on background music, creepy and faint. Xu Qingqing, too, didn\u2019t recite the spells properly and spoke them like she was possessed.He felt that if he kept holding his eyes shut all the supernatural things would have a fine party all around him.He suddenly opened his eyes and unexpectedly met Xie Yu\u2019s.The two looked at each other. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dXu Qingqing finally finished reciting the spell. Before she asked the question, she reminded everyone again, \u201cDon\u2019t open your eyes. Your soul will be stolen.\u201dXie Yu saw He Zhao staring frozen at him, and thought that this guy was again pretending to be calm while his heart was trembling. He gave a lukewarm smile and mouthed to He Zhao: It\u2019s fake.Xu Qingqing was usually boisterous, but in asking her question she revealed her young girl\u2019s heart. After hesitating for a long time and trying to get everyone to cover their ears, she finally asked: \u201cDoes\u2026 he like me?\u201d\u201cWho?\u201d Wan Da jumped in at the first chance. \u201cName names. Who is this? Why didn\u2019t I know about this? Which pile of cow dung has caught the attention of a flower from our Class 3?\u201dXu Qingqing said, \u201cDo you know how annoying you are? What the hell has it got to do with you?\u201dWan Da: \u201cNot possible. No movement in the entire year can escape my eyes.\u201dXu Qingqing: \u201c\u2026Save it.\u201dEventually the pencil landed on \u2018No.\u2019He Zhao was internally panicking: \u201cThis thing really moves?!\u201d\u201cShh, don\u2019t say that. It\u2019s disrespectful to the pen spirit,\u201d\u00b9 Wan Da said.He Zhao: \u201cWhat happens if we don\u2019t respect it?\u201dWan Da hadn\u2019t prepared a canned response but he heard Xie Yu say, tone decisive and brisk: \u201cIt\u2019ll come find you at night.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe Zhao didn\u2019t have any questions, but Wan Da said it\u2019d be disrespectful to invite the pen spirit then not ask anything. He Zhao thought a while then asked: \u201cIs there anyone in the world more handsome than me?\u201dXu Qingqing: \u201cShameless.\u201dWan Da: \u201cReally shameless.\u201dXie Yu: \u201cHeh.\u201d\u201cBig bro, your turn.\u201d Wan Da winked at Xie Yu.Xie Yu said, \u201cI don\u2019t have any questions, either.\u201dHe Zhao: \u201cNo can do. It\u2019s disrespectful.\u201dXie Yu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dZhou Dalei called Xie Yu. They had hardly spoken two sentences to each other but Zhou Dalei could tell that Boss Xie was in a good mood. \u201cWhat happened to make you so happy?\u201dXie Yu didn\u2019t respond and asked back: \u201cWhat about you? Since you called you\u2019ve been in a happy daze.\u201d\u201cThat idiot, Da Mei, finally called!\u201d Zhou Dalei said. \u201cRelax, I scolded him on your behalf, too. This bastard\u2019s really itching for it. Can\u2019t not yell at him.\u201dDa Mei\u2019s phone call had really been unexpected. It was an international phone call, but surprisingly no one worried about the cost. Lei\u2019s mom and Aunt Mei both lined up to talk to Da Mei, but Zhou Dalei hogged the phone and didn\u2019t let go even under pain of death. In the end, he leaned out the window with his butt sticking out, trying to escape the circling crowd of wolves and tigers looking to snatch away the phone. He had even been kicked twice in the butt by his mom and almost fell out of the fourth floor window.Xie Yu imagined the scene: \u201cThat\u2019s indeed your real mom.\u201dDalei said: \u201cReal mom. What mocking words.\u201d\u201cDa Mei said he\u2019s doing quite well over there and told us not to worry. He\u2019s still a showoff, and said that although he\u2019s not considered that good-looking here, everyone abroad thinks he\u2019s drop-dead gorgeous. And that pot of flowers\u2014that pot of damn flowers really is his precious treasure. He thinks about it all the time.\u201d\u201cI told him that the court where we used to play basketball has been torn down. It was just a few scraps of cloth put together and calling it a court was a compliment. But there\u2019s a new sports center in the area, and a new court! We\u2019ve lived this long and finally got a new court! The new rubber smell in the hot sun, it makes me feel comfortable all over. When he gets back, let\u2019s play basketball together again.\u201dZhou Dalei ranted off a long spiel.Xie Yu listened and occasionally put in a word or two.\u201cBoss Xie, are you going to sleep?\u201d\u201cNope. Keep talking.\u201dZhou Dalei had called from the balcony. In the middle of the night, he was worried about waking his family. He clasped a cigarette between his fingers, the burning tip glowing in the night. He shook the cigarette ash loose and said, \u201cWhat am I saying? Actually, I\u2019m not that well off.\u201dXie Yu didn\u2019t say anything.\u201cEven though I seem to be talking so happily\u2026\u201d Zhou Dalei\u2019s voice quieted down. Whether from smoking or something else, his voice got a little hoarse. \u201cForget it, never mind. What am I even saying?\u201dZhou Dalei stood on the balcony and looked down. It was the same scene he had seen for more than a decade: messy telephone lines and a comforter someone had forgotten to take back in that had blown downstairs.Looking further into the distance, there was a muddy basketball field that had once been fenced up with several lengths of torn cloth. Now it had become a public toilet. The toilet was built better than some of the residences. In a European-style, it\u2019s several pointed roofs standing starkly against the skyline.He was about to hang up when he heard Xie Yu say, \u201cI\u2019m upset, too. Every day all those dogshit things. People calling me Zhong family second young master, eldest young master, second young master. It\u2019s like dumping shit straight in my brain.\u201dThe twisting thoughts in Zhou Dalei\u2019s heart were cursed away by Xie Yu, just like that.He put out the cigarette, laughed, and cursed alongside him: \u201c\u2014young master. I just like to play basketball with my bros surrounded by ripped cloth. If you give me a different court to showcase my talents, the world will be less one NBA basketball star because of it. And this toilet. It\u2019s really fucking ugly. One day, I\u2019ll blow it up for you to see.\u201dThe duo aired all the thoughts they had smothered in their hearts without holding anything back and felt much freer.\u201cI fought alongside an idiot today,\u201d Xie Yu said with a smile. \u201cMy deskmate. You know him.\u201dZhou Dalei asked, \u201cHow would I know your deskmate? We\u2019re not even in the same city. Is he good-looking?\u201dXie Yu said: \u201cA handsome devil.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dZhou Dalei thought about the handsome devils he had seen in his life. There weren\u2019t that many. Aside from his own esteemed self, the remaining people worthy of this moniker consisted only of Xie Yu. He had completely forgotten about the incident in the police station that summer: him, squatting and holding his head, calling someone a handsome devil.\u201cNot possible. You\u2019re pulling my leg, right?\u201dThe two had been chatting for a while when Zhou Dalei suddenly went silent. He froze, then asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s that noise?\u201d\u201cBoss Xie, what\u2019s that noise coming from your end? Strange.\u201dXie Yu heard it too: knocking that came out of nowhere. This time, it was especially close to his dorm room. He said offhand, \u201c\u2026Congrats. This is our dorm ghost.\u201dZhou Dalei said, \u201cThere are ghosts in your dorm???\u201d\u201cPleasant surprise?\u201d Xie Yu said. \u201cTell you about it later. The handsome devil\u2019s probably trembling in his blanket right now and I\u2019m going over there to enjoy watching it.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 44": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fake SlackersChapter 023 - Complete Guide to ExorcismPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayFake SlackersTranslator: JuryEditor: NomNomFirst Published on Chaleuria\u2014023 \u2013 Complete Guide to ExorcismAfter evening self-study, He Zhao stuck to Xie Yu as they returned to the dorm.He even tried to get Wan Da on his left side, so that Xie Yu and Wan Da would be on either side of him, but Wan Da dodged his attempts, very self-aware: \u201cThis-this-this isn\u2019t good, you two can be affectionate together.\u201dXie Yu was a little annoyed: \u201cWith which of your eyes are you seeing affection?\u201dWan Da internally said: With both eyes, actually.He looked at He Zhao who was clinging to Xie Yu with his whole body and didn\u2019t say anything.\u201cDo you want to come to my room and play games?\u201d\u201cNope.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a game tonight. Interested?\u201d\u201cNope.\u201dThey had arrived at their doors. Xie Yu opened his door with his key, but He Zhao didn\u2019t move, refusing to give up or get out of the way: \u201cThe monthly exams are soon. Maybe we could review together?\u201dXie Yu said nothing and simply shut his door.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dXie Yu finished chatting with Zhou Dalei and glanced at the time: 1 a.m.The knocking always came between 12 a.m. and 1 a.m. It happened on a different floor every night, but always between the first and third floors. Perhaps \u201cit\u201d was also wary of trouble and didn\u2019t want to venture further upwards, so the fourth floor and above were safe, for now.If someone really was pretending to be a ghost, this person was also quite determined, forgoing their sleep in the middle of the night.Xie Yu picked up an English mock exam paper. He opened the door and went out. The knocking had stopped and there was nothing at all in the corridor.The motion-sensor light didn\u2019t work too well. The weak light flickered on and off.Xie Yu knocked on the door of the room opposite his and heard something crash into the other side of the door. Then He Zhao\u2019s voice came, sounding like he was on the verge of a breakdown: \u201cAre you still not done?! I dare you to knock again!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dXie Yu knocked twice more.The interior of the room went quiet.He Zhao wrapped himself in his blankets, phone in hand, cursing internally ten thousand times, \u201cfuck.\u201dHe had offhandedly baited the ghost out loud, and this thing had actually understood him.It even played along for his benefit.Xie Yu waited a long time. Once he eliminated the possibility that He Zhao was looking for a weapon to fling open the door, rush out, and run headlong into a fight, he said conciliatorily: \u201cOpen the door, it\u2019s me, your grandpa.\u201dHalf a minute later, the door opened.He Zhao wore a calm, unbothered expression as he opened the door. Full marks for acting. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201dXie Yu wondered if He Zhao had intentionally tousled his hair. Aside from his hair, his wide-open collar was also suspicious. His eyes had been viciously rubbed, like he was trying extremely hard to look like he had been sleeping.He Zhao didn\u2019t let him down. He leaned against the doorframe, body curving, and scratched his head: \u201c\u2026Ah, I was sleeping.\u201dXie Yu looked at him and felt a headache coming on.Someone like He Zhao\u2026 if he died one day, it\u2019d be from over-acting.After a moment, Xie Yu said: \u201cSorry for disturbing.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe Zhao straightened up. \u201cAh?\u201d He wasn\u2019t following the script?Xie Yu felt that he should mind his own business. If He Zhao died then so be it.\u201cYou woke me so you have to take responsibility for me.\u201d He Zhao grabbed on and didn\u2019t let go. He caught a glimpse of the thing in Xie Yu\u2019s hand and said, \u201c\u2026English mock paper? Did you want to study with me? Welcome. You don\u2019t have to be shy. Which questions can\u2019t you answer? I definitely can, and I definitely won\u2019t laugh at you.\u201dHe Zhao: \u201cYou can rest assured if you\u2019re studying with me.\u201dOh, screw off.Xie Yu thought it, but didn\u2019t say it.He Zhao\u2019s dorm room was actually quite comfortable.He had just moved in this semester and didn\u2019t have many things, so it looked quite empty. Xie Yu had pegged He Zhao as the sort who would leave his living space in a mess and didn\u2019t like tidying, but he was surprised by what he saw.He Zhao put away a shirt hanging over a chair, then slapped the back of the chair and said, \u201cSit.\u201dThere was only one chair in the room. He Zhao sat on the bed with his legs crossed, right beside the desk, so that the two could look at the paper together.\u201cOne moment, I\u2019ll find a pen.\u201d He Zhao swung his long legs off the bed and stepped into his slippers.Xie Yu opened the mock exam on the table. Under the faint light of the desk lamp he saw a stack of brand-new textbooks at the side of the desk, probably untouched since the day they were handed out. Beside the books was a metal box for sweets, inside of which were lollipops.\u2026This habit of his.Xie Yu turned away and caught sight of the phone He Zhao had put on the side of the table. The screen was still lit.Five words on the screen were especially eye-catching.The Complete Guide to Exorcism.He Zhao looked for a long time and finally found two pens. Xie Yu took them, not quite sure what they were going to do with them, considering He Zhao\u2019s English level and Xie Yu\u2019s \u2018current level.\u2019As if they could really do the questions.\u201cWhich question shall we start with?\u201d He Zhao removed the pen cap with his teeth and held it in his mouth as he asked.Xie Yu: \u201cYou pick.\u201dHe Zhao circled a multiple-choice question like he was choosing from a harem. \u201cThis one.\u201dXie Yu had no objections. He Zhao stared at the question for a long time, thinking about something.Xie Yu thought about He Zhao\u2019s previous performance in English class. \u201cGive up and go to the next question?\u201dHe Zhao didn\u2019t hear the mockery in these words at all and happily agreed: \u201cI think that\u2019s all right. Let\u2019s look further down then.\u201dXie Yu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe Zhao gave up pretty quickly. They didn\u2019t touch their pens at all before going on to the next page.\u201cLet\u2019s do the reading comprehension,\u201d He Zhao said. \u201cThis one is easy. Trust me. If you have a feel for the language, it\u2019s guessable.\u201dHe Zhao\u2019s confidence as he said these words\u2026 Xie Yu could almost feel it surge out and splatter over his face.\u201cYou have a feel for the language?\u201dHe Zhao: \u201cI do. If there are three short options and one long one, pick the long one. That kind of feel for the language.\u201dIn the end, even He Zhao felt that doing questions like this was too irresponsible. Of course, he might also have been worried the paper would be finished too soon and he would have to hug the Guide to Exorcism to survive the long night. So he suggested that they do the questions properly.\u201cFeel out the intention of the question writer.\u201d He Zhao pulled up Baidu Translate and put in the terms one by one. \u201cFirst, understand the meaning.\u201dThe duo split the work, each translating a part.Xie Yu recognized all the English terms on sight, but he still had to put on a show. He started to wonder if He Zhao was really mentally impaired or if his own acting wasn\u2019t good enough yet.Damn, was this the world of a genuinely bad student?Xie Yu turned and looked at He Zhao, who was sitting on the bed and chewing on his pen cap, totally irreverent.\u201cThis person wrote letters to his friends from America, describing China\u2019s culture and specialties,\u201d He Zhao translated. \u201cThe Great Wall, China\u2019s iconic construction\u2026 this\u2026 wants him to see the Great Wall, if he comes to China.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dEven reading off the translation He Zhao still got the logic muddled.Xie Yu was a little dazed. Holding the pen, he suddenly remembered the day he first stepped through the Zhong family\u2019s front door.Zhong Jie had straight up thrown something, then gone upstairs without another word. Zhong Guofei had followed him upstairs, and father and son had talked in the study for a long time before Zhong Jie reluctantly came down for the four to eat an extremely awkward lunch.Zhong Guofei really did treat Gu Xuelan well, and Xie Yu did believe those two were really in love.But that was Zhong Guofei\u2019s love for Gu Xuelan.That didn\u2019t necessarily mean that Xie Yu would have a share in it.\u201cThat kid Zhong Jie\u2026 he wants to be strong and be better than others at everything.\u201d When Zhong Guofei looked for Xie Yu to talk, his expression held both pride and worry. \u201cEspecially after his mother passed. He hasn\u2019t been coping well.\u201dHe said these words very diplomatically, and Xie Yu wasn\u2019t an idiot. The meaning in it was clear.The day of the wedding, Gu Xuelan was very happy. Xie Jiang had left a pile of debt for them, so they had been hiding and running for their lives for the last ten years. Xie Yu had never seen her smile like that before.Gu Xuelan, wearing her wedding dress, got a little shy as she looked at her reflection in the mirror. \u201cI\u2026 these clothes\u2026\u201dZhong Guofei\u2019s arms encircled her from behind: \u201cVery beautiful.\u201dThat day, Xie Yu had hidden in the bathroom and smoked a cigarette.\u201cShe\u2019s indeed quite beautiful. Who knows how Old Zhong got to know her. This woman isn\u2019t simple.\u201d\u201cThe child she brought with her isn\u2019t simple,\u201d another person said. \u201cIf he\u2019s mediocre, that\u2019s all right, if not\u2026 can\u2019t guarantee what thoughts he\u2019ll have.\u201d\u201cDoesn\u2019t look like him, does he?\u201d\u201cThe Zhong family has a big business. Even if she has no intentions now, this might not be the case in the future. Didn\u2019t the same thing happen to the Huang family? That stepson usually keeps a low profile, but in the end he still made a big scene and tried to snatch the company.\u201d\u201cThe Huang family?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you know? A while ago, a few shareholders got together\u2026\u201d\u201cSo the answer to this is definitely B!\u201dHe Zhao picked the answer with full confidence. The circles he made around his chosen answer looked like a pile of dung. After circling B, he crooked a finger and flicked Xie Yu\u2019s forehead. \u201cHey, what are you thinking?\u201dXie Yu came back to himself and looked down at the circle.This guy, He Zhao. He had done research on Baidu Translate for nearly half an hour\u2026 and still managed to pick wrong.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When he turned, he saw Shen Jie holding a pack of soymilk heading up the stairs, and waved and said hello.He had met Shen Jie during an exam where they had forged a friendship through comparing their answers and cheating together. Although they didn\u2019t talk often, they always had an inexplicable feeling of camaraderie when they met.Shen Jie was about to reach the third floor landing when he heard a shout. \u201cHey, Know-It-All.\u201d\u201cWhy are you at the dorms?\u201d Wan Da walked over. \u201cLooking for Zhao-ge?\u201dWan Da saw the bag in Shen Jie\u2019s hand swinging back and forth and felt the impulse to grab it and spin around in circles. \u201cYes.\u201dWan Da remembered that He Zhao had skipped morning classes and the subject teachers were all very angry about it. He said in understanding, \u201cZhao-ge asked you to come get him? Not a morning person, huh.\u201d\u201cComrade Know-It-All, what do you take Zhao-ge for?\u201d Shen Jie asked. \u201cDoes he look like the sort of person who would ask people to come get him in order to not be late for class? You think too highly of him.\u201dWan Da: \u201c\u2026Indeed, I was too naive.\u201dShen Jie continued, \u201cYour class\u2019s new form teacher\u2026 he\u2019s not bad.\u201d\u201cMr. Tang?\u201d\u201cAh, right, the one surnamed Tang.\u201dClass 2.3 had gone through the perturbations of changing form teachers together. When they wrote the petition, a feeling of rising up for great justice had rippled through the whole second year class. Wan Da smiled and said, \u201cOld Tang is quite a good guy.\u201dShen Jie: \u201cReally formidable. Never seen anything like this before.\u201dTang Sen had not only called He Zhao over to have a very long and ugly conversation, he had even tried to understand He Zhao\u2019s soul on a deeper level. Eventually, he had even called Shen Jie over.This was the first time Shen Jie had been called to the office by a teacher from a different class. He drank two cups of piping hot tea and sat there, unsure what to do with himself. \u201cSir, I\u2019m from Class 2.8.\u201dTang Sen said kindly: \u201cI know you\u2019re from class 8.\u201d\u201cI quite like the students in my class. They\u2019re cordial and friendly, and students and teachers help each other, moving forward hand in hand. I\u2019m quite happy and don\u2019t have any intention to change classes right now.\u201d Shen Jie felt like the teacher was eyeing him strangely and wondered if Tang Sen was trying to poach him.In the end, Tang Sen explained that he had sent for Shen Jie in the hopes that Shen Jie could help He Zhao.\u201cI looked into it and you have quite a good relationship with our He Zhao. I think that, in his heart, he does want to come to class, but the difficulty lies in fighting the draw of his bed and winning. He doesn\u2019t have much self-control. If possible, would you invite him to come to class with you? Sorry for the inconvenience.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dShen Jie was a little shocked but still replied, \u201cSure, sure, sure, I will.\u201dTang Sen continued, \u201cI know that young people like you have rich night lives. I also want to understand what video games you young people are playing these days. Do you know if He Zhao has been playing any video games recently?\u201d\u201cWhat games is Zhao-ge playing these days?\u201d Wan Da asked.\u201cIt\u2019s a little hard to talk about.\u201d Shen Jie stopped swinging the plastic bag in his hands. His expression was complicated as he said, \u201c\u2026Miracle. Miracle Nikki.\u201dWan Da: \u201c\u2026Hah?\u201dThe two talked as they walked upstairs. Wan Da wasn\u2019t sure why he was following along, but by the time he realized what he was doing, he and Shen Jie were both standing in front of He Zhao\u2019s door.Shen Jie\u2019s mission today was to drag Zhao-ge from his blankets.He happened to have a key to He Zhao\u2019s room. He had bugged He Zhao on the first day of school for half a day before getting his hands on it. The winds of fortune had blown his way: when he wanted to skip class, he could go to the dorms and hide out in perfect comfort.Shen Jie opened the door and said, \u201cLet me release your seal, Zhao-ge! Although the bed may trap your body, it cannot trap your soul.\u2026 Get up, and come with me\u2026\u201dShen Jie cut himself off halfway.Wan Da urged him from behind: \u201cStill sleeping? Just shake him awake.\u201dWan Da walked up, glanced inside the dorm room, and was also stunned speechless.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cCan you hit me?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026 hit me, too.\u201dThe beds in the dorm room were singles where more than one occupant would make for a tight squeeze.The thermostat was turned down low and a gust of cold air had rushed out the moment the door opened.Xie Yu\u2019s head was pillowed on He Zhao\u2019s arm. His back was to the door and it looked like he was lying in He Zhao\u2019s embrace from where Shen Jie was standing.A corner of the blanket lay against He Zhao\u2019s waist. Most of the comforter was covering Xie Yu.Half of Xie Yu\u2019s face was covered by his hair, revealing only his nose and chin. Probably disturbed by the noise, he frowned in his sleep and subconsciously burrowed deeper into the blanket.This movement, in turn, disturbed He Zhao.Shen Jie watched as He Zhao, in a very natural movement, raised the arm Xie Yu was using as a pillow. His hand moved, turned, and landed on the back of Xie Yu\u2019s head, fingers threading lightly into Xie Yu\u2019s hair as he murmured, \u201c\u2026Don\u2019t fuss.\u201dWan Da calmed down. He wasn\u2019t sure what to say and eventually just said, \u201cWo-ow.\u201d\u201cMaybe it\u2019s not what we\u2019re thinking.\u201d At last, Shen Jie closed the door and sat in the stairwell with Wan Da, thinking hard. The soymilk was left on the floor. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely thinking too far in the wrong direction.\u201dWan Da asked, \u201cDoes Zhao-ge let you lie in his bed, too?\u201dShen Jie didn\u2019t even need to think about it. \u201cImpossible. The moment I lie down he\u2019ll certainly kick me off.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe conversation died again.Wan Da patted Shen Jie\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYour responsibility is heavy. Bro, I\u2019m gonna go. Class is about to start.\u201dXie Yu\u2019s circadian rhythm was very accurate and he slept lightly. Shen Jie opening the door just now had already half woken him up.He lay on the bed, intentionally dawdling for several minutes. When he opened his eyes, the first thing he saw was He Zhao\u2019s Adam\u2019s apple.Shen Jie was still sitting on the stairs in deep thought.Then he heard something crash onto the ground behind him with a dull thud, followed by Zhao-ge\u2019s cursing: \u201cFuck it.\u201dMorning class was Tang Sen\u2019s literature reading period. He Zhao was already more than ten minutes late.\u201cCan you walk faster?\u201d Xie Yu was supporting him and he was already frustrated by the time they arrived at the base of the class building.He Zhao, who was holding soymilk, shot back, \u201c\u2026Whose fault is this?\u201dBright and early in the morning, he had been kicked out of bed by Xie Yu and his right ankle had crashed straight into the chair.When they reached the floor their classroom was on, they could see from afar that Tang Sen was waiting outside the classroom doorway. He paced back and forth in the corridor, something in his hand.He Zhao had almost finished the cup of soymilk in his hand. He raised his arm and tossed it toward the trash can, the cup making an elegant arc.Thud.It didn\u2019t swerve or miss. It landed perfectly.\u201cThe Spanish Inquisition is lying in wait,\u201d He Zhao laughed. \u201cSorry. You might end up standing in the corridor with me.\u201dFor some unknown reason, the more Xie Yu interacted with He Zhao, the more he got the impression that most of He Zhao\u2019s smiles were a habitual facade. Right now, for example, he didn\u2019t actually seem all that happy.He Zhao thought that Tang Sen had come to interrogate them, but Mr. Tang stopped the stopwatch in his hand and patted He Zhao\u2019s back. \u201cThirteen minutes and twenty-six seconds. Classmate He Zhao, that\u2019s a big improvement from yesterday.\u201dHe Zhao: \u201c\u2026Ah?\u201dMr. Tang put the watch away and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with your foot? Quick, go to the nurse\u2019s office to take a look.\u201dBefore He Zhao could react, Tang Sen had already bent down to inspect He Zhao\u2019s ankle. He said, worried, \u201cXie Yu, you go to class first. I\u2019ll take him to the nurse\u2019s office.\u201dXie Yu\u2019s liking for Mr. Tang promptly increased quite a lot. He was about to agree when He Zhao said, \u201cToday, this guy has to be responsible for me till the end.\u201dXie Yu: \u201c\u2026I should\u2019ve broken your other leg, too.\u201dLiu Cunhao was halfway through reciting a poem. He stopped and whispered in Wan Da\u2019s ear, \u201cZhao-ge\u2019s leg injury today looks very realistic.\u201dWhen He Zhao was late for class, he always had an excuse at the ready.Class 3 was already guessing what excuse Zhao-ge would have for being late today.[Eng Rep \u2013 Xu Qingqing]: Didn\u2019t get it right. This time Zhao-ge\u2019s excuse is really exciting.[Class Rep \u2013 Liu Cunhao]: Do you remember the day school started, when he made Shen Jie say he had something gastric? Shen Jie still gets dragged by Zhao-ge to the nurse\u2019s office to get medicine sometimes.[Gym Rep \u2013 Luo Wenqiang]: Why?[Class Rep \u2013 Liu Cunhao]: Zhao-ge says it\u2019s to make a useless thing useful. Might need the excuse next time. If he has to act, he\u2019s gotta act to the very end.[Eng Rep \u2013 Xu Qingqing]: \u2026\u2026Liu Cunhao finished chatting, then secretively stuffed his phone away. The he discovered that Wan Da, who was usually the King of Gossip, hadn\u2019t moved. \u201cWhat happened to you today? Upset?\u201dWan Da shook his head: \u201cI suffered trauma this morning.\u201dWan Da\u2019s phone was vibrating constantly, but it wasn\u2019t from Class 3\u2019s private group chat. It was from some Feng Feng or Yan Yan, whom he wasn\u2019t sure he even knew. After being single for seventeen years, who would\u2019ve known that he\u2019d also be surrounded by girls one day.\u2013What\u2019s the phone number for He Zhao from your class? Just give it to me, I promise I won\u2019t say I got it from you.\u2013Da Da, we\u2019ve known each other for so many years. Help me out? I wrote a letter and want to give it to Xie Yu. Could you give it to him for me?\u2013Damn you grandpa what\u2019s taking you so long! Are we friends?! It\u2019s taking you so much effort just to bring He Zhao out.

    "Chapter 46": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fake SlackersChapter 024b - All the other kids have gone to play basketball.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayFake SlackersTranslator: JuryEditor: NomNomFirst Published on Chaleuria\u2014024b \u2013 All the other kids have gone to play basketball.In the school doctor\u2019s office.The school doctor was very familiar with He Zhao and even knew him by name. He wore a white coat and sat at his desk, writing out a prescription. When he saw He Zhao walk through the door, he said, \u201cYo, what\u2019s the matter today?\u201dHalf of He Zhao\u2019s weight rested on Xie Yu\u2019s body as he greeted the school doctor: \u201cMorning, Lu-ge.\u201dXie Yu walked He Zhao over to the bed and helped him sit.Tang Sen was the only one who looked worried: \u201cDr. Lu, you\u2019d better take a look. Seems like a serious sprain. Do you think it\u2019s better to prescribe medicine or to go to the hospital for a diagnosis?\u201dDr. Lu looked gentle and scholarly, but he also wasn\u2019t to be trifled with. Many students faked sick every day and if he had been a pushover, the school doctor\u2019s office would have become a shelter for students playing truant.He finished the prescription, tore it off, put it neatly to one side, then put down his pen and stood up. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. This lot, especially this one from your class, He Zhao, are really good act\u2013\u201dDr. Lu bent down as he spoke. When he touched He Zhao\u2019s ankle he swallowed back the words \u2018good actors.\u2019 \u201cReally twisted it, have you.\u201dThe injury didn\u2019t reach the bone. After a cold compress to reduce the swelling, the school doctor also sprayed some White Yunnan medicine on the ankle.\u201cRest for a few days, no vigorous exercise,\u201d Dr. Lu said. \u201cIf there are any complications or you don\u2019t feel well, come over. Be careful, and don\u2019t dwell on it and go out and start a fight. If you fight any more you\u2019ll become a cripple.\u201dHe Zhao\u2019s ankle attracted a crowd the moment he returned to class.Liu Cunhao lay on the table and looked He Zhao over from top to bottom, saying thoughtfully, \u201c\u2026Looks pretty real.\u201dThe gym rep, Luo Wenqiang, had also come to join in on the fun. He was a very enthusiastic promoter of sports activities and was very familiar with common injuries. He could tell at a glance: \u201cIt\u2019s real. Class rep, he really twisted it.\u201dRecently, they had been practicing basketball in gym class. Luo Wenqiang was trying to get a team together. Although there wasn\u2019t a tournament coming up, his sports-loving heart was constantly on the move.The first person he had intended to invite was He Zhao.It was rather a pity that He Zhao now had a twisted ankle.Liu Cunhao said, \u201cAh, it\u2019s real? What happened?\u201dXu Qingqing came over to collect the English assignments from yesterday. He Zhao looked for his paper as he replied, \u201cYou\u2019ll have to ask my deskmate.\u201dXie Yu said calmly, \u201cI kicked him. Sorry.\u201dXu Qingqing took the paper and was surprised. \u201cYou\u2019re not handing in a blank sheet today?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the work I did seriously,\u201d He Zhao said. \u201cI scare even myself when I get serious. It\u2019s definitely good.\u201dXu Qingqing gave the first page a cursory glance, then flipped to the reading comprehension questions in the back. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Based on what she knew of these questions, none of his answers were right.But she worried that saying this aloud would be a blow to He Zhao\u2019s confidence, so she was instead about to give some words of praise when she heard Xie Yu say in a lukewarm voice from the side, \u201cGood, my ass. You might as well have handed in a blank paper.\u201dYeah.Very well said.Xu Qingqing almost applauded.They had gym class in the morning. Dr. Lu had given He Zhao a note and Luo Wenqiang let him stay in the classroom to rest.He Zhao said rest, but he really meant sleep.He Zhao lay on the desk and one could only see the back of his head from any angle. Although he was wearing his school uniform neatly, he radiated a languid air. The corridor was noisy and he couldn\u2019t sleep well, so he turned his head and changed his position, his arm lining up with the edge of the table.\u201cHe Zhao and Xie Yu, this pair of deskmates\u2026 I don\u2019t even know what to say.\u201d When the class dismissal bell rang, the English teacher returned to the faculty office and got water from the cooler. \u201cThe English papers they turned in today had identical answers. Neat and tidy. Don\u2019t know who copied from who\u2026 but what\u2019s the point of copying, anyway? Not a single right answer. All wrong.\u201dThe Math teacher was currently correcting assignments. Aside from the two words, \u2018Xie Yu,\u2019 written neatly on the cover of the workbook in big letters with a sharp and cold handwriting, the contents were a terrible sight. He frowned and shook his head. \u201cWith these grades, how did he even get into high school? Even his middle school knowledge is wrong.\u201dAnother older teacher counselled them, \u201cAs long as they don\u2019t make trouble, it\u2019s all right. If I do say so myself, the two of them have actually improved some this term. They\u2019re more restrained. Looks like this seating assignment was actually quite useful. As for their grades\u2026 grades can\u2019t be rushed, anyway.\u201dThe teacher continued, \u201cLook at Old Tang. He\u2019s so calm. Not worried at all.\u201dTang Sen had transferred over from a top-tier school. Although he had taught for nearly twenty years, they didn\u2019t know him very well. They only knew that he was old friends with Dean Jiang; they had over ten years of friendship between them.Dean Jiang was an \u2018overbearing\u2019 person, but his friend, Tang Sen, had a good temper.Tang Sen was looking down and fiddling with his phone, and seemed not to hear. He only looked up when the teacher called him a second time. \u201cWhat? Sorry, sorry, wasn\u2019t paying attention.\u201d\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d The English teacher had gotten her water. As she passed by she stopped, bent down, and looked. \u201c\u2026A game?\u201dOn the screen was a long-haired cartoon girl wearing a dress. To the side was a list of various types of clothes.Tang Sen immediately exited the app and returned to the home screen, not sure how to explain. \u201cAh\u2026 that\u2026\u201dThankfully, the English teacher had just taken a passing glance and hadn\u2019t looked too closely. The class rep knocked on the door, asking for the corrected exercise books from the English teacher. She turned around, the little interlude from just now already forgotten. \u201cClass 8, right? The vocab exercises are marked. They\u2019re on the table. The assignments from three of the classes are all over there\u2014find your class\u2019s yourself.\u201dGym class was basketball practice, as usual.The girls had more academic class time in their schedules and, as a result, hadn\u2019t participated in this kind of activity before. When the ball flew over their first reaction wasn\u2019t to catch it, but to hide their faces in their hands and dodge or duck. The gym teacher took them aside to practice on their own while the guys took the basketball and were allowed free activity time.Xu Qingqing wasn\u2019t worried about getting hit. And after practicing for a while she felt bored and ran over to the guys to play.\u201cQiangqiang, I hear your team still needs players.\u201d Xu Qingqing walked over, bouncing the ball. \u201cWhat do you think about me? Can I join?\u201dLuo Wenqiang was currently practising shooting baskets. His muscles were tanned bronze and he looked like a bodybuilder. He jumped, tossed the basketball, wiped off his sweat, and said, \u201cQing-jie, are you being serious?\u201dXie Yu had his back to the chain-link fence of the basketball court. He sat under the shade, an earbud stuffed in one ear.Music drifted through his ear.He suddenly lifted his hand to the volume control. The music grew quieter and quieter until, finally, it was muted.Xu Qingqing: \u201cVery serious. Think about when our class joins a tournament.\u201dBefore she finished, Wan Da came up from behind and took the ball from her. He ran off as he laughed, \u201cIf that time really comes, our class will definitely be in last place.\u201dAs Wan Da ran away, he crashed into Liu Cunhao and knocked the ball in Liu Cunhao\u2019s hand flying.Liu Cunhao immediately exploded. \u201cYou get over here! I was preparing to shoot a three-pointer, do you know?!\u201dAs Xie Yu was watching them, he felt something ice-cold suddenly stick to his face. He turned to see He Zhao at his side. At some point he had limped up next to Xie Yu, two bottles of chilled soda in his hand.\u201cLittle friend,\u201d He Zhao stuffed the soda into Xie Yu\u2019s hand and said, \u201cAll the other kids have gone to play basketball. Why are you sitting around here on your own?\u201dThe soda was peach-flavored and the condensation on the side of the can wet Xie Yu\u2019s hand.Wan Da caught sight of He Zhao. Wan Da, who was currently being pursued by both Xu Qingqing and Liu Cunhao, yelled from afar, \u201cZhao-ge, why are you here?\u201dHe Zhao said: \u201cCame down to see my suave deskmate.\u201dWan Da tripped and nearly fell.He Zhao twisted open the bottle cap and the smell of peach emerged alongside a cold mist. \u201cIt\u2019s too boring in the classroom and that group of girls is chittering outside. Couldn\u2019t even sleep.\u201d\u201cThat lot wasn\u2019t there to see you,\u201d Xie Yu said.\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t they be here to see me\u2026 I still don\u2019t understand this logic. Wan Da said that last time, too.\u201dThe whole year knew about He Zhao\u2019s twisted ankle. This group of girls was so worried they couldn\u2019t pay attention in class.\u201cWhat do you think they stand in the corridor every day during class to do?\u201dHe Zhao lifted his head and took a drink of the cold and refreshing drink, then said, \u201cHow would I know? To see the scenery? To get some sunlight and vitamin D?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dGoing by EQ, this person was an idiot.Now that Xie Yu was thinking about EQ, he paused for a moment. He poked He Zhao with the sweating bottle. \u201cHey, cripple, have you been in a relationship before?\u201dHe Zhao was currently watching Luo Wenqiang and the others play basketball. Aside from Luo Wenqiang, who was passable, the others were, frankly speaking, terrible. It seemed like they were only there to mess things up. But he wasn\u2019t stingy with his praise: \u201cGood throw! Hao-zi, you\u2019re damn good at the snake dodge.\u201d\u00b9Liu Cunhao turned his head and made a \u2018Cool!\u2019 hand gesture, looking full of confidence.He Zhao felt something cold against his forearm and then reacted to what Xie Yu said. \u201cI just twisted my ankle. Surely you don\u2019t have to call me a cripple?\u201d\u201cTo be frank.\u201d He Zhao rested his arm on Xie Yu\u2019s shoulder and pointed to the basketball court\u2019s metal gate like he was bragging. \u201cYou could line up big bro\u2019s exes back to back from over there to Gold List Restaurant and back.\u201dWithout a second word, Xie Yu smashed the soda into He Zhao\u2019s face.\u201cI was joking! Joking.\u201d He Zhao raised his hand to his face and it came away wet. \u201c\u2026Little friend, your temper is rather hot.\u201dAfter gym class let out, they discovered that He Zhao and Xie Yu\u2019s English practice papers had been put up on a little noticeboard beside the blackboard. A public shaming.Beside theirs was posted the paper with the highest score in the class, Xu Qingqing\u2019s 120-point paper, a stark comparison.Class 2.3 trickled back from the basketball courts.Liu Cunhao came over to rubberneck and was stunned speechless for a long time. \u201cThe two of you\u2026 the two of you\u2026 why did you copy from each other?!\u201d Even if they really had to copy from someone, copying from each other of all things? Weren\u2019t they aware of what their grades were like?\u201cBecause I believe in my deskmate.\u201d He Zhao was sitting in the last row, very close to the noticeboard. He turned around and sat with his legs to either side of the chair back, extremely eye-catching. \u201cAnd my deskmate believes in me.\u201dFor a long time, Liu Cunhao wasn\u2019t sure what to say. He wiped away the sweat from playing basketball just now and said, \u201cYou two sure are brave.\u201dThe reality was that Xie Yu hadn\u2019t intended to write his paper like this.But after observing last evening, He Zhao\u2019s answering ability was frankly terrifying.Xie Yu finally understood why, in his first year, although he had put in so much effort and thought into lowering his score in order to fail all his subjects, he had still only been second-to-last in the year.The precious throne of \u2018last in the year\u2019 was claimed firmly by He Zhao.So Xie Yu intentionally avoided picking the right answers while doing questions. He resolved that he\u2019d outdo He Zhao and take first place in the monthly exams.First place from the bottom.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 47": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fake SlackersChapter 024c - All the other kids have gone to play basketballPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayFake SlackersTranslator: JuryEditor: NomNomFirst Published on Chaleuria\u2014024 \u2013 All the other kids have gone to play basketballAs the monthly exams neared, Wan Da and the others stopped telling ghost stories and focused on revision during evening self study.Mad Dog came around to check on them. Seeing Class 2.3\u2019s enthusiasm for studying, he was satisfied with what he saw, a rare occurrence. \u201cNot bad. I\u2019m giving you special praise. Keep it up. Your class has worked very hard lately. Students should study like this. Very good.\u201dTang Sen finished dinner and came over to see them. Even though it was a hot summer day, he was still holding a hot beverage cup.Mad Dog: \u201cOld Tang. Good timing. I have something to talk to you about.\u201dTang Sen left his cup on the podium and followed Dean Jiang out.\u201cDon\u2019t you feel that Mad Dog has been coming to our class a lot lately?\u201d Wan Da gossiped as he did his math questions. \u201cOur Old Tang is good friends with Mad Dog. Such good friends, they even wear the same pair of pants.\u201dHe Zhao\u2019s books lay open on his desk while his hands messed with his phone in his desk drawer.Teachers rarely gave the two of them, He Zhao and Xie Yu, trouble, but Mad Dog was an exception. Old ginger is more spicy and Dean Jiang was the spiciest of the bunch. When he started trying to \u2018cure\u2019 people, he had no restraint and gave the impression that he could start fighting with the students at any time. He wasn\u2019t worried at all. He must have been a tyrant who ruled over the land when he was young.So whenever Mad Dog came around to check on the class, the two of them would pretend to be studying along with the rest of the class, however reluctantly.Xie Yu tossed a pen over and warned He Zhao. \u201cMad Dog.\u201d\u201cCover for me,\u201d He Zhao said, not even lifting his head. \u201cThis is an important event and I can\u2019t be distracted. Love you.\u201d\u201cTake those last two words back.\u201d\u201c\uff1f\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s disgusting.\u201dAfter throwing the pen, Xie Yu found that it was his only pen, so he reached out to get it back.And accidentally glimpsed He Zhao\u2019s phone screen.In Xie Yu\u2019s memory, his deskmate had long since put the dressup game aside. He had even gotten Xie Yu to play a \u2018Men\u2019s Romance\u2019\u2014a shooter game.He had assumed that the dressup game was no longer popular in the little girls\u2019 cliques.Dean Jiang chatted with Old Tang for a while before leaving to check on the classes downstairs. He Zhao straightforwardly took his phone out and used it in plain sight on top of the desk.The screen showed a cartoon girl with long hair, a floral dress, and a blush on her cheeks. She stood under a tree, hands locked in prayer.Then the screen gradually darkened and several lines of text slowly appeared:Tomorrow\u2026 is my date with him\u2026Will he come?Will he like the cherry blossom biscuits I made for him?Xie Yu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWan Da had said, \u2018I want to revise, and I\u2019ll show you all at the monthly exams, none of you better come over and disturb me,\u2019 but he was now halfway through his questions and, frankly speaking, bored. He bit the end of his pen and glanced left and right. Finally, his gaze landed on two heads pressed closely together in the last row.He Zhao\u2019s hand was on the back of Xie Yu\u2019s neck, five fingers slightly bent, as if pulling Xie Yu closer.He had no idea what they were talking about.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t he go on the date with me?\u201d He Zhao was close to breaking. \u201cBastard. He said yesterday that he would come, and the affection meter is full.\u201dXie Yu looked at the young girl crying sorrowfully in the rain on the screen and wasn\u2019t sure how to react.In the lower right corner were several icons and one of them had a small red dot. Xie Yu asked, \u201cDid he send you a text just now?\u201dHe Zhao said, \u201cTyrant CEO said something came up at his company and he\u2019d be a little late. Then there were three response choices.\u201dXie Yu felt like he\u2019d discovered something. \u201cWhich did you pick?\u201dHe Zhao: \u201cOf course I reprimanded him for being late.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAre you sick?\u201d Xie Yu was getting a headache just from listening. \u201cWho the hell would go on a date with you like this?\u201d\u201cWhat kind of guy is this?! Just because of that, he won\u2019t date me?! This bastard CEO.\u201d He Zhao kept cursing, but he still shoved the phone into Xie Yu\u2019s hands. \u201cThen what do I do next\u2026 fuck, the bastard\u2019s affection for Little Cutie is going down.\u201dXie Yu tapped on the screen lightly, following the narrative. \u201cApologize to the bastard.\u201dHe Zhao: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cApologize.\u201d Xie Yu shoved the phone back. \u201cDo you want the bastard\u2019s love or not?\u201d\u201c\u2026Fuck it.\u201dHe Zhao hesitated for a long time without doing anything. Eventually, he held back his humiliation and touched the choice, \u201cSorry about earlier today.\u201dHe Zhao continued, \u201cIf He Xi finds a boyfriend like this, I\u2019m killing him. Won\u2019t even think twice. What the hell do girls today even look for?\u201dIt was almost the weekend.Aside from the students for whom it wasn\u2019t convenient to go home because they lived far away, most of the students living in the dorms packed up every Friday and went home. Parents always worried whether their kids were eating enough at school, so they urged their kids to come back during the weekends.Xie Yu got a phone call from Gu Xuelan as evening self-study let out. \u201cAre you coming home over the weekend?\u201dXie Yu stood in the corridor. In front of him was pitch darkness, and behind him were the sounds of Wan Da and He Zhao messing around. The desks and chairs were being shoved around, making a terrible noise.\u201cZhao-ge, do you want to join our basketball team? We\u2019re very good.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine if I\u2019m giving the compliments, but now you come up and personally brag to me\u2026 that\u2019s a bit too much. Liu Cunhao\u2019s terrible dodge from earlier today\u2026 even I couldn\u2019t bring myself to say anything.\u201d\u201c\u2026You called him awesome!\u201d\u201c\u2026That was fake, couldn\u2019t you tell?\u201dXie Yu smiled slightly and replied, \u201cI might not go back. We\u2019ll see.\u201dGu Xuelan held on to the receiver, sighing so lightly Xie Yu almost couldn\u2019t hear it. Then she said, \u201cHow many weeks has it been now that you haven\u2019t come back?\u201dXie Yu looked for a reason all parents under the sun would be happy to hear and shoved it forward. \u201cIt\u2019s almost the monthly exams. I have to revise.\u201dThis term, Xie Yu\u2019s grades were all right. He hadn\u2019t gotten into trouble, and the new homeroom teacher, Mr. Tang, told Gu Xuelan that Xie Yu followed the rules quite well and that he hoped she would rest easy.When this reason was offered, Madam Gu had nothing more to say.\u201cThen study hard,\u201d Gu Xuelan said. \u201cAfter the exams, come home. Whatever you want to eat, Mom will make it for you. How can school food be as good as home cooking\u2026\u201dXie Yu said, \u201cMm,\u201d several times and chatted a little while, then hung up.He Zhao had already packed his things. He knocked Xie Yu\u2019s head from behind as he laughed and joked. Rather than knocked, ruffled would be more appropriate. \u201cLittle friend, are you going home for the weekend?\u201dXie Yu looked cold and harsh, but his hair was especially soft. He Zhao couldn\u2019t help himself and ruffled it twice more.\u201cCripple,\u201d Xie Yu called out. \u201cI gave you a hard time today and now you\u2019re opening a dye shop, are you?\u201d\u00b9Seeing Xie Yu was about to use his fists, He Zhao dodged. \u201cCalm down. Peace breeds prosperity, peace breeds prosperity.\u201dWan Da left first to pack his things.Xie Yu and He Zhao walked side-by-side out of the school building. After a very long time, He Zhao said, \u201cI\u2019m not going back over the weekend, either.\u201dThe streetlights cast long shadows behind them.\u201cWhat are you staying in school for?\u201d Xie Yu asked. \u201cReally testing the Exorcism Guide?\u201dHe Zhao was first stunned, then wanted to say something but didn\u2019t in the end. He didn\u2019t put on any of his colorful acts. He raised his hand to scratch at his head, then suddenly laughed. \u201cYeah, I want to try it.\u201dAfter walking a little further, Xie Yu asked, \u201cHe Xi. Is that your sister\u2019s name?\u201d\u201cThat damn girl.\u201d He Zhao stared at the streetlights and grit out the words, then went silent for a moment. \u201c\u2026Should I brag about how beautiful my sister is and how she obviously takes after me? We haven\u2019t seen each other in a few years. She\u2019s probably quite pretty. Girls change a lot when they grow up, right? She was so ugly when she was young. As round as a ball.\u201dHe Zhao said it lightly and Xie Yu felt that something seemed off, but it didn\u2019t seem like the right time to ask.He Zhao, on the other hand, was fine with it and spilled his entire family history. Simple and clean and especially calm. \u201cDivorced. She\u2019s with my mom.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nice.\u201dHe Zhao turned. \u201cWhat?\u201dXie Yu said, \u201cYour sister\u2019s name.\u201d\u201cAnd what about me?\u201d He Zhao asked. \u201cAt this point in the conversation you should compliment me, too.\u201dXie Yu walked toward the dorm building, ignoring him. \u201cYou? Get lost.\u201dWan Da didn\u2019t go home over the weekend, either. His reason was the same as Xie Yu\u2019s\u2014\u201cI need to revise\u201d\u2014but the believability of his excuse was much higher than Xie Yu\u2019s.\u201cI\u2019m serious. My mom makes very good food and my computer is at home and I spend too much time playing.\u201d Wan Da lay on the table and complained to Liu Cunhao about his troubles. \u201cThe moment I get home, it\u2019s like summer or winter break again. I can\u2019t control myself. How could I waste such a glorious life on studying?\u201dLiu Cunhao nudged him with a forearm, indicating to him to shut up.Wan Da sat up straight and looked around, then lay back down. \u201cWhat are you doing? No teachers are around\u2026 even if there are, I\u2019m not worried.\u201dThere were no teachers around but Class 2.3\u2019s respected, terrifying study rep was.Xue Xisheng was famous in the year. He was every teacher\u2019s pet and a holy man in the eyes of students. \u201cI hope everyone can fight, strive, and improve together.\u201d His desk was full of little notes, mnemonics, vocabulary words, sentence structures\u2026Xue Xisheng wore thick spectacles and he carried a stack of extra practice questions as he walked in.Xu Qingqing passed by. She bumped into him and jumped from shock. \u201c\u2026Study rep, your eyebags.\u201dXue Xisheng\u2019s footsteps were silent and he looked extremely overworked. He pushed up his spectacles with one hand and said, \u201cIt\u2019s all right. I can keep studying. Good luck on the monthly exams, Xu Qingqing.\u201d\u201cGood\u2026 good luck.\u201d Xu Qingqing wasn\u2019t sure what to say and replied blankly.Liu Cunhao: \u201cMad Dog has a phrase, what is it\u2026 You won\u2019t die from studying, so study until you die. I think our study rep is the representation of that.\u201dWa Da was dazed: \u201cSo dark circles can become that dark.\u201dHe Zhao wasn\u2019t late today. He walked into class right after Xie Yu. \u201cGood morning.\u201dWan Da: \u201cGood morning.\u201d\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d He Zhao had his bag slung over one shoulder as he went over.Liu Cunhao said: \u201cLooking at the study rep\u2019s dark circles.\u201d\u201cDamn, they\u2019re dark.\u201d Even He Zhao was shocked.Xie Yu was walking around them, about to go to his side of the desk to sleep. Without even looking back, He Zhao caught Xie Yu\u2019s wrist and pulled him over. \u201cOld Xie, look. Those dark circles. How long has it been since he slept?\u201dEarly in the morning, Xue Xisheng had brewed a cup of coffee. He drank it now as he memorized English vocabulary.Xie Yu had no interest in dark undereye circles. He just wanted to catch up on sleep and reached out to pull He Zhao\u2019s hand away.He Zhao was still rubbernecking the \u2018panda.\u2019 But his thought processes weren\u2019t quite like an average person\u2019s and as he looked, his train of thought shifted gears. \u201cDid he draw them on himself? When I was young, in order to pretend that I was studying hard, I did that to hoodwink my mom.\u201dXie Yu said sarcastically, \u201cDo you think we can really find another you in this world?\u201dHe Zhao: \u201cYou\u2019re praising me so much that I even feel a little shy.\u201dXie Yu said internally, Like hell I\u2019m praising you.He Zhao often didn\u2019t read between the lines and kept on going, totally unaware of the atmosphere. \u201cIn the entire world, there\u2019s only one of your Zhao-ge.\u201dWan Da applauded from the side. \u201cClassy.\u201dLiu Cunhao also applauded. \u201cA flower among flowers.\u201dMorning self-study was math.The math teacher took advantage of everyone being more alert in the morning and made everyone memorize the standard answer formats.He found a chair and sat at the podium to correct today\u2019s homework.Xie Yu lay on the table and slept. The sun shone in from the window.Xie Yu faintly felt the glare against his eyelids. He frowned, still half-asleep. After a while, the annoying light, which seemed to come through a layer of paper, disappeared again.\u201cAnd about the homework returned yesterday. If you didn\u2019t get it right, do corrections quickly. You have to work out the questions you get wrong every day, otherwise it\u2019ll pile up.\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t understand, bring them over and ask me or a classmate. When you\u2019re done correcting it, show it to me. I have to record these\u2026 don\u2019t wait for me to come find you. If I really come find you someday, you\u2019re done for.\u201dThe math teacher finished his spiel and looked down at the homework he was correcting again.The classroom was very quiet.There were the small sounds of pages flipping, pencil cases knocking together, the sound of correction tape, and the sound of students reading aloud in the other classes.He Zhao rested one arm on the table, holding an exercise book in his hand. It was right above Xie Yu\u2019s face and blocked the light shining in from the window.Xie Yu slept soundly and wasn\u2019t aware in the slightest that someone was blocking the sun for him.\u201cAh, is there another deskmate as good as me in the world?\u201d He Zhao\u2019s arm was sore so he switched to the other arm, murmuring as he did so, \u201c\u2026Even I\u2019m touched by what I\u2019m doing.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He had moved himself, but he hadn\u2019t moved the math teacher.The math teacher corrected about half the homework, then asked the class rep to retrieve the set square from Class 5 so he could use it in class later. As he looked up he saw He Zhao using his workbook to shield his deskmate from the sun.He put down the red pen. He didn\u2019t alert them directly; instead, he calmly watched them for a while. Other students noticed something wasn\u2019t right and followed his gaze.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThis really was a scene full of love for a classmate.So touching, it moved the sky and earth.He Zhao considered switching the workbook for the textbook in order to provide more shade. While he deliberated, a tiny piece of white chalk flew from the podium and hit his head with perfect accuracy.The chalk bounced off, landed on the ground, and leisurely rolled to a halt by the wastepaper bin.The math teacher wasn\u2019t sure whether to be mad or to laugh. \u201cThe two of you in the last row, do you think I don\u2019t exist?\u201dOn hearing this, He Zhao\u2019s hand slipped. The exercise book fell and landed right on Xie Yu\u2019s face.Xie Yu was jolted awake.He had only just fallen asleep and his mind was still foggy so soon after being woken up. He forgot that he was attending morning self-study. Without even opening his eyes, he cursed at He Zhao, \u201cDo you want to die?\u201dAnother piece of chalk came flying in their direction.Wu Zheng had taught for nearly ten years and his chalk-throwing skills were honed to perfection. Students who shirked class or fell asleep were all awakened this way.Every throw was perfectly accurate.The effect was prominent, and it saved him time in class.Xie Yu got hit twice before he figured out what was going on.He Zhao dodged as he said, \u201cMr. Wu, I think we should all calm down\u2026\u201dCalm down, my ass. Wu Zheng nearly cursed out loud but he tamped it down through sheer will. He didn\u2019t intend to keep talking nonsense with them and pointed at the doorway. \u201cGet out. You both get out and calm down. You want to calm down, right? Calm down nice and good.\u201dIt was early in the morning, and Xie Yu hadn\u2019t gotten enough sleep. He and He Zhao leaned against the window outside Class 2.3.The first class period was also math. Wu Zheng\u2019s temper was slow to cool and he made them wait until the class bell rang before they could return to their seats when the class bell rang. So, in between self-study and first period, they stood by the doorway like bellhops.In the corridor, people came and went.\u201cWhile I can still control myself,\u201d Xie Yu said, \u201cYou\u2019d better explain this.\u201dHe Zhao: \u201cI\u2019m afraid that if I say it you\u2019ll be too moved.\u201dXie Yu really wasn\u2019t in a good mood. Since a young age, the philosophy he had cultivated was to avoid talking to idiots, and to just grab them and beat them up instead. He endured, then endured some more, then decided to give He Zhao one last chance. \u201cAre you explaining or not?\u201dHe Zhao hadn\u2019t even the chance to speak before Wan Da stuck his head out the window and tilted it. He said, \u201cWhat a touching story with a tragic ending. Very impressive, Zhao-ge. You even blocked the sun for Yu-ge, but in the end, this poignant gesture touched only you alone.\u201dHe Zhao: \u201cDa Da, how can you say that? You can\u2019t say that.\u201dWan Da: \u201cNo\u2014look at Yu-ge\u2019s expression. I think Yu-ge really wants to take your head off and use it as a soccer ball right now.\u201dHe Zhao confidently said, \u201cNot possible. Although my deskmate seems heartless, I believe he\u2019s really very kind.\u201dXie Yu understood the gist of what happened via Wan Da\u2019s rambling. He exhaled slowly, rolled up his sleeves to reveal half his forearms, then grabbed He Zhao\u2019s collar and dragged him towards the toilets.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d He Zhao was rather cooperative and followed Xie Yu some of the way. \u201cAsking big bro on a date to the bathroom?\u201d\u201cFinding a different place to beat you up.\u201dWan Da was overcome with joy. He leaned against the window and laughed out loud for a long time.Shen Jie was walking toward them from the far end of the corridor. He felt in his pocket for a cigarette, preparing to hide in the bathroom for a smoke. He stopped as he passed Class 2.3 out of habit to say hi to his Zhao-ge. Glancing in, he saw that He Zhao\u2019s seat was empty.He leaned close to Wan Da and asked, \u201cWhat are you laughing about? Where is Zhao-ge?\u201dWan Da explained the situation to Shen Jie, whose desire for a smoke had vanished. \u201cDamn it, I\u2019m going over there to watch.\u201dXie Yu had said he was going to beat He Zhao up, but he was just posturing and didn\u2019t really show his skills.They turned back before they even reached the bathroom door.\u201cAll right, all right, I surrender.\u201d He Zhao threw an arm around Xie Yu from behind, pushing him ahead. He cajoled, as if he were speaking to a child, \u201cLet\u2019s not fuss any more.\u201dXie Yu wasn\u2019t really angry.When Wan Da had said, \u201cblock the sun,\u201d Xie Yu had been stunned for several seconds.Then something strange had happened in his head. A strange feeling had emerged, and he grew more and more frustrated the more he thought about it. He became so frustrated that only one simple solution remained in his mind.\u2026Beat the person who caused it.Shen Jie grew more worried the more he looked. \u201cWhat the hell are they doing?\u201dHe Zhao didn\u2019t resort to violence easily, but his skills were still very good. Shen Jie had initially thought he would get to witness a showdown between the \u2018big bro of the year\u2019 and the \u2018old big bro,\u2019 something with a coolness factor so high it emitted its own special aura.Wan Da, in recent days, had accepted that these two had a bromance so strong it shut out any other friends, and now he spat out another word: \u201c\u2026Flirting?!\u201dShen Jie: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThere were eight class periods today and all of them were going over their respective chapter tests, solidifying the class content that had been taught over the last month in preparation for the monthly tests, which would begin next Monday.Extremely boring.He Zhao lowered his head to look at his phone. When both it and his power bank ran out of power, he took a break and folded origami.After he folded one, he tossed it on Xie Yu\u2019s desk.He made a lot of things: roses, little jumping frogs, and everything else he could think of.\u201cMy side of the desk isn\u2019t a rubbish dump,\u201d Xie Yu reminded him.He Zhao didn\u2019t say anything and continued to fold paper with his head bowed.Xie Yu swept all the origami he threw over to the side.He had to pretend he wasn\u2019t listening, while simultaneously dividing his attention between his phone game and the long problem question the teacher was explaining. He had no attention to waste on He Zhao.He Zhao was also very attentively folding origami. He held a piece of paper about the size of a post-it between his fingers, folding it back and forth.Compared to the things he folded, his slender, fine-boned fingers were better eye candy.\u201cSo with the rules we established just now, we can eliminate one of the answers. Do you know which one?\u201d Wu Zheng held a long ruler in his hand. Every time he touched it to the board it made out a loud clack. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t understand it, then just give up. This question is beyond what\u2019s covered in the syllabus, so you actually don\u2019t have to do it\u2026\u201dNone of the students were speaking. This type of complicated question, which required comparatively more effort than the results it produced, wasn\u2019t interesting.Only Xue Xisheng raised his hand. \u201cTeacher, which one do we eliminate? I still don\u2019t really get it.\u201d\u201cCome to the office after class and I\u2019ll explain it,\u201d Wu Zheng explained. \u201cThat\u2019s all for this mock exam. Correct your answers, and class rep, collect the papers before the end of the day.\u201dThe class bell rang as Wu Zheng finished speaking.\u201cHey.\u201d He Zhao drew close to Xie Yu and spoke in his ear.Xie Yu was looking down at his phone, deleting from his notes app one of the two answers he had narrowed it down to. He deleted \u2018negative one\u2019 and kept \u2018zero.\u2019 \u201cWhat do you want?\u201dThe next period was gym. He Zhao was still injured and couldn\u2019t play any sports yet, but breathing in the fresh air at the basketball courts was still something he looked forward to. It was better than staying in the classroom, anyway.Xie Yu didn\u2019t intend to go. He hadn\u2019t slept well recently and was prepared to go back to the dorm to sleep.\u201cYou\u2019re really not going?\u201d He Zhao asked.Xie Yu turned off his phone and reflexively concluded the conversation. \u201cWhat business is it of yours?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the fun in staying in the dorm? Is there anyone as suave as your Zhao-ge to keep you company?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe instigator of the entire sequence of unfortunate events really still dared to speak.The night he and He Zhao did the English paper, they had stayed up till two or three in the morning.When Xie Yu prepared to leave, He Zhao did everything he could think of to make him stay. He even said he\u2019d let Xie Yu take the bed and claimed he\u2019d sleep on the floor. In the end, he had still crept into the bed to sleep.It was 4 a.m. by the time they went to bed. If not, with how light a sleeper Xie Yu typically was, He Zhao wouldn\u2019t have successfully crawled into the bed.Wan Da and the others grabbed their gym clothes, waiting for He Zhao so they could go downstairs together. \u201cZhao-ge, are you coming? I can\u2019t hold back any longer. I think I\u2019m in top form today.\u201dHe Zhao stood up, about to go to the basketball court. As he left, he bent and stuck his hand in front of Xie Yu, a messily folded paper crane in his palm. \u201cFor you.\u201dReally ugly.And loose and crumpled at that.Xie Yu picked up the crooked-necked paper crane by the wing, and the crane came apart at his touch. \u201c\u2026What the hell is this.\u201dSince it was falling apart, Xie Yu just took it apart and flattened it into a piece of paper. He was about to shove it into He Zhao\u2019s math book when he noticed the other side of the paper had a very messy circle in black ink on it.When He Zhao came back from gym class, his mood was worse than when he had left. He stuck his hands in his pocket and strolled lazily into class.Wan Da, on the other hand, was very excited. The moment he entered the room, he went to the podium and said loudly, \u201cFriends staying for evening self-study tonight, I have an announcement to make. I just came up with an excellent idea for a thrilling and joyous weekend!\u201dHe Zhao returned to his seat, sat down, and didn\u2019t say anything.Wan Da felt like no one was listening to him and looked a little embarrassed. He turned to look at the last row and pleaded for help: \u201cZhao-ge, won\u2019t you applaud for me?\u201dOnly now did He Zhao take his hands out and clap faintly a couple times. \u201cWell said. Well said.\u201dSomething was off about He Zhao. Xie Yu tilted his head to the side and asked, \u201cWhat are you up to now?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u201d He Zhao didn\u2019t want to say it.\u201cGhost-hunting.\u201d\u201c\uff1f\u201dHe Zhao scratched his head. \u201cWan Da said he\u2019d get everyone together on the weekend to go ghost-hunting. For the ghost that\u2019s been going up and down the dorm building and knocking on doors.\u201dWan Da had read a supernatural novel underneath his covers last night. The story followed several students who went to an abandoned building and the ensuing adventures. The plot was very exciting, the characters died one by one, and he couldn\u2019t stop reading no matter how hard he tried.As he read, he came up with a daring idea.The more he thought about it, the more thrilling he found it.Xie Yu felt that these idiotic thoughts were certainly the sort Wan Da and the others would come up with.And Wan Da still said it would be both thrilling and joyous\u2026\u2026He Zhao was currently worrying. After a second, Xie Yu suddenly said, \u201cThen, be quick.\u201d\u201cBe quick to what?\u201d\u201cQuickly read the Complete Guide to Exorcism again.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dXie Yu thought about the book he had seen and couldn\u2019t hold back his laughter. The moment he started, he couldn\u2019t stop. \u201cReview a little. Maybe you\u2019ll find a use for it.\u201dHe Zhao: \u201c\u2026Fuck, are you really\u2014\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Do you want to add some color to your bland weekend life? What on earth is going on in the dormitory building? Aren\u2019t any of you curious at all? Shouldn\u2019t people, being alive, rise to the challenge and confront the unknown? Come on, can someone answer me? I feel like I\u2019ve been left out in the cold.\u201dXie Yu looked at the stragglers left in the classroom. Aside from himself, He Zhao, and Wan Da, there were only two boys who didn\u2019t talk a lot in class.Throughout the spiel, Xue Xisheng hadn\u2019t looked up at all, as if he hadn\u2019t heard anything.He was still wrestling with an especially difficult question. He was completely immersed only in studying, and nothing around him could draw his concern.The other boy was Ding Lianghua. When he answered questions, he sounded like a mosquito. His personality was quiet and he seemed especially timid. Wan Da had heard that Ding Linghua had a mild social disorder, but he didn\u2019t know if the rumor was true.Only Xu Qingqing responded to let him down gently. \u201cLittle bro Da, although big sis is very interested\u2026 it\u2019s pointless. It\u2019s the boys\u2019 dorm.\u201dWan Da: \u201cSo what if it\u2019s the boys\u2019 dorm? As long as you\u2019re willing, you can be my big bro Qing anytime.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Xu Qingqing tossed an eraser at him. \u201cGo and die.\u201dWan Da felt that reality was too far from his ideal. The ghostbusting team he had envisioned wasn\u2019t like this.He hadn\u2019t the courage to bother Xue Xisheng so he could only go and bug Ding Lianghua.He sat in front of Ding Lianghua and noticed Ding Lianghua shudder.Wan Da scooted forward and Ding Lianghua dodged backward. \u201cBro, what do you think? I\u2019ll say again\u2014this is a man\u2019s quest.\u201dDing Lianghua: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dDing Lianghua wasn\u2019t great at communicating with others, and after listening to him hemming and hawing for a long time, Wan Da still wasn\u2019t sure if he was going or not. It took a lot of effort to hold this conversation.Xie Yu was shooting the breeze with Zhou Dalei.Dalei sent him a photo of a fat orange cat and a kitten. The little fellow was adorable, with a coat of fine soft fur, and the two cats looked into the camera with identically tilted heads.The background was Dalei\u2019s home balcony.Zhou Dalei: Didn\u2019t see her for a few weeks and she went to give birth! He looks exactly like Fatty. I\u2019m calling him Tubby!Xie Yu smiled and hit save.The fat orange cat was the communal pet of Black Water Street, her origins a mystery.She hadn\u2019t been that fat when she first arrived. She had been skinny, her bones jutting out in hills and valleys against her skin. She must have been a stray for a long time; she hid when she saw anyone and no one knew where she usually slept.Many dogs and cats passed through Black Water Street. Aunt Mei and Aunt Lei often gathered their leftovers, including fish bones if there were any, put them into steel bowls they didn\u2019t often use, and left them by their doors.Time passed, and the orange cat made her home in Black Water Street.This orange cat had personality. She didn\u2019t eat white rice. If she ate dinner at someone\u2019s house, she\u2019d stay the night and catch mice for that household. She was very thorough about catching them and even brought the mouse corpses to the doorway and arranged them in a neat row.Zhou Dalei: My mom\u2019s put down blood money. She cooked a fish specially for her and said that for the few weeks she wasn\u2019t here, the house felt unclean\u2026 Aunt Wang from next door cooked one too. One of them made steamed fish and the other made barbecue, like they\u2019re competing for who keeps Fatty tonight.Xie Yu: You should reflect. Why is a cat\u2019s life better than yours?Zhou Dalei: \u2026\u2026Wan Da hovered around Ding Lianghua for a long time. Maybe because he found Wan Da annoying, Ding Lianghua finally nodded.He Zhao was still thinking of escape routes. A dozen-odd excuses flashed through his mind in minutes, and when he learned that Ding Lianghua was going to be there, he said, \u201cThat guy? That guy who stutters when he has to say anything in class?\u201dXie Yu didn\u2019t have much of an impression of Ding Lianghua and didn\u2019t say anything.\u201cEven he\u2019s going.\u201d He Zhao tossed aside his phone, kicked back in his chair, and felt his fighting spirit suddenly rise.Xie Yu thought: Don\u2019t think so little of him. I think he might be stronger than you.When Wan Da walked to the last row to invite the two big bros, He Zhao slapped the desk. \u201cA man\u2019s quest! Whoever doesn\u2019t go isn\u2019t a man. No need to worry. Zhao-ge will protect you.\u201dWan Da: \u201cZhao-ge, from today on, you and me are blood brothers. So suave! Really a man among men.\u201dXie Yu immediately sneered.The four arranged to meet that evening in He Zhao\u2019s dorm room to wait for the knocking to start after midnight.Xie Yu lived close to He Zhao and wasn\u2019t in a hurry. He planned to do another mock exam, but after showering he received several calls from He Zhao loudly asking him to come over.Xie Yu was still drying his hair, still dripping with water. \u201cYou\u2019re so annoying.\u201dHe Zhao said: \u201cCome over quickly. Got a big treasure to show you.\u201dThis person was really annoying.Xie Yu slung his towel around his neck and crossed the corridor. He pushed open the door and said, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\u201cAlmost done.\u201d He Zhao was writing something and didn\u2019t even turn his head. His movements were expansive. His handwriting was already bad and in combination with his exaggerated gestures, it was completely illegible.Xie Yu drew closer and saw a long strip of paper on the desk, on which was written something curly and formless. In the center was a yin-yang symbol.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dXie Yu could guess what was happening. The hand drying his hair suddenly stilled. \u201cThis is\u2026\u201d\u201cComplete Guide to Exorcism\u2019s most powerful tactic. Ghost Seal,\u201d He Zhao said.Xie Yu\u2019s hair was wet and he wore only a simple T-shirt. His hand was rubbing a towel over his head. Looking at him, He Zhao mysteriously felt that Xie Yu\u2019s eyes also seemed to be veiled in pools of still water: shining, and quite soft, but cold.Xie Yu looked at the Ghost Seal for a long time and said, \u201cAh, you\u2019re really awesome.\u201dWan Da was the third person to arrive. He had changed into pajamas with a Spongebob Squarepants pattern. He carried a bag and held a flashlight in his hand.\u201cZhao-ge, I\u2019m here. Wah, Yu-ge, you\u2019re here early.\u201d Wan Da pushed open the door and entered. \u201cI brought a flashlight. If you have one, you should bring it, too. If the ghost is powerful, it might knock out all the lights in the building.\u201dXie Yu expressed his suspicion of this classic scene from a supernatural novel. \u201cWhat makes you think a flashlight won\u2019t be affected?\u201dWan Da: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d In the moment, he wasn\u2019t sure what to say.It was still early. The three of them, bored, got together to play a fighting video game.There was only one chair in the room, so the only other place to sit was the bed. Wan Da didn\u2019t dare touch He Zhao\u2019s bed, so he turned his gaze to Xie Yu. \u201cYu-ge, do you want to get up? I\u2026 I want to sit on the chair.\u201dWan Da very quickly discovered how awful it was to play video games with these two.Xie Yu seemed to have the ability to pick out an ace within three draws. He did as he pleased and didn\u2019t bother with his teammates at all. He Zhao ignored Wan Da, too. \u201cI\u2019ve got something good here. Old Xie, come over! Where are you? Come and get it.\u201d\u201cZhao-ge, I, I\u2019m your teammate too,\u201d Wan Da said, wanting to cry. \u201cThrow me a bone! I\u2019m so poor.\u201dOnly then did He Zhao look at Wan Da and give his teammate some attention. But after he looked at him, he said, \u201cYou\u2019re too far away. Just do your best.\u201dWan Da: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dDing Lianghua only arrived when it was close to 11 o\u2019clock.\u201cThought you weren\u2019t coming. Sit down.\u201d He Zhao scooted over and patted the bed.Ding Lianghua hadn\u2019t interacted with He Zhao much, and now he stood in the doorway helplessly. Reflexively, he glanced at Wan Da, who realized what was happening and offered half his chair. \u201cYou want to sit on the chair, too? Come here.\u201dDing Lianghua sat down carefully.He Zhao couldn\u2019t figure it out. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with the two of you?\u201dXie Yu\u2019s hair was more or less dry. He took the towel off and left it on He Zhao\u2019s desk.\u201cThen let\u2019s make our battle plan for tonight,\u201d Wan Da said excitedly. \u201cCome to think of it, Yu-ge, you pleasantly surprised me. I thought you wouldn\u2019t come\u2026\u201d After all, he was so asocial.\u201cI\u2019m here to see the show,\u201d Xie Yu said.12:30 a.m.It was pitch black outside the window and the dorm building was surprisingly silent.Over the weekend, more than half the building\u2019s occupants had left. Even the sound of one\u2019s footsteps seemed to be louder than usual. Looking from one end of the corridor to the other to see the seemingly endless stretch of doors, one might even get dizzy.Wan Da slowed his breathing and took the lead. He pushed open the door and walked out.Creak.In this atmosphere, even the sound of the door opening seemed creepy.He Zhao froze for a long moment, not moving.\u201cLet\u2019s go, Zhao-ge, what are you doing?\u201d Wan Da turned back and said.Xie Yu was behind He Zhao, who was blocking the way, so Xie Yu couldn\u2019t get out. He tapped his shoulder: \u201cProtect me\u2026 Zhao-ge. You\u2019re a man among men.\u201dHe Zhao: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe Zhao was very competent tonight. Maybe it was the Ghost Seal that brought him courage. After about half an hour of waiting, they grew bored and started chatting.\u201cDing Hualiang, you\u2026\u201d\u201cHis name is Ding Lianghua.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cSorry, I don\u2019t really remember much about you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cBut I\u2019ll bet that Old Xie doesn\u2019t even know your last name is Ding.\u201dWith a smile, Wan Da asked Xie Yu whether he was only pretending to not know, giving him a way out of the awkward situation He Zhao had put him in. Then the faint sound of knocking came to his ear.Everybody fell silent.Just when Wan Da said, \u201cMaybe we imagined it,\u201d there was another thunk.It sounded very far away.Muted, like there was something in between them and the source of the noise. The sound traveled through the empty corridor and up the stairwell.\u201cTonight, it\u2019s not knocking on the third floor,\u201d Wan Da said with a tremor in his voice. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s right below us.\u201dA long time from now, when Xie Yu reminisced about his high school life, he certainly wouldn\u2019t forget tonight. The subsequent series of idiotic happenings and the dumb ending are secondary.This giant idiot, who was so scared his hands were trembling, had stuffed the seal into his neighbor\u2019s hand regardless.He Zhao took the Ghost Seal with its messy scribbles and stuffed it into Xie Yu\u2019s hand. The paper was already wrinkled and held lingering traces of the warmth from his hand. He Zhao was currently staring nervously in the direction of the stairs, and had done everything subconsciously. He patted Xie Yu\u2019s head. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid. Big bro will protect you.\u201dXie Yu looked down at the piece of paper and was a little stunned.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There was a vaguely human shape slowly moving towards them, but its limbs couldn\u2019t be discerned.\u2018Its\u2019 footsteps were very light, like the scene was being played back in slow motion.Only the moonlight and the streetlights that shone in from the window shed some faint illumination onto this mysterious scene.Xie Yu clenched his hand around the Ghost Seal. He suddenly wanted to comfort this giant idiot next to him. He was about to say, \u201cYou don\u2019t really fucking think that someone wearing a bedspread and moving around is something supernatural, do you?\u201dBut he saw He Zhao pull another piece of paper from his pocket; the sigils and yin-yang symbol were nearly identical to the one in Xie Yu\u2019s hand. He Zhao looked remarkably calm: \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I have one more.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cNow what?!\u201d Wan Da asked.He Zhao retorted, \u201cYou made so many battle plans. Didn\u2019t you think of this scenario?\u201dWan Da lowered his voice: \u201cActually, I didn\u2019t think we\u2019d really meet it\u2026\u201dXie Yu leaned against the wall and said, \u201c\u2026What else can we do? Shall we go up and say hello?\u201dWan Da was silent.\u201cActually, I think that for a man\u2019s quest we need to be braver.\u201d Wan Da began speaking, then his attitude made a 180 degree turn. \u201cShall we go back and\u2026\u201d And sleep.Before he could finish speaking, Ding Lianghua, who had been silent the entire time, shot out from beside them!Ding Lianghua\u2019s time for the 100m sprint must have been great. During the next sports meet, they must get him to participate. He ran like a whirlwind. He even remembered to grab the fire extinguisher standing in the corner as he passed it and brought it down on the blob of something with a thunk.Wan Da: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe Zhao:\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dXie Yu:\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat is going on?\u201d\u201cAre your school dorm lives so exciting?\u201d\u201cA rich nightlife, certainly.\u201dMonday morning, when Shen Jie set foot into the classroom, he hadn\u2019t even put down his schoolbag before he heard the strange rumors. He turned in his work, not even bothering to revise, and ran straight to class 3.He leaned in through the window and stuck his head in. \u201cI heard Mad Dog almost exploded from rage. What on earth did you do?\u201dThe students were currently moving their desks around and the atmosphere was rowdy. Xu Qingwing had finished moving her own desk and was helping the others alongside Liu Cunhao: \u201cLuo Wenqiang, you go behind Wan Da, and then your row should line up with this side\u2026 there are 32 people taking the exams in our classroom. If there aren\u2019t enough tables and chairs, go borrow from the class next door.\u201dThey had to pull their desks apart and arrange them into the examination regulation format: single seats.Later, when the bell rang, they\u2019d have to go to their separate examination venues to take the test: this was the first formal exam period of the first semester of year 2.The monthly exams.Wan Da attentively positioned the desks and chairs. He didn\u2019t really want to answer Shen Jie: \u201cThis\u2026 come to speak of it, it\u2019s hard to explain in one sitting.\u201dShen Jie: \u201cXiao Wan, are you really still the Know-It-All I first met, who gossips even when passing notes and giving answers to me?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWan Da shook his head and said, \u201cPeople grow up, don\u2019t they?\u201dShen Jie\u2019s grades weren\u2019t good. In his first year, there was one end-of-semester exam where he really wanted to get a good grade so that he could go home and pass the New Year happily without his family\u2019s nagging. Before the exam invigilator came around, he\u2019d knocked on the shoulder of the person in front of him and said, \u201cFriend, do you want to have a good New Year?\u201dThe guy in front just happened to be Wan Da.The two hit it off instantly.At first, they only passed answers. After two or three rounds, Shen Jie used his arm to knock his eraser to the floor, then picked up the little note on the ground as he bent to pick up the eraser. Aside from the answer, there was an additional line: You\u2019re from Class 5? Do you know He Zhao? I heard that he fought with a teacher a few days ago?By the end, the note passing had become a huge gossip session.They hadn\u2019t copied that many answers, but the contents of their chats covered pretty much the entire year\u2019s students.So Shen Jie turned his eyes towards He Zhao.His eyes swept the room once and finally locked onto their target.He Zhao and Xie Yu\u2019s desks were divided rather awkwardly; they went to whichever row still needed bodies.He Zhao was in the last seat in the innermost row.The lighting in the corner wasn\u2019t very good. He Zhao\u2019s back was to the wall, one hand in his pocket; his whole manner was leisurely as he played with his phone.\u201cZhao-ge\u2014\u201d Shen Jie raised a hand and shouted.He Zhao heard his name and looked up. He took the plastic bag on the desk and tossed it in the garbage as he walked over. \u201cExam\u2019s about to start. What are you messing about for?\u201dShen Jie: \u201cYour dorm building\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll summarize it in three words for you. A man\u2019s quest,\u201d He Zhao said.Shen Jie wore an expression of total confusion.Xie Yu was sitting right there, and he was currently lying on the desk, sleeping. He Zhao patted the back of his head and said, \u201cRight, Old Xie?\u201dXie Yu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe didn\u2019t even lift his head. He fumbled about to one side, grabbed something, and threw it.It was a calculator. He Zhao feared it\u2019d break if it hit the floor, so he took two steps backward and caught it. \u201cLittle friend, your temper\u2019s pretty hot today.\u201dShen Jie didn\u2019t want to ask any more.He Zhao cut his thoughts off. \u201cTell you later. Scram back to your own classroom. The exam\u2019s about to start.\u201dBefore, the exam seating charts had been computer-generated and the students couldn\u2019t tell who\u2019d be taking the exam in the same classroom as them. This semester, they changed the setup and arranged the seating chart according to the end-of-semester exam scores. The top 30 were in one classroom, the next 30 in the second classroom, and so on.Perhaps they were trying to divide the students into classes this way in order to arouse their fighting spirit. One must always look ahead. Likewise, one must always strive towards the higher examination venues.Dean Jiang\u2019s original words: \u201cYou must have ambition! To be ambitious while studying is nothing to be ashamed of. For example, if I was taking the exam in division 5 today, the next time, I want to be sitting in division 1 taking the exam! I hope that all of you will have that kind of fighting spirit!\u201dShen Jie very reluctantly left.Wan Da cautiously came over. \u201cThe study rep isn\u2019t coming to take the test?\u201dHe Zhao: \u201cHe\u2019s already like that\u2026 can he still take the test?\u201d\u201cHeard his mom came to bring him home to sleep. Sleep deprivation. Every day he only slept two or three hours. No wonder he had a breakdown.\u201dHearing the two words \u2018study rep,\u2019 Xie Yu\u2019s sleepiness fled, too. The sound of chairs being dragged reverberated through the classroom, and it was very noisy. He sat up and glanced toward Xue Xisheng\u2019s seat.That night, Ding Lianghua had rushed out with incomparable bravery. The fire extinguisher had sprayed out dry powder, covering the entire corridor. When they dragged the blanket off the \u2018ghost,\u2019 they saw Xue Xisheng lying quietly on the ground.\u201cWho would\u2019ve thought it was sleepwalking,\u201d Wan Da said. \u201cThis is the first time I met someone who sleepwalks that far. If the school dorm didn\u2019t lock its front doors, would he wander outside the school with his eyes closed?\u201dThe commotion they\u2019d made in the middle of the night had disturbed Mad Dog and Old Tang who lived in the faculty dormitory next door. The two had rushed over in a hurry, and one of them hadn\u2019t even pulled up the zipper on his pants. Old Tang even wore his slippers on the wrong feet. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening? What\u2019s all this noise in the middle of the night? What on earth are you doing?\u201dThe preparation bell for the exams rang, and everyone brought their examination materials to their respective classrooms.Xie Yu hadn\u2019t brought anything but a black pen.If he could, he wouldn\u2019t even have brought the pen. He really didn\u2019t know how else he would surpass He Zhao. Even if he shut his eyes and did the questions blind he\u2019d score higher than this guy.\u201cWe have to fill in scantrons, you need a 2B.\u201d He Zhao was walking behind Xie Yu and stuffed a pencil into his hand, even sharing his own experiences. \u201cEven though it doesn\u2019t make a difference if you shade or not, you can at least get a few random points.\u201d\u201cA few?\u201d\u201cSeven or eight.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dBefore, when Xie Yu took exams, he\u2019d strictly control his answers to get an average grade. Although he always maintained low grades, he wouldn\u2019t make them too low, to avoid giving the impression that he was an idiot.He always scored within the range that let people think, \u201cThis kid\u2019s mind is quite sharp, but he refuses to study properly.\u201dEven Madam Gu thought that there was still hope for her child.Even though her child skipped class and his scores were among the lowest in the exam, that was all because he didn\u2019t pay attention in class. If he studied seriously, he certainly wouldn\u2019t get the grades he did now.Xie Yu took the green pencil. In order to calibrate his score a while from now, he asked He Zhao, \u201cWhat did you score at the end of last semester?\u201dThey had walked past classrooms 1 through 8 and still had to climb a flight of stairs to get to their exam venue, for the very last division. According to Dean Jiang\u2019s exam seating arrangement, this exam venue was the gathering place for students with bad grades.He Zhao: \u201cLast semester? Don\u2019t really remember. I think it was pretty good. I performed pretty well.\u201dXie Yu: \u201cMm?\u201dHe Zhao: \u201cEnglish I scored about\u2026 40 marks?\u201dXie Yu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe slackers\u2019 gathering place only contained about 20 people, each of them a character who posed a headache to their teachers. They really were something; with their own strength, they managed to drag their whole class\u2019s average down. One person\u2019s score could more or less determine their class\u2019s placement in the year.He Zhao walked in and several people waved to him: \u201cHi, Zhao-ge.\u201dHe Zhao glanced around the room and noticed many people he knew. He stood in the doorway, one hand stuck in his pocket, and looked like the big bro of the slackers. \u201cAh, long time no see.\u201dTang Sen was invigilating the slackers\u2019 classroom. He faced the computer, adjusting the watch on his wrist, and all the other teachers worried for him. \u201cOld Tang, your class average this time around probably won\u2019t be good.\u201d Mr. Tang had just transferred in, and if he didn\u2019t produce results\u2026\u201cAh?\u201d Tang Sen was still concentrating on adjusting his watch. \u201cNo problem, I\u2019m not worried about that. Exam scores aren\u2019t the measure of everything.\u201dConsidering this way of splitting seating arrangements, there really was one significant impact on these slackers\u2014there was no one good to copy answers from.Who they picked to copy answers from\u2026 it was six of one, half a dozen of the other.But there was still a difference between \u2018six of one\u2019 and \u2018half a dozen of the other.\u2019The first student in the first row\u2014that is, the guy in the slackers\u2019 exam hall who\u2019d gotten the highest score in last semester\u2019s exams\u2014had everyone\u2019s eyes on him.\u201cI heard you scored a 60 in the math exam. Wow, you can get 60 marks out of 150.\u201d\u201cWhat, a 60? Are you that good?\u201dThis was probably the first time in this bad student\u2019s life that he\u2019d experienced anything like this. He said with a little embarrassment: \u201cThat\u2026 no, not really.\u201dXie Yu rested his forehead on his palm, his head lowered, trying not to listen to this group of people talking.This was really too\u2026Xie Yu\u2019s thoughts made many complicated twists and turns and, for a moment, he couldn\u2019t find the right words to complain. Then he heard He Zhao, sitting behind him, also join the hot air contest: \u201c60 points, bro, that\u2019s really strong, bro.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Someone even shoved a cigarette into his breast pocket: \u201cBig bro, a little token of my regard. Please accept it and don\u2019t stand on ceremony.\u201d\u201c80 points for language! I\u2019ve only seen it in my dreams. How does someone with grades that good end up placed in this exam venue? You\u2019re really a buried talent. An ace among wastrels.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re really impressive. When I make eye contact later, throw me the answer.\u201d\u201cRelax. I\u2019ve walked the streets for a long time. Zero risk. I\u2019ll swallow the paper before I let it fall into the clutches of an invigilator.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe boy, surrounded on all sides, was on cloud nine. He thought to himself that he must get placed into this exam division again next time\u2026 the feeling of being a big bro was very nice.He felt his whole body charge with energy!No one had praised his failing grades like this before!Xie Yu sat in his seat, twirling a pen, and waited for the invigilator to enter the classroom.Three of his fingers were pressed around a black ink pen, twirling it negligently. Round and round. His eyes slipped slightly closed; he was getting tired of waiting.He Zhao tapped Xie Yu\u2019s right shoulder with a pen. \u201cLittle friend, want the answers?\u201dThe pen in Xie Yu\u2019s hand fell to the table with a clatter. His hand, with its long and narrow fingers and prominent joints, maintained its position without moving.\u201cYou?\u201d Xie Yu put one hand to his head and twisted his body to look back at He Zhao. \u201cForget it.\u201dHe Zhao knew that Xie Yu had misunderstood. He leaned back in his chair and held out one hand with a smile, his index finger crooked. He lightly tapped Xie Yu\u2019s forehead. \u201cWhat are you thinking? Not mine, of course. It\u2019s that guy\u2019s, the one who scored 60 in math and 80 in language\u2026\u201dIt really was a light tap, barely touching Xie Yu\u2019s forehead as it swiped across.Xie Yu was viscerally repulsed by this contact.\u2026 Instead of \u2018repulsed,\u2019 perhaps \u2018unused to\u2019 might be a more suitable descriptor. He braced one hand against the desk and stood up, body leaning forward, wanting very much to split He Zhao\u2019s damn head open. \u201cI told you before. Don\u2019t touch me.\u201dHe Zhao sat in the very last row, but his seat was still some distance from the wall. He moved back several paces, chair and all.\u201cYour temper\u2019s pretty hot,\u201d He Zhao said. \u201c\u2026All right, all right. I won\u2019t fuss any more. Calm down.\u201dTheir quarrel had caused a stir, and others were glancing towards their corner, not sure what they were doing. It didn\u2019t quite look like they were fighting.\u201cWhat are those two doing?\u201d\u201cI heard someone from Class 3 say that Xie Yu and Zhao-ge\u2026 the two of them are a little bent.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t really believe it at the time either\u2026\u201d\u201cWhich person from Class 3, Know-It-All? What he says is maybe half true at best. Just take it with a grain of salt.\u201dThe bell rang again.Dean Jiang\u2019s voice came from the intercom: \u201cStudents, the exam starts in five minutes. Please return to your designated exam room. The first exam will be language.\u201dUp to this point, the announcement had been very somber and delivered in a gentle tone, probably intended to soothe the students\u2019 exam anxieties. But Dean Jiang suddenly stopped halfway and his tone changed. His voice suddenly got much louder: \u201cStudent, which class are you from?! The exam is about to start and you\u2019re still messing around here? Stop right there! Get over here! You brat, stop running\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe announcement cut off halfway. An alert student heard the sound of high heels clacking in the corridor and warned everyone: \u201cShh. The invigilator is here.\u201dThe noisy classroom quieted in an instant.The word \u2018quiet\u2019 wasn\u2019t in He Zhao\u2019s vocabulary. He poked Xie Yu with the pen again: \u201cI\u2019ll pass the answers to you later.\u201dXie Yu calmly said, \u201cNo need.\u201d\u201cWhy not? 80 points for language.\u201dXie Yu thought, Want the answers, my ass. I might accidentally score higher than you.\u201cCan\u2019t accept it.\u201d Xie Yu found a reasonable excuse. \u201cHigh grades don\u2019t suit me.\u201dThe two invigilators were Tang Sen and Xu Xia.What a coincidence: both of them had ties to Class 2.3.Xu Xia was probably assigned to this classroom at the last minute. When she got to the door, she even asked, \u201cIs this the room?\u201dOld Tang replied, \u201cIt is.\u201d He held a cup of herbal tea with medicinal properties, the same as he always did. When he entered the classroom, he put down the cup, opened the sealed package of examination booklets, and started to count them.Xu Xia had brought a chair and a book. She glanced around the classroom. When she saw He Zhao, her face froze into an unnatural expression for a second before she averted her gaze.\u201cIt\u2019s Xu Xia.\u201d Someone recognized her.\u201cDon\u2019t know her. What\u2019s she like? A strict invigilator?\u201d\u201cShe was the homeroom teacher for Class 3 before. Then she was transferred\u2026 Ask Zhao-ge. He probably knows more.\u201d\u201cZhao-ge, Zhao-ge.\u201dSomeone sitting close to Zhao-ge really dropped his voice and asked. After all, how strict these two invigilators were was directly correlated to their fates. \u201cOld Tang, I know him. But this lady teacher, is she strict?\u201dHe Zhao smiled and tossed his pen on the table. \u201cShe\u2026\u201dHe Zhao didn\u2019t continue.That guy rubbed his head, not understanding. But he did think He Zhao\u2019s smile seemed a little cold.Regardless of whether the invigilators were strict or not, the requisite cheating still had to be carried out.This lot didn\u2019t have respectable grades, but they all had a lot of courage and played for the thrill of the game. When the time was right, they wouldn\u2019t hesitate.The action in this room really resembled that of a blockbuster movie.\u201cHalf an hour left to the end of the exam. Use it well and answer the questions. If you haven\u2019t started on the essay, you need to manage your time better.\u201dXu Xia made several rounds of the classroom, then stopped walking, sat down, and started reading her book. Tang Sen held his cup and walked around the room. \u201cPay attention. In school, we learn more than knowledge. More than doing questions, it\u2019s more important to learn how to live properly\u2026\u201dAs Tang Sen spoke, he turned around, and a balled-up piece of paper flew across the room behind him.\u201cI hope none of you will cheat. Show your true ability. If you don\u2019t know the answer, that\u2019s fine. It\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of\u2026 as long as you work hard to learn it in future, that\u2019s fine\u2026\u201dThe wadded-up paper hit the corner of He Zhao\u2019s desk perfectly.No matter what subject He Zhao was studying, he followed his principle of \u2018Give up and go to the next question\u2019\u2014with the exception of language. With language, at least he understood the question; he wasn\u2019t illiterate, after all. So, during language exams, he always completely filled the answer booklet to make up for his regrets of not being able to do anything in his other subjects.He finished the questions in front and started on the essay question. He wrote with overflowing passion and his writing was so messy even the grid couldn\u2019t contain it.Seeing that Tang Sen was about to turn around again, He Zhao calmly reached out and took the wad of paper.Tang Sen did indeed turn around. He stared at He Zhao\u2019s exam booklet for a long time with a complicated expression, but didn\u2019t say anything in the end. He held both hands together behind his back and walked off, muttering as he went: \u201c\u2026basic requirement is legible writing. These are the points you really shouldn\u2019t lose. Please, pay attention to that.\u201dMore than twenty people all shared the same set of answers. They had discussed it for a long time and finally decided on a pipeline model of passing answers: the answers would move from the front of the first vertical row to the end, and then from the end of the second vertical row back to the front.The classmate who passed the answer to He Zhao motioned to him to finish copying and pass it along.He Zhao leisurely made an \u2018OK\u2019 handsign to reassure him.Xie Yu planned to score about 40 or 50 points in this language exam. He had left half the booklet empty; for the questions he didn\u2019t intend to get points for, he simply didn\u2019t write the answers in.He Zhao\u2019s incredible ability to blindly answer questions with his eyes wide open\u2014he really couldn\u2019t do it.In the language class before the exam, Old Tang had handed out two reading comprehension mock exams to be collected at the end of class. Xie Yu had watched He Zhao attentively answer the questions, but all his answers didn\u2019t make sense. His answer sheet had been passed around the class and became the laughingstock of Liu Cunhao and the others who surrounded it and treated it as a big joke.This time, the essay topic was \u2018SilhouetteBackground.\u2019Xie Yu was doing his best to stray from the topic, and thinking about how to do it made his head hurt. Now he heard He Zhao calling him softly from behind.Then he felt something tap his back twice.\u201cOld Xie,\u201d He Zhao whispered. \u201cHand. Underneath.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThe answers. Give me your hand.\u201dHe Zhao held the wadded paper in one hand and leaned forward, his left hand under the desk. Very subtle. If Xie Yu reached back, he\u2019d be able to grab it.Xie Yu calmly nudged his chair back. He held the edge of his desk with one hand and closed the distance between them, lowering his voice: \u201cI said, I don\u2019t want it.\u201d\u201cEven if you don\u2019t want it, the guys in front are waiting.\u201d He Zhao tapped the underside of the desk with one finger and urged, \u201cTheir fates are in your hands. Do a good deed today. Build your karma.\u201dThe big fan suspended from the center of the ceiling creaked as it turned, covering the sounds of their conversation. A breeze, slightly warm, swept in from the open window. It was very quiet in the classroom and there were several extra exam booklets on the podium, weighted down with a box of chalk. The corners of the pages lifted in the breeze, and the booklets looked as if they\u2019d fly away any second.Xie Yu reluctantly lowered his arm and reached backwards, but after feeling around for a while, he didn\u2019t find anything.\u201cWhere?\u201d\u201cUnder here.\u201d\u201cNot there.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s there. Feel around a bit.\u201dXie Yu wanted to discover his adversary\u2019s secrets and as he felt around he asked, \u201cDid you copy them?\u201d\u201cMe? I didn\u2019t copy them.\u201d As He Zhao spoke he remembered Xie Yu\u2019s, \u201cCan\u2019t accept it,\u201d and continued, \u201c\u2026I thought about it, and I can\u2019t accept it either.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dXie Yu was frustrated beyond bearing. He leaned back another few degrees, thinking that if he didn\u2019t manage to get it this time, he\u2019d just forget it. Leave the others to their fates; what did he need to copy? If he didn\u2019t know, he\u2019d leave it blank\u2026 as he thought this, he caught He Zhao\u2019s fingertip.Both of them froze.The fan creaked as it turned.The chalk box held only several stubs of chalk and it couldn\u2019t hold the exam booklets on the podium any longer. The wind swept them away and Xu Xia hurriedly closed her book to pick them up.Xie Yu didn\u2019t let go. He Zhao didn\u2019t retract his hand, either.After several moments with both of them at a standstill, He Zhao moved his hand. He crooked his index finger up slightly, in just the right position to touch Xie Yu\u2019s palm.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The listening section of the English exam later will be affected.\u201dTang Sen nodded and walked over to turn off the fan.Xu Xia held the booklets in her hands. If she were to only lower her head slightly she would be able to see the underside of He Zhao\u2019s desk.Seeing Xu Xia about to stand up, Xie Yu snatched his hand back like he\u2019d been electrocuted.He Zhao reacted more slowly. He watched Xie Yu look down and continue to answer questions, then blinked and closed his hand, once again enfolding the wad of paper within his fingers.Xu Xia didn\u2019t notice anything unusual.After picking up the papers, she glanced around, then opened her book and kept reading.Tang Sen noticed a student flipping through their book, trying to find the right word to fill in the blank. He stopped by the student\u2019s desk and, without saying a word, rapped the desk in warning.The fan slowed to a stop.There were four people in front of Xie Yu and all of them were anxious. The answers hadn\u2019t reached them yet. If they weren\u2019t passed on, they wouldn\u2019t have time to copy them.The one at the head of the row finally couldn\u2019t help himself and turned back to ask the student behind him, \u201c\u2026Where are the goods?\u201dThe latter indicated he didn\u2019t know and turned back, too. \u201cIs it still with Zhao-ge? When will it get here?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cHurry him up. We can\u2019t wait anymore. There\u2019s no more time.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe fourth student in line was tasked with a heavy responsibility, but he didn\u2019t have the courage ask. Xie Yu\u2019s legend circulated the school to this day. He suggested: \u201cMaybe\u2026 we should show our true abilities\u2026\u201dWith the reality of having to rely on their own abilities sinking in, the four brothers-in-arms no longer expected to receive the answers. He Zhao, on the other hand, remained loyal. He waited several minutes, then poked Xie Yu\u2019s back again. \u201cThe answers. Quick.\u201dXie Yu bestowed upon him a single word: \u201cScram.\u201d\u201cSo cold,\u201d He Zhao said. \u201cLook up and take a look. Those four buddies. Look at their despondent and sorrowful backs. Don\u2019t you feel a pang of conscience? Do you really not have any other thoughts in your heart?\u201dXie Yu: \u201cNone of my business.\u201dHe Zhao: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cTen minutes left. Use it well.\u201d Tang Sen glanced at his watch and reminded everyone, \u201cIf you haven\u2019t finished your essay, watch your time. You should be starting to write the conclusion now.\u201dAs Tang Sen spoke, he turned and walked toward the podium.During this window of time, Xie Yu didn\u2019t turn back. He reached behind him; he didn\u2019t fumble under the desk like He Zhao had. He openly placed his hand against the edge of He Zhao\u2019s desk and said impatiently, \u201cAnswers.\u201dHe Zhao froze for a second before recovering and dropping the wadded up paper ball into Xie Yu\u2019s hand.Once Xie Yu had the paper wad in hand, he tossed it towards the desks in front. It didn\u2019t swerve or stray, and landed perfectly on the fourth classmate\u2019s desk.When He Zhao came to, he suddenly wanted to laugh.He looked down. He\u2019d long since finished his paper, so he rested his forearms on his essay. His hand covered his eyes, giving him a lazy look, and he internally said, This little friend only says \u2018none of my business\u2019\u2026 it\u2019s rather cute.Ten minutes later, the bell rang.There were two exams in the morning; the second exam was an English exam. Nobody in this exam group was in a hurry to get their books and review. Aside from those who left to go to the washroom, everyone else handed in their papers and then waited in the classroom.When the two invigilators finished collecting the papers and arranged them in order of exam number, the students stood in the doorway and waved to the both of them, shouting in unison: \u201cFriend, friend, goodbye!\u201dThe classroom descended into chaos, and someone who brought playing cards even started a game of Dou Dizhu.\u201cComing, Zhao-ge?\u201d the boy with the playing cards asked as he distributed the cards.He Zhao stood up and waved his hand. \u201cNot coming. You guys play.\u201dXie Yu was still counting his marks, adding and subtracting on a piece of paper.He Zhao walked to Xie Yu\u2019s side and bent down to take a look. Before he could make anything out, Xie Yu flipped the scratch paper over with a bang.\u201cWhat\u2019re you writing? So petty.\u201d He Zhao wasn\u2019t all that concerned. He changed the subject, asking casually, \u201cGoing to the toilet?\u201dXie Yu couldn\u2019t quite understand the mentality of group toilet visits. Were they unable to pee if they went on their own? So much damn nonsense. He put his pen down and jeered, \u201c\u2026What, do you need someone to hold it for you?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dSeeing his deskmate be so heartless, He Zhao touched his nose and went on his own.He washed his hands and loitered outside for a while, saying hi to more than ten people on the way back. The way he greeted everyone, it was like the whole year consisted of his buddies.\u201cZhao-ge.\u201d Someone stuck their head out of a classroom to call him, leaning against the side of the window. \u201cLong time no see.\u201dHe Zhao slowed his footsteps, turned, and glanced at the sign on the classroom door. He leaned against the wall and responded. \u201cExam group 5? You\u2019re pretty good, man. Your grades improved quite a bit.\u201d\u201cNot at all, not at all. You know my measure best. Your grades are only as high as your courage. In the last exam, I just accidentally copied too much, that\u2019s all.\u201dHe pulled out a box of cigarettes as he spoke and made to pull one out to give. \u201cZhongnanhai.\u00b9 Want one?\u201dHe\u2019d only pulled the cigarette out halfway when he suddenly cursed and shoved the box back.Xu Xia walked past the window of classroom 7, high heels clacking.After Xu Xia departed, he was about to take the box of cigarettes back out but He Zhao waved his hand: \u201cI\u2019m not smoking.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201dHe Zhao continued, \u201cQuit.\u201dThere were about ten minutes left until the start of the next exam.He Zhao hadn\u2019t returned to the classroom. He circled around to a deserted place near the faculty office, found an empty stairwell and sat down on the steps. He pulled a lollipop with an orange wrapper from his pocket, tore off the wrapping, and stuffed the candy in his mouth.With the lollipop still in his mouth, He Zhao looked down and sent a text to Xie Yu.It was a bad joke he\u2019d read online. Bad and not funny. Even as he sent it he imagined what Xie Yu would say: Dumb, thumbs down, scram.Before he\u2019d sent it, the sound of footsteps approached. The clack clack of high heels.He Zhao didn\u2019t look up, but the person walking by stopped.\u201cHe Zhao, what\u2019s the matter with you?!\u201d Xu Xia stood in the stairwell holding the exam booklets.Since the incident with Yang Wenyuan, she\u2019d held a grudge against He Zhao. In Xu Xia\u2019s heart, Yang Wenyuan was an isolated incident of misjudgement of character. He Zhao\u2019s image hadn\u2019t changed in her eyes\u2014a wayward delinquent with many bad qualities.All of her anger came rushing out at once. She said, \u201cWhat kind of place do you think the school is? Smoking in school? Just now in the corridor I shut one eye and didn\u2019t reprimand you, and don\u2019t you have any self-awareness? Look at you.\u201dIn the corridor, she had seen someone handing He Zhao a cigarette, and now, in the stairwell, she saw him with something in his mouth. She hadn\u2019t looked closely at all before jumping to the worst conclusion.Xu Xia hadn\u2019t finished speaking when He Zhao suddenly smiled.The youth stood up, one hand pressed against the wall. He was tall and thin and pleasing to the eye. His uniform hung loosely on him, and through the movement and creases of his clothes, one could make out the line of his waist.\u201cI should be self-aware?\u201d He Zhao was two heads taller than Xu Xia. He had originally had his back to her, and now he walked down a step and turned to face her. He said, \u201c\u2026I look like what?\u201dIn He Zhao\u2019s mouth, the lollipop was so sweet it was cloying, but the words he spoke weren\u2019t nearly as nice. \u201cMiss Xu, are your eyes rotten?\u201dSeeing that it was a lollipop, Xu Xia didn\u2019t say anything more. She tried to avoid He Zhao and walked two steps forward, intending to go downstairs.He Zhao blocked her way. \u201cYou\u2019re in a hurry and I\u2019m in a hurry. How about it. Apologize.\u201d\u201cApologize,\u201d He Zhao said again. \u201cAnd for last time, too. Apologize twice and then go.\u201dXu Xia looked down on He Zhao in her heart. Of course she wouldn\u2019t demean herself like that.He Zhao smiled and said, \u201cIs it so difficult? Teachers are supposed to lead by example. You did something wrong, and said something wrong. Can\u2019t you even say the words, I\u2019m sorry?\u201dXu Xia stood on the spot silently.Over the intercom, Dean Jiang again enthusiastically broadcast the announcements for the next exam. \u201cTeachers, please check the settings for the listening comprehension section. We will play an English passage, so adjust the volume\u2026\u201dThough He Zhao was smiling, there was disdain in his eyes. He emanated an aura that was both sharp and dangerous, as if all the energy he usually kept wrapped up in himself was now let loose, enveloping him.Xu Xia felt a strong sense of pressure.Just when she thought He Zhao was about to explode, the youth suddenly took two steps to the side and leaned against the wall, clearing the way for her.He Zhao crunched the sweet in his mouth until only the stick was left.Xu Xia froze for several seconds and walked past him. She walked down one flight of stairs and as she turned, He Zhao called out to her again: \u201cBecause my grades are bad?\u201dIn the bend in the stairwell, Xu Xia angled her chin. From her vantage point she couldn\u2019t see He Zhao\u2019s expression.He Zhao gripped the white plastic stick and said, \u201cBecause my grades are bad I\u2019m, in your words\u2026 like what?\u201dXu Xia suddenly felt like an invisible pair of hands had caught hold of her neck. She wanted to say something, but couldn\u2019t speak.The English exam was invigilated by Tang Sen and the history teacher from the class next door.He Zhao was ten minutes late.When he walked in, the whole class could tell something was off. Tang Sen was about to catch hold of him and ask him why he was late to the exam, but He Zhao didn\u2019t make \u2018I helped an old granny cross the road,\u2019 excuses as he normally did. He stood in the doorway and only said one thing: \u201cI\u2019m late, am I barred from the exam?\u201dThe question thoroughly stunned Tang Sen. \u201cAh\u2026 no, but next time\u2026\u201dHe Zhao walked straight past him to his seat.\u201cFuck it, this\u2026\u201d\u201cHe Zhao, he\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 What happened?\u201d\u201cExam booklets have been handed out. Turn to listening comprehension. It\u2019s about to start,\u201d Tang Sen said as he looked in He Zhao\u2019s direction. He went over a second time an erroneous question he\u2019d explained while He Zhao hadn\u2019t been around. \u201cReading passage A, question 3, has two duplicate choices. Amend choice c to the one on the board.\u201dXie Yu scooted back a little. \u201cWhat\u2019s gotten into you?\u201dHe Zhao was aware that he\u2019d come off badly just now; not only had he lost his temper, he\u2019d even been childish in revealing his feelings. After venting, he had recovered and was much calmer. He scratched his head and said, \u201cNothing. Just a small matter.\u201dHe raised his hand and said to Tang Sen, \u201cTeacher, I\u2019ll definitely watch out next time.\u201dThe mood changed as quickly as a typhoon.Tang Sen really couldn\u2019t figure out this kid, either, so he just said, \u201cAll right, all right.\u201dBy the time the exam was half over, He Zhao had finished writing. He was about to lie down and sleep, but the moment he dropped his head against his hand and shut his eyes, he heard two knocks from below.He half-opened his eyes and didn\u2019t move. \u201cLittle friend, what are you doing?\u201dXie Yu tapped twice with his finger, making a clear sound. \u201cHand, underneath.\u201dHe Zhao felt around underneath and felt a slip of paper.He opened it up. There was only a question mark.?This was probably the highest form of concern from his cold deskmate.He Zhao was good at counting his blessings.He thought that if he picked up a pen right now, he\u2019d be able to write a long essay on his feelings at being shown concern by the \u2018emotionless killer,\u2019 and it\u2019d fill a whole sheet of paper. But when he picked up the pen, and the tip fell onto the paper and blotched it with ink, he paused, and only wrote four words:\u2014What am I like?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

More like grandson.After Xie Yu finished speaking, He Zhao didn\u2019t say anything for a long time.Just as Xie Yu thought the conversation would end, He Zhao suddenly said, \u201cAs for me. I\u2019m damn suave.\u201dThe two lay shoulder to shoulder on the quad, both their positions sloppy. They were so tired they didn\u2019t have energy to expend on worrying about appearances. He Zhao lay spread-eagled and felt like his body temperature was several degrees higher than the surface of the quad.Xie Yu didn\u2019t have the energy to mock him; he was quite impressed by He Zhao\u2019s thick skin. He moved his leg as if to kick him, but missed because He Zhao suddenly pulled himself into a sitting position.He Zhao continued, \u201cReally. Have you seen anyone more suave than me? In this world of people, to be able to meet someone like me\u2026\u201dXie Yu said, \u201cYou\u2019re really something.\u201dHe Zhao: \u201cEven the pen spirit said there wasn\u2019t anyone, no?\u201dXie Yu remembered the evening self-study period when they\u2019d summoned the pen spirit, and suddenly wanted to laugh.\u201cOf course there is. Who says there isn\u2019t?\u201d Xie Yu suddenly thought of playing a joke. He looked at He Zhao, then pointed at himself. \u201cYour grandpa. Me.\u201dHe Zhao: \u201cGrandpa?\u201dXie Yu answered, \u201cYes, grandson.\u201d\u201cYou, my ass. You\u2019re taking advantage of me, aren\u2019t you?\u201dAfter suddenly being diminished by two generations, He Zhao laughed and went for Xie Yu\u2019s collar, pretending to be fierce. He didn\u2019t control his strength properly, and he didn\u2019t expect Xie Yu to just lie there and let him do what ever he wanted without retaliating.He used too much force and pulled Xie Yu\u2019s collar wide open.Xie Yu\u2019s complexion was pale and his skin was somewhat flushed after the run underneath the hot sun. That tinge of pink peeked through from beneath his pale skin; he was sprightly and slender, so beautiful it was alluring.\u201cNow who\u2019s taking advantage of whom?\u201d Xie Yu tapped He Zhao\u2019s hand. \u201cLet go.\u201dHe Zhao let go, sat down, and stayed stunned for a while. Then he lay back down and forced out, \u201cYou\u2026 you have a good figure.\u201dXie Yu replied smoothly, \u201cThank you, you too.\u201dThe tangled thoughts in He Zhao\u2019s mind ground to a halt and He Zhao almost forgot what he was annoyed about.But he still felt hot; from his throat to his suddenly tight chest, there was a warmth he couldn\u2019t describe.It burned, a little.He Zhao wasn\u2019t sure what he was thinking of, either. His mind froze and, as if possessed by a ghost, he glanced down at his pants.\u2026\u2026Xie Yu wasn\u2019t aware that He Zhao\u2019s thoughts, after taking several twists and turns, had run very far away. He lay down and looked up at the sky for a while and shut his eyes when he got sick of it.The surroundings were quiet. He heard He Zhao\u2019s breathing.He also heard He Zhao\u2019s heartbeat, overly fast, that still hadn\u2019t slowed down.A moment later, Xie Yu closed his eyes and asked, \u201cYour heart is beating fast. Are you very tired?\u201dHe Zhao wiped his face and wasn\u2019t sure how to reply. \u201cAh, yes\u2026 tired from running.\u201dLuo Wenqiang had run about ten rounds and collapsed on the ground roughly half the courtyard away from them.After resting, he went to the vending machine to get a drink, and picked up two more bottles for his running-crazed classmates on the way. He cut through the courtyard to He Zhao and Xie Yu. He squatted and passed them the drinks. \u201cWah, the two of you\u2026 fifteen rounds? You really ran fifteen rounds?\u201dThe drinks were ice-cold, emanating a chill.Xie Yu said, \u201cThank you.\u201dHe Zhao sat up and took the drink. He twisted open the cap, angled his head back, and gulped more than half of it down. \u201cAren\u2019t we impressive? Are you scared? He said fifteen rounds, so fifteen rounds it is.\u201d\u201cImpressive, impressive.\u201d Luo Wenqiang now revealed his intentions in coming over. \u201cDuring the autumn sports meet, you two should run the long-distance event.\u201dHe had changed the subject too quickly and He Zhao couldn\u2019t react in time. \u201cAh?\u201dThis was the first time someone had invited Xie Yu to participate in a team event. Long-distance was fine, but Class 3\u2019s gym rep really was overenthusiastic: if the sports meet went ahead as planned, it was still more than a fortnight away and they hadn\u2019t even been informed what time it would happen.But Luo Wenqiang shook his head and said, \u201cAh, life passes by in the snap of a finger.\u201dXie Yu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe Zhao: \u201c\u2026..\u201d Bro, you\u2019re too enlightened for us.After chatting for a while, they got up and went back to the classroom.As they walked down the corridor they noticed several classes were in uproar. The calm facade wasn\u2019t sustainable and erupted into chaos.\u201cSo noisy.\u201d Passing by class 8, they noticed that Shen Jie and some others were singing karaoke. He Zhao stuffed one finger in his ear in order to avoid the direct assault and said, \u201cWhy is our classroom the only one with the blinds shut so tight? And so silent? Not our usual style, at all.\u201dAs He Zhao spoke, he pushed open Class 3\u2019s back door.A movie was currently playing on the big screen and it was about halfway through.Class president Liu Cunhao had made the sacrifice of sitting beside the podium; the moment there was any movement outside, he\u2019d move the mouse and turn the movie off.\u201cYou scared me.\u201d Seeing who came through the door, Liu Cunhao pulled the movie up again. \u201cI wondered who it was. Come on, let\u2019s keep watching. If you want to place bets, go to Wan Da. No take-backs once you\u2019ve bet.\u201dThe blinds were shut so tightly there wasn\u2019t a single crack for light to peek through. The lights were all off, too. They\u2019d really created the atmosphere of a mini-theater.Xie Yu didn\u2019t understand. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re guessing who the murderer is.\u201d Wan Da introduced the movie to them. \u201cThis is a mystery-suspense. Fifty cents a bet. Placing a wager, sir?\u201d\u201cNo, no. This isn\u2019t fair to me and Old Xie. We don\u2019t even know what happened in the first half.\u201d He Zhao then gave praise: \u201cBut I have to admit, you have good business sense.\u201dThe class celebration didn\u2019t last even half an hour before Dean Jiang broke it up himself. \u201cAll right! In the time it took me to mark the exam papers, you all tried to overturn the sky?!\u201dMad Dog grumbled all the way from class 8 to here. \u201cClass 8 treats their classroom like a KTV, and you all use it as a movie theatre. Very creative, all of you! Do you even know what grades you got? How can you be so happy and excited?!\u201dHe Zhao bent close to Xie Yu\u2019s ear and said, \u201cEither way, we\u2019re about to die. Might as well die happy.\u201dDean Jiang pointed at the last row. \u201cWhat are you talking about with your heads so close together? Fifteen rounds wasn\u2019t enough?\u201dHe Zhao was about to say, \u201cWe weren\u2019t talking,\u201d when his good deskmate straight-up back-stabbed him. Xie Yu repeated what He Zhao had said just now.The whole class broke into laughter.\u201cIf you have a death wish, then I\u2019ll grant it for you.\u201d Dean Jiang was furious beyond belief. \u201cHe Zhao, you get out of class. Stand in the hallway.\u201dHe Zhao was used to it, and scampered off with the ease of much practice.Dean Jiang still seemed to have several mini-essay rants in him. After sending He Zhao outside to await his punishment, he kept talking at class 3. Outside, He Zhao got tired of standing and took several steps back toward the classroom. He leaned against the doorframe of the back door and chatted with Xie Yu. \u201cLittle friend, you\u2019re not very loyal.\u201dXie Yu returned the courtesy: \u201cYou\u2019re very annoying.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026As for the phenomenon of live-in students being late, we\u2019ve thought of a method to cure you.\u201d Dean Jiang had talked all the way from classroom decorum to lateness. \u201cStarting tomorrow morning, all the students here will feel a new wake-up force.\u201dA wake-up force.Right now, they were very much feeling the force of someone wanting to kill.The next morning, a deafening broadcast rang through the dormitory building. The tune of \u2018Loyalty to the Country\u2019 exploded into everyone\u2019s ears.\u201cWhen the fiery smoke rises I look at the vast land towards the north\uff0c the roaring of the dragons and neighing of the horses~\u201d\u201cI am willing to station here and re-claim my land, The mighty China should be~\u201d\u00b9Passion permeated the blustering song, so magnificent and ambitious it could reach the clouds! It was enough to awaken hot-blooded patriotism within every man of this country! The newly awakened sense of duty and passion for learning was set to boiling!At six in the morning, the dormitory building erupted.They climbed out of their beds, so hurried they didn\u2019t even bother putting on their slippers. They pulled open their doors and said in tacit synchrony, \u201cFuck!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? What\u2019s happening? It\u2019s six in the morning, will you let us sleep?\u201d\u201cWho the hell is playing music?!\u201dHe Zhao pulled his blankets back up, preparing to endure through the length of the song.Eventually, he succumbed to the headache brought on by this blaring broadcast and the many-layered curses and complaints outside his door. He couldn\u2019t take it any longer and pushed himself up. \u201c\u2026What the hell.\u201dAfter a night\u2019s sleep, the aftereffects of running 15 laps yesterday now all rushed forth. He had injured his ankle not long ago and the stress of intensive long-distance running had taken its toll.He Zhao scratched at his hair, got out of bed, put on his slippers, and stumbled slowly to his door. He pulled open his dorm room door and yelled, \u201cSo annoying. Loyalty to the Country? Yeah, really.\u201dHe Zhao\u2019s voice wasn\u2019t loud but it was distinctive. He always lifted his voice up at the end and it always carried a note of casual teasing.Someone saw him and stopped complaining. \u201cMorning, Zhao-ge.\u201dHe Zhao didn\u2019t say anything, only waved to the person as he yawned. Then he stumbled over to the door opposite his and stopped. With a \u2018go through thick and thin together\u2019 mentality he knocked on the door and called out to Xie Yu, \u201cOld Xie, rise and shine, Old Xie\u2026 He can even sleep through this?\u201dHe Zhao\u2019s hair was in disarray and he hadn\u2019t straightened his clothes, either. After knocking for a while with no response, even, \u2018Loyalty to the Country\u2019 had also stopped playing. He was about to go back and catch up on sleep when the door in front of him opened with a creak.\u201cAre you fucking done or not.\u201d Xie Yu pulled the earplugs from his ears and leaned against the doorframe, looking at him. \u201cOut with it, quick.\u201dHeedless of whether Xie Yu welcomed him in or not, He Zhao shot by him and into the room. \u201cLooking for you so we can get breakfast.\u201dXie Yu didn\u2019t shut the door, only stood in the doorway looking at him. His eyes were clearly yelling, \u2018Get out.\u2019He Zhao just pretended he hadn\u2019t seen anything.Although the song had stopped broadcasting, Dean Jiang\u2019s speech had only just started. \u201cHello, hello? Can you hear this? Ah, good. Good morning, students! It\u2019s said that all plans are best started in the morning\u2026\u201dHe Zhao was straight-up shocked. \u201cDamn it, he\u2019s not done?\u201dXie Yu lifted a hand and rubbed his temple.This way, he wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep even if he wanted to. He might as well shut the door and go shower.\u201cThat math exam from yesterday. Really. The math teachers were so touched they cried.\u201d Xie Yu was brushing his teeth; He Zhao stood in the doorway to the private bathroom, leaned against the wall, and shot the breeze. \u201cJust wait for him to praise me. I\u2019ve never had such a hot hand doing exams in my life. I knew every answer\u2026\u201dXie Yu finished brushing his teeth and got some water from the sink, splashing it on his face.Just as He Zhao said, \u201cThis time I\u2019ll definitely pass,\u201d Xie Yu finished wiping his face and tossed the towel right on He Zhao\u2019s face.It would have been fine if he hadn\u2019t mentioned it. Just thinking about the monthly exam made Xie Yu annoyed. He thought: Like hell you\u2019ll pass.\u201cWhat\u2019s this.\u201d He Zhao pulled the towel from his face. \u201cGot up on the wrong side of bed?\u201dXie Yu put his hand by the side of his zipper and pulled it down a little. It was clear what he was about to do. \u201cClose the door and get out of the way.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019re you shy for? We\u2019re all guys here.\u201dAlthough He Zhao said this on the surface, he still obligingly turned and walked towards the desk.Xie Yu unzipped his fly and ignored him.Yesterday afternoon, during the math exam, Xie Yu had asked He Zhao how he had answered in order to adjust his own answers accordingly.The exam had been comprised mostly of the after-class assignment questions with some small modifications, such as changing a 10 into a 20. Scoring too low would make him look like an idiot.When He Zhao had said he\u2019d done pretty well, he had actually believed it.After all, He Zhao wasn\u2019t completely inattentive during class. Since the last time he had provoked the math teacher, he hadn\u2019t had a good time in math class; he couldn\u2019t use his phone, so he had to keep his eyes fixed on the blackboard.Who knew if he\u2019d actually understood. He ran his mouth all the time anyway: \u201cSo that\u2019s it. So simple. Do you get this question? I got it.\u201dGot it my\u2026 hammer.When the papers were being collected, Xie Yu had glanced at He Zhao\u2019s answers and discovered that He Zhao had thoroughly betrayed his trust.He Zhao walked around the room twice then sat on Xie Yu\u2019s bed.Xie Yu finished going to the toilet, then cleaned the whole bathroom on the way. After he finished washing his hands, he saw that He Zhao\u2014He Zhao who had so much free time to come knocking on his door and who was yelling about eating breakfast\u2014had lain down on his bed and fallen asleep again.The hem of He Zhao\u2019s shirt had ridden up. He looked tall and skinny but he had everything he ought to.There were prominent lines of muscle where his waist met his abdomen, rising and falling with his breathing. But teenage youthfulness diluted their striking effect some.He Zhao\u2019s face was half buried in the blanket.Xie Yu twisted his wrists to exercise the joints. He wanted to punch someone.The monthly exams were over. Regardless of how they did, everyone had gone back to the state of relaxation they called \u2018loving living life.\u2019The students filing through the school gates were occupied chatting about celebrities and idols and yesterday night\u2019s TV drama episode. Mad Dog was hot on the heels of the morning bell and stood at the gates to catch latecomers.The teachers at Erzhong graded assignments efficiently. In the evening, they took the papers home and worked overtime to grade them, so they could give out grades the following day.Wan Da squatted outside the faculty office for an entire class period, head turned to one side with his ear pressed against the door. When Tang Sen pulled open the door to throw out his rubbish, he stood up suddenly, turned, and ran for the toilet to hide.\u201cWait up.\u201d Tang Sen wasn\u2019t blind and he beckoned to Wan Da. \u201cCome over here.\u201dWhen Tang Sen took the job, he had heard the other teachers say this student was fond of listening around corners; today, he had witnessed it for himself. With a trash bag in his hand he took several steps forward and asked, \u201cWhat did you hear?\u201dWan Da said, \u201cOur class is the bottom of the barrel. The first and second in the year are both in our class\u2026 first and second from last, that is. Class 2\u2019s average is the highest and someone scored full marks in math. Xu Qingqing did well in English\u2026 the literature teacher from next door is getting married next month.\u201dInside, Tang Sen had only glimpsed Wan Da\u2019s head; who knew he\u2019d actually heard this much. \u201cYour ears are pretty sharp. How many ears do you have, exactly? What else did you hear?\u201dWan Da: \u201cThat\u2019s all. Report complete.\u201dSeeing that it was about time to start class, Tang Sen figured there wasn\u2019t time to instruct him, either. \u201cIf you have free time, read a book. Now, go to class. Right\u2014tell He Zhao to come by my office at noon.\u201dWan Da hurriedly agreed.Tang Sen took several more steps then turned around, paused, and said, \u201c\u2026\u2026Tell Xie Yu to come, too.\u201dIn the classroom.He Zhao sat in his seat and kept playing the low-stakes pen-and-paper game that he and Xie Yu hadn\u2019t determined a winner for during last class period: 5 in a row. At the end of last literature period they were at a 2:2 draw.He Zhao was very good at logical thinking and thought very strategically. Every time Xie Yu was about to link five stones together, He Zhao always managed to stick a foot in and break the line. Considering He Zhao\u2019s intelligence level, Xie Yu wasn\u2019t sure if this was accidental.Wan Da came back to class hot on the heels of the bell. \u201cZhao-ge, Yu-ge, Old Tang told the two of you to go to his office at noon. The two of you\u2026 how do you get last in the year every time?\u201dOn hearing this, He Zhao knew that Wan Da had eavesdropped on the exam results. He put down his pen and asked, \u201cWhat position from last was I?\u201dXie Yu had already guessed the outcome and didn\u2019t even look up.Exactly as expected, Wan Da said, \u201cLast. And your math score was only ten points.\u201dHe Zhao seemed to have sunk so deep into his dreams of passing, he couldn\u2019t extricate himself. When he heard the words \u2018ten points\u2019 he was a little surprised. \u201cJust one step away from single digits?\u201dWan Da said: \u201cRight?? Extraordinarily impressive. Dragged our whole class average down two points.\u201dAs Wan Da finished, he discovered that He Zhao seemed a little down. He asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Zhao-ge?\u201d\u201cIgnore him. He hasn\u2019t fully woken up,\u201d Xie Yu said. \u201cStill waiting for the math teacher to praise him\u2026 Go back to sleep. Everything you want is in your dreams.\u201dWan Da felt that, as of late, he\u2019d more or less gotten to know Xie Yu, so he spoke directly: \u201cYu-ge, you scored 20. About the same, just as bad.\u201dXie Yu: \u201c\u2026\u2026You asking to get hit?\u201dHe Zhao laughed out loud, getting louder all the time.In the afternoon, Tang Sen quickly finished earing lunch, rushed back to his office, and waited for the two students who occupied last place and second-to-last place to come to see him.He had written up several speech outlines, but in the end he decided to improvise.\u201cMr. Tang, they\u2019ve been like that since first year in high school.\u201d Several other teachers in the vicinity had watched Tang Sen spend a long time going over the monthly exam papers for these two students, and they also heard that he had sent for them for an afternoon talk. \u201cJust teach them normally. They really will not listen, and there\u2019s nothing you can do. I\u2019m not telling you to give up on them or anything, but these two\u2026 really, there\u2019s no way. No way.\u201dTang Sen continued flipping through He Zhao and Xie Yu\u2019s exam papers, and didn\u2019t agree with or refute the other teacher\u2019s words. He didn\u2019t think that he was doing a thankles job at all. He said, \u201cI am teaching normally\u2014giving my best effort. I haven\u2019t yet given my best effort.\u201dMore than ten minutes later, the two of them arrived and knocked in succession. \u201cReporting in.\u201dTang Sen closed the textbook in his hands. \u201cCome in.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t hard to guess why Tang Sen had sent for them; doubtlessly, it was to chastise them for their grades. In first year of high school, all the subject teachers had sent for them in this way. It was just a chat, and after the chat things would still be the same as they were.He Zhao had a relaxed air about him. He probably encountered such situations often.\u201cThe two of you, sit.\u201d Tang Sen put their exam papers on the desk. \u201cI want to ask you both. What do you find difficult about these topics? If you tell me, we can solve it together.\u201dIn other words, \u2018How on earth did you two get such bad grades?\u2019Xie Yu couldn\u2019t give a reason. He knew the right answer, so he avoided it completely. He was worried he\u2019d shock Mr. Tang if he said it.This time, it was He Zhao who replied smoothly, \u201cEverything is difficult.\u201d\u201cHe Zhao, just a little while ago I praised you to your form teacher for doing all right in math class.\u201d As they spoke, the math teacher finished his lunch and walked in, toothpick still in hand. \u201cWhy were your exam results like this?\u201dHe Zhao didn\u2019t answer.Xie Yu answered on his deskmate\u2019s behalf: \u201cIn class he thought he understood, too.\u201dThis time, it was the math teacher who wasn\u2019t sure how to reply. He shook his head and returned to his seat. \u201cYou\u2026 the two of you are really something.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Xie Yu thought Old Tang was going to briefly go over the monthly exam with them.But Tang Sen asked instead, \u201cYou like to play video games?\u201dIn order for the pretense to seem genuine, even though they didn\u2019t really like them, they had to nod.Xie Yu: \u201cMm.\u201dHe Zhao: \u201cYup. I like them a lot.\u201d\u201cI gave it a try, too. That very popular game, He Zhao, that I heard you\u2019ve been playing.\u201d Tang Sen didn\u2019t mention the exam papers. He took out his phone. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect your taste to be so\u2026 innocent and pure.\u201d\u201cInnocent and pure?\u201dHe wasn\u2019t sure how Old Tang had come to the very strange conclusion of \u2018innocent and pure.\u2019While Old Tang was looking down at his phone, He Zhao nudged Xie Yu with his arm. \u201cIs he saying I\u2019m childish?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know, and I don\u2019t want to know.\u201d\u201cThen how am I innocent and pure? A man like Old Tang probably likes to play chess, drink tea, and birdwatch in his free time.\u201d The more He Zhao thought, the more he wanted to know what this was about. \u201cHe probably doesn\u2019t play King of Guns or Planet Terror.\u201dAs Tang Sen opened the game, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s not that I think video games are bad. There are two sides to everything. The good side is it lets people relax and have fun, while also exercising one\u2019s self-control\u2026\u201dHe Zhao ignored the rest and nodded in agreement. \u201cYes. I agree. You make a lot of sense.\u201dXie Yu saw a very familiar pink flash across Tang Sen\u2019s phone screen.But he\u2019d only glimpsed it. As Tang Sen got excited, he put his phone away and continued talking. \u201cThis self-control and willpower is very strong. There are many temptations in the world. For example\u2026\u201dHe Zhao got a little sleepy while listening and secretly stuck his hand in front of Xie Yu.Xie Yu looked down. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cPinch me,\u201d He Zhao said. \u201cI\u2019m having trouble staying awake.\u201dXie Yu had just touched the back of He Zhao\u2019s hand and hadn\u2019t yet had time to pinch when Tang Sen changed the subject from self-control to studying, and then from studying to games. Then Tang Sen slid his phone over and, after seeing the pink game interface, He Zhao was suddenly wide awake. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dTang Sen talked for another half an hour and the class bell rang before he let them go.When He Zhao left, he forgot his manners and didn\u2019t even say, \u201cGoodbye, Mr. Tang.\u201dXie Yu wanted to laugh very much but held it in.He Zhao walked quickly. He took several steps then stopped again. Seeing Xie Yu, he reminded him, \u201cDon\u2019t laugh. I\u2019m this fucking close to exploding.\u201dThe first afternoon class was history. When they returned, the history teacher was already in the classroom.\u201cQuick, come in. Class has started. Why are you still dawdling?\u201d the history teacher said, opening a book. \u201cThe bell has rung, so quickly get to your seats and sit down.\u201dJust now in the faculty office, Tang Sen had shown them his score in the dressup game and explained some of his thoughts on the game. At the end, he\u2019d compared the game to studying and hoped it would ignite some interest in them for studying.\u201cThe game gives you a dressup theme every level and the player has to think about it\u2026 Take a look at this reading comprehension question. Actually, doing questions is very similar\u2026 Why not this skirt? Why is this answer wrong? You have to think about it and solve the question.\u201dXie Yu could understand Tang Sen\u2019s intentions. He was trying to tell He Zhao, using this method, that studying could also become an interesting and fun \u2018game.\u2019But the way he delivered his message was really too shocking.At the podium, the history teacher was starting a new chapter.The more Xie Yu thought about it, the less he could stand it. He was about to lie down and go to sleep, but then he put his face in one hand and his shoulders started shaking.He Zhao\u2019s mind was still entirely occupied by Tang Sen\u2019s words, \u201cthis skirt or that skirt,\u201d and he turned, about to ask Xie Yu if Old Tang had gone mad, when he found Xie Yu holding his face, laughing.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d He Zhao paused and then said, \u201cIf you\u2019re a loyal bro, don\u2019t mock me now.\u201dXie Yu very clearly chose not to be a loyal bro.He Zhao could only turn back. This little brat. No conscience. If He Zhao didn\u2019t see, he wouldn\u2019t be troubled.Several minutes later, He Zhao couldn\u2019t help scooting closer and telling Little Mr. No-Conscience: \u201cActually, I have one more question.\u201d\u201c\uff1f\u201d\u201cHow is Old Tang\u2019s level higher than mine? I\u2019m a true blue Renminbi player\u2026\u201d He Zhao cut himself off halfway. \u201cOld Xie, you\u2019re too much. Terrible. You\u2019re still laughing?\u201dHe Zhao really wanted to go to the toilet, squat, and smoke a cigarette, but all he could do was pull out a piece of candy.\u201cI bet fifty cents. It\u2019s definitely Wan Da, that grandson.\u201d\u00b9 He Zhao glanced over the people in class. \u201cWho would it be, if not him? Wind whistles through his mouth even when it\u2019s closed.\u201dWan Da had inexplicably been saddled with blame and he didn\u2019t even know it.The monthly exams were quickly graded. The next morning, when students trickled through the school doors, the class rankings were already up on the bulletin board. Names densely covered the whole board, black ink on white paper.The live-in students had not yet gotten accustomed to the wake-up bell of \u2018Loyalty to the Country\u2019 and the radio station\u2019s DJ Jiang\u2019s twenty-minute speech every morning: \u201cWe must fight hard! Bring forth all our effort and don\u2019t let our future selves regret!\u201dXie Yu was accustomed to being woken up. Outside his door, the hot-blooded live-in students were doing their morning complaint exercises.And He Zhao from the opposite dorm room had sent him a text. He had probably been woken up, too. There was only one word in the text: Day.Several minutes later, another text arrived.Little friend, are you up?No.Me neither. I endured the twenty minutes and then went back to sleep.You\u2019re not going to morning classes?First period is Old Tang\u2019s class. Let me dawdle.He Zhao didn\u2019t go to first period, but his exam paper was passed around the class again.\u201cIf we made Zhao-ge\u2019s literature exams into a booklet, it would be a veritable fountain of entertainment,\u201d Liu Cunhao said. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen more impressive thought processes than his. He even curses the question-maker\u2026 damn it.\u201d\u201cHave you seen his essays? For the silhouette topic, he writes about his own silhouette. The first sentence\u2014I think my silhouette is especially suave. Then it becomes a wild 800-word boast.\u201d\u201cHa ha ha ha ha ha ha I\u2019m going to die laughing. Yu-ge, have you seen it? Come over here and look at it with us.\u201dXie Yu had never realized as clearly as in this moment that in the short month since school had begun, his life had undergone a big change.Suddenly, there was much more noise.These noises had tyrannically forced their way into his life, little by little.Very noisy, and very annoying.He Zhao timed his arrival well and slipped into the classroom right as as literature class was letting out.Xu Qingqing was distributing the English exam papers and she reminded him, \u201cYou haven\u2019t turned in your English homework.\u201dHe Zhao had just gotten to the door. \u201cWhat English homework?\u201d\u201cCopy the vocabulary words from the next chapter, four times each.\u201d When Xu Qingqing finished explaining, she stuffed two English exam papers into He Zhao\u2019s hands. \u201cThese are yours and your deskmate\u2019s. You scored 30, your deskmate 25.\u201dThough the two of them got very similar grades, most teachers preferred grading Xie Yu\u2019s exams compared to He Zhao\u2019s. Xie Yu\u2019s handwriting was nice, and they wouldn\u2019t end up staring at the exam for a long time without being able to figure out what was written on it.He Zhao wasn\u2019t concerned about his score and the questions he got wrong. He rolled the two exam papers into a cylinder, walked over to Xie Yu, bent down, and knocked at the side of his desk. \u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201dXie Yu didn\u2019t even lift his head. \u201cYour essay.\u201dHe Zhao: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been passed around all class period. It just got back from class 8,\u201d Xie Yu said. \u201cRight. You have a new nickname. Silhouette Bro.\u201dShen Jie had specially slipped out of class midway, using going to the toilet as an excuse. He\u2019d snuck over to class 3 and squatted outside, telling Wan Da to pass He Zhao\u2019s exam paper through the window. He said Class 8 was very interested in the 0-point essay.It went all the way to class 8! He Zhao didn\u2019t need to ask to know which bastard son of a goat had done it. \u201cWhat on earth? That sounds so bad. It doesn\u2019t reflect my talent at all.\u201dHe Zhao was explaining how the nickname should have been \u2018Literary Genius\u2019 or something like that when Wan Da rushed through the door. Every time he went to the bathroom during class time, he couldn\u2019t keep himself from listening at the faculty office door and bringing some half-true strange news back. \u201cBig important news! Zhao-ge, this is very bad.\u201dHe Zhao tossed the exam paper in his hand onto the table. He didn\u2019t really take it to heart, but he still played along. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Don\u2019t rush. Talk it through slowly.\u201d\u201cClass rep took your exam paper to go see Old Tang. He said that, in order to pull up the class average, he wants to counsel you two, one on one.\u201d Wan Da expertly summarized what he had heard at the faculty office. \u201cHe said he needs to bear the heavy responsibility of study rep. Old Tang is still thinking about it.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s for real?\u201dThe rumor that Xue Xisheng didn\u2019t sleep and only studied had been dispelled several days ago. One fire extinguisher from Ding Lianghua had shattered both the dorm ghost talk and the panda rumors.The study rep did like to study, but not to the point where he didn\u2019t value his life. This was his first time sleeping away from home. He wasn\u2019t used to his new bed, so he had developed insomnia and couldn\u2019t sleep enough. Because his learning attitude was so proper, people found him hard to get to know and didn\u2019t realize what was happening.When Xue Xisheng returned from the office, he didn\u2019t say anything. It looked like Old Tang hadn\u2019t agreed.Almost every morning class was spent going over the exam papers. There were two periods of math back-to-back and after going over the paper the math teacher asked, \u201cDo you all understand?\u201dHe Zhao joined in the fun: \u201cUnderstood.\u201dThe math teacher aimed the chalk he hadn\u2019t put down and tossed it at the last row. \u201cStudent, don\u2019t think so highly of yourself that you think you understand.\u201dHe Zhao had been much more attentive in class as of late, and he hadn\u2019t spent much time playing games. Old Tang\u2019s lecture might have put a shadow in his heart.But now that He Zhao wasn\u2019t playing phone games any longer, he was especially annoying. He had learned palm-reading from Wan Da and asked Xie Yu to hold out his hand, saying he\u2019d learned everything there was to know and that his reasons were very accurate.Xie Yu endured all the way to evening self-study before he couldn\u2019t hold it back any more. \u201cWhat about your stinking man? You\u2019re not playing any more?\u201dHe Zhao was stunned.\u201cAh.\u201d Who knew what sore point the words \u2018stinking man\u2019 had hit. He Zhao leaned back and said, after a pause, \u201cThat\u2026 I\u2019m not playing any more.\u201dRight up until the dismissal bell rang, He Zhao didn\u2019t bother Xie Yu about palm-reading again.After evening self-study let out, they were walking down the road when He Zhao suddenly said, \u201cCan\u2019t keep chasing that stinking man any more.\u201dXie Yu didn\u2019t quite understand these sudden words. \u201cWhat?\u201dEven though the streetlights had come on, the surroundings were still dark.\u201cMy sister changed her account password.\u201d He Zhao took two steps forward and said calmly, \u201c\u2026Actually, I stole the account credentials.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 55": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fake SlackersChapter 033 - Why should my little friend smile for you?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayFake SlackersTranslator: JuryEditor: NomNomFirst Published on Chaleuria\u2014033 \u2013 Why should my little friend smile for you?He Zhao didn\u2019t seem to mind talking about himself at all.He seemed not to care that his family was separated and that his mother had brought his sister out of the country. When they left, his sister had only been three years old. She hadn\u2019t even been able to talk properly and had followed behind him mumbling \u2018gege.\u2019\u00b9Their first year in C Country, He Xi had still cried and yelled for her brother. But children forget quickly. As time went by, she grew up and went to school, and her brother became like the doll she wouldn\u2019t put down as a child because she loved it so much\u2014it became outdated and gradually retreated from center stage.While explaining, He Zhao didn\u2019t feel down. In fact, he felt fine. Thankfully, she had been young and could forget many things in the blink of an eye.And embrace her new life.Xie Yu wasn\u2019t sure what to say, so he didn\u2019t say anything at all.\u201c\u2026I\u2019ll say it again. It\u2019s really not that tragic. This isn\u2019t some heartbreaking soap opera about amnesia, she just isn\u2019t close to me,\u201d He Zhao said. \u201cShe\u2019s pretty good at playing games. Every time I log in, her equipment and level\u2014even the stinking man she\u2019s with\u2014is different. It\u2019s quite impressive.\u201dHe Zhao\u2019s EQ was something special.Xie Yu couldn\u2019t tell whether to consider it high or low. All in all, he could probably be considered a drama king who had made up his mind to do things he himself considered emotionally moving.For example, this matter\u2014He Zhao\u2019s little sister, far away in C Country, logged into a game and discovered that the level she couldn\u2019t pass had been passed and the male character she had put a lot of effort into pursuing had run away.This was yet another instance of He Zhao moving himself, moving heaven, and moving earth, but not being able to move the other party.Xie Yu said, \u201cYou\u2019re impressed? Do you feel especially touched when you think about it?\u201dHe Zhao squatted by the flowerbeds and laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t say that. Maybe a little bit.\u201dXie Yu had never been curious about other people\u2019s stories. He only felt that He Zhao was a big idiot.Maybe other people didn\u2019t know, but Xie Yu knew everything. He had seen He Zhao play this idiotic game with his own eyes; he played in class, he played after class, and sometimes he sent Xie Yu screenshots in the middle of the night, asking him which of two pairs of shoes to pick.Xie Yu should have thought: What damn business is this of mine? But he seemed to be possessed. Xie Yu wasn\u2019t sure what he had been thinking either. He suddenly bent down, and by the time he came back to his senses his hand was already resting on He Zhao\u2019s head.Both of them were a little stunned.He Zhao\u2019s hair was short and it pricked Xie Yu\u2019s hand.Of the options \u2018push him down\u2019 and \u2018immediately take your hand away, turn, and go,\u2019 Xie Yu picked the latter. \u201cI\u2019m leaving.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go together.\u201d He Zhao jumped down and followed, raising a hand to the top of his head as he walked. \u201cWas there something on my head? What are you walking so quickly for?\u201dXie Yu went back and took a shower. He didn\u2019t even dry his hair. He squatted by his bed and stuck an arm under it, pulling out the suitcase underneath.Inside were study materials. Mock exams and the notes he took in class, a whole box full of them. They usually lay quietly under his bed, under lock and key.He thought that he could do some questions to calm down.Xie Yu squatted by the luggage bag. He stared at it for several seconds, touching the cover of the 5-3. Then he looked up and out the window. In the dark night sky hung several faint stars. For some reason, he suddenly thought of He Zhao\u2019s smile as he had squatted beneath the streetlights. Very bright, like it could tear apart the night.He Zhao looked like he led a carefree life.Xie Yu wondered where He Zhao found so many things to be happy about. Two days ago he had been so happy drinking soda that he got another bottle. He\u2019d passed the bottlecap from the back of the classroom to the front to show off to Liu Cunhao and the others. \u201cJust touch it\u2026 touch it! A day\u2019s good luck starts from your big bro\u2019s bottlecap.\u201dXu Qingqing had been doing a mock exam and didn\u2019t give him face. \u201cWhat is this? You think you\u2019re a koi?\u201d\u00b2\u201cHow can you say that, Qing-jie? You\u2019re fortunate Zhao-ge doesn\u2019t hit girls. Hey, Zhao-ge, I\u2019m not like her. I\u2019ll come support you.\u201d Wan Da exaggerated as he spoke. \u201cAh, I\u2019ve touched it. I feel its power. Heavens, this mysterious power from a different and ancient time\u2014Zhao-ge, I\u2019m a little thirsty. Can you give me this lucky bottlecap to keep?\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t.\u201d He Zhao stuck out his hand to take it back. \u201cI\u2019m keeping it for my deskmate.\u201dBut Xie Yu didn\u2019t cherish it. When he walked into the classroom and saw the bottlecap, he said: \u201cIf you want to toss out trash, do it yourself.\u201dAt this point, Xie Yu suddenly realized that recently he\u2019d been hearing the words \u2018He Zhao\u2019 more and more.Even Zhou Dalei had found out he had a handsome devil for a deskmate. When the two occasionally chatted on the phone, the conversation would suddenly come around to the handsome devil.Zhou Dalei had noticed something was amiss and asked, \u201cYou two are close? Boss Xie, I\u2019ve known you for so many years and this is the first time I\u2019ve seen you make a friend. Why do I feel like a proud old dad?\u201dWhen Xie Yu and Gu Xuelan had first come to Black Water Street, Dalei had still been the boy king of Black Water Street. He was unbearably wild. He had watched the two of them, whose manners and bearings were so different from the misfits in this area, step down from the long-distance bus.Although they had been on the road for more than forty hours and the travel had been hard, the two of them were still on high alert. Especially the younger one\u2014his eyes seemed to conceal knives, so sharp they were. They seemed to be assessing everybody they landed on.Dalei was young and still immature, and he thought Xie Yu was a girl when he saw him. He thought that this little girl was very pretty and had tossed a stone at her to show he liked her. The second day, when his dad and mom went to work, the ice-cold \u2018little girl\u2019 came on a revenge visit. His temper was unbearably hot, and he straight-up caught hold of Zhou Dalei, pinned him to the ground, and started beating him up. \u201cYou dare throw stones at me? Do you have any manners? Shall I teach you?\u201dAre we close? Xie Yu asked himself.He and He Zhao\u2026 probably couldn\u2019t be considered close.Aside from the exciting monthly exams, the rest of the week passed uneventfully.Only Xue Xisheng still refused to give up. Every day he came to see Xie Yu and He Zhao, hoping the two of them would join his study group to study and strive hard together to pull the class average up.\u201c43 points. That\u2019s the distance between our average and Class 1\u2019s.\u201d Xue Xisheng wasn\u2019t afraid of these two well-known gangsters. Or should it be said that even though he knew the gangsters would beat people up, he was willing to risk his life?\u201cAs the study rep for our class, I cannot let this situation go on\u2014Why don\u2019t you like to study? Studying is so interesting. If we don\u2019t study, what meaning is there in life? Please, believe me, and let\u2019s give each other a chance.\u201dXue Xisheng was like a Mad Dog, Jr. He Zhao wasn\u2019t sure what to do about him and he couldn\u2019t really beat him up, either. \u201cFriend, I think it\u2019s best we spare each other.\u201dXie Yu, on the other hand, was willing to be vicious, and even used the all-purpose ten-word idiom, \u201cIt\u2019s none of your business and none of my business.\u201d But Xue Xisheng wasn\u2019t affected at all and only repeated his words. \u201c43 points. That\u2019s the distance between our average and Class 1\u2019s.\u201dWith this one battle, Xue Xisheng made a name for himself, and Wan Da gave him the title \u2018The man who stands at the top of Class 3\u2019s food chain.\u2019\u201cThis is terrifying.\u201d Seeing Wan Da\u2019s reply text, Shen Jie looked up at the two gangsters who seemed to have taken root in Class 8. \u201c\u2026No wonder you two have been coming here so often recently. Big Bro Xie Yu, did you notice that our class is especially quiet lately?\u201dXie Yu was sitting in a corner, looking down at his phone. He wasn\u2019t sure how the conversation had come around to him. \u201cMe?\u201dHe Zhao was quite well-known and, after the incident of Yang Wenyuan, he had gained some positive repute in their class. Xie Yu was different; his intimidating image still remained.Shen Jie said, \u201cYes. I haven\u2019t seen you smile before. Smile a little to show you\u2019re friendly? Everyone in class is trembling.\u201dXie Yu looked up and saw that several people were indeed surreptitiously looking at him. But the moment they saw him looking in their direction, they furtively looked down again.Xie Yu was about to say, \u2018then let them tremble,\u2019 but He Zhao suddenly spoke up. \u201cWhy should my little friend smile for you?\u201dShen Jie\u2019s brain suddenly short-circuited. \u201c\u2026.Huh?\u201dXie Yu\u2019s hand stilled. The level he\u2019d been playing had been going smoothly, but now that he\u2019d stopped controlling his avatar, the figure fell into a ditch and the more than 2km of obstacles he\u2019d passed already were now all in vain.Shen Jie was very sure he hadn\u2019t heard wrong. He was about to ask, \u201cZhao-ge, are you really jealous?\u201d but He Zhao often cracked jokes and he wasn\u2019t sure how sincere this actually was. He couldn\u2019t let it go, but he also didn\u2019t want to make things awkward, so he just laughed dryly. \u201cHa ha. Look, the sun is shining. It must be very hot outside.\u201dAfter he finished speaking, he felt that things had gotten even more awkward\u2026 or, more accurately, only he was embarrassed. The atmosphere around the two people beside him seemed a little more subtle\u2026Eventually, Xie Yu stood up and did something very in line with his intimidating image. He rolled up his sleeves, pointed at He Zhao, and said, \u201cCome out.\u201dAll of Class 8 trembled.The class bell rang. Dean Jiang came looking for Old Tang and they walked out together. From the faculty office door, they could already see the two boys together. \u201cWhat are the two of you doing? Hugging?\u201dDean Jiang\u2019s voice carried down the whole corridor, especially this very suggestive word \u2018hugging.\u2019 The students in the window seats of all the classes, 1 through 8, simultaneously turned and looked out the window.Xie Yu was still gripping He Zhao\u2019s collar, and He Zhao\u2019s hand lay lightly on Xie Yu\u2019s waist.Everyone: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe last class on Friday was literature.Tang Sen finished his lecture, closed his textbook, and gave a reminder. \u201cThat\u2019s all the homework for this weekend. Don\u2019t go nuts playing now that it\u2019s the weekend\u2026 Live-in students, will you go home over the weekend? If you\u2019re planning to stay in school, come here and put your name down.\u201dXie Yu had slept on his desk all through class. Unwilling to go up alone, He Zhao poked his deskmate\u2019s shoulder with a pen. \u201cAre you going home for the weekend? Are you still mad?\u201dXie Yu turned to him. \u201cI held myself back from punching you. Don\u2019t offer yourself up.\u201dHe Zhao said, \u201cYou haven\u2019t answered my question.\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m going back,\u201d Xie Yu said. \u201cIt\u2019s my mom\u2019s birthday. I have to go home this weekend.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Everyone in class knew that He Zhao didn\u2019t do his homework, so he plucked up the courage to ask, \u201cAre you going to do the homework?\u201dHe Zhao said as he copied, \u201cJust in case. Maybe? We\u2019ll see what fate decrees. Maybe the homework from one class will look especially pleasing. When fate comes knocking, we can\u2019t stop it.\u201dThis was probably the first time the guy had heard such a seemingly serious discussion of \u2018one\u2019s compatibility with homework,\u2019 so he sighed and let it go.He Zhao copied it out twice and returned the notebook to the guy, then put one set on Xie Yu\u2019s desk. \u201cTake it. Maybe a miracle will happen.\u201dXie Yu glanced down at the dogshit illegible handwriting and thought, I can\u2019t even read this. If a miracle happens, there really are supernatural forces in the world.He stacked the papers together. There was no immediate place to toss it, so he stuffed it into his pocket. Then he heard He Zhao ask, \u201cWhen is your birthday?\u201dXie Yu turned away; the sight of He Zhao vexed him, the hallway incident still a lingering shadow. A row of windows, and a neat row of heads sticking out and looking at them, expressions subtly stunned.Wan Da had even covered his eyes, like it was an unbecoming sight.He\u2019d lived all this time and never had unflattering rumors passed around about him, but after meeting He Zhao he discovered that this world really was vast.\u201cStudents staying in school over the weekend, please follow the dorm rules strictly.\u201d Tang Sen found a chair and sat down. It looked like he was about to chat with them until school let out. \u201cWe must believe in science. Last weekend\u2019s incident, I almost forgot\u2014Wan Da, don\u2019t look down\u2014I really couldn\u2019t tell that you had these thoughts.\u201dSettling the bill after the fact.Their Mr. Tang had a very long memory.Sometimes one believed he had really let it go. He\u2019d wait until they had let down their guard and felt that the incident had passed. When the winds and water were both calm and the days passed peacefully, one would be grabbed by Mr. Tang for a lecture. \u201cAh, last month you\u2014\u201d\u201cWill you die if you spit it out?\u201d He Zhao turned to look at Xie Yu and bent down to be on the same level as him. He reached out, thinking of touching his hair. \u201cWhen\u2019s your birthday?\u201dXie Yu said, \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll die.\u201dHe Zhao didn\u2019t keep pressing. Not even a few minutes later, the question turned from birthdays to, \u201cWhich year were you born? You\u2019re definitely smaller\u00b9 than me.\u201dXie Yu was currently very sensitive to the word \u2018small,\u2019 for instance, He Zhao\u2019s use of \u2018little friend.\u2019So Xie Yu sat up, face dark, and retorted, \u201cHow am I small? Which fucking part of me is small?\u201dSo the two compared their birth years; He Zhao was older than him by two whole years.\u201cCall me big bro,\u201d He Zhao said, smiling. \u201cI said you were smaller and you didn\u2019t believe me.\u201dXie Yu kept having the feeling that He Zhao was setting traps for him.He Zhao put his legs up and leaned back. Under him, the front legs of his chair lifted off the ground. His posture was languid, and his center of gravity was shifted backward so that he looked unsteady.He Zhao looked up and ahead, gaze passing through the backs of his classmates\u2019 heads and landing on the blackboard with several lines of neat writing. Tang Sen\u2019s voice reciting the lesson suddenly grew far away.After a beat, Xie Yu heard He Zhao say lightly, \u201cYou had to be younger than me. I repeated ninth grade.\u201dXie Yu\u2019s first reaction was: No wonder no one said he cheated, going to high school with these grades.Last year, Xie Yu\u2019s cheating story had spread through the whole year but He Zhao hadn\u2019t encountered a peep at all.So He Zhao had repeated the year.That would explain it. A slacker whose grades sucked\u2014repeating a year plus dogshit luck\u2014that\u2019s how he\u2019d touched the tail of high school.\u00b2Xie Yu looked at He Zhao\u2019s languid posture and twisted the pen in his hands, his fingers spinning it in circles.He Zhao\u2019s 10-point math exam still lay on his desk. He had done his corrections, but he had done them two lines at a time before zoning out for a little while, and on top of his sloppy writing, the whole picture was messy.Xie Yu was curious. \u201cHow many years did you repeat?\u201dHe Zhao said, \u201cOne. What about it?\u201dXie Yu said, \u201cNothing. I thought that the way you are you might have repeated three.\u201dHe Zhao was irked by these words. \u201cWhat do you mean, the way I am? Aren\u2019t you the same? Mr. Second-from-last, can you look at your own grades before talking?\u201dThe dismissal bell rang as they were speaking.Everyone cheered, and Wan Da stood on his chair and waved his exam paper. \u201cWe\u2019re free! We\u2019re free, comrades!\u201dTang Sen cut off mid-lecture, shook his head, stood up, and left one last line: \u201cStudent on duty today, please clean the classroom before leaving.\u201dXie Yu didn\u2019t have many things to pack up and He Zhao was staying in school over the weekend so he stayed in his chair and kept rocking. He even leaned back and waved: \u201cLittle friend, bye-bye.\u201dXie Yu didn\u2019t reply. As he passed behind He Zhao, he kicked him, simple and clean. \u201cCall me that one more time and see what happens.\u201dHe Zhao instantly lost his balance. Seeing he was about to fall backward, chair and all, he fortunately reacted quickly and fell with the most suave posture possible. He flung out one hand toward the ground to support his weight. \u201cFuck it.\u201dThe chair fell alongside him, crashing into the floor with a loud bang.Wan Da waved the exam paper for a while, then on impulse, folded it into a paper airplane, put it to his mouth and blew on it. \u201c\u2014Go forth! Fly free, little bird.\u201dLiu Cunhao saw him, and folded up the math paper on the desk. \u201cDa-da, I\u2019ll show you an even more formidable one.\u201dTang Sen had only gotten to the door and the class was already in an uproar. He put both hands behind his back, holding his medicinal herbal tea, and said thoughtfully, \u201cYoung people really are hot-blooded.\u201dXie Yu didn\u2019t take anything with him. He was just going home to sleep for two nights before coming back to school.Gu Xuelan, on the other hand, was attentive. \u201cJust bring a bag and your homework with you. We have everything else at home.\u201d\u201cGot it. I know what to do.\u201d All Xie Yu had on him, aside from his phone and some money, was the miracle assignment note he had forgotten to throw out.After leaving the school gates and making sure there wasn\u2019t a Zhong-family chauffeur waiting in a luxury car at the gates, Xie Yu walked toward the bus station.\u201cIt\u2019s so hot but you refused to let anyone come get you and insisted on crowding with people under the hot sun,\u201d Gu Xuelan said. \u201cBe careful on the road.\u201dXie Yu made a noise of acknowledgement and hung up.Xie Yu didn\u2019t have many feelings on the subject of birthdays. In his recollections, there were no birthday cakes, happy surprises, or scares. It wasn\u2019t much of an event.There had only been a bowl of piping hot noodles.To save money, Madam Gu didn\u2019t celebrate her own birthday, but every year on Xie Yu\u2019s birthday Madam Gu would cook him a bowl of noodles.After eating it, he\u2019d feel warm all over. He couldn\u2019t say why, but he felt that it warmed him.Zhong Jie, on the other hand, came back on weekends. In university, he either stayed in school or accompanied Zhong Guofei to the office as an assistant. Very soon, he would take over the company.Xie Yu had been in the Zhong family for three years and hadn\u2019t stirred up anything. He was quiet, and everyone understood that he was a mediocre individual who could not be lifted up. Zhong Jie disliked him, but was also secretly somewhat thrilled.The moment Xie Yu stepped through the door, Zhong Jie asked in an odd way, \u201cI heard you did quite well on your exams this month?\u201dXie Yu changed his shoes, one hand supporting his weight against the shoe rack. He looked down so his expression couldn\u2019t be made out. \u201cThat\u2019s too much praise.\u201dGu Xuelan walked out of the living room. She knew her son was coming back today and Zhong Jie was there, too, so she had done the cooking herself and made many dishes. \u201cFood is ready. Quick, come over and eat.\u201dZhong Jie sat on the sofa and sneered. Who knew what he was laughing about.Maybe it was He Zhao\u2019s influence, but Xie Yu found that his temper had gotten much better. Under this situation of \u2018you\u2019re angry, but I\u2019m not,\u2019 this meal actually passed in peace.And Zhong Jie found that Xie Yu had become much harder to antagonize. He had gone from \u2018exploding at a touch, retaliating with cold words\u2019 to \u2018ignoring him and treating him like air.\u2019After the meal, Gu Xuelan took Xie Yu to make several plates of fruit for him to bring upstairs for them to eat.Xie Yu washed the fruits with her. The two of them crowded in the kitchen and the water splashing on his hands was cold.They didn\u2019t talk much. A question here, an answer there, and then they sank into silence.Xie Yu washed the last apple and handed it to Madam Gu.\u201cBring this plate up to your Uncle Zhong,\u201d Gu Xuelan said. \u201cHe\u2019s been especially busy with company matters for a few days. After coming back, he only eats a few mouthfuls before going to the study.\u201dZhong Jie was also in the study on the second floor. When Xie Yu got to the doorway, he heard heated quarrelling inside\u2014especially Zhong Guofei\u2019s somewhat muffled helpless and frustrated voice.\u201cI do everything for your sake, but what about you?! Can you spare a thought for me? Your Aunt Gu spends her days with me and I\u2019m very grateful to her.\u201dThen came Zhong Jie\u2019s hoarse words: \u201cThen what about my mother\u2014?! Where has she gone? In this household, what is she, and what am I?!\u201dThis topic again. Who knew how it had come up again. Three years and it still went on.Xie Yu thought their conversation noisy. He looked down, speared a small piece of apple with a toothpick, and put it in his mouth. It tasted a little sour.Gu Xuelan heard the sounds of quarrelling from upstairs. She didn\u2019t even wait to wipe off her hands before heading upstairs to mediate the fight.\u201cDon\u2019t go.\u201d Xie Yu stood in the doorway to the study, the plate of fruit in one hand, the other holding Gu Xuelan\u2019s arm. \u201cLet them fight. Let them fight all they want.\u201dHow could Gu Xuelan just leave it be? She hurriedly pushed open the door and went in.It would be another night without peace.Xie Yu stood under the showerhead, soaked to the skin. He closed his eyes and tried to ignore the noise from outside.He lifted a hand and wiped his face, then turned off the water, pulled open the shower door and walked out. Water slid down his hair and over his back then landed on the tiled floor. The refraction of light from the warm bulb overhead gave it a splash of color.Before tossing his dirty clothes in the laundry hamper, Xie Yu went through his pockets for anything he had forgotten out of habit. He touched a piece of paper folded into a square.On it was He Zhao\u2019s higgledy-piggledy scrawl, as if the pen nib was about to fly off. Words he\u2019d never be able to find in the wild.Xie Yu looked at it for a long time and couldn\u2019t make out a single word.He flipped the piece of paper over and discovered a smiley face drawn on the back. The curved mouth tailed off in an upward stroke and looked rather rascally.Xie Yu looked a moment longer, then leaned against the wall beside the bathtub and smiled.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 57": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fake SlackersChapter 035 - Someone who'll do your homework for you, got it?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayFake SlackersTranslator: JuryEditor: NomNomFirst Published on Chaleuria\u2014035 \u2013 Someone who\u2019ll do your homework for you, got it?Xie Yu himself didn\u2019t notice that the frustration and annoyance was disappearing from his body little by little.He folded the note up again. The trash can was just beside him; he hesitated for two seconds but didn\u2019t toss it.There was something special about He Zhao.His careless, casual attitude highlighted his colorful presence.His grades were so bad it made people\u2019s hair stand on end, and all the teachers got headaches just looking at him and weren\u2019t sure whether to laugh or cry. Even so, after class, Wu Zheng would occasionally look for He Zhao to play soccer. \u201cYou, what did you say during math class? Come to the courtyard at noon and I\u2019ll teach you a lesson.\u201dThis didn\u2019t have anything to do with Xie Yu but he was implicated every time He Zhao was reprimanded by name.Wu Zheng then pointed at Xie Yu. \u201cYou come, too.\u201dSo, at noon, after eating lunch, He Zhao dragged Xie Yu to the courtyard. Wan Da, Luo Wenqiang, and the others also came to make up numbers.Wu Zheng\u2019s team was well-populated. Aside from Old Tang and the history teacher from next door, even Dean Jiang was there.Wu Zheng was talented at throwing chalk, but his soccer skills weren\u2019t up to par. He sat in the office every day and didn\u2019t exercise, after all, and he was getting on in years, so his physical skills couldn\u2019t be compared to that of a young person.\u201cLet\u2019s do this\u2014in a bit, let\u2019s play badly.\u201d During half-time, He Zhao lowered his voice. \u201cLet Mad Dog and the others score a few more goals.\u201dWan Da said, \u201cZhao-ge, that\u2019s a tall order. Their skills really are terrible. I\u2019m not like you. This is too difficult of an act and I don\u2019t think I can do it.\u201dHe Zhao squatted and patted Wan Da\u2019s head. \u201cDifficult, my ass. I\u2019ll teach you. When he\u2019s trying to score, do this\u2026 kneel down, got it? Then look very frustrated and punch the ground to show your deep regret at making a mistake on the soccer field\u2026\u201dWan Da was a little stunned. \u201cBut that\u2019s so exaggerated?\u201d\u201cIf you want to act, then do it yourself,\u201d Xie Yu said as he squatted at the side, a bottle of water in his hand. He capped it. \u201cDon\u2019t drag other people into it.\u201d\u201cThis needs everyone\u2019s cooperation,\u201d He Zhao said. \u201cAnd you\u2019re not other people. You\u2019re my deskmate.\u201dBefore Xie Yu could reply, Luo Wenqiang was the first to stand up and refuse to cooperate. \u201cPlaying fake ball goes severely against the spirit of P.E.! I won\u2019t agree to this!\u201dHe Zhao: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dOut of respect for Old Wu\u2019s soccer experience, they let him off. Wan Da took a leaf from He Zhao\u2019s book and even did the fake fall. But Luo Wenqiang would rather die than play badly, so He Zhao took the script for \u2018Worst Teammate\u2019 and did his best to suffocate Contestant Luo Wenqiang\u2019s performance.Luo Wenqiang was in true pain. \u201cZhao-ge, what on earth are you doing? Which team are you on? \u2026Yu-ge, do something about him.\u201dXie Yu: \u201cWhy me? It\u2019s none of my business.\u201dWu Zheng and the others had a great time playing ball. They were energized and invigorated, and felt like they were 18 again.They even made plans for the next game.The noise in the study gradually grew fainter.After listening to them fight for so long, Xie Yu had gotten the gist of it. In summary, Zhong Guofei had accidentally knocked to the ground a fountain pen Zhong Jie had received from his mother when he was young. The pen had broken and could no longer write.And the problem which had remained unsolved for three years now exploded again.Zhong Guofei thought that Zhong Jie was grown up now, so why was he still kicking up a fuss?\u201cBoth of you calm down. There\u2019s no point keeping on like this.\u201d Gu Xuelan followed them out of the study.Zhong Jie walked toward the door with the car keys in his hand. \u201cCalm down? I\u2019m very calm.\u201dZhong Guofei was also angry. When Zhong Jie had lost his temper, he\u2019d said many terrible things to him. But he still stood in the stairwell and said, \u201cCome back. Where are you going? Where are you going to live if not at home?\u201dZhong Jie didn\u2019t even look back. Clearly, he was going to become a good-for-nothing bar-dweller who smelled of alcohol and loneliness.There was no point in Xie Yu being at home. After meals he just went back to his room, sometimes to play games with Dalei.Like that message Wan Da had sent when he got home: Got home. Salted fish. Like I\u2019m drunk and dreaming.\u00b9\u201cDon\u2019t go over there! Help me out, will you?\u201d Zhou Dalei was familiar with Xie Yu\u2019s piss-poor attitude to online gaming. He\u2019d never met a gamer more suited to solo play than Xie Yu. But knowing was one thing; after so many years, he still hadn\u2019t gotten accustomed to it. \u201cBoss Xie, do you see that I\u2019m about to die? It\u2019s not you getting hit, so you don\u2019t feel the pain, do you? Ah, fuck, game over, game over.\u201dXie Yu was unmoved. \u201cYou\u2019re terrible at this.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m terrible at this?\u201d Zhou Dalei said in a joking voice. \u201cWho am I doing all this for? Who else would tolerate a teammate who\u2019s more cruel than an enemy, huh?!Xie Yu played two rounds, glanced at the time, and said, \u201cYou go on. I\u2019m going offline.\u201dZhou Dalei felt like he\u2019d forgotten something. Only when Xie Yu said he was going offline did he hit his forehead and remember. \u201cIt\u2019s Aunt Lan\u2019s birthday today, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cI almost forgot. Give my well-wishes to Aunt Lan for me\u2014say I hope she gets more and more beautiful and that all things go as she wishes,\u201d Dalei said, then complained, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you remind me?\u201dThe guests downstairs still hadn\u2019t left.Although Madam Gu had made it very clear that she didn\u2019t want any special birthday celebration, many people still trickled into the house and gifts piled up on the table.Zhong Guofei held a high position in the business world. Although no one thought very well of Mrs. Zhong, they still presented the appropriate gifts.\u201cWhat for?\u201d Xie Yu turned off the game and put one leg up on the edge of his chair. After staring at the computer for so long, he was a little tired. \u201cAre you going to give plastic flowers again?\u201dZhou Dalei said, \u201cDon\u2019t look down on plastic flowers. They\u2019re fake, but they will never wilt. All my gifts are very practical.\u201d\u201cGiving a scarf in the middle of summer is practical?\u201dZhou Dalei would not admit his gift-giving skills were lacking. He tried to explain himself: \u201c\u2026Winter will come sooner or later.\u201d\u201cDo I still have to compliment you?\u201dBy six or seven in the evening, the visitors had mostly left.The house finally quieted. The maid put away the fruit plates, mopped the floor, and wiped down the tables. Zhong Guofei saw the visitors out.Gu Xuelan was tired. She was about to go upstairs but when she passed by the kitchen she saw Xie Yu inside, an apron around his waist, his sleeves folded up. He was holding a handful of vegetables, washing them carefully under the tap.The water in the pot had just begun to boil and emitted steam. Xie Yu reached out and opened the lid, then put some noodles in. He did this with the ease of practice, without any dawdling.Xie Yu wasn\u2019t a stranger to the kitchen. Before, when Gu Xuelan had been busy with work and hadn\u2019t had the time to take care of him, he had cooked for himself on days he didn\u2019t go to Aunt Lei or Aunt Mei\u2019s houses for dinner. A simple bowl of noodles or fried rice.Gu Xuelan didn\u2019t make a sound. She stood in the kitchen doorway and watched.He made a very simple bowl of noodles. Green vegetables, a sprinkle of spring onion, and a fried egg.He kept his head bowed, eyes attentive.Gu Xuelan\u2019s eyes filled with tears as she watched him. She turned around and covered her eyes with one hand.Xie Yu didn\u2019t say much. Madam Gu finished the noodles one bite at a time, and only then did he say, \u201cHappy birthday, mom.\u201dGu Xuelan nodded and made a soft noise of acknowledgement.She couldn\u2019t think of anything coy to say, either. In the end, she only replied, \u201cIt\u2019s getting late. Get some sleep. You still have to go to class tomorrow.\u201dTomorrow was Monday again. Xie Yu lay on the bed and was about to turn off his phone when the notification bar flashed with two messages. The timing was just right.It came from QQ friend \u2018He Zhao.\u2019Old Xie, I found something good.Add Weixin 1502xxx7043, he\u2019ll do your homework for you.Xie Yu\u2019s finger stilled on the screen. A second passed before he typed a question mark: ?He Zhao: From our year. He specializes in doing your homework for you.He Zhao: Shen Jie said this person is very capable. His prices are fair and he can even imitate your handwriting. He\u2019s so good at it even Dean Jiang can\u2019t tell.He Zhao: And if he gets one wrong, he\u2019ll do ten to make it up.Xie Yu: So?Xie Yu felt that his knowledge of being a slacker was still too limited. He simply wasn\u2019t good enough.Tell you via call. Is this a good time?Although Xie Yu wasn\u2019t interested, he still mustered up enough energy to reply, sure.The next second, He Zhao sent an invitation.Xie Yu didn\u2019t look carefully at it and thought it was a normal voice call.So, when he hit accept, He Zhao appeared in the middle of the screen wearing only a pair of underpants.He Zhao hadn\u2019t even toweled his hair. He stood barefoot on the ground, bent over by his bed going through his clothes. His shoulder blades and spine were drawn tight by the movement, and the red string still hung around his neck. The vigor only a youth could possess radiated from him.Xie Yu was silent for two seconds, then said, \u201cWhat are you doing? Showing off your damn black underwear?\u201d\u201cFuck.\u201d He Zhao jumped, too. He picked up his clothes and looked back. \u201c\u2026What the hell.\u201dHe Zhao had been busy putting on clothes and had accidentally hit the video call button instead.The lighting on Xie Yu\u2019s side wasn\u2019t good\u2014a little dark\u2014but by the looks of it he was lying on his bed. He Zhao put on shirt and pants in a few swift movements. \u201cHand slipped. Hey, don\u2019t look like that. Clearly you\u2019re the one who benefited here. Your big bro\u2019s body\u2026\u201d\u201cIf nothing\u2019s the matter, I\u2019m hanging up.\u201dHe Zhao stopped bragging about his body. \u201cThere was something. Right. The homework person.\u201dXie Yu wasn\u2019t sure why He Zhao had to talk one-on-one with him about someone who did homework for others. He asked, \u201cDoes he give a twenty percent discount for doing two sets of homework?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d He Zhao said. \u201cDo you still have the piece of paper I gave you? What homework is there? Even I can\u2019t tell what on earth I wrote on here.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dXie Yu \u2018greeted\u2019 He Zhao calmly, with no trace of profanity. The general gist was to tell him to go somewhere cool. Then he prepared to cut the video call.\u201cJust try it! Maybe you and my handwriting have a special connection.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019d better ask the homework guy if he and your handwriting have a special connection,\u201d Xie Yu said. \u201cCan he imitate this mess of yours?\u201dXie Yu finished speaking and immediately hit end call. His phone screen returned to the home screen, where the icon of the Apple of Knowledge\u2014he had forgotten to delete it\u2014still lay quietly in the \u2018Games\u2019 folder. The patch of green was very eye-catching.Before he knew it, night had fully fallen outside his window. Wind rushed in through the window from outside, bringing with it a touch of cold.Xie Yu shut his eyes and his consciousness grew fainter. But he was somehow aware that summer was about to pass.That hot and suffocating summer, when Zhou Dalei yelled through the phone, \u201cF\u2013king damn it stealing my violet weapon,\u201d when He Zhao had pulled aside his black mask and smiled as he said, \u201cI\u2019m mixed blood from eight countries,\u201d was about to pass.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 58": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fake SlackersChapter 036 - Yu-ge, you've changed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayFake SlackersTranslator: JuryEditor: NomNomFirst Published on Chaleuria\u2014036 \u2013 Yu-ge, you\u2019ve changed.Xie Yu got up early. He changed into his school uniform and had a breakfast of congee and vegetables with Madam Gu. Then he glanced at the time and got ready to take the bus back to school. \u201cI\u2019m leaving. If anything happens, call me.\u201dGu Xuelan put down her chopsticks, got up, and said, \u201cLet the driver send you back.\u201dXie Yu walked to the entryway and bent down to change his shoes. He hadn\u2019t brought anything back with him, and now he didn\u2019t take anything with him either. He didn\u2019t look like he was going back to school, but instead, going out to play. \u201cNo need. I\u2019ll go back on my own.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re going just like that? You\u2019re not even taking a backpack?\u201d Gu Xuelan wasn\u2019t sure what to say to him. \u201cDid you do the homework your teachers assigned this weekend?\u201dXie Yu said, \u201cI\u2019ve done it. I did it in school.\u201dThis excuse was too fishy. There was no way Gu Xuelan would have believed it. \u201cI think you didn\u2019t do it at all.\u201d\u201cThere weren\u2019t many questions I could do, anyway.\u201d Xie Yu placed his slippers neatly to the side, pulled open the door, and went out. A gust of humid wind blew in from outside, brushing past his face. \u201cIt\u2019s the same whether I submit it or not.\u201dGu Xuelan was about to say, \u201cIt\u2019s getting cold, take care of yourself,\u201d but Xie Yu had already walked out.The Zhong family\u2019s house was in a rather remote location and it was half an hour\u2019s walk to the nearest bus station.A family on a morning jog was currently running laps in the nearby park. Towels hung around their necks and they panted as they ran.Actually, not everything here was a source of frustration.For instance, the glow of dawn that rose from the horizon, or the trees and blades of grass he had passed on the way here. Or the couple in front of him, running with their children; they had deliberately slowed their steps and looked like a slow-motion replay of a recording.Xie Yu put in his earphones as he walked and put a song on, then stuck his hands back in his pockets.Fresh air and a new day.The time it took for Xie Yu to get back to school was determined by how smooth the bus was running. Sometimes, he was more unlucky\u2014this time, for example, the bus broke down on the way.The driver smoked a cigarette, examining the bus for a long time before he patted it with a hand. \u201cNo can do. You all wait for the next one.\u201dThe busful of passengers exploded.Little friend, what time are you getting back to school?What do you wantDid you miss me? I\u2019ll come meet you at the school gatesAre you sick?Can we just have a proper conversation? Thank goodness I have a good temper\u2026 ah, when you get to school later don\u2019t rush to class. I\u2019ll wait for you in the bathroom.He Zhao had probably gotten to the classroom early and had nothing better to do than bother him.Xie Yu chatted on and off with him for a while; one of them wanted nothing more than to end the conversation while the other did their best to revive the dying tree.\u00b9The next bus arrived quickly. It stopped with a shudder, the \u201891\u2019 plate indicating its route hanging in the glass window.When Xie Yu got to school, there were still ten minutes before class began; he wasn\u2019t late yet. Mad Dog couldn\u2019t do anything to him and could only glare from the school gates. \u201cHurry up! Start running! Every second counts!\u201dMad Dog continued, \u201cYou don\u2019t know how to use your time well at all! You\u2019re almost in year three, do you think this is your first day? \u2026Remember to ask your deskmate. At first, he\u2019d try to climb the wall every morning, and every morning I\u2019d catch him. I would just wait by the wall.\u201dXie Yu maintained the same pace and walked past Dean Jiang, neither quickly nor slowly. He was not that interested in listening to Mad Dog\u2019s war stories. \u201cSorry for the disturbance. Goodbye, Dean Jiang.\u201dXie Yu went upstairs and saw someone walking to and fro in the corridor outside Class 2.3. Wan Da had his head stuck out the window, looking out with one hand on the windowsill. Xie Yu wasn\u2019t bothered and was about to walk over when someone grabbed his wrist from behind and dragged him in the opposite direction.Xie Yu hadn\u2019t been prepared. He took two steps backwards and was dragged along, and by the time he realized what was happening, he had already been pulled into a stall in the boys\u2019 bathroom.\u201cI told you not to go to class.\u201d He Zhao let go. Two people in a stall was really a little cramped and they were very close together. \u201cDidn\u2019t you see the class rep hanging around the corridor?\u201dHe Zhao wore a light jacket over his school uniform. It was a loose vest, black, a sharply drawn set of wings on the back. His white uniform shirt stuck out past the bottom of the vest.Xie Yu had not taken He Zhao\u2019s words, \u2018I\u2019ll wait for you in the toilet,\u2019 to heart at all. \u201cWhat\u2019s he hanging around there for?\u201d\u201cHe said he\u2019d explain trigonometric functions to us.\u201d He Zhao scratched his head and said helplessly, \u201c\u2026The moment I stepped into class this morning he started reciting formulas at me.\u201dXie Yu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe Zhao: \u201cDidn\u2019t expect that, did you? I\u2019m really impressed. He\u2019ll definitely do great things in the future.\u201dOver the weekend, Xie Yu had almost forgotten that there was someone in class trying madly to save the class average.Xue Xisheng\u2019s focus and endurance was far beyond that of an ordinary person\u2019s. Just look at the post-it notes all over his desk, and the reference books stacked in his drawer, on the desk, on the floor, and even in a corner of the classroom because he had nowhere else to put them.For the past two days, aside from finishing his own homework, Xue Xisheng had been thinking about how to lead everyone to study well.The two of them had been squashed in the toilet stall for a while and Xie Yu was starting to find this very stupid. Why were they hiding in a toilet stall so early in the morning? Listening to Xue Xisheng recite formulas might be more exciting.So the two of them started quarrelling.\u201cYou can\u2019t abandon me here.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t block the door.\u201d\u201cOld Xie, if you walk out this door, we\u2019re not brothers any more.\u201d\u201cWe never were.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWhen the bell was about to ring for class, the student on duty carried a cloth and a bucket to the bathroom. After cleaning it, he turned off the tap and wrung out the cloth, and was about to walk out when he heard a faint noise from a toilet stall, so he stopped and glanced around.In the stall.He Zhao\u2019s back was to the door, blocking it so Xie Yu couldn\u2019t open it.Xie Yu\u2019s arm went around He Zhao\u2019s waist and went for the door handle; he had just twisted it open when He Zhao pushed him inward again.The two forces opposed each other, and although the range of movement wasn\u2019t large, when Xie Yu stepped back he accidentally kicked the trash can and the whole thing overturned and crashed onto the ground.He Zhao was worried he\u2019d fall and reached out to catch him.Xie Yu\u2019s balance had been fine, but now that He Zhao had pulled him, he fell backwards. \u201c\u2026Fuck.\u201dThe student on duty probably hadn\u2019t looked at his horoscope for the day or he\u2019d definitely have found the words, \u2018you\u2019ll have bad luck in the bathroom.\u2019The door of the last stall slowly opened and he saw, very clearly, Xie Yu slumped on the toilet seat and He Zhao bent at the waist with one hand on his neck.Their positions were really quite suggestive.\u201cI, I\u2026 didn\u2019t see anything\u2026\u201d The student on duty walked backwards out the door. \u201cI really didn\u2019t see anything.\u201dXie Yu maintained a chilly expression and said nothing.He Zhao straightened. \u201cHey, friend.\u201dThe student on duty was probably shell-shocked because he even said as he retreated, \u201cDon\u2019t kill me.\u201dGood news doesn\u2019t get past the front door; news of a gay affair spreads a thousand miles.\u00b2At the end of the first period, Wan Da came over to ask, \u201cSo what were you two doing in the toilet this morning?\u201d\u201cDoing nothing.\u201d Xie Yu finished copying his homework and said, \u201cAre you itching for a beating today?\u201dWan Da said, \u201cI\u2019m mischievous, but not itchy.\u201d \u00b3He Zhao saw Xue Xisheng follow Tang Sen out and lowered his guard then joined in the great conversation. \u201cNews spreads so fast?\u201d\u201cMy elementary school classmate\u2019s classmate from last year is a good friend of the next door\u2019s class chair\u2019s cousin.\u201d Wan Da finished reporting his grapevine\u2019s points of contact, then asked, \u201cBut back to the topic. Zhao-ge, you really stripped Yu-ge of his clothes?\u201dXie Yu put the cap of his pen back on and finally looked up. He stared intently at Wan Da. \u201cWhat?\u201dWan Da couldn\u2019t tell if Xie Yu\u2019s expression was a little upset or very upset. After thinking on it a little, he concluded that he wasn\u2019t in that much danger. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the initial version of the story was, but by the time it got to me, that\u2019s what they said. The two of you had a terrible fight in the toilet and your clothes were in disarray\u2026 anyway, it was very exciting.\u201dRumors\u2026 one person spread it to ten, who spread it to a hundred, and could create chaos out of nothing.Wan Da asked, \u201cIs it true? Come, come closer and say it quietly. I promise I won\u2019t say a word.\u201dXie Yu moved his chair back; he had no interest in dealing with this.He Zhao, on the other hand, secretively leaned closer. \u201cDo you want to know?\u201dWan Da: \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cActually, that isn\u2019t all we did,\u201d He Zhao said. \u201cWe did things that are even more thrilling\u2026\u201dWan Da narrowed his eyes craftily, now attentive. \u201cOh?\u201dTaking advantage of Wan Da\u2019s moment of weakness, He Zhao calmly rolled up a student newspaper by his hand and knocked Wan Da\u2019s head with it. \u201cYou\u2014even\u2014dare\u2014spread rumors\u2014about me! I gave you freedom and you let it get to your head?\u201d \u2074Wan Da seemed to have been knocked stupid. He held his head, looking tearfully at Xie Yu, and written across his face was: Your deskmate\u2019s bullying me.Xie Yu was initially frustrated, but seeing them horsing around like this he didn\u2019t feel the need to quibble further.\u201cHow can you,\u201d Xie Yu began, and Wan Da nodded furiously, barely restraining himself from yelling, \u2018From today on, you\u2019re my real bro.\u2019 But then Xie Yu picked up an English textbook and continued, \u201c\u2026how can you use newspaper? It\u2019s so light. You playing around?\u201dHe Zhao laughed out loud.Wan Da looked at the thick English book, turned, and ran. He felt very aggrieved: You\u2019ve changed, Yu-ge, you\u2019ve changed\u2026Midday break.Luo Wenqiang, hoping for the stars and the moon, had impatiently waited for Erzhong\u2019s official autumn sports meet. He finally got the signup form from Tang Sen\u2019s office, returned to class, and yelled enthusiastically, \u201cClassmates, I want to announce something!\u201dWan Da and Liu Cunhao stood in front of him, fighting to imitate Old Tang. They talked slowly and actually did quite a good impersonation. \u201cFor the autumn sports meet, Luo Wenqiang, you make the groups\u2026 make sure everyone enthusiastically signs up to showcase our class spirit.\u201dLuo Wenqiang had been interrupted and now he stood on the stage awkwardly. \u201cWhy are the two of you like this? Trying to put me out of a job?\u201dThe classroom was noisy.Xie Yu lay on his desk, shut his eyes, and rested. He had been staring at his phone all morning and now his eyes were tired.He Zhao thought his deskmate was asleep. Xie Yu, lying down, felt something warm touch his right ear; it closed over his ear and shut out the sound of Luo Wenqiang and the others talking.\u2014It was He Zhao\u2019s hand.Then he heard He Zhao shush them. \u201cMy deskmate is sleeping. Be quiet.\u201dActually, Xie Yu wasn\u2019t the only one lying down. Several girls in the row in front were also sleeping and thought it noisy but didn\u2019t want to say anything.Xie Yu moved his fingers and thought about opening his eyes, but he kept the same posture and didn\u2019t move.He hadn\u2019t been sleepy at all, but now that he had closed his eyes\u2026 he really ended up falling asleep.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I got too excited there. Let\u2019s talk during gym class, then. If you want to participate, just come find me anytime.\u201dXie Yu was a light sleeper. He heard someone talking, but he wasn\u2019t listening closely.Right before class started, Wu Zheng passed by their classroom and handed the homework to the class rep, who distributed it to the class. He was very energetic about handing out the papers, and even though people asked if they could help, he didn\u2019t let them.\u201cXie, Xie Yu\u2026\u201d The class rep read out the name, then looked up and locked eyes with his target.The next second, an exercise book crash-landed next to Xie Yu\u2019s head.Xie Yu opened his eyes.The class rep made a \u2018Sorry\u2019 hand motion. Xie Yu didn\u2019t say anything and didn\u2019t look at the exercise book before stuffing it into the desk drawer.He Zhao was looking down at his phone to the side. He was wearing his earphones in, the cord winding out from his pocket.When the class rep got to He Zhao, he called out, \u201cZhao-ge!\u201dHe Zhao obligingly raised his hand to catch the \u2018ball.\u2019 After he caught it, he exclaimed in English: \u201cWo-ow, nice.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re awake?\u201d After catching the exercise book, He Zhao turned to Xie Yu and asked, \u201c\u2026Where\u2019s your homework?\u201dXie Yu said, \u201cWhat do you need it for?\u201dHe Zhao was good at taking what he wanted, and now he leaned right over to Xie Yu\u2019s side of the desk and looked in the desk drawer. \u201cJust taking a look.\u201dXie Yu didn\u2019t stop him and didn\u2019t hit his head with anything. He took the exercise book and slammed it onto the desk. \u201cTake it and admire it and scram.\u201dOn both his and He Zhao\u2019s exercise books, from start to finish, there weren\u2019t many big red checkmarks.He Zhao flipped to the questions from this weekend and verified that Xie Yu hadn\u2019t done a single one right, either, then contentedly closed it and put it back for him. \u201cWhen I see how you\u2019re doing I feel reassured.\u201dXie Yu was still lying down, half his face obscured with his sleeve so that only his eyes showed. The warm breath he exhaled landed on the fabric of his sleeve, and he looked like a little animal that one wanted to reach out and pet. Of course, before one did so, they\u2019d have to prepare to die. \u201cWhat\u2019s up with that?\u201dHe Zhao pointed at a line of text on the blackboard: Wu Zheng\u2019s writing, neat and boisterous.\u2014The two students who got everything wrong, go to the office during gym class. Be there or else.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIt happened when you were sleeping.\u201d In the end, He Zhao couldn\u2019t resist reaching out and ruffling Xie Yu\u2019s hair. \u201cLife\u2019s like that. An endless amount of surprises.\u201dXie Yu didn\u2019t really mind and made a noise of assent. Really, he still seemed quite cold: from his expression to his voice, he was, all 360 degrees of him, cold. But He Zhao thought he must have been possessed\u2014or perhaps it was just that Xie Yu\u2019s hair was so soft. He actually thought that the emotionless killer, when he had just woken up, was just a little bit cute.He Zhao continued, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m here for you.\u201dAt this point Xie Yu couldn\u2019t continue agreeing.The notice stayed on the blackboard through the next two class periods. Even though it didn\u2019t mention their names directly, everyone knew who it referred to.Wan Da was excited. \u201cShall we make a bet?\u201dLiu Cunhao said, \u201cDo we need to bet on this? \u2018The two students\u2026\u2019 who else would it be?\u201dXu Qingqing: \u201cCan you find a third person in our class who gets all the homework wrong?\u201dXie Yu glanced at He Zhao\u2019s exercise book and found that he had just copied the question, then wrote very casually, in the right margin, \u2018Solution:\u2019 \u2026and then nothing.\u201cDidn\u2019t you find someone to do your homework for you?\u201d Xie Yu put his own exercise book back in the desk drawer and asked, \u201cThat\u2019s all he did for you?\u201dHe Zhao said, \u201cI didn\u2019t contact him. Thanks to you reminding me, I realized that aside from myself, there\u2019s no one in the world with such suave handwriting. Look at the boldness of these strokes, these letter joins\u2026\u201dXie Yu mercilessly cut him off. \u201cYou can praise dogshit all you want, it won\u2019t grow flowers.\u201d\u201cDing Lianghua, you do the sprint and the relay, all right? I\u2019ve heard about your heroic exploits. You\u2019re very explosive for a short distance\u2026 and then, the girls. I\u2019m not so sure about things on your side. Qing-jie, help me out? Get a list of who wants to participate on the girls\u2019 side.\u201dDuring gym class, Luo Wenqiang, Liu Cunhao, and the others sat on the quad in a circle. Luo Wenqiang had put three pens in his pocket and now he pulled one out and handed it to Xu Qingqing. \u201cAnd the class event is tug-of-war, so I\u2019ll find some time to explain the strategy to you. As for long-distance, that\u2019ll be Zhao-ge and Yu-ge\u2026 ah, where are they?\u201dAt this point, Luo Wenqiang found that the two long-distance champions he had already picked out last week were both not present.Wan Da said, \u201cYou only realized now that they\u2019re not here? They were called to the faculty office.\u201dLiu Cunhao added: \u201cThose two long-distance runners got all the math homework wrong.\u201dLuo Wenqiang scratched the back of his head. \u201cAh? I was so excited after getting the notice about the sports event that I didn\u2019t notice\u2026\u201dThe two long-distance runners were currently suffering a fate worse than death in the faculty office.\u201cThe two of you, take your homework and find somewhere to sit. When you figure it out, then you can go to gym class.\u201d Wu Zheng finished speaking, then looked down and continued grading homework. \u201cThe two of you are really something. But there\u2019s one thing I have to compliment you on. At least you don\u2019t copy, and you have a bottom line that you stick to.\u201dHe Zhao said, \u201cThank you, thank you.\u201dWu Zheng hadn\u2019t imagined He Zhao had such a thick skin, either. His hand stilled on the homework pile. \u201cYou really think I\u2019m praising you?!\u201dXie Yu took the homework and dragged He Zhao away. He explained on behalf of his deskmate, \u201cHe didn\u2019t take his meds before leaving his dorm room today.\u201d\u201cHe does have to take meds,\u201d Wu Zheng said. \u201cHe\u2019s quite seriously ill.\u201dThere weren\u2019t many teachers in the faculty office at this time. Old Tang had gone to teach literature to the class next door and his desk was empty, so they sat at Old Tang\u2019s desk and did the questions, since it wasn\u2019t convenient to sit at other teachers\u2019 desks.The last few times they had been here, neither of them had noticed that Tang Sen\u2019s desk held several small potted plants, their individual names written on post-it notes alongside to-do lists like the watering schedule. He was clearly very attentive.He Zhao lifted his hand to one of the post-its and read out the name of the small succulent plant. \u201c\u2026Xiao Cui?\u201dXie Yu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAre middle-aged men all so terrifying when they name things? This is a Haworthia cooperi, isn\u2019t it?\u201d He Zhao rested his forearms on his exercise book; clearly he was in no mood to do the questions. \u201cHe\u2019s a literature teacher after all. Xiao Cui?\u201dXie Yu glanced up. Under the glass pane covering Tang Sen\u2019s desk were many photographs of the classes he had taught over the years, the dates ranging from the 00s in a neat row all the way up to last year.\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d He Zhao asked.Xie Yu was about to say he was looking for last year\u2019s graduating class\u2019s photos, then figured this would be a silly thing to say, and decided to say nothing and keep doing the homework instead.The office desk separated them. He Zhao kept talking for a while more, then stealthily slid his stool over little by little, only stopping when he was right next to Xie Yu. He poked his deskmate with a pen. \u201cDid you get the question Old Wu was explaining just now?\u201dXie Yu gripped his own pen and asked, \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\u201cI think I got it,\u201d He Zhao said. \u201cI think I really got it this time.\u201dThe questions weren\u2019t hard. Wu Zheng walked them both through it, from the structure to the individual steps, and they would have had to be idiots to still not get it.Fortunately, this time when He Zhao said he understood, he really had understood. Most likely, he just really wanted to go to gym class, so his intelligence took a temporary leap. Xie Yu also relaxed his expectations of himself, and after half a class period or so they managed to work the questions out.\u201cThey\u2019re here, they\u2019re here. Gym rep, your long distance runners are here.\u201d Wan Da\u2019s eyes were sharp and caught sight of He Zhao and Xie Yu from a distance. \u201cThe hopes of our village\u2014no, our class\u2014are here.\u201d\u201cWhat hopes of the village?\u201d He Zhao walked over and saw Class 2.3 all sitting on the quad in a big and neat circle. He also sat down and tapped the floor. \u201cOld Xie, sit.\u201d\u201cThe long distance event! Three thousand meters.\u00b9 No one in class wants to run it.\u201d\u201cPut it down.\u201d He Zhao waved a hand generously. \u201cMy name. Put me down for anything.\u201dWan Da: \u201cImpressive.\u201dLiu Cunhao: \u201cStrong!\u201dLuo Wenqiang then looked at Xie Yu, who said with indifference, \u201cFine.\u201dThe word \u2018fine\u2019 was the most gentle thing Luo Wenqiang had ever heard come out of Xie Yu\u2019s mouth, and he was so touched he almost cried. \u201cAll right, then I\u2019m putting your names down. The two of you, first long distance, and then\u2026 let me see. Push-ups? Can you do push-ups?\u201dThe sports meet spanned two days, which meant there were no classes for those two days.Although no one was that enthusiastic about sports, the two days of no classes were very attractive. And even if they didn\u2019t step onto the court, everyone wanted to have a share in it.\u201cThe class next door got a set of class t-shirts. Should we get a set, too?\u201d Xu Qingqing was rather attentive to dress. \u201cWe can lose in anything else but we can\u2019t lose in momentum.\u201dWan Da said, \u201cA guy from the class next door is crossdressing. Do we have to find someone to do that, too?\u201dThe topic of conversation got weirder and weirder.By the time the dismissal bell rang, they still hadn\u2019t reached any sort of conclusion.The student on duty returned the gym equipment to the equipment room while Luo Wenqiang was in charge of cleaning up the court. The circle of the class 2.3 students had dispersed, leaving only stragglers behind.Wan Da went over to He Zhao and whispered, \u201cActually, when we were talking about crossdressing just now, the first person I thought of was Yu-ge.\u201dHe Zhao: \u201cIf you want to die, I can see you off.\u201d\u201cNo, really. With Yu-ge\u2019s looks\u2014I\u2019m not saying he\u2019s girly, he\u2019s not girly at all, he\u2019s very manly\u2026\u201d Wan Da searched his entire vocabulary and couldn\u2019t come up with a suitable descriptor. \u201cThat is, anyway, both Qing-jie and I think so. Do you think Yu-ge will agree?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re really going to die.\u201dHe Zhao continued, \u201cAnd you\u2019re going to leave this world at a speed you can\u2019t even imagine.\u201dWhen Xu Qingqing got wind of this news she was a little regretful, but then she had an epiphany and thought of a new idea. \u201cSince we can\u2019t win the most beautiful in the year award, then we must have a most eye-catching crossdressing Big Bro, like a Golden Barbie\u2026\u201d \u00b2Luo Wenqiang felt a chill wind at his back.And then countless pairs of eyes turned to stare at him.Xie Yu wasn\u2019t aware of this Crossdressing Big Bro discussion. He had gone outside to take a call and by the time he came back in, Luo Wenqiang was already sitting on the floor of the classroom crying. \u201cI don\u2019t want to, I refuse\u2014why must you all do this to me?!\u201d\u201cYour muscles are very sexy,\u201d Wan Da comforted him. \u201cHave a little faith in yourself.\u201dHe Zhao was laughing so hard he couldn\u2019t sit up straight. He waved to Xie Yu, then leant close and said, \u201cOur class rep, in girls\u2019 clothes. Scary or not?\u201d\u201cAre we making a horror film?\u201dHe Zhao said, \u201cYeah.\u201dThen He Zhao continued, \u201cHave you worn a skirt before?\u201dSomething suddenly snapped in Xie Yu\u2019s mind.Things were better now that his looks had matured a little. When he was a child, even though he had his hair cut short, many people had mistaken him for a girl, Zhou Dalei being one idiot among them. He had called Xie Yu \u2018little girl\u2019 and so their friendship had taken many more years than it otherwise would have to solidify. Now, they only rarely met.Zhou Dalei had been very troubled, too. He had to admit he was wrong and he couldn\u2019t beat Xie Yu in a fight.Madam Gu had also played pranks of her own when she was younger. Her son was soft and cute and pretty, so she found it fun to cajole him into wearing skirts. Now, at home, there were several photos of his dark history that he\u2019d never be able to erase.Wan Da was still trying to comfort the psychologically scarred gym rep when he heard a crash in the back of the classroom. He looked up and saw that for some reason He Zhao and Xie Yu had gotten into a tangle again and even overturned their chairs.Liu Cunhao couldn\u2019t help sighing as he looked on. \u201cThey\u2019re doing it again? If a day goes by where they don\u2019t do something, I\u2019ll feel that Class 2.3 is lacking something.\u201d\u201cBig bro, I\u2019m wrong, I\u2019m wrong, all right?\u201d He Zhao cajoled as he admitted his mistake, at the same time pouring oil on the fire with his own hands. \u201cBut Old Xie doth protest too much, methinks. Have you really worn a skirt before?\u201dXie Yu had been talking with his fists the whole time. He Zhao couldn\u2019t hold his own, and he didn\u2019t dare retaliate, so now he leaned backward and clutched his stomach, yelling, \u201c.. Ah, that hurts.\u201dDue to He Zhao\u2019s impressive track record, Xie Yu\u2019s first thought was that he was putting on an act again. And a very exaggerated one, at that.But Xie Yu still took two steps forward, not knowing why. \u201cWhere does it hurt?\u201dHe Zhao\u2019s mind didn\u2019t work fast enough and he didn\u2019t know what to say. His mind went through three different locations within a single second and finally his hand stopped on his chest. \u201cHere. Maybe it\u2019s internal injuries.\u201dHe only needed to open his mouth to cause internal injuries. Truly impressive.Xie Yu reached out and touched him through his shirt\u2019s fabric. \u201cHere?\u201dHe Zhao looked down at Xie Yu\u2019s hand resting on his chest and suddenly felt a little dazed. \u201cAh, yeah.\u201dThat strange and confusing thought didn\u2019t stay very long. He saw Xie Yu twist his wrist and said, \u201cDamn it, you\u2019re really going to give me internal injuries\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

While Old Tang wasn\u2019t watching, Liu Cunhao and the others used the class computer to look for skirts. \u201cHow about this one? There\u2019s lace, so it looks princessy\u2026 romantic, and also quite elegant.\u201dWan Da: \u201cLet\u2019s go with this maid outfit. This one\u2019s good. Looks seductive.\u201dLuo Wenqiang, who had no affection for such things: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThe one above that. Scroll up.\u201d After the tussle with Xie Yu, He Zhao bent down and righted his chair with one hand, joining in on the fun. \u201cNot that one. Scroll up.\u201d\u201cWhich one?\u201d Liu Cunhao scrolled up for a long time and didn\u2019t see any that fit the bill, so the more he scrolled the more confused he was. \u201cZhao-ge, did you see wrong?\u201dThen He Zhao showcased his taste in women\u2019s clothing to the whole class without holding back at all. \u201cThird from the top. That one\u2019s good.\u201dOn the screen was a peony floral-print sheath dress, a dogshit mess of clashing red and green.\u201cWhy are you looking at me like that?\u201d He Zhao sat in his seat and looked at the projector screen, then at his deskmate. \u201cWhat do you think? Isn\u2019t this a good one?\u201dLiu Cunhao and the others were shocked into silence by this unbearably tacky dress and He Zhao\u2019s textbook terrible taste. A thousand words stuck in each of their throats.Xie Yu said, \u201cDon\u2019t you have any sense of this at all?\u201dHe Zhao said, \u201cI think it\u2019s fine. If this were a dressup game, this dress would definitely get a good score.\u201d\u201cA Renminbi player has no right to speak here.\u201d\u201cBelieve me.\u201d\u201cShut up.\u201d\u201cLook at these colors. So bright\u2026\u201d\u201cBright?\u201d Xie Yu sneered, drawing blood at once. \u201cThe aunties at the flea market have taste that leaves yours eight blocks in the dust.\u201dWhen Xie Yu finished, Wan Da started clapping. \u201cWell said. Exquisite.\u201dLiu Cunhao: \u201cA like for Yu-ge.\u201dHe Zhao: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter He Zhao\u2019s farce, Luo Wenqiang\u2019s emotions had gone through a rollercoaster and opposing forces had leveled each other out. Now he felt that the romantic princess dress and the maid uniform weren\u2019t that hard to stomach after all.So Luo Wenqiang clenched his hands into fists and endured the pain. \u201cThen, then let\u2019s go with the one from just now.\u201d\u201cZhao-ge, well done!\u201dWan Da had clearly overthought things. Recalling what had just happened, he now thought that He Zhao had intentionally looked for the ugliest outfit to provoke the gym rep. He shot He Zhao a thumbs-up and said with respect, \u201cYou still have the most impressive tricks.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll take the compliment.\u201d He Zhao was very confused but he was fairly well-practiced at carrying on a conversation. After he said that, he bent close to Xie Yu\u2019s ear and whispered, \u201cWhat\u2019s he praising me for?\u201dXie Yu pushed his head away; he wasn\u2019t in the mood to talk.After the last class of the day, everyone packed up their bags and prepared to go home as the student on duty cleaned the blackboard.The live-in students were more concerned with what was for dinner. He Zhao had been messing around on his phone all through the last class period, and he even slipped out to make a phone call while Old Wu wasn\u2019t looking.Recently, the Gold List Restaurant had started a school delivery service and had sent a text to their customer mailing list to let them know.He Zhao finished ordering, then asked, \u201cWhere do you want to send it? Which room?\u201dShen Jie walked out of the toilet, coughing, smoke curling around him as he sprayed air freshener on himself to mask the smell of smoke. He turned and saw his Zhao-ge with one hand stuck in his pocket, standing in the corner of the stairwell with his back to the wall.\u201cZhao-ge, what are you doing?\u201d Shen Jie walked over, still spraying.He Zhao turned to glance at him and didn\u2019t respond. After a moment\u2019s thought, he said into the phone, \u201cAnd a fish, too,\u201d then pulled the phone away and met Shen Jie\u2019s eyes. \u201cWhat was the name of that fish dish you ordered at the Gold List?\u201dShen Jie responded, \u201cAh? What fish? The one that got overturned on the floor? Steamed perch. Why?\u201d\u201cNothing.\u201d He Zhao reported the name of the dish, then continued, \u201cMy little friend likes it.\u201dShen Jie\u2019s hand jerked. \u201c\u2026Wow, damn.\u201dThe dismissal bell rang and the deliveryman happened to call at the same time.He Zhao went downstairs to collect the food. There were hardly any people left in the classroom; the live-in students had gone to the cafeteria to eat and only the student on duty was still here cleaning.The classroom was much quieter now.Xie Yu sat there, extremely bored. He really wasn\u2019t sure what He Zhao was doing. Near the end of class he had told Xie Yu, \u201cStay right here and don\u2019t go anywhere.\u201d Before he finished, Xie Yu had already stamped on his foot.The last class period was math and Old Wu had gone over the new formats for the questions in the next monthly exam, but not in much detail.Xie Yu was bored anyway, so he wrote down the solution steps on the notes app in his phone, then pulled out a piece of scratch paper and started to draft it.He had just one pen. At the baptism in the slackers\u2019 gathering grounds at the previous monthly exam, he had discovered that nearly everyone was short some writing materials, whether an eraser or a 2B pencil. Some didn\u2019t even have a pen to answer the questions with.The group had traded supplies back and forth\u2014I save you and you save me\u2014and some people even wrote their exams with the lead refill for a mechanical pencil.Xie Yu had probably dropped his pen one too many times. No ink came out when he started writing, so he tossed it and looked on He Zhao\u2019s side of the desk for a different pen to use.In order to hide that he was playing phone games in class, He Zhao\u2019s side of the desk was quite messy and books were haphazardly stacked together.Xie Yu went through the pile for a while. He didn\u2019t find a pen, but he did find a strange piece of paper in a math book. He couldn\u2019t make out the higgledy-piggledy scrawl\u2014it seemed like the solution steps to a problem\u2014but before he could look at it more closely He Zhao walked into class carrying a bag. \u201cClean up, and put away all the books on the desk or there won\u2019t be room for dinner.\u201dXie Yu stuffed the piece of paper back.There were about five dishes, each in their own disposable container, as well as two cartons of rice.Xie Yu looked at the fish and found it very familiar. \u201cGold List?\u201dHe Zhao split his disposable wooden chopsticks and picked out the spring onion slices on the steamed perch before pushing the fish toward his deskmate. \u201cAh, I had to climb the wall to get it. They said deliver to the school. Damn it, is across a brick wall considered \u2018delivered to the school?\u2019\u201dXie Yu was aware he was a picky eater. When Madam Gu cooked she was careful about the dishes she made, but He Zhao\u2019s selection of dishes this time around hadn\u2019t triggered any landmines either.He faintly remembered He Zhao asking him, the previous time, what he wouldn\u2019t eat. Had this idiot really remembered?\u201cGo on, what are you waiting for?\u201d He Zhao said. \u201cWaiting for me to feed you? Not that I mind. Call me big bro. We can talk about it.\u201dXie Yu picked up his chopsticks to split them. \u201cDo you want to die?\u201dWan Da returned from dinner, humming as he walked in holding a cup of milk tea. From the doorway he could smell food and as he walked in, he looked at the table. \u201cThe two of you went a little overboard, didn\u2019t you? The cafeteria food was so bland it was ready to hatch,\u00b9 and it was all leftovers from lunch\u2026 but here you are, enjoying yourselves.\u201dHe Zhao finished his last two bites of rice and said, \u201cYou\u2019re enjoying yourself, too, aren\u2019t you? Where did you get the milk tea? Is it good?\u201d\u201cThe Fudan Milk Tea shop across the street,\u201d Wan Da said. \u201cIt\u2019s passable. But it says bubble milk tea and I never found any bubbles.\u201dXie Yu said, \u201cThen why did you buy it?\u201dWan Da said, \u201cTo be very honest, Fudan\u00b2 is my dream.\u201dFor the rest of the week, the sports meet was on everyone\u2019s mind.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dFor the sports meet class uniform, Xu Qingqing picked a vest; it was practical and they could keep wearing it after the meet was over. Luo Wenqiang wore that elegant and high-class princess dress and walked at the front of the line, holding a placard.The gym teacher gave everyone free time to practice and even directed them.\u201cWho signed up for the push-ups?\u201d After picking out the shot put participants, the teacher walked over again blowing his whistle. \u201cWho signed up for the push-ups? Eight of you, right? Come on up and show us what you can do.\u201dHe Zhao, Xie Yu and the others stepped up.\u201cIt\u2019s not how many you do that counts. The judges are looking for form. At last year\u2019s meet, wow\u2014the first row of participants were so energetic. They were competing for who could do more. Up, down, up, down, so quickly, and in the end\u2014let me tell you\u2014the one who went the slowest ended up winning.\u201dThe gym teacher made them plank on the ground, then walked from the head of the line to the end. He hadn\u2019t even started the timer and already one of the boys couldn\u2019t hold it and fell down.The first one fell, then three or four others fell like dominoes.He Zhao didn\u2019t feel anything. He could still hold it for a long time, but seeing that all the people next to him were sitting on the ground, he felt a little silly still holding his own plank, so he and Xie Yu both went along and sat on the ground.The gym teacher stopped walking and said, \u201c\u2026Aren\u2019t you lot too weak? Just this little bit and you already can\u2019t do it? Do you want to do well in the sports meet or not?!\u201dXie Yu had originally intended to skip gym class and go back to his dorm room to read, but Luo Wenqiang had dragged the entire class out to prepare for the sports meet.The eight push-up contestants sat on the floor of the indoor court. To one side, several pairs of first-year students were playing badminton.The shuttlecocks flew across the indoor court. Up into the air, and then down again.\u201cHow many can you do? He Zhao asked.Xie Yu looked at the player before him run forward several steps, then leap to hit the shuttlecock. He said, \u201cDon\u2019t know. Never counted.\u201d\u201cLater, should we see who can do more?\u201dThe gym teacher didn\u2019t give them the chance to compete. He gave it everything he had and said he\u2019d be able to get their planking skills up to a never-before-seen level in just one short class period.\u201cYes, yes, yes.\u201d Wan Da raised his hand. \u201cCoach, I want to learn this.\u201dThe gym teacher smiled and said, very meaningfully, \u201cThen let us begin.\u201dXie Yu had a bad premonition.Two minutes later, the bad premonition became reality.The shuttlecocks were no longer flying through the indoor court, and instead a chorus of \u2018Whoa\u2019 resounded throughout the hall.The gym teacher squatted by the side and said, \u201cOdd-numbered students, lie down. Even-numbered students, begin. On my count, do a push-up. After fifty, you can rest.\u201dXie Yu lay under He Zhao and slowly, with a complicated feelings, spat out a single word. \u201c\u2026Fuck.\u201dHe Zhao\u2019s hands were on either side of Xie Yu\u2019s arms, supporting the weight of his upper body; he maintained his distance from Xie Yu and was still adjusting his posture. This really was a little strange and he couldn\u2019t help laughing. \u201cWho invented this? Genius. No wonder it\u2019ll take you to heights you\u2019ve never reached before.\u201dWan Da was really about to cry. He said to the guy above him, \u201cDo your best. If you don\u2019t hold it, something bad will happen.\u201dThe guy above him was also panicking. \u201cI-I-I\u2019ll do my best.\u201dOnce they had assumed their positions, the gym teacher blew the whistle for the first time. \u201c\u4e00\uff01\u201dHe Zhao lowered his body. The further he went, the closer he got to Xie Yu, and even though he tried to control his strength, he still inadvertently lightly touched him. Xie Yu\u2019s body heat seemed to reach him through the thin material of their clothing\u2014his heartbeat and even the light warmth of his breath seemed to tangle with He Zhao\u2019s.A while ago, He Zhao could still laugh at the prospect of this lying-down push-up setup; now, he couldn\u2019t laugh at all.The two of them couldn\u2019t avoid staring at each other\u2019s faces, and the magnified versions at that\u2014their eyes, noses, eyelashes, and even every single microexpression was crystal-clear.At the corner of Xie Yu\u2019s eye, there was a very tiny mole.Suddenly, He Zhao couldn\u2019t bear it any more. Who knew which of them turned away first, breaking this extended eye contact.He moved his fingers and found that his palms were sweating a little.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 61": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fake SlackersChapter 039 - Love and PeacePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayFake SlackersTranslator: JuryEditor: NomNomFirst Published on Chaleuria\u2014039 \u2013 Love and Peace\u201cStay strong! A true man has ambitions and goals! Darkness before his eyes is not darkness at all.\u201d The gym teacher had gotten tired of squatting and sat down on the ground, too. He glanced down at the time, then blew his whistle.He Zhao had just lifted his body up. Hearing this, he had to lower himself again. He hesitated a moment and found that he really couldn\u2019t continue staring at a certain little friend of his. If he kept looking, he probably wouldn\u2019t be able to complete even ten push-ups. So he turned his head away and his Adam\u2019s apple rolled involuntarily.This time, He Zhao didn\u2019t stay down too long. He hastily finished the push-up.Now that the two had averted their eyes, He Zhao stared attentively at the floor of the indoor court, as if flowers would sprout if he looked long enough. Then Xie Yu asked him, \u201cHow many?\u201d\u201cAh.\u201d He Zhao couldn\u2019t think properly and he had not been paying attention to the count at all. \u201cI don\u2019t know. You weren\u2019t counting, either?\u201dXie Yu had turned his head away, and was looking up and to the side. There were several exposed beams on the roof of the indoor court, and above that, glass panes arranged in a grid. Xie Yu paused before saying, \u201cI didn\u2019t count.\u201d\u201cProbably more than ten.\u201dAs He Zhao finished speaking, he found that he couldn\u2019t keep staring at the floor. His gaze drifted, slowly coming to alight on Xie Yu\u2019s neck; the line of it was surprisingly beautiful, and in the end he said\u2014whether to himself or Xie Yu, who knew\u2014\u201c\u2026 Just bear with it for a little longer.\u201dAll right, he could do that.He\u2019d bear with it.When Xie Yu had first lain down, he had really wanted to raise one knee and send this guy flying. He maintained a cold expression, feeling very foolish. His mock exams had been right there and instead of doing them, he had come to attend this absurd gym class.After he calmed down, he started to think about who he would kill first after he got up.Luo Wenqiang, who had dragged Xie Yu to gym class on pain of death, was currently training at the quad. For some reason, he felt a chilly wind at his back. He rubbed his arms and wondered how the weather could cool so quickly.He Zhao usually liked to play pranks, but even he was quite restrained at a time like this\u2026 Xie Yu got the impression that He Zhao was aching to run away, as though he was tensed to jump up at any second, but was restraining himself.Xie Yu wasn\u2019t sure if the heartbeat he heard ringing in his ears was his own or He Zhao\u2019s\u2014especially when He Zhao lowered his body and the two were chest to chest for several fleeting seconds.Xie Yu watched the ceiling beams and faintly felt that something wasn\u2019t right. Or should he say that this feeling\u2014that something wasn\u2019t right\u2014had been around for a long time, but it was especially strong today.A wild beast had long since taken up residence in his heart, and while it ordinarily napped quietly, today it was charged with excitement and started wildly roaring. It was unnerving, but at the same time\u2026 very thrilling, somehow.The gym teacher had started the exercise out counting, and somewhere in the middle he had replaced the count with the whistle. Some of them couldn\u2019t help thinking he was trying to surreptitiously make them do a few more. They were still complaining internally when the gym teacher blew on the whistle again and then reported, \u201cTwenty! Very good, keep going!\u201dA student expressed his doubt. \u201cTeach, only twenty? I feel like I\u2019ve done thirty.\u201dThe gym teacher didn\u2019t flinch. \u201cStudent, you\u2019re imagining things.\u201dWhether it had been twenty or thirty, the two groups of students were thoroughly unable to continue.Even though each of them had another male student still lying beneath them and the slightest relaxation of their wrists would cause a tragedy, it still beat the torture that was doing push-ups. One of them bowed his head and said, \u201cKnow-It-All, I can\u2019t endure any longer.\u201dWan Da: \u201cHow can you say you can\u2019t! Is your life\u2019s mission so easily defeated by fifty paltry push-ups?\u201d\u201c\u2026I really can\u2019t do any more.\u201dMore and more students crowded around, making a ruckus. Aside from those who had been playing badminton, another huge group had arrived, both from the year above and the year below. Liu Cunhao took the opportunity to slip in, too. \u201cDamn it, you all\u2026 are very ardent.\u201dXie Yu put one hand to his forehead. He felt a headache coming on.\u201cCan we not linger here watching the show, friends?\u201d He Zhao turned and said. \u201cEspecially you, Liu Cunhao. As the class chairman, could you please protect the dignity of the students in our class 3?\u201dAs if the students in Class 2.3 still had dignity left. It had all been lost long ago.Even though they had lost their dignity, they still had a chance to save their push-up abilities. There were several first-year girls in the surrounding crowd\u2014this was just like showing off for girls in the audience stand when playing basketball. Even if they were down to their very last breath, they had to display their physical prowess.Wan Da watched with his own eyes as the guy who had just said, \u201cI can\u2019t any more,\u201d suddenly lifted his left hand, curling his hand into a fist, and started doing one-armed push-ups. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe Zhao had to stop and stare. \u201cWow. Impressive. Friend, can you win first place for our class?\u201dLiu Cunhao led the applause. \u201cFu Pei, do your best! Another fifty!\u201dFu Pei\u2019s whole body went taut. He grit his teeth and kept working.Xie Yu had turned to look, too. After watching for a while, he asked, \u201cFu Pei? There\u2019s someone with that name in our class?\u201dHe Zhao was three push-ups away from fifty. As he lowered his body, he bent close to Xie Yu\u2019s ear and said, \u201cFrom the column next to us, second row from the back. When school started, Old Tang called him over to talk because of some online dating problem.\u201dXie Yu searched through his memory but came up with nothing, and on his face hung the words, \u2018No impression.\u2019\u201cI knew you wouldn\u2019t remember.\u201d He Zhao pushed himself up, exhaled, and said, \u201cTell me. You\u2019ve been in this class for more than a month. What do you know of us?\u201dFrom Xie Yu\u2019s position he could see the knot in He Zhao\u2019s throat; he followed that line of sight downward to the somewhat rumpled collar of He Zhao\u2019s uniform shirt.Fifty push-ups; he could not be feeling nothing. Besides, he was currently in a state of high tension and after doing the last push-up, he suddenly felt very exhausted. He rotated his wrist hard and fell down to one side, lying next to Xie Yu. He said slowly, \u201c\u2026Fifty. Your big brother\u2019s impressive, isn\u2019t he?\u201dXie Yu moved himself farther to the other side and said, \u201cScram. My mom only gave birth to one child, and that\u2019s me.\u201dFu Pei was the most impressive on the court. He had done more than twenty one-handed push-ups and now he stopped to surreptitiously ask Wan Da, \u201cAre there any girls looking at me?\u201dWan Da couldn\u2019t bear to tell him the cruel truth\u2014that the whole audience, both guys and girls, were currently watching the two famous class beaus.\u201cIf you think there are, then there are.\u201d Wan Da patted Fu Pei\u2019s shoulders. \u201cYou can get up now.\u201dThe plan had been for them to switch positions so that the odd-numbered students were on top for another set of 50 push-ups. But the gym teacher hadn\u2019t properly planned for time, and just as they were supposed to switch positions, the dismissal bell rang.The gym teacher glanced at the stopwatch hanging at his chest and said regretfully, \u201cClass is over. All right, class dismissed.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe even-numbered students started to complain about their bad luck, while the odd-numbered students weren\u2019t sure if they were supposed to be happy. After all, they had lain down for so long for nothing. But they weren\u2019t really looking forward to doing push-ups on top of someone else, either.After returning to the classroom, He Zhao and Xie Yu didn\u2019t talk for the next class period.The atmosphere wasn\u2019t really awkward. Before, He Zhao would always start a conversation and chatter on, but now he had suddenly gone quiet. He occasionally said something, but the moment he began, he would lock eyes with Xie Yu and his brain seemed to short-circuit, so he couldn\u2019t continue.\u201cWhat on earth do you want to say?\u201dAfter being disturbed several times\u2014He Zhao would call his name, Xie Yu, Old Xie, Deskmate, in succession and then wouldn\u2019t say any more\u2014Xie Yu was so annoyed he was getting a headache.He Zhao flipped open his English textbook and pointed at it, looking for a question to ask. \u201cWhich page are we on?\u201dXie Yu said, \u201cChapter three.\u201dHe Zhao made a noise of assent and went quiet again.After this exchange, the two students in front of them weren\u2019t sure what to do. They exchanged notes. They had a falling-out? A quarrel?The note passed all the way to the class chair\u2019s hands. Liu Cunhao remembered how lovey-dovey the two school tyrants had been during gym class, and while the English teacher was turned to the blackboard and writing example sentences, he looked down and wrote, Not at all. Last class they were still sticking together like glue.Like a madman, He Zhao stared at his English book for a long time before remembering that he shouldn\u2019t be listening in class\u2014he should be on his phone.So, Xie Yu, who always remembered to be on his phone every class period and was now chatting up a storm with Zhou Dalei, returned to his dashboard and saw that He Zhao had added a mood message: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah.Xie Yu: \u201c\u2026Has he really gone mad.\u201dBefore the sports meet, the uniforms the class had ordered arrived. Old Tang let them change into them to see how they looked, and then he brought an old-fashioned camera from his office.The class uniform was a specially-made vest; they need only put it over their uniform. To decide what should be written on the vest, the class had held a vote and there had been all kinds of submissions: Together till the end of time, Forever young\u2026In the end, the voting session had turned into a massacre of who could be the most exaggerated and pretentious.\u201cI\u2019m the best!\u201d\u201cForever young!\u201d\u201cI am the best!\u201dIt had dissolved into a quarrel so violent it could overturn the sky. In the end, Old Tang came over, and the literature teacher who had one foot over the line of middle-age bestowed three words upon them: Love and Peace.He Zhao took the vest out of its packaging and shook it out. A simple rectangular shape, the words Love and Peace ostentatious on the back.Xie Yu hesitated for a long time. He didn\u2019t want to put it on.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dBut the most troubled of all was Luo Wenqiang; he couldn\u2019t go to the boys\u2019 bathroom to change into a dress, after all. He Zhao put on the vest and got Liu Cunhao and the others to make a human wall. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, bro. Just change.\u201dXie Yu came back from the bathroom and Wan Da shouted to him, \u201cYu-ge, join us. We have an empty spot here. Help us fill it.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not helping.\u201d\u201cZhao-ge, your little friend.\u201d After the chilly Big Bro of the West Building had walked off, Wan Da whispered to He Zhao, \u201cCan you keep him in line?\u201dHe Zhao stuck his hands in his pocket, fingertips brushing against a piece of lollipop wrapping paper. He suddenly smiled and said, \u201cI really can\u2019t keep him in line\u2026 it\u2019s more like he keeps me in line.\u201dFor some inexplicable reason, the word \u2018henpecked\u2019 flashed through Wan Da\u2019s mind and scared him so much he jumped. Thankfully, Luo Wenqiang had already changed clothes and was currently huddled in a corner of the classroom, completely desolate, and refusing to show his face, thereby attracting the attention of everyone in class. \u201cIf you\u2019ve changed, then come out! Hurry up. Are you a man or not? Dithering around like that.\u201dHe Zhao took two steps backward and stood next to his seat. Now that he had retreated, a certain massive creature curled up in the corner was fully exposed to everyone\u2019s eyes.Luo Wenqiang clutched at the wall. \u201c\u2026I don\u2019t want to live any more. You all are cruelly tearing away any chance a pure-hearted young man has at teenage love. There\u2019s no way I\u2019ll be able to find a girlfriend in my three years of high school life now.\u201dHe Zhao sat on his desk and smiled.Xie Yu also found it funny, but his sympathy won out and he decided to save the last scrap of the gym rep\u2019s dignity for him.He Zhao, noticing, reached out to tap Xie Yu\u2019s head. \u201cLittle friend, are you in a bad mood?\u201d\u201cLittle friend, your ass.\u201dXie Yu couldn\u2019t control himself, either, and almost laughed out loud. He said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be too cruel.\u201dTang Sen raised his camera. He stood in the classroom doorway and smiled as he snapped a photo.It wasn\u2019t a proper class photo; they weren\u2019t lined up but scattered around the back of the classroom. Luo Wenqiang had cried for a long time, and Wan Da now handed him a mirror. He couldn\u2019t keep crying and, in fact, he started laughing at himself, too. Xu Qingqing took pictures with her mobile phone and everyone else couldn\u2019t stand up straight for laughing.Let us freeze the scene at this instant.The instant when everyone has a smile on their face; endlessly energetic and bursting with youthful vigor.And the two boys in the last row.Although we can only see their backs, they are very close together. Especially He Zhao, who is sitting on the desk: his posture is relaxed and open, audacious and lawless.He Zhao\u2019s body is tilted to one side, showing half his face in profile; his hand lies on Xie Yu\u2019s head, fingers threaded lightly through Xie Yu\u2019s hair, a faint smile on his lips.And the back of Xie Yu\u2019s head seems to have the word Cold written on it.The dazzling brilliance of the sunlight trying to shine through the window was stopped by the curtains. Now a wind blows the curtains upward to reveal these two desks, forever misaligned. The blackboard, full of chalk-scribbled words, as well as all the students in class, are bathed in this radiance.They wear vests in the same style with three big words on the back: Love and Peace.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Students, the phrase \u2018holistic development\u2019 consists of values, intelligence, body, beauty, and hard work. The \u2018body\u2019 refers to one\u2019s physical condition.\u201dThe sports meet had not yet begun, but there definitely weren\u2019t enough seats in the stadium and everybody was currently moving chairs from the classrooms to the quad. The stairwells were jam-packed with people.Dean \u2018DJ\u2019 Jiang\u2019s voice was currently reverberating through the school. \u201cPhysical training and a love for exercise represents the spirit of physical development. I know that in the day-to-day, everyone is busy with schoolwork, but today you can soar freely upon the quad and let your perspiration fly\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy is it so crowded? Are you letting us pass or not?\u201dThese male eagles that should have been soaring freely over the quad were currently all stuck in the stairwell entranceway. Not only the entranceway, but the entire corridor was full of the click-clack sounds of things being dragged. It was as congested as rush hour traffic, so packed that even water might not have been able to flow through the cracks.Class 2.3 occupied the part of the corridor outside their own classroom, and the ones who couldn\u2019t squeeze out were still waiting in the classroom.Wan Da had left his chair in the doorway and no one knew where he had gone. After several minutes, he returned, squeezing back out of the stream of people. \u201cDamn it, the line goes from the fifth floor to the first floor. The building we were in last year is even worse. Collisions all along both the east and west buildings.\u201d\u201cWhy are you being a busybody about unrelated things?! If you have so much free time you should have moved your chair downstairs.\u201d He Zhao dragged his own chair to the rear door of the classroom and, seeing the impressive sight outside, just gave up and sat down in the rear doorway. He said around the lollipop in his mouth, \u201cJust wait. It\u2019ll probably be jammed for another ten minutes, at least.\u201dAs he finished, he turned back to Xie Yu. \u201cOld Xie, come over?\u201dXie Yu didn\u2019t move. He lay on his desk and said with his eyes closed, \u201cNot going. Being squashed in a crowd is no fun.\u201d\u201cHelp me put my number tag on. I can\u2019t reach my back.\u201d He Zhao held the number tag the gym rep had handed out earlier: a piece of cloth, slightly yellowed from many uses, with a 4-digit number on it. \u201cQuickly. I\u2019m the hope of the entire village.\u201dXie Yu didn\u2019t react.He Zhao repeated himself, then Xie Yu sat up and said, \u201cWan Da, go help the hope of the entire village with his number tag.\u201dWan Da, who had been dragged into the conversation for no reason: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWan Da glanced left and then glanced right. He met He Zhao\u2019s eyes and found that, although Zhao-ge hadn\u2019t said a word, his silence spoke volumes. He could understand from He Zhao\u2019s face: Please read the room. I want my deskmate to help, so don\u2019t you dare come over and try.So Wan Da turned around and pretended not to have heard. \u201cAh, why aren\u2019t they moving? How much longer is this jam going to last?\u201dXie Yu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe Zhao mentally took note of Wan Da\u2019s contribution, then dragged the chair back and put the safety pins and the number tag on the desk. \u201cSorry to trouble you, little friend.\u201dXie Yu took the safety pin and seriously considered pricking him to death.He Zhao sat facing the back of his chair, his back to Xie Yu. Wan Da stood in the doorway and shot him a complicated look. He Zhao smiled and even audaciously made a \u2018Yeah\u2019 gesture in the air.Wan Da shook his head; he couldn\u2019t bear watching any longer.Xie Yu pinned the number on He Zhao\u2019s shirt with a safety pin in each of the four corners. When he was done, he mercilessly kicked He Zhao\u2019s chair to tell him to get lost, and said dismissively, \u201cDone.\u201dHe Zhao put a hand to his back and realized Xie Yu had done quite an attentive job, and was about to praise him but Xie Yu kicked his chair again.Class 3 had had bad luck and was assigned the corner of the stadium directly opposite the stage, under the hot sun.Each of the classes walked in square formation onto the court. Luo Wenqiang had changed clothes in the indoor court\u2019s toilet and now he walked right in front, holding the class flag. He Zhao and Xie Yu walked side by side right behind him, leading the rest of the class.In Xu Qingqing\u2019s words: He Zhao and Xie Yu are the faces of our class. They\u2019ll hold up everything for us.Xu Qingqing had meant \u2018they\u2019re good-looking,\u2019 but everyone from the other classes didn\u2019t think so.When they looked at Class 3\u2019s marching formation, the only emotion in their hearts was terror. Even though the background music was a rousing military march, with the former Big Bros of the East and West buildings in front leading more than thirty other people out, it really gave the impression that they were ready to roll up their sleeves and start a brawl at any second.Terribly, terribly wild.So even though Luo Wenqiang was wearing such audacious clothes, no one dared laugh at him.\u201cWhat\u2019s up with this lot,\u201d He Zhao turned his head slightly and said. \u201cNo one\u2019s laughing? Is it not funny? Everyone was so excited when next door\u2019s Crossdressing Big Bro walked out. Did we not measure up? Did we lose?\u201dXie Yu said, \u201cMaybe he\u2019s too ugly.\u201dLuo Wenqiang, who had taken a sword to the heart, thought, \u2026Have you considered my feelings?The sports meet spanned two days and the long distance event would be held on the afternoon of the second day. Today, they would only participate in the push-up event that was taking place in the indoor court.Although it was already autumn, the midday sun still shone strong in the sky and it felt a little hot.He Zhao took off his jacket and lay it over his head to block out the sun. He glanced down at his phone and saw that Da had sent him a forum link ten minutes ago.The subject line was, Live broadcast of the two hottest big bros in school \u2013 Doing! Push! Ups! I\u2019ve already exploded like fireworks!There were already more than a thousand replies and the topic stayed at the top of the school board, a sea of red. \u00b9He Zhao opened a few of the threads, and his instinctive reaction was to close out of the browser, as if he had just picked up a hot potato. He couldn\u2019t tell if it was because the sun was too hot or if he had suddenly started burning up from within for no reason again.After a while, He Zhao opened up the forum thread again\u2026 and, as if possessed, hit \u2018Save Image.\u2019There were three images in all. The indoor lighting was bad and the person taking photos also hadn\u2019t dared openly take the photographs, perhaps aware of their guilt, so the photos were out of focus\u2014blurry and suggestive.Although the photos weren\u2019t in focus, the two main actors were clearly recognizable.Wan Da, the big mouth, wouldn\u2019t have just sent it to He Zhao, he had probably sent it to the whole class.He Zhao tentatively nudged Xie Yu with his arm and asked, \u201c\u2026Did\u2013did you see it?\u201d\u201cSee what?\u201d Xie Yu\u2019s eyes were half-closed as if he was about to fall asleep.People milled about on the quad, some even riding their bicycles all around the quad. Others were doing warm-ups\u2014the boys from their class who had picked Ding Lianghua for the 100m sprint.Xu Qingqing and a group of other girls were writing an announcement to be submitted for broadcast, coming up with the script one line at a time.He Zhao was internally thinking what else could it be, of course it\u2019s the thread about our CP, \u00b2 but he couldn\u2019t say it out loud so he beat around the bush. \u201cYou know, the one.\u201dXie Yu looked at him. \u201cWhich one?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dIn the end, He Zhao beckoned to him with a finger and Xie Yu scooched over with much reluctance.He Zhao raised his jacket, indicating to Xie Yu to come in, and the two squeezed in under the jacket, head to head. The phone rested on He Zhao\u2019s thigh and Xie Yu had to lean in and look down to see.Xie Yu was looking very intently.He Zhao stared at the back of Xie Yu\u2019s neck, at his hair that was so soft to the touch and at his collarbone lightly jutting from the base of his neck, and felt a little regret.Why had he shown this to him? Or should he say, he wanted to see how he would react?He Zhao wasn\u2019t sure either what exactly he wanted to find out with this.Xie Yu went through a few pages. The comments were all about the same, matchmaking all the way. As he went through the comments, his finger suddenly stopped on comment #52, which had the comment Damn it, I want to push his head down! Kiss him! Just kiss him!\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dXie Yu blinked slowly, and then He Zhao heard him say calmly, \u201cAh, I see it now.\u201dHe Zhao hadn\u2019t thought of a response when everyone heard a shrill cheer. \u201cAh\u2014do your best!\u201dNot far away from the court, Ding Lianghua was in a half-squat with both hands on the track, preparing to run. When the shot rang out, he dashed forward, even faster than on that night when he had beaten up the study rep.\u201cBeautiful! First place!\u201d Luo Wenqiang\u2019s face was red from excitement. He spread his arms and said, \u201cDingding, I will give you a hug of love!\u201dDing Lianghua was normally already very shy and now he turned into a complete social recluse. After stepping off the court he smiled with embarrassment. \u201cNo, no, no need.\u201dHe wiped off his sweat and as he passed by, He Zhao also gave a word of praise. Xie Yu felt that it\u2019d be too cold not to say anything, so he also said, \u201cDing Hualiang, not bad.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cDing Lianghua.\u201d He Zhao lightly hit Xie Yu\u2019s head and whispered a reminder. \u201cHis name is Lianghua. When will you remember?\u201dOld Tang sat to one side, a thermos of wolfberry tea in his hands. He had brought homework to grade and he looked like an old man getting some sun to improve his calcium levels. He said, \u201cIt\u2019s good to be young,\u201d and as he gazed upon them, he reminisced deeply about his own youth.The study rep held a book in his hands and memorized English vocabulary while he watched the matches.Very soon, it was time for the pushup event.Coincidentally, the referee for this event was their gym teacher. When the students of Class 3 saw him they all felt deeply uncomfortable.The gym teacher held a record sheet in his hand and said, \u201cThe lot of you had better do well. After my special training, you had better place in the top eight\u2026 All right, get ready. One minute.\u201dXie Yu had taken off his vest, leaving him in a white short-sleeved shirt.He Zhao looked at him and said thoughtfully, \u201cIs it easier to move with less clothes? Old Xie, you\u2019ve thought this through.\u201dXie Yu thought, I was just hot.But he hadn\u2019t managed to say anything before He Zhao started stripping, taking off the vest in three motions. As he did so the inner shirt rode up, showing half his waist.Several people around made low, short \u2018Ah\u2019 sounds.\u201cIt does feel easier to move.\u201d He Zhao made several tentative motions, then found that Xie Yu wasn\u2019t saying anything and turned to ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dXie Yu said, \u201cI think you\u2019d better not be called Zhao-ge any more.\u201dHe Zhao didn\u2019t understand. \u201cAh, then what should I be called?\u201dXie Yu placed his palms flat on the ground and said coolly, \u201cBig Bro Flirt.\u201d\u00b3He Zhao thought about it for a long time and concluded that this was probably an insult.One minute of time. In the first half a minute, He Zhao and Xie Yu kept pace with each other.The gathered audience was whispering and Xie Yu faintly heard someone\u2019s ardent whisper. \u201cIs this the school forum audience group? Ah, I\u2019m also on the \u2018push his head down\u2019 team.\u201d\u201cMr. Tang, reporting in, good news, good news. Classmates He Zhao and Xie Yu have placed first and second in the push-up event respectively!\u201d Luo Wenqiang completed a formal military salute in front of Tang Sen and reported. \u201cAside from the two of them, the other six completely failed.\u201dTang Sen nodded. He pulled eight bottles of water from a carton and said, \u201cReward everyone. Greatly.\u201dXie Yu took the water the gym rep passed out, thanked him, and then glanced around at the people running on the quad and the people cheering for their classmates.Suddenly, he realized couldn\u2019t recall how last year\u2019s sports meet had gone.He probably hadn\u2019t come to the quad at all and had hid in the music room with earplugs in to sleep instead.He Zhao had a lollipop in his mouth and he offered Xie Yu one, stuffing it into Xie Yu\u2019s hand heedless of whether he was going to eat it or not. Then he smiled and shouted to Liu Cunhao who was running past: \u201cHao-zi, do your best!\u201dLiu Cunhao waved to them and answered, \u201cLong live Class 3! I\u2019m the best!\u201dHe Zhao leaned back in his seat again, smiling.Xie Yu didn\u2019t like sweets; he found them too cloying. But he looked down at the lollipop wrapper for a while and eventually opened it.Then Xie Yu stared at the white lines on the track and thought, Really, very cloying.It was orange and a little sour, too.That afternoon, near the end of the sports meet, Shen Jie came over from Class 8 and said, \u201cShall we go out to eat after school? Didn\u2019t Big Bro Xie say he\u2019d pay? Might as well be today.\u201dShen Jie and He Zhao had each footed the bill for one meal. Xie Yu didn\u2019t like owing people, so he had said that the next time they went out, he\u2019d pay. Any day was fine.He Zhao looked at Xie Yu, and seeing that his deskmate had no objections, he silently agreed. \u201cAll right. What shall we eat?\u201d\u201cEither way, not Gold List again.\u201d Shen Jie found an empty seat behind them and sat down, thinking hard. \u201cActually, we\u2019ve been to all the restaurants near school. The Top Scholar House is both expensive and the food isn\u2019t good. Why don\u2019t we give our business to some of the smaller restaurants on the other streets?\u201dSo, when school let out, they fruitlessly walked down three streets before deciding where to eat.Shen Jie looked up at the shop signboard and was a little confused. He felt as if he hadn\u2019t walked down three streets but circumnavigated the globe and returned to his original spot. \u201c\u2026Uh, why do the shops here name themselves so much like the ones near our school?\u201d\u201cDian Ji is right around the corner,\u201d Xie Yu reminded him from behind.Dian Ji\u2014the full name of the school was Information Technology and it was the vocational skills school closest to Erzhong.When school let out on Friday, some people from Dian Ji would come over to Erzhong\u2019s gate to wait for their friends. When Erzhong students quarrelled and, in true youthful fashion, arranged for a fight, they would also sometimes invite Dian Ji students to come and help out, and a single phone call could bring a carful of people.But Erzhong was rather strict so if they wanted to plan a fight, they had to pick a location farther away from the school.The small restaurant was already half-full with people. He Zhao pushed the door open and went in. \u201cThis one, then. If we keep looking, evening self-study is going to end, and I haven\u2019t even finished copying my homework.\u201dXie Yu also ignored the people and walked in, found a seat, and sat down. He carefully used the napkin on the table to wipe down the bowls and chopsticks.He Zhao lifted a hand, saying, \u201cBoss, the menu?\u201dThe people inside didn\u2019t look too nice. Shen Jie\u2019s right eye started twitching and he couldn\u2019t stop it.He followed in, reflexively reaching for his pocket. Mm\u2026 his wallet was still there.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 63": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fake SlackersChapter 041 - Ah, it's fine.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayFake SlackersTranslator: JuryEditor: NomNomFirst Published on Chaleuria\u2014041 \u2013 Ah, it\u2019s fine.The Dian Ji students all wore grey gym uniforms with a vertical blue streak on one sleeve. Their uniform was their sign, and Erzhong students would give them a wide berth to avoid any unnecessary trouble if they saw them.Shen Jie held on to his pocket the whole time. He sat to one side and observed the restaurant as well as the people at the other tables.As He Zhao was flipping through the menu, someone at another table knocked on the table with a beer glass and said, like he was picking a fight, \u201cAnother carton of beer!\u201dShen Jie dragged his line of sight back to his own table and saw that his Zhao-ge was also looking at the available drinks. He Zhao\u2019s finger landed on the menu and he said, \u201cGreen bean soup?\u201dXie Yu\u2019s finger landed just under He Zhao\u2019s, less than half an inch away. \u201cI\u2019ll have this.\u201d\u201cMineral water again,\u201d He Zhao said. \u201cYour life is really boring, isn\u2019t it?\u201dShen Jie watched with wide eyes as they decided on drinks and started to select dishes. He felt as if he was invisible. A second later, he said, \u201cAre\u2026 neither of you going to ask me? What I want to drink?\u201d\u201cOrder for yourself what food and drinks you want.\u201d He Zhao didn\u2019t even raise his head, and turned to Xie Yu after he finished speaking. \u201cWill you eat this?\u201dDamn it, I should just not have come along for this meal. You two go and eat your fill.Shen Jie gripped his chopsticks tightly with complex feelings.The table next to them was very raucous, and the sounds of beer bottles being popped open occasionally reached their table. There was even a girl among them, wearing a very short miniskirt and a row of piercings along one ear. She had big hoop earrings and a loud voice.\u201cSis-in-law, when is Ji-ge coming? Come on, give him a call and hurry him up,\u201d someone said drunkenly, waving his beer bottle. \u201cWe\u2019ve already almost finished two rounds. If he still doesn\u2019t come\u2026 hic.\u201dBig hoop earrings picked up her phone from the table and said generously, \u201cRight, I\u2019ll rush him.\u201dShen Jie wasn\u2019t very picky about food either, but the two people opposite him were really getting to be too much. He Zhao ordered a bowl of noodles and specifically mentioned not to add spices. Shen Jie, unable to hold it in, interrupted. \u201cWhy not?\u201dThe moment he asked he regretted asking.He Zhao replied, \u201cMy little friend won\u2019t eat them.\u201dShen Jie: \u201c\u2026\u2026I\u2019m full. I haven\u2019t even eaten anything and I\u2019m full.\u201dWho could remember the long list of foods Xie Yu wouldn\u2019t eat, anyway?Xie Yu\u2019s appetite wasn\u2019t very good; he had been under the hot sun for a long time today. He ate several pieces of vegetables and half a bowl of noodles, then put down his chopsticks and went to the counter to pay.As he got up, someone entered the restaurant.Xie Yu saw the silhouette out of the corner of his eye and didn\u2019t pay much attention to it. He looked down at his phone, swiping in his passcode. \u201cA hundred and two?\u201dThe lady boss punched numbers into her calculator, looked at the bill, then did the sums over again for fear of collecting too little. Then she nodded and said, \u201cAye, that\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cJi-ge!\u201d The people at the neighboring table had also finished eating and now they all stood up, applauding as they welcomed the newcomer. \u201cYou\u2019re late! Finish these seven bottles! They\u2019ve been waiting for you for a long time and you have to drink them.\u201dThe newcomer also wore the Information Technology school uniform, the gym clothes big on him. Although he was tall, his looks were ordinary and one might not be able to pick him out of a crowd. But he had one identifying feature: a scar at his forehead, running from his hairline all the way down to his eyebrows.\u201cJi-ge.\u201d Shen Jie didn\u2019t dare look up and whispered. \u201cThe one from Dian Ji who stabbed someone?\u201dShen Jie didn\u2019t look up, so he hadn\u2019t seen the strange expression on He Zhao\u2019s face and how he had been about to take some food but stilled his hand. Then He Zhao put his chopsticks back on the table and didn\u2019t continue eating.Shen Jie was still murmuring: \u201cI think I heard Wan Da talk about him when discussing the top ten figures in Dian Ji. He\u2019s quite formidable. He has at least seven underlings, and when other people fight he squats on a trashcan lid to watch. That\u2019s why he\u2019s called Ji-ge.\u201d\u00b9Before Shen Jie had finished speaking, he noticed that \u2018one of the top ten figures in Dian Ji\u2019 was now standing beside him and not moving. He suddenly froze, and shot a glance downward through the space between his wrist and his elbow which was propped on the table. He saw a pair of Nike tennis shoes. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dShen Jie wondered if he had talked too loudly and been overheard, then started to think about the three of them: with Zhao-ge and Big Bro Yu\u2019s fighting skills, would they be able to win this fight?While he was still comparing tiers in his head, he heard Ji-ge say, \u201cHe Zhao?\u201dWhen Xie Yu had finished paying his bill and returned to the table, this was the scene he saw:The guy in the Dian Ji uniform had gotten a beer from someone and now stood opposite He Zhao, holding the mouth of the bottle to the side of the table. He exerted force and the bottlecap popped off and fell to the floor.It rolled around twice on the ground, cleanly, then fell.The person handed the bottle to He Zhao, his meaning unclear. \u201cGive me some face?\u201dHe Zhao didn\u2019t take it. With a smile he said, \u201cOld friend. We haven\u2019t seen each other in three years, so no need to be so enthusiastic.\u201dNeither had openly expressed enmity, and the challenge in their words could only be discerned if one listened very closely. But Xie Yu leaned against the wall and watched for a while. He could tell that He Zhao\u2019s smile was put on, and very false.\u201cJi-ge,\u201d someone from the neighboring table asked. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? You know him?\u201dThen they started chattering. \u201cLooking at the uniform he\u2019s from Erzhong.\u201dWhile sitting at the table He Zhao had had his back toward them, and when he had walked in they had been busy drinking and hadn\u2019t paid attention. Now that they looked more closely, one of them who was more familiar with Erzhong\u2019s \u2018famous figures\u2019 was surprised. \u201cDamn it, isn\u2019t this Erzhong\u2019s He Zhao?\u201dAs he finished, he lowered his voice and added, \u201c\u2026And the one over there, Xie Yu?\u201dJi-ge didn\u2019t keep pressing He Zhao to drink. He raised his head and drank it all himself. Amidst applause and cheers he wiped his mouth with one hand, then raised the empty bottle and said, \u201cIf you hadn\u2019t mentioned it, I wouldn\u2019t have remembered. Three years. Time does pass really damn fast.\u201dJi-ge took two steps forward. \u201cSince you remember it so well, do you remember what I said to you at that time? I said never show your face in front of me again. Remember?\u201dThe atmosphere up to this point had been somewhat ambiguous, but now it was clear that someone was trying to start a fight.The eight or nine people at the other two tables weren\u2019t content to just look on any more. They stood up, the sound of their chairs scraping against the floor making an earsplitting noise.He Zhao placed one hand on the table; he still wore his \u2018Love and Peace\u2019 vest, but the words seemed rather sarcastic under these circumstances. Just like the Black Water Street chat group that sent messages like, \u2018Fuck your mom, I\u2019ll kill your whole family,\u2019 all the time but named their chatroom \u2018Don\u2019t fight.\u2019After a moment, He Zhao said, \u201cSettle your fight with me. Let them leave first.\u201dShen Jie was among the \u2018them\u2019 He Zhao was referring to. He still held his chopsticks, unsure what to do. But even an idiot could tell that the atmosphere wasn\u2019t right, so he put down his chopsticks and said, \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere. We\u2019re bros, so how can I leave at this time? Zhao-ge, there\u2019s nothing to fear. We\u2019ll meet them head on, and we have Old Xie here who can take seven of them.\u201dIf this were a different scenario, He Zhao would have patted his shoulder and said, \u201cYou call him Old Xie, too?\u201dBut He Zhao only said, \u201cHead-on my ass. This has nothing to do with you. Leave now.\u201d\u201cBros?\u201d Ji-ge laughed. The word seemed to have hit a nerve. His laughter was very exaggerated; he clutched his stomach and bent over and didn\u2019t stop for a long time. He raised one hand to wipe tears from his eyes and said, \u201c\u2026Little friend, you treat him as a bro, but do you know what your Zhao-ge\u2019s best at?\u201dAs Ji-ge spoke, his words slowed and eventually he paused for several seconds before saying, \u201cHe\u2019s best at stabbing his bros in the back.\u201dHe Zhao said nothing.Or it could be said that the whole restaurant suddenly fell into an inexplicable silence.The two stood face to face. Clearly, something had happened here\u2014a lot had happened here and it looked quite exciting. Even Shen Jie couldn\u2019t help trying to imagine: how had He Zhao stabbed his bro in the back?Xie Yu leaned against the wall, looking on as if watching a show. Then Shen Jie heard Old Xie\u2014Old Xie who had negative interest in gossip and who could take seven on in one go\u2014say lazily, \u201cDon\u2019t spout rubbish. I don\u2019t want to hear it. Do you want to go one by one or all at once?\u201dJi-ge: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dSo the fight happened after all. Xie Yu\u2019s skill at provoking others was top notch.No one was sure who flipped the table first, but the dishes and the beer bottles all shattered on the ground.Xie Yu fought with a chair. Seeing that Shen Jie was surrounded by three people, he finished off his side of things in a few blows and let go of the chair, which crashed into the ground with a bang. Then he kicked it over and it rammed into the three people\u2019s calves.This lot was terrible. No challenge at all. Only the girl among them was a little troublesome\u2014he couldn\u2019t touch her, and on top of that he had to worry about accidentally injuring her.The restaurant\u2019s lady boss had dared open her shop near Dian Ji so she was clearly familiar with the ways of the world. She didn\u2019t turn a hair as she continued pressing keys on her calculator by the counter, starting to tally up how much she would need to ask of them for compensation.He Zhao and Ji-ge went one-on-one. At first, He Zhao was clearly holding back and didn\u2019t retaliate, but Ji-ge was not about to let him off so easily. As if venting his frustration, each of his blows was fiercer than the last.He Zhao didn\u2019t have the patience of a saint, either, and even he was a little annoyed after several rounds. \u201cAre you done?\u201dJi-ge said something only the two of them could hear, and then He Zhao went all out with his fists.\u201cYou\u2019re a damn fucking good-for-nothing, He Zhao.\u201d Ji-ge took a fist to the stomach and fell down. He caught himself on the back of a chair, then smiled, long and meaningful. \u201c\u2026You\u2019re in Erzhong now?\u201dHe Zhao\u2019s retaliatory punch seemed to have sapped all the strength from his body, and the memories of the past that were screaming for attention in his mind now left him dazed.A vein was throbbing at his temple.He stood frozen to the spot for a long time until Xie Yu called, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dOn the way back, no one spoke.Xie Yu really had no interest in this matter\u2026 or it shouldn\u2019t be said that he had zero interest. If He Zhao was willing to explain, then he would listen. If it were anyone else, he probably wouldn\u2019t even hear them out.Xie Yu suddenly realized that He Zhao had become an exception to him at some point.At the crossroads, Shen Jie had to say goodbye and broke the silence. He waved to them and said, \u201cI\u2019ll go back. You be careful on the way home.\u201d\u201cAnd your injuries?\u201d He Zhao stuck his hands in his pockets as he stood under the streetlight. \u201c\u2026How are you going to explain to your mom when you get home?\u201dShen Jie touched the small scrape on his face. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. I\u2019ll say I fell.\u201dHe Zhao took his hand out of his pocket and waved back. \u201cGo home. And be careful.\u201dXie Yu stared at He Zhao\u2019s face in profile, a little dazed.He Zhao was clearly emotionally a wreck, but he was still worrying about whether Shen Jie would get yelled at when he got home.Evening self-study was about to end so there was no point going back to class. If they got caught they\u2019d even get reprimanded for repeated offences. So the two of them went straight back to the dorms. Before they entered the building, He Zhao suddenly said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cSorry for what?\u201d\u201cJust, today\u2019s dinner.\u201d He Zhao scratched his head. \u201cHow it turned out.\u201dBy the time He Zhao got to his room door, he seemed to have calmed down to his normal state, and even smiled as he told his little friend to rest early.Xie Yu asked him, \u201cYou all right?\u201dAt Xie Yu\u2019s words, He Zhao was stunned for a moment, then he said, \u201cAh, I\u2019m fine.\u201dIt sounded like the truth.If Xie Yu hadn\u2019t gotten up in the middle of the night to go to the toilet and seen He Zhao sitting in the stairwell smoking, he might even have believed it.The handsome devil sat on the highest step, a cigarette hanging between his fingers. When he took a drag, the light at the end of the cigarette suddenly flared, dancing in the darkness.The motion sensor lights in the stairwell hadn\u2019t come on, and the stairwell was lit only very faintly by the lights from the corridor.Then the handsome devil looked down and slowly exhaled a mouthful of smoke. His movements were practiced, and when the cigarette was half gone he stubbed it out and prepared to get up. When he looked up, he saw his cold little friend standing in the stairwell entrance.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

For some reason, he felt as if he had been caught doing something bad. After a second of silence, he said, \u201cYou haven\u2019t been good\u2026 you\u2019re not asleep yet?\u201dProbably because he had been smoking, He Zhao\u2019s voice sounded very hoarse. Pitched low and deep, even his tone descended as he spoke.As he finished speaking, he let go and the cigarette fell onto the floor. Then he went quiet again.This was the first time Xie Yu was seeing He Zhao do this. Or, should he say, this was his first time seeing He Zhao in this state.When he met He Zhao, the idiot had already quit smoking. He ate lollipops all day and kept the stick in his mouth. Now Xie Yu smelled the nicotine in the air and wondered, what had the Big Bro of the East Building whose name struck fear into people\u2019s hearts been like?Had he been like this?His spirits seemed low, but he still had a strong presence, even an air of tyranny. He seemed a little tired, as if he was in a bad mood.\u201cI\u2019m going to the bathroom.\u201d Xie Yu used He Zhao\u2019s excuse from before, but a stronger version of it. He turned around and said, \u201cYou, damn it, stay right there and don\u2019t go anywhere.\u201dHe Zhao made an \u201cAh\u201d of acknowledgement. Only after Xie Yu had walked past him did he wonder out loud, \u201cWhy did you come all this way to go to the bathroom?\u201dEverything else aside, Erzhong\u2019s dormitories were famously good. All the dorm rooms had their own thermostats and private bathrooms, and the rooms themselves were spacious.Xie Yu\u2019s voice came from far away. \u201cLeaking pipe. Reported to maintenance.\u201dHe Zhao sat on the stairs and didn\u2019t move.He had gone to bed very early. He had gone to his room, showered, and lain down, but then he had jolted awake from a dream covered in a cold sweat. And then, on this beautiful autumn night, he\u2019d tossed and turned, unable to go back to sleep.Ringing in his ears were the words Lei Jun had suddenly bent down and said into his ear at the restaurant. \u201cHe Zhao, you left Erlei in such a state. Why haven\u2019t you killed yourself?\u201dEven in his dreams he felt an invisible hand at his throat, choking him so he couldn\u2019t say a word.He Zhao glanced down and toyed with the lighter in his hand. With a click, a small flame shot out.He released his thumb. The spot where his thumb pressed down felt slightly warm, like a fire was burning upwards from his fingertips.Lei Jun was now Ji-ge, a fourth-year at the Information Technology school. He had been held back one year. He couldn\u2019t be considered a school tyrant, but he\u2019d attended the school long enough that the previous Dian Ji \u2018big bros\u2019 had pretty much all left, so the burden now fell to him.Although they were enemies now, before\u2026 they had been as thick as thieves.In junior high, He Zhao had been popular and made many friends, but had only a few close friends. He had met Lei Jun at a concession stand where Lei Jun was drinking a bottle of soda, as if it were alcohol, after going through a breakup. Another boy stood beside him, consoling him. \u201cGirls come and go, but I, your bro, will always be here.\u201dLei Jun said, \u201cErlei, you like me? But I don\u2019t like men.\u201dThat was how they met.Lei Jun and Fang Xiaolei both got such bad grades that the teachers stopped bothering about them. As long as they weren\u2019t a bad influence on the other students, the teachers closed one eye and let things slide.And He Zhao, at the start, had really been the hope of the village. He had been a promising, exceptional student in everyone\u2019s eyes.Seeing a promising student like He Zhao get involved with two bad students, all the teachers were heartbroken, especially his homeroom teacher. \u201cDon\u2019t associate with them so much. You\u2019re not the same as they are.\u201dHow terrible could junior high students be? They hadn\u2019t even begun to mix with the bad side of society. Their grades were poor, that was all.He Zhao always said, \u201cTeacher, hypothetically speaking\u2026 if I were to go down the wrong path, that\u2019s no one\u2019s fault but mine. And I\u2019m doing all right now, aren\u2019t I? Can you not be prejudiced toward the other students?\u201dHe Zhao thought about it, then he suddenly lay back, hands crossed behind his neck.His clothes were thin, and he felt a cool breeze slip under the fabric at his lower back as he moved.He hadn\u2019t been lying down for very long when Xie Yu finished washing his hands, crossed the stairwell, and sat down next to him. \u201cGot lollipops?\u201dHe Zhao thought Xie Yu wanted one. \u201cPocket. There\u2019s one left. Look for it.\u201dSeeing the handsome devil had no intention of moving, Xie Yu reached out to get it. \u201cWhich side?\u201dHe Zhao said, \u201cThe left, probably.\u201dHe Zhao was wearing only a short-sleeved t-shirt on his upper body, clearly without any pockets. Xie Yu reached halfway across He Zhao then paused.He Zhao had remembered wrongly. He thought he was still wearing the \u2018Love and Peace\u2019 vest whose pocket he had stuffed a handful of lollipops into when he left his dorm room in the morning. When Xie Yu\u2019s hand lightly touched the top of his thigh through his pants, the shock finally jolted his memory.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe Zhao wore a low-waisted pair of jeans. Black and frayed in places.Xie Yu looked down, hands fumbling in He Zhao\u2019s pockets for a long time. He didn\u2019t find anything, but he did feel the person next to him growing more rigid.He Zhao couldn\u2019t lie down any longer. He sat up, subconsciously catching Xie Yu\u2019s wrist. His skin was warm, and the jutting bone of his wrist landed in He Zhao\u2019s palm.He internally cursed.\u201cI remembered wrong,\u201d He Zhao said. \u201cNo sweets, they\u2019re all in my room. If you want one, I\u2026\u201dHe Zhao didn\u2019t finish before scrambling up from the floor, palms against the ground. Then he walked down the stairs two at a time, skipping the last steps entirely and leaping onto the landing, the hem of his shirt lifting in the wind.As if he was flying.Xie Yu sat on the stairs, internally wondering how mad this guy had gone this time.After several minutes, He Zhao came back holding a metal can. Quite a big one. Even bigger than the can Xie Yu had seen on his desk in his dorm room. He had probably brought his entire stock with him.An assortment of all kinds of flavors met Xie Yu\u2019s eyes.He Zhao took off the cover and handed it to Xie Yu. \u201cHere.\u201d Take all of them.Xie Yu took the can, balancing it on his knees. He attentively sorted through them for a long time before pulling out a strawberry-flavored one.He Zhao just watched as his cold little friend unwrapped the lollipop. Then, unexpectedly, he heard a word from Xie Yu\u2019s lips. He even dragged out the sound. \u201cAhh.\u201dHe Zhao: \u201cAh?\u201dHe Zhao had just opened his mouth when Xie Yu stuffed the lollipop in, quickly and accurately. The sweet and cloying taste spread on He Zhao\u2019s tongue, washing away the bitter taste of tobacco.\u201cEat it, little friend.\u201d Xie Yu seemed to be quite happy at finally being able to retaliate for the nickname \u2018little friend,\u2019 his lips curving into a faint smile. But his tone was habitually chilly. \u201cAnd remember to brush your teeth when you\u2019re done.\u201dHe Zhao was stunned for a moment, only reacting when he heard the bit about brushing his teeth. With the lollipop still in his mouth, he said, \u201cYou\u2026\u201dHe cut himself off halfway. \u201cForget it. I\u2019ll let you win this once.\u201dWhen He Zhao had come back, the light turned on by the motion sensor had gone out again.After a while, Xie Yu asked, \u201cThat piece of trash. Old friend of yours?\u201d\u201cJi-ge? His name is Lei Jun,\u201d He Zhao said. \u201cJunior high schoolmates. He\u2019s not bad, but he and I\u2026 have some history.\u201dI could tell.Xie Yu thought, if it was over a stupid grudge, they wouldn\u2019t have been able to leave so easily. A fight is fair. You brawl and then you go your separate ways.He\u2019d seen many grudge-holders on Black Water Street; they wouldn\u2019t leave you be, even after you made phone calls to get your friends as back-up. Like a bad band-aid, they couldn\u2019t be ripped off without also losing some of your skin in the process.Be more ruthless than them, or more stupid than them, and they\u2019ll be afraid of you.Xie Yu didn\u2019t keep asking and He Zhao wasn\u2019t sure what to say.\u2014Actually, I\u2019m a supergenius. I\u2019m faking my bad grades. If he said it, he\u2019d probably be beaten to death.He Zhao thought about it and thought some more. As if possessed, words from the past started echoing in his ears again.\u201cHe Zhao, I\u2019ll solve this problem for you. Just focus on preparing for exams and win glory for the school.\u201dHis homeroom teacher\u2019s face was a little blurry in his mind, but she was clearly smiling. \u201cI understand you. I know you\u2019re a good kid and this was an accident. Besides, you didn\u2019t do it on purpose\u2026 Don\u2019t think about it too much.\u201dHe Zhao slowly closed his eyes, then opened them again. Xie Yu was getting up, about to go back to his dorm room to sleep.He Zhao wasn\u2019t sure what he was thinking when he reached out to catch them hem of Xie Yu\u2019s shirt. When he touched the soft material, he finally came back to his senses and let go.Xie Yu hadn\u2019t gotten stable footing on the stairs and now that He Zhao let go, he lost his balance and grit out as he fell, \u201c\u2026He Zhao, are you goddamn sick or what?\u201dThe next day.Luo Wenqiang was gving pep talks to the participants who had yet to participate in any events, and mentioned his hopes for the 3000m boys\u2019 long distance event. He already assumed that they had first and second place in the bag.\u201cThis time, our class has got it for sure. We\u2019re the best in the year, all right? Even though our cultural quotient is negative, at least we\u2019re good at gym! With Zhao-ge and Yu-ge\u2026\u201dBefore he finished, he saw He Zhao helping Xie Yu through the back door.\u201c\u2026The two of you, uh, our two long distance runners.\u201d Luo Wenqiang swallowed. \u201cWhat happened to you?\u201dA medicinal patch was stuck on Xie Yu\u2019s ankle and his pant leg was folded up. He leaned against He Zhao and pointed at him. \u201cAsk him.\u201d\u201cIt really wasn\u2019t on purpose.\u201d He Zhao carefully held Xie Yu\u2019s waist and said, \u201cDoes it hurt? Do you want to go to the doctor\u2019s office again? Or back to the dorm?\u201dXie Yu said, \u201cI want you to shut up.\u201dSo He Zhao was the lone man standing for the long distance event.As they carried chairs downstairs, Luo Wenqiang was still grieving. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have joked about it. What hopes of the whole village? Now he really is the village\u2019s one and only hope.\u201dHe Zhao carried one chair in each hand. He\u2019d come back later to get his little friend, too.Luo Wenqiang said, \u201cZhao-ge, tell me, can I believe in you, Zhao-ge?\u201d\u201cFirst place, right? No problem.\u201d When they got to the quad, He Zhao put the chairs down. \u201cQiangqiang, rest assured. I\u2019m not fighting alone. I still have the spirit of my deskmate with me.\u201d\u201cThe remaining events for today are the long jump finals, the 100m finals, the boys\u2019 3000m long distance, the 100m relay, and the group event, the tug-of-war\u2026. And lastly, the teachers\u2019 400m race.\u201d Dean Jiang started his pep talk again. \u201cLooking at everyone running around on the quad, I feel very happy. This is how youths should be! Do your best, athletes!\u201dXie Yu sat in his seat, looking down at his phone. On his head lay the big jacket He Zhao had forcibly put on his head, saying it was to block out the sun.The 3000m long distance run was always the most anticipated and the longest in duration. In a little while, He Zhao would have to go to the flagpoles to report in. Before he left, he said very confidently, \u201cYou all can start thinking about what to say in the acceptance speech when we win first place.\u201dWan Da applauded. \u201cFirst place for sure.\u201dLiu Cunhao said, \u201cImpressive. We\u2019re counting on you, Zhao-ge.\u201dXie Yu kicked him with his uninjured leg. \u201cCut the crap and get lost.\u201dHe Zhao went and the numbers 4286 on his back shone in the sunlight.When He Zhao had gone, Luo Wenqiang and the others got together to discuss the script to cheer for Class 3\u2019s only long distance runner. They put their heads together and discussed it for a while. Wan Da turned. \u201cYu-ge, take a look at this for us. Will this do?\u201dXie Yu took it and found that it wasn\u2019t any sort of encouraging script to be announced over the intercom, but the prize acceptance script He Zhao had requested.On it was Liu Cunhao\u2019s handwriting, leaning in all directions.Victory to Zhao-ge and to Class 3. Thank you to the other participants for participating in the long distance event. Very regretfully, and very helplessly, you only turned out to be small supporting actors with no speaking lines in this wonderful drama.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dLiu Cunhao blinked and asked, \u201cHow about that! Talented, aren\u2019t I.\u201d\u201cThick-skinned and shameless. After the sports meet, someone might put a sack over your head and beat you up.\u201d Xie Yu paused, then continued, \u201cBut your Zhao-ge will definitely like it.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

On the way back, they yelled to He Zhao across the track. \u201cZhao-ge, do your best! We have a surprise for you!\u201dNot many people had signed up for the long distance event. There were only one or two from each class, and all of them had been forced to join. No one really wanted to run that many laps. For the shorter-distance events, they could sprint and show off, but for the 3000m event, all they could show off was how to pant heavily and suffer a fate worse than death.He Zhao stood at the back of the line, the most eye-catching of the lot.Hearing someone call his name, He Zhao turned around and made a \u2018No problem\u2019 handsign, then raised his voice. \u201cFriend, tell me the secret?\u201d\u201cVery secret.\u201d Wan Da wagged a finger. \u201cAt that time, you\u2019ll know.\u201dLuo Wenqiang followed up, \u201cDon\u2019t forget! You\u2019re carrying Yu-ge\u2019s spirit, too!\u201dHe Zhao stood in place. He watchedenthusiastic, energetic classmates returning to their assigned seats, then looked away from them, his gaze landing on someone in the last row.Xie Yu was looking down at his phone, refreshing his social media feed. He tapped \u2018like\u2019 a few times, which Dalei immediately screenshotted and sent to the \u2018Don\u2019t fight\u2019 group, along with the caption, Missing person @xy, good to see you.Only now did Xie Yu discover he hadn\u2019t posted a status update in a long time.He wasn\u2019t in the habit of recording his life, but now there were all sorts of background noises making a ruckus all around him. Each class cheered on their representatives, some screaming, some consoling: \u201cIt\u2019s all right. You already did very well. The important part is participating\u2026\u201dXie Yu opened his camera app, about to take a picture for participation\u2019s sake, but when he raised his camera and adjusted the angle, he discovered in the frame a certain handsome devil, surname He, first name Zhao. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe handsome devil was exaggerating his movements and his expression. He faced the camera, right hand tugging at his collar and a smile on his lips, very obviously posing for the camera, both confident and cool.He was clearly an old hand at posing.Xie Yu\u2019s finger slipped and he nearly closed out of the app.What a madman.So many tricks up his sleeve.\u2026Who the hell wants to take your picture?Xie Yu resisted the impulse to throw his phone, but seeing He Zhao hold his pose for half a minute without moving\u2014that endurance was impressive\u2014he hit the camera button after all.Terrified that He Zhao would get hooked on having his picture taken and pose several more times, Xie Yu stuffed his phone back in his pocket the moment he finished.After a while, when He Zhao was getting in line on the track, Xie Yu took his phone out again and unlocked it. On the screen was the photograph from before.With the light shining at their backs, the human subjects were slightly cast in shadow, but the youth in the center was still radiant and eye-catching.\u201cMen\u2019s 3000m, prepare\u2014\u201dA gunshot heralded the beginning of the 3000m event.The dozen or so participants had their toes on the white line, and at the sound of the gun, they dashed forth.\u201cI\u2019m not worried about everyone else, but in the class next door there\u2019s a guy with damn good stamina. He represented the school before. That one, number five.\u201d Luo Wenqiang stuck his head out and looked around, seeming a little worried. \u201c\u2026Why is Zhao-ge running so quickly at the start? Pace yourself.\u201dWan Da: \u201cGym rep, let\u2019s think of it a different way. He\u2019s strong.\u201d\u201cStrong my ass.\u201d Xie Yu had finished looking through his friend group on the chat and caught the tail end of Wan Da\u2019s words. He looked up and said, \u201cHe\u2019s attention-seeking.\u201dLiu Cunhao applauded and said, \u201cCan\u2019t deny that.\u201dHe Zhao ran in front, a full half-lap in front of the other runners. The eyes of the entire school were on him as he lapped the quad.Several girls from the neighboring class were chattering. \u201cReally, only 3000m? I want to see him run a few more laps. So cool.\u201dXie Yu leaned back and narrowed his eyes. For some reason he was frustrated.\u2026What was there to look at, anyway?\u201cHe\u2019s coming, he\u2019s coming!\u201d Luo Wenqiang had brought a stool to sit right behind Xie Yu, and every time he saw He Zhao coming their way, he led the class in a group cheer to cheer him on. He was so excited he couldn\u2019t even sit properly on the stool; he hovered in a half-squat over it and counted backwards. \u201cThree, two, one. Do it neatly! Shout out the energy of our whole class!\u201dWhen He Zhao was nearing them, Luo Wenqiang led them in a cheer. \u201cClass 3\u2019s the best! Zhao-ge beats the rest!\u201dRepeated three whole times.When He Zhao passed by Class 3 he slowed his pace and caught hold of the hem of his vest. He was probably feeling warm after having run four laps. As he ran he took off the vest, and the girls in the audience stand started aah-ing again.When He Zhao was done stripping he yelled, \u201cOld Xie!\u201dBefore Xie Yu could react, He Zhao had already tossed the article of clothing in his direction, as if passing a ball. It landed right by Xie Yu\u2019s feet and He Zhao said as he used his thin inner shirt to mop at his sweat, \u201cKeep that for me.\u201dThe jacket still held the lingering warmth of his body and the faint scent of detergent.Xie Yu held on to He Zhao\u2019s jacket. When there was one lap left in the 3000m event, Class 3\u2019s announcement was finally picked out of the pile. Perhaps the broadcasters had finally run out of announcements and were forced to read this terrible submission.\u201cAnnouncement from Class 2.3. Victory to Zhao-ge, to Class 3.\u201dThe announcer was a senior girl from the school committee, with a lively voice and crisp enunciation, who was deliberately imitating a news broadcaster. She read this far, then stopped. A few seconds later she continued, hesitantly. \u201cThank you to the other participants for participating. Very regretfully, uh, and very helplessly\u2026\u201dBy the time she had finished reading, the whole stadium was quiet.At the words \u2018small supporting role\u2019 He Zhao stopped dead, about 100m from the finish line. Very obviously the manner a winner. Playing along with Class 3\u2019s announcement, he waved to the audience in apology.Clearly seeking attention again.He Zhao was a full half lap ahead of second place anyway, so Liu Cunhao and the others played along with He Zhao\u2019s act.So the eyes of the whole school were on He Zhao as he stopped before the finish line, hands on his knees as he panted for breath and asked in a hoarse voice, \u201cWho\u2019s first place?\u201dThe students of Class 3 yelled, \u201c\u2014He Zhao!\u201d\u201cLouder?\u201d\u201cHe Zhao!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe Zhao was clearly very immersed in this act and had dragged all of Class 2.3 along with him. The tackiness was thick in the air and he was so confident it was almost blinding.Out of secondhand embarrassment, Xie Yu couldn\u2019t keep watching. He looked down at the photo editor on his phone, adjusting the brightness of the photo he had taken just now. When he looked up again, the long distance runner from the neighboring class was taking advantage of the opportunity while Class 2.3 was posturing wildly to speed up and bypass the drama king without a sound, dashing toward the finish line. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dClass 2.3 didn\u2019t win first place, but they made their name in the history books of Liyang Erzhong for absolutely unbelievable embarrassment.Xie Yu glanced at his seat, then at the distance to the neighboring class, and thought very hard about moving his seat closer to them\u2026 he really couldn\u2019t bear the embarrassment of that person.Class 3\u2019s homeroom teacher was a little more open-minded. Throughout the sequence of events, Tang Sen maintained a smile. \u201cInteresting. Young people are so interesting.\u201dThe few classmates who\u2019d most ardently played along now sat in their seats, bent double at the waist, faces buried in their knees as they tried to hide.\u201cWhat does he mean \u2018interesting,\u2019\u201d Luo Wenqiang said, hands over his head. \u201cDamn it, this is so embarrassing.\u201dWan Da\u2019s muffled voice came, \u201cSo embarrassing I could die.\u201dLiu Cunhao said, \u201cStop talking about it. I\u2019m already dead.\u201dHe Zhao went to the bathroom to wash his face. Since he had perspired so much, he splashed cool water over his head, too, and the water flowed downwards over his neck. By the time he came back, his collar was soaked through. He sat down and said, \u201cListen to me. That was an accident. My real skills\u2026\u201dXie Yu grabbed a bottle of mineral water and chucked it at He Zhao. \u201cAttention-seeking skills?\u201dHe Zhao grabbed the bottle and gulped half of it down at once, then continued, \u201cThat really was an accident. I\u2019m really very good. Did you see how I was ahead by half a lap? I left everyone else in the dust.\u201d\u201cBig bro flirt,\u201d Xie Yu said, \u201cCan you shut up?\u201dThe last event was the teachers\u2019 race.Everyone was here to watch the show. After all, during the day-to-day, they only saw the teachers at the podium delivering lectures.\u201cThis counts towards class points, right?\u201d He Zhao twisted the bottle closed and moved closer to Xie Yu. \u201cIf Old Tang gets first place, our class might\u2026\u201d \u2026Might still be salvageable.Xie Yu said, \u201cThink about how Old Wu played soccer. Use that as reference.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d He Zhao changed his mind. \u201cForget it. Pretend I said nothing.\u201dClass 2.3 didn\u2019t hold any groundless hopes for Tang Sen.By the time the other teachers finished the 400m race, their Old Tang had only run halfway; no one thought this was anything out of the ordinary.Awkwardness was quick to come and quick to go. Especially for He Zhao, who hadn\u2019t the slightest notion of shame: he led the whole class in selective amnesia and started madly cheering for Old Tang. \u201cDo your best! Finishing is winning!\u201dOld Tang didn\u2019t let everyone\u2019s hopes down either. He solidly occupied last place.Close to dismissal time, all the events had ended.Liu Cunhao got up and yelled, \u201cEveryone clean up your trash,\u201d and Luo Wenqiang reminded everyone to return the number tags and safety pins to him.All around was the sound of the various classes dragging their chairs back to the classrooms.The word \u2018dismissed\u2019 often gives people a very strong surreal feeling. Xie Yu sat in his seat and watched the crowd disperse around him, the chairs also being cleared.The sports meet seemed to have just begun, or perhaps like it had never happened at all.While he was in a daze, He Zhao patted the back of his head.\u201cLet\u2019s go, little friend.\u201d He Zhao carried his chair under one arm, the other hand held out to Xie Yu. \u201cLet\u2019s go back to class.\u201d\u201cActually, we did pretty well. Third or fourth place,\u201d Luo Wenqiang said as he collected the tags in the classroom. \u201cAh, when I got back, next door\u2019s class rep laughed at me. Said, \u2018First place, right?\u2019\u201dThe sports meet had ended and now, mentioning this event only made everyone want to laugh. Someone took the lead, then the whole class began to laugh.He Zhao couldn\u2019t restrain himself, either. He held one hand to his mouth, leaned backwards, and laughed for a long time.Wan Da had already begun recounting the event as if it were ancient history. \u201cAt that time\u2026 my god, I don\u2019t even dare remember it. I really\u2014I was so overcome with emotion. I closed my eyes and yelled \u2018Zhao-ge the Winner,\u2019 but when I opened my eyes, that guy from next door had already dashed past the finish line\u2026\u201dXie Yu held in his laughter and looked down, copying the work, but his handwriting was a little shaky.Dean Jiang heard the noise and came over. He Zhao glimpsed his face, expression grave and gaze sharp, through the window, and quickly caught hold of Xie Yu\u2019s hand, stuffing both his hand and the workbook under the desk. \u201cMad Dog.\u201dMad Dog walked in and made several rounds of the classroom. \u201cI knew you couldn\u2019t restrain yourselves. When it\u2019s time to play, you can play, but when it\u2019s time to be serious, you have to be serious. Really, no self-control at all. Discipline, it\u2019s a discipline problem. How many times have I said it? Are you really that happy? If you\u2019re that happy then tell me about it. Let me be happy too.\u201dBoth Xie Yu\u2019s hand and his workbook were kept under the desk by He Zhao\u2019s hand. The whole class was sitting still, unmoving, and Mad Dog was in the area so He Zhao couldn\u2019t move for the time being, either.Xie Yu had his palm on the workbook and the cool steel surface of the desk, but the back of his hand was burning.Both of them were wearing unnatural expressions. Or perhaps Mad Dog had finally noticed that the two students in the last row had their hands stacked together under the desk doing who knows what.Mad Dog stopped his spiel about discipline. \u201cThe two of you, what are you doing?\u201dWho knew what He Zhao was thinking. To cover up for his deskmate copying homework, he brought their linked hands from under the table to the surface. Under the eyes of the curious audience, he said, \u201cWe\u2019re\u2026 holding hands.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

These two were obviously up to something more than just holding hands, but he had been temporarily stunned by He Zhao\u2019s antics and didn\u2019t have the presence of mind to check the interior of the desk. \u201c\u2026You two. All right. Sure. Holding hands, are you.\u201dHe Zhao\u2019s lips moved\u2014he might have intended to follow up with something even more shameless.While Mad Dog was distracted, Xie Yu stepped on He Zhao\u2019s foot. This action was completely merciless and He Zhao was in so much pain his hand subconsciously tightened around Xie Yu\u2019s. He said, in pain, \u201cCripple, you\u2019re so vicious?\u201dXie Yu whispered, \u201cIf my leg wasn\u2019t goddamn injured, you wouldn\u2019t even be here right now.\u201dMad Dog didn\u2019t hear what they were saying and only observed that not only were these two male students still holding hands, their grip grew tighter and tighter.Obviously posturing in front of him.He felt that his authority as discipline head was being held in contempt.\u201cSince you like holding hands so much, then keep holding hands! Until class is dismissed!\u201dMad Dog\u2019s chest was heaving. These two had greatly angered him. In order to salvage his authority, he turned to the other students and said, \u201cYou all watch them carefully. Until the dismissal bell rings, they\u2019re not allowed to let go. I\u2019ll come back later to check.\u201dHe Zhao: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dXie Yu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe other students, upon whom had been placed a great responsibility: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWhen Mad Dog left, Liu Cunhao poked Wan Da and asked hesitantly, \u201cDo we\u2026 really have to watch them?\u201dMad Dog often came up with creative and arcane methods of punishment. Once, when Liu Cunhao had been late, he had climbed over the wall to school\u2014he had heard from other students that it was an easy feat, so he had plucked up his courage and climbed. But on the other side was Mad Dog, eating breakfast and drinking soymilk. Liu Cunhao had been caught and made to climb the wall back and forth over twenty times.But this was too bizarre, surely\u2026 how could they keep watch, of two people holding hands at that?Compared to Liu Cunhao, Wan Da was much calmer. He serenely flipped open his English book and said, \u201cActually, I think we probably don\u2019t need to watch them.\u201dIn the last row.Although Xie Yu couldn\u2019t use one of his legs, his battle prowess was still frightening. The moment Mad Dog set one foot out the door, Class 3 immediately grew raucous. Xie Yu and He Zhao had both flipped their chairs and fallen onto the floor. Passersby who didn\u2019t know what had transpired would have been shocked.\u201cOld Xie, you can hit me, it\u2019s fine,\u201d He Zhao said as he dodged. \u201cBut we have to think of our classmates. If Mad Dog comes back to check on us, we can\u2019t implicate them\u2026 Do you understand what I\u2019m saying?\u201dRegardless of how angry Xie Yu was, He Zhao didn\u2019t let go of his hand the entire time. Xie Yu couldn\u2019t shake him off if he tried. He was so annoyed his head hurt. \u201cUnderstand, my ass.\u201dAt first, Liu Cunhao hadn\u2019t understood what Wan Da had meant by saying, \u201cWe don\u2019t need to keep watch.\u201dNow, after having observed for a little while, he finally understood. He patted Wan Da\u2019s shoulder and said, \u201cYou\u2019re really impressive\u2026 your predictions are as accurate as a seer\u2019s.\u201dWan Da cupped a fist in salute. \u201cHigh praise, high praise. I just know too much.\u201dThe fight didn\u2019t last long.He Zhao was focused on supporting the little cripple, worried that he\u2019d lose his footing and fall.He Zhao was dressed lightly today. His back was to the wall, one hand still gripping Xie Yu\u2019s, the other holding Xie Yu\u2019s waist. He looked down and said, \u201cAll right, all right. Don\u2019t move too much. I won\u2019t dodge. Hit me as much as you want.\u201dHis tone was really as if he was coaxing a child.Then, as He Zhao had wished, he took a solid beating.\u201cNow let us enter Class 2.3. I am your most beloved class rep\u2026\u201d During the two days of the sports meet, Liu Cunhao had brought his camera from home and taken many photos and videos. Now he started the footage rolling on himself, then turned the camera to face the class, sweeping its lens from left to right before stopping on the corner of the last row. \u201c\u2026In the corner, our Zhao-ge, being awarded his daily beating.\u201dLiu Cunhao hadn\u2019t been recording for very long when Wan Da suddenly came close, occupying the whole viewport with his face. \u201cHello, everybody\u2026\u201dWan Da had just begun when Liu Cunhao pushed his head to one side dismissively. \u201cGet out of the way and chill.\u201dThere were still more than ten minutes left to the dismissal bell.The subject teachers each came around to assign homework, and the assignments filled up half the blackboard. It washed away the wild, free atmosphere of the two days of no classes during the sports meet.\u201cThere\u2019s so much.\u201d\u201cThis is too much homework, surely\u2026\u201dThe English teacher finished writing, put the chalk back in the box, then clapped her hands to dust off the chalk. She said, \u201cI want you all to wake up. You\u2019ve played too much.\u201dShe gave a few more reminders, then turned to go back to the faculty office. Before leaving, she suddenly remembered that one student still hadn\u2019t turned in the mock paper she had assigned two days ago. So she stopped again and asked from the doorway, \u201cHe Zhao, where is your homework?\u201dHe Zhao raised his voice. \u201cI need a little more time.\u201dThe English teacher was about to say, Then I might as well stop teaching, but then she caught sight of He Zhao and Xie Yu holding hands. \u201c\u2026What are you doing?\u201dXie Yu\u2019s expression was blank. He coughed once and He Zhao, reading the mood, didn\u2019t say anything.In the end it was Liu Cunhao who said, \u201cTeacher, the two of them are\u2026 holding hands. Dean Jiang said they must hold hands until the end of class.\u201dThe English teacher asked, \u201cWhat are you doing? Being affectionate?\u201d\u201cRight, right, right. Demonstrating our class team spirit and love for each other.\u201dAlthough He Zhao was very susceptible to a soft touch and usually folded so quickly he could hardly keep his dignity intact, he was still very stubborn on the subject of holding hands and wouldn\u2019t let go no matter what.Xie Yu was thoroughly defeated. \u201cMad Dog isn\u2019t around.\u201d\u201cHe comes and goes like a phantom,\u201d He Zhao said. \u201cWe have to be ready at all times.\u201dAfter a while, Xie Yu moved his hand. \u201cI need to copy homework,\u201d he said, looking for an excuse. \u201cLet go. I haven\u2019t finished yesterday\u2019s homework.\u201dXie Yu sat on the left and had his right hand held. He couldn\u2019t write with his left hand.But He Zhao took the opportunity to demonstrate a principle to him: You have no idea how shameless Big Bro Flirt can be when he wants to!\u201cI\u2019ll swap seats with you,\u201d He Zhao said. \u201cSit in my seat.\u201dIn the end, they really did swap seats.Xie Yu sat in He Zhao\u2019s seat, pen in hand, copying Wan Da\u2019s homework. When he finished the first question, he discovered that he had copied the wrong answer.He Zhao sat to the other side, tapping at his phone with his left hand.Neither of them spoke.But the atmosphere\u2026 the atmosphere was very strange.The background noise of the classroom seemed to grow farther and farther away. Xie Yu felt his hand grow warmer and warmer in He Zhao\u2019s. One of them had started sweating and the sensation was clammy.Xie Yu looked at the question he had copied wrong, remained stunned for a long time, then closed the exercise book.He Zhao didn\u2019t do much better. The game interface was on his phone screen but his avatar died less than ten seconds after the game began, and then he stayed on the game over screen and didn\u2019t do anything.Shen Jie was in a team with He Zhao. Seeing that He Zhao had been killed, he sent a few private messages. Zhao-ge, why are you playing so badly today? Leaving me to face this dangerous world alone? Ah? You\u2019re too cruel.Never had ten minutes felt this arduous. But when the dismissal bell rang, He Zhao felt that the ten minutes had been a really goddamn short time.He Zhao studied his palm for a long time and when he looked up again, his deskmate had already reached the classroom\u2019s rear door using the wall as support. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201dXie Yu said, \u201cBathroom.\u201dThe moment He Zhao said \u201cI\u2019ll\u201d\u2014the words \u2018go with you\u2019 hadn\u2019t even left his mouth\u2014Xie Yu cut him off. \u201cNo need.\u201dAs chilly as usual.He Zhao sat with one leg on his seat and asked, \u201cWill you have problems peeing?\u201dXie Yu answered, \u201cWhy, you want to hold it for me?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dNeither of them were in the habit of thinking very much before they spoke and only after the words had been said did they think them a little strange.Who knew what He Zhao was thinking of\u2014suddenly, his throat felt dry. He opened his mouth but it was a long time before he said, \u201cThen\u2026 then you go.\u201dA moment later, He Zhao exited the game and opened QQ. He considered the long string of \u2018Aaaaa\u2019 on his mood message for a long time, tapped it to edit it, and then added a few more \u2018a\u2019s at the end.He posted it.After posting the mood message, He Zhao went back to his friends list. He found a little red dot on the messages tab, tapped on it, and a notification popped up.\u2014\u2014\u201cYour Grandpa Jun\u201d sent you a friend request.He Zhao\u2019s finger stilled on the screen.After going to the bathroom, Xie Yu went to the cafeteria to eat. His foot wasn\u2019t so badly injured he couldn\u2019t walk, he just moved a little slowly. In the short run, he didn\u2019t want to see He Zhao\u2019s face. It annoyed him. He couldn\u2019t say exactly how it annoyed him, but it annoyed him so much he wanted to beat somebody up.Fearing for He Zhao\u2019s life, Xie Yu went downstairs.When he returned, He Zhao\u2019s seat was empty.\u201cZhao-ge got a call and left.\u201d Wan Da came back early, a cup of Fudan milk tea in his hands. Seeing Xie Yu glance twice more at He Zhao\u2019s empty seat, he explained, \u201cHe said he left a note for you.\u201dXie Yu glanced over the desk twice. There really was a note stuck under one corner of a textbook.Wan Da heard their Class 2.3\u2019s Big Bro Xie Yu say, \u201cNone of my business,\u201d then pull out the note and stare at it for a long time.\u201cWhat does it say?\u201d Wan Da went over and asked.Xie Yu put down the note and thought, A goddamn note like this, you might as well not have left anything.Seeing that Wan Da was genuinely curious, Xie Yu folded up the note and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know. Couldn\u2019t read it.\u201dWan Da: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dXie Yu couldn\u2019t hold himself back and added, \u201cWhat the hell.\u201dYour Grandpa Jun was Lei Jun\u2019s online handle, a username he had used to make waves all over the internet. In so many years, he hadn\u2019t changed it.At that time, when Erlei had withdrawn from school, Lei Jun had blocked him on all social media, and then they didn\u2019t talk for three years.After adding him as a friend, Lei Jun sent a text. What\u2019s your phone number?Then came a phone call.\u201cI\u2019ll wait at your school\u2019s back gate. The very broken-down one.\u201d Lei Jun was probably smoking. He was breathing hard and his voice was rough. \u201cCome out.\u201dErzhong had two back gates. One was locked year-round, in a desolate location, and had started to rust.Since he said \u2018very broken-down,\u2019 this should be the place.Lei Jun had come alone.He squatted at the back gate. Seeing He Zhao come over, he pressed his cigarette into the ground and twisted it twice, extinguishing it.He Zhao walked closer and asked, \u201cWhy here?\u201dHe couldn\u2019t get out and Lei Jun couldn\u2019t get in. It wasn\u2019t conducive to a fight.Lei Jun was still squatting on the ground. His eyes were slightly bloodshot as he looked through the metal gate at He Zhao. He said, \u201cI\u2019m not looking for a fight. I\u2019ll ask you two questions and I\u2019ll go.\u201dThen Lei Jun asked the first question. \u201cWhy did you come to Erzhong?\u201dHe Zhao felt it hard to move, and didn\u2019t say anything for a long time.Lei Jun looked down and ran his hand through his hair, then pressed the cigarette butt into the floor again. He asked, \u201cYou\u2019re\u2026 a second year in high school?\u201dHe Zhao didn\u2019t stay silent any more, and made an \u201cMm\u201d of assent.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He pulled out a carton of cigarettes from his pocket, took out a stick, lit it, then cursed, \u201cFuck.\u201dLei Jun squatted and smoked the cigarette. After a while, he stood up and said, \u201cWhat is this? To feel better about yourself? Don\u2019t goddamn bother doing useless things\u2026 No use. I can\u2019t let this go and I\u2019m not letting this go. Don\u2019t show your face in front of me again. Go around if you have to. I\u2019m worried I won\u2019t be able to stop myself from getting someone to beat you until you\u2019re crippled.\u201dHe Zhao wanted to say it wasn\u2019t like that, but the words only made several rounds in his head and he couldn\u2019t spit them out.Lei Jun didn\u2019t intend to keep talking, either. When he was done, he dusted his pants off and left.He Zhao didn\u2019t go straight back to the classroom. He went up to the sixth floor\u2014the door to the rooftop was locked, but it was easily opened with a pin. Who knew what kind of locksmith had come up with this.He pushed open the door and walked out. The wind on the roof was strong and blew his hair into a mess, and also brought him to his senses.People would occasionally go up on the roof and in the corner were piled several crushed beer cans as evidence. A gust of wind rose, and the cans made a racket as they rolled around.He Zhao lay on the roof, eyes fixed unblinkingly above him. He seemed to be seeing himself from the third year of junior high, and the strong, determined Fang Xiaolei, too.\u201cNobody\u2019s in the chem lab at this time, for sure.\u201d\u201cZhao-ge, didn\u2019t the teacher say this experiment was very dangerous? If we slip in like that\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve memorized all the steps from the video. It\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\u201cWhere did you get the key?\u201d\u201cStole it.\u201dMany sounds circled by his ear, dragging him down into a bottomless depth.Thick black smoke, choking him and making it hard to breathe.The fire truck siren.The frightened tone of the security guard who had placed the phone call.And lastly, the stern voice of the woman interrogating them. \u201cWho allowed you to go in and do experiments on your own? Miss Liu was in the adjoining office and we almost couldn\u2019t save her. Who\u2019ll take responsibility?!\u201dThe matter blew up: a student had stolen the lab key and done chemistry experiments on their own. An accident had happened and someone had nearly died.De Yu Middle School kept a tight watch on their chemistry lab and there was a small adjoining room that served as an office for the teacher on duty. Miss Liu had happened to be on duty that day, and who would have thought that she was still there after hours. She had worked too hard and fallen asleep at her desk.If not for the security guard who had told them he hadn\u2019t seen Miss Liu leave through the school gates, they might not have even known someone was still there.\u201cWhat on earth happened? Fang Xiaolei, if you won\u2019t explain, then He Zhao, you explain.\u201d\u201cI stole the key.\u201d He Zhao heard his own voice. Even though this matter had also thrown him off balance, he still admitted the truth. \u201cI did the experiment. I made him go along with me and it has nothing to do with him.\u201dThe woman sat in her seat, a red pen in her hand. Her thumb pushed at the pen cap and after a long time, she calmed down enough to pinch her forehead and say, \u201cI understand. You two go back to class first\u2026 don\u2019t tell anyone about this. No matter who asks, don\u2019t say anything.\u201dEven while walking out of the office, Fang Xiaolei was trembling from fear.\u201cTeach said she\u2019d think of a way.\u201d He Zhao patted Erlei\u2019s head and said, \u201cThis has nothing to do with you. If someone\u2019s getting punished, it\u2019ll be me.\u201dAt the time, He Zhao hadn\u2019t been aware of what the homeroom teacher was thinking. Her \u2018way out\u2019 was to get rid of the bad student and keep the good one\u2014Fang Xiaolei was ordered to withdraw from school.With Fang Xiaolei\u2019s grades, he would never make it to high school. Instead of dragging down the graduation rate, they might as well conveniently get rid of him.The high school exams were approaching. By the time he found out, nothing could be done.He Zhao couldn\u2019t get in touch with Erlei; they said he had gone back to his hometown. The teacher had banked on the thought that Erlei\u2019s family had no hopes for their child and would be happier if he learned a trade and started making money early.The school\u2019s stance on the matter was the same as the homeroom teacher\u2019s. To send a withdrawal notice and then rescind it would be to slap themselves in the face.He Zhao, the one who should have withdrawn from school, was told by everyone to stay. And the one who shouldn\u2019t have withdrawn from school had left instead.\u201cHe Zhao, here is a mock exam paper. Do it, then bring it over and I\u2019ll correct it for you,\u201d the woman said with a smile. \u201cThe high school exams are coming up. Just focus on studying.\u201dAt this point, He Zhao felt nauseated. He pulled himself into a sitting position, a sorry figure, and dragged his hands over his face.Not long before this, Fang Xiaolei had often come over to ask him about study questions. He had a book in his hand all day, which had left Lei Jun stunned.Fang Xiaolei said, \u201cI want to study hard. I can\u2019t keep playing like this.\u201dLei Jun patted his head. \u201cHeyo, Erlei, you\u2019re doing well. Which school will you apply to?\u201d\u201cHeh heh\u2026 I want to get into Erzhong.\u201d\u201cBecause the grade cutoff is lowest?\u201dTo assuage my guilt? He Zhao asked himself.He had given up on the high school exams and dropped out for a year. Then he had come to Erzhong and placed last in every exam\u2026 was it for this?It seemed not.These things were ridiculous and so many \u2018why\u2019s loomed over him. He wasn\u2019t sure what answers he was searching for, either.He Zhao didn\u2019t return to the classroom until evening self-study let out.When the dismissal bell rang, Wan Da and the others cheered, then went downstairs in twos and threes with their backpacks. \u201cCome to my room tonight to watch a movie? I downloaded it at home. Sci-fi action movie. I heard it\u2019s wicked cool and awesome\u2026\u201dHalfway through, Wan Da turned and asked, \u201cYu-ge, coming?\u201dXie Yu said, \u201cNot coming.\u201d Forget the movie, he still had two mock exam papers to do.After showering, Xie Yu picked out several midterm exams from A City\u2019s premier high school. He planned to do them ahead of schedule\u2014although there was a lot of content not yet covered in class, he had quietly read ahead in his textbook during class time and had more or less mastered the content.Questions of this difficulty shouldn\u2019t pose a problem.Xie Yu held the pen in his hand but couldn\u2019t focus while doing the questions.He Zhao had been about to turn off his phone when he received the text from Xie Yu.The \u2018short message\u2019\u00b9 really was short. Three words. Where are you?He Zhao was about to pretend he hadn\u2019t seen it, but when he touched the screen his fingers seemed to have a mind of their own. He replied with two words: Internet caf\u00e9.Explosion Bar?There were several internet caf\u00e9s near school and Explosion Bar was the most well-known of these. It protected its customers well: when teachers came by the caf\u00e9 for inspection, they\u2019d send emergency messages to their customers.All the employees at the caf\u00e9 were acquainted with the teachers who came to check the most, especially Dean Jiang. The moment they encountered Mad Dog, they sent out the highest-level emergency alert.Their mission was to give high school students a safe and reliable online environment.Xie Yu rarely went to these underground internet caf\u00e9s. He didn\u2019t like the stuffy, dark atmosphere, or the delinquent youth that sat there, cigarettes in their mouths, long bangs hiding melancholy eyes.When Xie Yu climbed the wall to leave, he suddenly couldn\u2019t understand himself\u2026 or what on earth he was doing.Night had fully fallen and only streetlights lit the road. Trees rustled in the wind.A cold breeze slipped under the hem of his shirt. Xie Yu was about to jump down from the wall when he heard a nearby voice say, \u201cYou really don\u2019t want your legs any more, do you? You\u2019re quite resilient. You even climbed the wall with your leg like that.\u201dHe Zhao walked over from the opposite side of the road. It was dark and Xie Yu couldn\u2019t make out his expression. He slowly walked over to stand at the base of the wall and said, \u201cWhat are you coming out for?\u201dXie Yu said, \u201cMMOs.\u201dWith Xie Yu\u2019s usual performance, this reason was entirely plausible. The second-to-last in the year, suffering from insomnia, slipping out of school to hang out at an internet caf\u00e9. Very normal.He Zhao didn\u2019t let him jump down directly and prepared to catch him at the bottom.\u201cCripple,\u201d He Zhao said, opening his arms and looking up at Xie Yu. \u201cJump.\u201dXie Yu said, \u201cYou\u2019re the goddamn cripple.\u201dExplosion Bar was located opposite the Gold List restaurant. The entrance was beside a clothing store, up a flight of stairs, on the second floor.A certain delinquent surnamed He had earphones hanging around his neck, fingers tapping away at the keyboard. Others had cigarettes in their mouths\u2014he had a lollipop.He still wore his school uniform; he hadn\u2019t changed.It was late at night and there were many people in Explosion Bar. Several looked familiar and Xie Yu thought for a long time before remembering that he had met them in the last exam group at the monthly exams.He Zhao wasn\u2019t sure what games he wanted to play, either. He clicked on an icon that caught his eye and was half-heartedly playing it when a hand came into view, index finger crooked, and tapped on the table in front of him.He Zhao glanced over and saw his little friend in a white vest, hair still damp. \u201cYou come here and stay overnight often?\u201d\u201cNot that often,\u201d He Zhao said. \u201cA few times\u2026 a month.\u201dXie Yu nodded, thinking he had gained another insight into the world of a bad student. He had never thought about this aspect of it before. Then he looked down and tapped a line into his notes app: Spend the night at an internet caf\u00e9, twice a month.The two found teams and went a few rounds in the game. By the end, Xie Yu was so tired he lay down at his seat and slept.He Zhao took off his headphones and didn\u2019t keep playing. He turned and watched his deskmate for a long time.The lighting in the internet caf\u00e9 was bad, and fell on Xie Yu\u2019s face alongside the glow of the monitor.He Zhao stared at him for a while, unable to avert his eyes, and crunched the lollipop in his mouth to pieces.The next day, He Zhao and Xie Yu both wore dark circles to class.\u201cWhat happened to the two of you?\u201d Wan Da tsked in wonder. \u201cWhat were you doing last night? Or did our study rep drive you so hard you have dark circles under your eyes?\u201dXue Xisheng had not given up. Post-it notes of all kinds with various formulas and vocabulary words written on them would often appear on He Zhao and Xie Yu\u2019s desks, alongside some quotes that could have come out of Chicken Soup for the Soul. If you don\u2019t work hard when you\u2019re young, you\u2019ll regret it when you\u2019re old\u2026 Lifelong learning. Go for it! You\u2019re just a step away from success.If Xue Xisheng had come from a well-off family, he might even have bought supplementary study materials for them.He Zhao lay down at his desk the moment he sat down. \u201cNo. Stayed up all night at an internet caf\u00e9.\u201dWan Da asked, \u201cYu-ge, too? Why didn\u2019t you both come watch the movie with us yesterday?\u201d\u201cWhat movie.\u201d He Zhao had a headache from staying up all night and who knew what he was thinking. \u201cMy deskmate isn\u2019t that kind of person. Don\u2019t lead him astray.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

During evening self-study last night, Wan Da had passed it around the class, and all the live-in students had indicated that they couldn\u2019t decipher anything. After a round of guessing, not only could they not tell how many words there actually were on the note, some even thought they were bone script.\u00b9Compared to this, He Zhao\u2019s exam handwriting could be considered meticulous. At least it was only ugly, it couldn\u2019t be mistaken for bone script.Xie Yu saw it and suddenly remembered, then tossed the wad at He Zhao. \u201cWhat the hell did you write on this?\u201dHe Zhao smoothed out the note and glanced at it. \u201cNot coming back to evening self-study,\u201d he read out, then added, \u201cYou couldn\u2019t read it?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Xie Yu really wanted to shove the paper in his face.He Zhao admired the note a little longer. \u201cHow come you couldn\u2019t read it? I wrote it very attentively. Look at these words\u2026\u201dXie Yu was terrified He Zhao would start up with an expansive analyses of his artistic aptitude again and said, \u201cAll right, shut up.\u201dAside from mustering up a little energy when talking to Xie Yu, He Zhao either slept or was on his phone all morning. Old Tang made him go up to answer a question and all he said was, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s up with Zhao-ge today?\u201d Liu Cunhao and the others all looked forward to hearing He Zhao answer questions: he always came up with unexpected surprises. Class was boring, after all. \u201cSomething\u2019s not right.\u201dWan Da glanced backward and saw the back of He Zhao\u2019s head. \u201cProbably tired from the all-nighter.\u201dHe Zhao was bent at the waist, his forehead on the edge of the desk.He held his phone in his hand, between his legs, and tapped into the chat window. I went to look for Erlei.Then he deleted it character by character and looked at the words Your Grandpa Jun in a daze.Lei Jun had gotten one thing right: no matter what he did, it was no use now.It had already happened. Because of him. Nothing he could say would change anything.After Erlei withdrew from school, he hadn\u2019t kept in contact with anybody.He was definitely angry, He Zhao thought. If it were him, he wouldn\u2019t be able to bear it, either.He had asked many people, including everyone in the area Erlei used to live, and had eventually arrived at his hometown.He still remembered every word and every sound from Erlei\u2019s mouth.\u201cZhao-ge, this isn\u2019t entirely your fault. But I can\u2019t help resenting you.\u201d\u201cBut I don\u2019t want you to do this, either. You\u2026 you\u2019d better go back and study. Can\u2019t just skip class like this.\u201d\u201cMe? I\u2019m not studying any more, and I\u2019m not going to look for a new school\u2026 My family found a training course for me. I\u2019ll start working and earn money.\u201dHe Zhao threw his phone into his desk and shut his eyes.During the midday break, Luo Wenqiang and Liu Cunhao carried a cardboard box through the door. It was three blocks from the faculty office to the classroom, and class rep Liu Cunhao didn\u2019t exercise much so, by the time he reached the doorway, he was almost done for. His breath came shallowly as he said, \u201cClassmates, the prizes have arrived\u2026 the prizes from the sports meet. Make way, make way.\u201dErzhong was efficient. The sports meet had only just ended and the prizes had already arrived.\u201cWhat prizes?\u201d Some people crowded around curiously to see.\u201cDean Jiang personally picked out the sports meet prizes. Very unique. You definitely\u2026\u201d Liu Cunhao paused, then continued, \u201cWon\u2019t like it.\u201dLiu Cunhao cut the box open with a knife, revealing a neat stack of supplementary class material. From After-Class English Reading to Entering the Wonderful World of Physics, every subject was represented.\u201cCome on and pick what you want. Feel free,\u201d Liu Cunhao said. \u201cFirst place gets dibs. Who\u2019s first?\u201dThe athletes who had participated: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dLiu Cunhao said, \u201cZhao-ge, stop sleeping. You\u2019re our push-ups champion. Come over and pick?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t want to.\u201d He Zhao didn\u2019t even look up, his voice muffled. \u201cWhoever wants it can have it.\u201dThen Liu Cunhao asked, \u201cYu-ge?\u201dXie Yu said, \u201cPretend I didn\u2019t participate.\u201dCertainly worthy of last place and second-to-last place, respectively. They\u2019d rather die than read textbooks and do practice questions.Eventually, Xu Qingqing picked two classic novels, Luo Wenqiang picked a book of physics practice questions, and the other athletes were very put on the spot. Only Xue Xisheng looked on with envy and said, \u201cGym rep, next sports meet let me join in too. Any event is fine.\u201dAs the class was in an uproar, Wu Zheng walked in with a stack of mock exam papers under his arm.\u201cDon\u2019t think that school has only just started! Count on your fingers! There isn\u2019t much time left!\u201d Old Wu put the practice questions down and pulled out half a stick of chalk from the box. As he spoke, the chalk landed with perfect accuracy on the head of a certain student in the last row. \u201cMidterm exams are coming up! Let me see what grades you can come up with.\u201dHe Zhao didn\u2019t react to the blow. His fingers twitched, he shifted his position, and he kept sleeping.Xie Yu saw that Old Wu was giving out test papers and kicked He Zhao. \u201cPop quiz.\u201dIn-class test\u2014a more advanced form of the monthly exams as well as a preview of the upcoming mid-term exams.They didn\u2019t have to split their desks for the pop quiz that lasted two class periods.With several minutes to go, before handing out the papers, Wu Zheng said, \u201cIf you need to go to the toilet, go now. Don\u2019t complain about needing to go later. I won\u2019t care. You can hold it.\u201dThe students filtered out to the toilet in groups, their spirits low. \u201cPop quiz? Why another test? Endless tests.\u201dIn the few minutes before the test started, Xue Xisheng came over and fervently explained the important content to them, making use of every second. He was talking so much He Zhao couldn\u2019t sleep at all.Xue Xisheng pushed up his glasses as he spoke, expression completely serious. \u201cDo you remember now? This question will definitely come up. Just use the formula I gave you just now. Recite it back to me. These few points are very easy to get. If you get it right then our class average will go up by half a point.\u201dHe Zhao: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dXie Yu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThis nap would not happen.He Zhao went to the bathroom and washed his face, preparing to face the test on his return. When the papers were handed out, he discovered that he couldn\u2019t find the black gel pen he had used to write the note yesterday.After hunting for a while, he gave up and asked his deskmate for one to borrow. \u201cOld Xie, do you have an extra pen?\u201dSince discovering that bad students had a habit of not bringing writing implements, Xie Yu wanted to try it out once to show off his professional skill. Now, during this pop quiz, he got his chance. He said, \u201cI don\u2019t have a pen either.\u201dThe \u201cso poor their house is empty\u201d deskmates, who couldn\u2019t produce a pen no matter how they searched, stared at each other for a while. Then He Zhao tapped the shoulder of the student in front of him. \u201cFriend, can we borrow two pens?\u201dThe student in front hunted through his pencil case. \u201cI, I only have one.\u201d He had a lot of mechanical pencil lead refills, but only one extra writing utensil.He Zhao thought about it, then said, \u201cOne is fine. That\u2019s enough. Thanks.\u201dXie Yu asked, \u201cOne is enough?\u201d\u201cYou use it first.\u201d He Zhao handed the pen to him. \u201cI haven\u2019t found a question I can answer yet, so I don\u2019t need it for now.\u201dXie Yu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dXie Yu blindly answered a few questions, thinking about He Zhao\u2019s level and how he would need to answer the mid-term questions in order to knock this idiot off last place.Xie Yu adjusted his own score according to He Zhao\u2019s answers and had no idea that his last-place deskmate had also been observing him.After completing the paper, Xie Yu estimated that he would score about the same as He Zhao on this math test.After finishing the paper, He Zhao put it under his textbook, then lay on the desk and stealthily watched Xie Yu.Xie Yu had no idea why He Zhao was staring at him. \u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201dPerhaps he was exhausted from last night\u2019s all nighter, but he did look a little tired. After a pause, he said, \u201cBad mood.\u201dIt\u2019s a little better when I look at you.If possible\u2026 I want to hug you too.As He Zhao continued thinking, he suddenly very much wanted to ask the cripple next to him, Do you want to climb the wall and go to the internet cafe again tonight?He Zhao had the faint impression that his thoughts toward his little friend were going in the wrong direction, and he jumped from shock at the thought \u2018I want to hug you.\u2019The dismissal bell rang and Wu Zheng called out from the podium, \u201cTurn in your tests. Stop writing. Stop looking back and forth! \u2026Too bad if you didn\u2019t finish! Turn your papers in!\u201d\u201cBig bro flirt, your paper.\u201dXie Yu was checking his score again and held out his hand for He Zhao\u2019s paper without looking up, but He Zhao still hadn\u2019t done anything after a while. He looked up and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dHe Zhao had already left through the rear door and proceeded to skip the next two class periods at that.But Shen Jie, attending class as usual, got a text from his Zhao-ge, an inexplicable six words. Have you ever been in love?Shen Jie thought hard for a while and really couldn\u2019t discern the intent of the question. He replied, Does a crush count?Then his Zhao-ge went radio silent.Shen Jie still didn\u2019t understand. He scratched his head. He didn\u2019t understand the world his big bro lived in.He Zhao went back to the dormitory, intending to catch up on sleep, but he couldn\u2019t fall asleep no matter how hard he tried. He endured till school let out, then couldn\u2019t take it any more, got up, and went back to the classroom for evening self-study. From afar, he saw Wan Da leaning out of the window, peering left and right, looking terribly suspicious.He Zhao walked over and stopped in front of the window. He crooked a finger and tapped at the brick beneath the window. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cBeware fire, beware thieves, beware Mad Dog,\u201d Wan Da said. \u201cQing-jie and the others are playing Dou Dizhu and told me to keep watch.\u201dHe Zhao looked in through the window and saw his little friend, toward whom he was starting to have very strange thoughts, also in the Dou Dizhu lineup.Wan Da summarized the battle situation. \u201cYu-ge is like the God of Gambling incarnate. He won every round. 30 thousand bucks right now. Qing-jie is about to cry.\u201dHe said Dou Dizhu, but the cards were all made from A4 paper with some ugly red and black pips drawn on them. A thin stack was clutched in their hands, and it was difficult even to draw cards.It looked like a last-minute decision\u2014someone had come up with the idea of a round of Dou Dizhu so they had started playing. After Class 3 had gotten to know each other, they got up to all sorts of mischief.Xie Yu had the situation in hand.He had indeed won 30 thousand. On a sheet of paper, in black gel ink was a 3 followed by four zeroes.He Zhao stood in the corridor, leaning against the windowsill, and watched with interest for a while.One of the players, Xu Qingqing, felt that she couldn\u2019t keep playing. There was no fun at all in playing cards with Xie Yu, only bitterness. She really wanted to go back in time half an hour and strangle Wan Da to death before he could ask, \u201cYu-ge, in for this game?\u201dShe looked at the cards left in her hand, then left and right. Seeing He Zhao outside the window, her eyes lit up and she said, \u201cZhao-ge, come and take your deskmate away!\u201dXie Yu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter the previous experience, the word \u2018take\u2019\u00b2 seemed to have become a sensitive topic. He couldn\u2019t quite describe the feeling.He Zhao didn\u2019t even have time to react.\u201cYour deskmate is a walking Dou Dizhu hack,\u201d Xu Qingqing said. \u201cThis is a terrible gaming experience.\u201dXie Yu put down the cards and tried to salvage his own dignity before leaving. \u201cYou play too badly.\u201dXu Qingqing wanted to send away this Buddha,\u00b3 so she admitted to her bad card skills. \u201cYes, we suck.\u201dHe Zhao said, \u201cThen you\u2019re missing one player now.\u201d\u201cMe,\u201d Wan Da raised a hand and said. \u201cI want to play, too.\u201dXu Qingqing was worried she\u2019d just sent one menace away to have another take his place, so she asked carefully, \u201cHow are your card skills?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m terrible. Played since I was little and never won money,\u201d Wan Da said. \u201cWhen I play Dou Dizhu I only play on the low-level end. I don\u2019t even dare think of playing with someone with skills like Yu-ge.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As cold as always.Wan Da watched as Xie Yu, after saying all that, still proceeded to get up and sit down next to the window facing the corridor. He couldn\u2019t tell what on earth this cold big bro really intended.Was he willing to keep watch or unwilling?He Zhao smiled and said, \u201cYou all keep playing. He\u2019s on the lookout.\u201dWan Da was genuinely shocked. He said, not quite believing it, \u201cHow do you know? How can you tell?\u201dXie Yu was a loner, prideful, very antisocial, and had a hair-trigger temper.The words, \u2018Don\u2019t bother me,\u2019 were just about written on his face.Last year when their class year had been split into the East and West Buildings, the Big Bro of the West Building had been Xie Yu. Just the rumor of his black nail polish had scared away countless people. He sounded like a dark, twisted character.He Zhao didn\u2019t answer Wan Da\u2019s question.He jumped in through the window, feet landing on a chair, and thought, I just know.Xie Yu was still on his phone. From time to time, he\u2019d glance up and outside then look back down after finding nothing out of the ordinary.He Zhao sat down at the desk in front of Xie Yu, his back to the blackboard as he watched the group play Dou Dizhu. Then he glanced up at the latest homeroom assignment Class 3 had been given: My dreams.Class 3\u2019s homeroom reports were especially terrible. In the whole class of 30-odd people, no one had any talent for drawing. Since they wouldn\u2019t win any contests, they might as well not waste their effort on it.But they were very creative. Every student wrote a wish on their paper and stuck it to the board with tape in the shape of a rather untidy heart.It was just something they had put together on the fly, but Tang Sen took many photographs of it as if it were a great treasure.He Zhao glanced back at the person in front of him.The Big Bro of the West wore his school uniform\u2014the weather had grown cooler lately\u2014and, perhaps because he didn\u2019t like the cold, had put on a jacket on top of his uniform. His hands were partly hidden in his sleeves, half his fingers peeking out as he concentrated on tapping at his phone screen.Xie Yu\u2019s movements were occasionally very gentle. For instance, when he woke up during morning self-study and blearily opened his eyes. Or when he said, \u2018none of my business,\u2019 then, after a pause, added a question mark at the end.Or now, with his slender and pale fingers curled, his pinky lightly hooked on the edge of his sleeve.He Zhao rapped on the desk. \u201cLittle friend, what dreams did you write about?\u201dXie Yu\u2019s fingers stilled on the phone screen. He had been chatting with Aunt Mei\u2014asking how business was going at Guang Mao and telling her not to scrimp and save. If she didn\u2019t have enough help, she should hire several more people. The sudden change of topic surprised him. \u201cAh?\u201dThen he followed He Zhao\u2019s gaze and turned around to look at the homeroom assignment on the blackboard.He had scribbled down whatever came to mind. What dreams? To genuinely lay them out in this \u2018heart of love\u2019 for the whole world to see would have been too dramatic, would it not? Besides, a second-year high school student\u2019s entire world consisted only of \u2018the high school exams.\u2019 Wan Da and the others had only laughed when they collected their papers to fill in and didn\u2019t take it seriously. \u201cDreams! Fudan is my dream!\u201d\u201cYou can forget about Fudan. But you can have Fudan milk tea,\u201d Liu Cunhao mocked him, then narrated a daydream of his own. \u201cMe, I want to save the world.\u201dWan Da patted the class rep\u2019s head. \u201cYou\u2019d better come drink Fudan milk tea with me and stop thinking about nonsense.\u201dIn adolescence, no one really had a clear or solid self-image, and things like dreams still seemed far away.He Zhao was still asking about it.Xie Yu had already forgotten what he had written down. He thought about it a little more closely and remembered. \u201cStrike it rich.\u201dHe Zhao had thought that his \u2018world peace\u2019 had been perfunctory enough, but now he realized the guy in front of him was a genius. \u201cStrike it rich?\u201dXie Yu said, \u201c\u2026You disapprove?\u201d\u201cNope. This is a good dream,\u201d He Zhao said, then remembered that Xie Yu had taken a biographical photo of him that he hadn\u2019t collected yet. So he knocked on the desk again and asked, \u201cWhere\u2019s my suave photo?\u201d\u201cHow annoying can you get? What suave photo?\u201d\u201cI posed so hard. Didn\u2019t you get a photo?\u201dPosed.At the mention of this word, Xie Yu felt transported back to that very awkward event that was so embarrassing he couldn\u2019t bear to look. \u201cYou have the gall to mention that?\u201d\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I?\u201d He Zhao said. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t resist taking photos of me, right?\u201dXie Yu thought, \u2018Couldn\u2019t resist, my ass.\u2019Really shameless.Xie Yu had uploaded the photo on his feed. Since He Zhao really wanted to see it, Xie Yu found it and showed it to him.He Zhao glanced at it and found that it was quite a passable photo. \u201cGood photography skills. Of course, the important thing is that I\u2019m photogenic\u2026\u201d As He Zhao spoke, he accidentally scrolled down to the comments beneath the photo. He discovered that, although Xie Yu was a loner who didn\u2019t draw attention to himself, there were more than fifty comments on the photo.Looking at the names, they were all Aunt somebody or So-and-so\u2019s Mom, all old ladies of some sort, and one of them even had the note, \u2018Breakfast place one street over \u2013 Wang\u2019s Mom.\u2019Aunt Mei: Son, who\u2019s this in the middle? Quite handsome.xy replied to Aunt Mei: An idiot.Dalei: Damn, why does this guy seem so familiar?!xy replied to Dalei: Crowd-face.\u00b9\u2026\u2026He Zhao read through all of them and found that his little friend was quite happy to diss him. \u201cNever mind the crowd-face bit, you told your mom I\u2019m an idiot?\u201dXie Yu had clearly forgotten about the comments section. He said calmly, \u201cThat\u2019s my godmother.\u201dXie Yu rarely talked about his family and now he produced a godmother out of nowhere. These fifty-plus comments indicated that his little friend\u2019s social network was quite impressive. He Zhao continued asking, \u201cYou have a godmother?\u201dXie Yu introduced her briefly. \u201cMy godmother. Ground snake. \u00b2 Met her on the streets.\u201dHe Zhao pointed at the name Dalei. \u201cAnd this one?\u201dXie Yu said, \u201cYou met him in the police station.\u201dEventually, Xie Yu grew very frustrated\u2014he had no idea how to explain his relationship with the breakfast store aunt one street over\u2014and papered it over with the comment, \u201cYou\u2019re suave, you\u2019re not a crowd-face,\u201d and declared the matter finished.Before He Zhao returned the phone to Xie Yu, he swiftly entered his own phone number. \u201cYou don\u2019t even go on QQ. Add me as a friend?\u201dXie Yu said, \u201cYou\u2019ve already added yourself. Why bother asking me?\u201dHe Zhao replied, \u201cTo be polite.\u201dAunt Mei and the others used text messages, so Xie Yu and Dalei had followed suit and gotten used to it.Xie Yu didn\u2019t really need to contact his classmates, anyway. In first year, he was the sort who lost all contact with his previous friends after leaving middle school, and after a year of not being in touch, he didn\u2019t even get notifications from his teachers any more.But now, it seemed that\u2026 something had changed.For instance, his contacts list where the \u2018Friends\u2019 group had steadily grown.For instance, Xie Yu had never imagined that one day he would sit at the window, keeping watch for his classmates so that they could play Dou Dizhu in peace.Damn it, has my temper gotten better? Xie Yu thought.Wan Da\u2019s self-assessment had not been exaggerated in the least. He didn\u2019t only have bad luck on the draw, he also had terrible skills.\u201cI admire rookies like you.\u201d Before long, Xu Qingqing had won all her money back and said contentedly, \u201cOur friendship will last a lifetime.\u201dWan Da didn\u2019t much care how badly he had lost, either. He replied, \u201cMy honor, Miss Xu.\u201dHe Zhao sat on the desk and leaned against the windowsill, helping keep watch for a while. \u201cHow much longer?\u201d\u201cZhao-ge, last round, almost done.\u201d Wan Da was very excited. He glanced at his terrible hand of cards. \u201cI\u2019m about to lose.\u201dHe Zhao tsked. \u201cYou still sound happy?\u201dXie Yu said, \u201cLosing every single hand is a talent, too.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201d Wan Da nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly it. I think I\u2019m pretty talented.\u201dThey had kept watch for a long time but Mad Dog hadn\u2019t appeared. However, Shen Jie, who had been held back at dismissal to talk to his teacher, stopped and glanced in as he passed Class 3 on his way out of the faculty office. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dShen Jie stood at the window and looked in. Hearing Xu Qingqing call out heartily, \u201cFour with three,\u201d he was shocked at Class 3\u2019s talent. \u201cDamn it, a card room?\u201d\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d He Zhao retorted. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you gone home?\u201dShen Jie said, \u201cThis afternoon was the math pop quiz, right? I\u2026 had a little accident.\u201dWan Da had no playable cards left and was easily distracted. \u201cI know. He got caught cheating during this afternoon\u2019s test.\u201dShen Jie had intended to gloss over the matter but Wan Da had directly revealed everything and he could only helplessly say, \u201cHow do you know everything?\u201dWan Da said shamelessly, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I don\u2019t know in my part of the world.\u201d\u201cJust fold. You just listen at corners and you think you\u2019re something,\u201d Shen Jie said before he left. \u201cRight, Zhao-ge. What you said this afternoon, about being in lo\u2026\u201dShen Jie still hadn\u2019t let go of the \u2018being in love\u2019 text He Zhao had sent. The more he thought about it the more he felt something wasn\u2019t right, so now that he\u2019d bumped into He Zhao he wanted to clear the air. But before the word \u2018love\u2019 could leave his mouth, he saw his Zhao-ge go rigid. He seemed to have hit a sore spot. He Zhao nearly jumped out of the window but settled for leaning his upper body out. \u201cShut up, you.\u201d\u201cNo, I just meant to ask you.\u201d Shen Jie couldn\u2019t figure it out. \u201cThat being in\u2026\u201dXie Yu tilted his head. He had no idea what these two were doing. \u201cTalking about what?\u201d\u00b3He Zhao jumped out of the window, looking extremely anxious, the length of his entire back taut. The moment he landed, he covered Shen Jie\u2019s mouth and followed up. \u201cWe need to talk. You\u2019re looking for me because we need to talk, yes?\u201dShen Jie was about to say, \u201cOf course not, it\u2019s about being in love,\u201d but all he could make were muffled sounds of, \u201cMm, mm.\u201dHe kept \u201cMm\u201d-ing as He Zhao dragged him away.Xie Yu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat are the two of them up to?\u201d Wan Da\u2019s hot air immediately rushed out as he deflated. \u201cSomething\u2019s up.\u201dXu Qingqing said, \u201cKnows-It-All-In-This-World, you\u2019d better concentrate on losing this hand.\u201dHe Zhao wasn\u2019t sure where he was dragging Shen Jie to, either. Nowhere seemed like a good place to talk about this, so he dragged him straight back to the dorms.Shen Jie sat on the chair, gasping for breath. On the way over, He Zhao hadn\u2019t only covered his mouth, but his nostrils, too. \u201cZhao-ge, I almost suffocated and died, do you know?\u201dBefore he had recovered, He Zhao said, \u201cThat\u2026 a crush is fine, too. Tell me about it?\u201dShen Jie said, \u201cAh? What\u2019s there to say about a crush? Feels uncomfortable and bloated, like a can of Fanta that\u2019s been shaken very hard. Bubbling up\u2014if anyone were to open the can, it would explode in his face.\u201dHe Zhao: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThis metaphor was very apt.But He Zhao felt that his own can of soda was quite intense. It didn\u2019t need anyone to open it, it would explode on its own.Shen Jie walked out of the boys\u2019 dormitory and to the bus stop to wait for the bus. He sneezed in the autumn wind. He still hadn\u2019t made sense of this matter with He Zhao, and now he even wanted a soda.Shen Jie kept thinking about it. On the subject of dating, he\u2019d known He Zhao for very long but hadn\u2019t seen him date anyone.He Zhao was obviously someone who could find a relationship very easily if he wanted to.Going off his looks alone, one might think He Zhao had a lot of relationship experience. As the saying went, he was so suave he was untrustworthy.But his Zhao-ge had remained single for more than ten years.Shen Jie had personally experienced it when hanging out with He Zhao. One time a girl had shyly come up to start a conversation. He Zhao had replied, \u201cAre you selling something? Sorry, not buying.\u201d\u201cWhen Heaven opens a door, it closes a window.\u201d Shen Jie shook his head. The bus was pulling into the station, and as he reached for his card, he said, \u201cLooks alone don\u2019t cut it.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even doing mock exam papers didn\u2019t help.He Zhao discovered that the strange, something-is-out-of-place feeling had gradually built up, little by little. By the time he became aware of it, it was completely out of control.Countless times he had been shaken, and each time, he wasn\u2019t sure what to do.He wasn\u2019t sure where to put his hands, he didn\u2019t dare look directly at that person, yet a voice in his heart continued to shout.He, likes, Xie Yu.Not that sort of like. That sort of like.Whenever he saw him, his heart filled up. Afraid to win, yet afraid to lose. Not grounded at all, with the lingering feeling that somewhere within him still remained empty. That sort of like.But.He Zhao had remained single for more than ten years. Faced with this age-old dilemma, his thoughts rushed about in all directions like a wild beast but still could not find their way.Eventually the beast stopped, having exhausted all its energy. He Zhao sat on the ground and thought, would his little friend\u2026 dislike it?As someone who was discussed in a CP thread on the school forums, He Zhao was, in a broad sense, aware of the matters of being gay and being straight.What if Xie Yu was as straight as an arrow?He was at an age where it was easy to be reckless, but he didn\u2019t dare to just do as he pleased.Eventually, He Zhao tossed his pen down. He wasn\u2019t sure what to do, either, so he opened Xie Yu\u2019s social media profile and scrolled down, post by post.Xie Yu\u2019s social media profile was like a boundary line, cordoning off the Xie Yu he knew. He Zhao now saw Xie Yu\u2019s life from before, his friend circle\u2026 and the gentleness that he ordinarily never showed.Xie Yu\u2019s everyday posts were very simple, generally a short phrase. When he was angry he would post, \u2018Go fucking scram,\u2019 and when he was happy he would post pictures of nature or his surroundings. One common subject of the photographs was a very fat orange cat, with the caption Eat yourself to death.The orange cat sometimes sunned itself belly-up at the entrance to the convenience store, napping with its eyes narrowed.The convenience store looked run-down and children\u2019s toys were arranged on its stock shelves. A whole wall of cheap toys.There was a signpost in the upper left corner of the photo, the words \u2018Black Water Street\u2019 faintly visible.He Zhao paused. This location sounded familiar.But the posts about Black Water Street had grown fewer in number over the last few years, and He Zhao thought to himself, Did he move?As he continued scrolling, he reached a close-up photo of the orange cat. It was very close to the camera, its nose almost pressed to the glass, and Xie Yu\u2019s hand was placed on the orange cat\u2019s head\u2014\u2014just looking at the hand, one could not imagine that the person rubbing the cat\u2019s head could be vicious at all.Xie Yu was sitting on the side of the road, and the cat was clearly very comfortable being petted, its eyes narrowed with satisfaction.He Zhao stared at the photo for a long time before quietly saving it.The Xie Yu in these photos was different from the Xie Yu in school, but he was still the little friend He Zhao knew.With such a thick layer of armor, everyone thought he was impenetrable.\u201cDamn.\u201d He Zhao couldn\u2019t bear it any longer and flipped his phone over. \u201c\u2026Why is he so cute.\u201dAfter evening self-study ended, Xie Yu returned to his dorm room and had just finished showering when he received a phone call from home. He thought it was Madam Gu calling to ask him again if he would be going home for the weekend, and prepared to use the excuse that he needed to study for the upcoming mid-term exams.But when he picked up the phone he heard Zhong Jie\u2019s voice, stuttering and clearly drunk. \u201cXie Yu, I\u2019m te-te-telling you, don\u2019t fucking think\u2026\u201dZhong Jie\u2019s voice stopped there, because Xie Yu had hung up the phone.Two minutes passed, then Zhong Jie called again and said haughtily, \u201cYou\u2019re just a peasant, but you dare hang up on me?\u201dA vein jumped at Xie Yu\u2019s temple.What the hell was \u2018peasant?\u2019 The drunk was still acting like he was a lord tyrant?He Zhao was still awash in the feeling of \u2018my little friend is too damn cute\u2019 when he heard his cute little friend walking down the corridor and cursing out loud, \u201cMotherfucker, are you quite finished?\u201dHe Zhao: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cEveryone owes you something and you\u2019re the worst off.\u201d Xie Yu pushed open his dorm room door and walked out, heading to the deserted end of the corridor to keep talking. Expression blank, he said, \u201cYes, I\u2019ve been eyeing your family fortune for a long time now. You had better guard it like the dog you are.\u201dXie Yu had not taken two steps before the door opposite his opened and He Zhao leaned in his doorway, watching him.Xie Yu did not react, passed him, and kept walking, cursing the whole way. Very impressively, he never repeated a single curse.When he was done, and walking back after hanging up the phone, He Zhao asked, \u201cWho was it that deserved that cursing?\u201dHe Zhao did not ask anything further about the situation. An average person, listening to this without knowing the full picture, would think Xie Yu was the bully here. But He Zhao straightaway labeled the other party, who had been cursed at for a long time, as \u2018deserving of cursing.\u2019 He really was very biased.Xie Yu didn\u2019t want to talk about it. He stopped, stood in his dorm room doorway and said, \u201cAh, just an idiot.\u201dXie Yu\u2019s expression was frustrated, an air of annoyance emanating from him. If Zhong Jie were in front of him now, and if one were to hand Xie Yu a stick, he wouldn\u2019t hesitate to beat Zhong Jie to a pulp. He was that annoyed.He Zhao turned to one side. \u201cWant to come in and sit down?\u201dXie Yu didn\u2019t move.He Zhao said, \u201cI have sweets.\u201dXie Yu used words economically. If he could express what he wanted in two words he certainly would not use three.After listening for a while, He Zhao had gotten the gist of it. He suggested, perfectly seriously, \u201cIs your stepbrother a special needs child? Does he need to see a neurologist?\u201dXie Yu laughed. \u201cYes. Developmentally challenged child.\u201dHe Zhao suddenly remembered the orange cat from Xie Yu\u2019s profile. He pulled up the photo and showed Xie Yu. \u201cHow did this cat get so fat?\u201d\u201cThe whole street feeds it. How could it not get fat?\u201d Xie Yu glanced at it then asked, \u201cWhat are you looking at my profile for?\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d He Zhao stopped. \u201cJust looking.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThey chatted for a while, about everything from developmentally challenged children to the latest video game equipment, and then the conversation came around to Liu Cunhao\u2019s birthday. \u201cHao-zi\u2019s birthday is next weekend. Are you going?\u201dXie Yu thought about it. \u201cBirthday?\u201d\u201cDid you not notice him dropping hints?\u201d He Zhao dragged his chair closer. \u201cA wily one, he is.\u201dOver the last few days, Liu Cunhao had been hinting right and left about the things he liked, as if worried others wanted to buy him birthday gifts but weren\u2019t sure what to get. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I really like lately, but if I had to name something, it would be xx\u2019s new album\u2026 That\u2019s all right.\u201dWan Da was close to him and didn\u2019t require such roundabout hints\u2014Liu Cunhao had just sent him a Taobao\u00b9 link\u2014but no one else in the class escaped Liu Cunhao\u2019s attentions.Now that He Zhao had reminded him, Xie Yu finally realized Liu Cunhao\u2019s intentions. \u201cI thought he\u2019d gone mad.\u201dHe Zhao leaned against the back of his chair and laughed. \u201cIt was very obvious. Couldn\u2019t you tell? Hao-zi must be so embarrassed.\u201dXie Yu thought about the few conversations he had had with Liu Cunhao over the past few days and suddenly wanted to laugh. \u201cHe didn\u2019t speak plainly. How was I to know?\u201dIt was rare for the two of them to sit together talking about their classmates, and now the conversation suddenly cut off. For a while, neither of them spoke. Xie Yu felt uneasy for no real reason, and after he calmed down he found the atmosphere was a little more strange than just simply awkward.He couldn\u2019t sit still any longer and got up. \u201cI\u2019ll\u2026 go then.\u201dBefore he finished, He Zhao had already caught the hem of his shirt.He was wearing a button-down and the overall image was of someone who didn\u2019t really care about anything: a little languid, a smile always on his lips, as if there were many things in the world to be happy about.He Zhao swallowed, then said\u2014both to himself and to Xie Yu\u2014\u201cIt\u2019ll pass.\u201dIt\u2019ll pass.Even if it feels like being imprisoned right now.As long as you put in a little effort, and if that doesn\u2019t work, a little more\u2026 and walk forward, the life you want and all the answers you were looking for\u2026 will be there.\u201cGo.\u201d He Zhao let go and smiled. \u201cGoodnight, little friend.\u201dXie Yu stood, stunned, then after a moment, said goodnight, too.The next day.The wily guy who had been labeled \u2018mad\u2019 was now formally inviting everyone to attend his birthday gathering that weekend. He had even written invitations.Xie Yu received one, too. Inside was written the time and place: next Sunday, 9 a.m. at Central Avenue.He Zhao pretended to be put on the spot. \u201cHao-zi, about a gift\u2026\u201dLiu Cunhao waved a hand dismissively, putting on a magnanimous air as if he hadn\u2019t been dropping hints wildly just a few days ago. \u201cGifts aren\u2019t important. Your good wishes mean more! Before our friendship, all those things are unimportant.\u201dXie Yu said, \u201c\u2026You really want to save face that much?\u201dXu Qingqing and Wan Da couldn\u2019t keep listening and threw writing implements at him. \u201cBullshit! What\u2019s this about good wishes meaning more! Aren\u2019t you embarrassed saying that!\u201dWan Da said, \u201cShall I help you remember that Taobao link you sent me? Hao-zi, think about that link, then talk.\u201dLiu Cunhao put his head in his hands, hiding. \u201cSo rough. Especially you, Qing-ge. You won\u2019t be able to get married like that.\u201dHe Zhao stirred the pot. \u201cHao-zi, how can you say that to Qing-ge?\u201dXu Qingqing was about to go to the faculty office to get the English homework, but on hearing this she started rolling up her sleeves. She gritted out, \u201cCome on. Come over here, if you dare.\u201dLiu Cunhao dashed outside. \u201cI\u2019d be stupid if I went.\u201dLiu Cunhao had invited everyone out for an outing and then a meal for his birthday.Xie Yu had intended to skip, but seeing how excited Liu Cunhao was, he couldn\u2019t think of how to refuse. He Zhao patted his head and said, as if he\u2019d anticipated everything, \u201cYes, he\u2019s going.\u201dXie Yu thought, Going, your ass.Madam Gu was even more excited than Liu Cunhao about this class birthday gathering.Xie Yu\u2019s previous friends were all from Black Water Street. She hadn\u2019t noticed Xie Yu making many new friends after moving.Even falling in with Zhou Dalei and the others had taken Xie Yu a long time. Since the accident when he was young, people had beat them while they were down. Friends and family all chased them away. Now that Gu Xuelan thought about it, during those years when she had taken Xie Yu here and there and suffered the judgmental gazes of others, she had thought Xie Yu wasn\u2019t old enough to understand, but he had seen and understood it all.So Xie Yu had gradually grown quieter and subconsciously defensive when meeting people for the first time. He was very wary.\u201cYour classmate, the class rep,\u201d Gu Xuelan began with a smile. \u201cHave you bought him a present? You must be polite and wish him a happy birthday. Be sweeter. Isn\u2019t this nice? Go out with your classmates more often and take some photos\u2026 Do you have enough money on you?\u201dXie Yu was a little annoyed at getting a lecture before he went out. He changed his shoes and walked outside. \u201cAll right, talk to you later. Mom, I\u2019m going out.\u201dIn school, everyone wore the school uniform and hairstyles were also regulated. They only chatted about homework and exams. Now that they had a chance to go out, everyone went a little mad.Xu Qingqing wore a pair of overalls, long hair loose, a small shoulder bag over her shoulder. When she appeared, everyone was surprised. \u201cWah, who is this? Are you from our class?\u201dXu Qingqing smiled. \u201cI\u2019m your Qing-ge.\u201dHe Zhao arrived early. He squatted by the side of the street, looking down at his phone.Liu Cunhao and the others quickly found that with this person in their group, they turned many heads. It seemed as if every girl that passed by would secretly take a second look. When Xie Yu arrived later\u2026 it would be unimaginable.Xie Yu\u2019s phone exploded with messages before he had even left the train.Are you here?At the train station entrance. The north one.Where are you?Xie Yu glanced down and walked as he replied, Ask again and I\u2019ll block you.He Zhao didn\u2019t reply.Several steps later, Xie Yu received a message: I\u2019m especially handsome today. You\u2019ll see me the moment you exit the station. The most eye-catching one in the group.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWan Da had changed his hairstyle and was skipping about on the platform. When he jumped, he glimpsed Xie Yu. \u201cI saw Yu-ge! Wah, Zhao-ge, today you two, black and white, a perfect match.\u201dEveryone glanced in the direction of the train station.He Zhao was wearing a black jacket; Xie Yu was wearing a white one and glancing down at something.Xie Yu\u2019s finger was currently on the block button. He hadn\u2019t yet pressed it when he heard cheering in front of him. When he looked up, all of Class 3 was waving at him. \u201cYu-ge, over here\u2014\u2014\u201dHe Zhao was standing right in front, smiling as he yelled, \u201cOld Xie!\u201d He really was the most eye-catching of the lot.Not all of Class 3 was here\u2014there were twelve people. The others were attending remedial lessons and couldn\u2019t make it.\u201cShall we sing karaoke after lunch?\u201d Liu Cunhao said as he collected his presents, arms filling up so quickly he couldn\u2019t take any more. \u201cAh, don\u2019t give them to me yet. Give them to me when we eat cake later, so it feels more ceremonial. And I don\u2019t have to carry them, either.\u201dEating this meal was like fighting a war.Every dish was fought over. Luo Wenqiang was upfront about the fact that he hadn\u2019t eaten dinner last night just so he could eat this meal.Xie Yu frowned as he watched. He didn\u2019t participate in the battle but he did open his camera app to take a photo.\u201c\u2026Bros, you\u2019re too much.\u201d He Zhao was also embroiled in the fight for food, almost getting his whole sleeve soaked in oil as he snatched a piece of fish belly and put it in Xie Yu\u2019s bowl. \u201cAre you trying to starve my deskmate to death?\u201dXie Yu\u2019s hand trembled and the viewfinder listed to one side.The resulting photo contained no people, just six or seven pairs of entangled chopsticks and the steamed fish in a sorry state in the middle of the table. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe Zhao was just like a stray dog who had picked up some meat and was hiding it in its nest, only the nest was Xie Yu\u2019s bowl.He Zhao snatched a piece of sweet and sour ribs from someone and put it in Xie Yu\u2019s bowl, saying, \u201cOld Xie, don\u2019t be so image conscious.\u00b2 Children who care so much about appearances won\u2019t get food.\u201dHe emphasized, \u201cMy chopsticks are clean\u2026 quick, eat. Do you see how the gym rep is eyeing it?\u201dXie Yu opened his mouth, unsure what to say, and eventually called out, \u201cHe Zhao.\u201dHe Zhao was still fighting Luo Wenqiang for the last piece of corn pie and wasn\u2019t paying attention. He said distractedly, \u201cMm?\u201dXie Yu paused, then said again, \u201cZhao-ge.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The only respectful name he had called him was \u2018Big Bro Flirt,\u2019 but that wasn\u2019t complimentary, either.So now the words \u2018Zhao-ge,\u2019 said in an even tone without inflection, left He Zhao stunned.He almost dropped his chopsticks.By the time He Zhao came back to his senses, Luo Wenqiang had snatched the final piece of corn pie with his bare hands.Luo Wenqiang had one foot on his chair, his posture open. He had done his utmost to seize food, forgoing chopsticks and using his hands directly. \u201cHa ha ha ha ha, Zhao-ge, admit defeat!\u201dXu Qingqing said, \u201cGym rep, I really didn\u2019t imagine you to be this sort of person.\u201dLiu Cunhao shook his head. \u201cI didn\u2019t, either\u2026 There\u2019s nothing he won\u2019t stoop to for food. Tell me, did you really forgo just dinner? Surely you didn\u2019t go the whole day without food.\u201dLuo Wenqiang bit into the corn pie and explained, \u201cNot that far, not that far. I just have a big appetite, that\u2019s all.\u201dHe Zhao cleared his throat, about to ask why Xie Yu was calling him big bro.Xie Yu said, \u201cI don\u2019t like corn pie.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t get the pie, anyway,\u201d He Zhao said. \u201cThen what do you want to eat?\u201dXie Yu pointed at the steaming pot of three-ingredient soup.\u00b9The food on the table was already a mess. The remaining dishes were a plate of vegetables on which were piled several shrimp, and a small rib that had come from a different dish.He Zhao stared at the mess and thought, Let alone a bowl of soup, I\u2019ll do anything!He Zhao reached out to turn the lazy susan. After it had rotated halfway, his hand stilled and he asked, \u201cYou want some soup, right? Call me big bro again and I\u2019ll get it for you.\u201dHe Zhao thought the little bastard certainly wouldn\u2019t listen to him and might even kick him instead. Or even fold up his sleeves and, in his cold and haughty manner, bestow the words, \u201cGet lost.\u201dBut the little bastard just called him again. \u201cZhao-ge.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe Zhao felt his throat tighten.Almost everyone he knew called him Zhao-ge.But the words were different coming from Xie Yu.When he said them, a piece of He Zhao\u2019s heart seemed to collapse in his chest.His thoughts were in chaos. Eventually the hundreds and thousands of words formed a sentence: Fuck, something is very wrong.Xie Yu\u2019s mind was in chaos, too.He stared at the bowl of soup for a long time, then stirred it with a spoon.Actually, he didn\u2019t really dislike corn pie and didn\u2019t really want the three-ingredient soup, either.So\u2026 what was he really trying to do?Did he simply, having touched some nerve, want to call He Zhao big bro?\u201cHow about some wine?\u201d Liu Cunhao asked.Luo Wenqiang said with his mouth full, \u201cYes, yes! That little bit isn\u2019t enough to fill the gaps in my teeth.\u201dThe group rarely went out and, without supervision, they all acted like grown-ups, ordering food and wine. The alcohol especially seemed to erase a line of some sort; the moment they drank, the boundaries they usually maintained all disappeared.He Zhao and Liu Cunhao both downed a few bottles.Xie Yu drank a little, too. He didn\u2019t drink too much, but he felt it go to his head.The service at the restaurant Liu Cunhao had found was very good. When the birthday cake was brought out, the lights in the private room went out. Xie Yu was still drinking soup when the surroundings went dark.Someone asked, \u201cDid the power go out?\u201dThe next moment, the waiter pushed open the door to the private room. On the trolley was a big birthday cake with 17 lit candles on it, the small flames glowing faintly, flickering in the wind as the trolley moved forward.Someone started singing a birthday song, and then everyone joined in. \u201cHappy birthday to you~\u201dXie Yu sang, too. His voice was overpowered by Wan Da and the others, but He Zhao, who was close by, caught a few notes.He sang quite well.After the song, everyone applauded and shouted, \u201cMake a wish! Blow out the candles!\u201dLiu Cunhao closed his eyes and made a wish, then blew out the candles. He didn\u2019t blow them all out in a single breath and the others joined in on blowing them out, too. After they all went out, Luo Wenqiang said excitedly, \u201cLet\u2019s cut the cake!\u201dLiu Cunhao laughed and nudged him. \u201cYou haven\u2019t eaten your damn fill yet? All you do is eat. How do you manage it in the school cafeteria?\u201d\u201cI make do,\u201d Luo Wenqiang said. \u201c\u2026I get two sets every day. What else can I do?\u201dAfter making a ruckus, everyone got a piece of chocolate cake.Wan Da quietly stole some icing from the remainder of the cake on the trolley, crept up behind Liu Cunhao, waved his icing covered hand over Liu Cunhao\u2019s head, and winked at everyone.Everyone paid attention.Liu Cunhao was occupied with opening presents. He had had a thick enough face to demand them, but when he opened them he still acted surprised, as if they were unexpected. \u201cWow, heavens, I\u2019ve always wanted this! My dear Da, you understand me so well\u2026\u201dBefore he finished, his dear Da had given him a faceful of cake icing.Wan Da had struck the first blow.More and more people joined in the icing game until everyone was running back and forth in the private room.Xie Yu hadn\u2019t eaten more than a few bites of cake. He Zhao backed out of the huge fight but hadn\u2019t had his fill of excitement, and seeing his little friend sitting alone, he walked over and slapped Xie Yu\u2019s shoulder. When Xie Yu glanced up at him, he smeared icing on Xie Yu\u2019s face.Xie Yu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cOld Xie, you can\u2019t escape,\u201d He Zhao said. \u201cThe icing has to be smeared.\u201dThen Liu Cunhao and the others watched the two fist-happy big bros of their class start fighting again.Only this time it was an icing war.Xie Yu grabbed a fistful of icing and dropped it on He Zhao\u2019s head. \u201cYou fucking\u2014it\u2019s fun, is it, is this fun?\u201dAlthough everyone called Xu Qingqing Qing-ge, she was a girl after all, and although she was on the offensive, no one attacked her. When she grew tired, she stopped to rest, then pulled out her phone and smiled as she took a photo. \u201cAh\u2014Shall we take a group photo? I\u2019ll count three, two, one, and everyone yell eggplant.\u201dHe Zhao was naturally performative in front of a camera, and even though there was icing on his face and in his hair, he still hooked an arm around Xie Yu\u2019s neck, trying to pose. \u201cEggplant! Old Xie, look at the camera.\u201dXie Yu clearly didn\u2019t want to cooperate. \u201cLook, my ass.\u201dXu Qingqing didn\u2019t worry about whether they were ready. She was ready, anyway, and hit the camera button with a click.The class rep had turned seventeen.Everyone\u2019s face was a mess, especially Liu Cunhao\u2019s; only his eyes were still showing.And in the last row, two boys, one in black, one in white.Xu Qingqing suddenly thought, How nice.After reading so many YA novels, she felt that her daily life wasn\u2019t very exciting, and was very ordinary and unspecial\u2014all she did was worry about the exams and light a desk lamp late into the night doing homework\u2014but this was very nice.After they finished dinner and destroyed the cake, Xie Yu pulled out several napkins to clean his face and found that he couldn\u2019t wipe the stickiness away.He Zhao suggested he go to the washroom to wash it off. Worried that the bathroom would be crammed full later, they slipped out through the back door.\u201cYou went too hard.\u201d He Zhao put his head under the tap and washed. \u201cWhere else?\u201dXie Yu washed up quickly\u2014he only had a little on his face and nose\u2014then started meticulously cleaning his hands. He glanced sideways and said, \u201cBack of neck.\u201dHe Zhao lowered his head and put a hand behind his neck to check. \u201cHere?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Xie Yu said. \u201cLower.\u201dHe Zhao fumbled around for a while and didn\u2019t find anything. His back was getting sore from bending over the sink and he leant against the sink, saying, \u201cYou\u2019re kidding, right?\u201dXie Yu reached out\u2014his hands were still wet and the feeling of his hands on He Zhao\u2019s neck was chilly. \u201cHere.\u201dHe Zhao: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dLiu Cunhao and the others couldn\u2019t get clean with napkins, either, and ended up following them to the bathroom.Seeing He Zhao and Xie Yu in the bathroom, both wearing strange expressions on their faces, he asked curiously, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dXie Yu said nothing. He let someone else use the sink and walked out of the bathroom.He Zhao blinked, water dripping from his hair and catching on his eyelashes. He wiped his face with one hand. \u201cNothing. Then\u2026 I\u2019m done. You all wash up.\u201dLiu Cunhao didn\u2019t think too much more about it. Wan Da and Luo Wenqiang had rushed over to take the two empty spots and he said with pain, \u201cThe two of you\u2026 can you treat the birthday boy a little nicer?\u201dLuo Wenqiang shook his head, laughing as he stuck his head even further under the sink\u2014and out of the stream of water.Wan Da wasn\u2019t doing much better. He started twisting in front of the mirror. \u201cMusic.\u201dLiu Cunhao felt that something was wrong. \u201cYou all aren\u2019t\u2026 drunk, are you?\u201dThey had agreed to sing karaoke, but now that several drunkards had appeared among them they had to give up.\u201cHao-zi, you and Dingding carry the gym rep back,\u201d He Zhao said as he helped Wan Da along. \u201cOld Xie and I will take care of this one. Take them straight back to school.\u201dWan Da\u2019s steps were wobbly and when he heard \u2018back to school,\u2019 he bid the class rep farewell with his last shred of conscious thought. \u201cHao, Hao-zi, happy birthday.\u201dLiu Cunhao was having a tough time holding Luo Wenqiang up. \u201cThank you. Let\u2019s do that, then\u2026 Damn it, how are these two so bad at holding their drinks?\u201d\u201cIf he were just a lightweight, that would be fine,\u201d Xie Yu said. \u201cBut he was even boasting so much about how he could drink a thousand cups without getting drunk.\u201dHe Zhao said, \u201cThese two don\u2019t know their true abilities.\u201dThey had still called for bottle after bottle of beer.Yelling about how this little bit of beer is nothing, I don\u2019t feel anything, I\u2019m definitely the stuff of legends who won\u2019t get drunk even after a thousand cups! Come on! Cheers!They hailed a cab. Thank goodness Wan Da wasn\u2019t that awful a drunk and stopped dancing and making a scene. When he got into the car, he fell asleep.\u201cSir, we\u2019re going to Erzhong.\u201d\u201cErzhong, huh? You\u2019re a hardworking one.\u201d The driver checked the route and then focused on driving.Silence the whole way.He Zhao was quite good at holding his alcohol, but today he was drinking with Liu Cunhao so he drank a little more. Now that he had calmed down he felt warm all over.His stomach felt like it was burning up, too.He turned to the window to get some air and saw that his little friend had fallen asleep by his side.Xie Yu\u2019s hand was just next to his. The hand which had touched his neck, still dripping water. The hand he had grasped on the first day of school as he asked Xie Yu about the black nail polish.The night whistled by outside the window.He Zhao felt that the feelings he had been pushing down all day, brought out by these insignificant little details, were now all pouring out.As Shen Jie said, about to explode.Xie Yu had a headache and the bumping of the car made it worse. He shut his eyes to rest, but his mind was clear. As he dozed, he felt someone grasp his hand.But this time it was different. Their fingers were laced together.The boy\u2019s fingers were long and solid and got in the way. He Zhao held it carefully, as if trying not to jolt him, or trying not to use too much force. And his hand was warm, so warm it seemed to be burning up, the heat transferring to Xie Yu alongside the rhythm of his heartbeat.Xie Yu felt himself start to burn up, too.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He didn\u2019t feel any of the unidentifiable emotion from before. He didn\u2019t want to hit anyone anymore. He would let He Zhao keep his damn life a little longer.The unidentifiable frustration now seemed to have found an outlet\u2014an answer began to take shape, barely noticeable.Maybe it had been there all along.The interior of the cab was nearly silent. Aside from Wan Da humming in his sleep in the front seat, there were the sounds of other cars passing by and honking.It was nearly evening and the sky was growing dark. When the cab turned onto a side road, Wan Da smacked his lips and woke up again, asking in confusion and fear, \u201cWhere\u2019s my light? Lighting crew?\u201dAsking for music so he could dance, and now asking for lighting, too. He was probably dreaming of being an international superstar.When Wan Da finished speaking, Xie Yu felt He Zhao\u2019s hand stiffen in his. He seemed very anxious and even his breathing grew shallow.Thankfully, Wan Da then closed his eyes and sank back into a deep sleep.He Zhao moved his fingers, wondering whether to let go.After a long time, he didn\u2019t move. He couldn\u2019t bear to let go.The red light changed and the car kept moving forward. The number on the fare meter steadily ticked upward from its base fare.After an indeterminate amount of time the surroundings grew familiar. Then the cab turned into a side street near Erzhong. Now they could see the classroom building, which was the flagship building of Liyang Erzhong. It was the tallest in the school and had the school\u2019s motto written on the top.\u201cUp here, right?\u201d The driver turned the cab. \u201cQuite an impressive school. Which year are you?\u201d\u201cSecond year.\u201d\u201cSecond year, huh\u2026 My son is in his third year, so one year above you. Students these days have it hard. You have to do your homework late into the night, and I must say\u2026 studying is important, but your health is important, too.\u201dXie Yu was pretending to sleep, and this pretense was tiring. Especially for his neck, which was twisted so his head could rest against the back of the seat.Seeing they were about to arrive at school, He Zhao tried to let go and withdraw his hand while his little friend wouldn\u2019t notice. \u201cIt\u2019s quite tiring. Hope your son does well on the high school exams\u2026\u201dHe suddenly cut himself off.He was just starting to let go when Xie Yu\u2014initially passive, his fingers slack\u2014suddenly tightened his own hand, fingertips resting on the back of He Zhao\u2019s hand suddenly gripping it tightly.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe Zhao really was going to explode this time.The cab driver was still discussing his son. \u201cHe lost so much weight, my heart hurts for him. Third year is exhausting. Endure\u2026 everyone just has to endure. No one gets to escape, wouldn\u2019t you say? When you get into a university, things will be better. So being tired now is worth it\u2026\u201dNo one listened to the driver\u2019s ramblings.In the few minutes they had left, the two remained as they were, fingers intertwined. Neither of them spoke or looked at each other. When the cab stopped and the driver was waiting to collect the fare, he discovered neither of his passengers in the back seat were moving. \u201cErzhong, wasn\u2019t it? We\u2019re here. Erzhong.\u201dXie Yu was calm. He looked at He Zhao and gently moved his hand. Only now did He Zhao come back to his senses, and his thoughts whirled once before he suddenly let go.Xie Yu watched as He Zhao hurriedly fumbled for his wallet and even failed to count his money correctly. The fare was thirty yuan but he only pulled out a twenty.The driver held the twenty and was a little worried. \u201cCan you count?\u201dXie Yu\u2019s discomfort had now all but vanished and he couldn\u2019t stop himself from cursing. \u201cIdiot.\u201d\u201cThirty, was it. Ah, thirty.\u201d He Zhao fumbled for a long time before pulling out a ten. \u201cSorry. Heard wrong.\u201dXie Yu circled around to the passenger seat, bent down, patted Wan Da\u2019s face, and pulled Wan Da out of the seat.Wan Da walked as if he were stepping on cotton balls. Unsteady on his feet, he asked, \u201cAh? Is it my turn to go on stage?\u201d\u201cYes, superstar,\u201d Xie Yu said. \u201cIt\u2019s your turn to go on stage.\u201dWan Da was very happy. Looking at the streetlamps lining the road, he felt like he was standing center stage. \u201cWhat song would you like to hear?\u201dXie Yu caught hold of his collar, dragging him toward the school. \u201cHow about Loyalty to the Country?\u201dWan Da immediately paused.Ever since Dean Jiang had made Loyalty to the Country a school-wide wake-up call, the song had become a shadow in every live-in student\u2019s heart that could not be wiped away.He Zhao paid the fare and came over to help. The two helped Wan Da walk, one on either side. Many times they wanted to say something, but the words died on their lips; nothing seemed suitable.Aside from that, they still had to deal with Wan Da\u2019s intermittent drunken outbursts. For instance, when they were going up the stairs, he suddenly shouted, \u201cFriends in the audience, let me see your hands!\u201dHe couldn\u2019t see their hands so he stood in the stairwell and wouldn\u2019t move.\u201cThat is the stairwell, not the audience stand. You normally aren\u2019t this annoying, are you?\u201d He Zhao was thoroughly defeated. \u201cDon\u2019t make me take action.\u201dWan Da clutched the railing, adamant on keeping his superstar dignity.Xie Yu had washed his hands of the matter and sat on the stairs to watch the show.He watched He Zhao retreat several paces and wave, fulfilling Wan Da\u2019s wish.Wan Da waved excitedly back at him. \u201cMy fans, my friends.\u201dXie Yu covered his mouth with his hand, stifling a laugh. \u201cThis is what you meant by take action?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t laugh.\u201dHe Zhao reminded, \u201c\u2026Don\u2019t tell anyone about this. I get embarrassed, too.\u201dThey had classes the next day, and students had been trickling back into school since noon. Both Wan Da\u2019s suitemates were back, so when they returned the \u2018superstar\u2019 to his room, Xie Yu leaned against the doorway and said, \u201cTake care.\u201dWan Da\u2019s two suitemates had no idea the depth of meaning \u201cTake care\u201d had until Wan Da jumped onto the bed and started dancing. \u201cDamn it, how much did he drink?\u201d\u201cHey, take care of him,\u201d He Zhao said. \u201cIf you really can\u2019t stand it anymore, get a stick and knock him out.\u201dThey walked out of Wan Da\u2019s dorm room and headed toward the third floor.That oppressive atmosphere which made it hard to breathe had returned again.Xie Yu suddenly remembered when, around second year in junior high, Zhou Dalei was chasing his crush. Rumor had it the girl liked guys with talent, so he learned to play the guitar and wrote a song, singing day in and day out in the street, \u201cOh baby, you are the rose with thorns\u2026\u201dEvery time he practiced he was able to collect the many presents thrown at him by the residents of Black Water Street\u2014pots, crockery, plates, and even some bricks.Only Da Mei provided positive moral support. \u201cBro, actually, your song is quite okay. Have some faith in yourself.\u201d\u201cReally? Is it really okay?\u201dZhou Dalei\u2019s injured soul clearly needed more comfort, so he glanced at Xie Yu, who took his earplugs out of his ears and said mercilessly, \u201cAre you done singing?\u201dSo merciless it was hackle-raising. In response, Zhou Dalei had said, unhappily as he held his guitar, \u201cBoss Xie, you\u2019ve never liked anyone. You don\u2019t understand love.\u201dXie Yu was, in matters of the heart, very cold.But just because he left things unsaid didn\u2019t mean he didn\u2019t know they were there.He didn\u2019t like dragging things out. If something was wrong, just spit it out. Don\u2019t make trouble.Before, someone with a crush on him who didn\u2019t dare confess had made such a scene that everyone knew, to the point it was as if something of significance really had happened between them. Even Dalei had come over and wink-wink-nudged-nudged. \u201cI heard that, who was it, about that, did you two really\u2026\u201dThe next day, Xie Yu had gone in search of that person and said only two things:You like me?Sorry, I don\u2019t like you.He Zhao was annoying, too. And a big annoyance who got him mixed up in shenanigans, at that.Now that things had come to this, they couldn\u2019t both keep playing dumb.Xie Yu\u2019s thought process was very simple. If there was something to say, he\u2019d say it. However he thought, whatever he wanted to do.Walking to his dorm room door, He Zhao\u2019s mind was full of fireworks going off. Like when he couldn\u2019t properly count out thirty bucks, he had opened the door, walked in, then closed the door by the time he came back to his senses.Xie Yu watched the idiot enter his room. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dIs there something wrong with him?Xie Yu walked over, but before he could knock the door opened.He Zhao stood in the doorway. \u201cI\u2026\u201dXie Yu cut him off. \u201cAre you drunk.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d He Zhao was a little stunned, but he quickly figured out what Xie Yu meant. He paused, then asked in return, \u201cAre you\u2026 drunk?\u201dXie Yu said, \u201cIdiot, what do you think?\u201dHe wasn\u2019t drunk.It wasn\u2019t the alcohol acting up.It wasn\u2019t a momentary impulse, either.\u201cYou called me Zhao-ge before. Why idiot again?\u201d\u201cYou are an idiot.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dFrom the corridor came the sound of luggage wheels and the noise of several people making a racket as they came down the stairs.With incredible childishness they bandied, \u201cyou\u2019re the idiot,\u201d back and forth several times. Then Xie Yu stood still in the middle of the racket and said, \u201cHe Zhao, you provoked me first.\u201dYou provoked me first.Invaded his life with so much noise.Insisting on breaking past all of his defenses.The moment Xie Yu finished, He Zhao grabbed his wrist and pulled him into the dorm room. Xie Yu\u2019s back hit the door with a jolt of pain. \u201cDamn, are you crazy?\u201dThey were very close together. He Zhao\u2019s arm was on the door by Xie Yu\u2019s ear, and he finally couldn\u2019t hold it in any more. Even if Xie Yu crippled him when he said it, he was willing.\u201cI\u2019ve\u2026 never liked anyone before.\u201d\u201cThe one in front of me, my little friend called Xie Yu, is the first.\u201dHe Zhao wasn\u2019t sure how to say it. He had no experience confessing, and in Shen Jie\u2019s words he was EQ-challenged. After a pause, he continued. \u201cEven though my little friend is bad-tempered and beats people up at the drop of a hat, I still like him very much.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a very serious like. I\u2019m happy when I see him. I want to date him. I love him like my life.\u201dWhen He Zhao was done confessing, he asked, \u201cDid my bad-tempered little friend hear that?\u201dThe bad-tempered little friend very much wanted to punch someone right now.Who says such things?Asking for a beating.\u201cI\u2019ve never liked anyone either.\u201dXie Yu held back his desire to punch someone and said, \u201cThe idiot called He Zhao in front of me is the first.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He usually had so many canned responses up his sleeve, but now he stood there like a mute, pinning Xie Yu against the door and staring at him.Xie Yu wasn\u2019t aware that He Zhao was currently thinking, Damn, these fireworks have been going off for a long time. Why are they not yet done?Xie Yu\u2019s wrist was still trapped in his hand and Xie Yu pulled a little. \u201cHave you looked enough?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dHearing Xie Yu\u2019s voice, He Zhao came back to himself. He couldn\u2019t help smiling a little, then widely. He repeated, \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t looked enough.\u201dXie Yu\u2019s words, \u201cYou provoked me first,\u201d were originally going to be followed by, If you just want to try something novel and fun, then I have no free time to play with you.He wasn\u2019t sure what exactly He Zhao\u2019s \u2018like\u2019 counted for, so he chose to defend himself. Almost pessimistically, he wanted a clean conclusion.He even thought He Zhao would back off.But He Zhao had not.He had said that his feelings were very serious; the sort of like where he wanted to date him.Xie Yu felt he\u2019d been infected by He Zhao. He started smiling, too, and couldn\u2019t force the corners of his lips down even if he tried. Very silly. So he moved his hand, opened the door, and started to leave. \u201cI\u2019m going back.\u201dHe Zhao didn\u2019t hold him back but once he had taken two steps out of the room, He Zhao called out to him again from behind. \u201cXie Yu.\u201dXie Yu opened the door to his room, turned back and leaned against the doorframe to look up at He Zhao.He Zhao wasn\u2019t done and called his name again.Xie Yu was a little annoyed now and almost said, \u201cAre you calling a spirit?\u201dHe Zhao stood at the opposite door. The zip of his black jacket was only pulled up halfway, a rebellious look. Xie Yu only now noticed that he had secretly put on ear studs.He Zhao said, \u201cNothing. Just getting used to my boyfriend\u2019s name.\u201dThese words sounded familiar, as if Xie Yu had heard them somewhere before. Before he could react, He Zhao continued, \u201cLet\u2019s take care of each other in the future, boyfriend.\u201dHe remembered now.On the first day of school, He Zhao had sat in the last row and called his name this way, too. Saying, languidly, \u201cGetting used to my new deskmate\u2019s name\u2026 Let\u2019s take care of each other in the future, deskmate.\u201dNow He Zhao was saying these words again, but the relationship had changed from \u2018deskmate\u2019 to \u2018boyfriend.\u2019What a strange feeling.As if they had come full circle.The two of them stood in their doorways, staring at each other, for a long time.This felt a little like young lovers on the phone saying, \u201cGoodnight, I\u2019m hanging up,\u201d even as neither of them hung up, both being silly and listening to each other\u2019s quiet breathing instead.\u201cGo on in,\u201d He Zhao said. \u201cRest early.\u201dXie Yu turned, went into his room, and shut the door.Xie Yu took a shower and did several mock papers. He thought he would be unable to concentrate, but when he put pen to paper and started doing sums, he found he was fine.He picked several questions, finished them, then flipped the page. When he had finished the paper for each subject, he looked up from the sea of questions and discovered it was nearly 11 p.m.Only when he closed his eyes and got ready to sleep did he suddenly clearly feel\u2026 his own heartbeat, which had not yet calmed down.Before falling asleep, the last thought that surfaced in Xie Yu\u2019s mind was, Fuck, young love.\u00b9The next day, Dean Jiang punctually broadcast his event as scheduled in the morning. He was never late and never absent. With his voice, he infused all the students in the dormitories with energy. \u201cStudents, it\u2019s a new day. Are you happy?\u201dThe moment Dean Jiang started speaking, someone had already pulled their covers over their head and groaned, \u201cAh\u2026 heavens\u2026\u201d\u201cThis is inhumane\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy is life like this to us helpless children?\u201dDean Jiang was ignorant of the terrible state inside the school dorms and was still immersed in his rah-rah speech.\u201cThe mid-term exams are almost upon us! Dear students, are you excited? This is not only an exam, but the season of harvest for your fruits of victory. Get out of bed\u2026 get out! Students who want high grades!\u201dXie Yu endured it for a while before he finally couldn\u2019t endure any more. He stuck his hand out from beneath the blankets, groping upwards, and retracted his hand again when he couldn\u2019t find his earplugs.The corridor began to fill with people.Amidst the commotion, many people called out, \u201cZhao-ge.\u201d He Zhao made a round of greetings, then walked to the door opposite his and knocked. \u201cOld Xie, are you up?\u201dXie Yu tossed his alarm clock in response, which crashed into the door, bounced back, and rolled around on the floor twice.He Zhao: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dSomeone was watching from the sidelines. This scene repeated itself every day and, even more strangely, He Zhao wasn\u2019t angry. He squatted by the door in a good temper, waiting for the lord inside to get out of bed and open the door for him. One guy couldn\u2019t help going up and asking, \u201cZhao-ge, this\u2026 is Xie Yu of the West Building this bad-tempered every day?\u201d\u201cYeah,\u201d He Zhao smiled. \u201cCute, right?\u201dBefore the guy left he wondered if he had heard wrong. Zhao-ge said \u2018scary,\u2019 right? Or did he just not understand the word cute?After another two minutes or so, Xie Yu got up and opened the door for He Zhao.He Zhao hadn\u2019t slept all night. After Xie Yu had gone back last night, he had deleted his \u2018Aaaaaaa\u2019 mood message. But after deleting it he wasn\u2019t sure what to replace with it, so he typed another string of \u2018Aaaaaaaaaa\u2019 and hit send.Then he had lain wide awake until two or three a.m.All he could think was: Xie Yu was his now. His little friend.The moment He Zhao went through the door, he fell onto the bed. Xie Yu leaned against the door and watched, unsure what was wrong with him. He had his own bed, so why didn\u2019t he sleep in it. Did he have to come over and take Xie Yu\u2019s instead? \u201cDidn\u2019t sleep last night?\u201d\u201cSlept at three a.m.,\u201d He Zhao said, eyes half open. \u201cAre you going back to sleep?\u201dXie Yu said, \u201cYou took the bed. How can I sleep?\u201d\u201cBoyfriend.\u201d He Zhao scooched inwards to make space. \u201cCome on.\u201dXie Yu bent to pick up the alarm clock, then flung it at He Zhao again.Over the intercom, Dean Jiang was still making his announcement. \u201cRising early is a very good habit. For example, I wake up at 5:30 a.m. to breathe the fresh morning air. It\u2019s during this time you will understand just how wonderful life is.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dXie Yu had hesitated before opening the door. He had just confirmed this relationship and had not yet had time to let it sink in. In this brand-new relationship, this person, this idiot\u2014from today onwards, he wasn\u2019t just anyone else.Something had changed, but, at the same time, it seemed that nothing had.He wasn\u2019t sure how other people dated. Zhou Dalei\u2019s \u2018this is an example of what not to do\u2019 relationship didn\u2019t count.He had imagined that he might not be too comfortable, or that it might be strange or awkward. But when He Zhao had appeared he had stopped thinking.He Zhao, who was the sort to be late every day for 10,000 years, was actually on time.First period today was literature. Tang Sen praised and encouraged He Zhao to work hard and keep doing well, then lectured Wan Da. \u201cWhat happened? How come you\u2019re late today?\u201dWan Da had drunk too much yesterday, and his head was still hurting when he woke up in the morning. He really couldn\u2019t get out of bed this morning, but he\u2019d never admit that he was hungover for fear his parents might be called in. So he frantically recalled how He Zhao bullshitted every time he was late, and was finally able to come up with something. \u201cIt\u2019s like this, teach. This morning, Shen Jie from Class 8 had his illness flare up again.\u201dHe Zhao: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dXie Yu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dEveryone who was at the birthday party yesterday and was in the know: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAnd Shen Jie of class 8, who wasn\u2019t even here: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cHis, that, something-itis.\u201d Wan Da had forgotten what malady it even was; the name was so damn long no one could remember it. He got halfway and then got stuck. \u201cThat gastro\u2026\u201dHe Zhao piped up from the back, \u201cChronic non-atrophic gastritis.\u201dWan Da kept nodding. \u201cYes, yes, yes. That.\u201dTang Sen had a lot of faith in his students and Wan Da was usually a fairly good student. He had no track record of being late, and Shen Jie\u2026 his illness had indeed flared up several times. So Tang Sen said, \u201cWell done. If you see classmates who need help, you should help if you can. But come to think of it, that student from Class 8 really needs to take better care of himself. How did he land in the doctor\u2019s office twice in three days\u2026\u201dWan Da was breaking out in a cold sweat, and sat down, shell-shocked.Liu Cunhao and the others buried their faces in their elbows and howled silently with laughter.The class dismissal bell rang. When Old Tang had gone, they burst out laughing, getting progressively louder. \u201cHa ha ha ha ha ha ha ha, Shen Jie of Class 8! Impressive, Wan Da. You\u2019re very impressive.\u201dLiu Cunhao rubbed away his tears of laughter. \u201cWhat were you thinking?\u201dWan Da said, \u201cI was thinking of Zhao-ge. I wanted to do as he did.\u201dHe Zhao couldn\u2019t hold back his laughter either. \u201cYou can\u2019t goddamn copy it exactly. If you\u2019re so good you could say you helped an old granny cross the road. Thankfully Old Tang is silly. If it were Mad Dog, your dad might be on the way here to beat you.\u201dWan Da scratched his head. \u201cSo scary? Surely it\u2019s fine.\u201d\u201cGood, my ass,\u201d Xie Yu said. \u201cShen Jie is already on the way here to beat you.\u201dWan Da: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dLiu Cunhao and the others howled with laughter again.\u201cRight, do you know what you and gym rep were like after you got drunk?\u201d Xu Qingqing smiled as she remembered. \u201cThis was the first time I saw anybody get drunk. It was really something.\u201dWhen Wan Da woke up this morning, he didn\u2019t remember anything that had happened the day prior. He had asked his suitemates, but they had only shaken their heads. Of course, he didn\u2019t know that when he wasn\u2019t fully conscious his former prediction that Class 3 would \u2018take care of He Zhao and Xie Yu on their own\u2019 had come true.\u00b2 \u201cWhat was I like? I was all right, surely.\u201dXie Yu didn\u2019t want to say anything.He Zhao didn\u2019t want to go into too much detail, either, and said, \u201cYou\u2019re too confident.\u201dBetween classes, Shen Jie really did come over. He stood at the window and yelled, \u201cWan Da, good for you! Do you know that I just met your teacher on the way back from the bathroom? He asked me to take care of my health? I even thought I contracted a terminal disease without even knowing it.\u201dWhen Shen Jie was done yelling, he glanced in his Zhao-ge\u2019s direction out of habit. He found that his Zhao-ge and the emotionless killer had put their heads together, talking about something. It was a casual and ordinary scene, but he felt something wasn\u2019t right.He kept staring and discovered what wasn\u2019t quite right\u2026 where were his Zhao-ge\u2019s hands wandering?!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 74": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fake SlackersChapter 052 - Very eye-catching, as if he radiated light.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayFake SlackersTranslator: JuryEditor: NomNomFirst Published on Chaleuria\u2014052 \u2013 Very eye-catching, as if he radiated light.\u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cStay still. Got it.\u201dOne of Xie Yu\u2019s hands was in his pocket, the other acting as a pillow for his head. He looked down at the pen caught in his shirt. \u201cWhat did you throw?\u201dHe Zhao said, \u201cMy hand slipped. Really, my hand slipped.\u201dHe Zhao had finally painstakingly found the pen he had lost for several days in the corner of his desk compartment. Xie Yu thought He Zhao looked like a refugee, one so poor he couldn\u2019t feed his guests, who had suddenly received an unexpected windfall. \u201cDid you see, Old Xie? We have a pen now.\u201dXie Yu lay on the desk. He hadn\u2019t slept enough during the previous class period, so he made a lukewarm noise of assent. He had wanted to continue sleeping, but that pen had flown in his direction the very next second. If Xie Yu moved even a little now, it would fall to the floor.He Zhao was very close, his hands on top of Xie Yu\u2019s thigh; it was ticklish. If his hands wandered upwards just a few more centimeters they would touch something they shouldn\u2019t touch.Xie Yu turned away and said, a little stiffly, \u201cHurry the fuck up.\u201dHe Zhao hadn\u2019t thought much of it, initially. He loved his pen like he would love the last scion of his family. He finally realized when his fingers touched the pen cap.Shen Jie stood at the window, waiting for Xie Yu to kick his Zhao-ge\u2019s chair over, informing him that people can\u2019t just do as they please, that touching inappropriately came at a price. But he waited and waited, and the class bell rang but Xie Yu still hadn\u2019t moved.The Big Bro of the West Building just let his deskmate touch him for a while and even responded when He Zhao talked to him.Surreal.Shen Jie thought, I haven\u2019t seen them for a few days and the world has completely changed?!The last class of the morning was gym. Luo Wenqiang, who had suffered all morning, was now recovered from his headache and stood up excitedly. \u201cBrothers and sisters, see you on the court!\u201dHe Zhao stood up. \u201cIf Old Wu sees you he\u2019ll die of anger.\u201dDuring the math class just now, Wu Zheng had asked Luo Wenqiang to come up to the board and solve a problem, but Luo Wenqiang had said he was too weak that day to hold chalk. But now he was all fired up, as if he was about to take off his jacket and jump out the window and onto the basketball court.Luo Wenqiang opened his mouth, but Xie Yu, knowing he was looking for an excuse, interrupted before he could speak. \u201cDon\u2019t go on about the spirit of exercise.\u201d\u201cOld Xie.\u201d He Zhao stood in the doorway. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dLuo Wenqiang: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d These two are really presenting a united front today.\u201cTwo laps for warm-up.\u201d The gym teacher squatted by the rostrum, a whistle in his mouth, and said lazily, \u201cFree time after you\u2019re done.\u201dThe moment Xie Yu saw the gym teacher, he remembered the push-ups training, and along with it, the forum posts He Zhao had shown him at the sports meet. As he thought, he unintentionally met He Zhao\u2019s eyes.They stood at the back of the line and neither one of them spoke. Xie Yu averted his eyes, staring at the chaos on the soccer field. Someone walked by them with a bag of volleyballs. Then Xie Yu discovered that He Zhao was pressing the back of his hand against his, whether intentionally or not.The gym teacher narrowed his eyes and said, \u201cIf you want sports equipment, go to the gym rep. The gym rep will go to the equipment room to get everything all at once. Luo Wenqiang, are you still playing basketball today?\u201dLuo Wenqiang replied, \u201cYes, of course we are.\u201dThe gym teacher said, \u201cWe don\u2019t know if there will be a basketball tournament this term. I heard from the dean that he wants to try something new this year.\u201d\u201cWhat \u2018something new.\u2019\u201d Liu Cunhao had expended a great deal of effort getting on the basketball team and had kissed up to the gym rep for a long time. \u201cBecause of what happened last term?\u201d The last two classes standing after the round robin were both too competitive and almost started a fight. The classes had stayed enemies and glared at each other for the whole school term.The crowd murmured.No one noticed the small movements of the two people in the last row.The backs of their hands pressed together, they stayed that way, quietly, aware but silent.\u201cOld Xie,\u201d He Zhao suddenly said.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cBasketball later?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dLuo Wenqiang walked to the front of the row and led the class in their warm-up run. He ran backwards, hands in the air, and said, \u201cGirls, follow Qing-ge! Stay in line and don\u2019t fall behind.\u201dHe Zhao had been running at the end of the line, and while the gym teacher wasn\u2019t looking, he disregarded the line and ran forward one place, next to Xie Yu. He whispered, \u201cCan you run? Is your leg okay?\u201dHe\u2019d recovered long ago. It wasn\u2019t a serious injury in the first place and it had healed quickly. A few days\u2019 rest had been enough.Before Xie Yu could reply in the affirmative, Luo Wenqiang shouted, \u201cZhao-ge, what are you doing? Formation! Formation! You\u2019re too much.\u201dHe Zhao waved at Luo Wenqiang and returned to the back of the line.After jogging two laps and passing the finish line, everyone dispersed.Behind the quad, near the equipment room, there were a few grassy patches where the students not doing gym activities often sat to chat.Xie Yu looked for a place to sit down, but then he remembered that Class 3\u2019s study rep had gotten a hold of him last time\u2014Xue Xisheng really didn\u2019t miss any opportunity\u2014and had pulled out a pocket vocabulary book, saying, \u201cXie Yu, let me tell you about word stems. English word stems are very easy to remember, so I hope your English score will improve in the mid-term exams\u2026\u201dHe had better look for somewhere near the basketball court to hide.When Xie Yu appeared near the basketball courts, Luo Wenqiang\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cYu-ge!\u201dLuo Wenqiang had had his eye on Xie Yu for the basketball team from the start. No one had seen him play yet, but they all thought he would be very good. Only Wan Da held the ball quietly, remembering the last video game he had played with Xie Yu, then shook his head despondently.He really couldn\u2019t imagine such a single-player type playing a team game.He Zhao was taking off his jacket beneath the basketball hoop, leaving just a short-sleeved t-shirt behind. He tossed his jacket to the side, and hearing Luo Wenqiang holler, he glanced behind him.Luo Wenqiang said, \u201cYu-ge, did you come over to\u2026\u201dXie Yu said, \u201cNo, I\u2019ll just watch you all play.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dLuo Wenqiang was about to continue but Xu Qingqing called him from the gates. \u201cGym rep, are there more badminton rackets? We\u2019re short.\u201dLuo Wenqiang scratched his head and ran over. \u201cShort? I got enough for everyone in the class.\u201dHe Zhao leaned against the basketball stand, drawing eyes just by being there. Once Luo Wenqiang had departed, he bent to whisper in Xie Yu\u2019s ear, \u201cYou came to watch us\u2026 or came to watch me?\u201dXie Yu thought, Neither. Came to avoid the study rep.But He Zhao\u2019s breath against his ear was warm, and when he spoke his eyes sparkled, hinting fiercely at him. It was just about written on his face, Say you\u2019re here to watch me. Say it.\u201cCame to watch you.\u201d Xie Yu decided to give him face, and sighed. \u201cTo watch my boyfriend.\u201d\u201cZhao-ge\u2014\u2014\u201d Wan Da urged. \u201cDone?\u201dHe Zhao smiled and replied, \u201cComing,\u201d then patted Xie Yu\u2019s head and said, \u201cWatch closely. I\u2019ll show you how great a partner you picked.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dGreat, not so much. Shameless, on the other hand.The whole match, He Zhao seemed to be trying his utmost to draw attention to himself. He played both fierce and hard. When he did a three-step layup and leaped into the air, catching the wind, and his waist was faintly visible as he moved.He snatched the ball then ran clear across the court. He dribbled the ball past people when they were there, and when they weren\u2019t, he dribbled the ball through air.\u201cVery good. Now we see Zhao-ge dribble the ball through thin air again. A perfect pass. Perfect posture, brilliant and exciting. As if someone really was standing there.\u201d Liu Cunhao was the substitute for this round, and since he was sitting on the sidelines with nothing to do, he started commentating. \u201cVery awesome. Let us give Zhao-ge a round of applause.\u201dXie Yu laughed, then called him mad.He Zhao landed the basket before turning to glance in Xie Yu\u2019s direction. He put his index and middle finger to his lips, then blew a kiss.The huge group of onlookers screamed in unison, \u201cAhhh\u2014\u201dExcited discussion arose all around, trying to guess who the recipient of the flying kiss was. The people in the area glanced at each other, searching for a clue.But the true recipient of the kiss didn\u2019t seem moved at all.Xie Yu, leaning back on his hands next to the flowerbed, thought, Yes, quite cool.He paused, then thought, Forget it. I\u2019ll be compassionate. Take the word \u2018quite\u2019 away.He was cool.The drama king really was eye-catching. As if he radiated light.After He Zhao had played for a while, the people playing with him couldn\u2019t take it any more, especially Wan Da, who felt completely useless on the court. If he took off his basketball tank he could even rest with Liu Cunhao on the sidelines. He Zhao was carrying the whole match, anyway. Didn\u2019t even need support.And the way he was posturing and feinting right and left, even his teammates didn\u2019t know what he was trying to do.\u201cTake a break, Zhao-ge,\u201d Luo Wenqiang advised. Before He Zhao could reply, Luo Wenqiang waved at the substitute. \u201cHao-zi, come up!\u201dHe Zhao said, \u201c\u2026Are you even human? Who was it that begged me to come in the first place?\u201dLuo Wenqiang said, \u201cI was wrong, all right? Now I know why you said you were too good and didn\u2019t want to disturb us. Your self-assessment was very accurate.\u201dThe price of showing off was that He Zhao was kicked off Class 3\u2019s basketball team forever, and the gym rep now deeply understood that the Big Bros of the East and West Buildings were not beings he could control.He Zhao walked off the court, disappointed. \u201cThey\u2019re inhumane.\u201dXie Yu said, \u201cYou\u2019re inhumane, too. Is passing the ball to air that fun?\u201dThe match began to grow exciting again. Liu Cunhao tried to pass someone with the ball, but failed, and had the ball snatched by the other player.He Zhao turned and asked, \u201cWasn\u2019t I cool?\u201dXie Yu replied, \u201cLike an idiot.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe two sat on the sidelines, watching the match. He Zhao took several gulps of water from a bottle, then handed it to Xie Yu. \u201cDrink?\u201dXie Yu wasn\u2019t thirsty but He Zhao handed it over so naturally that he just took it.When his lips touched the mouth of the bottle, he felt a faint wetness, the condensation rising from the drink inside\u2014\u2014He Zhao had touched this place just now, too.The same phrase surfaced in both their minds: Fuck, indirect kiss.He Zhao suddenly felt that the half a bottle he had just drunk had been rendered completely useless; his throat had suddenly gone dry. And his little friend\u2019s lips were moist and shining, and as he looked\u2026 he wanted to\u2026 ah, better stop looking.He Zhao coughed and forced himself to keep watching Hao-zi and the others play basketball.Xie Yu wasn\u2019t much better off. He held onto the bottle for so long his fingertips started going numb, and only then did he return the bottle to He Zhao.He Zhao scrambled to cap the bottle again. His fingers fumbled with the cap for a long time before his hand slipped, the cap dropping to the ground and rolling around in the grass.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Might as well offer incense and prayers.In Xie Yu\u2019s seventeen years of living, he had never felt that he had very much youthful ardor.Before, Zhou Dalei and the others had secretly rented R-rated DVDs, hidden them from Madam Gu and Dalei\u2019s parents, and locked their doors, not even daring to breathe loudly.The young Dalei had watched the tapes red-faced without averting his eyes. Xie Yu had glanced at the screen twice, then booted up an old tube TV to the side and played on his Famicom game console.What had Dalei said back then? He had said, \u201cBoss Xie, you aren\u2019t asexual, are you?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s so special about it,\u201d Xie Yu said. \u201cIt\u2019s just sex, isn\u2019t it?\u201dZhou Dalei: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dDa Mei: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dBut he was in a relationship now, right?It was just drinking from the same bottle of water.Why did his heart speed up?A sharp whistle signalled the end of gym class.The gym teacher walked out of the stadium and waved to Luo Wenqiang. Liu Cunhao, who was holding the ball, used the last few seconds to jump and toss the ball into the basket.\u201cClass is over. Dismissed.\u201d The gym teacher instructed the gym rep to pack up the equipment.Gym rep Luo Wenqiang couldn\u2019t carry the whole class\u2019s gym equipment, so He Zhao jumped down from his perch next to the flowerbed and went to help. \u201cI\u2019ll take the rackets. Old Xie, lend a hand?\u201dXie Yu took half the rackets and the group walked in a line toward the equipment room. Liu Cunhao was still holding the basketball, refusing to let it go.\u201cIt\u2019s all the fault of those two classes from last year. Idiots, the lot of them. They even fought. What\u2019s there to fight over?\u201d\u201cI was there. It was really intense. In the end they just threw away the ball and started fighting with their fists. Even the referees were stunned silly.\u201dThe equipment room was big and divided into sections according to the types of sport. The badminton rackets went on the innermost shelves. He Zhao lifted them up and stuffed them in, then moved to one side to make space for Xie Yu. \u201cI was at last year\u2019s basketball match.\u201dXie Yu said, \u201cOh, no wonder your class didn\u2019t make it to the finals.\u201d\u201c\u2026..\u201d\u201cClass 2 plays too dirty. No fun at all. We were eliminated in the first round.\u201d He Zhao thought back to how he had dragged the team down. \u201cCompete on skill or not at all.\u201d\u201cYeah, yeah, yeah, you\u2019re good.\u201d Xie Yu put the rackets back, straightening them somewhat obsessively, and said, \u201cYou\u2019re very good.\u201dThe space between the shelves was narrow and could barely fit two people. At some point He Zhao had moved to occupy the space opposite him, so when Xie Yu finished and turned around he was nearly in He Zhao\u2019s arms.He Zhao laughed. \u201cLittle friend, is this an offering?\u201d\u201cOffering what?\u201d Xie Yu said. \u201cA good dog doesn\u2019t block the way. Move aside?\u201dHe Zhao\u2019s hand rested on Xie Yu\u2019s waist, gently pushing through the thin fabric, nudging him into a corner. They were both tall, but the corner was secluded, and Luo Wenqiang and the others were busy chatting over by the basketballs and didn\u2019t notice them.The incident with the water bottle on the basketball court surfaced again in his mind as a result of their covert actions.\u201cI\u2019m not a dog,\u201d He Zhao said. \u201cI\u2019m not moving.\u201dThe atmosphere was just right and they had picked a good location, too. Xie Yu slowly closed his eyes and saw He Zhao\u2019s face drawing closer to his when he opened them again. He gave He Zhao\u2019s head a slap in reply. \u201cIdiot. Cameras.\u201dHe Zhao: \u201c\u2026..\u201dThere were cameras, more than one, in the equipment room. It was a lot to manage so the school relied on the students being aware the cameras were there. When equipment was borrowed and returned every class period the gym rep had to register it on a form.Xie Yu looked over and found that there was one facing them.He Zhao internally cursed ten thousand times.Luo Wenqiang and the others filled in the form, then came over. \u201cZhao-ge, are you done?\u201dAside from Luo Wenqiang\u2019s loud voice, Xie Yu could still hear He Zhao cursing under his breath. The gist was Screw young love, I\u2019m in a right and proper relationship.He Zhao kept cursing. The gym rep was nearly to their corner and He Zhao was about to let go but Xie Yu suddenly leaned forward and kissed him at the base of his ear.It was warm, and very soft.From the camera\u2019s vantage point, it would look like one of them leaned closer to say something, and one wouldn\u2019t be able to tell what they really were doing.He Zhao had been about to curse but the words got stuck and he said \u2018Fuuuuu\u2013\u2019 for very long and didn\u2019t continue.Xie Yu stepped away again, leaning back, and narrowed his eyes at He Zhao.Luo Wenqiang walked over to the equipment racks, not noticing anything out of the ordinary. \u201cDone putting the rackets back? Let\u2019s go back to class? Hao-zi and the others are waiting outside.\u201dXie Yu kicked He Zhao, who said, \u201cAh, going back to class? Then shall we go?\u201dThe mid-term exams were nearing. Class 2.3 got a lot quieter and stopped horsing around in class. Everyone was hugging the Buddha\u2019s leg,\u00b9 clinging onto the hope that cramming in these last few days would unexpectedly result in good grades.A line had formed in front of Xue Xisheng\u2019s desk to ask questions, so he had no leeway to catch Class 3\u2019s two repeat offenders.Wan Da, at the end of the line, realized he probably wouldn\u2019t get his questions answered during this class break. He sat in the empty seat in front of Xie Yu and groaned and sighed. \u201cThe two of you\u2026 even have the free time to be playing video games.\u201dXie Yu was very calm in the face of Class 3\u2019s unprecedented atmosphere of anxiety. \u201cWhat\u2019s there to review? Might as well offer incense and prayers.\u201dHe Zhao was even more calm. \u201cA few days ago, I bought a few couplets that guarantee passing the exam. They should get here before the mid-terms. A master has blessed them. Shall I give you two when they arrive?\u201dWan Da: \u201d\u2026\u2026\u201dThese two\u2026 weren\u2019t human at all.Even got goddamned couplets that had been blessed.Wan Da kept these thoughts to himself. Out loud, he said, \u201cThen\u2026 then give me two.\u201dHe Zhao\u2019s couplets arrived the day before the exam. There were ten in a packet, each with a red paper base and bold words written in gold. They looked extravagant and in one of the lower corners in small print were the words Master Ling Hui.\u00b2All of Class 3 sighed with amazement at seeing them. They all thought their creativity was too weak. To go to this extent\u2026It rained the entire day before the exam. The next morning, the roads were still damp.There was no more time to prepare. They studied all night, but didn\u2019t even have dark circles to show for their hard work of the last few days before the exams.\u201cStudents, the weather is getting cold. Remember to wear a jacket! Welcome today\u2019s exams with a warm heart.\u201d Mad Dog freely gave care and concern during his normal daily broadcast. \u201cAs the saying goes, an army will train for a thousand days for a single battle. Don\u2019t have any regrets! Fight hard, students!\u201dThey had ten minutes to move between exam rooms. Tang Sen pasted a seating chart onto the podium, and Class 3 used every last second to memorize poetry and formulas. When the bell rang, everyone picked up their writing materials and went off to their respective rooms.Xie Yu and He Zhao were still in the last division, in the exact same classroom as the monthly exams.There was basically no change to the group of people who assembled at the poor students\u2019 gathering grounds. Some students\u2019 positions were swapped, but that was all.Even if they had cheated in the previous exams, the student they had copied from was in this exam venue, too, so their grades wouldn\u2019t be much higher. Six of one, half a dozen of the other. Climbing several places from the bottom was already worthy of celebration.Xie Yu sat in his seat and He Zhao sat behind him. The two put their heads together. \u201cOld Xie, I feel like I\u2019m in good form today. I feel like I\u2019ll get a good score.\u201d\u201cKeep feeling,\u201d Xie Yu said. \u201cFeelings are all you have.\u201dHe Zhao said, \u201cSecond-from-last, you have a superiority complex?\u201dXie Yu: \u201cI\u2019m better than you, at any rate.\u201dHe Zhao lifted a hand and patted the top of Xie Yu\u2019s head.After a while, He Zhao asked, \u201cWhat do you want to eat when the exam is over?\u201d\u201cAnything\u2019s fine. Don\u2019t ask Shen Jie along.\u201d Xie Yu idly twirled a pen and said, \u201cEvery time he comes along we end up fighting.\u201dHe Zhao remembered their previous two dinner outings, slid right past the thought of reflecting on his own behavior and that of his little friend, and came straight to the conclusion that Shen Jie was the problem. \u201cAll right, let\u2019s not ask him.\u201dThe mid-term exams were much more important than the monthly exams\u2014they were a matter of life and death. After the grades were released, their parents would be waiting for them. This time, the students in the poor students\u2019 gathering ground were no longer content to copy from each other and came up with new and creative methods. \u201cI\u2019m\u2026 selling answers. Take one less beating. Anyone need them?\u201dThe others swarmed him. \u201cWhat answers? How much are you selling for?\u201d\u201cTwo hundred a set. I\u2019ll send it to your phone. Instantly.\u201d\u201cTwo hundred? Robbing a house while it\u2019s on fire,\u00b3 are you?\u201dThe student selling answers said, \u201cYeah, exactly.\u201dThe students in the poor students\u2019 gathering ground had backbone. Due to the expense, no one bought it.\u201cThe first subject is literature. Your handwriting should be neat and you must answer the questions according to guidelines. The exam duration is 120 minutes.\u201dThe invigilating teacher was Old Tang from their class and the history teacher from the class next door. If not for Old Tang, probably no one would be willing to take on the task of supervising this exam group.In the words of the other teachers, even if they copied answers, no matter who they copied from the result would still be about the same.\u201cAnalyze the question carefully, and don\u2019t stray off topic in your essay.\u201d Tang Sen fixed his gaze on He Zhao. He was really a little worried; he wanted them to do these two things right, if nothing else. \u201cAnd watch your handwriting. If we can\u2019t read it, we can\u2019t give you points.\u201dXie Yu looked at the essay question first. While he considered how to answer, he also wondered how a certain idiot would run away with the topic.The zero-point \u2018Silhouette\u2019 essay was, to this day, still circulating amongst the students in their year.Erzhong\u2019s papers were not as difficult as those of other schools. The questions were usually very conservative and followed the standard format. Xie Yu finished answering, estimated he would score about 50-60 points, then slumped on his desk to sleep.The moment he laid his head down he heard He Zhao calling him.He Zhao called his name quietly twice more, then tapped the underside of the desk with a finger. \u201cOld Xie.\u201dRain started to drizzle against the window outside. Wind blew in through the crack in the window, slightly chilly.Xie Yu remembered the monthly exams and stretched his hand out behind him. \u201cPassing answers again?\u201dHe Zhao said nothing.But the hand which Xie Yu had stuck under the desk hadn\u2019t had time to more than grasp at the air before He Zhao caught it. He grasped Xie Yu\u2019s fingertips first, then moved upwards to hold his hand.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Xie Yu\u2019s hand was cool. He Zhao said, \u201cI wanted to do this last time, too.\u201dThe rain made ripples against the glass window.After a while, Xie Yu asked, \u201cAre you done?\u201dHe Zhao said, \u201cNo.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cLet me hold on a while longer.\u201dXie Yu paused. He was speechless, but also amused. \u201cIdiot.\u201dSeeing Old Tang about to walk past them again, the idiot finally let go.Old Tang stopped in front of He Zhao\u2019s desk for several minutes, looking at He Zhao\u2019s answer paper, the creases in his forehead growing deeper and deeper. Finally, he sighed, his expression complicated as he looked at the answer sheet which was full of writing on both sides. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWhen Old Tang had gone, He Zhao poked Xie Yu with a pen. \u201cWhat was that about?\u201d\u201cZhao-ge, look downward at the answers you wrote down,\u201d Xie Yu responded. \u201cYou really don\u2019t know?\u201dXie Yu helplessly thought that this idiot probably truly wasn\u2019t aware.As a student with grades so bad even eight bulls could not pull his grades to the passing line,\u00b9 He Zhao likely even had full confidence that he had answered well.The morning exams had ended and everyone compared answers during the midday lunch break.\u201cZhao-ge, your couplets didn\u2019t work. I got many of the math questions wrong.\u201d Wan Da passed the \u2018guaranteed pass\u2019 couplets back to He Zhao. \u201cKeep them for yourself.\u201d\u201cI think they don\u2019t work, too,\u201d He Zhao said as he picked up his phone. \u201cDuring the first literature exam, Old Tang even sighed at my exam paper. I\u2019ll go ask the seller.\u201dXie Yu wasn\u2019t sure what his boyfriend was doing. \u201cAsk the seller about what?\u201d\u201cAsk him if we used it right.\u201d\u201cHow else are they to be used? Burn them and drink the ashes?\u201d\u201cSurely not that evil\u2026\u201dThe group discussed it for a while before the seller replied. \u2018If your heart is true it will work.\u2019\u2018If your heart is true it will work.\u2019 He Zhao pushed the couplets into Wan Da\u2019s hand again. \u201cShall we work on our emotions again this afternoon?\u201dXie Yu thought, Why does it seem like He Zhao is just messing with him?But Wan Da actually took the bait. \u201cAll right, I\u2019ll try again this afternoon.\u201dThe exams lasted two whole days. When the last paper was finished, everyone felt only one thing: exhaustion. To help everyone relax, Liu Cunhao put on a comedy film. The film was halfway through, the classroom still silent, when Liu Cunhao finally asked anxiously, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you laughing? Isn\u2019t it funny? Cheer up.\u201dWan Da said blandly, \u201cTurn it off. I really can\u2019t laugh. By the way, Master Ling Hui is currently the person I hate most.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to die.\u201d Luo Wenqiang slumped on his desk. \u201cI need to carefully consider my survival plan.\u201dOnly He Zhao was very obliging and enthusiastic. \u201cThis movie is good! Aren\u2019t you watching it?\u201dXie Yu went out to take a phone call.Last night, Lei\u2019s mom had asked him when his exams ended, and Dalei had immediately called after the exams.Zhou Dalei was squatting in an alley and stubbed out his cigarette when Xie Yu picked up. He switched his phone to his other hand and said, \u201cBoss Xie, you\u2019re done with exams?\u201d\u201cMm.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s get together. Aunt Mei learned some new recipes a few days ago and keeps going on about cooking them for you when you come over.\u201d Halfway through, Dalei turned and clicked his tongue at someone at his side. \u201cBastard, you\u2019re still messing around? Hold it right there. If I don\u2019t kill you today I\u2019ll write my name Lei-zai backwards.\u201d\u00b2Something didn\u2019t sound right. Xie Yu asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s up over there?\u201d\u201cNothing.\u201d Zhou Dalei walked out of the alley and the commotion grew fainter. \u201cSomeone stole something. Damn it, got the guts to steal in this neighborhood. I\u2019ll show him the power of Black Water Street when we get together.\u201dXie Yu understood. \u201cDon\u2019t hit too hard.\u201dDalei kept walking and seemed to think of something that lightened his spirits. \u201cBoss Xie, do you remember when Wang-ma got us all up in the middle of the night to chase the petty thief? Damn, that was some night. Scared me to death wondering what the hell had happened.\u201dXie Yu leaned against the wall, gazing through the window into the classroom. He felt as though he had returned to the familiar small street where the Community Environment Review score was never high.He was a little dazed.It had happened quite a few years ago. One night, in the middle of the night, a thief had broken into Wang-ma\u2019s house.The thief had crouched under the window outside, not daring to jump over the sill and into the house. He stared up atWang-ma for a long time, never having guessed that a middle-aged lady could be this powerful. Pots, pans, and dishes rained down on him and she shouted loudly enough to wake everyone who lived on her street. \u201cThief! Thief!\u201dThe petty thief also had not imagined that he would not be able to escape. He jumped down along the pipe by the side of the house, but had not even regained his footing before a slipper crashed into his face.Lei\u2019s mom, in her nightgown, took the slipper off her other foot and yelled from her balcony, \u201cOver there! I see you! Still running? I\u2019ll beat you dead.\u201dA night of chaos.They had chased the thief down three blocks.Xie Yu and the other kids had been part of the group, too, running here and there.That summer, even the night wind was warm.Before handing the thief over to the police, they trapped him against the wall where he begged for mercy. \u201cI\u2019m never coming here again.\u201d\u201cWhat are you stealing for?\u201d Aunt Mei stood right in front, rolling up her sleeves. \u201cChin up and let\u2019s talk. Don\u2019t be afraid. I won\u2019t really beat you to death. At most, half to death so I can explain something to you.\u201dMadam Gu had not assimilated very well to life on this street. Her education and values led her to not believe in beating people at the drop of a hat; they could send the thief to the police station without needing to get violent.Madam Gu had dragged him home by his ear. \u201cWhat on earth are you joining in for?\u201dXie Yu came back to himself enough to say, \u201cJust for this weekend. I didn\u2019t have anything to do, anyway.\u201d\u201cSure.\u201d Dalei generously accepted.They chatted a while longer.Xie Yu stood in the bend of the stairwell. He Zhao had slipped out of class at some point and, while no one was looking, wrapped his arms around Xie Yu\u2019s waist from behind, leaning forward to ask, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dZhou Dalei was about to hang up when he heard that on the other end of the line.The voice was very low and very close, as if right next to Boss Xie\u2019s ear. The tone lilted at the end, sounding nothing but flirtatious to his ears.The voice also sounded familiar.Zhou Dalei was shocked. \u201cWho was that? Something sounded very inappropriate there!\u201dXie Yu said, \u201cYeah, you got me.\u201dHe Zhao, who had been called inappropriate out of nowhere, said, \u201cAh?\u201d\u201cOh, you\u2019re that\u2014I remember you, we met at the station.\u201d Xie Yu gave him a quick reminder. He Zhao had a good memory and had not forgotten the experience of squatting in the police station and writing a reflection essay. He felt that he had to buddy up to his boyfriend\u2019s friend, so he thought hard and finally came up with, \u201cFriend, you wrote a good reflection essay. Brilliant style.\u201dXie Yu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dZhou Dalei\u2019s freshly lit cigarette almost fell out of his mouth. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWho on earth is this?!\u201d Zhou Dalei then thought through the words \u2018at the station\u2019 and how shameless this person was, then remembered. \u201cIs it the\u2026 the handsome devil with the mask?\u201dHe Zhao was very close to the receiver and Zhou Dalei was speaking loudly. He answered shamelessly, \u201cYes, that\u2019s me. The most handsome guy in the station.\u201dHe Zhao was a person who was easy-going by nature and could chat with anyone whether he knew them or not. Xie Yu couldn\u2019t bear to listen any more. \u201cHow shameless can you get?\u201dZhou Dalei actually did want to keep chatting with this guy. \u201cAh, Boss Xie, what a coincidence. You\u2019re in the same school? Friends?\u201dXie Yu paused, then said, \u201cMm, friends.\u201dBoyfriends, even.Zhou Dalei didn\u2019t think in that direction so Xie Yu didn\u2019t mention it, either.Although they had to be on the down-low in school, Xie Yu had no intention of keeping his relationship under wraps. If Dalei really asked about them some day, he would probably admit it. Boyfriend. Surprised?After Xie Yu hung up the phone, He Zhao asked, \u201cYou\u2019re going back home for the weekend?\u201d\u201cMm,\u201d Xie Yu said. \u201cGoing to my godmother\u2019s.\u201dHe Zhao thought about it. \u201cThe ground snake godmother you met on the streets?\u201dXie Yu hadn\u2019t thought that He Zhao would remember his offhand remark. Although Aunt Mei was a little hot-tempered and gave off the air of a mafia aunt, she was an upright businesswoman after all.The school dismissal bell rang and everyone packed up their things before trickling out of class. Grades had not even been released yet but already people were happy or worried. Liu Cunhao and the others stood in the classroom doorway and glimpsed them from afar, then waved. \u201cWe\u2019re going.\u201dOne of He Zhao\u2019s arms was resting on Xie Yu\u2019s shoulder. In this position, he waved to Liu Cunhao. \u201cBye.\u201dLiu Cunhao was no longer shocked by this scene. They had already held hands in class in public and even had a dedicated CP thread on the school forum.Xie Yu went back to his dorm room to pack his things and He Zhao followed closely behind every step of the way.He picked up several sets of clothes, then turned around, about to pick up his phone to charge, but crashed headfirst into He Zhao instead. \u201cCan you sit down somewhere quietly for a while?\u201dHe Zhao said, \u201cCan\u2019t be quiet when I think that we won\u2019t see each other for two days. 48 hours. 2880 minnutes. 172800 seconds.\u201dXie Yu was only concerned with pushing him onto the bed and didn\u2019t realize something wasn\u2019t quite right, like how quick He Zhao\u2019s mental arithmetic was.\u201cSit down.\u201d Xie Yu pushed He Zhao down onto the bed, then, holding back his anger, patted He Zhao\u2019s head and said angrily, \u201cIf you say something that stupid to me again, I\u2019ll punch you.\u201dHe Zhao: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dXie Yu didn\u2019t go straight to Black Water Street. He went to the Zhong household first.Madam Gu was currently preparing food and didn\u2019t even remove her apron before coming to the door. \u201cYou\u2019re back? Why didn\u2019t you say something?\u201dGu Xuelan asked him a few more questions\u2014something about how the cafeteria food was, if he had gotten thinner, and how the mid-term exams had gone.Xie Yu picked up an apple from a bowl of fruit and leaned against the kitchen doorway. \u201cIt went fine.\u201dThe word \u2018fine\u2019 was ambiguous, who knew what he really meant.\u201cWhat\u2019s \u2018fine?\u2019\u201d Gu Xuelan said. \u201cAre you going to be second from last place again?\u201dXie Yu said nothing and Gu Xuelan didn\u2019t press the matter, either. Inexplicably, she started talking about the last in the year. \u201cYour deskmate. The one that gets last place every time?\u201dGu Xuelan finished, then added an \u2018Aiyoh.\u2019Actually, Xie Yu sometimes felt the same way Madam Gu probably felt now.Madam Gu had originally intended to make two dishes, but now she cooked several more and was busy in the kitchen.Xie Yu sat on the sofa and waited for dinner. He looked down at his phone and typed out in the search bar, character by character, what to do when boyfriend doesn\u2019t study.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He places second to last in every exam. How can I improve his attitude toward studying?The most popular reply: How about setting a goal? For example, an improvement of a number of points or setting a target university to get into.The OP had replied, It doesn\u2019t need to be all that great. Tsinghua or Peking U is fine.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe words \u2018second to last\u2019 made Xie Yu\u2019s eye twitch, and he felt like the OP\u2019s tone was somewhat familiar.He didn\u2019t think more on it, scrolling down instead to the topics with subjects like, \u2018What to do with a child who doesn\u2019t like to study.\u2019 The parents in these threads were all anxious, resulting in the conversations eventually turning into parenting discussions.Where are you working now?State-owned enterprise. There\u2019s a lot of competition. It\u2019s tough.\u201cDinner\u2019s ready.\u201d Gu Xuelan carried the last dish from the kitchen to the dining room before removing her apron and saying, \u201cPut down your phone. Don\u2019t carry it everywhere\u2026\u201dXie Yu hit the off switch and the screen immediately darkened. \u201cGot it.\u201dFour dishes and a soup, all common home cooked dishes.Zhong Guofei ate at home if he got off work on time. He was probably out entertaining tonight, so Xie Yu and Madam Gu were the only ones at the table.Xie Yu ate a lot of every dish then put down his chopsticks to go upstairs. But Gu Xuelan was still staring at him.\u201cYou ate so little.\u201d Madam Gu always felt her son didn\u2019t eat enough. \u201cAre you full? How about another bowl of soup?\u201dEvery parent probably fed their children like they were raising pigs.Xie Yu took another bowl of red date and egg soup. When he was nearly finished, he said, \u201cMom, I\u2019m going to Aunt Mei\u2019s tomorrow.\u201dGu Xuelan\u2019s hand stilled on the soup ladle, but she did not comment further. \u201cBe careful and don\u2019t make trouble. Come back early.\u201dGu Xuelan didn\u2019t like him visiting Black Water Street so often.From her perspective, they had only lived under those conditions out of necessity and had been fortunate to meet good people. But their outlooks on life were not the same. Lei\u2019s mom and Aunt Mei showed affection through scolding and yelling, and the two even sometimes smoked together outside.Gu Xuelan had imagined that after moving away, after one or two years, or two or three, their ties to Black Water Street would fade.But Xie Yu, a child of few words who seemed to care about nothing, had developed feelings.In the evening, Xie Yu searched again for \u2018what to do if you don\u2019t like to study.\u2019 After digging through the internet, he didn\u2019t find any good ways of fostering a love for studying, but he did find a lot of questionable ways. For example, injuring one\u2019s head in a car accident or getting struck by lightning. Some were even selling quack medicine.\u2014Miracle knowledge pill! New high-tech product. Increase your intelligence, develop both the left and right brain, and easily raise your grades. No need for car accidents or lightning strikes! One thirty-day course!Xie Yu stared at it for a while, thought about He Zhao\u2019s grades, and actually considered placing an order.Xie Yu kept scrolling, looking for the pill\u2019s ingredient list. Before he could make sense of it, he received a phone call from He Zhao.He accidentally hit the speakerphone button while picking up the call and He Zhao\u2019s words rang in the air. \u201cLittle friend, what\u2019re you up to?\u201dXie Yu thought, Considering buying you a treatment plan.\u201cNothing.\u201d Xie Yu had just finished showering and his hair was still damp. Talking about the knowledge pill was definitely off the table, so he asked, \u201cWhat about you?\u201dHe Zhao said, \u201cThinking about you.\u201dHis voice was both serious and sentimental as it echoed in Xie Yu\u2019s ears.The next moment, He Zhao\u2019s hard-won EQ immediately crashed again when he said, \u201cThis is the correct answer. Remember it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Remember, my ass.Actually, He Zhao had held back for a long time already. He Zhao had wanted to call Xie Yu the moment he left. He had endured until the time he thought Xie Yu\u2019s family would probably be done eating supper.He Zhao thought of Xie Yu\u2019s stepbrother, the one who acted like a lord tyrant, and said, \u201cDid that low-IQ bully my little friend?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s not here.\u201d It took Xie Yu a moment to figure out who He Zhao was talking about. As to who was bullying who, it might even be the other way around. \u201cHe can\u2019t beat me in a fight, anyway.\u201dAll these years, Zhong Jie had never been able to take advantage of him. Not in a fist fight or in a verbal fight.The two kept chatting, on and off.\u201cRight, Old Xie. Did you mute the class group chat?\u201d\u201cNo, I check it sometimes.\u201d\u201cI thought the study rep might have driven you away. That math formula he pinned, n=c*v, has been up all day to the point I even memorized it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWhat was the use in memorizing it? That was a physics formula.Was he hoping to get formula points by writing a physics formula down on a math exam paper?Xie Yu felt helpless. \u201cThen you\u2019re doing very well.\u201dClass 3\u2019s secret group had quietly disbanded a long time ago. Since discovering that their school tyrants didn\u2019t actually beat people up, and that the teachers were all very reasonable, they didn\u2019t see the need for their own private group chat any more. It seemed contrary to team spirit.And their homeroom teacher was an old man who went to bed early and didn\u2019t hover over them.The nighttime life was for young people.Class 3\u2019s group chat was very active. The study rep changed his status every day to a different formula, and he never forgot to slip them some tidbits of knowledge even while chatting and having fun.Every time Wan Da appeared, the chat became a gossip circle\u2014you could practically see everyone\u2019s little stools and melon seeds.The classmates who participated in the group chat all had active personal lives. On the weekends, Xu Qingqing had to accompany her mother out shopping, and often vented in the class group chat while standing in the entrance of a clothing store with her arms full of bags. I! Hate! Shopping!Then Liu Cunhao and the others would console her. None of us guys like going shopping. You really are our Qing-ge.Xie Yu didn\u2019t know what to say. He was a conversation killer, and he very rarely spoke in the \u2018Don\u2019t fight\u2019 group chat, either.There was nothing to talk about, but the two still chatted late into the night. He Zhao was a seasoned jokester, and even mundane things became interesting when he spoke about them.Xie Yu was a little sleepy.Night had completely fallen and the only light in Xie Yu\u2019s room was from his phone screen, glowing softly.He Zhao heard his little friend\u2019s voice grow quieter and his replies become monosyllabic. His tone seemed soft and surprisingly obedient, and He Zhao couldn\u2019t help softening his own tone, too. \u201cYou fell asleep?\u201dThere was no response from the other side.But even through the phone, he felt their breathing entwine.He Zhao couldn\u2019t bear to hang up the phone.He was satisfied, yet somewhat dissatisfied.\u201cRecently I\u2019ve noticed\u2026\u201d Even though Xie Yu couldn\u2019t hear him, He Zhao still whispered, \u201c\u2026I might be getting addicted to being in love with you.\u201dXie Yu\u2019s thoughts were not nearly so romantically inclined.. But perhaps at night one dreams of what one thought about during the day, because that night, he dreamed about He Zhao.It was a very strange dream. He dreamt that He Zhao finished the college exams and became an excavator operator.What a nightmare.He woke up and tried to calm himself for a long time but failed.Xie Yu got up, washed his face, then couldn\u2019t keep himself from cursing at the mirror. \u201cFuck it.\u201dThe early morning bus wasn\u2019t crowded. Xie Yu put his earbuds in his ears, intending to sleep on the bus.The bus tilted from side to side, especially when making turns or when emergency braking.Xie Yu dozed for a long time, but didn\u2019t fall asleep. He was terrified that when he shut his eyes he\u2019d see He Zhao smiling at him from an excavator\u2019s cabin. He opened his eyes and saw the endless flow of traffic outside the bus window, as well as the roadside stalls selling breakfast.He got off the bus at his station, then looked down and sent Dalei a text. Had breakfast yet?Nope. Meet you at Wang-ma\u2019s?Get me five meat buns. Be right there.Wang-ma had originally opened a roadside stall selling breakfast before buying a small shop after accumulating some savings. The children here had all grown up eating her food and missed it when they couldn\u2019t have it.Xie Yu found a spot, sat down, and waited for a while before sending a text to hurry Zhou Dalei along. The moment he sent the text, he looked up to see a bowl of piping hot beancurd placed in front of him.\u201cSaw you from afar, kid.\u201d Wang-ma put down the beancurd. Her hands were still damp and she wiped them on the apron around her waist. \u201cThe buns are still steaming. Nearly done. Have this first to fill your stomach.\u201d\u201cWang-ma.\u201d The shop\u2019s condition wasn\u2019t great, and puddles of water and mud covered the floor. The shop didn\u2019t have space for all the tables and chairs, so some were placed outside. Xie Yu held the spoon, smiled, and said, \u201cI haven\u2019t ordered yet.\u201dWang-ma said, \u201cHow would I not know what you and Lei-zai want to eat? I can take your orders with my eyes closed.\u201dIn the time it took for her to say this, Dalei arrived, wearing slippers, his eyes still bleary. He scratched his head as he walked through the shop entrance, then stretched out a hand to signal. \u201cWang-ma, give me five.\u201dAunt Mei was still busy at Guang Mao and would be free around noon. Xie Yu played video games in Dalei\u2019s room all morning on a red and white Famicom console and an old tube TV they hadn\u2019t yet thrown away. \u201cYou still have this?\u201d\u201cNostalgia,\u201d Zhou Dalei said. \u201cMost importantly, it still works! I can\u2019t believe how sturdy it is.\u201dAs Xie Yu played, he recalled some things from the past, too. \u201cWhen you were small, your mom bought that\u2014what was it\u2014 for you. Did it help after you ate it?\u201dZhou Dalei scratched his head. \u201cWhat thing?\u201dXie Yu said, \u201cThe thing for improving memory and intelligence.\u201dFor the sake of Zhou Dalei\u2019s grades, Lei\u2019s mom had tried all the sketchy things, and had even made him drink couplet water. But none of it had been of any use in the end.For a while, broadcast TV had aired a commercial selling a miracle health product for children. Change their life and change their fate. Give your child a headstart in life. It had been an extended commercial lasting half an hour. Lei\u2019s mom had instantly called the sales hotline and ordered two big boxes.Zhou Dalei remembered now. \u201cOh, that. Look at me now. Does it look like it worked?\u201dXie Yu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dXie Yu thought, Yeah, that\u2019s true. I\u2019m an idiot.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

We can talk when I\u2019m done fighting.\u201dDalei\u2019s house was the same as before. Even the television set still had the same dent on top with a crack running down the screen. Just looking at it gave Xie Yu a sense of familiarity.Da Mei had broken it by accident. At the time, he had jumped from shock and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not broken, no way\u2026\u201dDa Mei had even concocted a plan to sell himself to repay the debt.But Dalei had waved a hand dismissively and said, \u201cThere\u2019s no way it\u2019s broken. Even if it was, my mom would thank you. This television has a very strong will to live. Mom has been waiting for it to break so she has an excuse to get a new one for a long time\u2026 look, it\u2019s fine, isn\u2019t it?\u201dXie Yu played for a while, then stopped. He pushed the pile of blankets on Dalei\u2019s bed into the corner, freeing up some space for himself, then sprawled with his back against the headboard and looked down at his phone where he had pulled up the class group chat.[Liu Cunhao]: I\u2019m telling you, my dad came home drunk last night. He hugged the toilet bowl, passionately called out my mom\u2019s name, and my mom nearly kicked him into it.[Wan Da]: Your dad\u2019s a lot, isn\u2019t he.[Luo Wenqiang]: Is he still alive?He Zhao had woken up early and Xie Yu had received a text from him. Before he could reply, he saw He Zhao making his presence known in the group chat.[He Zhao]: The two of you, stop messing around.[He Zhao]: Compared to Hao-zi\u2019s dad, you\u2019re worse in every way. Do you want me to recite all your heroic deeds here?Faced with the threat of blackmail, Wan Da immediately sobered up.[Wan Da]: \u2026Ha ha ha, I\u2026 I just remembered I haven\u2019t finished my homework. Friends, see you later.[Luo Wenqiang]: See you later.Xie Yu watched as the two who had said \u2018See you later\u2019 surfaced again soon after, complaining that there was too much homework.In the time they had spent idly chatting, they could probably have finished a problem set.Zhou Dalei got bored of playing video games alone and saw that his Boss Xie seemed to be in good spirits. \u201cWhat\u2019s got you so happy?\u201d\u201cGroup chat,\u201d Xie Yu explained succinctly. \u201cSomeone got drunk and thought the toilet bowl was his wife. Too much homework.\u201dZhou Dalei: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dZhou Dalei: \u201cAh.\u201dIf not for Zhou Dalei\u2019s long friendship with this young master, he wouldn\u2019t have understood what on earth Xie Yu was talking about. Xie Yu hoarded his words like gold, and his conversation partner had to fill in the blanks for himself. He told stories in a roundabout manner, too.After saying, \u201cAh,\u201d Zhou Dalei noticed that something was wrong. What was it?\u201cDamn it\u2026 your class group chat?\u201d Two minutes later, Zhou Dalei tossed away the red and white controller and jumped up.Xie Yu: \u201cWhat kind of reaction is that?\u201d\u201cA surprised reaction,\u201d Zhou Dalei said. \u201cI\u2026 I would\u2019ve never guessed.\u201dXie Yu thought about closing the chat, but He Zhao\u2019s words from last night kept echoing in his ears. About the class group chat, and about the study rep\u2026 Xie Yu hesitated for a while, then decided to leave a mark of his presence before leaving.He went through the emoji list and found a rather warm, smiling face.All the students in Class 2.3 who were online at the moment now saw in the chat window an expression that did not at all suit their youthful aesthetic sense of someone reserved, chilly, and with a mocking gaze.Xie Yu: [/Smile].[Wan Da]: \u2026\u2026[Liu Cunhao]: \u2026\u2026[Luo Wenqiang]: \u2026\u2026The chat instantly went silent.Only their Zhao-ge wasn\u2019t fazed at all.[He Zhao]: Good morning, Old Xie. Had breakfast yet?Xie Yu tapped on the screen. Before he could respond, He Zhao called. Xie Yu was still a little sleepy, and when he answered the call he said, \u201cI\u2019ve eaten. What about it?\u201dHe Zhao laughed and said, \u201cNothing. Just wanted to hear your voice.\u201d\u201cThe correct answer, again?\u201d\u201c\u2026No.\u201d He Zhao thought that his little friend might have misunderstood. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d\u201cAt the house of the one who wrote a good reflection essay.\u201d Xie Yu glanced at Zhou Dalei\u2019s bed, which resembled a dog\u2019s nest. Although he judged it a little, he hadn\u2019t had any other place to sleep. He continued, \u201c\u2026Anything else? If not, I\u2019m going back to sleep.\u201dFuck. Still going back to sleep?He Zhao connected the two thoughts and thought it rather serendipitous. \u201cWhere are you sleeping?\u201dXie Yu said, \u201cOn the bed. Where else?\u201d\u201cAh.\u201d A moment later, He Zhao said quietly, \u201cMy little friend\u2019s sleeping in some other man\u2019s bed?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Are you crazy?Zhou Dalei was still sitting on the ground, playing the video game. Xie Yu suddenly felt a little uncomfortable flirting with his boyfriend in front of his bro of many years. \u201cI\u2019m hanging up.\u201dHe Zhao had been joking. He only wanted to hear some gentle words, but now he thought it was probably better that he didn\u2019t. It was his little friend, after all, so anything was fine. \u201cMm, sleep well, then.\u201dHe Zhao hung up the phone, a lollipop in his mouth as he put his phone to one side. He glanced back down at the mock paper he was doing, read the questions, then thought about how to answer. His phone screen lit up again.It was a text.From the cutest little friend in the entire world: Other man my ass.It was only a few simple words, harshly phrased, as chilly as always. But He Zhao stared at them for a long time, and by the time he came back to his senses, he was in no mood to think about practice questions at all. He wanted to go out and run a few laps around the quad and yell at the top of his lungs.Fuck!Let\u2019s read between the lines!This is a confession!He\u2019s mine alone!Xie Yu tossed his phone aside after sending the text and slept till noon when Zhou Dalei woke him. \u201cBoss Xie, look what time it is. Lunchtime is nearly over but Aunt Mei still isn\u2019t back? I\u2019m starving.\u201dIt was bright outside. Sunlight shone in through the balcony window. Noise filtered in from the alleyway; it sounded like a couple arguing, and the whole street could hear every word.Xie Yu sat up and looked outside. A woman on the opposite balcony was eating melon seeds while listening, and every two seeds she muttered under her breath, \u201c\u2026arguing about what, exactly? Just fight it out. You\u2019ll be arguing till the cows come home.\u201dPerhaps Xie Yu had slept too much, or perhaps it was because he had been woken up, but his left eyelid kept twitching. He lifted a hand to press on it lightly. \u201cAsk her.\u201dZhou Dalei called her but no one picked up.It took several more calls before someone picked up. Xu Yanmei said that she was busy and told them to get food from a restaurant and wait until she got home that evening\u2026 then the call cut off.\u201cShe said she was busy. Probably stuff to do over at Guang Mao.\u201d Zhou Dalei stuffed his phone back in his pocket and stood up. \u201cHow about it? Shall we go out to eat?\u201dThere weren\u2019t many restaurants in the area, just a few Shaxian\u00b2 places, all empty. Aside from the shops that clearly weren\u2019t doing honest business, there were only roadside stalls to visit.\u201cLei-zai, long time no see.\u201d The shopkeeper waved warmly at the familiar face. Zhou Dalei had wanted to keep browsing, but now they couldn\u2019t not go in and eat. \u201cHave a seat. What do you want to order?\u201dZhou Dalei found a window seat, sat down, and said, \u201cTwo servings of the specialty dish, then.\u201dXie Yu picked up a pair of chopsticks. \u201cYou know him?\u201d\u201cNot well, but if you say my name in this shop you get a 20% discount,\u201d Zhou Dalei said. \u201c\u2026When the boss gets to a level in a phone game he can\u2019t beat, I help him beat it.\u201dHearing the words \u2018phone game\u2019 now made Xie Yu think of dressup games and the like\u2026 Zhou Dalei claimed that he was a pro who dared play any game that dared show its face in the app store, but he probably hadn\u2019t stepped into this realm of games before.They chatted on and off, and the smell of oil and smoke wafted from the kitchen alongside the sound of a gas stove. After about ten minutes, the boss brought out two plates of gaifan.\u00b9 \u201cTwo specials. Enjoy!\u201dAfter delivering the food, the boss walked back to the kitchen where there were two workers wearing aprons.Xie Yu had just touched his bowl and had yet to reach for his chopsticks when he heard the workers talking, their voices leaking out through the door the boss had opened. \u201cGuang Mao? I heard\u2026 yes\u2026 a fight\u2026\u201dThey were chatting when the kitchen door suddenly opened again, revealing the chilly expression of the boy who had only just now been sitting at the window seat. \u201cWhat fight?\u201dBoth of them were stunned, and recovered just enough to say, \u201cAh, a fight at\u2026 Guang Mao. Someone\u2019s causing a scene there. A whole group of them. There might be a brawl.\u201dZhou Dalei had only taken two bites of his food before a rather angry-looking Xie Yu dragged him outside by the collar. After leaving the shop, he looked extremely confused. \u201cWhat are you doing? Was there poop in the food?\u201d\u201cWhat did Aunt Mei say to you just now?\u201d Xie Yu didn\u2019t let go. \u201cWhat did she say?\u201dDown the street from here, after taking a left, was Guang Mao.Zhou Dalei also could tell something wasn\u2019t right. He recalled, \u201c\u2018I\u2019m busy right now, might be late going back.\u2019 Then nothing.\u201dNow, thinking about it, Comrade Xu Yanmei\u2019s tone had been too gentle. Before, if a delivery had been half an hour late, she would curse\u2014without repeating a single word\u2014for half an hour. But today, not only was she not angry thather precious time had been wasted, she was even very calm.Xie Yu let go. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go take a look.\u201dHe Zhao followed the route on his map application and changed buses twice before arriving at a location which looked similar to the image from a certain person\u2019s social media feed. The moment he got off the bus, he almost tripped on the road full of potholes.He Zhao had struck up a good conversation with a grandpa sitting next to him. When they got off the bus, the grandpa had even invited him to go back to his house for a chat.\u201cNext time.\u201d He Zhao was surprised at how welcoming the people here were, but he refused. \u201cI have something to do.\u201dThe grandpa kept pressing. \u201cWhat\u2019s so urgent? Let\u2019s just have a drink.\u201dHe Zhao smiled. \u201cLooking for someone. Someone very important.\u201dHe Zhao couldn\u2019t tell if he was being impulsive or not. After getting the text that morning, he had managed to hold back the urge to run laps, but he hadn\u2019t managed to restrain himself from coming over here to look for a certain someone.He wanted to see him.He really wanted to see him.But He Zhao made a few circles round the block and couldn\u2019t find his destination. Not only did he not know where his friend from the station lived, he didn\u2019t even remember his name.When Xie Yu got He Zhao\u2019s call, he was still in Guang Mao\u2019s doorway. They were on one side, facing a group of angry-looking, heavily tattooed gangsters on the other. Swords were drawn and arrows notched.He Zhao didn\u2019t have time to say anything before Xie Yu said, stick in hand, \u201cNo time right now. We can talk when I\u2019m done fighting.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Like a fistfight?\u201dXie Yu absently hummed in assent, then walked forward. The stick in his hand scraped loudly against the muddy floor.Zhou Dalei, who wasn\u2019t yet prepared to fight it out: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dXie Yu seemed to be a fight magnet. And in all the fights Zhou Dalei had been in growing up, he likely wouldn\u2019t have managed if Grandpa Xie Yu hadn\u2019t been around.Every time Xie Yu stood on smoking battlefields like this, he didn\u2019t even need to speak. Just one glance from him could rile his opponent up from the bottom of his heart: All right, you want a fight, do you? You look down on me, do you? You think I can\u2019t beat you, do you?At this point, Zhou Dalei reached out and tugged at Xie Yu. \u201cBoss Xie, at least wait until I find a weapon.\u201dXie Yu handed over the stick in his hand. He could go at it with his bare fists, anyway. \u201cNow you do.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dXie Yu was too eye-catching, and even the group staring them down couldn\u2019t help noticing that among the Guang Mao lot was a boy who looked like he was itching to start a fight. They raised their voices and started yelling. \u201cFine! We\u2019ll have it out today! Mei-jie, we usually respect you as the big sis of this place but you\u2019re getting full of yourself.\u201d\u201cWhy fucking bother talking rubbish with them?\u201d The head guy shook the ash from his cigarette, slouching as he walked. \u201cWe came here to trash the place!\u201dHaving heard everything, He Zhao\u2019s thoughts of, \u2018When I see my little friend later, I\u2019ll give him a surprise. Damn, I\u2019m a model boyfriend. When I appear in all my splendor, my little friend will be moved to death, and then we\u2019ll hold hands and walk down the street together, so romantically,\u2019 immediately shattered.He Zhao squatted on the corner of an unfamiliar street, looking at the haphazard skyline of the residential area ahead, and noticed the words Guang Mao.He thought, My little friend\u2019s violence-filled days really are exciting.Xie Yu hung up the phone, walked up, and asked quietly, \u201cWho are you and what do you do? You can\u2019t mess around on the streets like this forever.\u201dXie Yu listened to them for a while. They were spouting a load of rubbish and he didn\u2019t catch a single useful piece of information. Who knew what trivialities had made them assemble here today. He had initially listened patiently, thinking they might say something new, but they threw insults left and right, greeted eighteen generations of his ancestors, and even repeated the curses they used like a broken record. When it came down to it, they only seemed to know those few curse words.\u201cJust some riffraff. Very annoying. From North Street. I really fucking\u2026\u201d Xu Yanmei\u2019s voice was still hoarse from just having smoked a cigarette and she subconsciously reverted to cursing. She abruptly stopped herself mid-sentence and glared at Xie Yu. \u201cWhat am I doing\u2026 I should be asking you that. What are you doing? Lei-zai, you\u2019d better take him and go.\u201dZhou Dalei stood to one side and immediately said, \u201cYou think I can move him?\u201dXu Yanmei: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dSimply put, several days earlier, several truckloads of goods had arrived for Xu Yanmei. She hadn\u2019t had enough help at Guang Mao, so she had asked the supervisor to find several more people. The supervisor, being greedy, had taken a cut from the budget and then gotten workers of dubious background to do the job.After the goods had been moved, when the supervisor took stock, he found the quantities weren\u2019t right.Before he could settle the score with the temporary workers, they retaliated first. They stuck around on the ground floor of Guang Mao and refused to leave, complaining that they were good people who had been wronged and falsely accused, and demanded compensation for emotional injury.It sounded preposterous.But things like this happened here nearly every day.They weren\u2019t cultured, and order was not well-maintained here. Many people dropped out of school and would rather make a living on the street, making a few \u2018lifelong\u2019 friends and forming small gangs and sects. Although they didn\u2019t gain any traction, they still had a little power.They couldn\u2019t do menial labor for a lifetime.And yet they arrogantly fell in with gangs and thought themselves better for it.Xu Yanmei had been at a standstill with them for such a long time because she didn\u2019t want to really fight them. Perhaps she was getting on in years and growing more merciful, wanting to show mercy where she could. She had intended to scare them down, but this lot of trash was the sort who wouldn\u2019t cry until they saw their graves.While Xie Yu wasn\u2019t looking, Xu Yanmei threw away the cigarette butt she had finished smoking but couldn\u2019t bear to toss. \u201cDamn it. Can\u2019t hold back any more.\u201d\u201cTrying to get one over on me,\u201d Xu Yanmei said. \u201cAnd what psychological damage. Medical bills, on the other hand, I\u2019ll consider.\u201dXie Yu said, \u201cFight\u2019em.\u201dZhou Dalei said, \u201cGive them a proper beating and they\u2019ll be good.\u201dPassersby were now all watching the excitement. But people from around here watched on with stone-cold faces; after all, scenes like this happened every day. No one called the police. This was standard practice. People from the streets solve their problems on the streets.Xu Yanmei said, \u201cYou two can fight over my dead body! Get back, quick!\u201dThere were about a dozen people on that side and a dozen people on this side.The two groups of people hemmed and hawed for nearly half an hour. Xie Yu twisted his wrists, about to start and be done with it, but then he heard the voices around him grow several pitches higher.Xie Yu turned to look and saw a line of people walking over from the other side of the street, all carrying weapons. The one in front, leading the group, looked in high spirits.Although they didn\u2019t know what was going on, the sea of onlookers parted to give them a way through.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dXu Yanmei glanced over, too. \u201cWho is this? What are they doing?\u201dZhou Dalei kept looking, and saw something familiar. \u201cThis guy\u2026 looks a little familiar?\u201dXie Yu said nothing but cursed internally.\u201cEat some more. How does it taste? If it\u2019s good, get another bowl of rice!\u201d By the time Xie Yu had come back to his senses, he was sitting at Aunt Mei\u2019s dinner table. He poked at the rice in his bowl with his chopsticks, then watched as Comrade Xu Yanmei picked up a piece of barbecued pork, passed him by, and placed it in the bowl of the person next to him.He Zhao said thank you many times. \u201cIt tastes very good. This barbecued meat is fat but not greasy, and seasoned perfectly.\u201dAunt Mei put another piece of barbecued meat into He Zhao\u2019s bowl. She was delighted at the praise and said proudly, \u201cNo need to thank me! Don\u2019t stand on ceremony.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dXie Yu put down his chopsticks. He didn\u2019t want to talk.Zhou Dalei, on the other hand, had no such reservations. He was overjoyed. \u201cAh, just now\u2026 that was brilliant. Bro, where did you find so many people?\u201dHe Zhao said, \u201cAt the internet cafe one street over. Flash mob.\u201dZhou Dalei: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWhen He Zhao arrived at Guang Mao with his crowd, he had made a big show of defusing the situation. He was very good at putting on a show, and the ragtag lot had really taken him for a powerful street figure. Zhou Dalei had watched the whole thing with growing admiration and he was squatting on the ground, laughing so hard he clutched his stomach by the end of it all. \u201cBoss Xie, your schoolmate is really something. He\u2019s destined for greatness.\u201dXie Yu thought, Yes, the future Excavator Big Bro. Can he be anything but formidable?Aunt Mei\u2019s dining room was a small space barely cordoned off from the living room. If she was hosting many people, they would set up a big round folding table in the back garden. But they would have to check the weather report first and pick a calm and auspicious day.If Xie Yu leaned backwards, his back would touch the wall.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d He Zhao put down his chopsticks, his hand dropping below the table to touch Xie Yu\u2019s. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you eating?\u201dXie Yu took a long time to say, \u201cJust resting.\u201dXu Yanmei had a very good first impression of He Zhao. He was the first classmate Xie Yu had brought home, and he was silver-tongued and good at conversation. In the end, Zhou Dalei didn\u2019t get to eat many pieces of the barbecued pork because it all went into He Zhao\u2019s bowl.\u201cAunt Mei, don\u2019t give him any more.\u201d Xie Yu watched Aunt Mei endlessly grabbing food for He Zhao and said, \u201cHe can\u2019t eat any more.\u201dOnly now did Xu Yanmei put down the chopsticks and say thoughtfully, \u201cI do seem to have fed him a little much.\u201dIt sounded like she was feeding a pig.Having fed him, Xu Yanmei kept holding on to him. \u201cHow is our Xiao-yu doing in school? He\u2019s impulsive. If you can stop him, try to talk to him a little.\u201dXie Yu tried to convince Comrade Xu Yanmei that the few fights he had had this semester had all been with the person currently standing in front of her.He Zhao immediately said, \u201cOur Xiao-yu\u2026 no, your Xiao-yu, he\u2026 does quite well in school.\u201dXie Yu\u2019s left eyelid twitched. He had a bad premonition.As expected, the very next moment, he heard He Zhao start in on his nonsense. Something about being attentive in class, hardworking in his studies, being a team player who loved his friends and was respectful of the school rules\u2026 all these things came out.Worried He Zhao would get more and more preposterous with his praise, Xie Yu grabbed He Zhao\u2019s hand under the table.Xu Yanmei did not notice anything amiss. She felt a little embarrassed at the praise, and stepped up to mention a flaw. \u201cOur Xiao-yu\u2019s grades are a little less than ideal.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d He Zhao said. \u201cI\u2019m even less ideal than he is.\u201dXu Yanmei: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dZhou Dalei had not eaten lunch and was starving, so he was currently stuffing the leftover barbecued pork into his mouth.Xu Yanmei turned and went to the kitchen to cut some fruit. She wielded her fruit knife like a weapon, the sound of it crashing down quite terrifying.Xie Yu was still clutching He Zhao\u2019s hand and hadn\u2019t let go all this time. He rested one finger lightly on He Zhao\u2019s hand, crooking it as he asked, \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201dHe Zhao leaned close to his ear and whispered, \u201cCame looking for you.\u201dThey didn\u2019t keep talking. Their eyes met, and suddenly nothing needed to be said.Xie Yu averted his eyes, feeling his ear where He Zhao had bent to talk to him now burning up.Xu Yanmei was blustery, but the plate of fruit she made looked good. There was even an exquisite ring of walnuts arranged around the rim.He Zhao hesitantly asked, \u201cThis is\u2026?\u201dXu Yanmei dusted off her hands, walked out of the kitchen, and said bluntly, \u201cEat up. It\u2019s good for your brain.\u201dXie Yu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe Zhao: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWhen they left, their hands were both stuffed with bags of walnuts, already peeled. Enough to last them a long time. Carrying the red plastic bags, Xie Yu\u2019s feelings were complicated.He Zhao, on the other hand, seemed quite happy. This joy lasted all the way to the bus station as he walked side by side with Xie Yu and waited for the bus. He finally couldn\u2019t hold it in any more. \u201cDoes this count as meeting your family?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 80": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fake SlackersChapter 058 - You like to study, don't you.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayFake SlackersTranslator: JuryEditor: NomNomFirst Published on Chaleuria\u2014058 \u2013 You like to study, don\u2019t you.Whether it counted as meeting the parents or not, He Zhao had acted like it was. He did everything he could to gain Aunt Mei\u2019s favour, as if he, and not Xie Yu, were her godson.\u201cIt counts.\u201d Xie Yu took two steps forward. \u201cSo remember to eat all the walnuts the family gave you.\u201dHe Zhao looked down at the bags in his hands, and it kind of dimmed the joy of his prior son-in-law visit.Just now, at the dining table, they had not said much to each other, worried they\u2019d let something out of the bag. Besides, they had been focusing on their little movements under the table. So, Xie Yu only complained now. \u201cYou looked the part of a leader this afternoon, Zhao-ge.\u201dHe Zhao said, \u201cIt was all right. When I walk down the street, I feel like the whole street belongs to me.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re taking my sarcasm for sincerity?\u201dThe buses here ran every half an hour, and the previous bus had probably just left. The bus stop sign hung crooked and there were no seats in the waiting area. It looked very run-down.He Zhao hadn\u2019t noticed when he had arrived. Now he looked for a place to sit and only saw four bare stumps. He could imagine what the seat that had previously been there looked like based on the stumps. \u201cThis place really has character\u2026\u201dWhen Xie Yu had returned for summer vacation, the seat had already been like this. Zhou Dalei had even squatted on the side of the street, waiting for him.\u201cIt was stolen a while ago. Then the police found it.\u201d Xie Yu briefly summarized the theft which had made waves in the community, then paused and said, \u201cIt was probably stolen again.\u201dThe chair of the neighborhood committee was always the busiest person on the street, running herself ragged to take care of the smallest of matters in the neighborhood. Every three or five days one would see the members of the neighborhood committee wearing red armbands, yelling through megaphones, \u201cWhere\u2019s the well cover?! \u2014Which one of you stole the well cover?!\u201d\u201cWho broke the bus station sign? And the bus station seat? What are you going to do with it after sawing it off?\u201dHe Zhao was very entertained. \u201cThat really happened?\u201dBut wait, there was more.They had later discovered that the well cover had been stolen by a ruffian from the next street over. Of course, the residents of the next street weren\u2019t so altruistic as to admit it, so the people from the two neighborhoods had started quarrelling. It had gone on for so long they made the local news.He Zhao asked, \u201cThen you fought?\u201dXie Yu said, \u201cWe didn\u2019t fight. Do we look like such hooligans?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t\u2026 you?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dIt hadn\u2019t escalated into a fight, but in the middle of the night, some aunties from the Black Water Street Neighborhood Committee had gone to the next street over and stolen their well cover back.The neighboring street had never imagined such a thing would happen, and everyone was slack-jawed the next morning.Xie Yu finished his story, then noticed He Zhao was standing in a daze. He stopped and waved a hand in front of his face. \u201cHey.\u201dXie Yu waved twice, then got impatient and tried to slap him and be done with it. But He Zhao caught hold of his hand, his fingers weaving through Xie Yu\u2019s, then he said quietly, \u201c\u2026Before today, I\u2019d only seen this place in your photos.\u201dWhat He Zhao did not say was that now that he had come to visit for himself, those photos began to come alive\u2026 the animals that scurried from the grass, dirty from scuffling in the mud, the mud drying in patches on their fur as they lay, eyes closed, under the sun.Every brick, every building, and every sound from the surroundings.Now he realized where Xie Yu\u2019s contradictory yet alluring nature came from. He shut out all the evils of the world with a hard outer shell, a dry attitude that kept people at a distance.But the soft place in his heart had remained spotless.He Zhao had a lot to say, but eventually only held on to his little friend\u2019s hand and said, \u201cI think there\u2019s no hope for me.\u201dXie Yu listened to the plastic bags rustling, thought of the walnuts, and quietly thought, I think there\u2019s no hope for you, too.With a brain like his, eating walnuts would probably be of no use.They waited a while more. Half an hour went by but the bus hadn\u2019t arrived.Xie Yu wanted to know what time it was, but he had forgotten to charge his phone last night and the battery had run out. When he unlocked it, the screen barely lit up before going dark again. He nudged He Zhao with his elbow. \u201cWhere\u2019s your phone?\u201dHe Zhao said, \u201cPants pocket, left side.\u201dXie Yu\u2019s fingers came to rest on He Zhao\u2019s pocket. The material of his jeans was rough, and before he could reach in He Zhao reminded him, \u201cDon\u2019t touch anything you shouldn\u2019t.\u201dXie Yu stopped. \u201cIn your dreams.\u201d19\uff1a21.It wasn\u2019t late yet, but it wasn\u2019t early, either, and the ride back would take more than an hour.Xie Yu thought about it and decided to call Madam Gu to report in.He Zhao\u2019s home screen was very clean with only a few apps. The games folder was full, but Xie Yu only caught sight of several pink icons and a familiar-looking blob of green in the corner.Xie Yu didn\u2019t look closely. He was trying to hit the call button on the lower right corner but touched the browser icon to its left.It was a matter of privacy, after all, and Xie Yu had no intention of snooping into his partner\u2019s phone. He reacted faster than he could think, reflexively hitting the back button and returning to the main screen.But he was very sure that he had caught sight of something quite unusual on the browser page.Xie Yu hesitated a moment before opening it again.Baidu Knows: Ten must-learn kissing tips.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dXie Yu glanced up at He Zhao, who was playing with a stray cat that had popped out of the grass. He squatted by the side of the street, plastic bag in one hand, his other hand outstretched. He whistled for a while, but the cat continued to watch him warily.A while later, with no other recourse, He Zhao snapped his fingers, still squatting. The image was cool, but it scared the cat, who whined, turned tail, and squeezed back into the underbrush.\u201cWhat are you running for? I won\u2019t eat you\u2026\u201dHe Zhao was about to stand up when he noticed his little friend squatting by his side, too. He turned and asked, \u201cDone calling?\u201dXie Yu passed the phone back. \u201cNo one picked up.\u201dMadam Gu had probably gone out and left her phone at home again. He didn\u2019t like calling the Zhong household directly, since it was usually the maids who picked up and they greeted him as \u2018Second Young Master.\u2019Young master, his ass.He Zhao didn\u2019t yet know that his secret Baidu research on kissing techniques had been exposed. He took his phone back and stuffed it in his pocket. As he stood up, he heard Xie Yu calling him. \u201cHe Zhao.\u201dHe Zhao\u2019s footsteps stilled and he glanced to the side. \u201cMm?\u201dXie Yu was still squatting, but he followed He Zhao\u2019s earlier motion of inviting the cat and beckoned with a finger.He Zhao stuck one hand in his pocket, bent down, and stopped some distance from Xie Yu. He was about to ask, \u2018What does my little friend want?\u2019 when, without warning, Xie Yu caught hold of his collar and dragged him down.Xie Yu\u2019s fingers tightened, exerting strength, his knuckles whitening slightly. He Zhao was bent at the waist and nearly lost his balance. Although Xie Yu was squatting, his pull made him rise up a little, too, violently and inexorably forcing them closer.The next second\u2014Xie Yu\u2019s lips met his.He Zhao froze completely.And his heart started pounding wildly.He had researched many kissing tips, but at the critical juncture he had forgotten to close his eyes.So he saw Xie Yu\u2019s slightly upturned face and the beautiful line of his jaw. He swallowed, perhaps out of nervousness, the motion subtle and nearly unnoticeable but completely different from his usual strong presence.Xie Yu stayed there for a while, then slowly opened his eyes, too.Just like that, He Zhao forced his way into Xie Yu\u2019s line of sight.The streetlights behind them shone on the muddy ground, cutting a circle of beautiful light through the darkness.Xie Yu recalled the contents of the article he saw on He Zhao\u2019s phone, so he tentatively stuck out his tongue and touched He Zhao\u2019s tightly pursed lips, soft and wet.\u2026\u2026Xie Yu had completely forgotten the rest of the must-learn kissing tips, too. He only remembered that He Zhao\u2019s lips were very soft, and when he touched them, he went warm all over.Before Xie Yu let go, He Zhao heard him say, \u201cYou went to Baidu instead of coming to me. Zhao-ge, you like to study, don\u2019t you.\u201dThe bus was just turning the corner. The number 21 shone in red across the top, and as the bus\u2019s long body rounded the turn, it tilted heavily on the uneven, potholed road.They were both heading back to A City and had to change buses on the way. They took the same bus: 21 to the interchange where they would take separate buses.Worried that He Zhao would repeat his previous mistake of not even being able to count out thirty yuan, Xie Yu paid the fare for both of them and led the handsome devil to the very last row.Not many people took the evening bus and there were only two or three people sitting up front. The bus\u2019s interior lighting was poor, and since there weren\u2019t many people, the lights were turned off most of the time. From afar, it looked completely dark.In the corner of the back row, they were virtually unspottable.For a long time, He Zhao didn\u2019t say anything. Xie Yu was still thinking that his embarrassment period lasted quite a long time when he heard He Zhao say, \u201cFuck, I\u2019m hard.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cHappened when you licked me just now.\u201dXie Yu had still been calm up till now, but the moment He Zhao mentioned \u2018licking,\u2019 all the little details of their earlier kiss now resurfaced. He paused for a long time, then said, \u201cAsk Baidu, won\u2019t you?\u201dHe Zhao: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dXie Yu said, \u201cWhat to do if you get hard on a public bus?\u201dReality proved that there was nothing to be done. He Zhao couldn\u2019t sit next to his little friend, that was all. He crouched and moved over to the seat in front, intending to calm down on his own.They sat, one in front, one behind.The bus trundled on.When He Zhao calmed down, he cleared his throat and said, \u201cSo about that\u2026 Baidu.\u201d\u201cAccidentally saw it.\u201d Xie Yu huddled in the back seat, slightly dizzy from the bus\u2019s motion. \u201cWhat on earth do you think about every day?\u201dSince that day in the equipment room after gym class, He Zhao hadn\u2019t mentioned kissing again, and Xie Yu thought it strange that he had suddenly become so pure-hearted and chaste. He had never imagined he was planning to practice his kissing skills before approaching him again.He Zhao said nothing. He looked down at his phone and tapped away, then passed it to Xie Yu.Xie Yu reached out to take it. On the phone screen was an article Shen Jie had reblogged on QQ called The Young Man\u2019s Guide to a First Kiss, and when he reblogged it he had even mentioned his good bro He Zhao: Zhao-ge! Look! Good stuff!Some first kissers are killers. After the first kiss, your partner won\u2019t want a second one.If you don\u2019t want to become a \u2018killer,\u2019 you must follow these steps.Xie Yu was rendered thoroughly speechless. \u201cWhat the hell did Shen Jie reblog this for? Isn\u2019t he a single dog?\u201dHe Zhao said, \u201c\u2026He said it was preparation for the future.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He had even believed Shen Jie\u2019s bullshit, to say nothing of the rest\u2014to have been caught by the collar, dragged up, and kissed by his little friend like that\u2026 he would have been willing to do it a hundred times over!A moment later, He Zhao cleared his throat and said, \u201cThat\u2026 let\u2019s just forget this happened.\u201dXie Yu leaned back, the lights from the streets passing by outside falling onto his face. He couldn\u2019t help smiling. \u201cNo can do.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s too idiotic. I won\u2019t forget. Zhao-ge.\u201dHe Zhao had opened the window to let in the cool air to calm himself down, and now several strands of hair were blown up by the wind.He was very image-conscious. He would rather have his neck broken than let his hair be messy.Xie Yu watched as He Zhao took out his phone and used the front camera to check his hair. Due to the poor lighting, the image on the screen was poor quality, so he could only reach up and run his hand through it to smooth it down.Xie Yu looked on for a while, arm resting on the windowsill, and complained, \u201cNo one\u2019s looking at you anyway.\u201dHe Zhao kept running his hands through his hair, then said, \u201cA hot guy must maintain himself.\u201dMaintain. What nonsense.It was too dark in the bus and He Zhao hadn\u2019t noticed a single piece of hair still sticking up on top of his head.Xie Yu reached out, fingers winding gently into He Zhao\u2019s hair. As if stroking a cat, he patted his hair down, twice. He Zhao\u2019s hair had grown out a little. Xie Yu remembered that when they had just met, He Zhao\u2019s hair had been very short, and even a little prickly to the touch.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe Zhao froze for a moment. When he came back to his senses, he noticed that the camera app he had used to check his hair was still open, so he called out, \u201cOld Xie.\u201dXie Yu looked up at him. \u201cAh?\u201dHe Zhao hit the camera button, capturing two indistinct shadowy blobs.The image was still, but one could see from it the motion of the bus interior, the streetlights that shone in from outside, and the faint silhouettes of two people, one in front and one behind.\u201cGroup photo.\u201d After He Zhao took the photo\u2014artsy-looking, never mind that no one would understand it, anyway\u2014he made it his home screen wallpaper.The bus had stopped announcing the stops. It wound to and fro among the streets before finally slowing to a stop on some street corner and opening its front door.No one got on.The driver yelled out the door, \u201cNo one? If no one\u2019s there I\u2019m driving off. This is the last bus\u2014\u201dHe Zhao was done changing his settings. At the sound of the driver\u2019s voice, he looked up and glanced outside. He caught sight of the tchotchke store by the bus stop and thought it looked familiar.Xie Yu followed his gaze, too.\u201cI think I\u2019ve been here before.\u201d He Zhao put away his phone, got up, and sat back down in the back seat. He leaned against his little friend and enunciated, \u201cJian\u2026 Jian Xing Store. There\u2019s an internet cafe near here, if I\u2019m remembering right?\u201dThis area was not far from Black Water Street. The bus had taken many turns and hadn\u2019t gone very far as it kept circling in this area.There was indeed an internet cafe right behind the tchotchke store.Xie Yu asked, \u201cWhen were you here?\u201d\u201cSummer vacation,\u201d He Zhao said. \u201cA friend asked me over, so I came. I was bored at home.\u201d He didn\u2019t even remember where they had arranged to meet, just that he had looked for the place when he got here.The half-hour bus journey passed quickly in conversation.Before getting off the bus, He Zhao thought he might want to keep riding the bus for another couple rounds.\u201cFriend, this is the last bus.\u201d Xie Yu pushed his boyfriend off the bus. \u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201dHe Zhao stood in the doorway and said, \u201cI want to stay with you a while longer.\u201dThis time, Xie Yu didn\u2019t kick him. The bus driver, on the other hand, wanted to. The bus driver sat in his seat and waved them off. \u201cAre you two getting off or not? Why are you dawdling?\u201dXie Yu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe Zhao: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dOnce they got off the bus, the pick-up point was just around the corner. Xie Yu changed to the 3 bus, and He Zhao took the Song Ting line; they were going in opposite directions. After paying the fare, Xie Yu boarded out of habit.The bus would not set off for another few minutes and the engine rumbled as it idled.At this time of night, only a few buses were left at the interchange and several people were trickling into the pick-up point.Xie Yu leaned against the window and looked out. He saw a certain idiot get off the Song Ting line bus, not even bothering with the final step and jumping right onto the ground.Then the idiot boarded the 3 bus from the rear door and walked past the rows of seats to stand in front of him.Before Xie Yu could even say, \u201cWhat did you get on here for,\u201d He Zhao bent down and kissed him possessively. Completely different from the previous kiss and a little rushed.Brazen and unpracticed, with an uncontrollable impulse, violently drawing closer.He Zhao moved quickly. Xie Yu wasn\u2019t the only one who didn\u2019t react in time; the other passengers didn\u2019t know what this boy had rushed onto the bus in a wild hurry to do, either. They only saw them together for several seconds, then the boy stood up again and left through the rear doors.\u201cLooking for someone, not riding the bus, sorry.\u201d He Zhao waved to the driver before he left, then he turned and said to Xie Yu, \u201cI\u2019m really going this time.\u201d\u201c\u2026Get lost faster.\u201dXie Yu\u2019s words were harsh, but after the bus had travelled several stops, he lifted a hand to his ear and found that it was still burning.The weekend passed quickly, and amidst the anguished complaints of \u2018I don\u2019t want to go back to school and get my grades\u2019 in Class 3\u2019s group chat, Sunday was about to come to an end.Xie Yu packed his things and glanced at the class group chat before he went to bed.[Liu Cunhao]: Why did the weekend pass so quickly? I haven\u2019t fully enjoyed my last two days alive on earth.[Wan Da]: And our teachers are so hardworking, too. They even brought our papers home to grade. Did you see Old Tang\u2019s text? He said grades would be out by Monday. Hao-zi, have you decided where you want to be buried after you\u2019re dead? I want my ashes to be scattered over the sea. Facing the ocean, where the springtime is warm and the flowers blossom.[Liu Cunhao]: I prefer burial. Dust returns to dust and dirt returns to dirt.[Xu Qingqing]: You\u2019re all sick, right? It\u2019s just a midterm exam.[v-=abc]: It\u2019s never too late to study. One failure doesn\u2019t count for anything. The important thing is to correct your attitude towards studying.[Luo Wenqiang]: Study rep, new formula again?After a while, He Zhao popped into the group chat, too.[He Zhao]: Quickly? What?[He Zhao]: I think these two days have passed so slowly.[Luo Wenqiang]: \u2026\u2026[Wan Da]: This isn\u2019t like you, Zhao-ge.[Liu Cunhao]: Zhao-ge, you\u2019re tired of living?Their Zhao-ge not only didn\u2019t look like he was tired of living, he even went against character and arrived in the classroom bright and early the next morning.\u201cYou\u2019re very early today.\u201d Liu Cunhao was on duty today and had to arrive early to face his terrible fate. \u201cSo early it\u2019s even a bit weird.\u201dHe Zhao looked up and smiled. \u201cYou say it like I\u2019m late every day.\u201dLiu Cunhao was shocked. He was about to say, \u2018Aren\u2019t you?\u2019 but decided not to. He shook his head, then took the washcloth to the bathroom to wash.Xie Yu had gone to the breakfast place outside school and gotten a cup of soymilk before coming to class. As he paid, he saw Mad Dog and Old Tang having breakfast in the shop. Holding his drink, he couldn\u2019t bring himself to leave just like that. \u201cDean Jiang, Mr. Tang.\u201dOld Tang nodded at him, swallowed his food, then waved him over. \u201cYou\u2019re just drinking soymilk? Is that filling? Come, sit down and eat a bun.\u201d\u201cNo need. I\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s this about no need? Come over.\u201d Mad Dog dragged out the plastic stool next to him, thoroughly demonstrating the principle of \u2018abuse of power.\u2019 \u201cOr else you\u2019re barred from school.\u201dXie Yu held onto the meat bun, listening to Dean Jiang complain about the school cafeteria food. \u201cWhat meat buns? Three bites in, there\u2019s still no meat.\u201dOld Tang nodded. \u201cThe first time I ate there I thought there wasn\u2019t any filling at all.\u201dDean Jiang said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t taste good, either.\u201dXie Yu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dOutside school, Dean Jiang was quite reasonable. Even if this place was only one block away from school.He was different from the DJ Jiang who broadcast over the intercom and different from the Mad Dog who was the headache of every student in Liyang Erzhong.He was very ordinary.He was so ordinary it seemed that it was only the burden on his shoulders and the title of \u2018teacher\u2019 that made him formidable.When Xie Yu arrived at class, almost everyone had arrived. Wan Da rushed in from the faculty office all agog. \u201cGood news! The papers aren\u2019t done being graded! Not! Done! Grading! We can live one more day, brothers!\u201dLiu Cunhao tossed aside the washcloth and hearily embraced Wan Da on the podium. \u201cMy good brother, we\u2019ll have a good meal this afternoon. We must go out in a blaze of glory.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s all this,\u201d Xie Yu said as he entered through the back door. He sat down and said, \u201cAbout living or dying.\u201dHe Zhao had watched the ruckus all morning and his deskmate had finally arrived. \u201cMidterms. They\u2019ve even written their last wills and testaments. Something about \u2018if I am unfortunately beaten to death by my mother\u2026\u2019 can\u2019t remember the rest, but that\u2019s the gist.\u201dThe image of their classmates writing a will bright and early in the morning was too beautiful and Xie Yu thought that, in comparison, eating meat buns with Dean Jiang wasn\u2019t much.On the topic of food, Xie Yu remembered something else important.He Zhao heard his boyfriend, whom he had been mooning over all weekend, now say a second thing to him in the space of less than a minute since they had seen each other again. \u201cDid you eat the walnuts?\u201dWan Da\u2019s hearsay was not always accurate. He heard that the papers hadn\u2019t been graded, but he hadn\u2019t heard all of it. Only some classes\u2019 exam papers hadn\u2019t been graded, and Class 3 was not among those classes.So, when Wu Zheng carried a stack of exam papers into class, the whole classroom went quiet.He Zhao was quite happy. \u201cOld Xie, look. I actually got this question right.\u201dXie Yu thought, I don\u2019t really want to look.\u201cDidn\u2019t believe it, did you? These few papers\u2026 I finished grading them on Saturday.\u201d Wu Zheng picked several pieces of chalk out of the box and said, \u201cLook at what you got. Wan Da, what are you closing your eyes for? Eyes opened or closed, you scored eighty points\u2026 Look at how happy He Zhao is. He scored thirty points, but to him it\u2019s thirty points of happiness.\u201dWan Da: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But in all of Wu Zheng\u2019s years of teaching, he had never met a student like He Zhao before. Even though he had gotten \u2018worrying\u2019 grades, he situated himself in the \u2018happy\u2019 camp of his own accord.Wu Zheng was very impressed. A true talent.Impressed to the point that he couldn\u2019t keep himself from throwing chalk pieces one after the other at the back row, saying as he did so, \u201cHe Zhao, your psychological constitution is very strong\u2026 I can\u2019t find any stronger across all three class years at this school.\u201cHigh praise, high praise.\u201d Watching the chalk fly in his direction, He Zhao smiled and said, \u201cI\u2019m just averagely good.\u201d\u201c\u2014You really think I\u2019m praising you?!\u201dOne of the chalk pieces had missed its mark. It landed on Xie Yu\u2019s side of the desk with a clatter before rolling to the floor.Xie Yu, for his part, was worrying about his boyfriend scoring badly on exams and really becoming an excavator operator in the future. Hearing this, he propped his head up on his hands and smiled. \u201c\u2026Idiot.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d Wu Zheng, seeing that they\u2019d had their fun and the class\u2019s spirits had been lifted, gestured for them to quiet down and started going through the exam paper. \u201cOne exam doesn\u2019t count for much. These questions weren\u2019t that difficult, so why was the class average so low? I went over the questions where you lost points\u2026\u201dExam paper in hand, Wu Zheng copied the questions onto the board and lifted his hand to reveal a perfectly drawn cube.Xie Yu glanced down and put his 40-point math paper under his desk. He had nothing to do, so he slumped onto his desk and prepared to nap for a while.The moment he lay down, his deskmate with the strong psychological constitution poked his wrist twice with a pen.Xie Yu moved his head slowly, pillowing his head on his arm as he turned to face He Zhao.He Zhao was also slumped onto the desk in a similar fashion. They maintained this position for a few minutes, just looking at each other.There was silence between them, neither of them saying a word, but as their gazes met something in Xie Yu\u2019s heart began to sink.He Zhao had his back to the sun, the picture of leisure, the corner of his mouth quirking up gently.Xie Yu watched him for a while, then moved first. He reached out and pulled the zipper of He Zhao\u2019s jacket up properly. \u201cGe, who do you think you\u2019re seducing?\u201d\u201cI wouldn\u2019t dare.\u201d He Zhao looked down at Xie Yu\u2019s hand still resting on his jacket; who knew his little friend was so possessive. He smiled and said, \u201cFor your eyes only.\u201dClass 3\u2019s average was still the same. The first in the year\u2014first from the bottom, that is.The top scorers were Xue Xisheng and Xu Qingqing, but their scores didn\u2019t do much for the average.The literature essay question had been an analysis essay. During lunch, the class rep brought the literature essays over from the faculty office and was immediately swarmed by students, but none of them were looking for their own paper. \u201c\u2026Where is Zhao-ge\u2019s essay? Our fount of happiness.\u201dXie Yu had just woken up and glanced up on hearing this. He Zhao was standing at the podium, protecting his exam paper. The scene at the podium was messy and several exam papers had fallen on the ground and been stepped on.Then Luo Wenqiang and Liu Cunhao each caught hold of one of He Zhao\u2019s arms and frogmarched him away, calling back to their classmates, \u201cQuick, find it!\u201dHe Zhao didn\u2019t get violent with them and was marched straight out of the classroom. He stood in the doorway, unsure whether he should laugh or cry. \u201cYou\u2019re too much, aren\u2019t you? Can you leave a fellow human being some dignity? What\u2019s so interesting about a zero-point essay?\u201dFor an analysis essay, even going off on a tangent so wide it veered away from Earth would not produce anything as ridiculous as, \u2018My silhouette is very suave.\u2019 But He Zhao\u2019s analysis and evidence all had nothing to do with the topic, and the way he forced them all together was an impressive sight to behold, too.The paper made its rounds and was returned before the next class began. Wan Da didn\u2019t dare hand it back to He Zhao directly and tossed it on Xie Yu\u2019s side of the desk instead, laughing so much his stomach hurt. \u201cImpressive, impressive. Very impressive. I\u2019ve witnessed the legend of someone talking like a blind person while his eyes are wide open.\u201dXie Yu glanced at the essay and thought that it was much better than the Silhouette essay. \u201cYou\u2019ve improved, ge.\u201dHe Zhao asked, \u201cReally?\u201dXie Yu\u2019s grip tightened on the pen in his hand and he succinctly opined, \u201cThe contents of the analysis aside, at least you knew you had to write an analysis essay.\u201dThe first two paragraphs had been all right, although Xie Yu couldn\u2019t tell how they were related to the topic at all. Xie Yu had considered praising him as a form of encouragement, but as he continued reading he caught sight of the line, \u2018He Zhaovsky once said\u2026\u2019Xie Yu was silent for a while before folding up the exam paper and handing it to He Zhao. \u201cI was lying. Take it and get lost. You deserve zero points.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAlmost every class period was spent reviewing the exam papers and everyone had sunk into a stupor by the last class of the day. The day passed like a dream and for a moment no one realized school had let out when the class dismissal bell rang.Only when He Zhao stood up and called out, \u201cOld Xie, let\u2019s go eat,\u201d did the other students come back to their senses, pack up their belongings, and trickle out of the classroom. \u201cAh, let\u2019s go, let\u2019s go. Let\u2019s go home and receive our beatings.\u201dLiu Cunhao sighed sorrowfully. \u201cSuddenly, I think living in the dorms is very good\u2026 you can live four days longer.\u201dXie Yu stood up and said, \u201cYou should seize the moment. Look up which crematoriums are good and which are reliable.\u201dLiu Cunhao: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe Zhao and Xie Yu both left school to get dinner. At the school gates, they discovered that the restaurants had come up with a new marketing strategy. A banner even hung atop the signboard of the Valedictorian House, a blinding bright red, drifting in the wind: Congratulations to Erzhong Students on your Midterms! 20% Storewide Discount! Welcome new and returning customers!\u201cThey don\u2019t understand the exams at all,\u201d He Zhao said, shaking his head. \u201cDid you see how slowly Hao-zi packed up his things? He really wanted to stay behind for evening self-study with us.\u201d\u201cI saw. He looked like he was about to die,\u201d Xie Yu said. \u201cHe still hasn\u2019t left?\u201dHe Zhao pulled out his phone. \u201cProbably not. He\u2019s still in class, picking crematoriums maybe? Wait\u2026 I\u2019ll send him a photo.\u201dLiu Cunhao had finally plucked up the courage to leave the classroom but he broke down when he got the photo. These two big bros\u2026 one was cold and the other was mean, and both were intent on giving him a hard time.Wan Da, on the other hand, threaded his needles properly. He hit the voice recording button and yelled, \u201c\u2014Zhao-ge, get me some milk tea!\u201dParents surrounded the school gates and the air was full with the honking of cars. It was too noisy and Wan Da\u2019s voice wasn\u2019t clear, so He Zhao listened twice and still wasn\u2019t able to decipher it. \u201cWhat tea?\u201dXie Yu couldn\u2019t hear, either, but he could take a guess. \u201cMilk tea, probably.\u201dJust as Xie Yu had never imagined that one day he would have a meal in the Gold List Restaurant, he had never imagined he would stand in line in front of the Fudan Milk Tea Shop, either.\u201cBoyfriend, let\u2019s talk about this.\u201d Xie Yu stood beside He Zhao, a group of girls around them glancing their way from time to time. \u201cYou buy it. I\u2019ll go back first.\u201dHe Zhao had the order form in one hand and Xie Yu\u2019s wrist in the other. He pulled Xie Yu back. \u201cDo you have a conscience or not? You\u2019re really leaving?\u201dXie Yu had really been going to leave, but at that very moment the group of girls behind them took action and pushed the girl in the middle forward. She was quite pretty and took two tentative steps in their direction before walking up to them. \u201cHi\u2026\u201dXie Yu\u2019s eyebrow twitched and he stood still.The girl looked directly at He Zhao as she spoke, but when he met her gaze, she averted her eyes shyly. Her intentions were very clear.Xie Yu thought, thank goodness He Zhao lives at school and doesn\u2019t run around outside all day\u2026Then he heard He Zhao apologizing to the girl. \u201cSorry, you can\u2019t cut in line.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dIt went silent for several minutes, so quiet you could hear a pin drop.It was their turn in line. The girl stood in front of them, stiff-backed, blocking the entrance.The milk tea shop employee shouted through the tense atmosphere, \u201cNumber 18, one Fudan milk tea.\u201dHe Zhao handed over his receipt very casually. \u201cHere.\u201dIf Shen Jie were here, he would definitely tell the \u2018Not scanning\u2019 story again. Embarrassment on repeat.He Zhao carried the milk tea back to school. After two flights of stairs, he discovered that his little friend had fallen behind, so he waited on the landing. \u201cWhat\u2019s on your mind?\u201dXie Yu said casually, \u201cWondering how you got a boyfriend.\u201dOn the way back, He Zhao had thought about it, too. He scratched his head and said, \u201cSometimes I\u2019m quite\u2026 Shen Jie told me a few times, too.\u201dNot scanning and not cutting in line aside\u2026 In junior high, a girl had told him she wanted to be friends. Out of shyness, she hadn\u2019t said \u2018boyfriend and girlfriend\u2019 and only hinted at what she wanted with ambiguous comments. He Zhao hadn\u2019t understood and had replied, \u201cAll right, we\u2019re bros from now on.\u201dThe girl had cried on the spot before he realized what kind of \u2018friends\u2019 she had meant.There were two lights in the stairwell. He Zhao paused, then said, \u201cBut you\u2019re not the same, because I like you so much that\u2026 no matter how oblivious\u2026\u201dNo matter how oblivious he was, he could not overlook it.He Zhao didn\u2019t finish; even he felt that it was too sappy to say, especially in a public place. He stopped mid-sentence, stood up, and walked in the direction of the classroom. \u201cLet\u2019s go. Wan Da is waiting\u2026\u201dHe didn\u2019t finish, but even an idiot could tell what he meant.He Zhao had just turned around when Xie Yu said from behind, \u201cZhao-ge, can I kiss you?\u201dHe Zhao nearly tripped.After school hours, the classroom building was nearly deserted. Throughout their long conversation in the stairwell, they hadn\u2019t met a single person.He Zhao dragged Xie Yu up the stairs, then turned left and pushed open the door of the classroom nearest the stairwell.Xie Yu only caught a glimpse of the empty, unfamiliar classroom before the world turned upside down around him. By the time he had recovered, He Zhao had pushed him up against the wall.The door was wide open and both of them were stuck in the small space between the door and the wall.\u201cThis is thrilling.\u201d Xie Yu bent close to He Zhao\u2019s ear and asked, \u201cHere, then?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d He Zhao hung his head and said, \u201cHere\u2019s not the best place, but I couldn\u2019t wait any more.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When they came back to their senses, one of He Zhao\u2019s hands was resting on Xie Yu\u2019s waist and he couldn\u2019t help pulling him closer.His masculine frame was solid and his temper was harsh, but other places were unbelievably soft.Xie Yu was kissed so much he couldn\u2019t speak and could only push at He Zhao weakly. He cursed, his words hoarse and his tone dropping at the end: not forceful at all. \u201cHe Zhao, were you born in the year of the dog?\u201dThe space behind the door was not large enough for two people, and certainly not two tall boys.He Zhao drew closer and closer, closing the distance between them by half. Xie Yu almost couldn\u2019t breathe, his back hurting where it pressed up against the wall.A kiss, so be it\u2014but he liked biting, too.Xie Yu felt a faint pain at the corner of his mouth\u2014He Zhao had probably broken skin.This sort of thing, hiding from everyone to kiss in an empty classroom, felt quite taboo and very audacious.After making out for a while Xie Yu wanted to let go, but when their gazes met, they both saw the other trying very hard to regain a hold of the emotions they had long lost control of and couldn\u2019t suppress any more.\u201cJust a while longer.\u201d He Zhao pulled Xie Yu back again, leaned down, and touched Xie Yu\u2019s nose with his lips. \u201cI haven\u2019t kissed you enough.\u201dHow could he possibly have gotten enough? When he saw how his little friend\u2019s eyes clouded over at his kisses, he didn\u2019t want to let go.\u201cYou call that kissing?\u201d\u201cMy skills could be improved.\u201d He Zhao\u2019s lips moved several centimeters lower, landing on the corner of Xie Yu\u2019s mouth. \u201c\u2026Need to practice.\u201dHe Zhao\u2019s voice dropped and his breath fell onto Xie Yu\u2019s ears very invitingly as he coaxed his little friend. They were dangerously close and Xie Yu nearly lost control.Just then, footsteps came from the far end of the corridor, followed by a voice that seemed to be drawing closer. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t this classroom door shut?\u201dThe student council was spot-checking classrooms for cleanliness.Aside from classes, Erzhong also held many other activities. To enrich students\u2019 extracurricular lives, the student council not only had to regularly check that the classrooms were clean, they also had to organize poetry reading contests, debate competitions, and so on and so forth\u2026 wherever they were needed, they would go.Xie Yu stared at He Zhao\u2019s face inches from his own and thought they had landed themselves in a thorny situation.\u201cShall we just run out?\u201d\u201cJump out the window.\u201d He Zhao had no confidence, either, even though he had done much more ridiculous things before. \u201cIt\u2019s cooler?\u201dThe student council members dawdled by the door with their checklists for a long time but didn\u2019t enter. \u201cIt looks clean enough. Maybe the student on duty hasn\u2019t left yet\u2026 let\u2019s continue on for now and see.\u201dA terrifying situation but there was no real danger.Wan Da was in the classroom, doing homework as he waited for He Zhao to bring him his milk tea. He had already finished his homework for one subject but his milk tea still had not arrived. \u201cWhat\u2019s taking so long? If I went out and bought some I\u2019d have come back twice over already.\u201d\u201cYou mean Zhao-ge? Surely not.\u201d Xu Qingqing walked in holding a cup of tea. \u201cI saw them when I went out just now. They should\u2019ve been back long ago.\u201dWan Da was worried. Waiting for this cup of milk tea was just as anxiety-inducing as waiting for someone who would never arrive.By the time He Zhao appeared in the classroom doorway, Wan Da nearly flung away his pen and jumped him. \u201c\u2014I\u2019ve waited so long even flowers would have wilted, big bros. I nearly thought you weren\u2019t coming back for evening self-study.\u201d\u201cWe\u2026 had an accident.\u201d He Zhao put the milk tea on Wan Da\u2019s desk and asked, \u201cDid Hao-zi leave?\u201dThe milk tea was still warm. Wan Da inserted the straw and drank two mouthfuls, satisfied. \u201cHe left. Old Tang came over to talk to him and covered everything from a student\u2019s exam attitude to how to calmly face failure. He talked for over half an hour and still wasn\u2019t done, so Hao-zi packed up his things and left through the back door.\u201dIt was very much their homeroom teacher\u2019s style of doing things. He Zhao said, \u201cOld Tang\u2019s the most impressive after all.\u201dWan Da finished, then noticed Xie Yu walking in through the rear door and stopped mid-drink. \u201cYou\u2026 fought?\u201dHe Zhao was about to ask, \u2018What fight?\u2019 Why would he bring up fighting, out of nowhere?Wan Da continued, \u201cWhy is Yu-ge\u2019s mouth injured?\u201dXie Yu had just arrived in the doorway and Wan Da\u2019s eyes were sharp. Although he faintly felt that the wound wasn\u2019t quite right, his thoughts stuck fast on \u2018fight.\u2019 \u201cWho was it? Who dares to provoke Erzhong\u2019s Big Bro of the West?\u201dHe Zhao coughed.Wan Da could not miss out on this thrilling and exciting gossip. He went on for a while, hoping one of them would join in and back up his story, but no one bothered with him.Xie Yu touched the corner of his mouth with a finger, passed Wan Da by, and walked to his seat.\u201cDrink your milk tea.\u201d He Zhao kicked Wan Da\u2019s desk leg and said meaningfully, \u201cKids shouldn\u2019t poke their nose into grownups\u2019 affairs.\u201dWan Da thought, What was that? About kids and grownups?He bit on his straw, planning to do his chemistry homework next. Then he couldn\u2019t find his textbook among the study materials on his desk, so he turned around, still holding his milk tea, to look in his bag. The moment he turned around he saw the two big bros in the last row doing things as if no one was watching.Xie Yu had been looking down at his phone at a holiday greeting from Aunt Mei\u2019s but he had only read half her text when He Zhao forcefully caught hold of his chin and lifted it.He Zhao moved closer and said, \u201cDon\u2019t move. Let me look.\u201dThe wound on Xie Yu\u2019s mouth stood out against his pale skin.Aside from worrying someone would figure out how he got injured, Xie Yu wasn\u2019t concerned about it. He just wanted to reply to the text, so he retorted without even thinking about it. \u201cNot a problem. I can take it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dDuring evening self-study, Old Tang brought a book with him to read as he observed class.Near dismissal time, Xu Qingqing and the others had finished their work and had nothing to do, so they started chatting with Old Tang. \u201cTeach, I heard you used to teach at the Experimental High School?\u201dOld Tang stuck his bookmark into his book then looked up. \u201cYou\u2019re done with homework?\u201d\u201cNearly.\u201d Wan Da nudged his chair forward and himself with it, curious. \u201cMr. Tang, how did you come to Erzhong to teach?\u201dPeople had been curious about this ever since Tang Sen had accepted the job of being Class 3\u2019s homeroom teacher. The Experimental High School was among A City\u2019s premier schools and even several Erzhongs combined could not compare to it.Xie Yu didn\u2019t listen closely to what Old Tang said in reply, his classmates\u2019 questions changed every three minutes, anyway. \u201cMr. Tang, when are we taking our fall class trip? Soon?\u201dThere were only ten or so live-in students and Old Tang made them all sit close to the front, so Xie Yu and He Zhao both sat in the column closest to the window where they listened to the chat about the fall class trip.\u201cAll of you only think about playing. Why aren\u2019t you as attentive in class?\u201d Old Tang started lecturing, but after his lecture was done he told them what they wanted to know anyway and said, \u201cThe fall class trip will probably be this week, tentatively Friday, but we\u2019re not yet sure about the timing\u2026 don\u2019t share this with the other classes. Dean Jiang didn\u2019t want me to tell you early because we don\u2019t want you to\u2026\u201dBefore he had even finished, the class was already in an uproar. \u201cClass trip! Friday! Class trip!\u201dOld Tang: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe Zhao, hearing this, grew excited, too. He closed out of his video game and asked, \u201cAre you going on the class trip?\u201dXie Yu always skipped school on class trip days. With a calm expression, without even a cough, he told the teacher he had a fever. The teachers had never quite said anything, either, as if a problem student like him not going would end up saving them some trouble.Now that he thought about it, he hadn\u2019t participated in any class trips or any other sort of outing since entering high school. \u201c\u2026Where do people usually go?\u201dHe Zhao said, \u201cIt\u2019s quite boring. Classic locations that never go out of style. A public park, a theme park, or a museum. It can\u2019t be anything but these three locations. If the school plans well, we might get to go hiking on a mountain.\u201dLast year, for some inexplicable reason, the school had taken them to the park. The flowers had all already wilted, leaving only bare tree trunks and branches. They had walked all day and not seen anything, and in the cold wind they had felt only dreariness and desolation.Xie Yu felt he had been very wise to take the day off. \u201cIt\u2019s boring, but you\u2019re still going?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not boring if you\u2019re around.\u201d He Zhao slumped on the desk, looking at him, then asked again, \u201cAre you going?\u201dXu Qingqing and the others were already discussing what to bring. \u201cTomorrow after school I\u2019ll go out and buy some snacks and some cards. Ah, does anyone want to play truth or dare?\u201dWan Da raised both hands in the air. \u201cYes, yes, yes! I\u2019ll vote for Hao-zi, too. We\u2019ll both be there.\u201dThe way they were acting, one might think the midterms had been last month. After a while, Xie Yu said, \u201cI\u2019ll think about it.\u201dHis little friend was stubborn. \u2018I\u2019ll think about it\u2019 meant yes.The news of the class trip spread like wildfire in class the next morning. Even Liu Cunhao, who had taken a beating when he went home, now grew happy. \u201cThis Friday?!\u201dWan Da high-fived him. \u201cSurprised? Happy?!\u201dYesterday, Liu Cunhao had still been hugging Wan Da and crying, and at lunchtime he had even said he was too sad about his bad grades to eat anything. He had been forcibly dragged to the cafeteria and had ended up gobbling down two bowls of rice after saying he couldn\u2019t eat.Seventeen was a very innocent age.Xie Yu was planning to catch up on sleep, but even though it was so noisy he couldn\u2019t sleep, he didn\u2019t feel frustrated.He listened quietly for a while, then opened his eyes and saw He Zhao with his left leg haphazardly propped up on his right kneecap as he mimicked Liu Cunhao\u2019s death-throe groans from yesterday. \u201cWhat shall I do? I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll live past today\u2026 no, I really can\u2019t eat anything.\u201dLiu Cunhao pointed to He Zhao and said, \u201cZhao-ge, although I can\u2019t beat you in a fight, it\u2019s not right to mock people like that.\u201dThe class grew rowdy again.Xu Qingqing and the others had come to a decision. When the class dismissal bell rang, a group of four or five waved to them. \u201cZhao-ge, are you both coming? We\u2019re taking the bus to the shopping center to get some snacks.\u201dNear the school there was only a small convenience store, and even if they weren\u2019t picky, they wouldn\u2019t be able to get spicy dry noodles for the class trip.The closest supermarket was two stops away and, if they were quick, they would get back to school before evening self-study period began.They got off the bus and everyone dispersed to get their own things.Xie Yu leaned against the side of the shopping cart, watching He Zhao examine the best-by dates on the snacks, and thought for the first time that He Zhao actually seemed quite domestic at heart.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Xie Yu thought this feeling was rather serendipitous. From time to time He Zhao asked whether he would eat this, whether he wanted that, and for no reason at all Xie Yu thought of the words \u2018daily life.\u2019They were still wearing Erzhong uniforms so they had to be discreet when holding hands and could only do so when no one was around.\u201cWill you eat this?\u201d He Zhao was standing close and from afar they just looked like two boys talking. \u201cNew flavor. Wanna try it?\u201dXie Yu glanced at the packaging: green pepper flavor. \u201cIf you want to die, I won\u2019t stop you.\u201d\u201cIt should be fine.\u201d He Zhao liked to buy food he had never eaten before. There was a novelty to it, even if it was the sort of food no one would touch were he to serve it. \u201cI bought the mustard flavor last time. It was all right. But when Shen Jie took the rest and ate it he nearly threw up.\u201dSnacks could not make a meal, so they picked only a few. The surroundings grew noisy and Xie Yu tried to let go of He Zhao\u2019s hand, but even after pulling for a while He Zhao still did not let go.\u201cPeople are around.\u201d\u201cWhere? There\u2019s no one around.\u201dHe Zhao was very adamant, but the moment the words left his mouth someone tugged at his pants leg. He glanced down: a little girl had come out of nowhere. Her hair was tied into two braids and she was about four or five years old. She said meekly, \u201cGege.\u201dHe Zhao: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWhere had she come from? And so silently.\u201cGege, I want that one.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe girl\u2019s plump fingers pointed to a shelf, her words slightly mispronounced. \u201cStrawberry flavor.\u201dXie Yu followed with his eyes: it was a bag of popsicles, a cartoon figure printed on the packaging. The shelf was high and this little bean wouldn\u2019t be able to reach it even if she jumped.\u201cGet it for her, gege.\u201d Xie Yu took two steps forward and said, \u201cStrawberry flavor.\u201dThe strawberry flavored ones were right inside. He Zhao pushed the other bags to the side for the time being, holding them in place with one hand for fear they would fall. Xie Yu calling him \u2018gege\u2019 made him almost drop them.Xie Yu\u2019s voice was cool and his words were usually sharp, so when he was gentle it was especially inviting.The little girl was still staring at the popsicles, the want almost flowing out of her eyes. He Zhao pulled the bag out, put the others back, then said to Xie Yu, \u201cJust you wait.\u201dThe bag of popsicles wasn\u2019t big but the little girl still needed both hands to hold it. She said, \u201cThank you, gege.\u201dAfter He Zhao had gotten her the popsicles, he squatted and started talking to her. \u201cYou\u2019re alone? Children shouldn\u2019t run about.\u201d\u201cMom is over there.\u201d The little girl pointed to a woman weighing some sweets, who had long hair and seemed gentle. After pointing, the little girl called out to her mother, then waved to them. \u201c\u2026Bye, gege.\u201dHe Zhao patted her head, then fumbled in his pockets for a while, pulled out a sweet, and gave it to her. He smiled and said, \u201cBye.\u201dIt was a very ordinary scene but Xie Yu thought that a boy like this\u2014audacious and daring\u2014was so warm when he folded up all his edges and was gentle, it made Xie Yu\u2019s mind go blank.By the time the little girl left, they were nearly done shopping. They just had to go over to the drinks section to get some water, and that would do for their trip supplies.The shopping mall was small, just two floors, and not very crowded. They had easily walked around more than half of it.\u201cWhat did you call me just now?\u201d He Zhao pressed close to Xie Yu\u2019s ear and asked.Xie Yu pushed the cart and leaned to one side. \u201cYou\u2019re settling the score with me?\u201dBefore He Zhao could reply, Xu Qingqing and the others walked up to them, their carts nearly colliding. \u201cAre you done shopping?\u201dWan Da\u2019s cart was full of snacks. He had gotten four bags of chips alone. Xu Qingqing, on the other hand, had gotten many sweet things and many kinds of desserts.Xie Yu said, \u201cNo.\u201dHe Zhao added, \u201cStill need two bottles of water.\u201dWan Da looked down at his own cart, then said, \u201cI need drinks, too. All right, let\u2019s go together.\u201dThe drinks section consisted of two full shelves. Wan Da pushed his cart, looking around, and couldn\u2019t decide between Coke and Sprite.He Zhao put back a bottle of fruit juice, still unwilling to give up on their previous conversation topic. \u201cJust now, you\u2026\u201dWan Da had decided. He took a bottle of Coke, then walked towards them, whistling.Xie Yu didn\u2019t give He Zhao the chance to continue, either, and teased him instead. He pointed to a bottle of water on He Zhao\u2019s right and said into his ear, \u201cGege, I want that one.\u201dHe Zhao couldn\u2019t get angry at all and could only internally scream, Kill me.Although it was really damn satisfying to hear such a thing, they were in public and he had to restrain all notions that might have popped into his head. His little friend was playing with fire, and seemed to be having quite a good time of it.He Zhao grabbed a bottle of mineral water, glanced at the expiry date, then handed it over. \u201cI\u2019ll deal with you when we get back.\u201dXie Yu took the water, and felt that he had been childish, too. He leaned against the shelves and smiled.\u201cQing-ge went to get tabletop games.\u201d Wan Da had not paid any attention to their conversation. He tossed another bottle of soda into his cart, then turned and asked, \u201cShe should be up ahead. Shall we go see?\u201d\u201cUp ahead where?\u201d\u201cEntertainment section?\u201d Wan Da stood on his tiptoes and looked around. He saw a figure wearing an Erzhong uniform, a familiar and powerful silhouette. \u201cI see her!\u201dWhen Xie Yu and the others went over, Xu Qingqing was torn between two editions of an adventure game. \u201cLooking at the summary, one is a normal edition and one is a hard mode edition. You came at the right time. Which should I get?\u201dHe Zhao looked at them both for a while, could not decide, and said, \u201cGet them both?\u201dXie Yu didn\u2019t even glance at them. \u201cDon\u2019t get either.\u201dXu Qingqing said, \u201c\u2026Are you two serious?\u201dWan Da said to let fate decide and asked Xu Qingqing to close her eyes and pick right or left.\u201cThis one!\u201d Wan Da handed over the hard mode edition. \u201cHeaven decided! No more hesitation! Qing-ge, this one!\u201dXie Yu glanced at the shelves and saw a set of cards with \u2018Horror Game\u2019 written on it. He was intrigued and was about to pick it up when He Zhao caught onto his hand. Then, while Wan Da and Qing-ge were otherwise occupied, Xie Yu witnessed He Zhao push \u2018Horror Game\u2019 to the very back of the shelf until it could no longer be seen. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe way he acted, he was probably terrified that Wan Da would see and demand another lively game of Pen Spirit.Xie Yu was amused. \u201cHow timid can you get?\u201dHe Zhao said, \u201cThis has nothing to do with timidity. Put an end to superstition, right? That starts with me.\u201dIt had been a quick trip. When they arrived back at school, hands laden with bags, evening self-study had just begun. Old Tang, seeing that these were special circumstances and they lived in the dorms anyway, gave them some extra time to put their things down in the dorms before coming back to class.Xie Yu put down his things and washed his hands. Before he could dry them, he saw He Zhao standing in the doorway of his room, waiting for him. \u201cIs something the matter?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d When Xie Yu walked back into his room, He Zhao shut the door and said, \u201cDealing with you.\u201dXie Yu didn\u2019t like people to get too close to him. When Madam Gu mentioned his childhood, she often said both proudly and worriedly, \u201cOther kids always reach out and ask for hugs, but you\u2026 aside from me and your dad, you didn\u2019t let anyone touch you.\u201dHe probably hadn\u2019t understood very well how to interact with other people.Only He Zhao\u2014only this idiot\u2014made him want to get closer, and then closer still.When He Zhao bent down to kiss him, Xie Yu suddenly remembered that he had not thought about his future with this person.Their meeting had been an inexplicable accident. He and He Zhao had crashed into each other, and the events that had followed were both torrid and beautiful\u2026 he was worried that this whole thing was only smoke and mirrors and would soon vanish. No one could tell what the future holds. Life was so long and no one could predict what is to come.But a voice in his subconscious said, You have thought about it.You want to keep being with this idiot.He Zhao had said, \u2018deal with you,\u2019 but in reality he only kissed Xie Yu that much harder. He even held himself in check and didn\u2019t use his teeth this time. \u201cYou gave me a hard time on purpose, hm?\u201dThey were both competitive and neither gave in. Xie Yu\u2019s legs hit the edge of his bed hard and he had already fallen onto his bed by the time he came back to his senses.One of He Zhao\u2019s hands lay next to his neck, separating them. As if He Zhao was worried about suffocating him, or being unable to control himself.Xie Yu eyed him for a while, then voluntarily drew closer and pushed their lips together.Xie Yu\u2019s hand was still damp and left a cool sensation on He Zhao\u2019s wrist.He Zhao\u2019s mind lost its last shred of rationality.The dorm beds were not sturdy, and when Xie Yu turned over in the night the bed would creak. Besides, it was holding two people now. He Zhao reached beneath the hem of Xie Yu\u2019s shirt, bit by bit, first squeezing the softness at his waist, then moving upward. Xie Yu\u2019s skin was soft and he reacted immediately.Xie Yu couldn\u2019t take being touched like this, either. His instincts told him that playing around like this would cause an accident. \u201c\u2026Ge.\u201dHe Zhao, hearing this, stopped. He paused for a while, pulling his hand away from that warmth and out from beneath his little friend\u2019s shirt. Then he leaned down and bit gently on Xie Yu\u2019s neck before stopping. \u201cFuck, I\u2019m hard again.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t need to specially mention it.\u201d Xie Yu sat up, resting his back against a pillow, looking at He Zhao as he said, \u201cIt\u2019s been poking me this whole time.\u201dHe Zhao said hoarsely, \u201cYou\u2019re not much better. Shall I take care of it for you?\u201dAs He Zhao spoke, he really reached out to touch it, finding Xie Yu\u2019s hip through the material of their school trousers. His fingers were about to reach upwards when Xie Yu kicked him. \u201cGet lost.\u201dThe scuffle just now had been intense and He Zhao had no idea when he had shed his jacket. He got up, bent down, picked up the item of clothing from the floor, then asked from Xie Yu\u2019s doorway, \u201cReally don\u2019t need me to?\u201dHe received, in reply, a pillow Xie Yu had thrown.Xie Yu took a cold shower and it was nearly half an hour before it subsided. He turned off the shower and the chill had passed but he still felt warm.Wan Da put his things down, then dawdled about his dorm room for a while. He played two rounds of a video game, and when he was ready to go back to class, he went upstairs to get the two Big Bros to go with him.When Wan Da went over and knocked on the door, he found that both of them had changed their clothes, hair still dripping water. Wan Da swallowed back all the words he was about to say. \u201cYou\u2019re taking a shower at this time of night?\u201dHe really could not answer. He Zhao was rendered speechless, a rare occurrence. He stood in the doorway and glanced at Xie Yu in the opposite doorway, indicating for him to say something.So Xie Yu hesitated a while, then replied, \u201cNone of your business?\u201dHe Zhao: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWan Da: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dFiercely anticipated by everyone in second year, the day of the fall class trip finally arrived.The itinerary was the same as always, like a School Fall Class Trip Classic Set Meal. The venue was a public park near a theme park, with a good view. They could take pictures and relax, and there was also an archery range and a mini-theater nearby.In the morning, the whole school building was in an uproar. Dean Jiang came over to give a speech, which brought about a temporary quiet, but when Dean Jiang left they continued making a scene.Liu Cunhao opened his bag in front of everyone, showing off what he had brought. \u201cSee all of this? A bag of Lay\u2019s potato chips, some bread, some chewing gum\u2026 I\u2019ll share with everyone later.\u201dHe Zhao didn\u2019t want to lose out. \u201cLook at mine and Old Xie\u2019s. See this? Green pepper flavor. I bet you\u2019ve never eaten this in your life.\u201dXie Yu pressed a hand to his forehead and reminded him, \u201cThat\u2019s yours. Don\u2019t drag me into it.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s mine is yours.\u201d\u201c\u2026Just forget it.\u201dOld Tang wore blue exercise wear, probably wanting to project an image of youthful vigor. But on his slightly pudgy frame it made people think it would be better to give him a rocking chair and let him slowly rock in it.\u201cSeveral important things first.\u201d Old Tang pulled out an itinerary, then a piece of chalk. \u201cEveryone split into groups and pick a group leader. You all know my phone number, right? If you don\u2019t, here it is again\u2026 if anything happens, just call me, or look for the tour guide.\u201dThere were about thirty people in the class and they were freely allowed to form groups.There was only one objective in going out: to have a good time. Liu Cunhao had had enough of managing the class as class rep, so this time he didn\u2019t want to be the group leader. He passed the position to He Zhao. \u201cZhao-ge, actually, since the first day of school I\u2019ve thought you were an impressive person. Your radiance, your leadership qualities\u2014you\u2019re a dragon among people, and undefeatable\u2014\u201dAt this, Xie Yu let out a laugh.He Zhao waved a hand dismissively, indicating for him to stop. \u201cAll right, all right, I get what you mean.\u201dWhile He Zhao was rounding everyone up, Luo Wenqiang wanted to join their group but He Zhao said, \u201cYou can\u2019t. You eat too much.\u201dLiu Cunhao followed up, \u201cI think you can\u2019t, too.\u201dLuo Wenqiang was stunned. \u201cAre you really going to be like that? What about love for your classmates?\u201dXie Yu was watching the excitement unfold. Luo Wenqiang had no recourse and Xie Yu got to watch the beefcake say to him in despair, \u201cYu-ge, tell them!\u201dHe Zhao said, \u201cDon\u2019t call Yu-ge. No use calling Yu-ge. Your Yu-ge is\u2026 my friend.\u201dThankfully he reacted fast or he might have said \u201cmine.\u201dXie Yu heard him and, after thinking about it, decided to take his boyfriend\u2019s side. \u201cMm. No use calling me.\u201dLuo Wenqiang: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dOld Tang was still explaining guidelines. \u201cWhen you go out, be careful to keep the place clean. Don\u2019t litter at the venue. Embody the spirit and good upbringing of our youth\u2026\u201dEveryone nodded, hoping to get it over with. \u201cAll right, got it.\u201dLuo Wenqiang wasn\u2019t ready to give up. He wagged a finger in the air. \u201cAll right, I finally see your true colors. All this talk about friendship is just hot air.\u201dHe Zhao added Luo Wenqiang\u2019s name to his paper, then motioned for him to scram. \u201cEnough. If you keep talking, we won\u2019t take you.\u201dThe bus quieted when the tour guide entered.The tour guide was a man wearing a red cap and with a megaphone in hand, and he waved as he entered. \u201cHello, students. How are you doing?\u201dThe groups handed their name lists to the tour guide. When he took He Zhao\u2019s group\u2019s list, Xie Yu saw the confusion in the tour guide\u2019s eyes, as if asking, What is this? Who are these people?Xie Yu tore a page from his exercise book and wrote down the six names again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 85": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fake SlackersChapter 063 - A touch and a glancePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayFake SlackersTranslator: JuryEditor: NomNomFirst Published on Chaleuria\u2014063 \u2013 A touch and a glanceXie Yu handed over the newly-written list of names.In dark ink on white paper, his handwriting was sharp and elegant. The six names on the sheet were written beautifully.Although Xie Yu got most of the questions on his homework wrong, and for his math homework he often just copied the questions and left the solution space blank, the teachers had not yet given up on him. Just his handwriting alone could soothe their tempers quite a bit.Whenever a teacher commented that this handwriting was wasted, someone else would say, \u201cBetter than He Zhao, at least. I get mad whenever I grab his homework. That boy thinks of everything\u2026\u201dThe tour guide looked at Xie Yu like his saving grace.This was despite the fact that the boy before him seemed quite aloof, and his chilly aura was even stronger than his appearance.For some reason, however, when the boy handed over the sheet of paper and then glanced at him, he felt as if his life was in danger.The tour guide took the paper. \u201c\u2026Th-thank you.\u201dXie Yu said, \u201cNo problem.\u201dHe Zhao thought highly of himself, and besides, he had written quite carefully this time. Surely it wasn\u2019t unreadable. He stood next to the podium, about to explain himself, when Xie Yu kicked him.\u201cGo back,\u201d Xie Yu said. \u201cDon\u2019t embarrass yourself.\u201dHe Zhao said as he left, \u201cNo, I wrote it quite nicely this time around. My handwriting was neat and impressive\u2026\u201dXie Yu said, \u201cShut up, will you?\u201dAll of Class 3 knew what He Zhao\u2019s handwriting looked like. At first glance it was indeed dizzying, but after over two months of looking at it they had more or less figured out how to decipher it.They were the names of classmates, so anyone from Class 3 who glanced at the paper could tell by the shape who He Zhao had meant. But the tour guide was unfamiliar with them and had surely been confused.Liu Cunhao covered his face with his hands. \u201cWhat was I thinking, asking Zhao-ge to be the leader?\u201dWan Da patted him. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. What can you do, anyway? Keep going and don\u2019t look back.\u201dLiu Cunhao: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cStudents, we\u2019re going to Northlake Park, a well-known sightseeing spot in C City. I\u2019ll give you the detailed itinerary when we get on the bus.\u201d The tour guide straightened his cap then continued, saying that he hoped they would have a happy trip, and so on\u2026 a load of useless formalities. At the end, he said, \u201c\u2026Class 2.3\u2019s bus is at the rear gate. Let\u2019s form a line in the corridor.\u201dTwo other classes were already lined up in the corridor and Old Tang hurriedly followed to say, \u201cLine up properly and be quiet. The other classes are still holding lessons.\u201dThe tour guide had gone on for a long time and Xie Yu had dozed off in the middle. By the time the others had all gone outside, he was still slumped on his desk, not moving.He Zhao crooked a finger, turned, and knocked on Xie Yu\u2019s side of the desk. \u201cGet up. We need to line up.\u201dOld Tang also gave a long speech. After talking about conduct, he gave many reminders, as if they were an elementary school students going on a class trip. Finally, someone couldn\u2019t take it any more and called out, \u201cDo we need to hold hands too? Let\u2019s just hold hands and go.\u201dThe student finished speaking, then Xie Yu opened his eyes. He Zhao had already reached out to him.There was a proper chair there, but He Zhao had chosen to sit on the desk instead, his jacket open with its zipper undone. He smiled and said, \u201cLittle friend, hold my hand?\u201dThe sight of him smiling was just too pleasant.The back of He Zhao\u2019s hand lay on the desk, palm up.Someone had been yelling about holding hands, so it should be fine for them to hold hands now, for a while.A moment passed. Xie Yu said nothing and covered He Zhao\u2019s hand with his.\u201cOhh\u2014\u201dIn the corridor, someone near the end of the line called out and all of Class 3 followed, meaningful \u2018Ohh\u2014\u2019s ringing out.He Zhao was worried that the strong reaction would scare Xie Yu and said, \u201cWhat\u2019re you \u2018oh\u2019-ing about?\u201dLiu Cunhao said, \u201cZhao-ge, you\u2019re so obliging. Someone said to hold hands and you did it immediately.\u201dThis was purely to tease Old Tang and Liu Cunhao wasn\u2019t thinking about anything else. Besides, the two Big Bros of their class had always been this touchy-feely and had even held hands in class before.Tang Sen was amused. He shook his head, smiled, and didn\u2019t keep going on about conduct. It was just a day trip, after all. Let them have their fun.When they got on the bus, the girls got on first to pick seats, mostly in pairs. Xie Yu and He Zhao brought up the rear, and there were only two seats left in the last row by the time they boarded.Wan Da, sitting right in the middle of the last row, waved to them. \u201cHere, come on, come on.\u201dXie Yu glanced around and asked, \u201cNo other seats?\u201dLiu Cunhao and the others were sitting in the last row. They were all energetic, and would probably make so much noise once they were on the road that Xie Yu wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep.Liu Cunhao figured out Xie Yu\u2019s intent. \u201cYu-ge, you don\u2019t like sitting with us?\u201dXie Yu replied, \u201cYeah.\u201dThey had walked to the middle of the bus. On Xie Yu\u2019s right was Xu Qingqing, who had already opened a bag of snacks and was laughing out loud. \u201cHa ha ha ha ha. You brought it on yourself.\u201dHe Zhao laughed, too. \u201cHao-zi, if you already knew, then why did you have to ask and hurt yourself?\u201dLiu Cunhao: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAlthough they made a fuss, there was no other place to sit.After everyone sat down, the bus began to move. It took the back way out of the school grounds and turned onto a side road.The tour guide held onto the railing and gave his name. No one remembered his full name, only that his last name was Wang, so everyone called him \u2018Wang-ge.\u2019 The tour guide scratched his head. \u201cAll right. Wang-ge\u2026 Wang-ge will be fine.\u201dXie Yu had started growing sleepy back in the classroom and now the drowsiness returned in full force. He leaned against the window, intending to sleep for a while, but before his head touched the glass He Zhao pulled him towards him. \u201cYou\u2019ll lean on the window but not on your gege?\u201dThe words \u2018gege\u2019 were like a curse. When He Zhao heard them, he replayed a certain set of scenes in his mind.He Zhao had initiated this conversation, but the moment the words left his mouth, he coughed lightly and thought, Damn, I brought this on myself.Xie Yu couldn\u2019t take it, either, and the most obvious indicator of that was that he couldn\u2019t fall asleep, any more.The back way out of school was long and narrow. The bus travelled slowly, passing by the street where the restaurants were. The midterm banner over Valedictorian House was still there. A stray dog lay at the entrance to the Gold List Restaurant, head drooping as it watched the crowds go by,Wang-ge went over some of Northlake Park\u2019s history, as well as the various important buildings in the park. Among them was a famous author\u2019s old residence. \u201cYou all know him, right? He wrote\u2026\u201dThe mention of literature aroused Old Tang\u2019s teacher\u2019s instinct. He could give them a literature lecture with a minute\u2019s notice without needing to prep. He got up and took the megaphone from the tour guide. \u201cLet me say something, let me say something\u2026\u201dAll of Class 3 said, \u201c\u2026Don\u2019t let him!\u201dLiu Cunhao was about to cry. \u201cI thought we\u2019d have a good time today.\u201dWan Da said, \u201cYeah, we were supposed to have a good time today.\u201dAmidst the noise, one of them moved first. The backs of their hands lay against each other silently for a while, then He Zhao\u2019s fingers entwined with Xie Yu\u2019s.Sometimes, contentment came very easily.A touch, a glance, and the warmth that came with it.Xie Yu was content.The bus grew noisier and noisier. The moment Luo Wenqiang gathered the guts to take the megaphone from Old Tang\u2019s hand, the bus went wild.\u201cLet\u2019s sing,\u201d Xu Qingqing suggested. \u201cPrizes for participating.\u201dEveryone clapped and agreed, then asked, \u201cWhat prizes?\u201dAlthough there were no prizes, Class 3\u2019s karaoke competition started up anyway.Most of them didn\u2019t sing very well and the music was more like noise, but the singers were very caught up in it. Old Tang devotedly sang An Unforgettable Night.He Zhao was a very obliging person, and no matter how the singer sang, he could turn his back on his conscience and give praise. \u201cWell done! You sang so well!\u201dSang well, my ass.Xie Yu didn\u2019t understand this at all. He moved his hand, fingertips coming to rest on He Zhao\u2019s knuckles. \u201cIs that sarcasm?\u201dHe Zhao replied, \u201cNo, it\u2019s encouragement.\u201dOld Tang was embarrassed from the praise, but he still waved at the audience and decided to sing again. \u201cSince you like it, I\u2019ll\u2026\u201dHe Zhao had never imagined that their homeroom teacher would be a mic hog. \u201cAh?!\u201dThe students in the front row were so mad they threw water bottles at him.By the time Old Tang was done singing, the other students had changed their minds and started calling out, \u201cZhao-ge, a song! Make it up to us!\u201dHe Zhao agreed quickly. \u201cSure. I\u2019m very good at singing. You\u2019re in luck today\u2014Old Xie, what song do you want?\u201dXie Yu had never heard He Zhao sing, but he felt that something wasn\u2019t right with He Zhao\u2019s confidence. Mostly, it was because He Zhao often spoke of his handwriting the same way, as if no one in heaven or on earth could measure up to it, but in the end it was still terrible.But it was clearly written in He Zhao\u2019s eyes: Whatever you want to hear, I\u2019ll sing it for you.Xie Yu had been about to say something but on his tongue the words turned into, \u201cAnything is fine.\u201dAll of Class 3 thought that, based on He Zhao\u2019s character, he would sing something powerful.Contrary to all their expectations, He Zhao picked a love song.The song had originally been sung by a woman, and was gentle and slow.The megaphone was passed back from the front. Before He Zhao turned it on, Xie Yu heard him whisper, \u201cThey\u2019re lucky this time\u2026 I\u2019m singing this for my little friend.\u201dThis was probably the one time He Zhao was not full of hot air.He actually did sing quite well, his voice echoing softly in Xie Yu\u2019s ear. The song seemed different from the original, since it was a male voice singing it, but it was still gentle.A restrained, masculine gentleness leaked from the words.The interior of the bus suddenly quieted.Away from the eyes of others, their hands were still secretly linked, as if they could feel each other\u2019s heartbeats through their interlaced fingers.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

No one had expected it.Xu Qingqing had been watching a video on her phone. Four minutes had passed while she hadn\u2019t been paying attention to the video\u2019s contents.\u201cImpossible,\u201d Xu Qingqing said, looking back. \u201cZhao-ge, he\u2026\u201dShe cut herself off halfway.Because she saw He Zhao turn, as if to meet Xie Yu\u2019s eyes.Yu-ge, whom no one in their class dared provoke, had not fully closed the curtain next to him. Sunlight shone through the small gap onto his hair.The sunlight made him look warm.\u2014Xie Yu, who, at first glance, looked like a person without warmth.Liu Cunhao was the first to react. \u201cPrince of love songs, Zhao-ge.\u201dWan Da, bag of chips in hand and mouth open, said, \u201cHow about\u2026 how about an encore?\u201dHe Zhao shut off the megaphone and handed it forward. \u201cNah. I\u2019ll let you all live.\u201dThe others started calling for an encore, too, but He Zhao really had no intention of singing any more. After passing the megaphone back, he turned off the music on his phone. He looked up and found that Xie Yu was watching him. \u201cStunned? Was it so good\u2026\u201dHe wasn\u2019t content with the praises of others and was about to praise himself to the skies, too.As he drew nearer, Xie Yu stopped the praise in its tracks, smiled and said, \u201cYeah.\u201dSince the singer with actual ability no longer wanted to sing any more, Class 3 had to listen to Old Tang sing. He sang oldies, with a very strong sense of the time period, which made all who listened feel like they had aged twenty years.Two songs later they really couldn\u2019t take it anymore, but they couldn\u2019t bear to take a swing at Old Tang\u2019s confidence, either.So, even though the bus seemed calm on the surface, their group chat was roiling.[Liu Cunhao]: Who\u2019ll stop him?[Xu Qingqing]: I can\u2019t think of a good reason. Next, please?[Luo Wenqiang]: Beyond me, too. Next.Xie Yu watched them discuss for a while and actually came up with something, albeit a strange approach.Liu Cunhao raised his hand and said, \u201cTeach, we\u2019d better quiet down so we don\u2019t distract the driver.\u201dThe driver: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dXie Yu had been tapping out a reply with one hand. His position was uncomfortable, so he just exited the group chat and took out a pair of earphones from his pocket. \u201cWant to watch a movie, Prince of Love Songs?\u201dThis newly coined nickname already sounded embarrassing.He Zhao took one earbud and said, \u201cDrop it. It sounds like I sing love songs to harass people all the time. I\u2019ve only ever sung for you\u2026 what movie is this?\u201dXie Yu had just randomly downloaded it.It had been on his phone for a long time. Xie Yu had never had much patience for watching movies; occasionally he would put one on to kill time, but he didn\u2019t get invested and often fast-forwarded through it.There was a mini-theater on Black Water Street where Dalei and the others would go when they had some spare change.Xie Yu had been once before. An hour and 20 minutes. He had gone in blank-faced and come out blank-faced.Dalei and Da Mei had walked out behind him, both bawling their eyes out, unable to extricate themselves from the emotions the movie had evoked. They had cried the whole way back. \u201cIt\u2019s terrible. A terminal illness separated them\u2026\u201dXie Yu endured them for a block, then couldn\u2019t hold back any longer. \u201cIt was the script that separated them.\u201dHe Zhao glanced at the thumbnail: it was an absurdist comedy film. Both the male and female lead looked familiar and the plot sounded familiar, too. He thought for a while, then remembered. \u201cI\u2019ve seen this before. It\u2019s quite good.\u201dBefore he finished speaking, Xie Yu had already pressed the top right corner to close out of the video.\u201c\u2014What did you shut it off for?\u201dAfter closing it, Xie Yu hooked a finger around the earbud wire, trying to get it back from He Zhao. \u201cYou\u2019ve already seen it, right?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve seen it,\u201d He Zhao said, raising one hand to hold the earbud in place so Xie Yu couldn\u2019t take it back. He smiled and said, \u201cBut I haven\u2019t seen it with you.\u201dLiu Cunhao, on He Zhao\u2019s other side, sensed something wasn\u2019t right. Ever since He Zhao had sung that love song, an indescribable atmosphere had surrounded him.He glanced left and right, his gaze finally landing on the two Big Bros watching a movie together, and realized he had found the source.Eventually, he tapped Wan Da and asked hesitantly, \u201cDo you think there\u2019s\u2026 something between them?\u201dC City was not far, about forty minutes away.They had watched less than half the movie before the bus pulled into a parking lot near Northlake Park. Everyone packed up their things and started getting off the bus.Xie Yu waited until most of the passengers had left, then held onto the backs of the seats in front of him and got up.He Zhao let go of his hand and, while no one was looking, placed his hand on Xie Yu\u2019s waist instead. Through the material, he felt Xie Yu\u2019s familiar warmth. As if possessed, he asked, \u201cAre\u2026 you going home this weekend?\u201dXie Yu had been about to squeeze through the gap between He Zhao\u2019s knees and the seats in front, but now he paused and faintly smiled, glancing back. \u201cBoyfriend, what are you thinking of?\u201dWhat else would he be thinking of?Both of them were well aware.\u201cLet\u2019s line up and go in. Later, I\u2019ll take you around Northlake Park once and then you can go off on your own,\u201d the tour guide shouted into his megaphone. \u201cFree activity time lasts till two. Please come back on time.\u201dThe scenic spots were by the lake. After circling the lake once and listening to three stories about the locale from the tour guide, they split into small groups and went off on their own.A group of six gathered by the road.He Zhao asked, \u201cWhere do you want to go?\u201dLuo Wenqiang enthusiastically considered the question. \u201cThe cinema? Let\u2019s see what movies are playing.\u201dLiu Cunhao had no interest in the cinema and pointed to the upper right corner of the map. \u201cIf you\u2019re a man, it\u2019s the archery range.\u201d\u201cNo! The cinema!\u201d\u201cLuo Wenqiang, you aren\u2019t a man!\u201dXie Yu was indifferent. He had no interest in any of it, anyway.Luo Wenqiang and Liu Cunhao continued arguing. Group Leader He squatted by the roadside listening to them for a while, and felt a headache coming on.He eventually showcased his leadership talent. He pulled a lollipop from his pocket and unwrapped it as he said, \u201cAll right, stop it. Rock-paper-scissors. Best of three.\u201dIt was a rather wishy-washy way of handling things.During the argument, Wan Da had carefully examined the map and two words tucked away in a corner eventually caught his attention: Haunted House.Wan Da\u2019s eyes lit up. He glanced up and said, \u201cThere\u2019s a haunted house! Shall we go?\u201dXie Yu saw He Zhao\u2019s hand tremble around the lollipop.\u201cThat\u2019s good. Thrilling.\u201d Luo Wenqiang put the cinema to the back of his mind, then leaned over to read the description of the haunted house out loud. \u201c\u2026Fierce ghosts galore! They died in all sorts of ways. Guaranteed scares. You\u2019ll scream out loud.\u201dHe Zhao hadn\u2019t even had the time to persuade him otherwise.Liu Cunhao nodded, primarily impressed by the description. \u201cIt sounds interesting. Let\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cYu-ge, what do you think?\u201d After discussing it, Liu Cunhao turned to ask Xie Yu. \u201cShall we go to the haunted house?\u201dXie Yu squatted by the road, originally intending to put in his two cents after they had argued another half an hour, but they had resolved the quibble quickly, after all. He then glanced at He Zhao, lollipop in mouth as he pretended to be calm, and thought it might be interesting. \u201cSure.\u201dGroup Leader He, who had completely lost his say in anything: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe others in the group happily walked on, map in hand. He Zhao walked at the back, slowing down. \u201cWho betrays their boyfriend like that?\u201d\u201cWho\u2019s as timid as you are?\u201d Xie Yu slowed down too, then said, \u201c\u2026Don\u2019t say anything about avoiding superstition.\u201dHe Zhao was speechless. \u201cHeartless.\u201dFallen leaves covered the ground. The crowds parted, the roads growing more empty and less crowded than before on either side.He Zhao was still thinking about just how much of a white-eyed wolf\u00b9 his boyfriend was. After thinking about it for a while, Xie Yu suddenly stopped in front of him.Then he heard the white-eyed wolf say to him, \u201cNo need to be scared. This time, I\u2019ll protect you.\u201dThese words sounded familiar. He Zhao remembered the incident in the dorm building where the ghost had turned out to be a farce. Mad Dog had said he would discipline them but the monthly exams had passed and nothing had happened, so he had probably forgotten about it amidst all the other things he had to do.He Zhao couldn\u2019t hold back a laugh. He crunched up the lollipop in his mouth, sweetness spreading over his tongue, then said, \u201cSure, big bro.\u201dAlthough Northlake Park was called a park, it was very big. Around the lake many tourist attractions spanned a wide area. They could walk all day and still not manage to see it all.\u201cWhere is it? If we keep walking we\u2019ll leave the park.\u201d Liu Cunhao studied the map as he walked. Although he had said he didn\u2019t want to be the group leader, he had taken on the heavy responsibility in the end, anyway. \u201cThis is very mysterious.\u201dThey wandered about for a while and finally noticed an unobtrusive entrance with a short line of people outside.There was a sign to one side, too.It was decorated with several handprints in red paint that dripped downward from the fingertips. A word was written on the side: HELP.\u201cInteresting.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s here! It\u2019s definitely here! Leader, go get tickets!\u201dWhen He Zhao went to get the tickets he nearly asked for five.\u201cSix tickets.\u201d He Zhao bent down, glancing through the counter window. After receiving the tickets, he said, \u201cThank you.\u201dHe was about to leave when the cashier asked, \u201cWhich school are you from?\u201d\u201cErzhong.\u201d\u201cWhich Erzhong? The one in this city?\u201d\u201cNo, A City. Liyang Erzhong, beautiful school grounds, well-staffed, with sixty years of history\u2026\u201dHe Zhao looked as if he wanted to stay and chat with the cashier about Liyang Erzhong\u2019s history for another half an hour.\u201cFriend.\u201d Xie Yu leaned against the wall, looking at him. \u201cThe way you go on, you could be a student ambassador.\u201dWan Da and the others were anxious, too. The line was moving quickly and it would be their turn after the group ahead of them entered, but they still hadn\u2019t gotten their tickets. \u201cLeader, are you done over there? So slow. They\u2019re about to check tickets.\u201dThe group ahead of them went in, and not long after came the terrified scream of a girl.The screams continued for more than ten minutes.It made their hair stand on end.After the screams slowly faded, someone lifted a corner of the black curtain in front of them and a black-gloved hand reached out. A hoarse voice said, \u201cTickets.\u201dThey didn\u2019t expect the ticket checker to be their first surprise.Xie Yu handed the tickets over, then the group ducked under the curtain and went in. When they looked up again, they saw the twisted face and scary smile of a \u2018ghost\u2019 still holding their tickets.This \u2018ghost\u2019 was very immersed in his act and gave a terrifying laugh.Xie Yu\u2019s face was blank. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe glanced around. The design of the haunted house was very ordinary: pitch-dark, the weak lighting illuminating skeletons and human remains on the wall.And there was a \u2018female ghost\u2019 sitting on a chair in front of them.She wore a red dress, long hair reaching her knees, the black and the red combining to form a strange aura.After they entered, things started to move very slowly around them.The audio and lighting effects were good, but the content was still rather cliche.They had only taken two steps in when Wan Da commented, \u201cHow boring.\u201dLuo Wenqiang said, \u201cNot scared at all. I\u2019m even a bit amused.\u201dLiu Cunhao said, \u201cShall we show some respect for their craft? Scream a bit? Or they might be very embarrassed.\u201dAlthough the haunted house wasn\u2019t up to par, Xie Yu thought about it for a while and considered that maybe a certain idiot would still have been scared.So he reached behind him. It took two tries before he caught hold of He Zhao\u2019s hand.He Zhao had never done this before. He had been scared stiff just by the words \u2018haunted house\u2019 and the gaps his own imagination had filled in. But after he had really come in, a person wearing a mask and calling himself a ghost wasn\u2019t enough to scare him.But the feeling of his little friend reaching out to hold his hand was really too good.\u201cI\u2019m really scared,\u201d He Zhao emphasized.Xie Yu said, \u201cShall I pull off their masks for you? Tell me which one you want to see.\u201dHe Zhao had no doubt that Xie Yu really would do it.Worried that Xie Yu would act on his word, He Zhao said, \u201cNo need. I think I can hold on.\u201dThey left the haunted house near noon.No one talked about going to the cinema or the archery range. They only wanted to find a spot to sit down and eat.Liu Cunhao glanced at the class group chat. \u201cQing-ge says the rest area is very crowded and there are no seats. She asks if any of us want to go picnic with her.\u201d\u201cWhere is she?\u201d\u201cJust up ahead. Not far.\u201dWhen they got there, Xu Qingqing and the others were about to play truth or dare. She opened up the Hard Mode edition deck of cards she had bought at the mall and glanced at the punishments in it.\u201cThis is terrible. If you get one, you\u2019re done for.\u201d Seeing He Zhao and Xie Yu approach, Xu Qingqing smiled and glanced up. \u201cYou\u2019re just in time. Want to play?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe Zhao asked for two cards and handed one to Xie Yu. \u201cOld Xie, up for it?\u201dXie Yu: \u201cAll right.\u201d\u201cIf we play you\u2019re not to choose dare.\u201dXie Yu didn\u2019t understand. \u201cHuh?\u201dHe Zhao continued, \u201cWhat if you end up getting handsy with someone?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They had ridden once around the lake and were tired, and towels hung around their necks as if bike riding was strenuous exercise.Old Tang stood by the road and watched them for a while, smiling. \u201cHave you all eaten yet?\u201dAll of Class 3 sat up straight and replied in unison, \u201cWe have, we have.\u201dOld Tang was about to continue but Mad Dog dragged him away. \u201cThat\u2019s enough. Don\u2019t think that just because they\u2019re smiling\u2026 these brats can\u2019t wait for us to get lost.\u201dXie Yu was naturally lucky and had done well over the last few rounds with ease. Not only did he not receive a single punishment, he had even drawn the king card twice.Xu Qingqing recalled that round of Dou Dizhu before evening self-study with Xie Yu and her fear of being soundly beaten. It was fine that he was lucky at Dou Dizhu, but how did he do so well even with card games?!This really was a terrible gaming experience!The round ended. Xu Qingqing put the cards back and they started to draw again.Xie Yu picked one at random and flipped it over to reveal another king.Xu Qingqing: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dUp till now Xie Yu had found nothing to be very exciting about this game. He held the card between two fingers, still sitting on the ground. \u201cThat\u2019s all? This is boring.\u201dXu Qingqing said, \u201cYou\u2019re not human.\u201dWan Da shook his head and said gravely, \u201cYu-ge, we\u2019re not like you.\u201dLuo Wenqiang had been targeted by Xie Yu twice in a row. The dare punishments in the Hard Mode edition were really twisted: he had nearly given his first kiss to Liu Cunhao, and was now terrified. He turned and shouted, \u201cZhao-ge, control your deskmate!\u201dHe Zhao, sitting beside Xie Yu, was amused. He smiled and said, \u201cControl what? I can\u2019t control him.\u201dThe voices of the people won out in the end and took away a certain star player\u2019s game privileges. Xie Yu was made to back out of the game.Xu Qingqing took back the king Xie Yu had just drawn. Xie Yu blinked, unsure whether to smile. \u201cHow can you do that?\u201dLiu Cunhao returned his card to Xu Qingqing and got ready to redraw. \u201cSorry, Yu-ge. You\u2019re too strong. Life is unfair.\u201dHe Zhao patted his little friend\u2019s head, then couldn\u2019t keep himself from tousling his hair. He consoled, \u201cThey\u2019re not worthy of playing with someone as skilled as my deskmate.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s this about \u2018them?\u2019\u201d The others didn\u2019t like the way this sounded. \u201cZhao-ge, have a heart. At least count yourself among us, can you?\u201dHe Zhao said, \u201cI\u2019m not the same. I\u2019m a strong player, too.\u201dXie Yu had no opinion on being made to back out of the game. It was no fun, anyway. He moved backwards a little, sitting behind He Zhao, and glanced down at his phone. If he leaned forward several more centimeters he would touch He Zhao\u2019s back.He Zhao was worried Xie Yu would get bored and took several snacks from his bag. \u201cFood?\u201dXie Yu glanced at the several small packets of walnuts by his hand. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAlthough Xie Yu wasn\u2019t sure why He Zhao would have brought walnuts on a class trip, he thought, Better you eat them yourself.In reality, He Zhao was not as skilled a player as he made himself out to be. The only reason he hadn\u2019t been picked yet was that the king cards had all been in Xie Yu\u2019s hand.Each time Xie Yu picked a card, while the others were not looking, he would reach over and He Zhao would write a number on his hand. Knowing what number He Zhao was, Xie Yu would never pick him.The gentle brush of his fingers over Xie Yu\u2019s palm was a little ticklish, as if he was flirting.At first He Zhao had just written numbers, but two rounds later he started writing words.He wrote the same thing down several times before Xie Yu asked, \u201c\u2026What is this?\u201dHe Zhao whispered, \u201cFeel it with your heart\u201dOther people would write one stroke at a time, but this idiot wrote the whole word down at once. Feel it, my ass.Xie Yu really couldn\u2019t feel anything. \u201cSorry, we assassins don\u2019t have hearts.\u201d\u201cThree words.\u201d He Zhao decided to play coy, but a few minutes later he couldn\u2019t keep himself from saying, \u201cI like you.\u201dNow that his high-level boyfriend was no longer in the game, He Zhao\u2019s good luck had run out.Those who mess around in the streets must eventually pay the piper, and maybe He Zhao had to pay his boyfriend\u2019s share back, as well, because he got hit twice in a row. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dXu Qingqing had drawn the king card for the first time and was euphoric. She asked haughtily, \u201cWhich of you is number two?\u201dHe Zhao tossed his \u20182\u2019 card out.The crowd exploded.\u201cAren\u2019t you a strong player, Zhao-ge?\u201d\u201cHeaven has mercy on no one!\u201d\u201cQing-ge, don\u2019t let him off! Give him a hard time!\u201d\u201cTruth.\u201d Facing the crazed crowd, He Zhao made his intentions clear.Xu Qingqing wasn\u2019t sure what to ask, either. In order not to sow discord and let everyone remain friends in the future, she picked a truth punishment card. As luck would have it, the question was quite tame. \u201cHow far have you gone with your girl/boyfriend?\u201dXie Yu, the boyfriend: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dShen Jie had bought some takeout at the rest area and phoned his Zhao-ge as he ate, wanting to ask him where he was, but the call didn\u2019t go through. Shen Jie turned off his phone, got up, threw away the takeout box, then walked around looking for a place to smoke.Not long after leaving the rest stop, he heard people yelling. \u201cOoh\u2014\u201dIn a very strange tone of voice, too.Shen Jie faintly heard the voice of Class 3\u2019s class rep. His grip tightened around his pack of cigarettes as he walked over. It really was Class 3.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Shen Jie squeezed through a gap in the shrubs. \u201cI heard you from way over there\u2026 Zhao-ge, I called you but you didn\u2019t pick up.\u201dShen Jie dropped by Class 3 all the time, and Class 3\u2019s students often used him as an excuse for being late, saying he got sick again. He was more or less one of them.Wan Da made a space for him. \u201cSit down. We\u2019re playing cards.\u201dXu Qingqing urged, \u201cZhao-ge, can you answer the question?\u201dAmidst the crowd\u2019s murmuring, He Zhao scratched his head and said, \u201cHow far, huh\u2026 everything that needs to be done has been done.\u201dXie Yu pinched him hard at the waist.His answer was very vague and left a lot to the imagination, and the crowd got more and more restless.Xie Yu let go and asked, \u201cWhat do you mean by \u2018everything that needs to be done has been done?\u2019\u201dHe Zhao calmly leaned backwards. \u201cWhat did you want me to say? That we\u2019re at the point where they\u2019re in bed, crying \u2018gege?\u2019\u201dAlthough no one had known that He Zhao had a partner, given his looks, it wasn\u2019t unexpected. His partner might even be someone from a different school.Luo Wenqiang didn\u2019t let up. \u201cHe\u2019s dodging the question, Qing-ge! Does that count as breaking the rules? What exactly did you do?\u201dShen Jie, sitting and listening, had gotten the gist of the question, but the answer didn\u2019t seem quite right.When Xu Qingqing started distributing the cards again, Shen Jie finally had an epiphany. Then he thought in shock, Since when did Zhao-ge have a partner?He Zhao was sitting opposite him and there were many people around, so he couldn\u2019t ask directly.Shen Jie tapped furiously away at his phone.Zhao-ge, you escaped the single life?When did you get a partner?Fuck, who is it?Are we still bros?He Zhao didn\u2019t even look at his phone. After answering the punishment question, he saw that Xie Yu had not yet touched the walnuts, so he opened a packet and handed it over.Xie Yu\u2019s feelings on receiving the walnuts were very complicated.The unlucky victim of the next round was He Zhao again.The question this time around was rather ordinary, the kind of truth question no one found fun.\u201cWhat is your greatest regret?\u201dEveryone\u2019s excitement dropped when the card was pulled out. The answer was probably something inconsequential. What could they have be to regret?Xie Yu waited for He Zhao to come up with an absurd story but He Zhao said nothing.Class 3 had picked a spot close to the lake. When the wind blew, it skimmed the surface of the water, bringing a chill with it.He Zhao looked down, his eyelashes casting shadows over his face. Who knew what he was thinking. After a while, he looked up and said, \u201cIn third year of junior high, because of me, a friend of mine\u2026\u201dHe abruptly cut himself off.He Zhao found that he still hadn\u2019t overcome this obstacle.The moment it was brought up he felt so stifled he nearly panicked.He couldn\u2019t go on.Everyone else glanced around, unsure what had just happened.Xie Yu suddenly remembered He Zhao sitting in the stairwell and smoking in the middle of the night.He Zhao, who caught him when he jumped off the wall and called him a cripple.Liu Cunhao noticed that He Zhao had answered this question rather reluctantly and waved a hand dismissively. \u201cThis is a boring question. Next, next, next.\u201dThe others didn\u2019t mind, either. They put the cards back and began to draw again.Amidst the excitement and subsequent conversation, the question was forgotten.He Zhao pulled out his phone to check the time, then saw that Shen Jie had called him a few times. A dozen missed calls, and six or seven texts.He gave them a cursory glance and was about to reply when something collided with his back.Xie Yu was still looking down at his own phone, but he had leaned forward slightly and his forehead rested against He Zhao\u2019s back.Xie Yu moved his fingers, tapping on the screen.The next moment, He Zhao heard his phone vibrate.[Little friend]: ?Xie Yu waited for a while but He Zhao did not reply. He lifted his hand again and lightly touched He Zhao\u2019s back.After several rounds of cards, it was about time for the class to regroup. Xu Qingqing put the cards away and Liu Cunhao reminded everyone, \u201cDo you remember where we\u2019re meeting? It\u2019s almost time. Don\u2019t be late.\u201dThere was half an hour left. They couldn\u2019t do anything in that time except walk around.There were just a few small stores around left to visit.Xu Qingqing was collecting the cards. Xie Yu had just handed them over when He Zhao caught hold of his other wrist, then pulled him to one side, away from the chaos.\u201cWhat\u2019s gotten into you?\u201d\u201cCan I hug you?\u201d He Zhao said. \u201cJust for a while.\u201dShen Jie passed the cards back, then looked around for He Zhao but found his spot empty. He froze for a while, then glanced at his phone. On it was He Zhao\u2019s message, short and succinct: Let me introduce you: this is Xie Yu, my boyfriend.After the cards were collected, the group wondered aloud again where they should go.Luo Wenqiang suggested, \u201cLet\u2019s buy some local souvenirs?\u201dLiu Cunhao said, \u201cC City is forty minutes away. What local things? What does C City have that we don\u2019t?\u201dAfter discussing it, they decided to go to the souvenir store after all. It would be a waste not to buy anything after coming all this way, after all. They were about to leave when someone noticed the headcount wasn\u2019t right. \u201cLeader, let\u2019s go\u2014wait, where\u2019s our group leader?\u201d\u201cYu-ge isn\u2019t here, either?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What kind of group leader are you?\u201d\u201cNever mind, never mind. What were you two doing?\u201dEveryone tried to get in a word as if this were a public shaming session.He Zhao said, \u201cAll right, that\u2019s enough.\u201dLuo Wenqiang said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m thirsty. If a certain irresponsible group leader could buy us some\u2026\u201dThis was a fairly blatant hint.He Zhao went off to buy drinks and the others sat on a bench and waited.Xie Yu glanced at the bags in their hands, then looked up at the sign reading Northlake Specialty Store. Through the doorway, he didn\u2019t see any specialty goods at all. Just snacks and desserts. \u201cYou bought souvenirs?\u201d\u201cYes, look, Yu-ge, I bought a scarf.\u201d Liu Cunhao opened his bag and pulled out a red floral-print scarf.Xie Yu was a bit confused. \u201cHow is this local?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s called local goods, but the actual location of production isn\u2019t important. It\u2019s just a psychological thing.\u201dThis lot really was open-minded.When He Zhao returned with drinks, the tour guide was already taking attendance. \u201cIs everyone back? Group leaders, take a headcount.\u201dThere were four to five classes all assembled here and it was terribly noisy.After taking the headcount, the tour guide confirmed no one was missing and they got on the bus back to school.On the bus, Xie Yu continued watching the movie from that morning, and He Zhao reached out to take an earbud.Not long after, He Zhao suddenly said, \u201cHey, can I give you something?\u201dXie Yu was trying to remember what the first half of the movie had been about and didn\u2019t react immediately.He Zhao pulled two bracelets from his pocket.Red string with a red bean threaded through.\u00b9\u201cI saw them while I was getting drinks.\u201d He Zhao seemed a little embarrassed\u2014it was the sort of trinket a little girl might like, after all. He paused, then continued, \u201cLet me know which hand you want it on.\u201dXie Yu looked at it and said, \u201cIt\u2019s a bit girly.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s about who wears it, right?\u201d He Zhao said. \u201cI think neither of us are girly at all.\u201d\u201c\u2026Zhao-ge, can you be less shameless?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s something engraved on it?\u201dXie Yu said it was girly, but took it anyway. On the back of the red bean was engraved a \u2018z.\u2019 A simple English letter but He Zhao had managed to write it messily anyway.He Zhao had been drawn by the store\u2019s signboard. Something about never separating, tying you and your loved one together, and free engraving if you buy today. One-of-a-kind couples\u2019 bracelets.As if inviting praise, He Zhao said, \u201cYeah, I engraved it myself.\u201dXie Yu said, \u201cI know. No one else would do it this terribly.\u201dOn the way back, the bus was not as noisy as it had been on the way here.Everyone was tired from the day\u2019s excursion and had earbuds in, falling asleep while listening to music.At the front of the bus, the tour guide was giving a speech about his thoughts and happiness at having passed the day with Class 3. \u201cIn the sea of people, it\u2019s fate that we got to meet. After today, you\u2019ll go back to school and attend classes again, and I hope that the joy you felt today will accompany you\u2026\u201dXie Yu hesitated for a while and when even He Zhao was convinced his little friend wouldn\u2019t wear it, Xie Yu said, \u201cAll right, because it\u2019s you.\u201dThe bracelet wasn\u2019t too bad-looking. An ordinary red string, no frills.The design was simple and it was not girly when he wore it, after all.Xie Yu\u2019s wrist was slender and fine-boned, and seeing the red string hanging off it made He Zhao\u2019s throat tighten.The engraving on He Zhao\u2019s bracelet was a \u2018y,\u2019 for the \u2018Yu\u2019 in Xie Yu.After putting it on, Xie Yu glanced at He Zhao\u2019s. They looked at each other for a long time, then He Zhao caught hold of Xie Yu\u2019s hand and pushed their wrists together.The bracelets twined together as if they were one.After giving his speech, the tour guide sat down and the bus went completely quiet.All that remained was Luo Wenqiang\u2019s snoring.Xie Yu was in no mood to pay attention to the movie. After watching for a while, he felt sleepy, too, and slowly shut his eyes. He laid his head on He Zhao\u2019s shoulder and fell asleep.All good things must come to an end.In the future when they retrieved this day from their memories, they would remember it as an ordinary, boring day.Old Tang had taught many classes over many years but he never got bored of the spring and fall class trips, even though they happened every semester.He stood up and clumsily took a photo with his phone camera, angling it carefully, capturing an image of a bus full of sleeping students leaning every which way.They slept for a long time on this journey.When Xie Yu next opened his eyes the bus had turned into a side street near Erzhong.Xu Qingqing quietly made a phone call. \u201cHey, mom, I\u2019m almost there. Mm, are you at the school gates?\u201dLuo Wenqiang\u2019s snoring was too loud and Wan Da woke him up. \u201cGym rep! Nearly there!\u201dLuo Wenqiang rubbed the corner of his mouth, and only when he was about to get off the bus did he think of being sad that the trip was over. \u201cAh, we\u2019re here already?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. The class trip is over, but there\u2019s still the weekend, and we can look forward to the long vacation and the winter holidays,\u201d Liu Cunhao said. \u201cThere\u2019s still hope for us all. All right, everyone, we gave out caps this morning, now pass them back. I need to collect them for Old Tang.\u201dThe caps were Erzhong school property. They were distributed because the school worried the students would get lost, or perhaps because one could tell at a glance who was from Erzhong. They were ugly and no one wanted to wear them, but they were handed out on every spring and fall class trip.When He Zhao passed his cap forward, Liu Cunhao caught sight of the streak of red on his wrist. He asked, \u201cZhao-ge, when did you get that bracelet?\u201dWhen Liu Cunhao was done he saw that an identical one hung from Xie Yu\u2019s wrist. He paused, then said, \u201c\u2026Yu-ge, you got one too? It looks quite nice. Is this another exam good luck charm? One that\u2019s been blessed?\u201dHe Zhao: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dXie Yu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWhen the first and second from last students in the year wore couples\u2019 bracelets they were still mistaken for exam good luck charms.\u201cWe\u2019re back\u2014everyone, wake up. Go home if you\u2019re going home and go back to the dorms if you live there. Be careful on the way back,\u201d Old Tang reminded everyone. \u201cGet serious now and do your weekend homework properly.\u201dHe Zhao remembered that Xie Yu had not yet answered his question from before. \u201cAre you going home this weekend?\u201dXie Yu did have to go home that weekend.He had gone to Aunt Mei\u2019s last weekend so if he didn\u2019t spend this weekend with Madam Gu, she wouldn\u2019t say anything but she would be quietly upset.\u201cI\u2019m going back.\u201d Then Xie Yu continued, \u201cHave to go back to appease my mom.\u201dHe Zhao said, \u201cAh.\u201dA while later, he asked, \u201cThen when does my little friend Xie Yu plan to appease his boyfriend?\u201dClass 3 got off the bus.Many parents had gathered around the school gates. Xu Qingqing\u2019s mother had a sunhat on and sat in her electric car chatting with other parents. She pulled an apple from a basket in front of the car, got out, and walked over. \u201cAre you hungry? What did you bring on the class trip? I told you not to eat so many snacks.\u201dThe parents all knew each other. Liu Cunhao had mentioned tearfully in the class group chat that his mom had somehow formed a friendship with Qing-ge\u2019s mom at the school gates.Liu Cunhao and the others walked over and greeted each other\u2019s parents.He Zhao got off the bus and glanced across the road.Xie Yu didn\u2019t need to take anything home\u2014he hadn\u2019t brought back the few sets of clothing he had taken last weekend\u2014but he still followed He Zhao to the dorm buildings.Xie Yu followed He Zhao all the way back to his dorm room before He Zhao realized something was wrong. \u201cYou\u2019re not packing?\u201dXie Yu replied, \u201cI don\u2019t need to bring anything.\u201dHe Zhao was about to ask, \u2018Then what are you doing here?\u2019 when he heard Xie Yu say, \u201cI came to appease my boyfriend before I go.\u201dHe Zhao had wanted to hug him but hadn\u2019t found a suitable location the entire trip.Xie Yu had intended to just hug him for a while before leaving, to appease him, but when they touched he found it was not so easy to leave after all.He Zhao pressed close to him, hands reaching inappropriately through the hem of his school trousers and lowering his head to bite Xie Yu\u2019s neck. \u201cShall I take care of it for you?\u201dXie Yu hummed low in his throat. The sound made He Zhao tighten his hand, almost too hard.Xie Yu\u2019s hands tightened on his bedsheets, muscles taut. The red string on his wrist made his skin look even paler in contrast, a vivid and evocative sight.When He Zhao had bought it, he had never imagined it would look this way on Xie Yu\u2019s wrist.Fuck. He really was going to die.When it was over, Xie Yu let go of the bedsheets, raising a hand to cover his eyes. He Zhao got up to pull a tissue from a box at the head of the bed. He pulled several sheets out and handed them to Xie Yu.The air was thick with the scent of a certain fluid.Xie Yu took it. Cleaning up didn\u2019t seem to be working, so he got up to go back to his own room and change his pants, then remembered that He Zhao was still hard.\u201cI advise you not to touch me,\u201d He Zhao said hoarsely. \u201c\u2026Or you might not get to go back and appease your mom.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d Xie Yu was just about to touch him, but at He Zhao\u2019s words he turned around, holding onto the edge of the bed. He got up and said, completely disaffected \u201cThanks, then. Take a cold shower to cool off.\u201dWhen Xie Yu walked out of school towards the bus stop, the school gates were nearly deserted.On the bus, he called Madam Gu, who happily said \u201cSure, sure, sure,\u201d on the other end of the line.Then Madam Gu asked, \u201cDid you have a good time on the class trip? Are you hungry? What do you want to eat when you get back?\u201d\u201cIt was fine. Just as expected,\u201d Xie Yu said. \u201cAnything is fine.\u201dWhen Xie Yu hung up he realized that He Zhao practically never went home on weekends.He Zhao\u2019s mother was overseas but Xie Yu had never heard He Zhao mention his father.How magnanimous did a parent have to be to not be worried when their child got grades like He Zhao\u2019s?Xie Yu kept thinking about it, then sent a text to He Zhao who should have finished his shower by now. Are you done showering?He Zhao replied very quickly:No.It won\u2019t go down while I\u2019m thinking of you.\u2026\u2026Xie Yu got to the station before He Zhao finished his shower. He toweled his hair dry while calling Xie Yu. \u201cAre you home yet?\u201dXie Yu got off the bus and said as he walked, \u201cYou sure take long showers.\u201dHe Zhao laughed quietly. \u201cMm. It was long.\u201dIgnoring the teasing, Xie Yu asked, \u201cYou aren\u2019t going home?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no one at home. What do I need to go home for?\u201d He Zhao sat on his bed, pulling the cap off a pen with his teeth. He flipped open a textbook and said, \u201cMy dad is overseas for work. He\u2019s rarely home.\u201d\u201cHe doesn\u2019t worry about you?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that he doesn\u2019t worry. He just wants me to think about it for myself, and whatever I want to do, he won\u2019t stop me.\u201dHe Zhao thought his dad was someone hard to come by, too. When he had said he didn\u2019t want to take the high school exams, he had been allowed to do so. Then when he stayed at home after quitting school, his dad hadn\u2019t lectured him about it, either. He had just done the cost-benefit analysis with He Zhao and then let him make his own decision.All he said was, \u201cHe Zhao, your life is your own.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m here. Later.\u201d\u201cMm.\u201dHe Zhao had said, \u201cMm,\u201d but he didn\u2019t hang up.Xie Yu stood in the doorway, leaning against the wall, and was tickled. \u201cIf I don\u2019t hang up, then are you not going to hang up?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m hanging up,\u201d He Zhao said. \u201cGo in.\u201dXie Yu had just entered and changed his shoes when Gu Xuelan pushed a plate of fruit into his hands. She said gravely, \u201cGo and sit on the sofa and eat this. Dinner will be ready soon.\u201dThe fruits were cut up neatly, several varieties arranged on a glass plate.Xie Yu speared two pieces with a toothpick and ate them, then walked over and leaned against the doorway, watching her.Gu Xuelan cut up the vegetables, washed her hands, then turned and caught sight of Xie Yu\u2019s wrist accessory. \u201cWhen did you get that?\u201dXie Yu followed her eyes downward to his wrist. He said, \u201cAh, this\u2026 I got it on the class trip.\u201dGu Xuelan didn\u2019t think any more of it. She knew Xie Yu better than anyone. He didn\u2019t interact much with others. So she said, \u201cWhen you were little I bought you a gold pendant but you didn\u2019t like wearing it, and when I put it around your neck you cried\u201dXie Yu said nothing.Zhong Guofei had come back early tonight and the three of them ate dinner together. The dinner table was quiet, and Xie Yu had no interest in Madam Gu telling Zhong Guofei about Madam Chen or Madam Lu. He ate a little, then got up to go upstairs.Gu Xuelan asked, \u201cWon\u2019t you eat some more?\u201dXie Yu said, \u201cNo need. I\u2019m full. You all continue.\u201dSoon, Xie Yu found that when he was alone he kept thinking about a certain idiot\u2019s excavator-piloting future.He had seen He Zhao\u2019s midterm papers. It wasn\u2019t completely hopeless. He Zhao had answered several questions correctly, the ones which Old Wu had gone over multiple times in class that if anyone still got wrong might have caused him to expire from anger.Xie Yu thought about it, then turned on his PC and opened a Word document, then typed out: Content summary for the college exams.11 p.m.He Zhao was in his dorm room doing mock exam papers when a notification popped up on his phone screen.\u2014You have 1 new message.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It\u2019s pointless.The subject line of the email read: Face the college exams and escape low scores.He Zhao put his pen down and glanced at the sender field. He didn\u2019t know them. The QQ email account was newly created, and not on his friends list.His first thought was that it was spam.When school had started, He Zhao had put down his own phone number as the parental contact number.Who knew where after-school tutors got students\u2019 personal information. Every few days he received annoying texts, and the advertisements got even more aggressive during exam season. Hello, parent of He Zhao. This is XXX College Exam Prep Class. We understand how your child is doing in school and sincerely recommend our 80-day boot camp. Our capable teachers will tutor your child one-on-one\u2026At the entrance to Erzhong, various tutoring organizations also distributed flyers and occasionally conducted surveys.The last time he had gone out with Xie Yu to eat, he had run into one.Several people holding clipboards stood at the gates, looking around. Seeing the two students emerge from the restaurant around the corner, they had approached. \u201cHello, can you\u2026\u201dXie Yu instantly replied, \u201cNo.\u201dThey had stood there stunned for a while. They had probably never met someone like him.Nevertheless, they refused to give up, and tried again. \u201cIf we could have a moment, we are\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to know,\u201d Xie Yu said. \u201cCan you move? You\u2019re blocking the road.\u201dRemembering this, He Zhao wanted to laugh again. He thought, My little friend must be salespeople\u2019s worst nightmare.He didn\u2019t even give them a chance to finish.He really was chilly.He Zhao opened the email expecting it to be spam, but it was not quite the 80-day boot camp advertisement he had expected.\u2014It really was an email containing study materials.Without a single word of advertisement.The email consisted of several sections organized by subject, covering the contents on the main exam. The guides were very straightforward and logical, without a single unnecessary word.He Zhao glanced at it twice and didn\u2019t notice anything complicated. It looked like a guide for bad students to learn the basics.In sum, this was a near-perfect foundational guide.Xie Yu had stayed up all night compiling the critical points of each subject for He Zhao and was about to go to sleep, but his head had just hit the pillow when the class group chat exploded again.At the head of his bed, his phone vibrated several times.[He Zhao]: @v=s*h, study rep, what are you doing?[v=s*h ]: I\u2019m memorizing English words.[Luo Wenqiang]: Study rep, what time is it? You\u2019re still fighting?[v=s*h ]: It\u2019s still early. You sleep so early? I can\u2019t sleep, and the more I read the more energy I have.[Luo Wenqiang]: All right, that\u2019s enough. You\u2019re the most impressive.[He Zhao]: No, I mean what did you email me in the middle of the night for?Xue Xisheng had no idea what was happening.[v=s*h ]: What email?[He Zhao]: Study guide?[v=s*h]\uff1a\uff1f[He Zhao]: What\u2019s that question mark for? It wasn\u2019t you?The mysterious study guide incited a burst of enthusiasm in everyone from Class 3. It was the middle of the night but they all didn\u2019t sleep, looking instead at He Zhao\u2019s screenshot and letting their imaginations run wild.[Liu Cunhao]: Might it be Old Wu?[Xu Qingqing]: No, Old Wu wouldn\u2019t make a new email. He would have just sent it.[Liu Cunhao]: Shall we just ask him? @Mr. Wu ZhengAfter ruling out the study rep and the math teacher, none of them knew who else in their class would do such a thing.[Wan Da]: Maybe it\u2019s like this\u2026Eventually, they came up with a story of a besotted girl who had had a crush on He Zhao for a long time. She couldn\u2019t have him, but loved him to death and had watched him from afar.[Xu Qingqing]: That\u2019s definitely it. And from the study guide we can see that this girl gets good grades. Very logical. For instance, the explanation for this example is very structured.[Wan Da]: Yes, yes. Her love, usually repressed in her heart, finally bursts forth on a thoughtful night like this![He Zhao]: Ah, is that so.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Xie Yu, lying on his bed, put one hand to his forehead. He forced out, \u201cIdiot.\u201d He wasn\u2019t sure if he was cursing He Zhao or himself.After Xu Qingqing and the others had analyzed it, this strange and twisted love story really did sound like it could be true.Xie Yu had not completed the study guide and had only sent He Zhao the basics. Although Class 3\u2019s imagination left him speechless, he continued to write the study guide.The examples and facts in the basics version were not nearly sufficient. The college exams were much more difficult than that.The next day, after Xie Yu got out of bed, he made another guide.As with the previous document, the guide was divided into sections. It covered several common trap questions and the various ways a single content point could be tested.\u201cDon\u2019t stay in your room all day.\u201d Near noon, Madam Gu knocked on his door. \u201cCome downstairs for lunch.\u201dXie Yu said, still typing, \u201cGot it.\u201dGu Xuelan sighed. \u201cGot it, got it\u2026 I don\u2019t think you get it at all.\u201dMadam Gu waited outside the door for a while. Xie Yu saved the document and used the same QQ email account from before to send the file to He Zhao.[Email sent successfully.]At lunch, Gu Xuelan kept pressing the topic. \u201cWhat are you doing in your room?\u201dXie Yu took a piece of pork rib and put it in Gu Xuelan\u2019s bowl, then said, \u201cStudying.\u201d\u201cAs if.\u201dAfter passing over the pork rib, Xie Yu took some of a vegetable dish for himself and said nothing more.He was always like that. Although he never studied, he always made the excuse that he was studying.He always said that he wasn\u2019t coming home on weekends because he wanted to focus on studying in school. And then his grades were second from last in the year anyway. Who knew what on earth he had been studying.Gu Xuelan eventually concluded, Forget it. The meal would be ruined if they kept talking about it.Xie Yu finished his lunch, went back upstairs, and was about to log out of the QQ account when he saw a little red dot next to his inbox.He opened it and saw a new email.The subject line was five words: Don\u2019t love me. It\u2019s pointless.Sender: He Zhao.The body of the email was even more of the same, something along the lines of, \u201cI already have a partner.\u201dI have a very close relationship with my partner.Friend, I don\u2019t know who you are, but I hope you understand that it\u2019s impossible between us.Do you understand what I\u2019m saying?It seemed that He Zhao had absorbed every word Xu Qingqing and the others had said yesterday.Xie Yu sat in front of the computer staring at the rejection letter for a long time, unsure how to react.\u201cDamn.\u201d Xie Yu closed out of the page, then murmured to himself, \u201c\u2026I\u2019m that partner.\u201dHe Zhao was usually so annoying Xie Yu was very tempted to block him, but he was quieter this weekend.Xie Yu accompanied Madam Gu to a nearby park for a walk. They didn\u2019t have much to talk about, so he mentioned some things from class and Madam Gu seemed quite happy.It was past 1pm when he next got a call from He Zhao.\u201cI held it in for very long before I called you.\u201d It was noisy on He Zhao\u2019s end of the phone\u2014he was probably outside. \u201cThought you mightn\u2019t be up yet.\u201dXie Yu stepped into his room and leaned against the door. \u201cWhat do you think I am, sleeping until this time of day?\u201d\u201cA pig?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re the damn pig.\u201d\u201cAll right,\u201d He Zhao said. \u201cI\u2019m a pig.\u201dThey chatted for a while and Xie Yu heard someone on He Zhao\u2019s end say, \u201c68 yuan. Cash or credit?\u201dHe Zhao was holding his phone and couldn\u2019t scan a QR code, so he reached into his pocket and said, \u201cCash, and can I have a bag? Thank you.\u201dXie Yu waited for him to pay before asking, \u201cYou went out?\u201d\u201cMm.\u201d He Zhao stood in the bookshop, two copies of The Complete Guide to the College Exams on the counter. He had shopped around for a long time before carefully selecting this extra-curricular study material for his boyfriend. He said vaguely, \u201c\u2026Came out to buy something.\u201dXie Yu thought that He Zhao was probably at a convenience store getting something to eat. Not many students stayed at Erzhong over the weekend and only one stall was open at the cafeteria, offering a small selection of food. Probably incomparable to home cooking.Students who stayed over the weekend usually went out to eat or bought some instant noodles and snacks to tide them over.The cashier counted out He Zhao\u2019s change, put the books in the bag, and gave both to He Zhao.He Zhao pushed open the door, carrying the bags, and glanced down at the red string on his wrist. He asked Xie Yu, \u201cAre you still wearing the bracelet?\u201dXie Yu glanced at his own wrist. The red string still hung there, the red bean with the Z carved on it resting on his wristbone. \u201cYes. What about it?\u201d\u201cNothing, just asking.\u201dAlthough they weren\u2019t physically together, strangely, linked by the red line, they both felt that the other was near.As if they were breathing the same air.The weekend passed quickly and it was Monday again.Xie Yu glanced at the time as he waited for the bus back to school. It was that time of morning when \u2018Loyalty to the Country\u2019 would usually resound through the air. He then thought of Dean Jiang\u2019s daily encouraging speech which had never skipped a day and the daily groans of misery that echoed through the dorm building.Xie Yu thought about it, then called He Zhao.\u201cAre you awake?\u201d\u201cHow can I sleep?\u201d He Zhao had been freshly woken by the broadcast and his voice was still hoarse. He sat up and asked, \u201cYou\u2019re on the bus? When do you get back?\u201dBefore Xie Yu left, Madam Gu had pushed a can of milk into his hands and made him promise to drink it on the bus to aid nutrition. The milk was still warm and he bit on the straw as he said, \u201c\u2026Half an hour.\u201dXie Yu\u2019s voice was muffled and gentle, a little soft.He Zhao asked, \u201cAre you eating something?\u201dXie Yu said, \u201cDrinking milk.\u201dThinking it sounded strange, Xie Yu added, \u201cCow\u2019s milk.\u201dHe Zhao cursed on the other end of the line.Xie Yu asked, \u201cAre you sick?\u201dHe Zhao replied, \u201cDoes morning wood count as sick?\u201dAs a guy, He Zhao was prone to specific biological reactions. He was imagining his little friend quietly drinking milk and gave himself a hard time.When Xie Yu got to the classroom, He Zhao had not yet arrived.Wan Da and the others had arrived early and were huddled together, copying homework. No one dared leave any questions blank, so even if they copied only the formula steps, they still wrote something for every question. Wan Da glanced up, saw Xie Yu, and greeted him. \u201cYu-ge, you\u2019re early\u2026 where\u2019s Zhao-ge?\u201dXie Yu said, walking to the back row, \u201cHe\u2019s taking a shower.\u201dWan Da asked, \u201cShowering at this time?\u201dXie Yu was about to go on, but then he saw the two copies of The Complete Guide to the College Exams on his desk and stopped. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWhat the hell was this?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

On the covers, in bold red letters, was printed: Bad grades? Don\u2019t worry! The right guidebook is the key to success!Wan Da copied two questions, closed his exercise book, then continued fretting about He Zhao showering in the morning. \u201cYou and He Zhao both seem to take a lot of showers. Last time, too\u2026 are you two germophobes?\u201dHe then remembered Xie Yu\u2019s words, \u2018None of your business,\u2019 and stopped.Xie Yu stood by the desk, flipping through the books, and noticed that the slogan on the cover was genuine.This guidebook was well-written. It covered content in detail and had thorough explanations of the examples and revision questions. One could grasp the class material just by reading it.\u201cWhose is this?\u201d Xie Yu\u2019s fingers stilled on the contents page. There was no name written in the book and Xie Yu thought it suspicious. Maybe someone had accidentally left it there. \u201cTake it back.\u201dLiu Cunhao was erasing the blackboard. Hearing this, he turned around, still holding the washcloth. \u201cWhat is it?\u201dWan Da was a busybody who went anywhere there was trouble, and immediately ran over. He sat in the empty seat in front of Xie Yu\u2019s desk and observed. \u201cBooks? Yu-ge, aren\u2019t these yours?\u201dXie Yu retorted, \u201cDoes this look like something of mine?\u201dWan Da: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dXie Yu could not be refuted.The two skilled \u2018bottom-of-the-class\u2019 students never did their homework. Their textbooks were as pristine as they day they received them; they had never touched them, and the books were still like new.Aside from textbooks, they didn\u2019t have any even remotely study-related things.Xie Yu\u2019s desk was clean and empty. He Zhao\u2019s occasionally contained lollipop wrappers.When teachers lectured, Xie Yu and He Zhao never had their worksheets on hand, always missing something or otherdelivered the material, they never had their papers on hand, always missing one or the other. When they were lucky, they were missing different parts and could share, so they listened to class together.All the subject teachers were mad at them. \u201c\u2014What\u2019s wrong with you two? Can\u2019t you hold onto your worksheets properly?\u201d\u201cI was the first in here today and I didn\u2019t see anyone come in.\u201d Liu Cunhao also thought someone might have misplaced their books. \u201cWhen everyone\u2019s here we can ask about it again.\u201dBut when the class had all arrived and Xie Yu took the books around, asking again, no one claimed them.Liu Cunhao, watching him, thought that he would make a good class rep, actually. He was very intimidating. He stood on the podium, glanced around the class, and they instantly went quiet.\u201cOne last time,\u201d Xie Yu said. \u201cWhose are these?\u201dXu Qingqing shook her head. \u201cDon\u2019t look at me. I don\u2019t know. They\u2019re not mine.\u201dLuo Wenqiang had bought his own copy a long time ago and made many markings on it, and as he went on about it, he strayed off topic. \u201cThis is a good guidebook. My home tutor recommended it to me, and I really think everyone should get it. You just need to flip through it for a while, and then, like me, you\u2019ll fall in love with it.\u201dXie Yu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe Zhao arrived as class was about to start.Seeing a crowd around the back row, he wondered what they were talking about.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d He Zhao crooked a finger and knocked on the door. \u201cSuch a ruckus so early in the morning.\u201dXie Yu had gotten a headache from the noise this lot was making. Hearing He Zhao, he propped his forehead with his hand and glanced backward.He Zhao wore a thin sweater inside his school jacket. His hair was still damp, a charging cord in hand as he leaned against the doorframe. He had folded his sleeves up, revealing his wrists.For a moment, their gazes met in the air.When Xie Yu\u2019s eyes met He Zhao\u2019s, the noise around him suddenly grew faraway.It had been only a weekend, but He Zhao felt that a long time had passed. He didn\u2019t hold the thought for long before Xie Yu said, \u201cI don\u2019t know which idiot put books on my desk.\u201dHe Zhao: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cZhao-ge, do you know where these books came from?\u201d Wan Da looked up and asked.He Zhao said, \u201cAh?\u201dWan Da said, \u201cNo one comes to the classrooms on weekends, and the doors and windows are always locked. How did these two books get here?\u201dAlthough the classroom door had been locked, one of the windows didn\u2019t have a secure fastening and could be opened easily by pushing it upwards.He Zhao, who had climbed through the window and placed the books on the desk, was unsure how to react. \u201cAh\u2026\u201dWan Da and the others kept guessing along the same lines as before. \u201cIf it\u2019s not Old Tang, it\u2019s someone with a crush on Yu-ge. Maybe they were unsure what gifts to give him, thinking chocolate and things like that aren\u2019t novel enough, and after thinking about it for a long time, only The Complete Guide to the College Exams\u2026\u201dHe Zhao: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAs Wan Da went on, he found that this story sounded very familiar. He slapped his forehead. \u201cIsn\u2019t this very like Zhao-ge\u2019s email? Might they besisters?\u201dA vein throbbed at Xie Yu\u2019s forehead.Before Wan Da could put the email and the study guide side by side to analyze, the class bell rang and everyone returned to their seats.He Zhao let out a breath.Xie Yu put the study guides at the side of his desk.\u201cGoing by your mid-term grades, you lost many points on reading comprehension. We\u2019ll read several passages today for practice. Finish them in class, then we\u2019ll go over them.\u201d Old Tang distributed the worksheets, then said, \u201cAnalyze the questions carefully. If you run into issues, try to understand why.\u201dXie Yu took the paper the classmate in front passed him, then handed He Zhao one, too. Then he put both arms over the paper and lay down to sleep.He Zhao nudged him. \u201cOld Xie.\u201dXie Yu asked, \u201cWhat?\u201dHe Zhao wasn\u2019t sure what to say, so he held his pen tighter and said, \u201cThat\u2026 book.\u201dXie Yu thought He Zhao was jealous. He Zhao often got so jealous over small things he could flip vinegar jars for days.\u00b9 Even for a simple game, he warned Xie Yu not to pick dare.Xie Yu thought about it and thought he understood He Zhao\u2019s intentions. \u201cI won\u2019t keep it.\u201dHe Zhao said, \u201c\u2026Then where are you going to put it?\u201dXie Yu wanted to give his boyfriend a sense of security and there was no point in keeping it, anyway. Might as well take it to get a refund. \u201cI\u2019ll toss it.\u201dThey went over three modern readings during the class period. Old Tang kept picking He Zhao to answer questions.Xie Yu slept through half the class period. When he next opened his eyes he heard Old Tang say, \u201cHe Zhao, stand up and answer this. How did you answer this question\u2014Why was the author crying?\u201dHe Zhao stood up, but before he said anything Wan Da and the others had already started to laugh.Old Tang said, \u201cWhat are you all laughing about?\u201dBravely, Liu Cunhao answered, \u201cWe\u2019ll laugh before he even says anything, to show him respect.\u201dHe Zhao did not let Liu Cunhao and the others down. He analyzed the author\u2019s tears from many angles: perhaps he had a fragile psychology, because real men didn\u2019t cry easily, or perhaps he had an eye infection\u2026 He Zhao thought of even the most subtle reasons.When He Zhao was done, the class was silent for several minutes, then erupted into laughter. \u201cZhao-ge, you really never let us down.\u201dHe Zhao: \u201cHigh praise, high praise.\u201dXie Yu rubbed his temples in despair.\u201cCome to my office when you have some time.\u201d Old Tang was in even more despair than Xie Yu; he almost couldn\u2019t breathe. He drank some wolfberry tea and paused for a while before continuing, \u201cAnd bring your paper with you.\u201dWhen Old Tang said \u201cCome by when you have some time,\u201d everyone made the excuse that they didn\u2019t have time in order not to go.No one wanted to go to the faculty office and dragged it out as long as they could. Perhaps when the earth was old and the sky was barren, Old Tang himself would have forgotten.After class, He Zhao and some of the guys from the next row grabbed some of Luo Wenqiang\u2019s dry noodle snacksand Luo Wenqiang nearly jumped up and started beating them up. \u201cAre you done?! If you keep taking, there\u2019ll be none left.\u201dHe Zhao had broken off a piece and now reached out for more.Luo Wenqiang said, \u201cYou\u2019re all bandits!\u201dHe Zhao said, breaking some more off, \u201cMy deskmate, too.\u201dXie Yu had just finished a round on his phone game and happened to hear He Zhao. He put his phone in his pocket, got up, and walked over.Luo Wenqiang thought finally someone with a conscience had arrived and begged him, \u201cYu-ge, save me.\u201dXie Yu pushed up his sleeves and said to He Zhao, \u201cYou broke it into too many pieces. I\u2019ll get some myself.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Luo Wenqiang had an expression of pure shock. \u201cYou two are bandit deskmates?!\u201dHe Zhao, who should have gone to the faculty office, didn\u2019t go, but Wan Da went.At any sign of movement, Know-It-All would even stoop to knocking at the door with worksheet in hand and asking for homework help in order to get some news.By this time, when Old Wu and the others saw him with a worksheet in hand, they always joked, \u201cYou\u2019re really here for help?\u201dAfter Luo Wenqiang\u2019s dry noodles had made its rounds, Wan Da returned from the office. \u201cThere will be an arts festival soon,\u201d he said, reaching for the bag of dry noodles. \u201cEvery class has to come up with a theme. Arts rep, prepare yourself. We have to win this race.\u201dClass 3\u2019s arts rep was a girl who had danced since a young age and she was quite excited at the news. \u201cReally?\u201dWan Da said, \u201cThe school anniversary is two weeks from now. It\u2019s definitely true.\u201dAt the subject of the arts festival, the class got noisy again. Only Luo Wenqiang held on to the dregs of his dry noodles in the bag and was quietly sad.For an event like this, most classes would pick a dozen or so people to dance, sing, or hold a skit. With so many people looking on, they had to put on a good show. They couldn\u2019t lose out on making their presence felt.The arts rep had already begun selecting class representatives. He Zhao turned and asked, \u201cGoing, Old Xie?\u201dXie Yu didn\u2019t even consider it. \u201cNope.\u201d\u201cWhy not?\u201d He Zhao remembered the black nail polish incident and the days when Xie Yu\u2019s reputation was carried on the winds of this story. \u201cYou have experience, don\u2019t you? That competition on your street\u2026\u201dXie Yu said, \u201cDon\u2019t mention it or I\u2019ll punch you.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Not everyone gets a chance like that.\u201dXie Yu looked at him and slowly pushed his sleeves up his forearms, then rotated his wrists. \u201cAre you sure you want to keep talking about this?\u201dThe meaning was obvious: Keep goddamn talking and you\u2019ll die where you stand.He Zhao kept asking, \u201cDid everyone cheer when you went on stage?\u201d\u201cDid you win anything?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dLiu Cunhao and the others were still writing down their names and discussing songs at the same time. Before they had decided on a song, they heard a crash from the back row.The sound of someone kicking over a chair was very familiar.\u201cOh.\u201d Liu Cunhao glanced backwards, then said calmly, \u201cIgnore them. Let\u2019s continue.\u201dLuo Wenqiang scratched his head and mumbled, \u201cDid I miss something? I feel like they fight less these days.\u201dAnd whenever they were together there seemed to be an invisible barrier separating them from their surroundings.It was a very subtle feeling, and no one could pinpoint just exactly what was strange about it.Xie Yu was not tactful in the least. He Zhao took several blows before catching hold of Xie Yu\u2019s wrist, and nearly tripped over the chair as he moved back. \u201cYou\u2019re really hitting me?\u201dThen he added in a whisper, \u201cYou\u2019re really hitting your boyfriend?\u201dXie Yu bent down, picked up the chair on the floor, and pushed it out of his way. \u201cYou asked for it.\u201dDuring lunch break, Old Tang came to distribute the homework and inform everyone of the arts festival.\u201cI have something to tell you\u2014next week is the school anniversary. Wan Da has probably already told you.\u201d Laughter erupted from below. Old Tang paused, then continued, \u201cEvery class has to prepare a performance. Everyone, sign up, and let\u2019s put together a skit or something\u2014Xu Jing, you take care of it.\u201dThe arts rep, hearing her name, raised her hand and said, \u201cWill do, Mr. Tang.\u201dXie Yu had no interest in the performing arts and his previous experience of dancing on stage had already left a heavy black mark on his heart. It ranked among the top three most embarrassing experiences of his life.While Old Tang was talking, he was slumped on his desk, sleeping, and didn\u2019t notice that the arts rep was now eyeing him and He Zhao.Secretly, Xu Jing wanted the two of them to lead the performance.They were the face of Class 3, after all, so their appearance would definitely make waves.The performances would be graded by the teachers, and since Class 3 was participating they definitely wanted to do well.\u201cWill He Zhao want to participate?\u201dAfter Old Tang left, several of them put their heads together. After Xu Jing asked this, Liu Cunhao banged on the table and said, \u201cOf course he will. No need to even ask. Look at Zhao-ge! So radiant, and making waves wherever he stands. The world is his stage.\u201dThen Xu Jing asked, \u201cWhat about Xie Yu?\u201dLiu Cunhao fell silent.Luo Wenqiang considered it. \u201cThat\u2026 that is a little more difficult. How about someone else? How about me? My coordination is quite good.\u201dWan Da said, \u201cDifficult is an understatement\u2026 you might want to start thinking about which cemetery you want to lie in after you\u2019re dead.\u201dThey discussed it until class was about to begin, then they went downstairs to the quad and lined up. They still had not come to a conclusion.Gym class was still free activity. Since the basketball team no longer welcomed He Zhao and refused to let him play with them no matter what, He Zhao went over to Xu Qingqing\u2019s side and collected two badminton rackets. \u201cOld Xie, coming?\u201dXie Yu took one of the rackets. It was just badminton. Back and forth, He Zhao wouldn\u2019t be able to play any of his tricks. \u201cAre we going to the stadium?\u201d\u201cIf there\u2019s room,\u201d He Zhao said. \u201cIf not, outside\u2019s fine, too.\u201dThe stadium was packed with shuttlecocks flying through the air, and the rest areas on both sides were also packed. Xie Yu walked all the way to the end of the hall before finding an empty space.They stood on either end.He Zhao unzipped his jacket, making the first show of strength.He was just done bragging when a brutal smash from Xie Yu flew diagonally across the court at him. \u201cCut the crap.\u201dXu Qingqing had not found a spot to play badminton, so she sat to the side, and the arts rep approached her to help pick songs.All three songs she picked were very upbeat and would get the school going.\u201cListen and tell me which you like,\u201d Xu Jing said. \u201cWan Da and the others think the second song is best. I think we should decide today. Ah, I really want to ask Xie Yu to participate\u2026 but I don\u2019t dare to.\u201dXu Qingqing couldn\u2019t decide and said \u201cI think they\u2019re all good.\u201d She heard the crowd begin to murmur around her, so she pulled out her earphones and looked up only to catch sight of the two Big Bros playing badminton in the corner.Although they were standing at the far end of the hall, they were still the most eye-catching of the lot.On the class trip they had joked that their Zhao-ge was the one person who would never be lost, because anyone would recognize him just from his silhouette.Many people around them were also looking on, saying behind their hands, \u201cSo cool.\u201dSomeone else said, \u201cBut they\u2019re playing so brutally.\u201dXie Yu played badminton just like he beat people up. When he jumped up to smash the shuttlecock, his chilly and sharp aura could hit you in the face.He Zhao had not been prepared at first and Xie Yu\u2019s smash nearly defeated him. But he reacted quickly, analyzed where the ball would land, retreated several steps on instinct, and managed to return the serve.They hit the shuttlecock back and forth, running a little farther each time.Xie Yu, especially, played like his life depended on it.\u201cDamn.\u201d Seeing how Xie Yu was playing, He Zhao was forced to play seriously, too. He took off his jacket and threw it to the ground. \u201cYou\u2019re aggressive, little friend.\u201d\u201cSo-so.\u201dThe air circulation was bad in the indoor stadium and Xie Yu felt breathless, so he unzipped his own jacket and said, \u201cJust a bit stronger than you.\u201dXie Yu had never gotten used to playing sports with Dalei and the others. Dalei had always said, \u201cAre you playing the game or are you fighting? We have to coordinate, you know? We\u2019re a team. Boss Xie, if I invite you along the next goddamn time you can call me a dog.\u201dBut after Dalei had slept on it, he forgot all about it and brought his ball with him the next day anyway. \u201cLet\u2019s go. Basketball. I invited Xiao-hu from the next street over, too. We\u2019ll have it out today.\u201dAll the kids of similar age in this area had formed basketball teams. Probably influenced by the movies, they also liked to give themselves ridiculous nicknames.Little Tiger Army, Black Bull Army\u2026The game was well underway and Xie Yu was starting to sweat, so he took off his own jacket. While He Zhao was picking up the shuttlecock, he bent at the waist and pulled at his collar, fanning himself.The light sweater Xie Yu was wearing inside was loose-fitting, and when he raised his arm to catch the shuttlecock, the material followed his movements, faintly outlining his waist.Following that line of sight, He Zhao could also see his defined collarbones, and beneath that\u2026Xie Yu was still waiting for He Zhao to toss the shuttlecock over, but He Zhao just said, \u201cI\u2019m done.\u201dXie Yu\u2019s hand was still on his collar. \u201cAh?\u201dHe Zhao said, \u201cYou broke the rules.\u201dBroke the rules, my ass.What rule did I break?Before Xie Yu could figure it out, He Zhao had already called Xu Qingqing to take his place. \u201cQing-ge, you didn\u2019t find a spot, right? Come on.\u201dXu Qinqing and Xu Jing walked over, carrying their rackets.Xu Jing was still thinking about the arts program. She plucked up her courage and asked Xie Yu, \u201cHey, Classmate Xie, will you perform with us at the arts festival? You can pick your role. Center stage is fine, if you want\u2026\u201dXie Yu was putting his jacket back on.He didn\u2019t really remember who this girl was. Despite being classmates for so long, he didn\u2019t even remember her name.But the girl was watching him, both attentive and hopeful. Her clear eyes shone brightly.Although she seemed scared, she still stood in front of him and said her piece.Xu Qingqing stood beside He Zhao. Seeing that Xu Jing really had approached Xie Yu, she said in surprise, \u201cWith Yu-ge\u2019s personality\u2026 does Jing-jing want to die? Everyone knows he won\u2019t do it.\u201dBut He Zhao smiled and said, \u201cThat\u2019s not a given.\u201dThey were too far away to hear what Xie Yu and Xu Jing were saying. Xie Yu finished saying his piece, zipped his jacket closed, and carried his badminton racket over.Xie Yu tossed the racket to He Zhao. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dHe Zhao caught it and waved to Xu Qingqing. \u201cSee you, Qing-ge.\u201dXu Qingqing waved back, stunned, then walked up and leaned against the net dividing the court in two. \u201cHow did it go? What did Yu-ge say?\u201dXu Jing hadn\u2019t recovered, either. She didn\u2019t answer the question, but said, \u201cCan you pinch me?\u201dDoes that mean he agreed?Xu Jing said, \u201cHe agreed, I guess. Although he was very cold about it. He said, \u201cWhatever.\u201d\u201dThe participant name list quickly reached Old Tang\u2019s hands. Old Tang was very vehement that their participation was the important thing and how they ranked in the competition was secondary. They started rehearsals during class time.Class 3 had a specific temperament: Although they didn\u2019t dance well, they were all immersed in their own performance and all thought themselves very cool.Besides, He Zhao was leading them, so the classroom had become their stage.Only Xie Yu still sat in his seat. After learning the moves, he stepped aside and watched the others go mad.He Zhao, done making a scene, stood next to him.Xie Yu drank half of a bottle of water, then handed it to He Zhao. \u201cKing of the stage, you\u2019re not dancing any more?\u201dHe Zhao gulped the water, wiped his mouth with his hand, then said, \u201cThey learn very. The students surpass the teacher, really.\u201dXie Yu had disliked the commotion just now and put his earbuds in. Now, taking them out, he found that they had inherited He Zhao\u2019s attitude. Anywhere there was an audience, was their stage.Liu Cunhao: \u201cWe\u2019re the Coolest Guy Group in the Universe!\u201dWan Da \u201cFriends over here, put your hands in the air!\u201dLuo Wenqiang: \u201cYou\u2019re not loud enough! Make some more noise!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dOld Wu was carrying his study materials into class, and this threefold shout made him jump. Thinking for a moment that he had entered the wrong classroom, he retreated several paces, made sure the sign on the door said Class 2.3, then said, \u201cWhat are you doing?! Are you going to make your debut? All this nonsense about this coolest guy group in the universe.\u201dClass began. Everyone calmed down and paid attention.Old Wu finished explaining a concept, then started giving out homework. Something seemed to occur to him and he picked up his chalk again. \u201cThere is a little more to this concept. I\u2019ll explain it. You might not understand, and if that\u2019s the case, that\u2019s fine. Don\u2019t worry about it. Just do the parts you know how to do.\u201dXie Yu looked up at the blackboard. Old Wu was explaining a question format that touched on several content points, with quite a novel approach.Most of the students had glanced at the question and immediately given up on it.Xie Yu read the question, then took out his phone to draft an answer on his notes application, but discovered that He Zhao, who had been playing a game all class period, was also looking at the blackboard.He Zhao was still holding his phone, a game interface on the screen. The avatar named \u2018Handsome He\u2019 was currently being slaughtered by a dungeon boss and lost all its health.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After doing the arithmetic, he considered several ways of approaching the question.The concept Old Wu had explained in class was quite straightforward, but even simple concepts became more complicated when they were tested using functions.He Zhao wanted to grab a piece of scratch paper and draft an answer.Xie Yu glanced at He Zhao and noticed that he was looking at the blackboard even more intently than he had been looking at his game.He Zhao wasn\u2019t very enthusiastic about gaming. He tapped here and there but didn\u2019t get invested.Rather than liking gaming, it seemed more that he was bored and had nothing to do.But he was good at the game and had a lot of tricks up his sleeve. During evening self-study, Wan Da and the others often invited He Zhao to play with them, or asked him which server he was on.He Zhao always responded, \u201cI\u2019m not playing with you today. I\u2019m playing a couples\u2019 formation with my deskmate.\u201dWan Da doggedly kept on inviting him, hoping to get a good player on his team. \u201cYu-ge? That\u2019s more like a solo suicide mission, right? Don\u2019t you want to play in an actual team?\u201dXie Yu finally reached out and tapped on He Zhao\u2019s phone screen.On the game interface, \u2018Handsome He\u2019 dodged an attack and swung his sword in a counterattack before running off to the side, still trailing blood.Xie Yu retracted his hand, then asked, \u201cWhat were you thinking so hard about?\u201d\u201cLook at these conditions to determine the boundaries of the question.\u201d Old Wu laid out the critical points and drew a diagram, then rapped on the blackboard with a ruler. \u201cTake a few minutes to think about this\u2026\u201dOld Wu wanted to call someone up to the blackboard to solve the question, but glancing around the class he found that only Xue Xisheng was actively trying to do the question. He said, \u201cStudy rep, come up and solve it.\u201dXue Xisheng pushed up his glasses, got up, walked to the blackboard, and wrote the word \u2018Solution:\u2019 practically tucked away in the upper left corner of the board.He Zhao quickly gave his avatar a healing potion and fell silent.Surely, he couldn\u2019t say, Old Xie, this extension question is quite simple. In the last minute, I thought of three different ways to solve it. Do you want to hear them?Thankfully, Xie Yu didn\u2019t keep asking.Xie Yu wrote down several solution steps in his notes app, ordered his thoughts, then deleted the note. He opened his calculator app and started to do the arithmetic.Neither of them were well-versed in love, but many of their peers had gotten into relationships early.Based on Wan Da\u2019s rumors alone, all the couples in school lined up might be able to circumnavigate the school grounds twice. He went on about which students from which class had just gotten together, but that person from that class had just split up with that other person\u2026 there were all kinds of reasons for breaking up. They seemed to be dating just for fun.The biggest scandal had happened last year. Even Xie Yu, who didn\u2019t listen to gossip, knew about it.There had been a girl with good grades, the literature rep of her class. The sort of girl who gave speeches at the yearly parent assembly, and who looked well-behaved and demure. But she had gotten into a relationship with a transfer student who led a messy life.After a while, the transfer student had wanted to break up but the girl had staunchly refused.When they broke up, they made a big scene in the corridor. The transfer student said, pained, \u201cWe\u2019re not compatible. Forget it. When you have problems in school, I can only watch you get frustrated but I can\u2019t help you at all.\u201d\u201cIf I run into something I don\u2019t understand, I can ask the teacher\u2014\u201d\u201cNo, you don\u2019t get it. This isn\u2019t something that a teacher can solve. This is a communication gap between us that we can\u2019t bridge.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThis story was still making the rounds on Erzhong\u2019s school forum to this day. The thread was highlighted in red and pinned.Xie Yu solved the math problem, then cleared his notes app again. He thought, No rush. We can take our time.But he had no idea that He Zhao was also thinking, No, if there\u2019s too big a gap my little friend might become self-conscious.Xue Xisheng had picked a complicated solution, and his notes covered half the blackboard. He had also made a mistake: while solving for x, he had forgotten to consider the range of validity.Near the end of class, Old Wu briefly went over the solution to the problem.He Zhao was still on his phone game, and he glanced up at the blackboard while the game was loading. During class, he had finished all the missions currently available to him when he saw a team invitation from Shen Jie as he was about to go offline. Reflexively, he hit accept.Wu Zheng reminded the class rep to collect homework from the faculty office later on, then packed up his things and went to the class next door.Xie Yu had just put away his phone when he heard He Zhao curse.Xie Yu initially thought he had lost a round, but when he moved closer and glanced at He Zhao\u2019s screen, he noticed that one of the characters on the screen was female, wearing a skirt and with long hair.He Zhao had earbuds in and had probably turned on team voice chat. Xie Yu reached out and took one of the earbuds, putting it in his own ear, and heard a girl\u2019s soft voice. \u201cI don\u2019t really know how to play this game. Can you protect me later on?\u201dXie Yu wound his finger around the cord. He drawled, \u201cYou\u2019re living the good life, ge. Even helping girls.\u201dHe Zhao had his own difficulties.When Shen Jie had invited him to join the team just now, he had asked him to help a new player, saying this concerned his lifelong happiness but he had a stomachache and needed to go to the toilet.Before He Zhao could refuse, Shen jie had added the girl to the team and run off.\u201cNo,\u201d He Zhao immediately explained. Xie Yu\u2019s jealousy was obvious, and although He Zhao quite liked the look of his boyfriend being jealous, he still immediately turned off the mic and explained. \u201cI don\u2019t know her. This is a girl Shen Jie is teaching. I really don\u2019t know her.\u201dXie Yu said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t know her, then why did he ask you to help?\u201d\u201cHe went to the toilet and needed someone to hold the fort for a while.\u201dXie Yu continued, \u201cHe asked you of all people. You do this a lot, do you?\u201dHe Zhao was speechless.Xie Yu didn\u2019t keep picking at it, either.Seeing that He Zhao was trying so earnestly to explain himself, Xie Yu continued talking for a while but didn\u2019t ask He Zhao to leave the team. In fact, he started up his own copy of the game. \u201cAdd me, quick. Class is about to start.\u201dThe girl was still talking, but He Zhao heard none of it.His mind was full of, Damn, my boyfriend\u2019s usually so cold but when he throws a tantrum he\u2019s too damn cute.The girl\u2019s handle was a string of emojis. She was clearly interested in He Zhao, even though He Zhao hadn\u2019t said much.[Emoji]: \u201cGege, are you from Erzhong too?\u201d[Emoji]: \u201cDo you have a girlfriend?\u201dAfter hanging around Xie Yu for so long, He Zhao had learned some of his mannerisms, although he didn\u2019t use them as harshly as Xie Yu did. Xie Yu would have said, \u201cNone of your business,\u201d so He Zhao said, \u201cI have a boyfriend.\u201dA long time later, the round ended. He Zhao immediately exited the game, worried that Emoji would ask him to start another round.Xie Yu slumped on his side of the desk, looking at He Zhao. \u201cYou\u2019re not worried she\u2019ll tell Shen Jie?\u201dHe Zhao put away his earphones and looked at the timetable. There was one class period left. \u201cNo need for her to tell him. He already knows.\u201dThe classroom was very noisy.Liu Cunhao and Wan Da were making a ruckus. When they passed Xie Yu and He Zhao, Liu Cunhao collided with Xie Yu\u2019s desk. The table shook and the sound of it moving reached Xie Yu\u2019s ears.Xie Yu blinked. \u201cHe knows?\u201d\u201cHe found out on the class trip.\u201d He Zhao flipped through his text messages. \u201cI\u2019m looking for it and you can see it for yourself.\u201dXie Yu took the phone and glanced at it. He saw Shen Jie\u2019s anxious questions and He Zhao\u2019s reply.He Zhao\u2019s reply was very confident, and even had a hint of pride.Xie Yu, my boyfriend.Xie Yu had never imagined He Zhao would be so forthright.It wasn\u2019t convenient for them to spread the news of their relationship like other people who might easily say, \u2018I have a partner.\u2019 Unlike other young couples, they couldn\u2019t hold hands openly around the school as long as they avoided the teachers.Xie Yu considered it for a while. In He Zhao\u2019s shoes, he might have done the same.Shen Jie returned from the toilet. On the way back he slipped into Class 3 through the back door, patted He Zhao\u2019s shoulder and said, \u201cHow did it go? Are you done helping her?\u201d\u201cHelp her, my ass.\u201d He Zhao kicked him. \u201cI have a boyfriend and you pushed me into a fire pit.\u201dShen Jie dodged and said, \u201cYeah, I asked because I know you have a boyfriend\u2026 if it were someone else I might not have trusted them.\u201dHe Zhao tossed a bottle of mineral water at him.\u201cOkay, okay, I won\u2019t ask you next time.\u201dShen Jie picked up the water bottle and put it back on the desk. \u201cI\u2019ll ask Old Xie. I trust him, too.\u201dHe Zhao said, \u201c\u2026I think you\u2019re tired of living.\u201dOver the last few days, Shen Jie must have properly processed the news of their relationship, because he didn\u2019t react oddly at all when he looked at them both.He was quite calm.\u201cWhat would you ask me for?\u201d Xie Yu said. \u201cSo you can experience solo play while on a team?\u201dShen Jie: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d He had nearly forgotten Xie Yu was a lone wolf sort of player.They chatted for a while longer, then the class bell rang and Shen Jie went back to Class 8.Before Shen Jie left, he paused after noticing the red bands on both their wrists. He did a double-take, then said out of nowhere, \u201cIt\u2019s good. It\u2019s nothing, and I wasn\u2019t surprised at all.\u201dGoing by his Zhao-ge\u2019s EQ, he was doomed to be forever alone, so the fact that he had found a boyfriend was already a miracle.He Zhao smiled and said, \u201cGet lost, now.\u201dThe last class period passed. The people participating in the arts festival stayed for another half an hour to practice.The classroom was almost empty and only the students on duty remained behind.Xu Jing played their selected song on the classroom computer. In the middle of the song was a section where the performers had to pair up. They split up, two to a group. The dance moves were rather intimate, and one of the pair had to hold the other\u2019s waist.Xu Jing and Xu Qingqing demonstrated.He Zhao stood behind Xie Yu, his hands on Xie Yu\u2019s waist pulling him closer. He didn\u2019t want to let go. \u201cAre you coming to evening self-study later?\u201dXie Yu, still thinking of what He Zhao had done, asked reflexively, \u201cYou\u2019re not coming?\u201d\u201cNot coming to class,\u201d He Zhao said. \u201cI want to be in the dorms coming on something else instead.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dXie Yu had noticed that that He Zhao\u2019s mind was getting dirtier and dirtier lately.Luo Wenqiang was tall, and his waist being held by an equally tall boy created a very strange image. Xu Jing considered going up to help guide them, but nearly burst out laughing.Luo Wenqiang sighed stiffly. \u201cJing-jing, you didn\u2019t say there was a section like this.\u201dXu Jing replied, \u201cJust relax. Look at Zhao-ge and Yu-ge, and how natural they are\u2026\u201dWan Da waved a hand dismissively. He had already noticed. \u201cThey\u2019re different.\u201dAfter rehearsal, they made a chat group. They titled it Coolest Guy Group in the Universe, and sent some instructional videos as well as notifications for their next rehearsal time.Discussion in the chat group was lively all through evening self-study. Their phones kept vibrating with notifications, like they were performers preparing for a debut.All of them wanted to look impressive on stage and instantly become famous..[Luo Wenqiang]: Last year, someone from the class next door played guitar and many girls wanted to be friends with him afterwards.[Luo Wenqiang]: I don\u2019t need that many. Just one is fine.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dXie Yu showered, then walked out drying his hair. His notifications had hit 99+. He swiped on his screen with a still-damp finger, dismissing them, then noticed a familiar green apple notification at the bottom of the drag down list.Question King Tournament.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

We have returned!Xie Yu froze.Returned? Hadn\u2019t the app gone offline?Xie Yu had forgotten to delete the app and had left it in a corner of his screen, never imagining that it would one day come back online. He stared at the notification, then remembered the idiotic thing he had done over summer\u2014fight over first place, day and night, with a crazy person.Xie Yu hesitated, then opened the app.Currently updating. Please do not close the app~The developers had probably found a new sponsor. They had even updated their question bank and added new problem sets from the premier high schools. Even some of Erzhong\u2019s questions appeared.Xie Yu glanced through them and found that the question-answering format had changed slightly. Users were now categorized into bronze, silver and gold, and a successfully answered question might drop bonus rewards, such as hidden questions not shown to the public.These minute changes gamified the app, and those not in the know might have mistaken it for a real online game.The Question King user chat was still the same, and the same active users from before all sent firework emojis to celebrate.[Ilovestudying]: I knew it! The love for studying will never die out![ForABetterTomorrow]: Without Question King I had to do practice papers on my own.

Let\u2019s PK.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cBoss Xie.\u201d Before Xie Yu could look more closely, Zhou Dalei called him. \u201cI was updating my games and I saw that app from summer vacation. Damn, it\u2019s back?\u201dDalei\u2019s phone apps consisted almost completely of games. He ran an update every day. Probably because there were too many of them and he didn\u2019t keep track, Question King was still there, too. He had been shocked to receive the update notification.Xie Yu said vaguely, \u201cAh.\u201dZhou Dalei was wearing slippers and sitting on a plastic chair by the barbecue stall. The barbecue rack was behind him, thick smoke and the smell of cooking meat carried on the wind. He took a cigarette from his pocket, put it in his mouth, and lit it. \u201cI got into the lobby. Now even zero-pointers can get in.\u201dXie Yu said, \u201cHuh.\u201dZhou Dalei continued, \u201cThere are levels, too\u2026 You know, right? Bronze and whatever.\u201dXie Yu had only briefly glanced at it and could faintly recall that his user level was King-something. He asked, \u201cWhat level are you?\u201dZhou Dalei said, \u201cMe? Stubborn Scrap Metal.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAwesome, right? I\u2019ve played games for so long and I only know about bronze and such. I never imagined there would be scrap metal, too. I learned something today.\u201dXie Yu laughed, then asked, \u201cYou\u2019re at the stall?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d His mother was bent over, dragging a box of ingredients. Zhou Dalei was in the way, so she stood up and kicked him nearly off the chair.Lately, the weather had been steadily getting cooler. Zhou Dalei\u2019s mother expended a lot of energy preparing food, and when she got busy she also got angry more easily. She usually thought the world of her son, but now she was irritated by him. \u201cScram.\u201dZhou Dalei was helpless against his mother\u2019s seasonal moods. He got up and started walking to the side. His mother wiped off her hands and asked, \u201cWho are you talking to? Xiao-yu?\u201d\u201cLet me talk to him.\u201d Before Dalei could answer, his mother snatched the phone. \u201cOff with you.\u201dZhou Dalei\u2019s mom talked to Xie Yu very nicely, to the point Zhou Dalei felt that Boss Xie was more like his mother\u2019s real son.When He Zhao pushed open the door, Xie Yu was sitting on the bed, eyes lowered, on the phone.Xie Yu had just showered and was wearing a sweater. Although it was a cool color, the material looked soft and made him look soft, too. Even his voice was quiet. \u201cMm, got it.\u201dDalei\u2019s mom had a loud voice, which carried even when she was chatting cordially with someone. \u201cLast time you came back, I and Lei-zi\u2019s dad both weren\u2019t home and didn\u2019t get to see you. When are you off school again? Come and stay for a few days\u2026\u201dXie Yu was still wearing his school pants, loose-fitting with a gray stripe on one side. He had folded up the cuffs, revealing his ankles.Hearing movement at the door, he glanced up, then mouthed to He Zhao: Close the door.Lei\u2019s mom was currently talking about a mahjong competition that had recently started up in their neighborhood.Xie Yu wasn\u2019t a very popular figure on Black Water Street, but Aunt Mei and the others were still very happy to take him along so that other people would suffer. When they played cards with new friends and lost badly, they asked Xie Yu over to play a couple rounds for them and recoup their losses.He Zhao closed the door, then squeezed into the bed with Xie Yu and waited for his call to end.While listening to the call, He Zhao suddenly leaned over and kissed Xie Yu\u2019s face.Xie Yu said, \u201c\u2026What are you doing?\u201dLei\u2019s mom was still talking, and hearing Xie Yu say this, she paused too. \u201cWhat?\u201dHe Zhao was done teasing and smiled as he backed off to the right. He leaned against Xie Yu\u2019s headboard and didn\u2019t keep bothering him.Next to He Zhao was the study desk. While Xie Yu was on the phone, He Zhao looked around and caught sight of a Rubik\u2019s cube on the desk, along with several books. One of them was called Improve Your Temper And Face Life Calmly.He Zhao flipped it open. On the inside was written, Boss Xie, happy birthday.\u201cThis was a birthday present?\u201d After Xie Yu hung up, He Zhao held up the book and asked, \u201cWho gave you this? They\u2019re creative.\u201dXie Yu glanced at it. \u201cThe guy from the station.\u201dZhou Dalei had gift-wrapped the book and tied it up with a bright red ribbon in a butterfly knot.Remembering this, Xie Yu laughed again and added, \u201cI nearly broke his legs.\u201dHe Zhao thought, Broke his legs?Xie Yu had kept the book till now.His little friend seemed hard-hearted, but he really wasn\u2019t.Xie Yu\u2019s smile faded and he tossed his phone aside.Lei\u2019s mom had said a lot of things just now. Zhou Dalei had tried to snatch the phone back to no avail. Now that the noise on the other side of the phone had stopped, Xie Yu realized he actually felt disappointed.It was the same sort of disappointment Xie Yu had felt the first few days after he and his mother had moved away from Black Water Street. When he woke up in the morning, he habitually started off to Wang-ma\u2019s to eat breakfast, then realized he could no longer hear street hawkers yelling.The more Xie Yu thought about it, the more frustrated he felt.Ordinarily, he would just curse out loud and be done with it, but now He Zhao was sitting next to him.The idiot was currently reading that Face Life Calmly book, and was even reading interesting passages aloud for him. \u201cMy little friend, you didn\u2019t read this at all, did you? It\u2019s actually quite useful\u2026 Learn from it, and don\u2019t keep being violent to my\u2026 no, don\u2019t keep being violent to me.\u201dHe Zhao had swallowed the words, \u2018my family.\u2019Xie Yu called him, \u201cZhao-ge.\u201dHe Zhao stopped mid-speech.Xie Yu wasn\u2019t sure how to explain, either. It seemed too melodramatic to say out loud. Besides, he wasn\u2019t the complaining sort. The moment the name left his mouth, he regretted it.So they looked at each other for a while, then Xie Yu said, \u201cNothing. Just wanted to call you.\u201dXie Yu never called him \u2018ge\u2019 for no reason. The first time he had done it was at Liu Cunhao\u2019s birthday event, and he had followed it up with, \u2018You provoked me first.\u2019He Zhao replied, \u201cNothing? As if.\u201dIt was all pointless, anyway.Xie Yu was reminiscing about days he couldn\u2019t go back to. He thought about those noisy, vulgar sounds that could have come from a marketplace.Xie Yu had let one of his feet fall off the bed while he was talking. His feet were bare and touched the floor.It was cool to the touch.\u201cThen think about something else.\u201d He Zhao smiled. \u201cFor example, where I stand, in your present and in your future.\u201dHe Zhao said all of this very seriously, the dismissive tone he usually carried now absent. Xie Yu\u2019s silhouette was reflected in his eyes.He was so serious about it that Xie Yu leaned in without realizing.As if possessed, he leaned forward to kiss He Zhao. In that moment, he thought, why be dramatic? Just do it.Their lips touched, and his mind went blank.He Zhao, worried that he would hurt Xie Yu again, tried to hold himself back at first, until Xie Yu curled his tongue and touched He Zhao\u2019s.Just the one touch didn\u2019t count.Xie Yu\u2019s hands had undone He Zhao\u2019s trouser fastening. The school pants were designed loosely, and he reached in after he undid them.Xie Yu\u2019s hand was cool to the touch, his fingers lightly curved. When he first touched it, he felt burned by its warmth. He paused, scared to move.He Zhao cursed out loud, his hands wandering downward, too. \u201cAre you trying to kill me?\u201dIt was nearly lights-out and the signal sounded outside the dormitory.By the time they both found release, the dorm building was pitch-black. They only heard each other\u2019s breathing, hurried and intertwined.Xie Yu felt around at the head of his bed for a pack of tissues.He Zhao took it and was going to help Xie Yu clean up, but before he could touch him Xie Yu nearly kicked him out of bed. \u201c\u2026Don\u2019t touch me.\u201dHe Zhao steadied himself, then asked, \u201cAre we going to sleep together?\u201dXie Yu asked, \u201cCan you fall asleep with a stick like that in your pants?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThinking about it, he had a point.The bed was small. Squeezed together, they were skin to skin.Xie Yu sat up and reached out to turn on the electric light at the head of his bed.In the dim light, He Zhao noticed that his little friend\u2019s sweater had ridden up on his stomach, revealing most of his waist. Then he looked lower and saw the loose school pants he had undone just now.He kept looking, then bent down and touch Xie Yu\u2019s lips again. \u201cI\u2019ll go back to my room then.\u201dXie Yu said, \u201cGet lost.\u201dHe was the sort of bedmate who, after doing up his pants, would pretend they were strangers.He Zhao smiled and let go of him.Even though He Zhao had left, the smell didn\u2019t fade for a long time.The desk light was still lit. Xie Yu noticed that his phone, which he had tossed onto the bed, was also lit up.The notifications piled up.Thinking He Zhao had sent him something again, Xie Yu caught hold of his phone and unlocked it, only to see more than ten notifications from an app.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dDear esteemed user, how do you do? We are the organizers of the Question King Tournament.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 94": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fake SlackersChapter 071 - Whoever doesn't show up is a dog.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayFake SlackersTranslator: JuryEditor: NomNomFirst Published on Chaleuria\u2014071 \u2013 Whoever doesn\u2019t show up is a dog.Xie Yu\u2019s hand was still sticky. He read one notification, then put his phone aside to clean his hand with another two tissues.The hem of the sweater he had just put on after showering was stained with something. It looked suggestive, and the smell mixed with the scent of detergent.As Xie Yu cleaned his hands, he thought again of how He Zhao had been unable to control himself. When He Zhao had climaxed at the end, he had bitten down on Xie Yu\u2019s shoulder, teeth sinking bluntly into flesh.Xie Yu\u2019s hand jerked.Given how awful this app was, the notifications were probably official announcements such as, To celebrate the return of the Question King app, we\u2019re releasing thirty limited-edition problem sets,\u2019 or \u2018Prizes for completing questions! Let us soar above the sea of knowledge.Xie Yu carefully finished cleaning up, then picked up his phone again. A private message titled \u2018Question King Offline Meetup\u2019 caught his eye.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dA reward for loyal players! On the long road of studying, do you feel alone? Do you feel lost? Have you searched high and low for companions who will study and grow with you?We have decided to organize an offline meetup! To reward our loyal players, anyone who registered as part of the Question King family during this past summer vacation can join this gathering. Let us share our studying experiences face to face and meet even more like-minded friends who share this heartfelt love of studying.Xie Yu calmly opened the next unread private message.It was an invitation specifying the time and location of the meetup, along with the agenda.10 a.m. that Saturday at Century City.The agenda was packed. There were group homework sessions, peer tutoring sessions, sessions to share favorite mock papers or study materials, and other similarly strange programming. There was even an event where they would watch The Birth of Einstein in a mini-theater.At the end of the invitation was neatly written, We hope to see you there.Go, my ass.Xie Yu glanced at the next few lines and didn\u2019t have the patience to keep reading.The remainder of the notification was probably details for the in-person meeting. Instinct told him that the whole group of madmen in the forums would all be there.As he expected, the Question King chat was very lively.When considering meeting online friends in person, normal people probably thought about what to wear and how to present themselves in order to give their online friends a good first impression.But this lot was different.[ServeTheHomeland]: Has everyone decided which mock paper to bring to the meeting?[ForABetterTomorrow]: Of course. It has to be the Five Years of Mock Papers and Three Years of College Exams.\u00b9 This set has extraordinary power. Once you open it, you won\u2019t be able to stop your hands from doing all the questions at a mad pace.[StudystudystudythatsallIdo]: Then I\u2019ll bring 38 Heavenly Sets and we can exchange.[EnglishClassRep]: Me? I like Guide to College Exam English. It covers all the content points and is a very different study experience. With the guidance of this famous teacher, we break through all our misunderstandings.\u2026\u2026Xie Yu sat on the side of his bed and took off his sweater. He was going to take another shower.Beneath the weak lighting in the private bathroom, he let the water flow over his shoulders. There was a very faint pain and only now did Xie Yu realize that that idiot had really broken skin.Then He Zhao\u2019s words about the future echoed in his ears again.A future with you.Xie Yu shut his eyes and sighed.Perhaps because the shower he had taken had been cold, he now felt much more awake. Now that he was no longer sleepy, he thought about going into Question King and doing some practice questions.After refreshing the app, he saw that the question archive contained a set of \u2018Real Questions from Top Instructors.\u2019 The app\u2019s developers had likely invited top instructors to write questions and come up with these unique problem sets.In the time it had taken Xie Yu to shower, the Question King chat had started in on a different subject.[Ilovestudying]: Is the rivalry between God X and Shameless still ongoing?[FightingUpstream]: Yes, and the devs haven\u2019t announced who the real Question King is yet.[StudystudystudythatsallIdo]: Didn\u2019t you see the announcement? The devs sent them both PMs and said they\u2019d follow up.At this, Xie Yu\u2019s hand stilled on his mock paper.In the pile of private messages he had given up reading, there had indeed been a notification from Question King. Xie Yu scrolled down and saw a notification titled \u2018Summer Tournament.\u2019Dear esteemed jsdhwdmax, in the Summer Tournament, you scored equal points to User \u2018Question King.\u2019 Since the tournament season has ended, we hope that you can settle this with \u2018Question King\u2019 privately.Xie Yu read it twice to be sure he hadn\u2019t read wrongly.Settle this privately.In his friends list, \u2018Question King\u2019s profile picture and username were both grayed out, and his status was offline.Xie Yu thought that would be the end of it. Maybe the madman had deleted the game. But the next day, when he was awoken by the broadcast and went online, he found a message from Question King.It had been sent after 11pm last night and the first line consisted of only two words:[Question King]: Forget it.Mad Dog was still delivering his rah-rah announcement over the intercom. There were no upcoming tests but that didn\u2019t stop him from anticipating the end-of-term tests. \u201cDon\u2019t think you still have time! If you keep saying, \u2018Tomorrow,\u2019 the endless tomorrows will bury you. Friends, today! Today! Take action today!\u201dXie Yu hoisted himself on one arm into a sitting position. He and Shameless had had the same thought.There was nothing to settle. Nothing to fight about.Then Xie Yu kept reading. There were two more lines[Question King]: Admit defeat.[Question King]: I\u2019ll let you off.The message was only three lines long but it dripped with arrogance.Xie Yu was so mad he started laughing. He was already in a bad mood from having to get up early, and he had been sleeping well before that. He was ready to fight anyone who approached him now and was primed to explode at anything.When Zhou Dalei came looking for him in the morning, if Xie Yu hadn\u2019t gotten up, he didn\u2019t even dare enter the house. He shouted for Xie Yu from outside, and turned and ran when he was done.So all the Question King users currently online now saw something unprecedented. The stoic and silent God X had typed something into the chat.[Jsdhwdmax] to Question King: Idiot.[Jsdhwdmax] to Question King: Saturday, Century City. Whoever doesn\u2019t show up is a dog.Xie Yu was annoyedly tapping out the last punctuation mark when He Zhao knocked on the door.The distressed cries were still sounding outside the door.Mad Dog\u2019s rah-rah speech had gone longer than five minutes. Now he had started talking about his own youth and jumped from topic to topic. \u201cWhen I was in high school, I got up at 5 a.m. to memorize vocabulary. No matter how cold it was, my bed couldn\u2019t keep me\u2026\u201dThe occupants of the dorm room diagonally down from him were already yelling and pounding the wall. \u201cStop! Just let the endless tomorrows bury me already.\u201dAnd the soul-deep cries of other students: \u201cWhy was I so adamant about living at school?\u201dXie Yu wore a thunderous expression when he pushed open the door.He Zhao leaned against his doorframe, not surprised at all. He very naturally raised a hand to smooth Xie Yu\u2019s ruffled feathers. \u201cMy little friend is always so annoyed when he gets up in the morning.\u201dXie Yu said, \u201cI met an idiot and I want to punch him.\u201dHe Zhao didn\u2019t understand. \u201cWhat idiot?\u201d\u201cNothing, someone online.\u201d Xie Yu turned around, about to go back and wash up, before saying, \u201cCome in and close the door.\u201dXie Yu did not like chatting online.He Zhao had seen his QQ account. It resembled a side account. Wan Da had tried to add him several times but never succeeded. Eventually he had plucked up the courage to ask Xie Yu directly, only to find out that Xie Yu didn\u2019t even look at his friend requests.Wan Da had nearly broken down down. \u201cYu-ge, I sent you eight friend requests! You didn\u2019t see a single one of them?\u201dXie Yu said, \u201cI really didn\u2019t pay attention.\u201dHe had more friends on Weixin.Considering all this, He Zhao concluded that his boyfriend had likely encountered some exciting news or commentary that morning. \u201cThere are all sorts of people online. Some are going to be idiots.\u201dXie Yu washed his face and hung up his towel again.He Zhao lay down on Xie Yu\u2019s bed out of habit, watching him look through his closet for clothes.Xie Yu hadn\u2019t washed his school pants from yesterday, and the other pair was not yet dry. After looking for a while, Xie Yu had to wear his casual clothes. Then he picked up a sweater.By the time Xie Yu was done changing, He Zhao concluded that he was bad at minding his own business.Why the hell had he gone looking for Xie Yu for so early in the morning?Damn it.Xie Yu put on long pants. His casual pants were not as baggy and shapeless as the school pants, and they outlined his straight and slim legs. His zipper was still down and he rested a finger on the zip, letting the pants hang at his waist.Xie Yu pulled the zip up little by little and asked, \u201cAre you still sleeping?\u201d\u201cI was going to,\u201d He Zhao said, \u201c\u2026but not any more.\u201dHe Zhao and Xie Yu went to the cafeteria for breakfast. When they walked upstairs to class, Luo Wenqiang was cleaning the classroom.Xie Yu went to the back door, then stopped. \u201cWhat\u2019s gotten into him?\u201dLuo Wenqiang held a washcloth in his hand, swinging his hips as he cleaned the windowsill. As the dance moves from yesterday surfaced in his mind, he hummed along, \u201cLa la, la la la, la\u2026\u201dHe Zhao: \u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cOh, hello.\u201d Luo Wenqiang saw them and stopped shaking his butt. \u201cMorning.\u201dPeople came and went through the corridor.Xie Yu had the sudden impulse to sever all ties with his classmate Luo Wenqiang.But He Zhao adjusted quickly. He smiled and said, \u201cGym rep, good moves. Elegant posture. If I was a girl, I\u2019d be enraptured\u2026\u201dXie Yu said, \u201cQuit acting. Let it go.\u201dThe first class of the day was English.Xie Yu finished his writing-from-memory assignment, then lay down on his desk to sleep. But he couldn\u2019t fall asleep, so he fished his phone out from under his desk.Now that he was awake, he thought that what he had said to Question King in a fit of anger had been a bit much.There was no reason to be mad. \u2018Question King\u2019 was probably a die-hard diligent student whose glasses were thicker than a beer bottle. Were they really going to do mock papers face to face when they met?Xie Yu opened the app and found that the forum had exploded. Even now, it was still going.[StudystudystudythatsallIdo]: Damn, they\u2019re going to go face to face?![TopTenInClass]: God X is fantastic![TsinghuaPekingUIsNotADream]: So strong![985211]: God X, remember what you said! Fight to the death! Whoever doesn\u2019t show up is a dog!Xie Yu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Fuck.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 95": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fake SlackersChapter 072 - I'll give you a three-question head start.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayFake SlackersTranslator: JuryEditor: NomNomFirst Published on Chaleuria\u2014072 \u2013 I\u2019ll give you a three-question head start.God X sending a challenge in the public chat was really shocking and sent the chat into a frenzy. The future pillars of society, who held the hopes of their country, were all secretly sending messages while in class.After a period of chaos, the chat finally calmed down.[ConqueringPekingU]: Alright, I can\u2019t any more. Class is starting and I have to listen. Nothing must keep me from paying attention in class.[985211]: I\u2019m holding my phone right now. Every word I type makes me feel ashamed to face my school and my teachers. I\u2019ve betrayed all their hopes for me. Goodbye. Chat after school.[Ilovestudying]: This English class\u2026 this is the first time I\u2019m looking at my phone in class since elementary school. I really feel guilty.Right now, Xie Yu felt that he had dug a pit for himself while he wasn\u2019t quite awake, and now he had fallen into it and had to stay there.The English teacher led the class in reading the new vocabulary words aloud. Then she asked them to pair up and read them again to familiarize themselves with the words, and turned to write the topic on the board.While the classroom was filled with the sound of people reading out loud, Xie Yu turned off his phone and threw it back into his desk with a thud.It was a muted sound and wasn\u2019t very noticeable.He Zhao was at an important point in his game. Hearing the thud, he assumed the noise was keeping Xie Yu from sleeping, so he subconsciously reached out to cover Xie Yu\u2019s ears.He kept fighting monsters one-handed, using one hand in place of two. He asked, \u201cToo loud?\u201dXie Yu was slumped on his desk. He Zhao\u2019s palm lay next to his ear, He Zhao\u2019s fingers gently threading through his hair. His voice was slightly muffled and sounded far away.Xie Yu was about to say, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not sleeping,\u201d but before the words left his mouth, they somehow turned into an, \u2018Mm,\u2019 of assent.The skill board was split into two, and even though He Zhao had quick fingers he couldn\u2019t play properly with only one hand.After the class had finished reading vocabulary, the classroom quieted down. He Zhao had forgotten where his hand was and Xie Yu forgot to remind him about it, too.He Zhao often did tiny, unnoticeable things like that.Like sunlight streaming in through the window, he quietly smoothed down all Xie Yu\u2019s feelings of frustration.The English teacher finished writing down the topic, then summarized every paragraph. She split the board into several sections, put down the chalk, dusted off her hands, and said, \u201cAre you finished reading? Now I\u2019ll call someone up\u2026\u201dShe glanced around the room and her gaze fell on the last row of seats.She was speechless.\u201cYou all are very touchy-feely, aren\u2019t you. Your love for your classmates can move the heavens and earth.\u201d After this bout of sarcasm, she tapped the table with the blackboard eraser, then called Xie Yu and He Zhao by name. \u201cThe two of you, get up. Stand up, stand properly. Read the chapter vocabulary words out loud. No one is to help them.\u201dXie Yu slowly stood up, opened his book, and said, \u201cI can\u2019t read them.\u201dFollowing the pronunciation guide, he deliberately read them wrong. It sounded terrible.\u201cAll right, you can\u2019t. What were you doing while I was going over them? Now you say you can\u2019t?\u201d She then looked over at Xie Yu\u2019s deskmate, who was flipping through his book. \u201cHe Zhao, you read it.\u201dHe Zhao asked, \u201cTeach, which page?\u201dThe English teacher: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dShe didn\u2019t keep putting them on the spot. If she pursued the matter every time, she would probably faint every class period from sheer anger. She made them remain standing, then called Xu Qingqing to read it before letting them sit.Xu Qingqing held up her book and read aloud according to the pronunciation guide, every word perfect. Clearly, she had prepared at home beforehand.He Zhao, standing up, was in just the right position to see Luo Wenqiang secretly eating biscuits in the row in front.\u201cOld Xie.\u201d He Zhao elbowed Xie Yu. \u201cLook.\u201d\u201cLook at what?\u201dXie Yu was a little tired of standing. He stuck his hands in his pockets, glanced over, and saw Luo Wenqiang with his hand held carefully in a lotus position. He pulled out a piece, then waited for the English teacher\u2019s attention to shift before swiftly stuffing it into his mouth.Xie Yu watched for a while. \u201cHe didn\u2019t eat breakfast?\u201dHe Zhao said, \u201cHe said this morning he ate six whole meat buns\u2026 but maybe he\u2019s hungry again?\u201dXu Qingqing finished reading. As He Zhao sat down, he also picked up the pen cap on his desk and threw it at Luo Wenqiang.Luo Wenqiang had not swallowed the piece of cookie in his mouth and nearly choked. He looked back to see who had thrown it.He Zhao smiled as he leaned back in his seat, whispering, \u201cShare?\u201dSo Luo Wenqiang\u2019s biscuit tin was passed down from the first row.When it passed by Wan Da, he took two pieces. By the time it got to them, there would probably only be crumbs left. Wan Da wasn\u2019t really hungry; he just had itchy fingers and also wanted the fun of secretly eating in class.The box of milk peanut cookies was carefully smuggled across the classroom.When the box was about to reach them, Liu Cunhao caught sight of it, waved to Wan Da, and waved. \u201cWhat is that? I want some too.\u201dThe English teacher was still analyzing the sentence on the blackboard while the box continued circulating through the classroom.After the box was passed back across the classroom and finally reached them, it was already empty.Xie Yu took the box. \u201cAnimals, the lot of you.\u201dHe Zhao looked, too. \u201cDamn, not a single one left?\u201dLuo Wenqiang, having watched his cookies leave him one by one, couldn\u2019t pay attention to class any more. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dFuck, those cookies.\u201cWhere shall we rehearse today?\u201d After class let out, the Coolest Guy Group in the Universe gathered around the last row of seats.\u201cGym class later? Let\u2019s just practice in the quad.\u201d\u201cNo, we can\u2019t reveal our skills so soon.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dXie Yu didn\u2019t pay close attention to the discussion.He sat to the side, and when he got bored he tapped on the Apple of Knowledge icon again. After logging in, he found two messages on his home screen.[Question King] to [jsdhwdmax]: Sure.[Question King] to [jsdhwdmax]: Whoever doesn\u2019t come is a dog.Xie Yu now understood how Zhou Dalei had picked a fight with someone over a violet weapon.Dignity.The Coolest Guy Group in the Universe had planned to practice in the quad, but when they arrived, there were too many people there. Of course, this was because there were two very famous personages in their midst.Just by standing there, Xie Yu and He Zhao were already subjected to the treatment of performers making their debut appearance.After starting the music, they couldn\u2019t bear the stares and stealth photography from all the onlookers and decided to go back to their classroom to practice.Before they started practicing again, Xu Jing asked, \u201cIs everyone free on the weekend?\u201dLiu Cunhao said, \u201cYup, yup.\u201dLuo Wenqiang said, \u201cI can be.\u201dXie Yu said, \u201cNo,\u201d then heard He Zhao also say, \u201cI have something going on, really sorry.\u201dNearly half the group couldn\u2019t make it, so they had to drop the idea of weekend practice.Xu Jing turned around to adjust the sound settings, and Xie Yu whispered, \u201cYou\u2019re going home over the weekend?\u201dHe Zhao had not gone home since the start of the school term. It was about time he made a trip back.\u201cNothing important.\u201d He Zhao sat on his desk, looking unworried. \u201cCall me ge and I won\u2019t go.\u201dOf course, Xie Yu didn\u2019t.The week passed in the blink of an eye.Homework accumulated, Old Tang lectured, and the weekend arrived.\u201cStudents, when you leave for the weekend, stay safe.\u201d The classroom had mostly emptied and only the unlucky students on classroom cleaning duty were still there. Old Tang was still improvising his speech. \u201cFinish your homework on time. When studying, reviewing old material will give you new insight\u2026\u201dXie Yu packed up his things and leaned against the rear doorframe, waiting for one of the students on duty.He Zhao was still cleaning the blackboard. He could reach the top of the board if he stretched his hand up.Xie Yu, watching him, was mesmerized.Xie Yu had logged into Question King several times over the last few days, discussing with Shameless how they would compete on Saturday. Although they had agreed to meet face to face and have it out, there needed to be rules to this confrontation.After discussing it, the only viable option was doing a mock paper and grading it on the spot.Shameless had no objection. Any mock paper, any subject.Then he added, I\u2019ll give you a three-question headstart.He was really asking for a beating. In Xie Yu\u2019s entire life, the only other person he had ever heard such provocative words from was the idiot currently cleaning the blackboard.On some level, his boyfriend actually had a few things in common with that good student whose glasses were probably thicker than the base of a beer bottle.[Ilovestudying]: Is everyone on their way? Is God X on his way?[StudystudystudythatsallIdo]: On the way. I and my 38 Ultimate Strategies are on the way to Century City.[TopTenInClass]: On the bus. I stayed up all last night and wrote a 5000-word study reflection essay discussing my study strategies. Hopefully you\u2019ll find it helpful.[FightingUpstream]: I\u2019m on my way too. Very excited! I want to do some questions on the bus! And I can\u2019t wait for God X and Shameless\u2019s showdown!\u2026\u2026Early the next morning, the Question King chat was refreshing madly with messages from this lot.Xie Yu was still looking through the suggested route on his phone maps app.Century City was very popular and people would often hold events such as class gatherings there.It had all sorts of facilities and amenities, the most famous of which was a private hall with AV equipment. This was probably the first time the AV equipment would be used to screen The Birth of Einstein.Xie Yu didn\u2019t want to bother changing buses, so he took a direct bus.He had brought a mask with him when he left, to cover his face. He sat in the rearmost seat and glanced down at a private message Question King had sent him.[Question King]: I\u2019ll get to the point, my friend. You can still back out now.[Question King]: Even if I give you a three-question head start, you won\u2019t win.[jsdhwdmax]: Heh.After another half hour, Question King sent another message.[Question King]: I\u2019m here. Century City entrance.Xie Yu was sleepy, and typed with his eyes half closed. He thought, What\u2019s the point of telling me you\u2019re there? Who the hell knows who you are in this crowd. So he asked, What are you wearing? Any identifiers?[Question King]: Forget what I\u2019m wearing. I\u2019m the most good-looking one.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

At the very top of a tall building, a logo of two spread golden wings shone in the sunlight.The bus turned onto the street.The downtown district was crowded and pedestrians filled the streets. The bus slowed to a crawl. After several minutes had passed, the traffic lights had changed twice but the pair of golden wings was still on the other end of the street.Xie Yu glanced at the message again and laughed out loud.Shameless was not just shameless. He had a face. A very big face. He had a face so thick even bullets couldn\u2019t pierce it.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d The gaps between cars were very narrow. Xie Yu shifted uncomfortably in his seat, his foot catching on a protrusion on the seat in front, and cursed out loud. \u201cIdiot.\u201dThe bus moved too slowly.Cars honked outside the window, making a lot of noise.Xie Yu lifted a hand, finger catching on the side of his mask. He pulled his mask down some and took a breath.After another several minutes, the bus finally started moving again at its original pace. The golden wings drew closer and closer, and an announcement rang through the bus. \u201cNext stop, final destination, Century City. All passengers, please exit through the rear doors.\u201dThere were still about a dozen people on the bus.Several of them had already stood up and started walking towards the rear door when they heard the announcement. The bus had not stopped, but they held onto the railings and waited by the door.Xie Yu didn\u2019t move, but he put up the hood of his jacket. The jacket was black, loose-fitting, and the loose hood covered most of his forehead.Together with the mask, nearly his whole face was hidden.Xie Yu tapped out a message to Question King: Nearly there.Shameless finally described in detail what to look for.Xie Yu elected to ignore the decorative descriptions. Nonsense like, Although the sweater is a standard one, on me, it\u2019s not standard at all. An extraordinary aura\u2026Xie Yu had the sudden impulse to walk across the street and get on the bus going in the opposite direction.He endured it for a while, but ultimately caved.He looked down and typed out a sentence.[jsdhwdmax]: ****** [Sensitive phrases have been automatically censored.][Question King]: ?[Question King]: You were swearing at me?\u2026\u2026If Xie Yu carried on this conversation, it wouldn\u2019t stop at just cursing.Century City was very big. It was a shopping mall and amusement park in one, and there was even a small theme park at the city center. A carousel turned slowly.Several little girls sat on the carousel, their parents squatting to one side taking pictures.Xie Yu passed through the theme park, asking Question King generally where he was while he walked further in.The idiot had said he was at the entrance, but Xie Yu discovered after he got off the bus that Century City had four entrances. Which one??Xie Yu had covered up well.He wore both a hood and a mask, so his face was not visible, but he was tall and he carried himself well, so by covering up like this he drew even more attention.[Question King]: Entrance 3. What are you wearing?[jsdhwdmax]: Mask, hood. Black.[Question King]: All right. Hurry up.[jsdhwdmax]: Are you holding an exam paper?[Question King]: Yes. Best of the College Exams. Pick whichever you want to do.Entrance 3 was on the other side of the open-air play area.Xie Yu pulled out a folded mock paper. As discussed beforehand with Shameless, they both brought a mock exam with them. They would exchange papers and complete them within half an hour.Mock paper in hand, Xie Yu subconsciously looked through the crowd for an idiot wearing a sweater \u2018extraordinarily well,\u2019 and who was holding a copy of Best of the College Exams.There were many people at the entrance coming and going, but not many of them were standing still.Xie Yu glanced around a few times. After eliminating the ones standing around the door, his gaze swept over the elderly janitor bending over and cleaning the floor before landing on the railing on the opposite side.Someone was sitting arrogantly on the railing, which was no wider than a palm.He wore a thick sweater, both legs swinging in the air, a booklet in hand. Red cover, bright gold words: Best of the College Exams.From Xie Yu\u2019s perspective, he could only see the person\u2019s back.He seemed quite tall.Xie Yu looked again. He seemed very damn familiar.His bearing, his body shape\u2026 were all very like a certain person.Xie Yu thought again. It was impossible. His boyfriend\u2014last name He first name Zhao\u2014had still been lazing in bed an hour ago. When Xie Yu had called him, he had said he was going to go back to sleep again.Then he had said in a low voice, \u201cSee you in my dreams.\u201d[jsdhwdmax]: On the railing?Xie Yu sent the message and the figure immediately looked down at his phone.After this confirmation, Xie Yu walked over, clutching his own mock paper. A few paces away, he raised the booklet and tapped the person\u2019s shoulder with it.Then, without any warning, Xie Yu caught sight of his boyfriend\u2019s face.The boyfriend who had said, \u201cSee you in my dreams.\u201dHe Zhao\u2019s fingers were still on his phone screen, the message, \u2018Yes that\u2019s me,\u2019 not yet sent. The Question King PM interface was very recognizable\u2014formulas were rolling across the announcement marquee.He Zhao turned and was stunned speechless.Even though he had covered his face, He Zhao could instantly recognize his little friend in a crowd. Xie Yu radiated aloofness; he was a central air-conditioner, a walking pack of gunpowder.He Zhao\u2019s grip on his phone slipped and he nearly fell off the railing.The word \u2018fuck,\u2019 ordinarily harsh, intense and full of complicated meaning, now seemed too placid for this long and intense eye contact.Xie Yu\u2019s hand was still frozen.He didn\u2019t like the cold, so he often kept his sleeves pulled over his hands, revealing only the lower half of his fingers. The mock exam, rolled up into a long thin booklet, was currently also facing He Zhao: on it was clearly written Difficult High School Math: Booklet A.Xie Yu\u2019s mind had gone completely blank.He steadied himself. Some memories of He Zhao\u2019s actions now emerged one after another. The figure in front of him was Zero-Point Essay Contender He Zhaovsky, his magnum opus was My Silhouette is Damn Suave, he had once broken Liyang Erzhong\u2019s record for lowest exam score with a 10-point math paper, and was always last in the year\u2026All this information arranged itself in Xie Yu\u2019s mind where explosions were going off.He Zhao was stunned, too. As he jumped down from the railing, he felt as if he was floating and he almost didn\u2019t land properly.Then he coughed and picked a very awkward conversation starter. \u201cMy friend\u2026 you look familiar.\u201dXie Yu said, \u201cDo I.\u201dHe Zhao said, \u201cYou look very like my boyfriend.\u201dBefore He Zhao was done, Xie Yu had already started calmly folding up his sleeves.Really\u2026 very annoying.A pile of question marks choked him.The image of the idiot star student with glasses as thick as the bottom of a beer bottle now transformed into that of his own boyfriend.His boyfriend, whom he had worried day in and day out would end up an excavator operator after the college exams. His boyfriend, whose grades even a thirty-day miracle brain medicine course would not be able to drag back up to a passing level.\u201cPick a place,\u201d Xie Yu said, after folding up his sleeves. \u201cIf here isn\u2019t too embarrassing for you, here\u2019s fine, too.\u201dHe Zhao: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe Zhao was that close to being murdered.If he hadn\u2019t happened to overhear someone asking, \u201cHello, may I ask where the entrance to the Question King Offline Meetup is?\u201d he might really have died.Xue Xisheng had tidied himself up and even put on a layer of greasy hair cream. He looked very energetic. Black spectacle frames and a checkered button-down shirt.He also carried many books. Xie Yu glanced over and saw Beautiful Chemistry and Happy Physics.Xie Yu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe Zhao: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter a pause, He Zhao said stiffly, \u201cRun?\u201d\u201cRun,\u201d Xie Yu replied. \u201cOr were you planning to go up and say hi?\u201dThe elderly janitor Xue Xisheng had stopped clearly wasn\u2019t aware this activity was taking place. \u201cAh? What Quest King?\u201dXue Xisheng said, \u201cQuestion King Tournament. A studying game. Today is our networking event.\u201dThe janitor shook his head, bent down, and kept sweeping. He said, \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026 I\u2019m old and I don\u2019t understand what you young people are playing these days. Never heard of it.\u201dXue Xisheng said, \u201cSorry, I\u2019ll let you get back to work.\u201d Then he looked up and glimpsed two silhouettes, but they had already vanished through a door to the side before he could take a closer look.Although neither Xie Yu nor He Zhao understood what was going on, they both were in agreement that the study rep had to be avoided. So they found a chance and escaped through the side door.There were more people inside Century City than outside and there was a crowd waiting for the elevator. They probably wouldn\u2019t be able to get in until the third or fourth time it arrived.So He Zhao made a split-second decision, pushed open the emergency door, and went for the stairs.They ran up the stairs, clutching onto the railings. They ran fast, and who knew how many floors they climbed. Just turning the corners made their heads spin.While dizzy, Xie Yu suddenly remembered that Baidu Q&amp;A. What to do when boyfriend doesn\u2019t study. My boyfriend is an angel but he\u2019s second-to-last place in school.The \u2018Handsome He\u2019 who lost all his hit points in that math class.On the bus, He Zhao had said when he passed the tchotchke store, \u201cI\u2019ve come here before.\u201d\u2026\u2026And even further back, the messy circle drawn on the paper crane.It had been a 0.Xie Yu stopped running, panting lightly. He tore off his mask, leaving it hanging from one side of his face, then leaned against the wall and said, \u201cAll right\u2026 stop running.\u201dThe emergency stairwell was silent, both upstairs and downstairs. Everyone else was waiting for the elevator, and even those taking the stairs wouldn\u2019t come up this far.He Zhao plopped down on the landing and thought about this whole matter between the two of them. He flat-out couldn\u2019t remember the string of keysmash Xie Yu used for a handle, so he asked, \u201cYou\u2019re that something-something-X?\u201dXie Yu retorted, \u201cYou\u2019re Shameless?\u201dHe Zhao scratched his head. He thought he was good at rolling with things, but he was completely helpless right now. He changed the subject again. \u201cWho\u2019s the study rep?\u201dXie Yu had temporarily lost his ability to think and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know. Could be anyone.\u201dOn second thought, it made complete sense that Xue Xisheng used Question King. In all of Erzhong, no one was as hardworking or as focused on studying as him.In his free time, he was either memorizing vocabulary or doing problem sets.The two fell silent again.Then Xie Yu clamped down on all his feelings and handed his mock paper over. \u201cDid you bring a pen?\u201dHe Zhao was thinking the same thing. If they didn\u2019t do these mock papers on the spot, neither of them would believe this unbelievable coincidence.This was too goddamn\u2026Too damned.He Zhao took the paper and tossed Best of the College Exams over. \u201cYup, I brought one. You\u2026 pick a set.\u201dWhen Xie Yu left school, he had not imagined that one hour later he would be sitting in an emergency stairwell with He Zhao doing mock papers. Or that He Zhao, perpetually last place in the year, would tell him, \u201cThis mock paper is too easy\u2026\u201d\u201cYour mock paper is idiotic.\u201d A vein throbbed at Xie Yu\u2019s temple.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Out of habit, he glanced over the paper from start to finish and got a general sense of the difficulty before he started writing. He began drafting a solution in the blank space.His mind was in disarray and his handwriting was unsteady too.He sat on the first step of the flight of ascending stairs while Xie Yu sat in the corner of the bend in the stairwell. They sat face to face, one higher and one lower.While drafting his answers, He Zhao remembered what he had said to Xie Yu under the alias \u2018Question King.\u2019None of it was very polite.He Zhao was very distracted. His pen moved over the thin paper, writing down the square root of 2, then stopped. Ink gradually spread out from where the nib met paper, and as He Zhao stared at the spreading black ink blob, he thought about the most dastardly thing he had said. He said it aloud now: \u201c\u2026I\u2019ll give you a three-question head start.\u201dXie Yu still hadn\u2019t removed his hood. He had also lowered his head, so from He Zhao\u2019s position he could only see Xie Yu\u2019s nose and chin. His mouth was set in a thin line and he didn\u2019t seem to be in a good mood.How could his mood possibly be good?Xie Yu squeezed the pen in his hand. It actually seemed more likely that he would meet this idiot in a dream. Perhaps this really was a dream.Xie Yu slowly exhaled on his question paper. \u201cAll right, give me the headstart. Then I\u2019ll give you a ten-question headstart.\u201dHe Zhao: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe two last-places-in-the-year, who slept in class or played phone games, who dragged Class 3\u2019s average grades so far down that every subject teacher was a step away from jumping off a cliff, who never even knew which page of the textbook they were going through in class\u2014were now sitting in the stairwell trashtalking each other.In school, their most frequent conversation was, \u201cWhich question is the teacher going over?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t know.\u201d \u201cDo you know how to do this question?\u201d \u201cNope.\u201d \u201cPhew, you don\u2019t know, either. Did you finish copying the homework?\u201dNow, after the trash talk, even Xie Yu felt shocked.He had looked through the Best of the College Exams He Zhao had brought, and all the mock papers looked about equally difficult, so he tore a set out at random. He glanced at the time, then tossed his phone to the floor.Half an hour. They stopped writing around 11 a.m.Since Xie Yu had still not seen He Zhao\u2019s answers, he remained suspicious. Even though an inexplicable notion was currently bubbling up in his mind.He Zhao did two questions, emotions still in disarray.He held his pen, knuckles jutting out. He stared at his terrible, shaky handwriting. Then, still dazed, he switched his pen to his left hand.When Xie Yu finished writing, it was not yet 11 a.m. He glanced up and saw the idiot on the steps had also just stopped writing. He Zhao put his paper on his knee and looked at Xie Yu.They stared at each other quietly for a while.Xie Yu went to sit on the step too, taking the mock paper with him. He reached out for the paper on He Zhao\u2019s knee, but He Zhao held it in place with one hand, then caught hold of Xie Yu\u2019s hand with the other. He said quietly, \u201cCan you\u2026 let me off this once?\u201d\u201cWeren\u2019t you so sure of yourself?\u201d Xie Yu said, pulling the paper out little by little from underneath He Zhao\u2019s hand. He got it halfway out, then couldn\u2019t pull it any further. He said, \u201cLet go.\u201dXie Yu was still internally thinking this was impossible, but upon seeing the paper\u2026 he was speechless.The first few lines were written in ugly handwriting, but the rest of it\u2026 the handwriting was still messy, but in a sharp, imposing manner. Firm, and beautiful in an unrestrained way. They could have been written by a completely different person than had written the first few lines.Xie Yu wasn\u2019t sure what to say. He flipped the page and looked again to make sure his eyes were not deceiving him.\u201cI\u2019m left-handed.\u201d He Zhao explained a little nervously. \u201cAlthough I write fine with my right hand, too. The style\u2019s just a little different. I\u2019m much more bold and carefree when I write with my left\u2026\u201dSince a young age, He Zhao had found it easier to use his left hand, but his parents had made him train his right hand, thinking it would be easier to correct him while he was young. Time went on, and his lefty tendencies remained unobtrusive.\u201cCorrection. You\u2019re much more dogshit.\u201dXie Yu thought, since he dares call himself Question King, it\u2019s not that surprising that his handwriting is nicer, too. Professionalism. He\u2019s living up to his handle completely. But Xie Yu was still annoyed for some reason he didn\u2019t understand. He continued, \u201cI don\u2019t think you understand what \u2018bold and carefree\u2019 means.\u201dHalf an hour was not much time to answer questions. He Zhao had condensed his answers and completed three steps in one. He only used half the available space to answer the question\u2014he had calculated the answer in his working area, then put a circle around it and called it a solution.Xie Yu started examining the paper, starting with the first question, all the way through to the end. Aside from the final question, on which He Zhao had dropped a decimal point, there were no mistakes.He Zhao was looking at Xie Yu\u2019s paper, too.He glanced it over and saw that his boyfriend had really left the first ten questions blank.He had really given He Zhao a 10-question head start. How arrogant.But He Zhao kept reading. Every solution was elegant, simple, and to the point.He Zhao had seen \u2018God X\u2019 doing problem sets. His logical thought process couldn\u2019t be faked. His approach to answering, his habit of underlining the key points in a question\u2026 were all identical to what was on this mock paper in front of him.He Zhao finished checking the answers. He still wasn\u2019t sure if he could believe it, but the facts were right there in front of him.\u2014Only now did Xie Yu notice something uncontrollably bubbling forth in his mind. He couldn\u2019t name it. Aside from shock, the most he could say about it was\u2014although he thought the person in front of him was an idiot, it turned out he himself was an even bigger idiot.He Zhao opened his mouth, but before he could say anything, Xie Yu folded up his sleeves and said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure what to say about this, but let\u2019s go a few rounds.\u201dHe Zhao said, \u201cLet\u2019s not. Violence doesn\u2019t solve anything. Let\u2019s sit down and calmly\u2026\u201dXie Yu was already in motion before the words \u2018talk it out\u2019 left He Zhao\u2019s mouth.He Zhao pushed himself off the stairs with one hand and backed away to the side, but before he could find his footing a punch came flying his way.A merciless punch, trailing wind.The stairwell was cramped and neither of them could move freely. Although neither of them were fighting their best, they weren\u2019t playing around, either. Especially Xie Yu, the little hooligan of Black Water Street who never bothered with bullshit talk when he could fight instead, and who had grown up pinning everyone with a problem he couldn\u2019t solve to the ground.While taking the beating, He Zhao thought, My boyfriend is really damn cute when he skips the talk and goes straight for the fight.Xie Yu started off brutally attacking, then slowly let up. He Zhao, obliging, pulled Xie Yu into his arms. He trapped his disobedient little friend, then kissed him.Xie Yu was self-righteous and very haughty, but his lips were very soft.Xie Yu\u2019s back was to the wall, the loose hood of his jacket covering his forehead and blocking his vision. The strongest sensation he felt was the hand at his waist and how He Zhao was plundering his lips and teeth, willful, harsh, and invasive.The stairwell was very narrow.Several floors below, people were coming and going, and the sound of their footsteps echoed up from below through the winding corridor.\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say either.\u201dHe Zhao hadn\u2019t completely let go of him, and now his lips moved slightly, brushing against Xie Yu\u2019s own. When he spoke, he lifted his hand to pull down the hood on Xie Yu\u2019s head. \u201cCome on. Let me kiss you for another twenty minutes then.\u201d\u201cGet lost.\u201dAfter this tussle, the feelings he had not been able to contain since meeting He Zhao at the Century City entrance, and again when he saw He Zhao\u2019s near-perfect-score mock paper, now finally subsided.They sat side by side on the steps, gathering their own thoughts.Xie Yu rubbed at the corner of his mouth with one finger; he hurt from being kissed. After steadying himself, he asked, \u201cDo you have a cigarette?\u201d\u201cLittle kids shouldn\u2019t smoke.\u201d He Zhao pulled out a lollipop from his pocket that was wrapped in distracting pink packaging. He held on to the stick and asked, \u201c\u2026Compromise?\u201dXie Yu took it and unwrapped the paper.\u201cWhat on earth are you doing?\u201d Halfway through unwrapping, Xie Yu thought again about the study guide he had spent so much time putting together. \u201cDo you know how much I goddamn\u2026 to put together that\u2026\u201dHe Zhao cut him off. \u201cSecond-to-last place in the year. What on earth are you doing?\u201dAfter mentioning the two study guide emails, Xie Yu stopped himself. Then he thought about the Complete Guide to the College Exams that had mysteriously appeared on his desk. Something didn\u2019t seem right. He was onto something.\u201cYou bought the books?\u201dHe Zhao, mulling over the words \u2018put together,\u2019 also remembered something. \u201cYou sent the email?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dXie Yu said nothing and crumpled the candy wrapper in his palm.Fuck. What the hell is all of this?After going in a big circle, it turned out they both had worried over nothing.He Zhao leaned back on his hands, the corner of the step digging into his hand, and he suddenly wanted to laugh. \u201cI thought\u2026 it\u2019s because Wan Da and the others made it sound like it was really true.\u201dXie Yu said, \u201cTrue, my ass. They went so far off track and you still believed them?\u201dThe footsteps several floors below, which had gone on for a while, now finally stopped.The stairwell felt a little empty.He Zhao hid his smile. He looked downward from where he sat on the stairs and was silent for a while before saying, \u201cDo you remember, the last time when we went to Dian Ji to eat and we ran into someone called Ji-ge?\u201dXie Yu, chewing the sweet, mumbled \u2018Mm\u2019 with his mouth full.He Zhao had thought that matter would stay locked up in his heart and there would never come a day where he volunteered that story.He had locked it up so tightly it lost its shape.It stuck in his chest. Couldn\u2019t go up and couldn\u2019t go down.It had already been a few years and many of the details had faded from He Zhao\u2019s memory with time. But every time he thought he had forgotten it, on some night of some day, he would wake up in a cold sweat.He finished telling the story all at once and didn\u2019t dare look at Xie Yu\u2019s face.Would his little friend look down on him for it? Would he be disappointed in him? Would he\u2026He Zhao kept thinking and didn\u2019t notice that he was pushing down harder and harder against the step, the hard edge leaving a deep impression in his hand.Xie Yu didn\u2019t say, \u2018It\u2019s nothing, and you\u2019re not to blame,\u2019 but he also didn\u2019t say, \u2018You were wrong.\u2019 He didn\u2019t blame, but he didn\u2019t comfort, either.He Zhao was getting more and more uncertain, but then Xie Yu took hold of the narrow plastic stick and pulled the lollipop from his mouth. Then he put it to He Zhao\u2019s lips.\u201cGe, want some?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His mind had been running wild, but when he heard this he glanced sharply up.Xie Yu had not reacted strongly.Before He Zhao could respond, Xie Yu forcibly shoved the sweet into his mouth.He Zhao froze.Then the fruity taste reached him.It was sweet.His little friend had licked it.And his little friend had called him \u2018ge.\u2019All other thoughts in He Zhao\u2019s mind suddenly screeched to a stop and only one thing remained: \u2026he\u2019s playing dirty.Xie Yu had never imagined that \u2018Question King\u2019 had nearly given up on himself for such a reason. Even after repeating a year, He Zhao hadn\u2019t been able to put down his worries and had landed himself at a bottom-of-the-barrel high school and kept scoring last in the year at that.A top student, who in the eyes of everyone had a bright and limitless future, had now fallen below the passing grade.He had fallen very far.Even though Xie Yu had known He Zhao for a long time, the only time he had really seen He Zhao get angry was during the incident with Xu Xia and Goody-two-shoes Yang.\u201cThat\u2019s why you beat people up in your first year, too?\u201d Xie Yu leaned back on his hands and asked.Xie Yu didn\u2019t pay attention to gossip and had no idea who the Big Bro in the next building was. But He Zhao\u2019s exploits had spread through the entire school and it was difficult to avoid it completely.Xie Yu had become the Big Bro of the West Building due to \u2018cheating on the high school exams\u2019 on top of fighting.He Zhao, on the other hand, hadn\u2019t.Unlike Xie Yu, when He Zhao entered high school, he had maintained a low profile for a while. He had attended class for two months without incident. Then, after the mid-term tests, an event had made his name spread like wildfire.He hit a teacher.Like Xie Yu, he had made his name by fighting, but what He Zhao had done was much more serious than Xie Yu knocking four people unconscious outside of school.\u201cAbout that\u2026\u201d\u201cSomeone in our class had bought exam answers, and he thought I gave that person the idea.\u201d He Zhao bit into the sweet. Unwilling to even mention the teacher\u2019s name, he had said \u2018he\u2019 instead. Then He Zhao continued, \u201cHe seems to have thought highly of me. Buying answers, my ass\u2026 if I really had, would I really have scored ten points?\u201dNow that He Zhao thought about it, he had been too hot-tempered at that time. He could have just laughed it off. He hadn\u2019t really needed to kick the table and then argue back. The argument had grown more and more heated until He Zhao couldn\u2019t hold himself back any longer and threw a punch.He had hit quite hard and nearly landed the teacher in the hospital.That day, He Zhao didn\u2019t leave school after class was dismissed. He sat in a bathroom stall and smoked half a pack of cigarettes. While the smell of smoke circulated around him, he kept asking himself, What the hell am I doing?He Zhao now stopped. Noticing that the \u2018second-to-last-in-the-year\u2019 sitting next to him had not yet said a word, he changed the topic. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d Xie Yu said calmly. \u201cI\u2019m too outstanding. I want to give other people a chance, too.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d He Zhao choked. He lifted a hand and tousled Xie Yu\u2019s hair. \u201cBe more serious, will you?\u201dXie Yu\u2019s reasons\u2026 were domestic.He Zhao already knew of Xie Yu\u2019s \u2018intellectually impaired\u2019 older brother. He Zhao had also seen his little friend pace back and forth in the dormitory corridor, impressively cursing up a storm without repeating a single insult.Xie Yu, seeing He Zhao about to say something, cut him off again. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. I know what I\u2019m going to do.\u201dZhong Guofei had told Xie Yu that his son was competitive. Xie Yu had not taken it to heart and nearly told Zhong Guofei on the spot, It\u2019s none of my damn business if your son\u2019s competitive. Not like he\u2019s my son.But Xie Yu also had to worry about Madam Gu.While Xie Yu was still unable to leave this home environment, he had to protect her as much as he could, by any means necessary.Although He Zhao thought his little friend sounded cool with things, he was still a little worried. \u201cSo what are your plans? What university are you aiming for?\u201dXie Yu replied, \u201cDoesn\u2019t have to be too great. Tsinghua or Peking U is fine.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe Zhao was speechless.Remembering the question he had posted on Baidu Knows, He Zhao now thought he had been completely absurd.They sat in the stairwell a while longer. Xie Yu glanced at the time; it was nearly time for lunch. He stood up and kicked He Zhao\u2019s leg, then walked up the stairs. \u201cAre you hungry? Want to go for lunch?\u201dHe Zhao crunched up the sweet in his mouth and looked at him. \u201cIt\u2019s a date.\u201dSince confirming their relationship, they had both been in school most of the time and they were both occupied on weekends.On the occasions they left school for fun, it was mostly for group activities and they couldn\u2019t ignore an entire 30-odd group of third wheels. Aside from the time He Zhao had gone off to Black Water Street to find him, which could perhaps be considered a date if one really tried, they really hadn\u2019t had much time together.Xie Yu pulled open the heavy door of the emergency exit. Hearing the words \u2018It\u2019s a date,\u2019 he paused.They were on the seventh floor. If he had gone up two more flights, they would have reached the top floor.They left the emergency stairwell. This floor of the shopping mall consisted of furniture stores. There weren\u2019t many people this high up. So they looked for an elevator to go down again. He Zhao hung off Xie Yu\u2019s shoulder as they walked and he asked, \u201cWhat do couples do when they go on dates?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201d\u201cThis is my first relationship. I\u2019m not used to things yet.\u201d\u201cAsk Baidu, then. Don\u2019t you like doing that?\u201dHe Zhao fell silent. \u201c\u2026That\u2019s enough. You\u2019ll never let me forget it, will you?\u201dHaving been mercilessly shot down by Xie Yu, He Zhao did pick up his phone and look on Baidu.The previous elevator had just left and was still on the ground floor. They would have to wait a while longer before it arrived again.Xie Yu held his mock paper in one hand. Bored of waiting, he leaned over to look at He Zhao\u2019s phone screen, and saw a very embarrassing heading: Dating Walkthrough. How to firmly catch hold of his/her heart.\u201cHave a meal, watch a movie\u2026\u201d He Zhao read aloud as he scrolled. After reading a few lines, he stopped and said, \u201c\u2026About watching a movie, I\u2019ll see anything with you as long as it\u2019s not a horror film.\u201dAside from these general tips, the site also had restaurant recommendations and tips for what to look out for while having a meal. Through the little details, embody the chivalry and romance of a gentleman, and entrance your partner with your presence.Xie Yu glanced downward and caught sight of a subject title at the very end of the article, annotated in red text: Final Stage.He Zhao finished reading the content, then kept scrolling downward. His finger stopped on the final paragraph and he also saw the text in red. He read the title aloud, then got stuck. \u201cGet a\u2026\u201dGet a room.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe lights on the elevator indicated it was about to reach their floor.He Zhao swallowed and turned his phone off.Xie Yu said nothing, but although he looked calm on the surface, He Zhao noticed that the tips of Xie Yu\u2019s ears had gone red.With a chime, the elevator doors opened.Xie Yu felt that something was wrong with him, although he couldn\u2019t pinpoint what.Thoughts were rising in his mind, unstoppable despite his efforts.He Zhao coughed and changed the subject. \u201cShall we go eat?\u201dWhile they were looking for a restaurant, they also carefully looked around for Xue Xisheng.After lunch, they walked to the entertainment area and found it was so crowded that they\u2019d get lost in the crowd if they let go of each other\u2019s hands.Fate really would be at work If they ran into Xue Xisheng again here.\u201cHe\u2019s probably attending the session on sharing your thoughts about studying.\u201d Xie Yu recalled the timestamped agenda on the invitation. \u201cHe\u2019s also doing a presentation on Happy Physics.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d He Zhao hadn\u2019t looked closely at the agenda before and was genuinely impressed. \u201cIs he human?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. We\u2019re different.\u201dThe entertainment area consisted of an arcade and a theater.The theater was crowded and the line for tickets was long.Xie Yu looked first for movies that were starting soon, then checked whether they were horror films. He ignored the others. Eventually, he picked a braincell-killing sci-fi film that started in ten minutes.He Zhao had discovered the last time they had gone shopping that Xie Yu didn\u2019t dither at all. If he saw something he wanted, he went for it. He was very focused on his objective. \u201cThat one?\u201dXie Yu had no real preference for which film to see. \u201cIf you want to see another one, that\u2019s fine too.\u201d\u201cThis one\u2019s fine,\u201d He Zhao said. \u201cThey\u2019re all about the same.\u201d And he probably wouldn\u2019t be paying attention to the movie anyway.They were buying tickets fairly late and most of the good seats were already gone, leaving only the last few rows free.From the back of the theater, the audience seating was a sea of the backs of people\u2019s heads.Xie Yu sat down, then held out his hand to He Zhao, palm up. The red bracelet still hung on his wrist, eye-catching. \u201cHold my hand, ge?\u201dHe Zhao noticed that when Xie Yu was in a good mood, he liked to give He Zhao a hard time.The theater was very noisy.Only when the lights dimmed in the theater and the movie started playing did everyone settle down.The plot was familiar and cliche, the sort where the trailer was a hundred times more exciting than the actual movie. Only the acting of the two leads and the special effects carried the film. The movie-goers watched in silence for a while, but less than half an hour in, they all noticed that the movie was boring and started chatting.The movie had very loud audio effects. The sound rose, then slowly faded.The light from the screen illuminated the theater.In this faint light, Xie Yu stared at He Zhao for a while. He moved his fingers, still intertwined with He Zhao\u2019s, and called, \u201cZhao-ge.\u201dHe Zhao turned to look at him.Xie Yu was curled up in his seat. Dressed in all black, he blended in with his surroundings, but his eyes were still bright and fixed on He Zhao. \u201cYou asked me\u2026 what you were like.\u201dOn the big screen, scene after scene went by.He Zhao was distracted by the movie\u2019s sound effects and had to think about it for a while before remembering what Xie Yu\u2019s sudden mention of \u2018last time\u2019 referred to.\u201cNow that I\u2019m not just anyone else to you.\u201d Xie Yu finished, paused, then kept going. \u201cI\u2019ll answer that question again. I\u2019ll say it once and if you don\u2019t hear it, then forget about it.\u201dHe Zhao stopped breathing.Then he heard Xie Yu say, \u201cYou\u2019re the type I like.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His tone was still cold and he leaned against the back of his chair, watching He Zhao without another sound. In his other hand was the iced Coke he had bought at the door, still radiating a chill.You are He Zhao.Just the way you are. Nothing else matters.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d He Zhao\u2019s hand gradually tightened on Xie Yu\u2019s. He Zhao was wondering if he had heard wrong, and coaxed, \u201cSay it again?\u201dXie Yu said, \u201cI advise you not to push it.\u201dHe Zhao had worn casual clothes today and hadn\u2019t even put on his audacious ear studs.Even so, he drew attention.The lighting in the theater was bad and it was very dark in the last row. Some people turned around to look at them, and there had been continued whispers ever since they entered the theater.On the bus back, Xie Yu couldn\u2019t recall what the movie had been about. He Zhao had leaned toward him during the movie despite the armrest between them and stolen away all his breath in the faint flickering light of the screen.His movements had been hurried and frantic, like he was colliding with him.He was not fazed at all kissing him in public, completely heedless of whether people would see.The sounds of the movie grew further and further away.The sounds of the movie and the chattering in the theater aside, only He Zhao\u2019s carefully restrained, murmured words remained. \u201c\u2026kill me.\u201dNear the end of the movie, the male and female lead had overcome all their obstacles and embraced.Xie Yu leaned back in his seat, putting some distance between him and He Zhao, and asked hoarsely, \u201cAre you going back to school later?\u201dHe Zhao glanced down at his pants and made sure his sweater covered it, making it not too obvious, then said, \u201cI\u2019m going home. The school locks its doors at 4:30pm and I won\u2019t make it.\u201dErzhong was strict about curfew, especially on the weekends. To prevent students from staying out too long and getting into trouble, the school gates closed punctually at 4:30 p.m.Xie Yu didn\u2019t know what He Zhao was looking at and followed his gaze. His eyes landed on the same thing and he paused for a second.\u201cYou\u2019re hard?\u201d\u201cWouldn\u2019t be a man if I wasn\u2019t.\u201d He Zhao pulled the hem of his jacket down again and said, \u201cDon\u2019t look at me. Let me rest for a bit.\u201dBuses arrived frequently at Century City, one every ten minutes or so. Not long after they got on the bus\u2014it had not even left the street Century City was on\u2014Madam Gu, anxious, called Xie Yu. \u201cDidn\u2019t you say you\u2019d be back soon\u2026 look at the time now. Are you eating dinner at home tonight or not?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m on the bus.\u201d\u201cAll you do on the weekend is play. You said you were with a classmate\u2014which classmate? When will you settle down and study properly? How much longer till you get home?\u201dXie Yu deliberately ignored half her words and just answered, \u201cHalf an hour.\u201dMadam Gu reminded him again to mind his safety, then kept lecturing him. Xie Yu listened quietly.The feeling of, \u2018I just secretly went on a date with my boyfriend,\u2019 was getting stronger and stronger. It wasn\u2019t a big deal. They had just done the usual, and had a meal and saw a movie. But Xie Yu felt that they had both done something incredible.Madam Gu put down the phone. Xie Yu looked down, about to open his music app and listen to some music to pass the time, but he saw on his home screen that a certain chat app displayed 99 unread notifications.He tapped in and found that Class 3 was having an unusually animated discussion. Even Old Tang and Wu Zheng, the teachers who usually left the class group chat alone, had been drawn out.[Luo Wenqiang]: @InteriorAnglesOfAParallelLineTransversalAreSupplementary, hey, study rep, can we talk? I\u2019m so curious what you just posted on your QQ.[Wan Da]: I want to know too. How shocking. I understand too little about this world we live in.[Liu Cunhao]: What\u2019s this about? I\u2019m going to see.Liu Cunhao disappeared for a few minutes, then came back screaming.[Liu Cunhao]:\u2026\u2026[Liu Cunhao]: My god!! What the hell!!!Old Tang had not been looking at his QQ notifications, and by the time he arrived in the chat, the key points of the conversation were far enough up in the conversation history he didn\u2019t see them. Calmly, he sent a question mark.[Mr. Tang]: ?[Mr. Wu Zheng]: What is this?[Wan Da]: Teach, come on, look at this too. [/Image][Luo Wenqiang]: Study rep is superhuman.The screenshot was of Xue Xisheng\u2019s QQ page.Xue Xisheng didn\u2019t often put up pictures on his feed or use many emoji. He mostly posted things like Compilations of High School Math Facts, Elegant Chemistry Experiments, or Ten Ways to Study Effectively.The screenshot was of Xue Xisheng\u2019s feed, where he had posted a heartfelt description of his encounter with the Question King Tournament app. He thanked the developers for organizing the offline meetup, then described in meandering prose his exciting day.\u2014During summer vacation, I was walking down the street when a flyer unexpectedly opened the door to studying. Everyone here loves learning and I could feel my heart beating wildly\u2026TopTenInClass\u2019s presentation on his study methods was very useful to me. Now, I also want to make use of small pockets of time. The Birth of Einstein was a very exciting film and everyone cried at the end. The spirit never dies and learning never ends.My only regret is that I did not personally witness the showdown between God X and Question King.\u2026\u2026After the wall of text, there was even a picture.It was a group photo of ten or so people each with a book in their hand, smiling at the camera.Xie Yu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dXue Xisheng didn\u2019t often check his phone while he was studying and only appeared in the chat after Class 3 had finished their heated discussion and was calming down.[InteriorAnglesOfAParallelLineTransversalAreSupplementary]: ?[InteriorAnglesOfAParallelLineTransversalAreSupplementary]: It\u2019s a study app. Very interesting.Seeing the words \u2018study app,\u2019 Xie Yu remembered that to them, the showdown between God X and Question King had not yet reached a conclusion.He hesitated a while, then tapped on the Apple of Knowledge icon.Unexpectedly, the chat area was very calm and even seemed quite happy. The last time Xie Yu had seen the chat this happy was during summer vacation when he knocked Question King off first place.[StudystudystudythatsallIdo]: I told you! God X is stronger![TopTenInClass]: I really want to see the study god do questions in person.[985211]: Never expected it to turn out this way. Not in a million years\u2026Xie Yu got the faint impression that something was off.He opened his friends list. He Zhao had changed his signature from \u2018Victory is mine\u2019 to \u2018I admit defeat. God X, let me live.\u2019The bus reached an intersection. The light was red and it slowed to a stop.Xie Yu leaned against the window, smiled, and cursed, \u201cIdiot.\u201dErzhong\u2019s school anniversary celebration was next month.There was still ample time to prepare, but after the novelty of the program had passed, they all grew lax at rehearsing. Even Luo Wenqiang, who had shaken his butt while cleaning the windows, had lost his enthusiasm.The moment Xie Yu stepped into class, he met the arts rep who clearly had something to say to him. Xie Yu stood in the doorway looking at her. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201dXu Jing was about to say something, then stopped.He Zhao had gotten there early, and now he sat in his seat with his leg up on the chair and said, \u201cShe wanted to ask if you practised the dance at home over the weekend. \u2026No need to ask, of course you didn\u2019t.\u201dNot only did Xie Yu not practice, he had completely forgotten about it. \u201cWhat dance?\u201dXu Jing was completely despondent. \u201cCoolest Guy Group in the Universe. We agreed we\u2019d make a bang. We agreed that this was our dream.\u201dLiu Cunhao had gone home over the weekend, and had played video games the whole time. While he collected homework, he said, \u201cAbout that\u2026 Wan Da, did you?\u201dWan Da said, \u201cI can\u2019t bear to say it. Next.\u201dLuo Wenqiang was still eating breakfast: he had a bag of meat buns in his hand. He swallowed his mouthful of food with much difficulty, then made excuses for everyone. \u201cAbout that\u2026 we\u2019re all very easily satisfied. We all daydream about it in the chat and that\u2019s enough for us.\u201dThe classroom was noisy. Some were reading aloud from their textbooks and others were copying homework.Mad Dog walked past their window twice.Each time he went past, the classroom went silent for a while.\u201cWell said, well said. With contentment comes happiness.\u201d Liu Cunhao clapped, then counted the homework and found that although He Zhao had arrived to class early, he hadn\u2019t turned in anything. Liu Cunhao called, \u201cZhao-ge, your physics homework? Yu-ge, yours, too.\u201dXie Yu had just put his things down, and now he bent and looked in his desk for his physics exercise book.This was the homework from last Thursday. It was just two pages, but he hadn\u2019t done much of it\u2014more than half the questions were blank, and the ones he did answer, he had answered incorrectly.Before he could take the book out, He Zhao held his hand in place.Xie Yu glanced at He Zhao\u2019s hand. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re so unprofessional,\u201d He Zhao said in a whisper. \u201cYou\u2019re just going to turn it in?\u201dXie Yu was slow to react.He had left questions blank and made mistakes all over. This was a homework set that might make the physics teacher call him to the office and personally instruct him.Before Xie Yu could make heads or tails of it, he heard He Zhao say to Liu Cunhao, \u201cThere was physics homework?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dLiu Cunhao was speechless, but he had also completely expected it. He pulled an exercise book from the stack at random and tossed it to He Zhao. \u201cPage 56. Quickly. I have to turn it in before class starts.\u201dHe had thrown accurately. He Zhao caught it and whistled. \u201cNo problem. Two minutes is all I need.\u201d\u201cHow about that.\u201d He Zhao found a pen and spread his hands; he would just copy a few questions for show. \u201cImpressive?\u201dXie Yu put a hand to his temple. \u201cImpressive.\u201dOld Wu hadn\u2019t had enough of the gossip from yesterday\u2019s class group chat. Before the class bell rang to signal the start of the math self-study period, he inquired about it again. After hearing the class\u2019s piecemeal explanations, he said, \u201cIs that so? The app sounds quite good. You should all go download it.\u201dLuo Wenqiang said, \u201cAh, no, no, no, teach. It doesn\u2019t suit us.\u201dLiu Cunhao said, \u201cCan\u2019t do it.\u201dWan Da said, \u201cI\u2019ll die before I do it.\u201dThe discussion grew more and more intense until the class bell rang. Old Wu rapped on the podium. \u201cAll right, class is starting. For self-study today I\u2019ll go over a very tough question.\u201dBefore Wu Zheng had finished speaking, He Zhao turned and asked, \u201cJoin a game?\u201dWhile they were playing, the team chat grew somewhat strange.[Handsome He]: There are three solutions to that question.[xy]: Two. Where did you pull that third one from?[Handsome He]: Take the midpoint of the diagonal and join to point F. Look again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 100": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fake SlackersChapter 077 - The answer you gavePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayFake SlackersTranslator: JuryEditor: NomNomFirst Published on Chaleuria\u2014077 \u2013 The answer you gaveOld Wu finished writing the question, then drew a diagram to the side to help the class visualize the problem more clearly. He then labelled the diagram and drew some more lines.Xie Yu glanced at the board and got the gist of the third solution He Zhao had mentioned. It was workable, but it involved some unnecessary calculations and went in a few circles before arriving at the answer.[xy]: Too complicated to calculate.[Handsome He]: It\u2019s all right. Three minutes via mental math.[xy]: You\u2019re a real showoff.On the phone screen, both game avatars were surrounded by the flashing lights of skills being used. Xie Yu finished typing, then swiftly set off a chain of attacks.Following his lead, He Zhao broke through the waves of enemies surrounding them and went straight for the big boss in the back.The boss was a monster with high defense and He Zhao whaled on it for a long time before finally chipping away at its hit points. He glanced at the top right corner and saw Xie Yu\u2019s message in the team chat.[xy]: What are your plans?Xie Yu hadn\u2019t directly asked, \u2018How much longer are you going to pretend?\u2019Plans.He Zhao stared at the word \u2018plans\u2019 and his fingers suddenly stopped moving. He had been about to execute a final attack. As if possessed, he selected the healing skill instead.His game avatar stopped moving and took a healing potion on the spot.In the several seconds it took for him to do this, the tide of the battle turned.Handsome He stood to one side, healing himself, while his HP kept dropping.His hit points fell to 0 and the avatar slumped to the ground. In the same moment, He Zhao finished typing his response and sent it.[Handsome He]: I think I have the answer.He Zhao continued typing, but before he could finish, an alert popped up in the middle of his screen: Your friend Shen Jie requests to join the team.Wu Zheng\u2019s tough question now occupied two sections of the blackboard. The sounds of the class next door reciting classical poems also drifted in through the window.\u201cWhile you are all still awake, I\u2019ll go over this question with you.\u201d Wu Zheng had used up his half a stick of chalk, which was now about the length of a fingernail. He turned to get a new piece and happened to see the two students in the back row doing who-knows-what. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThis time, Wu Zheng didn\u2019t throw chalk. He made a shushing motion at the class, indicating to everyone to be silent, then picked up the ruler and walked over.Liu Cunhao held back his laughter. He made a fist with his hand, put it next to his mouth, and said to Wan Da, \u201cBet you fifty cents they die today.\u201d\u201cThat might not happen.\u201d Wan Da leaned over. \u201cZhao-ge\u2019s so full of tricks. I bet he can bounce back.\u201dSubsequent events proved that Wan Da had thought too highly of him.He Zhao still had his phone in hand. Wu Zheng walked in front of him and could see the game screen clearly. This was unshakeable evidence; He Zhao was dead meat.Wu Zheng bent to look closer. \u201cYou two lead very exciting lives.\u201dXie Yu barely managed to leave the team and hide the chat window from view.He Zhao, too.Now Wu Zheng only saw two poorly dressed avatars in the game lobby and He Zhao\u2019s notification: Your friend Shen Jie requests to join the team.Your friend Shen Jie requests to join the team.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWhen Shen Jie was called by his homeroom teacher to the faculty office, he was in a daze.He pushed open the office door and saw that his Zhao-ge and Xie Yu were also there.The Class 8 homeroom teacher sat in a relaxed position, one hand resting on the back of his chair, a red pen between his fingers. He asked mildly, \u201cAll right, explain what you were doing during self-study period this morning.\u201dShen Jie stammered, \u201cStudying hard.\u201dHe Zhao was in a good mood. The way he was standing to the side, one might think the teacher had called him up to praise him. He smiled, then said, \u201cFriend Shen Jie, please be honest. Look into my eyes and try to recall.\u201dShen Jie: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dXie Yu leaned against the wall. He had slept badly last night and had not caught up on sleep during self-study period, so now, standing in the office, he started feeling sleepy. He leaned back quietly.In the office, the various subject representatives came and went, carrying stacks of homework.They reported in: how many people did not turn the work in, or had not yet shown up to class, or had left their homework at home.The three of them stood out the most: Monday morning self-study period had not even passed and they were already standing here getting lectured.\u201cTeach, I really know what I did wrong. I should have resisted the lure of the game\u2026\u201d Shen Jie had never imagined that he would be this unlucky, but he obligingly admitted his mistake. \u201cI\u2019ll turn over a new leaf and become a new person. After today, I\u2019ll quit gaming and study hard\u2026\u201dWhile Shen Jie hung his head and admitted his mistakes, Xie Yu secretly nudged the back of He Zhao\u2019s hand and said, eyes half-closed, \u201cWhat\u2019s your answer?\u201dHe Zhao turned to look at him.He liked the way Xie Yu wore the uniform. Erzhong\u2019s uniform was very ordinary and everyone had hated it when it was first distributed. They took every chance they got not to wear the uniform and when they didn\u2019t, their confidence went up and they walked with a spring in their step.But Xie Yu wore it differently. He already looked like he didn\u2019t follow the rules, his expression both cold and frustrated, as if at any moment he would roll up his sleeves and pick a fight with you. But he still wore the uniform every day.\u201cThe answer you gave,\u201d He Zhao whispered. \u201cThe answer you gave me in the theater.\u201dAt first, He Zhao was indifferent to the notion of getting good grades and pleasing the teachers.He wasn\u2019t the sort to study night and day; he had his fun, too. He played all the popular games and joined in all the class activities.Although he caused a lot of headaches, most teachers still praised him. \u201cHe\u2019s quite good. Has character. He\u2019s a guy and he\u2019s still young, so he\u2019s a little wild\u2026\u201dNothing had changed at all.But now that his grades had dropped, he became the one his homeroom teacher accused of leading the charge in buying exam answers, and became someone Xu Xia called \u2018your sort.\u2019With the matter of Erlei on top of that, he seemed to be spiraling downward, forever, with no end in sight.Even he felt that he was rotten to the core.But although Xie Yu hadn\u2019t directly said it, that day\u2026His cold,emotionless boyfriend had held out a hand in the gentlest possible way.He hadn\u2019t undone any of the knots in He Zhao\u2019s heart, but He Zhao now felt that he had much more courage.\u2014Courage to face these things and overcome them.Shen Jie continued his apology for three minutes and was still unable to move the Class 9 homeroom teacher, who also was someone with an explosive temper. \u201cYou\u2019re not sincere enough. Go back and write a 3000-word reflection essay. Not a single word less.\u201dShen Jie said with heartfelt pain, \u201cWill do, sir.\u201dThen the Class 8 homeroom teacher waved dismissively. \u201cAll right, go back to class. I\u2019ll deal with you later.\u201dOld Tang, on the other hand, didn\u2019t say anything so cliche. He finished his work at hand, then brought both of them to the balcony, thought for a while, and said, \u201cHave you thought about what you\u2019re going to do in the future? You don\u2019t absolutely have to study. Some people study hard because they don\u2019t yet know what they\u2019re going to do, so they just do the best they can on the matters at hand to prepare for the future and wait for the things they do want to do.\u201d\u201cSome people know what they want to do, so they strive towards the future they want.\u201d\u201cWhat about you? Where do you want to go?\u201d\u201cRegardless of where you want to go, you can\u2019t just keep lying on the floor because you don\u2019t know.\u201dA strong wind blew across the balcony. Several potted plants stood to the side, under the sun, including the cactus Old Tang called Xiao Cui. He had probably been holding back this speech for a long time. He really couldn\u2019t rest easy seeing the two of them lounge about all day doing nothing.\u201cAll right, I won\u2019t make you write reflection essays.\u201d Old Tang sighed, then said, \u201cGo back to class.\u201dXie Yu walked in front.Shen Jie followed behind He Zhao. The moment he stepped out of the office, his entire demeanor changed. He tossed his head and inwardly cursed: Really damn unlucky today.\u201cZhao-ge, aren\u2019t you going to explain?\u201d Shen Jie jumped up and hooked an arm around He Zhao\u2019s neck. \u201cAren\u2019t you sorry? I\u2019m your bro\u2026\u201dHe Zhao smiled and let him keep making a fuss. He hadn\u2019t thought that Shen Jie would get implicated just by playing a game. The worst had been that Old Wu had gone straight to Class 8\u2019s homeroom teacher and said, \u201cIs there a student named Shen Jie in your class? Tell him not to keep bothering He Zhao and Xie Yu from my class and asking them to play video games.\u201dThe Class 8 homeroom teacher had protected his brood, \u201cHow can you say that? I think it\u2019s the students from your class who lured Shen Jie first.\u201dWu Zheng said, \u201cBullshit. See for yourself: request to join the team. Four or five of them. Can you read?\u201dThe two had then started quarrelling.He Zhao said, sidling out of the way, \u201cWhat\u2019s there to explain? There\u2019s nothing to explain. You were just unlucky.\u201dShen Jie was nearly a full head shorter than He Zhao, and he was going to jump up and try to get He Zhao\u2019s neck again but then he saw Xie Yu who had stopped in his tracks, both hands stuck in his pockets and leaning against the wall, glaring coldly at him.In Xie Yu\u2019s eyes was clearly written: Just try doing that again.Shen Jie: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe quietly put his hands back down. \u201cCount me unlucky, then. I\u2019m going back to class. Bye.\u201dHe Zhao waved and said, \u201cSafe trip.\u201dThen he walked up to Xie Yu and said, \u201cWhy\u2019d you stop here?\u201dXie Yu paused for a moment before saying, \u201cOld Tang.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201d He Zhao froze for two seconds and said nothing.After Old Tang had become Class 3\u2019s homeroom teacher, the atmosphere of the class had changed. While Xu Xia was there, the class had all restrained themselves, but now they said anything they wanted to in their class chat.That time they did the blackboard presentation on \u2018My Dreams,\u2019 most of them had been bullshitting, but Old Tang still spent a lot of effort looking for resources for each of them, hoping they would be able to establish their goals.Xie Yu wanted to say, People aren\u2019t the same. Old Tang isn\u2019t Xu Xia.But then he thought He Zhao must already know that.Eventually, he said, \u201cLet\u2019s go back to class, boyfriend.\u201dIn the classroom, Xu Jing was trying to get the Coolest Guy Group in the Universe to rehearse their dance. Even before entering the class, Xie Yu could hear them counting the beats. Luo Wenqiang shook his butt invitingly and everyone around him was laughing, saying, \u201cHave you thought about what you\u2019re going to wear on stage? Gym rep, just wear the costume from the sports meet. You\u2019ll be on fire. It\u2019s a waste to wear it just once.\u201dLuo Wenqiang said, \u201c\u2026Shh. Don\u2019t let Jing-jing hear it or she might come up with some new ideas.\u201dThe day of the school anniversary celebration drew closer and closer. A banner had been put up over the school gates. Aside from practicing, what Class 3 wanted most was to know what performances the other classes would be putting up. They wanted to know how strong their opponents were.Therefore, Wan Da visited all the Year 2 classrooms. Within three days, he came up with an agenda even more detailed than the official one the school had distributed.\u201cClass 7 is dancing, too. And they have awesome costumes.\u201d Between classes, several of them gathered in the back row around the agenda. Xie Yu was slumped on his desk, napping. Liu Cunhao sat in the empty seat opposite him and complained. \u201cThey\u2019re all wearing suits. Animals, the lot of them, but well-dressed ones.\u201dXie Yu couldn\u2019t sleep. As he lay with his eyes half-open, his hand found He Zhao\u2019s under the table.He Zhao wordlessly squeezed back. His little friend\u2019s fingers were slender and long, the knuckles pressing into his palm, and an idea came to him, \u201cI think we have to get a little creative.\u201dXu Jing was looking at the agenda. Still with her head bowed, she said, \u201cTell me. Creative how?\u201d\u201cFor example,\u201d He Zhao paused, then smiled again. \u201c\u2026Black nail polish.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
