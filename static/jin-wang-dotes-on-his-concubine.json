So she would do a job well as a wet nurse and never pursue luxurious life.However, it never occurred to her that stern-faced Jin Wang who only did something without saying in last life now became so initiative.Everyone in the world knew that Jin Wang had a concubine which was doted by him as early as he lived in original place. After entering the royal palace, she was even more prestigious and Jin Wang only doted her in imperial harem.There were many rumors in the folk villages about the concubine. The only thing that was well known was that before she entered the royal palace she was a widow and it was said that she also had a son.During the time Jin Wang became the emperor, he was diligent and manged the country well. He worked hard to improve his governance as a wise emperor. However, he was frequently crazy about the concubine, which made people criticize a lot.And one of the most absurd things he did was to recognize the son the concubine had as his own kid.To this, Jin Wang personally came out to refute the rumor: \u201cIt\u2019s my own son.\u201dThe weather of Jin Zhou in March was warmer but still a little chilling.The rain lasted for two days without stopping.It became cold again, and everywhere was wet. When the wind was blowing, the chill crept through the seams of people\u2019s clothes, making people shiver.Jin Wang went to border town the day before yesterday and he was not in the mansion. Yaoniang asked someone to deliver a message to her elder sister and brother-in-law that she wanted to see Xiaobao and asked them to bring him.Since she had entered Jin Wang Mansion, she hadn\u2019t seen Xiaobao for more than a year.Yaoniang was doted in the mansion, and the consort cared her much. So when Yaoniang asked someone to deliver a message, there would be many people who were willing to do. In the day, her brother-in-law Yao Cheng and her sister Huiniang took a green curtain carriage to the back door of the mansion, and Yaoniang was anxiously waiting here.\u201cIt would be better to take madam to the house. It is not convenient to stand here.\u201d The servant girl Die\u2019er said.Yaoniang also realized that there was a lot of inconvenience because of people coming and going here, and she also wanted to hug and kiss Xiaobao. So she led Huiniang who held Xiaobao in her arms into the house. As for Yao Cheng, he was a man and not suitable for entering an inner house. Naturally, some people greeted him and prepared hot tea and some food.Along the way, Yaoniang stared at Xiaobao all the time.This was her son who was born by her hardly. But she can\u2019t stay with him for many reasons. When she left, he was just an infant, but now he became older.It seemed that there was a natural blood relationship between the mother and the child. Xiaobao felt very unfamiliar when he saw Yaoniang at first glance. But staring at this beautiful woman for a long time, he suddenly laughed and held out his fat hand and wanted Yaoniang to hug him.Yaoniang\u2019s eyes were instantly red, and she took over Xiaobao, holding him tightly in her arms. She wanted to cry, but she was afraid to scare the child. So she could only bear desperately.Finally, when she had calmed down, a group people continued to move on.Huiniang followed her sister cautiously, and from time to time she looked at all the scenes of the dazzling beams and paintings in the surroundings of the most luxurious things. Even servants in the mansion looked exceptionally superior from their wearings. The Yao family was also a well-off family, but Huiniang was not able to wear such materials of clothes and such jewelry compared with servants worn.\u201cYaoyao, you asked me and your brother-in-law to bring Xiaobao here. Does Wangye know that? Will there be any inconveniences to you?\u201d They arrived at the small courtyard where Yaoniang lived. After Die\u2019er went down, and Huiniang was a little worried and she asked her sister.She looked at her sister, who was becoming more and more charming.Today Yaoniang wore a pink fold-peony robe with skirts in pink, combing the oblique bun, which was inserted with a hairpin of gold and inlaid red treasure butterfly love flowers.The hairpin was extremely delicate. When she didn\u2019t move, several little butterflies hanging down and it can see the slightly trembling butterfly wings as if alive. The mouth of the butterfly was inlaid with ruby. The size of ruby was not large, but the color was extremely charming, which made people feel trembling.The younger sister stretched out the white hand from time to time to touch the hairpin. The rich gold color was with red tones, snow-skinned hair and red lips, what a beauty picture was!Huiniang was not a man, otherwise she would be very crazy for her.Then she looked at the arrangement and furnishings in this house, and Huiniang knew that her sister was living the best life today. Most probably she was respected by people in the mansion, otherwise they would not come here today.But Huiniang knew that her sister was different from everyone else. She was married once before she stayed with Wangye. Although Wangye didn\u2019t show concern at this time, who knew if he would care in the future, or if he knew something and felt unhappy in his heart, and maybe her sister wouldn\u2019t be cared much by Wangye in the future. Then that\u2019s really not good.Yaoniang didn\u2019t consider so much, and she just missed Xiaobao too much.She couldn\u2019t leave the mansion, so she could only let Xiaobao come here. For this matter, she started making arrangements many days in advance. Although she was doted by Wangye, she didn\u2019t have any real power in the mansion. All she had to obey to the royal consort. In order to allow the royal consort to agree to see her son, she tried her best to stay with Jin Wang when he returned mansion from the border town and said some bad things to make Hu Side Consort embarrassed in Si Yi Courtyard. So the imperial consort agreed to let her see Xiaobao.At this time, listening to her sister\u2019s words, Yaoniang could not help but felt a little bit worried.But she also thought that her sister would be frightened if she was doted by Wangye. It would be better if cold faced Jin Wang was far away from her. Lest she would be jeopardized for fearing that it might interfere with the consort, and the consort would oppose her.In fact, there was another thing that Yaoniang was too embarrassed to think about it more. That was, Jin Wang was too strong. Maybe because he stayed in the border town for a long time, and he got extra greedy on sex. As soon as he returned to the mansion, he would stay with her from day to night. It was said she was doted much by Wangye because of this.In fact, Jin Wang did not say anything to her except to have sex.Yaoniang was originally from a humble family. Her dad was a scholar, and she also knew a few words. She knew a lot more than ordinary women. Knowing Jin Wang\u2019s actions was actually treating her as a toy, but she lived in Jin Wang Mansion, she had to listen to him. She hadn\u2019t had rights to decide anything since she entered Jin Wang Mansion.However, she would never tell her sister about this for fearing of causing her worry, she could only smile to her sister and said that she didn\u2019t care.Did she really not care?Huiniang didn\u2019t say it, but she was anxious. She always felt that her sister hadn\u2019t changed her previous innocence.Huiniang was thinking wildly, while Yaoniang was holding up Xiaobao and teasing him.The little baby who was more than one year old was very interesting. He spoke in a cute way and listening to his tones was enough to make people\u2019s hearts melt.At this time, Die\u2019er came in from outside and said that the consort wanted to talked with Yaoniang and also took Xiaobao with her.The sisters looked at each other, and Yaoniang pressed the uneasiness in her heart. She hugged Xiaobao and pulled up her sister then went out of the door. On the way to appease Huiniang who was uneasy, and she told her sister that the consort was a kind person.Royal consort was indeed a kind person. Although she looked a little colder, she treated Xiaobao and Huiniang very differently.She not only gave a gold bracelet to Huiniang, but also a small gold-studded collar to Xiaobao. In order to show her respect to Yaoniang, the consort also personally put a gold collar on Xiaobao.Since then, Yaoniang was not anxious anymore. But she had became totally grateful.She thought a lot. She thought that as the consort liked Xiaobao, would it be easier for her to see her son in the future? Of course, there was definitely a price to pay, for which she even thought of waiting for Jin Wang to return from the border town, and what methods she should use to let him stay in her room.She remembered that he liked to have sex in the study room very much. She always refused because of shyness, which had attracted his dissatisfaction. So he didn\u2019t see her for many days and the consort treated her very indifferently in those days. Until Jin Wang came to see her again, the consort treated her a little better.Otherwise, try in this way?The consort did not stay with Yaoniang for a long time, and said sisters need to talk together and let them go back then.At noon, the consort rewarded the dishes. The sisters and Xiaobao had lunch happily.It was still early. Yaoniang asked Die\u2019er to go out, and they sat on the bed next by the window and talked with each other, while coaxing Xiaobao to sleep.Xiaobao leaned into his mother\u2019s arms and slept exceptionally sweet.\u201cYou told me you will become a wet nurse after coming Jin Wang Mansion. Why do you serve Wangye now? Does Wangye treat you well or not?\u201d It was also the kindness of consort that made Huiniang erase the anxiety in her heart, so she dared to say these private words to her sister.At first, Yaoniang thought about how to explain to her sister, and then she heard the phrase \u201ctreat well or not\u201d, then she blushed.What is \u201ctreat well or not\u201d? For outsiders it\u2019s good to be doted. So he treated her well?When she saw her younger sister\u2019s reaction, what else did she not understand? She sighed and said, \u201cSince Wangye treats you well, you will serve him with all your heart, and you won\u2019t be afraid of being abandoned in the future. You don\u2019t need to worry about Xiaobao. Your brother-in-law and I will look after him. And we will treat him very well.\u201dUpon hearing this, Yaoniang couldn\u2019t help but glanced at Xiaobao in her arms, and touched his little head.\u201cSister\u2026\u201d\u201cYou are finally have something to look forward, and I don\u2019t have to worry about you all the time. You have to be smart. You should fight properly\u2026 The consort treats you well and you should be obedient to her. She is the consort, and you are just a concubine. You should never have that mind that\u2026 \u201cIn fact, Huiniang didn\u2019t understand the way of life in the mansion. She could only try to tell her sister some truth that she knew, and Yaoniang listened carefully and nodded her head.And time passed imperceptibly.Die\u2019er came in from the outside and said, \u201cMadam, it\u2019s getting late.\u201dYaoniang immediately felt a tear-like pain in her heart, and wanted to hold her sister and Xiaobao from letting them go, but she forced to smile. She stood up to pick up things in the bedroom. Since she entered the room, she secretly wiped her tears for a while and wiping her face before coming out with a bag.There were clothes she made for Xiaobao in the past few months inside the bag. All were good materials that the consort gave her. There were also clothes she made for her sister and brother-in-law and some taels that she collected a few months which were regarded as the food money that would be fostered Xiaobao at her sister\u2019s house.She reluctantly sent Huiniang and Xiaobao to the back door. Xiaobao was awake now, and looked at the adults with some confusion. Huiniang sighed and comforted her sister that not to be sad. And in the future if there was another opportunity, she would take Xiaobao to visit her again.Yao cheng was already waiting in the carriage, and Huiniang held Xiaobao to get on it.Yaoniang didn\u2019t dare to look at them. She turned her head and bit her lower lip with her head down. She determined to please consort, and she would let Xiaobao and her sister to the mansion in the future.When she thought about it that way, the feeling of discomfort in her heart was lightened, and she returned to the courtyard with Die\u2019er.For today, she had been busy for many days. After Jin Wang left each time, she had to rest for many days. In order to meet Xiaobao for the past two days, she couldn\u2019t even take a rest. At this moment they were gone, and she calmed down and felt very tired.\u201cDie\u2019er, don\u2019t call me for dinner. I want to sleep for a while.\u201d She told Die\u2019er while entering the bedroom.Die\u2019er followed her and she was jealous to look at her back swaying in the wind. She scolded \u201cfox bitch\u201d in her heart.Everyone in Jin Wang Mansion knew that Yaoniang seduced Jin Wang. She shamelessly pulled Wangye to her room. Die\u2019er served her and she had seen some unseen scenes. Thinking about that day she saw a beautiful shadow lying on Jin Wang, she could not help but blushed. At the same time, she scolded in her heart again.She pursed her lips and followed up to serve Yaoniang to change clothes, but there was a harsh scream after she entering the door.Yaoniang was lying prone on the ground without any sound, and dark blood dripped from the corner of her mouth.Notes: This is one new book I decided to translate.

    "Chapter 2": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Jin Wang Dotes on His ConcubineCH 2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayYaoniang held Xiaobao\u2019s hands tightly. Only in this way could she truly feel that she was alive.Outside, Su Huiniang was talking to her mother-in-law Li.The two probably thought that Yaoniang was asleep. Although their voices were low, they had no worries. The quarrel of the two entered the gap along the door and got into Yaoniang\u2019s heart.Yaoniang smiled bitterly.She died too quickly and hurriedly, and only felt the burning pain of internal organs in her body. She became unconscious when she woke up again. It was not long after she gave birth to Xiaobao.When she just woke up, she thought that she was dreaming. She finally woke up and thought it\u2019s not dreams until everything happened one after another. She wasn\u2019t dreaming, but she had really returned to the original life.Why God just didn\u2019t let her go? why didn\u2019t let her live again before everything had happened? But at this time!The baby in her arms moved a bit, interrupting Yaoniang\u2019s thoughts. She gently touched him twice, and Xiaobao slept again.The two-month-old baby was just the time to be growing up. His facial features became clearer, and he had a good-looking look. The long eye contours, long eyelashes, tall nose bridges and pink lips really made people like very much.If an uninformed person saw this child, he would admire him that the child\u2019s father must be very handsome.But the kid\u2019s father\u2014\u2014Probably she died once and lived again, Yaoniang was not as worried about it as in her last life.If she reborn to the time before everything happened, there would not be Xiaobao here?She was a mother of two lives. Although this child was not blessed and even caused her many ordeals, Yaoniang still loved him so much. She was pregnant nearly ten months and gave birth to the kid regardless her fame and life. How could she give him up?So she was destined to give birth to Xiaobao, and it was destined to happen all those unbearable things.All were destined!When she thought about this, Yaoniang\u2019s anxious heart finally calmed down.As a result, when she heard the words of humiliation towards her outside again, she was not as angry as she thought.Outside Huiniang looked at Li unbelievably, and could not accept that such vicious words came out of her mouth.For her mother-in-law, she already knew that she was not a good person. Anyone could say these things, but she was not qualified.The reason why Yaoyao suffered all this and why she was pregnant before marriage was because of her good daughter, her younger sister-in-law. Her good-looking sister just came to accompany her for a few days and suffered such an uncomfortable thing.Her reputation and integrity were gone, and the most important innocence of a girl was gone.Their dad was either sighing in sorrow or furious, and mother washed her face with tears all day. They wanted to find a good person to marry her sister, as long as they didn\u2019t dislike her because she lost her innocence. However, her sister was pregnant.She was also neglected by family. And elder sister-in-law made troubles all day. Yaoyao suffered this distress and was so distraught that when she discovered that she was pregnant. The fetus was too big and could not be aborted.Unless she didn\u2019t care about her lives.She couldn\u2019t stay at home. Coincidentally, she was pregnant and took her sister aside. She could protect her sister. After her sister gave birth to the child, then she would send the child out and hide this incident.She planed everything well, but just ignored a mother\u2019s heart. Her sister was so reluctant to send Xiaobao away.They were mothers of children, and Huiniang understood her sister.She was pregnant nearly ten months and had walked into the gate of the hell and gave birth to the kid. Every day she took her kid in her arms and looked at him all the time, and how could she bear to sent the kid to others.At the beginning, her mother-in-law treated her well because of a guilty conscience. If there was some nutritious food in the house, there would be a portion for her and a portion for Yaoyao, too. But it was only within half a year that her mother-in-law changed, and she always said some bad things in front of her.Because her younger sister and nephew were living in the mother-in-law\u2019s house, everything was bearable. But she never imagined that her mother-in-law was becoming more and more bad. Even when she and Yaoyao were negligent, her mother-in-law almost took Xiaobao out to send to others. Had it not been for her husband\u2019s return in time to stop all this, Huiniang could hardly imagine what would happen next.Yaoyao cared and loved Xiaobao so much. If he died, could her sister live?Therefore Huiniang was extremely angry, and she had never quarreled to mother-in-law before, but now she quarreled with Li .\u201cWhy am I doing this wrong? She\u2019s an innocent girl before. How could such a shame thing happened if she loves herself! I haven\u2019t seen any girl looked like her. Her chest bulged and the butt is round and big. As soon as she walks and she shakes, no man can stand her. I\u2019ve lived so long and never seen such a girl. It must because that she had sex affairs privately and made such troubles. So now she takes Yan Er as a shield!\u201dLi had a long face and single eyelid. Because she was old and thin with slack skin, when her old skin was pulled down, she looked very mean.This was indeed the case. Everyone knew in the whole alley that there was a mean mother-in-law who managed his man to be convincing in Yao family. The man was dead and she managed the house. The son and daughter-in-law did not dare to say anything in front of her.This old lady was also vixenish. If someone dared to say some bad things to her, she dared to stand in front of others and scolded for three days. Especially there was a son from Yao family worked as a catcher and no one dared to mess with her. They all didn\u2019t want to see her. Over time, it was obvious that people lived in the same alley, but no one wanted to go to Yao family.\u201cI\u2019ll tell you again, Su Huiniang. Don\u2019t come here to talk with Yan Er. It\u2019s nothing to do with Yan Er. Yan Er is a girl, and she is impossible to cheat your sister to go to the brothel. Yan Er will marry someone in the future. time if I hear this kind of words again, I will let Cheng Er divorce with you!\u201d Li scolded and put her hands on the waist.Huiniang was furious at her mother-in-law\u2019s shamelessness, and stood up suddenly: \u201cIt is no need that you let your son divorce me. I\u2019ll go by myself!\u201dLi sneered and said: \u201cHurry up. Don\u2019t take Hong\u2019er out. It\u2019s not possible that your poor father can take after a whole family, let alone his two daughters who against the doctrines of women and the two bastards of unknown origin!\u201dHuiniang shivered with anger, but she could not do anything to scold since she was very polite when she was young. Not to mention that the woman was her mother-in-law, her husband\u2019s mother.She wiped her tears and went back to pack all the things. She planned to take her younger sister, Xiaobao and Hong\u2019er back to her family. If her husband asked her go back again this time, she would never come back. She didn\u2019t believe she couldn\u2019t survive in this world with her sister.At this moment, a loud male voice suddenly sounded outside the door.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Mother, what have you done?\u201dYao Cheng, the man of Huiniang\u2019s husband, was back.Yao Cheng was a catcher in Lin Yun county, under the jurisdiction of Jin Zhou. The Lin family had been an official for generations. This catcher position was passed to him by her father. Although his status was lower, he worked for royal family and always had a lot of gray income. Therefore, the family life of Yao family was pretty good. Otherwise, scholar Xiu would not allow his elder daughter to marry Yao family.Although there was a scholar in Su family, but family life was not good. scholar Su was teaching in a private school. He only got two silvers in a month but he had to raise dozens of people in the family. There were a few people in family before and they lived in a tighter life. But since Su Huiniang\u2019s brother Su Yucheng married and had three children in a row, Su family was lived in straitened circumstances.The reason why Su Huiniang married the Yao family at that time was that the dowries offered by Yao family were the most among all the relatives. And it could just hold a wedding ceremony for Su Yucheng by using these betrothal gift. Su Huiniang was unwilling to marry Yao\u2019s family, but she couldn\u2019t want to make her father and mother upset. The elder brother was far beyond the age of marriage but he still didn\u2019t get married. Also she saw Yao Cheng once and thought the man was pretty good, so she married with him.After they married, Yao Cheng loved his wife and cared about her. The young couple loved each other and lived happily. The only imperfect thing was that Yao Cheng\u2019s mother Li was not easy to get along with.However, Yao Cheng stood in front of everything, and Su Huiniang lived well. Also she was pregnant. She gave birth to the grandson for Yao family on the year she married. She was pregnant again last year and gave birth to Hong Er. Her position in Yao family had become more and more stable.Li occasionally wanted to make troubles, and when she thought of her son and grandson, she would bear herself and not making troubles.Since her sister-in-law married in Su family, she always had some bad thoughts on Su Yaoniang. After two consecutive incidents, she became more and more ridiculous. Huiniang cared much about her sister and thought that her family was not affluent, so she took her sister around her aside.The excuse was to ask her sister to help her with nephew. Anyway, with the family living standards of Yao, it\u2019s acceptable to let her sister live together.In this regard, Li agreed happily.She had always been lazy and spoiled her daughter, thinking that someone would help her daughter-in-law to do some works. Since Yao Cheng became the head of the catcher, Li became very arrogant. But she was still too mean that she didn\u2019t want to buy a servant. Now there would be a free servant. That was really what she wanted.When Yaoniang came to Yao family, she was diligent and could help both inside and outside. She really shared a lot of housework with Huiniang.It stood to reason that this was a good thing that had the best of both worlds, but Yan\u2019er did some bad things.Yan\u2019er was the youngest daughter of Li. She had always been doted. The 14-year-old girl did not work all day long, and her temper was very arbitrary. Yao Cheng became the leader of catchers, and some of his subordinates came to find him at home because of business affairs. Among them, there was a catcher named Chen An was very handsome and talented. If someone did not know he was a catcher, they may think that he was a scholar.Chen An came here only twice, and Yan\u2019er secretly fell in love with him.But she never thought that he didn\u2019t like her. The reason why Chen An would come to Yao family regularly was because she saw Yaoniang at Yao family and fell in loved with Yaoniang. So he always come to Yao family.And this matter was somehow known to Yan\u2019er.Yan\u2019er was very vicious. She had been in contact with catching things since she was a child. She knew many things in the world. And she had a plan that she deceived Yaoniang to go to the brothel, where a good girl would not get involved and she wanted to take the opportunity to spoil Yaoniang\u2019s reputation.This tragedy happened, and Yaoniang was raped by an unknown strongman. Everything happened after that.And the reason why Yao family knew what was going on was because Yao Cheng forced Yan\u2019er to tell the truth and she said it herself after this bad thing happened from Yaoniang.However she insisted that she was only teasing Yaoniang, but not trying to harm her.But who would believe her?Her mother Li would protect Yan\u2019er, but Yan\u2019er was only scolded several times. Even if Huiniang was so angry, but she couldn\u2019t do anything to her sister-in-law. So she went back to her own family. But Yao Cheng repeatedly asked her to go home with him, thinking Ming Er who was crying to find her mother, so she went back angrily.Because of feeling guilty for her sister, and her elder sister-in-law always made troubles at home, she insisted on bringing Yaoniang to her side. But no places were clean and quiet. Her sister couldn\u2019t stay at Su family and Yao family was not a good place either.Originally, Li was still suffering from a guilty conscience and agreed secretly to allow Yaoniang to live here. But she didn\u2019t know what Yan\u2019er had been provoking in it. She became more and more intolerant of Yaoniang. She always said that such a person at home had broken the reputation of Yao family.The question was: was there still reputation for Yao family?Yaoniang was in the room. She was listening to the quarrel outside and thought without any facial expressions.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He shouted at Li and let Li go out.But the problem still existed.Li would continue to make troubles only if Yan\u2019er, Yaoniang and Li were still at home.Huiniang was crying on the bed for her grievance, her mean mother-in-law and poor sister.Yao Cheng stood aside helplessly. He felt distressed at his wife and pitiful for his sister-in-law, but he couldn\u2019t take his mother and sister out. He was the only son in Yao family. Before his dad died, he repeatedly asked him to take care of his mother and her younger sister until she married.\u201cHuiniang, you beat me. Hit me hard. Don\u2019t be so angry with yourself. It\u2019s all my fault. It\u2019s all my fault\u2026\u201dA big man crouched there, holding his head and sighing. He was also a majestic catcher outside, but now he was such kind of man. Seriously speaking, Yao Cheng always treated Huiniang well, otherwise his wife would not be able to live with him too long.\u201cYour mother has lost her conscience, and your sister is also vicious. How can they do this to\u2026\u201d Huiniang cried sadly.Her sister was obedient from a young age. She called her elder sister behind when she was a little girl. When she grew up, she always took some delicious food to let sister eat first. In order to embroider a hijab for her sister, she secretly made purses nearly two months at home for changing a piece of good silk.Obviously, the elder sister-in-law always made troubles to her secretly. But she didn\u2019t say anything in family. If she didn\u2019t go back to her own home, She wouldn\u2019t know that her elder sister-in-law would sell her sister out, hearing from the neighbor aunt Man.\u201cHuiniang, it\u2019s all my fault. It\u2019s all my fault. Don\u2019t cry\u2026\u201dOutside the room, Huiniang was crying.In the room, Yaoniang burst into tears.Yao Cheng comforted Huiniang for a while, then she calmed down.He diligently went to fetch water to wash Huiniang\u2019s face and combed her hair again. In addition to her eyes were very red and swollen, her emotions had calmed down quite a bit. But she was also frowned. Obviously she was still worried about Yaoniang.Yao Cheng sighed and went outside.It wasn\u2019t too early in the day. But nobody cooked the dinner. He never felt it before he got married. After getting married, there was a gentle and virtuous wife who prepared meals for him every day. Yao Cheng felt that this situation was extremely intolerable.He was very annoyed when he thought what happened just now.Li was his mother. No matter how annoying he could be, he couldn\u2019t be angry to his mother, but Yan\u2019er\u2026Yao Cheng remembered that when he just entered the gate of the courtyard he saw the curtain of the west chamber moved.His sister was young but had a vicious mind. Why did he have a such sister?He came to the west chamber a few steps and patted the window, \u201cYou come out and cook!\u201dIt was very quiet in the room. After a while, Yan\u2019er walked out from the room slowly.\u201cBrother, sister-in-law is not busy and she can cook.\u201dYao Cheng sneered: \u201cYour sister-in-law is taking after Ming\u2019er, Hong\u2019er. What\u2019s more, you are their aunt, you must cook the dinner. And your sister-in-law shouldn\u2019t cook dinner for you!\u201dYan\u2019er became unhappy and said: \u201cYaoniang is here\u2026\u201dYao Cheng yelled, \u201cShut up! I ask you to cook, you must do it right now!\u201dSeeing his elder brother getting so angry, Yan\u2019er didn\u2019t dare to speak anymore and honestly went to the kitchen to cook.Li was so angry and bit the window side of the upper room. The words of her son said to her daughter were actually he wanted to tell her.It\u2019s no use to be angry. Yao Cheng had always been filial, but he was really annoyed and Li dare not provoke him.Yan\u2019er was dealing with vegetables in her hand, which were spoiled by her. Seeing Yao Cheng enter the house, Li secretly came to the kitchen. As soon as she entered the door, she saw his daughter dealing with vegetables.\u201cYour brother was right to scold you. You are a mature girl now but you still don\u2019t know how to deal with the vegetables. What else you can do?\u201d Li scolded, and came over to drive her aside.Yan\u2019er threw away the rotten leaves in her hand, and said aggrievedly \u201cMom, you know that my brother shouted at me just now. I think he shouldn\u2019t marry with Su Huiniang at first. Since she came into our home, my brother has changed a lot. He not only shouted at me but also shouted at you.\u201dLi was also angry, and his son now cared much about his wife. Everyone would be angry when he faced such situation. But she would not tell her daughter even if she was angry. Because it meant that she lost her dignity.\u201cThe daughters of Su family are all unkind. Brother should divorce with Su Huiniang and marry another woman. Anyway, we are rich family and we have money to let brother marry again. By that time, the new sister-in-law will be very filial and take good care of us. She will treat you better than Su Huiniang.\u201dLi gave her daughter a glance: \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have this kind of thought. Even if I don\u2019t like Su Huiniang, but I like my two grandchildren. If Yao Cheng marry with another woman, how about Ming\u2019er and Hong\u2019er? You girl need a stepmother to do some bad things to you because you always have some vicious thoughts.\u201dYan\u2019er pursed her lips: \u201cAll of the things you don\u2019t agree. When will you get Su Yaoniang away? How many meals should they eat when they are at our home? The most important thing is that brother Chen An won\u2019t marry me if Su Yaoniang is here?\u201dLi threw the vegetables in hand, then poked her head and scolded, \u201cYou always said Chen An. What made you so fascinated that you did the thing lack of morality? Listen to me. Don\u2019t always stay with that black boy. You are a girl and you shouldn\u2019t stay with those boys all day long unless you don\u2019t want to marry someone in the future?\u201dThose boys she said were all the children who lived in nearby streets and grew up with Yan\u2019er. Yan\u2019er was a clever and disobedient girl, and no one cared about her personality. She didn\u2019t like to play with girls of the same age, but she liked to play with the boys.\u201cMom, I won\u2019t play with them from now on. When will Su Yaoniang go away? When Chen An and I are ready to get married, I will stay at home to prepare and won\u2019t go anywhere.\u201d\u201cIt is so bad for a girl saying such words!\u201d Li scolded and immediately frowned: \u201cI want her to leave, but your sister-in-law and your brother\u2026\u201dShe said and paused, then said again, \u201cI\u2019ll go to Su family tomorrow.\u201dYan\u2019er slapped right now, and laughed: \u201cMom, you are really my good mom!\u201dYaoniang always felt that everything that happened in the last life was like a dream.She always had an unreal feeling until the sister-in-law Zhu came to Yao family like a dream.As soon as Zhu entered, she went straight to the cubicle.This small cubicle was separated from the big room outside. Yaoniang didn\u2019t live here before, but she lived in the west chamber with Yan\u2019er. Since that happened, Huiniang and Yao Cheng deliberately separated a room for Yaoniang from the room where they lived.The small cubicle was not as good as the outside, but it was not bad. There was a small cubicle window. There was a table under the window and a shelf bed next to the wall. A teal tent hung on the bed, with a cupboard and two boxes at the foot of the bed. Although it was a bit humble, it was very clean. Yaoniang was always hardworking and diligent.As Xiaobao fell asleep and she put him on the bed, she heard something moving behind her then she turned to see that Zhu came in. Yaoniang\u2019s face froze immediately.Every time Zhu saw her sister-in-law, and she had an urge to sigh.Seriously speaking, there was no such outstanding person in the Su family. Even Su Huiniang was just a delicate and pretty woman. But it seemed that Su Yaoniang had gathered the merits of everyone in the Su family. She was not like from Su family.A pair of luscious eyes and a pair of crescent moon eyebrows were indifferent. The straight nose bridges, gorgeous cherry lips, and white good skin made Zhu feel very jealous every time when she saw Yaoniang.Appearance was not the most important. The key was that romantic and charming figure. At first glance, it was not obvious. But when saw her carefully, it really made people impressed. So Zhu thought that Yaoniang deserved to be a concubine for the rich people otherwise it would be so pitiful.And Zhu came exactly for this matter.Thinking of the fifty silvers from Hu Laoye (master of Hu family), Zhu smiled brightly.Sister-in-law also knew that when she came up and would say such thing. And she must be annoyed. So she pretended to look at the sleeping little Xiaobao and praised the child for being so good, like her mother. Then she got to the side of Yaoniang.\u201cYao\u2019er, you are always a daughter in Su family. It is not so good if you always live in Yao family. Your father and mother miss you. How about going back home with me today?\u201dYaoniang hated this sister-in-law in her heart. But since Zhu entered the gate of Su\u2019s house and gave birth to three grandchildren to Su family, she had to respect her. Even if she hated her, she could not show out. After all, the elder sister-in-law was like a mother.This was the true thoughts of Yaoniang in her last life, so she tolerated Zhu\u2019s various bad behaviors. But in this life she was too lazy to pretend. Because she knew that no matter how obedient she was and how she begged her sister-in-law, her sister-in-law would never give up the idea of selling her for changing silver.In the home, Dad cared much about his reputation. Although her mother loved her so much, she didn\u2019t have real power. The elder brother always listened to his wife, so Zhu was almost in charge of the half affairs of Su family.No one could save her, so she could only save herself.She vaguely remembered that in the last life she heard Zhu\u2019s words and went home with her. Because she still wanted to maintain a peace with Zhu. But she almost hurt Xiaobao that he would be sent away. She was also sent to Hu Laoye to be a concubine.Fortunately, her elder sister and brother-in-law arrived in time to save her.Because of this matter, people around all knew that she had a kid before marriage. Hu Laoye hated her and said that Su family had a daughter who had lost her virtue and asked someone to take her to dip her in a pig cage. It was her sister who forced her brother-in-law to use the relationship in Yamen, and also lied that she was the servant of royal Mansion. So it would rescue her who almost was soaked in a pig cage.After that, Dad felt that she had lost Su family\u2019s reputation and did not want to admit she was his daughter again. The elder sister\u2019s mother-in-law also took the opportunity to have an attack. She had nowhere to settle and could only go to royal mansion to be a wet nurse. Then everything would happen after that.Since the God gave her a chance to live again, she couldn\u2019t let the old things happen again. At least she would not to be fooled by Zhu.\u201cElder sister-in-law, Yaoniang lost Su family\u2019s reputation and I don\u2019t want to go back.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the reputation? You\u2019re from Su family. Your parents, brother and I care about you so much. I was really anxious before I did some bad things to you. Because you suffered such a shame thing since you still was not married. What should you do in the future? I am still so anxious and uneasy. But things have already happened. We are families and we won\u2019t ignore you, right?\u201dZhu said very emotionally, but Yaoniang was cheated by her once. There wouldn\u2019t have the second time. No matter what she said, she just did not want to go back with her. She didn\u2019t want to be immersed in a pig cage again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 4": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Jin Wang Dotes on His ConcubineCH 4Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySeriously, Zhu was not a patient woman.The reason why she would talk well was only for the fifty silvers. It can be seen that the sister-in-law who had been so easy to cheat was unwilling to go back with herself no matter what she said, and she was immediately annoyed.\u201cLe me tell you. You have to go back no matter you want to go or not. Hu Laoye likes you and he wants you to be his eighth concubine. He doesn\u2019t care that you\u2019re not a virgin and still want to have you. That\u2019s all ancestors\u2019 contribution of Su family. You should go back with me honestly! \u201cThis was the true personality of Zhu. She was horrible and vulgar. Yaoniang didn\u2019t know why her parents choose Zhu as their daughter-in-law and let her marry elder brother. So that she made many troubles in Su family.\u201cDoes my father know?\u201dZhu was shocked immediately, then looked at her with a mock face: \u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to learn to threaten me? I\u2019m not afraid to tell you the truth. I came here with the consent of father. So? Do you really regard yourself as a golden Bodhisattva that the whole family have to focus on you every day? You can only marry Hu Laoye as his concubine now, otherwise you will be sent to the countryside to marry a farmer.\u201dYaoniang didn\u2019t think for the truth will be like this. She looked pale as if she had been split by thunder.She was shocked and felt painful in her heart. But she was clearer that why Zhu hit her and sent her to Hu family without any obstacles before. How could it be so smooth? After all, she was at her own home at that time.Later, her sister and brother-in-law found her and took her home. Her mother said that this was done by Zhu alone and other people in the family didn\u2019t know it. So she believed. At this moment, it was impossible for a woman Zhu that she could stun her and send her out without telling the families.It turned out that everyone in the family actually knew that maybe someone else had helped Zhu. So she was stupid and hated Zhu in two lives.Zhu proudly looked at sister-in-law\u2019s pale face and said, \u201cDon\u2019t delay. Just pack up and follow me.\u201d Then, she reached out her hands and pulled Yaoniang.Yaoniang threw away her hand: \u201cDon\u2019t pull me, I won\u2019t go back.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re so stubborn. Why do you think that I come here today? Why Huiniang is not at home today? Hurry up to follow me\u2026\u201dThe two pulled each other. Xiao Bao was awoken in bed and cried.No one came to see what happened for such a big movement. Yaoniang knew that Zhu did not lie to her. Li must ask her sister to leave.She felt so sad but she was nervous and angry. She touched a firm object with her fingers, grabbing it subconsciously and waved at Zhu, trying to push her back.Zhu only felt so painful, and saw her blood. Suddenly she called loudly like killing a pig.\u201cKilled, blood\u2026\u201d She rolled her eyes and fainted.Su Huiniang heard a horrible sound from her home. Her heart tightened, and she quickly sped up her pace.Her mother-in-law and she didn\u2019t talk for many days. She never thought that today her mother-in-law actually smiled at her, and took the money and told her to go to coffin shop in the east to buy some paper money, and said that the father-in-law\u2019s death day came, and she wanted to prepare something for worship.Su Huiniang was puzzled in her heart, so she didn\u2019t doubt it. She only thought that her mother-in-law was lazy and didn\u2019t want to go far. So her mother-in-law would please her and let her buy.When she walked halfway, she felt strange. There were coffin shops near the place they lived. Why did her mother-in-law deliberately ask her to go to the east of the city? Her mother-in-law said that she used to buy it there, which was cheaper than elsewhere. At that time, Huiniang didn\u2019t think too much. But when she walked on the road, she realized that her mother-in-law cared much about her reputation and would never please her for a few pennies.She went back in a hurry and did not expect that something really happened at home.When she entered the door, she saw a person lying on the floor, and her timid younger sister took a pair of scissors in her hand, and her mother-in-law said some murderous words.\u201cYaoyao.\u201dYaoniang threw the pair of scissors away and ran to her. \u201cSister, she stubbornly asked me to be a concubine for Hu Laoye\u2026\u201d\u201cSo you\u2026\u201dSu Huiniang\u2019s face was pale like a piece of paper, and her mind was all messy. Her sister killed someone.Li shouted aside: \u201cSu Huiniang, you have to send your sister to the Yamen. She even killed someone\u2026\u201dSu Huiniang was already messed up, and her mother-in-law was still making more troubles. She yelled, \u201cYou shut up!\u201d Then she pulled Yaoniang to the bed, \u201cClean up now, and quickly take Xiao Bao away. I will ask your brother-in-law to take you go to the countryside. You have to hide for some days first\u2026 \u201cYaoniang wanted to cry and laugh, and couldn\u2019t help pulling her elder sister, \u201cElder sister, I didn\u2019t kill\u2026\u201d\u201cYou must be hard in the countryside, but it was better than going to jail\u2026\u201d Su Huiniang suddenly responded and asked, \u201cWhat did you say? You didn\u2019t kill anyone, then she\u2026\u201d\u201cI just took out a pair of scissors and showed to her. But she seemed to have blood phobia\u2026\u201dYaoniang never thought that Zhu had blood phobia. No wonder she never killed chickens or fishes at home. She always ask other people to kill.Su Huiniang came to Zhu\u2019s side. She reached out her hand and put in front of her nose, then she touched her chest, and was finally assured that she didn\u2019t die. Huiniang breathed a sigh of relief, remembering what her younger sister had just said, and suddenly felt annoyed. She took the tea on the table and then poured it on Zhu\u2019s face.\u201cZhu, you want to send Yaoyao to be a concubine. Let me tell you, as long as I am here one day, you shouldn\u2019t have this kind of ideas!\u201dZhu thought she was dead, but she never expected to live again. At this moment, she also knew that she had suffered blood phobia. She was extremely angry, and was about to yell something. Suddenly she saw Yaoniang waving scissors to her, and she was frightened out of the house.\u201cSu Yaoniang, I will let your father and your elder brother come to take you away, and you just wait for me!\u201dAfter Zhu spoke such harsh word and then left.Li saw that Zhu left with angry and she didn\u2019t dare to stay any longer and went back to the house. The two sisters cleaned up the room and coaxed Xiaobao to sleep before they sat down and talked.The younger sister said what happened just now and Su Huiniang was quite upset: \u201cIt\u2019s not too late for you to understand. What did our family to me at the beginning? If it weren\u2019t for me and your brother-in-law falling in love with each other at first, I might not know what kind of life I spend now. In the eyes of father and mother, only the big brother is the most important. Now there are Zhu and Dong. They don\u2019t care about us anyway. In fact this is nothing as long as you think positively.\u201dHong\u2019er cried on the main room. Su Huiniang said these words and hurriedly went over, leaving Yaoniang sitting alone in the room, thinking silently.Even though she rejected Zhu\u2019s plans but this matter was not over. She couldn\u2019t stay too long in Yao family. The people from Su family might be able to Yao family anytime. Did it mean that she would go to Jin Wang Mansion to work as a wet nurse as she did in her last life?As soon as she thought of the unknown death of her last life, Yaoniang was full of resistance.She really didn\u2019t want to go to Jin Wang Mansion again, but where should she go?Suddenly, she heard quarrels from elder sister and Li.Elder sister was not that kind of person before. She was very gentle and virtuous, but now she changed a lot. No matter how bad Li was, but she was still her brother-in-law\u2019s mother. Her brother-in-law was not possible to give up on her mother for elder sister. But as long as she was still in the house for one day, her sister will not be able to have a good day.She couldn\u2019t take care of herself selfishly, but mess up her sister\u2019s life.Yao Cheng stepped into the house, facing the quarrel between his wife and his mother, and his heart was full of exhaustion.He thought about what was in his heart, but he patiently persuaded the two to pull them away, and then dragged his wife into the room.\u201cHuiniang, Do you still remember aunt Wang, the mother of Da Niu, who delivered babies for you and Yaoniang?\u201d Yao Cheng suddenly said.Huiniang did not know why he mentioned this, and looked at him with a doubt.\u201cAunt Wang\u2019s sister is on duty at Jin Wang Mansion. She came back a few days ago and said that she needs a wet nurse in Jin Wang Mansion. Aunt Wang paid much attention and said to her elder sister about Yaoniang. But she said it is only decided when they see Yaoniang.\u201dHuiniang was so quiet when she listened but suddenly she became very angry.\u201cYao Cheng, are you trying to take my sister away?\u201dYao Cheng smiled bitterly: \u201cMy god, how dare I have this kind of thinking. But I thought, Yaoniang doesn\u2019t want to marry again, and she also has Xiaobao. Our family can support them for a year or two, but we can\u2019t support them for a lifetime. You know my mother\u2019s personality. She always makes troubles. Not to mention that now. Yaoniang is not comfortable staying at our home. It\u2019s better for her to change the environment and she can earn by herself. Even if she doesn\u2019t marry anymore, she can save money for a few years. And she can buy a house for Xiaobao and raise him up. Then find a wife for Xiaobao in the future.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201dYao Cheng spoke softly and carefully analyzed the pros and cons of it: \u201cJin Wang Mansion is a wealthy place. It is decent to work inside and the salaries are high. Don\u2019t you know what\u2019s your own family\u2019s situation now? You know what did your sister-in-law do today. It is estimated that your father and mother will come here in two days. If they really come on that day, we have no rights to stop them. Instead, it would be better for younger sister to go Jin Wang Mansion. It is also a way out.\u201dHuiniang did not speak. Apparently she agreed with what he said.At this moment, the door inside was suddenly opened and Yaoniang came out. Her delicate face was full of firmness, \u201cBrother-in-law, I\u2019m willing to go.\u201d Obviously she listened to their conversations for a long time.Huiniang stood up and said anxiously: \u201cYaoyao!\u201dYaoniang was forced to laugh and said: \u201cSister, I am willing to go. My brother-in-law is right. In stead of being sent to the landlord Hu to be a concubine, I would rather work in Jin Wang Mansion.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to marry anymore. I just want to raise Xiaobao and live with him in the future. Now that there is such a good opportunity to earn money. I will go to work as a wet nurse for few years. After I earn a lot of money, I can come out to do a small business by myself. I won\u2019t raise Xiaobao relying on others.\u201dAfter she finished speaking and she looked at Yao Cheng lightly: \u201cBrother-in-law, there should be a lot of wages in Jin Wang Mansion. If not, I won\u2019t go.\u201dYao Cheng said immediately: \u201cI had inquired from aunt Wang. The salary is very high. Ten silvers a month and it doesn\u2019t include a reward.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s quite a lot. Ten silvers a month, one year is one hundred and twenty. The wet nurse is not a long-term job. But as long as I can do it for a year, then I can earn enough silvers to buy a small yard and I can do my own small business to make a living.\u201dYaoniang murmured to herself. She got more excited when she thought about these things. She excitedly came forward and took Huiniang\u2019s hands, \u201cSister, there is such a good thing. It is really a rare chance.\u201dHuiniang had to agree because her sister agreed and was very happy.In fact judging from the current situation, this was indeed the best choice. She didn\u2019t have to live in Yao family and cared much about people here and didn\u2019t have to worry about being sold to someone by her elder brother and sister-in-law. Also, she could earn a lot of money.Except for Xiaobao.If Yaoniang was going to be a wet nurse for others, how about Xiaobao?Obviously under the pressure of reality, some things had to be given up. Fortunately, there were no long time intervals that Huiniang and Yaoniang both gave birth to babies. Huiniang had enough breast milk and she can help to take care of Xiaobao. So she wouldn\u2019t worry about that Xiaobao having no breast milk to drink.Now she made a decision and would go to aunt Wang\u2019s home to meet the person. Even she agreed but it would be no use if they don\u2019t choose her.But Yaoniang knew that she would be chosen to work in Jin Wang Mansion.Because she went there in her last life.Notes: If you like this novel, maybe you can rate and talk about it on NU.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 5": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Jin Wang Dotes on His ConcubineCH 5Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayBecause Yao Cheng had to go work in Yemen the next day, he brought Yaoniang to aunt Wang\u2019s home in the third day.He was afraid that it would not be possible for his sister-in-law working in Jin Wang Mansion. Yao Cheng specially prepared four kinds of pastries to take to the Wang family in order to let aunt Wang could say some goods words for them.These four kinds of pastries were all fashionable goods in Taoyuan Shop, and the price was not cheap. Anyway, based on the living standards of Yao family, they had never bought such expensive pastries to eat. Yao Cheng prepared much for her sister-in-law to find a good place to work.Early in the morning, Yao Cheng rushed to a mule cart that he had specifically borrowed, and took Yaoniang to Wang family.Wang family was in the willow alley, and a little far from Yao family. Yao Cheng knew that Yaoniang had to take care of Xiao Bao and she woke up many times at night. So he let her sleep a while and would call her when they arrived.Yaoniang closed her eyes obediently, but at this moment she couldn\u2019t fall asleep. She thought of some things that happened in Jin Wang Mansion in her last life.Wang family was also the generational officer. Father Wang was injured when he was a catcher in his early years. Therefore, when his son Da Niu became an adult, he gave up his position and passed to his son. The Wang family had a son who was a catcher, and aunt Wang had a good skill to help others deliver babies. So their life was very good.The half-timbered house, the large tiled house with blue bricks and black tiles, was cleaned up in front of the door. At a glance, the hostess of the family was diligent.As soon as they entered the gate of Wang family, there was a horse cart parking in the yard.The horse cart was a rare thing for ordinary people. Even if ordinary people bought vehicles at home, they also bought donkey and mule carts. The horses were very expensive. It would spend a dozens of silvers to buy a horse and good horse grain. Most people could afford to buy it but couldn\u2019t afford to keep the horse.Just looking at this horse cart, it was known that aunt Wang\u2019s sister must be decent in Jin Wang Mansion.But Yaoniang knew that Madam Liu was actually an inconspicuous woman in Jin Wang Mansion.Because she was immersed in self-sorrow and self-grief in her life, Yaoniang couldn\u2019t remember why Madam Liu choose her when she came to Wang family at first. Because of her different mentality this time, she had the mood to observe the situation around her.Her brother-in-law Yao Cheng went t into the house first and she was waiting and standing in the yard.Inexplicably, there was a feeling that someone was watching her.Madam Liu didn\u2019t actually put what her sister aunt Wang said in mind.She thought that there was no good person in this poor and remote Linyun County. The wet nurse who she wanted to find was not a special person. But she couldn\u2019t tell the truth to her sister. When she saw that her sister was so motivated to speak for the other party, she wanted to just look at the person and find an excuse to reject.So when Yao Cheng came in and talked to aunt Wang, she didn\u2019t even look at him.Until she saw the girl standing in the yard\u2026She seemed not like a young girl. But she still dressed as a girl.Madam Liu was an experienced person and naturally knew the difference between a girl and a woman. No matter how beautiful a girl was, she was implicit and restrained. The shoulders were closed. The eyebrows were unopened. The waist was thin but stiff, and the hips were tightened inward. The two legs were timidly joined together and tightly stitched together.Even the breasts were like the jade shoots just coming out. They were like flowers and not blooming flowers.But the girl in front of her looked like a juicy peach. The little white face was also slightly immature and coquettish, but it also exuded a casual charm.How to describe that feeling? It\u2019s as if it can pour a lot of sweet juice with just one poke.Stunner!Madam Liu thought for a long time before coming up with such an adjective.She couldn\u2019t listen to her sister and others, thinking about what she had heard and asked quickly: \u201cDoes the lady standing in the yard want to work in Jin Wang Mansion? Let her come in and have a look.\u201dYao Cheng was shocked and went out.Seeing the girl slowly approaching herself, Madam Liu seemed to have got something precious and her eyes were full of obvious joy.Aunt Wang looked at her younger sister with doubts and wondered why she was so happy.Maybe she was satisfied with Yaoniang?After thinking about this, she was also very happy. The girl had a bitter life. She also hoped to find a way for her to live, otherwise she wouldn\u2019t say some good words of her to her sister.Yaoniang felt very uneasy. Why Madam Liu looked at her as if she saw gold.She remembered that she didn\u2019t have such feeling in her last life, but she didn\u2019t have time to think about it. Because Madam Liu had already held her hand and ask.\u201cYou just born a baby? Why do you want to be a wet nurse? Are you willing to leave your man?\u201dYaoniang had talked with her elder sister and brother-in-law about all the things at home so it was not difficult to answer.\u201cHe died when I was pregnant. I really can\u2019t support myself now. So I just want to find a way to feed my child.\u201d She lowered her head and said quietly.When she heard that the man was dead, Madam Liu\u2019s eyes were even brighter. But no one noticed it.\u201cYou\u2019re a pitiful girl. It\u2019s different from other places when working in Jin Wang Mansion. The rules are strict and it\u2019s not like at home.\u201d\u201cI understand. I will abide by the rules of Jin Wang Mansion and will not make troubles.\u201dMadam Liu took her hands and looked at her little white face that like a egg peeled the shell. It\u2019s pretty and smooth. Madam Liu had seen the girl who was more beautiful than Yaoniang\uff0eBut when she saw this little lady at first glance, she knew that Yaoniang was the person she was looking for.She had an inexplicable feeling.She felt more and more satisfied, and she inevitably said more: \u201cBut the salaries in our mansion is sufficient. If you can be chosen, not to mention other benefits, you will have ten silvers in a month. Of course, if the masters are happy, the reward that they gave can compare with salaries that you work for a year and a half.\u201dAfter a pause, she said again, \u201cMaybe you don\u2019t know. This time, the wet nurse will take care of the little princess. If you do well and the princess likes you, then you have a chance to stay as a Mammy. At that time, you will be decent. It is not too much to say that you have some rights. When the day the princess grows up and marries, you\u2019ll go with her with respect and reputation. It is really your good luck.\u201dMadam Liu was extremely attentive and seemed to want Yaoniang to agree. Madam Liu did not say these words to Yaoniang in her last life. Yaoniang was a little strange about her intentions.Maybe it was short of wet nurse in Jin Wang Mansion? So the snobbish Madam Liu would treat her in this kind of way.At the same time, she also thought about some experiences of her last life, and said subconsciously: \u201cIt was also a servant to be a Mammy. It\u2019s nothing to do with good fortune.\u201dThen she realized what she said just now. She was so nervous and afraid to annoy Madam Liu.But Madam Liu was not annoyed at her instead looking at her who like an immature child and said: \u201cWhat a silly girl! But it\u2019s true that you ordinary people don\u2019t understand rules of celebrities. Let me tell you that there is a difference between servants. As the saying goes, the identities for the servants of the prime minister are more noble than ordinary people. Not to mention princess\u2019s Mammy. That\u2019s different from an ordinary wet nurse, but it can be regarded as a mother who takes care of princess.\u201dSeeing everyone looking at herself, Madam Liu was very proud. Therefore she said very carefully: \u201cIf you take care of princess till she grows up, and she will be willing to listen to you. Not only you have the dignity in front of other servants, but also when you face other masters. You can rely on Jin Wang Mansion and you can go to the whole Jin Zhou. Take me for an example, If I encounter anything in Linyun County, and I can go to Yeman then tell them I am from Jin Wang Mansion, even the master of the county would care about me and my dignity.\u201dYaoniang laughed bitterly in her heart.She naturally understood this truth, but she knew that it\u2019s not easy to be a servant in Jin Wang Mansion.In her last life, she obviously went into Jin Wang Mansion to be a wet nurse. But because she was hurt by someone, she was almost driven out. The royal consort thought she was good and allow her to continue to stay in Jin Wang Mansion. Who ever thought the side consort Hu always made troubles on her, so she was forced to have sex with Jin Wang helplessly.And the misfortune of her last life started from having sex with Jin Wang. Although Yaoniang didn\u2019t know why she died in her last life and who harmed her in the end, she suspected someone in her heart. If anyone in the Jin Wang Mansion who hated her, it was probably side consort Hu.Thinking of bad actions of side consort Hu, Yaoniang shuddered and at the same time she was a little interested.But that was it, and she knew she had no other way to go.Of course, she could be cheeky and withstood Li\u2019s insults from time to time, and stayed at Yao family. However, it was precisely that Yaoniang\u2019s staying in Yao family was not a long-term thing. Her brother-in-law was right. The Yao family can support her and Xiao Bao for a year or two. Can they support them for a lifetime? Xiao Bao would grow up one day. Would she let her son live in such a humiliating environment?She also had to consider her elder sister. She couldn\u2019t just take care of herself, which ruined her sister\u2019s good life. So she only had one way to go.Madam Liu said something, but Yaoniang didn\u2019t listen to her because of her confused mood.All in all, she made a decision.Because Madam Liu had to go back quickly and she would leave the day after tomorrow, which meant that Yaoniang had only one day to stay with Xiaobao and she would go to Jin City later.Jin Cheng was not far from Linyun County, which was more than a day\u2019s journey. But it would not be so easy to come out after entering Jin Wang Mansion, which meant that she would not see Xiaobao for a long time.After returning, Yaoniang was not happy. She greeted to her sister, and went into the small compartment to see Xiaobao.Huiniang was shocked for a moment, thinking that she wasn\u2019t chosen to work in Jin Wang Mansion, and she was trying to get in to persuade her younger sister not to think too much. But she was pulled by her husband.\u201cIt\u2019s done, and she will go on the day after tomorrow. It is estimated that Yaoniang doesn\u2019t want to leave Xiaobao alone. Let her stay with the child for a while.\u201dHuiniang became sad and she sighed heavily.Xiaobao just woke up and was lying on the bed. He looked around.When he saw his mother appearing in front of his eyes, his eyes were different and he seemed to know that this is his mother.Yaoniang was sad and could not help but crying while holding Xiaobao.After crying for a while, she wiped her tears and untied her clothes to feed Xiaobao.Xiaobao hadn\u2019t eaten for a while. She was so greedy and sucked hard. Yaoniang looked at him with affection and stroked his little head that had just grown a layer of hair.The next day, Yaoniang held Xiaobao and didn\u2019t go anywhere. She used to do some housework at home, but she didn\u2019t do it now.Yao Cheng gave a lesson to Li the day before yesterday and she didn\u2019t make any troubles and kept a low profile these two days. Huiniang had to take care of Ming\u2019er and Hong\u2019er and didn\u2019t have time to do housework. Yaoniang didn\u2019t do, either. She was busy with housework these two days and very busy. Finally, she couldn\u2019t bear and scolded in the yard.Yao Cheng was not at home, and now Huiniang didn\u2019t want to bear her anymore. She lifted the curtain and stood at the door watching Li coldly.\u201cDon\u2019t scold. Yaoniang will leave tomorrow.\u201dThe author has something to say:Jin Wang: \u201cHuh\u2026 Am I dead?\u201dYaoniang: I really thought you were dead at that time\u2026Jin Wang: How about now?Yaoniang: You are alive, and you\u2019re still strong.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She looked at Huiniang for a long time, and felt that Huiniang didn\u2019t seem to lie to her. She couldn\u2019t help but became curious.\u201cWhere is she going to go?\u201dWhen Huiniang saw Li, she felt very disgusting. If it wasn\u2019t because of her, Yaoniang wouldn\u2019t go to Jin Wang Mansion to be a servant and serve other people\u2019s child, but she had to left her own child.But she didn\u2019t want to quarrel with Li. She didn\u2019t want to break peace for her younger sister. So she pulled the curtain down and entered the house again.Li was very uncomfortable about Huiniang\u2019s attitude. She wanted to rush into the door and quarrel with Huiniang, but was pulled by Yan\u2019er who came out of the west chamber.Yan\u2019er pulled Li into the room.\u201cMom, You don\u2019t need to argue with her. She is annoyed for sending the fox bitch, her sister, away. If you quarrel with her, she will become so sad and cry to tell brother when he comes back. It won\u2019t be good if he asks Yaoniang continue to stay here.\u201d o When Li heard what she said, Li felt she was right and gave her a glance then said, \u201cYou agreed with me before that you\u2019ll do all housework after driving Yaoniang away. Where have you been in these two days? You don\u2019t do anything everyday even you want to marry someone. Be careful that your future husband will divorce you if you don\u2019t do housework.\u201dLi said this while stabbing Yan\u2019er\u2019s forehead with her fingers.Yan\u2019er felt painful, but she didn\u2019t dare to resist and she was reluctant to say: \u201cYou said that I\u2019m going to marry someone. I have to take good care of myself now. If not, I should be a joke after I get married. By the way, did you mention it to brother to go Chen family talking about the marriage between Chen An and I?\u201dLi was very angry and said: \u201cDon\u2019t be anxious. How can I mention it at this time? If I talk about now, your sister-in-law will quarrel with me again. After Yaoniang leaves, I\u2019ll tell your brother later.\u201d\u201cThen you should do it as soon as possible.\u201dLi glared at her daughter and returned to the room. Yan\u2019er looked outside at the door. There was no movement on the other side of the main room, and there was no one in east chamber, then she went out quietly.She walked out of the alley and turned into a remote alley.As soon as she reached the door of a house, she was dragged in by a figure coming out of it.He was a dark-skinned boy. He was not tall, but he was very strong and looked like a small hill.This person was the black boy Feng Heizi said by Li.Yan\u2019er was startled by him and said: \u201cWhy did you ask Mao Dan to call me out?\u201dFeng Heizi smiled, \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you for a few days, I miss you.\u201dYan\u2019er looked at him with some disgust and said: \u201cMy mother doesn\u2019t allow me to go out recently, and my brother has watched me very closely, saying that you taught me bad things.\u201dFeng Heizi said: \u201cBut you asked me to help you. You can\u2019t put all the blame on me\u2026\u201d Seeing Yan\u2019er staring at himself, he quickly turned the tone: \u201cOkay, it\u2019s me. But she bullied you, so I helped you to give a lesson to her. And you agreed at the beginning that if I do it for you, you have to kiss me.\u201dHe said and grinned. Then he moved his face to Yan\u2019er.Yan\u2019er pushed him away impatiently. \u201cGo away. I\u2019m going to marry someone in the future. How can I kiss you?\u201d\u201cWho do you want to marry besides me?\u201d\u201cIt won\u2019t be you anyway. I\u2019ll go if you don\u2019t have anything to tell me, lest if your mother come back and see me later.\u201d There were only two people in Feng family. Feng Heizi and his mother widow Feng. Feng Heizi\u2019s father died early, and he was raised by widow Feng who worked hard to wash clothes outside.Before Yan\u2019er took two steps, she was dragged back severely, raising her eyes to meet with the dark face of Feng Heizi.\u201cMao Dan said that you like that man, but that man likes your sister-in-law\u2019 younger sister. So you would\u2026\u201d Feng Heizi\u2019s face and his eyes were a little scary: \u201cHonestly, am I saying the truth?\u201dInexplicable, Yan\u2019er was a little anxious.She remembered what Feng Heizi did usually. He gathered a group of young bastards on the street to swindle, cause trouble, and interrupt people. He even broke people\u2019s arms and legs. Recently he became a hatchet man in a brothel. She suddenly realized that the man in front of her was no longer the black boy who had grown up with her and obeyed to her orders because he liked her.\u201cMao Dan said nonsense. Don\u2019t listen to him. I usually don\u2019t go out, so I only know you and Mao Dan. There is no chance for me to know someone else and fall in love with other people.\u201d She pretended to be impatient, and at the same time begged: \u201cI really should go back. I secretly came out and my mother doesn\u2019t know. If my brother knows, he will break my leg. I will come out to see you when I have time.\u201dFeng Heizi didn\u2019t stop her again this time. She hurriedly stepped out of Feng family\u2019s door.However, Feng Heizi looked at her back with a grim eyes, and no one knew what he was thinking.Li still couldn\u2019t resist her curiosity and secretly asked Yao Cheng.Yao Cheng couldn\u2019t bear that his mother asked this thing so many times, so he told her the truth.Li learned that Yaoniang would work in royal mansion and earned so much for a month. She was immediately jealous and asked Yao Cheng to send her sister to royal mansion as a maid.Yao Cheng was very impatient: \u201cIt needs to sign a contract of selling oneself if working in royal mansion. Are you willing to let Yan\u2019er be a maid for a lifetime? And now she is too old to be a maid, and they don\u2019t want to agree such a big girl to work in royal mansion.\u201d\u201cHow can Yaoniang go?\u201dYao Cheng said patiently: \u201cYao Niang is going to be a wet nurse.\u201dLi murmured: \u201cIt turned out that there are such advantages if not being a unmarried girl\u2026\u201dYao Cheng left without hearing what Li said next. He was afraid that he couldn\u2019t help but kicked his mother.After Li knew it, she walked around in front of Huiniang and Yaoniang the next morning. She was also very attentive. She prepared breakfast early in the morning and said that she knew that Yaoniang was leaving today and she prepared delicious food for her before going.Yaoniang couldn\u2019t help but glanced at her. But today she was leaving and she didn\u2019t want to cause any troubles, so she ate breakfast in silence, only pretending not to see Li.\u201cYaoniang, you will not be an ordinary people after you go to the royal mansion. You will get much more salaries. You put Xiaobao in our house and do you think it is necessary to give us some allowance.\u201d At the time, Yao Cheng went out to see if Madam Liu\u2019s horse cart was coming, and Li finally came to the point.As soon as Huiniang heard what she said, she was so annoyed and said: \u201cMom, Xiaobao eats my breast milk, not yours. I am willing to raise my younger sister\u2019s child. I am his aunt. You can\u2019t ask allowance to my younger sister!\u201dLi reluctantly hummed: \u201cThat\u2019s my Hong\u2019er ration. I\u2019m Hong\u2019er\u2019s grandmother, of course I should care.\u201d She also knew that when her son came in, it wouldn\u2019t be possible to say this kind of thing. So she didn\u2019t talk to Huiniang and directly spoke with Yaoniang. She knew that Yaoniang was honest and easier to bully than HuiNiang.\u201cYaoniang, do you think you should give the allowance or not?\u201dYaoniang kept lowering her eyes. When she heard this, she raised her eyes without any expression on her face, but her hands resting under the table were clenched.\u201cSure. Ma\u2019am, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll give some money to you every month when I get the salaries.\u201dLi got a satisfactory answer and turned away. Presumably she was also afraid that Huiniang would quarrel with her.Huiniang said anxiously: \u201cYaoniang, don\u2019t care about what she said. Xiaobao is my nephew. I am willing to take care of him and I don\u2019t want to ask money from you.\u201dYaoniang took her hand and whispered, \u201cSister, listen to me. I\u2019ve caused too much troubles to you. After all, she is your mother-in-law. If she is not happy. I can\u2019t rest assured to let Xiaobao live here. I\u2019m afraid that she will quarrel with you every day. You also know that after I work in royal mansion, I will have much more salaries. So I don\u2019t care about such money that I will give to your family. I don\u2019t know when I will come back. I can only rely on you about feeding and clothing Xiaobao. Only using money can buy food and clothes. If Xiaobao lives and eats here for free, I will feel uneasy.\u201dHuiniang was so sad, and didn\u2019t know what to say.She understood what her younger sister thought about. She didn\u2019t want her younger sister was in a pickle. Her younger sister was so considerate and kind, why the god doesn\u2019t love her?This question had been asked countless times by herself, and she had not been able to get an answer. She could only hold her younger sister to cry.Actually, Yaoniang did something on this day. She told herself to stop crying countless times. It\u2019s no use to cry and still couldn\u2019t solve the problems. She should try to make herself laugh. But at this time, she could not help but cried.Yao Cheng walked in from the outside hurriedly and saw this scene.\u201cWhy do you cry? Oh, Madam Liu\u2019s horse cart is here.\u201dYaoniang wiped her tears and the tears on Huiniang\u2019s face, then she stood up and went to the inner house to see Xiaobao again. Xiaobao slept soundly, and his little mouth curled as if she was still eating her mother\u2019s breast milk in his sleep.Yaoniang didn\u2019t dare to look any longer, then she grabbed a small bag next to her and turned her head to run out.When she got into the horse cart, Huiniang grabbed the cart window and telling Yaoniang to take care of herself, and don\u2019t worry about the family. She could come back to visit home if she was free. If she can\u2019t work well in the royal mansion, she could come back and still stay at her home.Yaoniang nodded again and again with tears in her eyes.Madam Liu was impatient and interrupted by saying that it was not too early, and Huiniang stopped to grab the cart window.The horse trot forwarded all the way, hitting a pleasant rhythm on the blue stone slab road.Yaoniang poked her head out of the cart window, and said to Huiniang who was still standing outside the door: \u201cSister, don\u2019t worry. I will take good care of myself. Please get into the house.\u201dTears were in Huiniang\u2019s eyes and she nodded.Watching her elder sister and brother-in-law\u2019s figures getting smaller and smaller, Yaoniang turned back and sat in the horse cart until she couldn\u2019t see them. Madam Liu smiled and looked at her: \u201cWell, wipe your tears. That\u2019s really a good job that everyone else can\u2019t find. You can still go home sometimes. If you work well in royal mansion, you will have a day off every month, and then you can keep the holidays and come back.\u201d\u201cOK.\u201dThere was a row of houses located at the back door of Jin Wang Mansion, covering a wide area. Most of the servants in Jin Wang Mansion lived here.Madam Liu also lived here.When she returned, her husband Hu Lai was not here. Then she cleaned up the messy house first, and changed new clothes to wear.Madam Liu was in a good mood with a smile on her face and wind on her feet, and everyone was curious, \u201cHu Lai\u2019 wife, do you pick up gold?\u201dEveryone was actually very curious. Since her husband Hu Lai lost his job and was addicted with gambling, she lost her temper every day and seldom went back home. Every time she came back, she had to quarrel with Hu Lai. This time Madam Liu returned to her parents\u2019 home, and her man Hu Lei disappeared for a few days. People living here were next to each other. What happened nearby will be known to all the neighbors. It was obvious that this time Hu Lai was also obsessed with gambling and he wouldn\u2019t go home until he lost all money in it.People thought about Hu Lai\u2019s wife would be very angry when she came back. But she was even looked very happy, which made people very curious.Madam Liu gave a glance at the woman who wanted to laugh at her and said with a smile: \u201cI didn\u2019t pick up the gold, but step on a stinky shit. You see that the shit is so annoying, and it wants to stick on my heels!\u201dThe woman were also clever. Naturally, she knew that Madam Liu was scolding herself. She became ashamed suddenly and yelled: \u201cDon\u2019t be proud. You probably don\u2019t know that Hu Lai went to gamble again!\u201dAfter speaking, the woman retracted her head into the door.Madam Liu\u2019s face became so dark, and she scolded countless times in her heart. But when she thought that she would soon be appreciated by the consort of Wangye, she immediately swept the haze in her heart.She entered into Jin Wang Mansion from the back door and walked along the trail all the way through the back garden to Siyi Yard.When she arrived at Siyi Yard and crossed the shadow wall. There were seven main rooms with seven frames. There were a side room, a wing room on both sides, front and back rooms, which carved beams and painted buildings. It looked magnificent and very elegant.There were several maids in green leather jackets standing under the porch of the main room. She walked next to the roots of the wall and said with a smile: \u201cHong\u2019er Guniang, I have something to tell Madam Li. I wonder if she is here?\u201dThe girl named Hong\u2019er looked at her for a while before realizing that she was Madam Liu, who was in charge of flowers and plants in the royal mansion. Knowing that she and Madam Li knew each other and she also did some errands for royal princess, she said, \u201cWait here. I\u2019ll go in and take your message.\u201dWith a smile on her face, Madam Liu nodded and went to the side of the wall and drew back her hand to stand.The author has something to say:I know everyone is anxious to let Yaoniang get into the royal mansion soon, but there are a few important hints foreshadowing later developments in this chapter.Notes: If you like this novel, maybe you can give a high rate on NU. Its rating is so low now and I\u2019m afraid some readers will miss it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was a tea room.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dMrs. Liu smiled flatteringly and said, \u201cWell, since the last time you mentioned it to me, I have paid much attention to it. Last few days I went back to my parents\u2019 home and met a wonderful and beautiful person introduced by my sister.\u201dMadam Li was very busy, and she forgot what she had mentioned with Madam Liu.It wasn\u2019t until Madam Liu saw her intentional smile that she remembered she took part in a banquet with some women in the royal mansion and eating together. Finally many women were drunk. She and Madam Liu were sober. She was so overwhelmed by alcohol, and she couldn\u2019t help but talked to Madam Liu about annoying things. She even forgot about it, and never thought that Madam Liu would remember it in her heart.Madam Li raised her eyebrows almost inconceivably, and there was a kind of impatience and her voice chilled: \u201cWhat wonderful woman makes Madam Liu like having a precious gem?\u201dMadam Liu was only immersed in joy, and she did not notice the cold attitude of Madam Li: \u201cShe is a wonderful person. I take my life to guarantee. Frankly and boldly speaking, I have never seen anyone was more beautiful than this person in this huge royal mansion.\u201dMadam Li wanted to talk to her casually at first, but when Madam Liu said so, she was curious.\u201cLooks very pure and beautiful?\u201dMadam Liu smiled ambiguously: \u201cNot only that.\u201d\u201cHow about comparing with Liu Chunguan?\u201d\u201cNo worse than her!\u201d Madam Liu patted her chest and said, \u201cAnyway, if you believe me, you can have a look on her. If you are not satisfied with her, I won\u2019t show up in front of you next time.\u201dAlthough Madam Liu had some disadvantages, in general she was not a person who liked to brag. Maybe it would be a really outstanding person that made her have such attitudes.Madam Li thought in her heart and said, \u201cThat\u2019s OK. Since you said that, I\u2019m not going to see her. Exactly several wet nurses chosen these days and you can take her and mix her in them tomorrow. Then bring them to royal mansion and have a look.\u201dMadam Liu slapped with joy, \u201cOkay, rest assured. I must take care of this well. I didn\u2019t bring her into royal mansion because I\u2019m afraid that someone will discover. I specially arrange her staying outside.\u201dWhen Madam Li heard this, she had a little appreciation for Madam Liu\u2019s caution and said to her a few words before leaving.Then, Madam Liu went out of Siyi Yard with joy, and walked out of royal mansion again through the back door.Madam Liu came to pick up Yaoniang from the inn in the early morning.She first took her to eat something delicious, and advised the matters and rules that should be noticed after entering the royal mansion before leaving, and then led Yaoniang to Jin Wang Mansion.Jin Wang Mansion was as grand and solemn as in Yaoniang\u2019s memory.The two entered the house from the west side door and passed through the courtyards along the way. Yaoniang didn\u2019t squint. Madam Liu even liked her when she saw her. She thought the little lady was very obedient.The superior people liked obedient subordinates who were easy to control.They came to a flower hall where five or six young women were waiting. They were all fair-skinned and plump, and at first glance they had just given birth.Yaoniang also just gave birth a short time ago, but not as round as these little women. She was a bit fatter than before, but she was well-balanced. The fat parts should be fat, and the thin parts should be thin. She looked more like a plump gourd.As soon as Yaoniang walked in, everyone drew the attention because of her outstanding appearance, and also because she did not look like a wet nurse.It seemed that they also knew that there were many rules in the royal mansion. These little women looked up for a few moments before lowering their heads again. Madam Liu winked at Yaoniang, and Yaoniang went to stand among them.The consort of Jin Wang just got up in the main room of Siyi Yard.A row of several girls in blue beacons holding copper pots, kettles, face towels, tea cups and other things, stood near the Babu bed carved with flower pear, ganoderma lucidum, ruyi and moon.Consort of Jin Wang had dizziness and she had to sit on bed for a while after she woke up. She used to be a well-behaved person, so her maids and Mommy were well disciplined in Siyi Yard. Standing and holding with such heavy things, their arms and legs didn\u2019t tremble.Ziyan lifted her up and put a soft cushion behind her to let her sit, and then brought a bowl of ginseng tea to serve her. After drinking some ginseng tea with red dates, consort Jin finally felt more comfortable, and her pale face which was almost transparent became red.\u201cI think the prescription given by doctor Liu doesn\u2019t have any effect.\u201d Madam Zhou said.Madam Zhou was in her fifties with a round face and a fair complexion. Wearing an indigo-colored mule and a turquoise horse-faced skirt, black hair pulled her back in her head and fixed it with a simple gold hairpin, she looked very clean and decent.She was the nursing mommy of consort Jin. She served consort Jin when she was a little girl. When consort Jin got married, she followed with consort Jin and came into Jin Wang Mansion. So she was specially decent in Jin Wang Mansion.Consort Jin frowned. She looked very tired and said, \u201cDoctor Liu Liang\u2019s medicine is still useful, but it\u2019s my fault and I still have dizziness.\u201d\u201cThe dizziness of consort was much better than before, but I think you were obstructed by Liu Chunguan. Wangye shouldn\u2019t take that woman back\u2026\u201dConsort Jin put the tea cup which was in her hand into the tray held by a maid next to her, and spit out the tea into a spittoon held by the other girl. Ziyan picked up a white piece of handkerchief to help her wiping the corner of the mouth. Then she said, \u201cOkay. No more talking, wet nurse.\u201dHer tone was flat and there was no condemnation, but madam Zhou stopped talking immediately.The maidservants went up to serve consort Jin to wash teeth and mouth and apply moisturizing facial oil cream continuously, and then they went out in turn.Ziyan helped consort Jin up from bed.Consort Jin came to the dressing table and sat down. Ziyan picked up a rhino horn comb and combed her hair. She needed to comb more than one hundred times.Now there were only the henchmen of consort Jin in this room. They could talk about inner words naturally.Consort Jin said: \u201cWet nurse, you have to control yourself not to talk much outside. You can\u2019t criticize masters. Your are my wet nurse and I don\u2019t care that you discuss about me. But you shouldn\u2019t forget who the real master is in this mansion.\u201dObviously it\u2019s Jin Wang.No one can discuss Jin Wang here, even if the person was the nursing mommy of the consort.Madam Zhou was embarrassed and said, \u201cI know now. But I am worried about you. Liu Chunguan is bad girl, who came out from the brothel dare against with you intentionally\u2026\u201dAfter mentioning this, Madam Zhou was a little bit angry again.Madam Zhou was a good person but she was a little bit wordy. In fact, she was not wordy to others. Because she raised the consort up and almost treated her as her own daughter. So she was too angry for the consort.Consort Jin was a noble, and her aunt was a imperial consort. She was also the legitimate daughter in Xu Guogong Mansion so she grew up in a happy and rich family. She was beautiful and people called her talented girl when she was young. She was regarded as the goddess of heaven because of her noble identity and talents.When the moon is at its full,it begins to wane; when the water is full, it overflew. Consort Jin was almost a perfect woman but only one thing that was not good was that her body was weak from an early age.However, with such a noble identity, she could find many famous doctors and valuable medicinal materials. She grew up and married with Jin Wang as a consort.Although Jin Zhou was a frontier fortress, Jin Wang was the emperor\u2019s brother. Jin Zhou belonged to Jin Wang and all goods things in Jin Zhou would be sent to Jin Wang first. There were also many valuable things sending from Xu Guogong Mansion, not to mention the rewards from the royal palace. So consort Jin still had a high-fed life here and even better than she was in Guogong Mansion.Consort Jin took good care of herself and had a delicate life, but she still didn\u2019t get better. She had been married with Jin Wang for seven years, and she still wasn\u2019t pregnant.In this regard, consort Jin could still blame that Jin Wang spent less time in the mansion and he was in the border town for most of the year. He was so busy even he came back into the mansion and seldom stayed in the backyard. But in the spring of last year, Jin Wang actually brought a woman back from outside.That woman was side consort Hu.From the moment she entered the mansion, she was doted much by Jin Wang. Jin Wang who had always been indifferent before stayed with Liu Chunguan every night. It didn\u2019t take long for her to enter the mansion and she gave birth to the first child of Jin Wang, that was the little princess.And side consort Hu became noble after she had a child with Jin Wang. Then she became the side consort.What matters is not wanting but unfairness. If a person had something, and another person didn\u2019t possess, so the person would be jealous. Also side consort Hu was always a proud and swanking woman, which made people dislike her.Madam Zhou hated side consort Hu, and she wanted to eat her meat and drink her blood. She thought it\u2019s because she\u2019s a fox bitch which made Jin Wang always stay with her. So the consort couldn\u2019t give birth to a child.Madam Zhou gritted her teeth, and consort Jin was not angry but laughed.She had a pair of phoenix eyes and arch eyebrows. Her body was weak and her face was pale. At first glance she was so weak as to be unable to stand any breeze. But she smiled like spring flower blooming in March, and was very beautiful.After laughing, seeing Madam Zhou still looked sullen, she couldn\u2019t help but smiled and comforted her: \u201cWell, wet nurse. You also know my body\u2019s situation. I can\u2019t suffer any pain to give birth to a child. If she has the ability to give birth to a son, let her do it! If she really does it, I will take her son here to raise.\u201dMadam Zhou said with disagreed attitude, \u201cPlease don\u2019t think I am too wordy, consort. You are the consort of Jin Wang. The first son in the Jin Wang Mansion should be given birth by you. How can her son be compared with your biological one?\u201dMadam Zhou said many times to consort Jin with these words, but she never seemed to take it seriously.Consort Jin looked at herself in the mirror, and she frowned.\u201cWet nurse, I have my own opinion on this matter, so don\u2019t worry about it.\u201dMadam Zhou didn\u2019t want to worry about it, but can she? She also saw that the consort was unhappy with her words. Thinking about Jin Wang treated the consort very indifferently and she didn\u2019t dare to say it directly to consort Jin, she could only sigh deeply in her heart. She also said, \u201cThe wet nurses found for the princess arrive here and they are waiting in the flower hall of Yun Pavilion. Do you want to go and have a look?\u201d\u201cI heard Madam Li said that they had find a good person. That\u2019s the case. I\u2019ll go and see after I have breakfast.\u201d\u201cMadam Li is also straightforward.\u201dZiyan grinned aside and said: \u201cIt was me who told the consort and I also want to share the worries of consort, so I couldn\u2019t help but said.\u201dMadam Li was the mother of Ziyan. Both of them were henchmen of consort Jin. Madam Li was in charge of chores in the back house and she usually didn\u2019t serve personally beside consort Jin.\u201cI know you two are loyal to consort.\u201dAfter a gossip, consort Jin went to Yun Pavilion with servants after having breakfast.In Yun Pavilion, Yaoniang had stood here for more than half an hour.Her waist was painful and her legs trembled, but no one else was better than her.There were only a few people in this flower hall, and no one was watching them. Someone could not help but took a chance and sit down in the chair next to them, intending to rest. One went to sit, then two or three followed. Only Yaoniang was still standing stupidly.Yaoniang looked at little women sitting there rubbing their legs and waist, and then they all stared at her. Knowing that everyone was sitting, but she was still standing then she walked over.The young women talked much when they sit together. They chatted with each other and still no one came here, so they chat more excitedly.Yaoniang used to be quiet, so she listened to them.She knew a lot after listening to their conversations.She knew that they all had relationships with the mansion and most of them were relatives with who those working in the royal mansion as servants. In fact, it\u2019s good to work in royal mansion. They didn\u2019t need to do hard jobs and could earn a lot of salaries. Meanwhile, they didn\u2019t need to sign a death deed. Only people who had relationships with royal mansion could come in.Two younger women did not speak, and Yaoniang paid a lot of attention to them.It\u2019s right to say that she paid much attention to one of them. She lost her job as a wet nurse in her last life because that woman framed her.Notes: If you like this novel, please give a high rate on NU, I\u2019m afraid someone will miss this.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 8": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Jin Wang Dotes on His ConcubineCH 8Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe cool breeze blew gently in Heyun Pavilion. It was sunny outside and sunshine shone on the green glazed tiles, arousing a golden light.It was only in April but the weather in Jin Zhou was a little hot. People were dizzy under the sun.But all this had nothing to do with Heyun Pavilion.Heyun Pavilion was built in the back garden of the royal palace. The garden was lush with flowers and trees, and was facing the water. A breeze blew that would be so cool. Birds were chanting on the branches. What a fine day!Yaoniang only sit on a half-part of chair and lowered her eyelids. No one knew what she was thinking.And just as she was thinking about her own mind, someone across from her was watching her.Cuizhu\u2019s mother worked on a village, which was a dowry taken by consort Jin, and she married with the head of the village. Unfortunately, she had a bad life. Her husband died as soon as she was pregnant. There was no one in her husband\u2019s family. There were her brother and sister-in-law so she couldn\u2019t just stay and rely on her mother\u2019s family. Then she asked someone to help her to get a job as a wet nurse in the mansion.Cuizhu\u2019s aunt was a Mammy in charge of daily chores subordinating to the consort. Similar to her job, there were no less than ten Mammies subordinating to the consort. Everyone performed their duties. But since the person on the top wanted to do something, the person on the bottom was bound to know a little bit, and Cuizhu knew things that others didn\u2019t know.She was just aiming at this, so she didn\u2019t care about anything in order to work as a wet nurse.Cuizhu had already wanted to work in the mansion a long time ago. But her mother was the maid of consort Jin. She knew the consort\u2019s personality and did not want her daughter to get in the mansion and put her under the patronage of a higher-up so as not to harm a family member. Therefore, if there were girls with a good look like Cuizhu from Xu family, she wouldn\u2019t send them to the consort.For this matter, Cuizhu complained more than once to her father and mother, feeling that if they did not stop her, she would not marry such a person and finally became a widow.This time the news spread and Cuizhu remembered. She was willing to work in the mansion but leaving her daughter who was only three months home.This was her only way out.Cuizhu also knew that there would only be two people left chosen by the top this time, and the other person facing her was the enemy.When the person walked in, Cuizhu knew that this person must have the same purpose with her, otherwise she wouldn\u2019t be able to become a wet nurse.This kind of person would make troubles for master.Cuizhu bit her bright lower lip, and couldn\u2019t help but clenched her cuffs and looked over. She was full of jealousy.For today, she deliberately wore her most beautiful clothes. Her hair was freshly washed, and she was specially put on osmanthus-based head oil. Her bun was combed by her mother and wore her gold hair pin.Cuizhu loved to be pretty since she was a child, and she also liked to prick up herself. After giving birth to her daughter, she was deliberately on a diet so her figure had already recovered. From Cuizhu\u2019s own perspective, she was definitely better than before when she was unmarried. Because only married women knew that even the younger girls were very beautiful but still couldn\u2019t compare with women who were married.But she\u2013Cuizhu once again looked at the person sitting opposite with jealous red eyes, and wished to scratch her face to relieve her anger!Yaoniang always felt that someone was glaring at herself and raised her head to see the jealous look from the opposite side. Although the other side lowered her eyes quickly, she still looked clearly.She was a little palpitated.Because of the other person\u2019s eyes. If this kind of look was not hatred or grudge, who would look at people like that.Yaoniang smiled bitterly in the heart. She suffered a lot in her last life. When she first entered the mansion, she was not at all concerned. She was only self-blame. She only missed her son because she had no choice but to leave behind. It was only once she was almost killed that she finally cheered up and worked to save her life. Therefore, many things that happened when she first entered the mansion were not clear in Yao Niang\u2019s memory. She couldn\u2019t remember whether Cuizhu had seen herself this way in her last life.At the same time, she could not help wondering why Cuizhu showed such a look.After all, now that she had just entered the mansion and the wet nurse who would take care of the little princess wasn\u2019t be chosen. Cuizhu and she were not rivals, so why did she be so jealous to Yaoniang?Could it be said that Cuizhu also revived once?Immediately Yaoniang thought she thought too much. Because when she died in the last life, Cuizhu was still good and she was doing her majestic job as a wet nurse beside the little princess.If Cuizhu did not reborn, why did she look at Yaoniang in this way?There was only one explanation that maybe Cuizhu knew something. Or because she was already a candidate decided internally, she would be so hostile to her. But none of this made sense. After all, even if Cuizhu was chosen internally, she was not. Why should the other party be so hostile to her?Yaoniang was not a very intelligent person. If she couldn\u2019t figure it out for a while, she wouldn\u2019t think about it. But it left a shadow in her heart owing to this thing.Suddenly someone cleared throat outside the door.Suddenly, people who were sitting stood up and looked at the girl standing outside the door with a stunned look.This girl was not very old and about twelve or thirteen years old. She looked at the crowd with a small white face, then turned her head and left.While everyone was nervous, several older women walked in from outside.They were decently dressed, with a solemn face and extraordinary manners. At first glance, they knew that they were the Mammies in charge of the daily affairs in the royal palace.The first woman combed with a single bun which was slick. She had a long face and looked extremely serious. Wearing a dark red silk shirt, covered with turquoise bijia, below was a turquoise horse-face skirt. Only an old silver hair pin was inserted on the head, a pair of cat-eye earrings hanging on her ears, and her eyes was like a pair of cat-eye that were shinning and bright. At first glance she was not easy to get along.Yaoniang knew this person. She was Madam Li around the consort and was in charge of many affairs in the mansion and could be regarded as one of the helpers around the consort.However, Yaoniang had also seen this person smile when she welcomed people. That was, she was just doted by Jin Wang, and the consort respected her, so people around consort also respected her.Although Yaoniang only spent more than a year in the royal palace, she also saw many changeable and unstable people in the mansion. They smiled in front of people but the next moment were full of contempt secretly. By the same token, if someone had the power, they would respect and regard the person as master. If someone lost his power, he would not be respected and was even worse than a dog.Yaoniang saw many times in the mansion that maids respectfully called her Madam Yao in front of her, but when they turned to their head to say that she was a seductress.She was angry and sad, but also with flagging interest.Fortunately, she would never have to face all this in her life. Yaoniang thought about it before entering the mansion. The reason why she would die in her last life was to obstruct others\u2019 eyes. As long as she was not designed by Cuizhu, she could safely be a wet nurse beside the little princess, and no longer had to mess with affairs in the backyard of Jin Wang.She didn\u2019t have to do it for a long time. It would be done in a year or two. She would leave the place with enough money to bring up Xiaobao.Thinking about this, Yaoniang calmed down and accepted the scrutiny of the above women.\u201cAre you healthy? Do you have enough breast milk? Working in the mansion is different from other places. You are going to take care of the little princess so it doesn\u2019t allow to make any mistakes.\u201dA few quick-spoken women responded quickly, and Madam Li frowned imperceptibly without showing impatience, but just ignored them and asked a little girl next to her: Does he come?\u201dThe little girl said clearly, \u201cYes, he\u2019s waiting outside.\u201dAfter a while, an old man over half a century old walked in, followed by a small boy carrying a medicine box.\u201cThis is our doctor at the Medical Center in the Jin Wang Mansion and he will feel pulse for all of you.\u201dEveryone went to the doctor one by one and stretched out wrists to let doctor feel the pulse. In fact, one person seemed to have been diagnosed with a hidden disease, and a servant took her away. When the little woman was taken away, she still screamed injustice, saying that she was healthy all the time and would never dare to deceive.Because of this, everyone couldn\u2019t help but felt a little bit frightened. But it was so complicated to choose a wet nurse. But Yaoniang knew that the complexity was still behind.Madam Li glanced at a few people and instructed: \u201cTake them and look at them in the room.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe few women bowed their heads to answer, and led Yaoniang and others into the dark room inside.Yaoniang had this kind of experience in last life. Because it was too unforgettable, Yaoniang remembered it very clearly.It was the first time that she was naked in front of an outsider, and she was watched by people closely. So it was still fresh in her memory in addition to her humiliation.The woman who inspected her was very careful. She not only checked for acne, but even sniffed her armpits. She was lying on a cloth-covered long narrow table and inspected the unspeakable place.The woman was also afraid that Yaoniang would be frightened. She said while checking: \u201cThe little princess is the only daughter of Wangye, but also the granddaughter of the emperor. She was born with noble. Jin Zhou is different from the capital, so it has to select a good wet nurse for the little princess outside. But it must be chosen carefully. Once if there are some accidents happened to the little princess, it is just a matter of losing one\u2019s head\u2026 \u201cYaoniang bit her lip and closed her eyes. She didn\u2019t speak. She felt like the woman was touching her chest and listening to her saying, \u201cYou have enough breast milk from looking. Well, Everything is good. Please come down.\u201dShe came down from the long narrow table quickly and lowered her head then put on her clothes.After she went out, she saw that everyone looked different. Apparently they encountered the same situation.While everyone was waiting for the follow-up, Madam Li did not speak but went out. Several other women stayed in the flower hall.This didn\u2019t seem to be surprising, but Yaoniang couldn\u2019t help paying attention.Madam Li went out and turned to the left.If she left Heyun Pavilion, she should go straight out. Why did she go there?Where was that place?Yaoniang wrestled with her thoughts, and suddenly her heart tightened.Oh, she remembered where it was.Heyun Pavilion was an ordinary place to entertain guests. When it hosted a feast in royal palace to the officials of the landlord, the consort also hosted the family members of the officials in the back house.At that time, Yaoniang belonged to Jin Wang. She couldn\u2019t come such a place because of her identity. That day she enjoyed flowers in the garden but took the wrong way, so she came to the vicinity of Heyun Pavilion.The Heyun Pavilion covered a large area. One side faced the water, and the other side faced the flower room. She was greedy for the peony flower that bloomed well, and turned aside. When she was watching the flowers, she suddenly heard a voice and she couldn\u2019t help looking for it. It happened that she was standing in the position where she could see the situation in Heyun Pavilion from the outside.She tried to think where it was, but it was just this flower hall.Looking at the golden three-legged censer in the corner, because it\u2019s too conspicuous and she saw it at first glance. At that time, there were only a few gorgeous ladies in this flower hall, and Yaoniang was always timid. She was in a hurry because she was afraid that she might be mistaken for what she wanted to peep.But because she was so impressed, she always remembered it.Yaoniang subconsciously looked at an inconspicuous flower window on the side. The flower window was scarlet red overall, with various beautiful patterns hollowed out on it, followed by large green leaves. At first glance, nothing seemed abnormal, but if looked closely, the lush foliage seemed to tremble faintly.Someone was behind.Who? Who was watching there?Yaoniang didn\u2019t dare to look at it anymore. She turned her head to pretend nothing happened, but she was still staring at there.That lush branch suddenly trembled a few times, and there was no other movement until she saw a section of clothing with a complicated pattern swept it.But as Yaoniang saw this, she felt like being stroke by lightning.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 9": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Jin Wang Dotes on His ConcubineCH 9Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAs for such fabric and familiar pattern, Yaoniang had only seen from consort Jin.Consort Jin preferred pharbitis and she liked to have pharbitis flowers on her clothes and jewelry. Yaoniang wasn\u2019t born with noble identity and she was inevitably curious when she saw more. She once could not help saying something in private, but she was smirked by her maid Die\u2019er.Die\u2019er said, that\u2019s not kaladana but pharbitis. Don\u2019t say that again, lest other people would make laugh at her. Maybe it would offend the consort.Since then, Yaoniang had never dared to say more, but she had firmly remembered this thing.But why did consort stand there and look inside? As the hostess of the mansion, she could go as far as the whole mansion. She didn\u2019t have to hide herself.Then there was only one possibility that the consort did not want people inside to know that she had been there.But why?When Yaoniang suddenly remembered that she was doted in her last life, side consort Hu was very angry and said something to her.She said that Yaoniang was a fool, and willingly followed the consort to obey her. Yaoniang didn\u2019t know who made her encounter a lot of difficulties and would surely die in consort Jin\u2019s hand in the future.At that time, she didn\u2019t take her words to heart, because she felt that the other party was just resentful. Because of hate, and she deliberately provoked alienation. At first, she was tortured by side consort Hu, and she had a plan of climbing the bed. After the incident, an emergency report came from the border city, and Jin Wang went directly to the border city and did not set her up at all, but she was still controlled by side consort Hu.When side consort Hu wanted to use lynching because of her jealousy, it was the consort who rescued her and gave her a righteous identity, not just the girl who climbed the bed whenever she was mentioned.Because of all this, Yaoniang had always been grateful to consort Jin. Even after knowing that consort Jin was using her to against side consort Hu, she did not rebel. She always remembered that when she was most isolated and helpless, consort Jin helped her and kept giving her respect and honor in the mansion to make her stand up.And the man who should have given her all was actually a bastard who just slept with her and did not care about anything else. This was the idea that had been kept in Yaoniang\u2019s heart in her last life.At this time, each nerve of Yaoniang was telling herself that things didn\u2019t seem so simple.She remembered the abnormality of Madam Liu when she was in Linyun County, thinking of Cuizhu looking at her eyes, thinking of the clothing corners that had just passed by, thinking of her various experiences in her last life, and those words said by side consort Hu\u2026Suddenly, there was a recognition that made her like falling into an ice cave. Perhaps her path was arranged by others from the beginning. No matter how she lived, she could not escape the control of the other party.So, everything had an explanation. Why Madam Liu was so attentive? Why Cuizhu hate her so much? And Why she did nothing when she went to Liuchun Pavilion, but people around side consort Hu always embarrassed her. Why did the consort show compassion for her? But after she returned from Liuchun Pavilion, she still became a servant for side consort Hu. Obviously if she really felt pity for her, she could allow Yaoniang to stay by her side\u2026Yaoniang remembered the eagle\u2013Jin Wang had a Hai Dongqing, a very beautiful but fierce and terrifying bird that never let outsiders get close, but it was very docile and obedient to Jin Wang.She saw it once and couldn\u2019t help but asked him curiously. That was the first time he had said so many things to her. Although there were only a few words, it made Yaoniang\u2019s memory fresh.In fact, this description was not appropriate, but the meaning was the same. They used various means to polish the will of the other party, to torture and oppress, until the other party had no way to go, until the other party lost their own will, and everything followed the intention of the master.Yaoniang was cold and suddenly found that her world had been completely subverted.And everything that happened next went like the last life.Yaoniang and Cuizhu were picked, and the rest got five silvers rewards and were led away from the mansion.Madam Li took the two to Siyi Yard. The consort Jin didn\u2019t say much, but just let them serve the little princess master with heart, and then they were led by a servant away.After the two went down, consort Jin praised Madam Li and said that she had a good vision. Consort Jin was cold by nature, and being able to say such words meant that she was very satisfied with this errand.It\u2019s obvious that she was satisfied with Yaoniang.Even though consort Jin was experienced and knowledgeable, this was the first time she had seen such a wonderful person. After thinking for many times, she could only use the word \u201cwonderful\u201d to describe this. Other words were not only inappropriate, but too indecent.\u201cThanks for your praising, consort. It was also Madam Liu who found the woman by chance. Owing to Liu\u2019s contributions and burn the incense that made consort satisfied.\u201d\u201cReward her.\u201d Consort Jin smiled. No one knew what she thought and the light flew in her eyes that made people feel a little bit more glamorous and couldn\u2019t look straight.\u201cSend a message to Liuchun Pavilion. The person will be sent over tomorrow.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d*When side consort Hu heard a message from the servant at Liuchun Pavilion, she immediately smashed the rouge box in her hand.She wore a paeja with gold flowers around her waist and a magenta silk skirt, a peach-colored heart bun on her head, and a full set of red gold inlaid with ruby jewelry. Really beautiful and glorious!She had a slender oval face. Probably because her skin was extremely white, and the dark, thick eyebrows and long eyelashes had a kind of brightness that made people dare not look at her. At this moment, her charming eyes were filled with anger and flames, and her plump breasts were rising and falling.Side consort Hu was trembling all over. She not only smashed the rouge box, but also wanted to smash all the things on the dressing table. Fortunately, she was held back by her maid Taohong from behind.\u201cWell, you all go down.\u201dThe two girls waiting aside, as well as the subordinates who came to give a message, all went down.Taohong then said to side consort Hu: \u201cMaster, you must not be angry, otherwise you will be duped by Siyi Yard.\u201dSide consort Hu was so angry that her fingers and lips were shaking, but she bit her lips tightly with her white teeth, which was full of blood, which was enough to prove her anger.\u201cHow could she do this to me? How\u2026\u201d Side consort Hu couldn\u2019t continue to speak.On the contrary, Taohong saw her master was so angry and she felt pity for master.She sighed in her heart and comforted: \u201cIn accordance with the rules of Jin Wang Mansion, the little princess needs four wet nurses. The consort Jin is not wrong if she does this. But if you\u2026\u201dTaohong did not say anything again, and side consort Hu understood what she meant.If she resented, it was her fault.But can it be the same?In fact, the reason why side consort Hu was so angry was not only because consort Jin always arranged some servants for her in public, but also because of another private thing.Not many people knew about it in the mansion. Even if someone knew it, no one dared to discuss it casually. It wasn\u2019t because they were afraid that side consort Hu would be unhappy, but for fear of exposing her sore spot.Speaking of this, it was necessary to talk about. According to the practice of Jin Wang Mansion, if the women gave birth to a child, they didn\u2019t need to feed with their breast milk. This was the case for ordinary wealthy people, not to mention the kids in rich and unique Jin Wang Mansion.The wet nurse of little princess was already chosen before side consort Hu gave birth. In order to avoid the consort may have some spoiled movements and injury to her own child, side consort Hu specially said it\u2019s Jin Wang\u2019s order to find a wet nurse outside. It was for the little princess could have breast milk to drink when she was born.It stood to reason that in this case, side consort Hu should not even open breast milk and asked the medical doctor directly to prescribe some medicines to milk withdrawal to press breast milk back so as to avoid suffering in the future. Generally, wealthy people dealt with this in such way. But side consort Hu not only failed to do so, but also ordered midwife to open breast milk for her, and even took a few medicines to stimulate the secretion of breast milk.At that time, some subordinates questioned her, but side consort Hu insisted firmly. People thought maybe because she was born in a poor family and she wanted to feed the little princess with her own. No one ever thought the little princess was fed by two wet nurses.There were dozens of people in Liuchun Pavilion, and it was inevitable that someone would spill the beans.Those who heard the news couldn\u2019t help wondering, side consort Hu tried so hard but not feed the little princess. What was her plan? Some people couldn\u2019t help thinking about the private affairs of some luxurious and wealthy families. In addition, there was also a rumor in the Jin Wang Mansion that side consort Hu was from a brothel. Naturally, some people naturally thought ill.The rumor spread fast privately in the mansion and side consort Hu tried desperately to hide it, so a few women in the backyard made a lot of fun with her.Side consort Hu was so embarrassed about this. Consort Jin suddenly ordered two wet nurses to look after princess. She heard that the two had good looking appearance. Jin Wang who made an inspection tour in fiefs would return recently. Who the two would look after? It\u2019s very clear.Side consort Hu didn\u2019t think wrongly. She thought that consort didn\u2019t respect her and wanted to make her embarrassed. She still tore her face down in front of people in the mansion.How can side consort Hu not be annoyed! She hated consort very much!\u201cShe looks so cold and inhumane. She\u2019s just a bitch\u2026\u201dWhen side consort Hu scolded, she frowned suddenly and pressed the placket on her chests subconsciously. She hurriedly pushed Taohong away and went inside.She didn\u2019t call any servants in, including Taohong.Taohong looked at her back and shook her head.*Consort Jin was in a good mood today.When she was in a good mood, the sky at Siyi Yard was brighter than usual.Seeing that the consort was in a good mood, Ziyan and other maids were more lively than usual, and seeing that the weather outside was better, then she asked consort to walk in the garden. It\u2019s not good to stay at house all the time.Consort Jin agreed directly and took people to the garden.As the spring blossomed in April, the garden was full of lush green color. It\u2019s so refreshing when looking at it.Consort Jin walked away for a while and went to the pool to feed the fish for a while. Someone came to report that side consort Hu in Liuchun Pavilion was angry and furious, and consort Jin laughed even more happily.Consort Jin was happy, and Madam Zhou was happy, too.From her point of view, as long as consort was happy, it\u2019s because ancestors blessed to her. Because of this, she specially ordered someone to give Yaoniang two new clothes and she also had special preferential treatment in food.Consort Jin didn\u2019t need to say such a trivial matter, and Madam Zhou could do it well. The servants can serve their masters so many years, that meant they\u2019re not simple characters.Yaoniang looked at the things in front of her, and the eyes of Cuizhu next to her were as sharp as knives.She sent away the little girl who had sent her things, and a burst of exhaustion burst into her heart.Yaoniang thought that she wasted her last life. With so many obvious clues, she didn\u2019t feel anything strange in her last life.She put the clothes on the bedside table and lay down on the bed.There were two canopy beds with tents hanging on the bed in a small room. Yaoniang went to bed and lowered the tent, which blocked Cuizhu\u2019s eyes.Seeing the other person didn\u2019t want to talk to her, Cuizhu was angry and hated her, then she made noises for a long time before stopping.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 10": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Jin Wang Dotes on His ConcubineCH 10Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayYaoniang was thinking about the way she should go in the future.After realizing that the consort had hidden intention from the beginning, she was more certain that she should hold on the errand as a wet nurse. As long as she stayed with little princess, she didn\u2019t have to mutter with the matters in the backyard of the mansion. In fact, if she didn\u2019t lose her errand in the last life, she wouldn\u2019t be a servant for side consort Hu, giving the other party a chance to make troubles on her.Many things had causes.A girl brought lunch to Yaoniang and Cuizhu at noon. Yaoniang\u2019s food box obviously had two more dishes than Cuizhu\u2019s.The meals of wet nurses were better than the other servants, but Yaoniang\u2019s food box had two more dishes than Cuizhu\u2019s.Yaoniang felt nervous for the thing the consort had done. Although she was not smart, she was also not stupid. Especially during one year in her last life in the mansion, she understood a lot of things she couldn\u2019t understand before.What surprised her was that Cuizhu saw it as if she hadn\u2019t seen it. She only thought the other party had changed her personality, but then she knew why Cuizhu did so. Because Cuizhu made two cuts on the clothes that she put on the table with unknown things.Yaoniang wasn\u2019t too clever, but she still felt that Cuizhu was stupid.There were only two of them in the room. How could she dare to destroy the clothes that consort rewarded? Isn\u2019t she afraid that Yaoniang would tell the consort? In her last life, Yaoniang made Cuizhu in trouble. Although she had a gentle personality, she still had her temper. She naturally would revenge once she was bullied by others obviously.In the end, Cuizhu was reprimanded. In order to compensate Yaoniang, the consort rewarded her with two clothes again, which were better than the two before and the color was more tender. She liked it very much, and she wore it on the next day, but she pierced side consort Hu\u2019s eyes, which she regarded as thorns in her eyes\u2026Suddenly, Yaoniang didn\u2019t want to think about it anymore. Cuizhu was stupid. She was also stupid before. If she hadn\u2019t been for a lifetime, she wouldn\u2019t understand the meaning inside.Yaoniang just rummaged through the torn clothes and went back to bed.Cuizhu glanced over there proudly, and felt that this person was so coward that she was not difficult to deal with.The next day, after side consort Hu greeted with consort Jin, she brought Yaoniang and Cuizhu back to Liuchun Pavilion.Along the way, side consort Hu didn\u2019t look good. She must be bullied when she paid respects to consort Jin.After entering the hall, side consort Hu sat down in the first place, then Yaoniang and Cuizhu stood in front of her.Side consort Hu looked up and down on the two of them with her beautiful eyes.The two wet nurses looked good and were considered to have above average appearance.One of them wore a bright red shirt and had an oval face with phoenix eyes and a small mole was on the corner of her mouth. She was very charming when she smiled. She looked very restless at first glance. Her eyes flickered and her smile was very flattering.Side consort Hu saw more of these people, they would climb up desperately if there is a chance.As for the other, she had a lotus face, willow leaf eyebrows, apricot eyes and cherry lips. She was good-looking but timid. She always looked down and was coward.Wearing old autumn-colored clothes, the placket and cuffs were a little white and the clothes were too dark. The woman originally had seven-pointed beauty, and three or four points were reduced by the clothes.Side consort Hu thought: another one who doesn\u2019t know how to dress herself. Side consort Hu was beautiful and loved to dress herself. She always looked down on this kind of woman who did not know how to dress herself. Maybe it\u2019s because of shabby background that she wore such clothes.Of course, side consort Hu not only looked at these, but at their figures.Cuizhu looked too dazzling. The small waist was as slim as willow. The sweat towel around that waist couldn\u2019t be fastened much more tightly, for fear of not showing her figure. The other, however, was wearing old and loose clothes that her figure couldn\u2019t be seen clearly.It was just a face-to-face meeting. Side consort Hu also had a rough impression of these two people. Who should be paid attention to and who should be dealt with at first? It\u2019s already in her mind.In particular, the appearance of Cuizhu tended to be gorgeous and charming, but side consort Hu was also charming.Seeing side consort Hu looked back and forth on Cuizhu, she looked at her but she just skipped. Yaoniang felt relieved eventually.And all this needed to take a long time to tell, but it was just a few breaths later. Soon side consort Hu didn\u2019t look at them and said lightly: \u201cTake them to the small lateral yard.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dUntil the two turned and left, Yaoniang could feel the sight of side consort Hu looking around on their backs.She was thankful that she had made the right decision.*On the side of Siyi Yard, Hong\u2019er showed the clothes left by Yaoniang to Madam Zhou.Madam Zhou frowned and said, \u201cI wondered why the woman wear old clothes instead of new ones. It turns out that her new clothes were broken.\u201dConsort Jin was also there and looked up.Seeing this, Madam Zhou advised the details.\u201cThe one named Cuizhu belongs to Madam Cao\u2019s family?\u201dMadam Zhou nodded: \u201cCuizhu\u2019s mother worked in the village taken by consort as dowries. This woman had a bad life. Her husband died as soon as she was pregnant. So, she wanted to make a living in the mansion. I thought she\u2019s proud and pretty so I picked her. But I never thought that she was so emotional.\u201dShe frowned slightly, apparently resentful of what Cuizhu did.Because in their eyes, Cuizhu was a stupid person. Only stupid person did this kind of unpleasant things to disgust people.On the contrary, consort Jin did not take it for granted. She was meant to make troubles. It\u2019s okay as long as she made troubles to others. As for whether or not to continue to make troubles, it depended on the other party\u2019s fortune. If it was done well, she did not mind letting the other party become the second concubine Feng.From consort Jin\u2019s point of view, Cuizhu was better to order. She was stupid and unstable that would make troubles.But the other one couldn\u2019t help disappointing consort Jin\u2026However, she didn\u2019t take it seriously, but she was a servant, which was not too important for consort Jin. Even though consort was satisfied with Yaoniang yesterday, this satisfaction was like seeing a special hair clasp or a favorite cat or puppy. It\u2019s just a gadget.She just made it for fun, but she could abandon it when she didn\u2019t like it. Because there were always countless people like her.\u201cIt\u2019s OK. It\u2019s just a show. Don\u2019t be too serious.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Madam Zhou nodded and smiled, \u201cThere is no need for us to be so cautious over Liuchun Pavilion.\u201dThis was naturally ironic, but noble people had to have dignity. Didn\u2019t she say that Siyi Yard cared about the Liuchun Pavilion much? So, they always made many troubles to others? It meant that they were too narrow-minded.Every time they made troubles to Liuchun Pavilion. It was always the best time in Siyi Yard. Everyone laughed with joy, as if they had seen some farce. Consort Jin also smiled, she frowned slightly as she looked out of the window inadvertently .Suddenly she was so annoyed by herself that she seemed to live just to fight with those women?The little princess lived in a small lateral yard in Liuchun Pavilion.A small lateral yard was not worthy of the name.It is a courtyard adjacent to the Liuchun Pavilion. A corner door opened from the side can lead to the Liuchun Pavilion, and the main entrance can be freely accessed.Although the yard was not large, it looked extremely delicate. Three small, two-story buildings with pink walls and tiles, windows, and doors were all scarlet. There were two large tanks in the courtyard, with lotus leaves floating in the large tank, but it was a bowl of lotus, and it had not yet reached the blooming season. Another pink apricot tree was planted in the open space in front of the veranda, and the whole scenery was surprisingly soft.In addition to the small building, there was also a rear-covering room, and left and right compartments, which could be considered as extremely spacious.In addition to the little princess lived in this yard, there were a Mammy, two first-class maids, four second-class maids and two wet nurses, with a total of about ten people serving the little princess. Today two people, Yaoniang and Cuizhu had been added.It was just to serve a little baby. When the little princess grew older, there were more people serving.Because Yaoniang had a child of the same age, she sighed and couldn\u2019t help but made comparisons. She was also a baby, but she owed a lot to Xiaobao.Thinking of it this way, her mood inevitably dimmed.When Yaoniang and Cuizhu came to small lateral yard, they first met Mammy Mu.Mammy Mu was in charge of daily chores in the small lateral yard.Why she was called a Mammy instead of a Madam? At first, Yaoniang didn\u2019t understand it. It was only later in her last life that she knew it. The one came from the imperial palace could be called Mammy. And Mammy Mu came out of the imperial palace, and was the one Jin Wang ordered to take care of the little princess.At first, Yaoniang didn\u2019t know about this. As soon as she entered the mansion, she was bullied by Cuizhu and people in Liuchun pavilion. She couldn\u2019t take care of herself well, so she couldn\u2019t notice this kind of thing. It was later that she stayed in the mansion for a long time, only to find out that Mammy Mu, who was not so good in appearance, was so unusual.And it was precisely because of Mammy Mu\u2019s existence that even if the princess and side consort Hu fought harder, they never influenced the little princess. Until then, Yaoniang realized the real meaning, or the true intention of Jin Wang.Because of this cognition, Yaoniang was a little nervous when she saw Mammy Mu.But Mammy Mu didn\u2019t say anything to them, just took a glance at them. Then she asked people settle them down.Today, there was only one master in the small lateral yard. She\u2019s still a baby. There were not many servants, so the house was very spacious.The little princess lived in a small building. Mammy Mu, Yucui and Yuyan lived in east chamber. Wet nurses lived in the west chamber, while others were in the reversely-set house and rooms for family dependent.Yaoniang and Cuizhu were arranged in the west chamber. Each person had one room, which was no different from the last life.The room was large, at least for Yaoniang\u2019s origin. The entire room was divided into two by a black lacquered embroidered four-season flower screen. In the front was the hall, where a black lacquered eight immortal table and a stool of the same color were placed. to the window was an Arhat bed, two round chairs and long narrow tables.The bedroom was across the screen, next to the corner was a canopy bed with a painted cloud pattern. There was a gauze hung on the bed. And there was a wardrobe box, a basin and a washbasin shelf. There was a black lacquered dressing table under the window, and next to the inner corner was a screen, behind which was a commode and a bath bucket.The rich ladies also lived in such bedroom outside. But here it was for a servant. The wealth of the mansion was really astounding.However, Yaoniang didn\u2019t feel any surprise when she saw more wealth in the mansion in her last life.As soon as Yaoniang put down her small bag, Lv\u2019e knocked on the door and walked in.Lv\u2019e was the second-class maid in the small lateral yard.In addition to her, Lvchou, Lvyao and Lvluo were also the second-class maids. Yucui and Yuyan were first-class maids around little princess. They had a higher status than the other two wet nurses.The reason why the maids\u2019 identity was lower than wet nurses\u2019 was because the little princess was still young, and wet nurses had no other role than feeding, and they wasn\u2019t be educated.Lv\u2019e held a tray in her hand, and a few clothes were in the tray.Yaoniang rushed forward and Lv\u2019e said, \u201cFrom the instructions of sister Yuyan, I come here to send clothes for wet nurse Su. Just in time for the season changing, there are four sets in all.\u201d\u201cThank you. Lv\u2019e\u201d Yaoniang said.Lv\u2019e nodded and put down the clothes, then she left.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 11": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Jin Wang Dotes on His ConcubineCH 11Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayYaoniang looked at the clothes on the table and her eyes were full of joy.She was just worried about that she didn\u2019t have clothes to wear.In fact, she came out from home with only a few clothes. She used to like pink and delicate colors, but now she didn\u2019t want to be so attractive. So instead she took some dark colored clothes. The clothes sent to her were exactly all dark.One was stone blue; one was green, and the other two were bronze mist and sandalwood color. These colors were not suitable for Yaoniang\u2019s age, but for her identity. A wet nurse was in charge of feeding babies and she didn\u2019t need to wear too fancy.In the last life, Yaoniang just arrived at the small lateral yard, and she received several clothes given by the top. But she thought that the color of clothes was too ugly so she wore her own clothes. Obviously it was the same thing, but she had different state of mind. It had to let people lament the impermanence of the world.Yaoniang tried on clothes behind the folding screen. Because it was not tailor-made, it was a little bigger when she wore. But what she just wanted now was loose clothes.Yaoniang put on her new clothes and went out.First she asked a little girl where she could do a laundry. When she learned that the well in front of the room was available, she returned to take the clothes to wash.Going out from the small side door next to the small building, there was a courtyard about the same size as the front one. There was a row of rooms for family dependent on the front, and on the sides there were a utility room, a kitchen, and a few dwelling houses.There were tubs, buckets, and soaps for laundry in the utility room. These were told by Lvyao. In fact, Yaoniang knew it. It just seemed to be a little abrupt without asking.After getting what she wanted to use, Yaoniang went to the well and threw the bucket into it to fetch water. She didn\u2019t have much strength, so she could only get half bucket of water.With half bucket of water, she soaked her dirty clothes into a tub.Lvyao had been watching her silently by the side, seeing that she was really ready to do some laundry, then she left without talking.At the same time that Yaoniang was doing laundry, Cuizhu also received the clothes sent by Lv\u2019e.But she gave a rather dismissive glance and threw it to the side.The material was good, but the color was a bit plain. Although she was a widow, she didn\u2019t want to be a widow all her life.Since it was the first day they came here, Yaoniang and Cuizhu didn\u2019t need to work. There was half a day for them to settle down. However, Cuizhu was not a quiet person. So she changed her clothes and went out to talk with someone.She always had a lively temperament. She was outgoing and kindly greeted to people in the small lateral yard. Soon she became familiar with them.Yuyan reported the incident. Mammy Mu was calm and there was no expression on her face.\u201cRegardless of them, we only need to take good care of the little princess.\u201dYuyan nodded.*Yaoniang finished washing her clothes and drying them on the rope.She went back for fetching some water and wiped around her room. The room seemed to be cleaned in advance, but there was still some dust could be seen at the corners.Since Yaoniang wanted to stay in this yard, she put on a posture. Although what she was doing now seemed to have nothing to do with it, she was showing her attitude to everyone.These truths were the insights that Yaoniang knew since she had stayed in Jin Wang Mansion for a long time in her last life. She could only do these things. As for other things, it depended on whether other people give her opportunities or not.For the next few days, life in the small lateral yard was dull and boring.Compared with her last life, people in the lateral yard seemed to treat her and Cuizhu with kindness, but in fact they were full of estrangement in kindness.Although Yaoniang and Cuizhu also went to serve the little princess, they could only watch from a distance. Even there was no chance to do a favor, let alone to serve the little princess in person.Within a few days, Cuizhu became bored and began to run outside frequently.The excuse was to find her aunt, and more often she cottoned up to people in Liuchun Pavilion. But Yaoniang was still the same as usual.The weather was gradually getting hot, but it was fickle. Maybe it\u2019s sunny today, summer shirts can also be worn. It started to rain in the middle of the night, and it needed to change a jacket the next day.It rained yesterday. The sky was still gloomy in the morning, but it\u2019s sunny in the afternoon. It immediately became hot and made people panic.In the twilight, the small lateral yard was usually quiet, and at this time it was even quieter as if no one was here.There was also the benefit of not being taken into account: no one cared about what you do. Yaoniang went to the kitchen and took her dinner. Because it was so hot that she had no appetite, she put it there first and planned to take a bath.After a while she finished washing. It may be going to rain and it was very hot in the house. Yaoniang\u2019s hair was not dry and she sweated again. She came out of the house with her wet hair. It was much cooler outside than in the room. The breeze was blowing slowly and it was very comfortable.As soon as Yaoniang stood still, she heard voice from the side, then Cuizhu came out.Seeing a little sweat on her pink face, it seemed that she was too hot then went out.Recently, Cuizhu changed her personality and treated Yaoniang well. Maybe it was someone who instructed her. She was very enthusiastic to Yaoniang.The two lived next to each other, and from time to time Cuizhu also came to find Yaoniang and stayed in her house to talk with her. Yaoniang was clear, and she was very kind from her appearance. Cuizhu only thought that she was timid and she didn\u2019t think much. Occasionally she asked Yaoniang to help her wash clothes or something.However, if Yaoniang helped her, she wouldn\u2019t be unrequited. She brought a plate of pastries for Yaoniang from time to time.Cuizhu\u2019s aunt, Madam Cao, was a steward in the large kitchen, and these things were obtained from her by Cuizhu. Cuizhu often brought back some snacks for maids and madams in the lateral yard. Some of maids and madams were greedy for snacks. So Cuizhu was much more welcomed than Yaoniang in front of people in the lateral yard, and even in the Liuchun Pavilion.Everyone else saw her with a smile, but Yaoniang looked much bleak and had almost no sense of existence.Cuizhu saw that Yaoniang was standing outside the door then she walked and stood on her side.\u201cIt\u2019s too hot today.\u201d she said and holding a fan in her hands.Yaoniang said: \u201cYes, I just bathed and sweated again.\u201dCuizhu wiped her sweat and saw a white mark on her hand. She immediately lifted her palms and pulled out a sweat towel from her sleeve, then pretended to press her face. At the same time, she immediately took a glance at Yaoniang and her face was like a peeled egg. Then she shouted: \u201cOh, no. I have to wash now. It\u2019s really too hot today.\u201dShe wanted to ask Yaoniang to help her to fetch water, but now Yaoniang had already sat down on the stone platform of the veranda, and her other hand was holding her long hair. She could only shut her mouth and turned into the house.Yaoniang glanced at her back, and she looked back again.It was dark gradually. At this time, there were some mosquitoes. Yaoniang\u2019s long hair was almost dry, so she planned to return to the house for dinner.As soon as she came to the table and sat down, she heard a cry of a baby. The voice was sharp, and she became tense subconsciously.It\u2019s not scary. But as a mother, she was inherently sensitive to the crying of a baby.Yaoniang realized that the little princess was crying. Since she came to the small lateral yard, the little princess would cry every night. She held up her rice bowl and planned to fetch some water to wash and sleep after dinner.The dishes were a bit greasy. The meals of wet nurses were more plentiful than other servants, and most of them were meat. Because it can produce breast milk after eating a lot of meat. But Yaoniang was agitated and the food was a little cold, so she thought that she would feel uncomfortable after eating.She put down her chopsticks and cleared the table, and carried the bowl to the kitchen. When she returned, she brought half bucket of warm water. The hot water in the kitchen was constant, because the little princess should use all the time. There were much hot water, so servants could also use.Yaoniang wiped herself and poured water out.During the period, the little princess kept on crying even more and more sharply. Especially it blew suddenly. The sound of humming wind was against the cry of the child in the quiet night. It seemed extraordinarily gruesome.Yaoniang couldn\u2019t sit still. She could not help but went to the door and looked over to the small building.At this time, the candlelight was already lit in the small building, and people came in and out from time to time. People from Liuchun Pavilion also came and after asked the details then they left.Cuizhu stepped out of the room and leaned on the door then said to Yaoniang, \u201cIsn\u2019t that two very capable? How can\u2019t they even coax a child?\u201d She smiled and schadenfreude showed on her face obviously:The two she said refer to the wet nurses Wang and Qian who were now serving beside the little princess. The reason why Cuizhu and Yaoniang would be pushed out and no chance to take care of little princess in person was because two wet nurses who came first had great achievements. The two teamed up to run against Cuizhu and Yaoniang. Yaoniang didn\u2019t care, but Cuizhu hated them in her heart.Unfortunately, Cuizhu had no way to tackle with them. On the one hand, they had a higher qualification than her. On the other hand, the two were very dedicated to the little princess and it was almost impossible for them to make a mistake. The most important thing was that these two people were subordinated to side consort Hu. It\u2019s not worth to bother them. She could only bear them and would laugh at them only in private in front of Yaoniang.Seeing this kind of movement, Cuizhu knew that wet nurses Wang and Qian would definitely be reprimanded by side consort Hu tomorrow. Then she laughed extraordinarily brightly.However, Yaoniang was very silent and didn\u2019t know what she was thinking.Suddenly Yaoniang reached out and slammed the door then went outside.Seeing this, Cuizhu asked, \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\u201cI want to have a look.\u201d\u201cCome on. Don\u2019t get in the way. You have been there last time and don\u2019t you forget you\u2019re pushed out by them?\u201dCuizhu did not sympathize with Yaoniang, but it was a way of venting her dissatisfaction. Because she went there last time but was pushed out.For the time being, Yaoniang and she were still on the united front, which was one of the reasons why she was now treating Yaoniang with kindness.Yaoniang ignored her and walked towards the small building.\u201cYou\u2019ll be fooled!\u201d Cuizhu yelped behind.Yaoniang was thinking about her last life.In her previous life, Cuizhu was proud and not stable, but she could still stay in the lateral yard to be a wet nurse. The reason was that she made great achievements.At that time the little princess was crying, but Yaoniang didn\u2019t take it seriously. She had just left her son Xiaobao. When she heard such a cry, she couldn\u2019t help but thought of Xiaobao. After Xiaobao didn\u2019t stay with her mother, would he cry like this?So she became more and more sad. The little princess cried, and she cried too, crying from day to night.Some people said that she was unlucky. She felt very wronged and even became more sad. Originally, there were many wet nurses around the little princess, so she was excluded. But the little princess cried abnormally, and she couldn\u2019t help paying attention.After a few days of observation, she almost knew what was going on.She volunteered to solve the problem, but she was blocked out. Not only did she not see the little princess, she could not even enter the small building. She was anxious and really cared about the little princess. She couldn\u2019t bear the little princess crying all the time. So she found Cuizhu who could only talk with her and she wanted to tell the person who took care of little princess how to do through Cuizhu.Cuizhu used her method and cured the night crying disease for the little princess.However, Cuizhu did not tell others that this method was from Yaoniang. Cuizhu had a bad plan and said some bad words of her in front of the top when she was completely unprepared, that made Mammy Mu who was already very dissatisfied with her sent her back.On the contrary, Cuizhu gained power and respect in the lateral yard. The little princess couldn\u2019t live without her. Her position became more and more stable and even side consort Hu looked at her quite differently.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 12": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Jin Wang Dotes on His ConcubineCH 12Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAt that time, Yaoniang didn\u2019t understand this matter until she was kicked out from the small lateral yard. With the arrangement of consort Jin, she came to Liuchun Pavilion to be a servant. Seeing that people in the small lateral yard treated Cuizhu exceptionally differently, she suddenly realized after she figured out what happened.But it was too late. No one would believe what she said, so she could only suffer by her own and swallow the bitter pill in silence.Yaoniang had been waiting for a suitable opportunity these two days. Although it may cause the little princess to suffer more, she had no way. This was the only way that she can figure out at present to stand firm here.Only standing firm around the little princess could she save her life from being dragged into the water and see the day when she can leave Jin Wang Mansion to see her son Xiaobao. She died inexplicably in the last life and left Xiaobao in a hurry. She didn\u2019t know what could Xiaobao do after he lost his mother.Whenever she thought of all this, Yaoniang felt as if a knife was being twisted in her heart.Under these prerequisites, Yaoniang had thrown away her conscience for the first time in her lifetime, and she told herself that everything should be for her benefit first.Yaoniang came to the small building, and there were no guards outside the door.When she entered the door and walked in, she saw that it was bright in the east room. Mammy Mu stood there with a gloomy face. Yucui, Yuyan and Lv\u2019e were all anxious. Two wet nurses were sweaty and wet nurse Qian hugging the little princess was walking back and forth.The atmosphere was very depressing, which felt like a flame hidden in the air, and it may blow up at any time.She walked over and said, \u201cMay I help you?\u201dEveryone was looking at her.*Seriously, actually Yaoniang was not very beautiful, even she has a very well-behaved look.She has a small white face and two curved eyebrows blooming quietly like a lotus that is out of mud. Mostly because of her young age, she was somewhat immature and tender.It should be such a good face, but there inadvertently exudes a charming attraction from her eyebrows.This charming is obscure, and it doesn\u2019t show up at first glance. But if you look at her quietly, you can see some special things. It\u2019s as dense as a net that you can be charmed by accident.If only that was the case, it was a coincidence that she had a very good figure. Her plump figure, slim waist and a unique walking posture made people feel a little fascinating at first glance.In order to make herself unobtrusive, Yaoniang covered her good figure with fat clothes and deliberately changed her walking posture. But all these could only deceive ordinary people. For a person with discerning eyes, this kind of behavior would be mistaken as a deep thought.In particular, Mammy Mu knew everything. She knew that Cuizhu was welcomed at present, but Yaoniang had not attracted anyone\u2019s attention. It was enough for her to understand a lot of things.She looked at Yaoniang.Yaoniang was undoubtedly beautiful and pure under the light. The yellow light shone on her face, and her white skin looked like a layer of honey, giving a fragrant and delicious touch.Mammy Mu could not help frowning. She didn\u2019t really have a good impression on the two new wet nurses, because everyone in the mansion could see what they would do.Mammy Mu thought that the well water doesn\u2019t intrude into the river water. She didn\u2019t need them to do anything else but not make any troubles. But just when Mammy Mu was in the worst mood, someone came to add fuel to the flames.Yuyan and the other two had been with Mammy Mu for many years. They were servants in Zhaohui Hall before they came to the small lateral yard. When they saw Mammy Mu frowning, Yuyan stood up and said, \u201cWet nurse Su, you\u2019d better go back to the house. You can\u2019t help to do anything here.\u201dYaoniang startled a moment and said, \u201cThe little princess seems to be uncomfortable. I want to have a look\u2026\u201dThe little princess cried even worse, struggling hard in the arms of the wet nurse. This kind of crying sounded extremely uncomfortable, as if something was lying heavily on her head.Mammy Mu glared at her impetuously: \u201cWhat do you want to see? What can you see? Get out of here now!\u201dShe was born a square face with sharp edges and corners. She was originally from the imperial palace, and she had a sense of majesty different from ordinary people. She always kept a cold face, and looked particularly scary.But Yaoniang was unmoved. She tried to convince her: \u201cMy son Xiaobao is elder than the little princess. He had encountered this situation before, and there are some useful ways to cure\u2026\u201dNo one believed her, because everyone knew why the little princess was so.Night crying disease, as the name suggested, meant that the baby would cry inexplicably every day after dark.Sometimes the baby cried for an hour or two, sometimes it\u2019s intermittent, and there was more noise in the night anyway.Night crying disease couldn\u2019t be cured pathologically, and it doesn\u2019t work even if the doctor came. In fork, the baby who has this disease is called the night crying babies.If there is a child who has night crying disease in a family, they would write on a piece of paper \u201cEmperor, the Emperor of the Earth, there is a night crying baby in my family, and if the gentleman crossing the road reads this three times, the baby will sleep well all over the night.\u201d They will stick that on the street walls, and pedestrians would inevitably read it. They think this may heal night crying disease.However, this is a superstitious approach. In fact, the reason why babies cry at night is unclear. There may be too many reasons for it, which couldn\u2019t be solved by writing on paper. But as a baby who couldn\u2019t talk, he is neither ill nor hungry. Every day he is so noisy, people could only count on ghosts and gods.This was not the first time that the little princess had been crying like this. Seriously speaking, the little princess never stopped crying since she was one month old.They had tried many methods and doctors in medical institute had come. Finally it came to a very general conclusion that there was no way to cure.So everyone had a kind of cognition in mind that the little princess would naturally stop crying someday. Although it was harder for the servants to hold princess in turn, it was not a big deal for Jin Wang Mansion, not to mention two people holding in turn, ten or a hundred was not a problem.But all this was limited to talk about stratagems on paper. People who had never seen a baby crying never knew how terrible it was. She could cry so loudly that her face was flushed with redness, and she would weep with her eyes closed, and sometimes she would cry until she was faint. It could make people nervous, and even be worried about whether she was sick, or for other reasons.Especially now that babies in swaddling clothes were not easy enough to raise, and the status of the little princess was different. Mammy Mu would be like facing archenemy.In particular, Mammy Mu was under more pressure than people thought. Because side consort Hu wanted to bring princess back to her side by excuse to raise her by her own more than once.For these reasons, how could others believe that Yaoniang\u2019s fluttering words, \u201cI have a way\u201d.No one believed her.No one believed that Yaoniang in front of them had any good way. Even wet nurses Wang and Qian, the best wet nurses in Jin Zhou had nothing to do. Yaoniang was not comparable at all.Especially Mammy Mu, Yucui and Yuyan didn\u2019t believe her. Among these people, only they knew the purpose of Yaoniang coming here.But Yaoniang insisted so much that she even walked to wet nurse Wang who was walking around holding the little princess and stretched out her hand.She was very stubborn.\u201cLet me try. It doesn\u2019t hinder anything.\u201d At the same time, she turned back and looked at Mammy Mu pleadingly: \u201cIt is not good for the little princess to cry like this. She is likely to be faint.\u201d That\u2019s what Mammy Mu worried most.Mammy Mu stared at her.Wet nurse Wang also thought that Yaoniang\u2019s purpose was not simple, and she was impatient: \u201cWet nurse Su, don\u2019t make a mess. The little princess is used to be so noisy. She will be better after coaxing.\u201d\u201cLet me try.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d\u201cLet her try!\u201d Mammy Mu said hoarsely.Everyone knew that Mammy Mu was angry.Mammy Mu was really angry. Generally, she didn\u2019t get angry easily, but if she got angry\u2026Anyway, even Yucui and Yuyan had never seen Mammy Mu\u2019s angry look. Because Mammy Mu was too old and she came from the imperial palace that she experienced a lot and already became calm. But for more than a month after raising the little princess, she really loved the child in her heart. She felt that the child was pitiful and she also had the order of Jin Wang.The more she cared about the little princess, the more angry she was now.She even thought that if the wet nurse was just trying to show her off, and she would definitely change the mood of looking on coldly as a bystander before and let her go back to where she came from.She would definitely do that!Wet nurse Wang handed the little princess to Yaoniang, and she reached out her hands to take her over.The little princess was a very beautiful baby, but at this time she became a little scary. Her small face was flushed with red blood and her eyes were tightly closed. Her mouth opened to cry and the voice was a little hoarse. Her body was very tight and tense.Yaoniang touched the swaddling clothes on her body, and then probed the back of her neck with her fingers, then sighed inexplicably.Although Yaoniang just started to be a mother, she was good at taking care of babies. Zhu gave birth to three sons. Her mother was not healthy and she took care of her mother, also Ming\u2019er let alone Hong\u2019er and Xiaobao.Seriously, Yaoniang had taken care of children no less than five.So she had very rich experience in raising children, and even knew the body language of babies more than many people.The little princess was now sweating, but she was still wrapped in such a thick swaddling clothes. It\u2019s no wonder she would be uncomfortable. The baby girl couldn\u2019t speak, and her only expression was crying, not to mention that she was uncomfortable, and being treated like this was naturally more serious.She hugged the little princess and came to the side of Arhat bed (Arhats are monks who have reached Nirvana), and wanted to untie her swaddling clothes.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Wet nurse Qian ran over and grabbed Yaoniang\u2019s hand.\u201cThe little princess is sweaty, and I let her cool off.\u201dYaoniang didn\u2019t find it strange about what she said. But others thought it\u2019s very harsh. Especially wet nurse Wang and Qian couldn\u2019t agree with her, and even showed their contempt imperceptibly.\u201cSuch young baby couldn\u2019t stay in wind and she will catch cold.\u201d Wet nurse Wang said with a condescending attitude, as if Yaoniang didn\u2019t understand anything but she had to pretend to understand.Yaoniang ignored her and still untied the swaddling clothes.Wet nurse Wang\u2019s face turned red, and she felt a sense of contempt. Wet nurse Qian even looked at Mammy Mu, Yucui and Yuyan for help.They had spent a long time in the small lateral yard, and naturally understood who made decisions here.Jin Wang is coming in the next chapter.Please follow my wordpress and give a high rating on NU.

    "Chapter 13": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Jin Wang Dotes on His ConcubineCH 13Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIn comparison, Yaoniang seemed to be more calm.She didn\u2019t even look at the two wet nurses, instead she focused on the little princess and said: \u201cThe little baby is also a human, and an adult will be uncomfortable with sweat. Isn\u2019t the little princess uncomfortable? Although I am young and only have one child, I took care of my five nephews before.\u201dMammy Mu stared at her without speaking anything.Since Mammy Mu did not speak, Yucui and Yuyan naturally did not speak. Seeing this, wet nurse Wang and Qian could only stop speaking with disappointment.Yaoniang untied the swaddling clothes of the little princess, and found that she also wore a thick coat and cotton pants inside. Seeing this, she sighed: \u201cIn fact, babies are not afraid of cold. Just like normal people, as long as they are not sick and have no pain, there is no need to wear too many clothes. It\u2019s so hot today. We are sweating in single clothes, not to mention the little princess wearing a cotton-padded jacket\u2026\u201d\u201cWho can help me to fetch a pot of hot water?\u201dEveryone was shocked when hearing what she said. Some people could not react at this moment. Lvyao said immediately: \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201dAnd Yaoniang had taken off the thick cotton jacket and trousers on the little princess.There was also a thin layer of cotton clothes inside. Yaoniang was speechless and didn\u2019t know what to say. She even suspected that the little princess might be sick because of wearing too much instead of the reason she thought.\u201cThe little princess\u2019 clothes also need to be changed, because they are all sweaty.\u201dBecause Mammy Mu didn\u2019t speak, Yaoniang directly ordered everyone here. Soon, they didn\u2019t only fetch hot water, but also took the dry clothes of the little princess.The little princess was not crying so badly than before, but still sobbed intermittently. While taking off her clothes, Yaoniang coaxed her softly. Then she took a cloth ribbon to tie a beautiful knot and put it on her little palm. She stopped crying and tilted her head to look at the red ribbon in her hand.The little princess was naked. Her fat body was chubby, and her little arms and legs looked like lotus rhizome node. There were just some red dots on the body, which seemed that she got heat rashes.\u201cThat\u2019s because she wore too much. Adults will be uncomfortable when they get heat rashes, let alone a little baby.\u201dSeeing the little red dots on the princess\u2019 body, Mammy Mu looked at wet nurse Wang and Qian with her sharp old eyes. Although she didn\u2019t say a word, there was a lot of pressure invisibly.Wet nurse Qian was panicked, but wet nurse Wang was calmer than her and said gloomily, \u201cThe little princess is still too young, and I dare not take a shower for her. We used watermelon juice to help her wash the heat rashes. All heat rashes had been wiped away before. But we don\u2019t know she gets this again. When we scrubbed for her at noon, she didn\u2019t get red rashes. Yuyan was also there. Yuyan, the princess didn\u2019t get heat rashes at that time, right?\u201dYuyan hesitated and nodded.Mammy Mu didn\u2019t speak anymore. Yaoniang didn\u2019t say anything either. It must have been an opportunity to bully others, but she didn\u2019t seem to understand at all. She just wiped the little princess with a wet towel quietly and carefully.Her movements were gentle and familiar, and she seemed to be accustomed to these things at first glance. To this day, everyone knew that wet nurse Su didn\u2019t want to show herself off, but she really has a remarkable skill.In addition the little princess did not cry at this moment, everyone was a little more convinced.Yucui stepped forward to help Yaoniang, and Yaoniang didn\u2019t refused. She asked Yucui to help the princess to wear clothes. She put the towel in the basin and wrung it, then she lifted princess\u2019 legs gently and wiped her little butt.Yaoniang frowned when she saw the redness around the butt, and she couldn\u2019t help but frowned, \u201cWhat happened?\u201dShe didn\u2019t mean to blame, but just to express the facts. But the two wet nurses who had just experienced previous things thought she undoubtedly picked on them.Wet nurse Qian was extremely righteous and refuting: \u201cIt is normal to be red for the baby in this age.\u201dYaoniang simply wondered where the two wet nurses came from. But after thinking for a while, they were not very old and probably only had one or two children. So how could they understand these things?She didn\u2019t say anything, but asked Lv\u2019e to find some sesame oil.Lv\u2019e was in a daze and she didn\u2019t know why Yaoniang needed sesame oil at the moment. Then she looked at Mammy Mu.Mammy Mu took a meaningful look at Yaoniang and nodded her head.Soon, Lv\u2019e came with a bowl of sesame oil. There was a small kitchen in the small lateral yard. So this kind of thing was not lacking.Yaoniang didn\u2019t expect that she would get so much, then she couldn\u2019t help but said, \u201cIn fact, a little bit is enough.\u201dShe dipped a little with her fingertips and applied it to the red areas around the butt, then put on her underpants and diapers.At this time, the little princess seemed to be more comfortable, and her big eyes blinked at Yaoniang, revealing an innocent smile.Yaoniang not only became tender, but her heart seemed to have melted.At this moment, she thought of Xiaobao, and felt a sadness in her heart. However, she was not immersed in this sadness, and she reached out her hands to touch the little princess\u2019 belly.In fact, when she just wiped for the little princess, Yaoniang felt that the princess had abdominal distension. But she was not sure. She touched it at this time and tapped under everyone\u2019s frightened sights. She already knew something.\u201cDoes the little princess fart much in these two days?\u201dAfter hearing this, wet nurse Wang looked at wet nurse Qian, and wet nurse Qian looked at wet nurse Wang again. The two looked at each other. Apparently, even they did not deliberately observe this thing.Yaoniang couldn\u2019t help but sighed in her heart again, and said, \u201cThe baby in this age is easy to get abdominal distension, which will make them feel uncomfortable. So they will not stop crying.\u201dAt this moment, wet nurse Qian finally found excuses that could refute the other party.She disagreed very much and said: \u201cIs wet nurse Su questioning the judgement of sister Wang and me? We two avoid certain food according with the rules. It\u2019s normal for the little princess to fart and she didn\u2019t have abdominal distension as you said. If she has abdominal distension, how can she fart?\u201dYaoniang didn\u2019t know how to explain it. She had come up with this judgment on her own.At that time, Zhu gave birth to Dong\u2019er, who also cried every night. Family members were utterly routed and couldn\u2019t sleep all night.Her mother was so anxious that she asked babies\u2019 situation from other people whether this was the case. Many people\u2019s babies was the case after asking and even someone gave her mother a lot of folk prescriptions. They tired all means but it had no effect at all finally. Then they returned to the old way, embracing him in the arms to coax.In fact, she was holding him alone. Her mother was not in good health. Zhu was lazy and bad. She didn\u2019t worry about Dong\u2019er at all. After learning that many people\u2019s babies faced such situation, and they would be fine in a certain month, she just leave Dong\u2019er alone and didn\u2019t care about this. She hugged Dong\u2019er all night long, and sometimes she could fall asleep with the baby in her arms.Later, she couldn\u2019t bear anymore. So she figured out a solution on her own.After several days of observation, she came to a conclusion that it was probably caused by abdominal distension.She tempted slowly and carefully verified, then worked out a unique method. Although it may not be cured, it could be greatly relieved. Later, Yaoniang tried on two other nephews, and it turned out to be effective.After that, her elder sister\u2019s son, Hong\u2019er and Ming\u2019er, even Xiaobao, never had a night crying disease.Wet nurse Qian was very proud to see that Yaoniang finally didn\u2019t say a word. But Yaoniang didn\u2019t see her. She dipped some sesame oil with her fingertips and rubbed it hard in her hands until her hands were heated. Then she covered her hands on the princess\u2019 abdomen and massage her gently.\u201cYou can\u2019t massage her. The little princess is just a baby.\u201d Wet nurse Qian rushed to grab her hand.Her movements were too abrupt, and her voice was sharp and thin. The little princess who was not crying started to cry again. Yaoniang felt painful because wet nurse Qian grabbed her heavily, which caused her pain.Wet nurse Wang hugged the little princess quickly to get her far away, which looked like she was afraid of the princess being robbed by Yaoniang.\u201cMammy, Please think about it. Do you believe her or us? She is just a baby and her bones haven\u2019t grown up. She couldn\u2019t be massaged in such way.\u201dFor a while, Mammy Mu also hesitated and she didn\u2019t know who she should believe.\u201cLet her do!\u201dA low, but very magnetic male voice suddenly sounded outside the door, and everyone couldn\u2019t help but looked away.However, they didn\u2019t know when Jin Wang came.Jin Wang stood there silently, who seemed to have been there for a while, followed by the chief eunuch Fucheng in the Jin Wang Mansion.There was only one dimly lamp in the hall. Jin Wang was in a dark purple uniform with patterned cuffs and lappets. A jade belt was around his waist. His complexion was clear as jade as he stood in that dark room.There is always a kind of person who just stands quietly can catch everyone\u2019s sights.Jin Wang is one of them.He is tall and straight with noble temperament. His skin is as white as the finest white tallow jade. He has a tall nose and thin lips. Above are arched eyebrows and a pair of long and narrow slanted eyes that not easily reveal what he is thinking.There is no doubt that Jin Wang is handsome.Because he is so handsome enough to the degree of beauty, Jin Wang has a sturdy figure with an elegant temperament.But if you know his past, you will think that he is deceiving the world. In fact, Jin Wang\u2019s reputation outside is not good.People say he is very killing and grumpy.In folk, his name has the effect of stopping children crying.There is a rumor in the world that Jin Wang has no children until now because he killed too much. It is even rumored that Jin Wang doesn\u2019t like women but only men\u2026There are many rumors about Jin Wang. Yaoniang is not clear about other rumors. But as for he doesn\u2019t like women but men, she has a right to explain.Because she had seen his most inelegant look\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 14": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Jin Wang Dotes on His ConcubineCH 14Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayYaoniang\u2019s heart was beating so hard, bang bang bang\u2026The palms of her hands were sweaty.Jin Wang was not in the Mansion recently. Why did he suddenly appear here?With the sound of heartbeat, she seemed to have reached a void world. She could see nothing and only felt the hot male body behind her and the sound of breathlessness in her ear\u2026Yaoniang suddenly became agitated, and she was sober immediately. The situation in the room was also reflected in her eyes. Except Mammy Mu, everyone was on their knees, but only she stood there silently.On the opposite side, Jin Wang looked at her inexplicably.Yaoniang had a creepy feeling, and immediately her legs softened and she knelt on the ground.Jin Wang looked around people. When he saw the little princess in the arms of the wet nurse Wang, his eyes softened for a moment. He lifted his hands up and walked in, \u201cEveryone gets up.\u201dHe sat down in a round chair next to him: \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me. Please go on. The little princess is the most important.\u201dLv\u2019e and other people went out, and then offered tea to Jin Wang not before long. They didn\u2019t come in, but stood outside the door. The lights in the hall were also lit very brightly.Yaoniang bowed her head and was absent-minded, not knowing what she was thinking. She didn\u2019t react until Yucui called her.\u201cWet nurse Su, Jin Wang asked you to continue.\u201d\u201cOK.\u201dYaoniang turned around and took a few deep breaths to stabilize her mind.To cover the tension in her heart, she reached out her hands and dipped sesame oil with fingertips in the bowl and rubbed it in her palms. It took a long time for her to slightly and gently massage the little princess\u2019s abdomen again and again.Because her action was really astonishing, everyone couldn\u2019t help staring at her hand, for fearing that she massaged so hard with her hands so that there would be an accident happening to the little princess. No one thought that the little princess seemed to be fine, although she moved her body uncomfortably, but did not cry.Now Yaoniang was relying on her perseverance.She tried to ignore the gaze behind her, massaging the abdomen of the little princess according to the method in memory, and helping her to fold her legs. A few times on the left, a few times on the right, and then the two fat legs were lifted up on the abdomen. She pressed them and held for a few breaths, and then put them down.This action was too scary. Wet nurse Wang and Qian wanted to stop her. But because Jin Wang was here, they did not dare to speak.It was very quiet in the room that Yaoniang could even hear her breathing. She could feel a gaze thrown on her spine, making her nervous while a familiar numbness rolled up from the tailbone.Fortunately, the gaze quickly shifted away so that Yaoniang could massage for princess calmly. By this time she was sweating and out of breath.Yaoniang did not dare to turn around, and gently helped the little princess to put on the jacket.\u201cAlright?\u201d Mammy Mu asked over.At this moment, there were a few indecent sounds, but Yaoniang sighed a relief as if a weight had been lifted from her shoulder.She didn\u2019t answer Mammy Mu and opened the little princess\u2019s diaper for a look.The little princess just farted.\u201cThis can only be temporarily relieved. We need to wait and see if there are any effect. In addition, we need to massage for her everyday and do it a few more days that will have good effects\u2026\u201dAt this moment, a series of rapid footsteps sounded loudly, and then a group of people stepped in.Side consort Hu brought some people over.With a surprising look on her face, she said \u201cWangye, when did you come back?\u201d Then she stepped up to look at the little princess with anxiety: \u201cHow about the princess? All of you are too incapable to take good care of a child. I could hear the crying of princess when I am in Liuchun Pavilion\u2026 My poor girl, I am really worried about you\u2026\u201dShe changed her expression extremely quickly. Facing Yaoniang and other people, she was so angry. But when she faced Jin Wang, she became so tender and pathetic.Yaoniang sighed in her heart. No wonder that when she died in her last life, side consort Hu was still alive.This is the ability!Thinking about how she got along with Jin Wang in last life, she never talked much with him. People in Jin Wang Mansion rumored that she was doted, but only Yaoniang knew what the truth was. She dare bully side consort Hu in Siyi Yard because consort Jin was supporting her. If she could only rely on herself, she would never want to take revenge even though side consort Hu humiliated her.She didn\u2019t want to take revenge, and she dare not, either.Because Yaoniang knew the special significance of side consort Hu to Jin Wang, not to mention that side consort Hu gave birth to the little princess.Princess was the only child of Jin Wang, so he treated her differently.On the other side, side consort Hu gazed at Jin Wang tenderly: \u201cWangye, can I take princess back to Liuchun Pavilion so that I take care of her in person? Even if it will be hard for me, I have to take care of her. The little princess must miss her mother, and all children want to be close to their mothers. Your Highness, would you agree with me?\u201dAny man in the world can not help but be moved by such a gorgeous and lovely beauty. But Jin Wang was like a stone man, let alone his face hadn\u2019t changed and his eyes did not move.His Highness was too lazy to speak, and Fucheng, the eunuch closed to him, naturally helped Jin Wang to talk first.He was half-bent over and said respectfully: \u201cDon\u2019t worry, side consort. The little princess is fine now. Look at her. Isn\u2019t she good?\u201dThe little princess was sucking her thumbs in peace in Yaoniang\u2019s arms, who looked very cute.\u201cShe is OK now?\u201dSide consort Hu\u2019s red lips were half open, and she seemed to be unable to react.There was a slight ripple in Fucheng\u2019s eyes. With a smile on his face, he said: \u201cYeah, she\u2019s fine.\u201dHe looked at side consort Hu, who wore a rouge red skirt with cloud and mist and a coat with the same color. She seemed like wearing a pyjama in a hurry, but in fact, she was deliberately dressed. There was a bun and a gold hair pin with gold lace inlaid pink tourmaline peony flower on her head. A few flowers were also inserted next to the sideburns and her red lips were painted with rouge.Who would dress like this when sleeping?However, Fucheng was an eunuch who hadn\u2019t carefully looked at a woman to sleep. He only intuitively judged that side consort Hu had learned that Jin Wang had come down, so she hurried over.Fucheng could see all clearly. How could Jin Wang not know?The expression on his face was not obvious: \u201cI think that Mammy Mu can take good care of Anrong here.\u201d\u201cThis is my duty.\u201d Mammy Mu said with respect.Jin Wang nodded and stood up, then he stepped outside the door.Side consort Hu stunned for a moment. She looked at the little princess who was held in Yaoniang\u2019s arms, and saw the back of Jin Wang. She gritted her teeth and chased out.The room suddenly became empty, and Yaoniang finally relieved.Crystal sweat dripped down her forehead, and fell on her eyelashes. She wanted to blink her eyes but she didn\u2019t dare. She wanted to wipe sweat out but she was holding the princess. She looked a little embarrassed.Yaoniang was sweating all over.Mammy Mu looked at the obedient Yaoniang and glanced at the sweaty place on her chest. Then she signaled Yucui to take over the little princess and said: \u201cYou go back and wash yourself first. You can stay here to look after the princess tonight.\u201dYaoniang stunned. Did she allow her to serve the little princess?At the same time, she also noticed Mammy Mu\u2019s eyes, which immediately made her face turn red.Today she wore a turquoise summer shirt. The clothes of this kind of material would be a little transparent when it dipped in water.The thin material stuck to the skin due to the erosion of sweat. The dark color made the skin under become more prominent. Underneath the gorgeous red was towering white\u2026Yaoniang thought that Jin Wang had just stared at her, and couldn\u2019t help wondering if he had also seen this scene, then her face seemed to be burning, and she felt very embarrassed.She remembered Jin Wang said in her last life that she was a little fairy who always liked to seduce him.That was the most ashamed thing he had ever told her.Only once did she remember it freshly.Did he think that she was indiscreet and deliberately let him see? Did he think she was trying to seduce him? Too late to think about it. Yaoniang nodded twice in a hurry, not even daring to lift her head, and ran away covering her chest.Mammy Mu originally had a gloomy look, and shook her head with a smile when she saw this. She felt that she had been in the imperial palace for a long time, and it seemed like everyone was cunning.According to current observations, wet nurse Su didn\u2019t look like a deliberate person.But when thinking of consort Jin, Mammy Mu was not sure about this idea. But for her, as long as side consort could give birth to Jin Wang\u2019s kids, she had nothing to worry about whether side consort was deliberate or not.Consort De died early, so Jin Wang was raised up by Mammy Mu from a young age. In her opinion, she never paid attention to how the process was, only caring about the results. This was the reason why Mammy Mu was willing to respect side consort Hu, but she didn\u2019t respect consort Jin.A woman who couldn\u2019t give birth a child is useless even she is the consort. In the mind of Mammy Mu, she was deeply entrenched in thinking that children was the most important for women.Yaoniang hurriedly walked to her house, and stopped at the door.Cuizhu stood in front of her room door, apparently she also heard the movement before and knew that Jin Wang was there.Under the dim light, Cuizhu bit his lower lip. She was jealous and envious to look at Yaoniang with some complexities.\u201cI really have looked down on you.\u201d The voice burst from her throat and dried up terribly.Yaoniang looked at her, pretending to be puzzled: \u201cCuizhu, what did you say?\u201d There was a bitter smile in her heart. If she knew that Jin Wang would return tonight, she would definitely not go there today.Cuizhu\u2019s eyes turned around with a sigh of disdain, then she turned into the room and slammed the door.The action was so hard that the door frame almost fell down.In the darkness, Yaoniang stood outside for a while before pushing the door into the house.She was going to get some hot water. Before she could go, a rough woman came over with two buckets of hot water. Yaoniang wanted to take it over, but she didn\u2019t let them go. She smiled and poured the water into the bath tub for her, and said that there were much hot water if it wasn\u2019t enough for her.In fact, people were so realistic. You didn\u2019t need to do anything. As long as the top treated you differently, it would be enough for the people below to change their attitudes.It was like consort Jin treating Yaoniang in last life and Mammy Mu to her in this life.The little princess was still a non-talking baby. Mammy Mu was the weathervane in this small lateral yard. Jin Wang had just left, and everyone knew it. Wet nurse Su made achievements in front of Jin Wang and Mammy Mu allowed her to serve the little princess.It needn\u2019t to say the meaning behind.In fact, everyone was actually measuring.Mammy Mu was old, and she was impossible to be the wet nurse of the little princess. There was no doubt that the wet nurse of the little princess would be chosen from these wet nurses. Wet nurse Wang and Qian seemed to be on the united front, but in fact they competed with each other. Now, Yaoniang and Cuizhu were not counted. Yaoniang stood out unexpectedly today and made such a great achievement. As long as she could cure the night crying disease for the little princess, everyone in the small lateral yard must respect her.With these, she needn\u2019t worry that she would have no rights beside the little princess.In the bath tub, Yaoniang immersed herself in hot water and emptied her mind.She seemed to think a lot, but actually she didn\u2019t think about anything.Anxiety, uneasiness, restlessness, cramping, worry had long since faded away, leaving only a full amount of melancholy.Why was she melancholy? She didn\u2019t know either.She remembered side consort Hu who chased after Jin Wang, and suddenly immersed her whole body in hot water.Sorry to update late today.

    "Chapter 15": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Jin Wang Dotes on His ConcubineCH 15Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe sudden return of Jin Wang made the whole mansion lively.At the same time, it was ablaze with lights in the Liuchun Pavilion. The lights of Siyi Yard, Qixia Pavilion and Tingxue Pavilion all turned on. Until Jin Wang returned to Zhaohui Hall, it was quiet in the entire back yard again.In the Liuchun Pavilion, side consort Hu drew the hair pin out of her head and threw it on the ground. She wanted Jin Wang to stay in Liuchun Pavilion, but he ignored her and left away.Although Jin Wang is hard-hearted, he rarely does not respect side consort Hu.It is obvious that Jin Wang must be angry.Taohong walked over to pick up the hair pin, and came to side consort Hu\u2019s side to persuade her: \u201cNiangniang, Your Highness has just returned from the outside. He is travel-worn and weary. He must have a good rest first.\u201dSide consort Hu gritted her teeth and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s the gatekeeper\u2019s purpose? Even they didn\u2019t know to send a message when Wangye came back, which caused me to rush over there. My Highness cared much about the little princess and he must have thought that I am not responsible to be a mother.\u201dIn fact, side consort Hu also felt that she was very wronged. She certainly wants to keep her baby around. But the bitch consort Jin is so cruel that she made Your Highness misunderstand her and let the little princess live alone.It seems that the little princess is still staying in Liuchun Pavilion, but it is clear that everyone knows what is going on. Side consort Hu is doted by Jin Wang too much. Everyone knows that Wangye is still wise and martial, and he is not crazy about women.Side consort Hu is very annoyed, wishing to eat consort Jin alive so as to release her anger in her heart.\u201cIt\u2019s not once or twice that princess cries at night. The doctors of the medical institute saw princess before, which is known by all people in the Mansion. How could Wangye be angry with side consort?\u201d Taohong said.\u201cBut don\u2019t forget. That bitch is good at making troubles and stabbing a person in the back. That wet nurse was brought in by her and I still don\u2019t know how she would show off her contributions in front of Wangye and by the way saying some bad words of me. I still want to take the princess back\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, no!\u201d side consort Hu walked a few steps back and forth, making up her mind, \u201cWhat is the name of the wet nurse just now? I will give a big reward to her. In addition, Please ask someone to pay attention to the one named Cuizhu. Look for a chance to kick her out of the mansion. Wangye is back now. Do it quickly so as not to cause any troubles.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d*Yaoniang took a shower quickly and then went to the small building with wet hair.The wind stops blowing, but it starts to rain again. The rain is not heavy, and a few drops of rain fall audibly. Finally it is not too hot.Yaoniang walked down the veranda and entered the small building along the way. The little princess has fallen asleep, and wet nurse Qian and Mammy Mu are still on the sidelines.The cradle with padauk carving of \u201cFu Shou Lu\u201d is put in front of the Alcove bed, with a layer Yudi bed-curtain. The style of this bedroom is as the same as Jin Wang Mansion, luxurious and yet understated.The little princess doesn\u2019t seem to sleep well. After Yaoniang greeted to Mammy Mu, she heard the sound of princess moving in the cradle. It\u2019s the kind of sound that occurred in the nasal cavity. It\u2019s snoring. The sound is very low, but she is not awake.Yaoniang knows that this is a sign of not falling asleep deeply, and she is probably a little uncomfortable.She walked over and saw that the little princess in the cradle is wrapped in a layer of swaddling clothes and she couldn\u2019t help sighing and lowering her voice: \u201cThe little princess would be uncomfortable as she is wrapped.\u201dShe was wrapped by wet nurse Qian. All babies from the entire Qian Dynasty were wrapped in swaddling clothes. They were wrapped in swaddle from a young age so that their arms and legs would be straight. Why did wet nurse Su always pick on her?Wet nurse Qian not only thought that Yaoniang was picking on her, but also that she was targeting herself. She didn\u2019t forget how she and wet nurse Wang had bullied her before.But this is an indestructible knot. The little princess is alone, but there are four wet nurses around. As the little princess are growing up, there would be fewer wet nurses around her. And in the end, there will be only one person left as Mammy. So instead of letting the other party stand firm then deal with it, it is better to start earlier and run the other party into a stand.\u201cAll babies grow up this way. But it seems that wet nurse Su thinks we deliberately don\u2019t treat the princess well?\u201d Wet nurse Qian truthfully said what she thought in her mind, and she felt aggrieved, looking at Mammy Yu and said, \u201cMammy, I have been taking after little princess for many days. The princess was very good before. Even the consort and side consort Hu praised sister Wang and me for taking good care of the princess that she is fat and strong. As for night crying disease, every baby has such disease for a while. Wet nurse Su is really capable to ease the crying of the little princess. But it is not clear to say this kind of thing. It can\u2019t overrule sister Wang\u2019s and my hard work only judging from this point.\u201dIt seems that she talked too much. But there are only two meanings: one is to say that Yaoniang made a great achievement by accident. The other is that she complained to Mammy Mu for grievances, and retreated by the way in order to advance to fight against Yaoniang.If in Yaoniang\u2019s last life, she would have been so panicked now that she doesn\u2019t know what to do. Only what she would do is to explain that she doesn\u2019t have this kind of thoughts. She lives once more lifetime than others, so she becomes calmer than before.The most important thing is that Yaoniang believes that Mammy Mu has her own judgment.In terms of taking 10,000 steps back, the little princess cries at night no more than one or two days. Why couldn\u2019t they try other methods?Yaoniang also said what she wanted to say. Compared with wet nurse Qian who pretended to be wronged, obviously, Yaoniang\u2019s gentle attitude was more admired by Mammy Mu. However, Mammy Mu still didn\u2019t forget the hard works of the wet nurses before. After all, preconceived ideas couldn\u2019t be avoided.\u201cJust try as wet nurse Su said, and it won\u2019t hurt anything. both Wang and I know you and wet nurse Wang\u2019s love and concern for the little princess, we will not let your hard work go to waste. You and wet nurse Wang have also worked hard recently. You can\u2019t sleep at night and have to look after the princess during the day. You can go back for a rest tonight and come back tomorrow.\u201dAfter Mammy Mu soothed her, Yucui sent wet nurse Qian who still had some grievances away. Mammy Mu took a glance at Yaoniang. Even if she didn\u2019t speak, Yaoniang understood her meaning.Yaoniang nodded and reached into the cradle to untie the swaddling on the little princess.She moved very gently, and after she untied the swaddling clothes, she gently massaged princess\u2019 hands and feet. Maybe she was gentle, or the princess really didn\u2019t like the swaddling clothes, she didn\u2019t wake up but fell asleep after moving twice. This time she slept very sweetly, and never made the sound of sleeplessness before.The little princess is also tired. After all, crying also consumes physical energy of a baby.Seeing this, Mammy Mu finally breathed a sigh of relief and went to the next chair to sit down.She\u2019s getting old and has been straining her nerves, and now she could finally take a breath. She sat there with her eyes narrowed, and it is quiet in the room, even the needle falling on the floor is audible. Yaoniang glanced at her quietly, and did not speak, but sat down on the pedal. She looked at the little princess quietly. Yucui went to make a cup of tea for Mammy Mu. Mammy Mu took the tea and sipped once. She was about to stand up to say something as Yuyan came in from outside and said something near her ear.Mammy Mu glanced at Yucui and left with Yuyan.There were only two people left in the room, Yaoniang and Yucui.Yucui whispered: \u201cToday, I stay here with wet nurse Su. You can go to bed first. If the little princess is hugry to wake up, I will call you.\u201dShe pointed to the bed under the south window, and there is a set of blanket on it. Apparently someone had prepared it in advance. There is a bed in the room, but this bed is not intended to set for servants.Yaoniang said: \u201cYou have worked hard in the day. You can sleep first. I\u2019m not sleepy.\u201dSeeing Yucui not moving, she smiled softly: \u201cSince I came here, I eat and do not work every day. I always feel very uneasy. Now that I have something to do, so it is time to do my best. Look at my wet hair. I can\u2019t sleep now. Besides, I don\u2019t know if the princess will wake up in the middle of the night. Please go to bed first, Yucui.\u201dYucui said nothing and went to lay down on the bed.Not to mention, she is really tired these days.*The waning moon is like a hook, and it is still raining at night.Jin Wang Mansion under the night is like a sleeping beast, quiet but full of majesty.The rules of the Jin Wang Mansion are very strict. After lighting the lamp, no one is allowed to wander in the mansion if nothing happens.Zhaohui Hall is located at the central axis of Jin Wang Mansion. With it as a boundary, the entire Jin Wang Mansion is divided into two parts. The front is the forecourt of the mansion, which is divided into middle, east, and west roads. The middle road is the hub for Jin Wang to deal with fiefdoms affairs, and the banquets are held here, too. The east and west roads are the places that gatekeepers, staff, myrmidons, guards, as well as Changshi Department, the horse horse Department, the clerical Department and so on.Zhaohui Hall is connected with the front yard and back houses. It is the place where Jin Wang lives.Speaking of Zhaohui Hall, it covers a very large area. Different from the beautiful and elegant style of the back yard, it looks like a magnificent royal style. It is guarded heavily and guards from Jin Wang Mansion patrol this place day and night.Mammy Mu and a group of people came here, and someone had already stood outside the door.Entering through the side door, they walked to the bedroom. As soon as she arrived in front of the door, several eunuchs greeted her and helped her go inside.Jin Wang took a shower first after he returned to Zhaohui Hall. He just came out of the bath room.He only wears a black robe and walked out of it barefoot. The bright gold brick floor is covered with a deep purple soft blanket. Jin Wang\u2019s shirt is half-open, exposing a smooth and sturdy chest, and ink-like long hair is scattered wetly on the shoulders and chest. Water is still dropping down from his hair.The rich black is lined with dazzling white, and Jin Wang\u2019s skin is like the first-class white tallow jade without losing the sense of strength that a man should have.When he came to the bed and sat down at will, a little eunuch stepped on his knees and wiped his feet.\u201cHave a sit, Mammy.\u201d Jin Wang said.With his voice, an eunuch moved a chair over, and Mammy Mu did not refuse to sit on it.Fucheng brought a cotton pad to wipe Jin Wang\u2019s hair and rubbed it twice. Jin Wang was annoyed and waved his hand to let him back away.Mammy Mu looked at his little master. Although he had grown up, he still did not change his previous character. Jin Wang, who was a child, didn\u2019t like others to wipe his hair or touch his head.\u201cIf you get a cold, it\u2019s not good.\u201d Mammy Mu smiled and said.Although Jin Wang was still indifferent, his facial expressions became softer, \u201cSorry for troubling you.\u201dThe sentence had double meaning. That is to express his concerns and also thanks to Mammy Mu who had been in an old age helping Jin Wang to take care of the little princess.Mammy Mu is no longer young and she is more than sixty years old now. When Jin Wang was out of the capital that year, she followed him. He wanted her to enjoy her later years. But things didn\u2019t go according to the plan. Jin Wang had no time to manage the back yard. He could only ask Mammy Mu to help.Mammy Mu has been in the imperial palace for many years, but it is just a backyard of the mansion. For her, those monsters and ghosts in the back yard could not escape. Jin Wang doesn\u2019t need her to do anything, as long as she could take good care of the little princess. As for other people, no matter how they compete with each other, he doesn\u2019t care.There are rumors outside that Jin Wang killed too many people which makes him doesn\u2019t have a son since he is 26 years old now. It is also rumored that Jin Wang has some problems which make him be unable to give birth to a son.Although Jin Wang ignores rumors on the surface, he still cares a bit. He doesn\u2019t care about that he killed too much. Because he should do his duty to guard his fiefs. But as for there are something wrong with his body, few men would probably not care about it.Especially\u2013Mammy Mu patted her legs and smiled, \u201cIt\u2019s OK. Although I am old, but I can still play a role.\u201d\u201cDo you still have the leg problem? I patrolled fiefdoms this time and found a doctor in the countryside. He is very good at curing rheumatism. This time I bring him back, and I will ask him to see you tomorrow.\u201dMammy Mu said, \u201cSorry for troubling Wangye.\u201d Then she paused for a while, and said again, \u201cI am old and it\u2019s not important whether I can be cured. Anyway, I have rheumatism many years. Male offspring is the most important for Wangye. After all, it is not enough to have a little princess, and Wangye still lacks a little boy.\u201dWhen mentioning this, Jin Wang\u2019s face stiffened a little.Other people naturally couldn\u2019t find any clue, but Mammy Mu couldn\u2019t miss anything since she raised Jin Wang when he was a young boy.She was obviously a bit misunderstood and sighed, \u201cSince that person can still please Wangye, why do you care if she is good or not? You also needs to change your personality. Women are just a tool for giving birth to children for you. It doesn\u2019t matter whether they\u2019re good or not.\u201dMammy Mu misunderstood.The original text is getting more and more difficult to be translated. I have to admit that with my limited time and poor Chinese-English translation level, I have to find an editor for this book.

    "Chapter 16": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Jin Wang Dotes on His ConcubineCH 16Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayJin Wang did not speak.Mammy Mu would not continue to say more. After all, she is a servant. Although she could say a few more words based on the previous relationship with Jin Wang, too much improper words would kill the affection of the past.She also knew in her mind that her young master knows very well in his heart. If he wasn\u2019t thoughtful, he would not become a seignior after fighting against people in imperial palace without the protection of her mother.Afterwards, the two talked for a while about something that happened in the backyard while Jin Wang was not in the mansion. Actually, they mainly talked about the little princess, side consort Hu, and even consort Jin. After all, the reason why Jin Wang originally made the little princess depart from Liuchun Pavilion was largely because side consort Hu used her daughter as an excuse that she wanted Jin Wang to dote on her and repeatedly fought with consort Jin in Siyi Yard.It was late. Jin Wang personally sent Mammy Mu out. Mammy Mu returned to the small lateral yard silently under the darkness of the night. Everything was as usual.Jin Wang returned to the inner hall. He was used to be alone and he just let Fucheng follow in.Fucheng is in his thirties. His face is milk-white without beard and he wears a dark green robe with round collar. He, regarded as one of Jin Wang\u2019s top confidants has served Jin Wang for many years. Because he served Jin Wang from childhood, naturally Jin Wang has some different feelings with him from others. Therefore, he also dares to speak more things to Jin Wang.He realized that Jin Wang was convinced by Mammy Mu. He hesitated for a moment and said to Jin Wang, \u201cWangye, I think what Mammy Mu said is right, and there should be a little master in the mansion.\u201dBut he only said this. Those who serve around the masters for many years all understand that \u201ca little wind kindles, much puts out the fire\u201d. After all, the master is the master, while he is just a servant. In particular, this matter interfered with the taboo that Jin Wang could not tolerate others to touch, so Fucheng said very carefully.Jin Wang didn\u2019t say anything, but he frowned the eyebrows more tightly.He suddenly remembered the wet nurse and the indistinct white and towering breasts under the sweaty clothes.For a while, the familiar feelings of heat rose from the body, but Jin Wang had long been used to it. He only frowned his eyebrows and ignored it.The return of Jin Wang made everyone in the backyard move.In fact, Jin Wang could be regarded as a person who has pure mind. There are not many women in his backyard. For so many years, he only has consort Jin, side consort Hu, the ladies awarded by Emperor Hongjing when he left the capital and concubine Feng.It was very quiet in backyard when side consort Hu had not been there before. There are many battles in the frontier juncture. As the seignior, Jin Wang naturally bears the heavy responsibility to resist foreign aggression, so he leads the army all year round and rarely returns every year.As the master is not in the mansion, it is not necessary to fight with both open and secret means. Everyone naturally closes the door to live their own lives. But since Jin Wang brought back side consort Hu and she gave birth to a little princess, it seemed that there is something going down the stagnant pool.As Jin Wang returned to the mansion, he should meet consort Jin by rules.It\u2019s not about like or dislike, but it\u2019s respect that they should give to each other in their position. So early in the morning, Jin Wang arrived at Siyi Yard.The arrival of Jin Wang makes people in Siyi Yard get busy. All servants\u2019 faces are filled with joy. When side consort Hu,Madam Tao and Li came to pay respect to consort Jin, they could clearly feel the unusual atmosphere here.Madam Tao and Li showed admiration, but side consort Hu scorned.After they entered into the hall, they saw Jin Wang take the first place of honor and concubine Feng beside was sucking up to him.Jin Wang wears a bright blue brocade, the placket and cuffs of which are embroidered with silver threads. His black hair is tied to the top of the head, clasped with a three-finger wide inlaid sapphire red gold crown, which makes him even more handsome. His complexion is as clear as jade. How beautiful he is! Like a God from the Heaven!Concubine Feng is standing next to Jin Wang, who wears a begonia red dark flower cut silk cardigan tied with pomegranate skirts. She is combed with Suiyun bun, and a luen hair pin inlaid with rubies inserted in the hair. So beautiful and perfect!With narrow sleeves, the clothes are extremely well fitted with her thin waist. Her bosoms rise and fall as she breathes.Bitch!Side consort Hu clenched her fists in the sleeves firmly.Concubine Feng was promoted by consort Jin last year when side consort Hu was pregnant. She said that there are few people around Jin Wang and the backyard is too quiet. She was suspected out of duty as a consort. In fact, consort Jin knows that Madam Li and Tao are just puppets she intentionally set up in order to suppress side consort Hu.Concubine Feng deserves the responsibility given to her by consort Jin, and she is better at pandering to Jin Wang compered with side consort Hu. As long as Jin Wang is in the mansion, she will stare at side consort Hu and against her like a fighting cock. What a insidious woman full of tricks!The hatred of side consort Hu towards consort Jin mainly originated from concubine Feng. Unfortunately, concubine Feng takes advantage of consort Jin\u2019s power to bully others, so for the time being, side consort Hu could not do anything to her.Right now, side consort Hu and other two people still need to get approval to enter in the hall, but concubine Feng is already serving Jin Wang.A baker\u2019s wife may bite of a bun,a brewer\u2019s wife may bite of a tun. Nobody knows that such a man trap would seduce Wangye under the table.Side consort Hu thinks that though consort Jin is the consort of Jin Wang, she is actually like a a woman running a brothel. She has never seen which consort will rush to look for women for her own man. Early in the morning, she deliberately vacated the place and let concubine Feng serve Jin Wang. She is not afraid of being disgusted.Madam Tao and Li worshiped on bended knees with gloomy face.Jin Wang raised his hands slightly. His eye sight floating in the air seemed to be cold.After side consort Hu worshiped, she came to Jin Wang\u2019s side and was planning to say something, while consort Jin came out.The appearance of consort Jin brought a sudden change of the atmosphere in the hall, and Madam Tao and Li, who had secretly looked at Jin Wang suddenly converged. Even side consort Hu who had intended to sue the wicked first gave up to say anything.It felt like a mouse sees a cat.In fact, this is indeed the case. The concubine who see the sole legal wife is the same as a mouse who sees a cat.Of course, there is a bold mouse, such as side consort Hu.She is very perfunctory in regards to greet consort Jin.It\u2019s quiet in the hall. Maids in green sleeveless over-dress in succession put breakfast gently on the Eight Immortals table.Jin Wang and consort Jin moved to sit down at the table.Side consort Hu is standing aside. As Jin Wang pointed to a next place, side consort Hu immediately smiled and went to the chair.This smile naturally shows to to consort Jin and concubine Feng that she is still doted by Jin Wang. Unfortunately, consort Jin did not even glance at her once. Instead, concubine Feng secretly gritted her teeth, and she is anxious to rush up to drag her down the chair.Of course, this is just a thought.Madam Tao and Li and concubine Feng serve Jin Wang for dinner together.The three of them rolled their sleeves lightly and used the long-handled silver chopsticks to fetch food for Jin Wang and consort Jin. Every time Jin Wang returned from outside, such a performance would be put on the stage, and everyone is used to it.Compared with well-behaved actions of madam Tao and Li, concubine Feng is secretly casting flirtatious looks at Jin Wang. Her delicate and charming face is particularly attractive. Anyway, side consort Hu thinks that the bulging bosoms of that bitch almost stick to Jin Wang\u2019s arms.\u201cWangye, Please try this. The consort specially ordered servants to prepare this for you.\u201dJin Wang is still with no expression on his face. But side consort Hu is so angry to grit her teeth.Jin Wang went to the hall to drink tea after a meal. At this time, the big show just starts.Consort Jin gently mentioned the matter that she had selected two wet nurses carefully for the small lateral yard.She didn\u2019t talk in details. No one knew if Jin Wang had listened or not.Although side consort Hu did not speak as if she wanted to pour out grievance but saying nothing.Jin Wang did not express any opinion of his own, and consort Jin didn\u2019t speak too much. Side consort Hu felt extremely wronged that Jin Wang didn\u2019t care about her.Madam Tao and Li watched them silently and did not dare to speak.Although it is said a big show, it is actually quite boring. Because the contest and confrontation among them hide in every word and action, and even in their dress and make-up.For example, Madam Tao and Li who haven\u2019t long been doted dress up meticulously for Jin Wang. Mostly, they hope that Jin Wang could look at them more, then maybe he could meet them at night. For consort Jin, the kind of almost accusatory words just become a kind of invisible suppression to not only warn side consort Hu not to overrun, but also show her identity as the consort of Jin Wang.As for side consort Hu, she has not been stupid enough to refute what the consort said.She tried before, but Jin Wang ignored her. Jin Wang is a person who pays great attention to rules, and he always respects consort Jin on the surface.So even side consort Hu shows off or is wronged, it is just a kind of statement and a small protest against the legal wife. Even if she hates consort Jin inside, she will not tell Jin Wang directly.It is rare that concubine Feng, who is always impulsive does not rush forward to stir up the flames. After all, concubine Feng is not a fool so that she knows that she can\u2019t speak too much.So the so-called big show continued in a relatively calm situation until Jin Wang put down the tea cup and stood up.\u201cAll of you can leave now.\u201dJin Wang stepped out of the gate of Siyi Yard.Since the master is gone, who would like to stay on the stage?Consort Jin doesn\u2019t even want to say a word, so she let Ziyan help her to the inner room.Concubine Hu feels ashamed because consort Jin ignored her. She clenched the quilt in her hand and snorted, taking Taohong and a group of maids away.Then Madam Tao and Li left in silence.As for concubine Feng, she entered the inner room to massage legs for consort Jin. She didn\u2019t say anything, but her behavior was not only to show her loyalty, but to let the consort not give up on her.How could consort Jin give up on her?The more shotguns are, the better.Yucui fell asleep until dawn and was still a little stunned when she woke up.She thought of the little princess, wet nurse Su, and it seemed that no one woke her up yesterday.Why did she sleep so deeply? She was obviously very alert before.She subconsciously sat up from the bed, while she saw Yuyan standing upright and smiling at herself.Yucui was inexplicably a little embarrassed.Yuyan said: \u201cWake up? Mammy Mu said you are tired and let us not wake you up.\u201d\u201cWhere\u2019s wet nurse Su? How about the little princess?\u201d\u201cWet nurse Su returned to the house to have a rest. The little princess is very good. She slept all night. Wet nurse Su said that she ate breast milk once at night and now she is carried by wet nurse Qian to drink breast milk again.\u201dYucui took a sigh of relief, and said a little complicatedly: \u201cWhy didn\u2019t wet nurse Su wake me up?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it good to let you sleep comfortably?\u201d Yuyan said with a smile.Yucui blushed and laughed with her for a while before sighing: \u201cI never think that wet nurse Su is an honest person.\u201d She remembered what Yaoniang said yesterday, and the considerate behavior that Yaoniang did not wake her up.Yuyan smiled, \u201cWe don\u2019t know whether she is honest or not. We just wait and see.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201dSide consort Hu described very appropriately.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 17": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Jin Wang Dotes on His ConcubineCH 17Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayStaying up all night, Yaoniang fell asleep after returning to the room.She felt she did sleep a few minutes before she was woken by the knock at the door.There was an urgent knock at the door, while Yaoniang stumbled to open the door.Before walking to the door, she suddenly reacted, and then she went back to put on her outer shirt. And she scattered her long hairs around the shoulders arbitrarily and made a sole bun on her head before opening the door.Yaoniang never combed any other buns but common sole buns since she came to the small lateral yard.She opened the door. It was Lv\u2019e.There was not only Lv\u2019e, but also the second-class maid Qiuju in Liuchun Pavilion.Qiuju smiled, followed by a little girl with a tray in her hands.The tray was covered with a red cloth, and it was impossible to see what was inside.\u201cThis is the reward given by the side consort Hu to wet nurse Su.\u201dAfter they entered the room, the little girl uncovered the red cloth. There were two ingots of silver, a jade bracelet and a gilding hair clasp on the tray.Yaoniang was cramped and wanted to reject. Qiuju said with a smile: \u201cThe side consort said thanks to wet nurse Su. You solved the important issues for the side consort. The side consort didn\u2019t eat and sleep well these days, because they have tried all the methods but still can\u2019t cure the little princess\u2019s night crying disease.\u201d\u201cThis is the duty of mine.\u201dQiuju nodded, \u201cSince wet nurse Su is going to sleep, I will not disturb you any more. I will go back to reply to the side consort.\u201d\u201cTake care, Maid Qiuju.\u201dYaoniang sent Qiuju and others to the door, while she just happened to meet Cuizhu back to the house.Cuizhu got used to coming to the Liuchun Pavilion, so she recognized Qiuju. She knew that she is a girl around side consort Hu. Therefore, when she saw that Yaoniang and Qiuju were laughing together, what else did she not understand? She didn\u2019t dare to be angry at Qiuju, but she stared at Yaoniang with anger and resentment.Yaoniang pretended to not see her. She sent them away and closed the door.She came to the table and looked at the things on it.To be honest, the masters were really generous to servants in Jin Wang Mansion. These things were worth at least one hundred liang fine silver, which was worth half a year\u2019s salary of Yao Niang.The silver was less, only twenty liang. Although the jade bracelet and gold hair clasp were good things, they couldn\u2019t be exchanged for silver.Yaoniang picked up the gold hair clasp, and obviously there was the emblem of Jin Wang Mansion in a place which was not eye-catching. No one in the whole Jin Zhou dare accept this kind of things made in Jin Wang Mansion, which meant that these things could only be worn by herself, and it was impossible to change the silver.If she could change all things to silver, Yaoniang even had the urge to leave Jin Wang Mansion immediately.Because she could feel that the confrontation in this backyard was not what she can handle. What\u2019s more, after meeting with Jin Wang yesterday, Yaoniang found she was more afraid of him than she thought.What was she afraid of? In fact, she didn\u2019t understand. She just wanted to hide away, the farther, the better.After going through this, Yaoniang couldn\u2019t sleep. So she took advantage of today\u2019s fine weather to wash her clothes she changed yesterday.In this small lateral yard, sometimes she was busy, but sometimes she was idle. She just needed to take good care of the little princess. It was lively in the back room at this moment. Several rough women were sitting under the shade of the tree. They were doing some chores while talking with each other. Other two girls sat under the eave holding needles and threads in their hands and laughing from time to time.Yaoniang felt that time passed quickly, while she was listening to them and washing clothes by the well.Some old womans who had much experiences in the mansion asked about Yaoniang\u2019s family. She just told them a story without details that people couldn\u2019t find a mistake.They all showed mercy when hearing that Yaoniang\u2019s husband died as she was pregnant and her son was a posthumous child. They all said something to comfort Yaoniang.This was almost impossible situation in the past. It seemed that Mammy Mu promised to let Yaoniang serve the little princess to give a signal to everyone.A signal that they could be regard her as their own person.Since she was their own person, they had no worries when they were talking something. It was inevitable that some people would say something bad about Cuizhu, just because she was flexible in the past.It seemed that they wanted to please Yaoniang intentionally, and they were a bit displeased to Cuizhu. They talked about how Cuizhu fawned on people in Liuchun Pavilion, and all kinds of seductive attitudes were vividly described. For example, they said Cuizhu fawned on a woman called Mao, who had a double face. To put it plainly, she was good when there were some benefits to her. But when someone asked her to do things, she turned against her friends.\u201cYou just wait and see. She will suffer and be deceived.\u201d said a woman.Another woman laughed and teased her: \u201cIt\u2019s because she took a plate of pea and didn\u2019t give it to you last time. Instead, she went to Liuchun Pavilion and gave it to woman Mao. so you just got mad at her.\u201dObviously it was just a joke. That woman was unambiguous. While speaking of Cuizhu, she did not forget to fawn on Yaoniang: \u201cWho would be angry because of a dish of pea? I can\u2019t bear that she always jumps ups and downs and fawns on others. Wet nurse Su is not like her.\u201dWhy did they talk about her?As Yaoniang was thinking, suddenly she saw everyone changed their face. She saw that Cuizhu was coming.Cuizhu\u2019s face was darken, and her eyes glowed with resentment. She was shaking with anger.\u201cWell, you are a group of old witches who come to table to eat and scold their mothers after leaving. You still said bad words after having my food. How greedy you are\u2026\u201dShe made a mess because this was an indiscriminate attack. Suddenly several women stood up and quarreled with Cuizhu angrily.Even if Cuizhu was rude and unreasonable, she was not an opponent against to several people, finally she cried and ran away.\u201cLook, look at her! She is a maid but she just likes to pretend to be a lady. And she always calls someone to wash clothes and fetch water for her. She wants to order about everyone by giving us some snacks. Who cares about her snacks? It only because everyone cares our faces and we don\u2019t want to quarrel with her. But she even makes unfounded counter charges.\u201d The woman who ridiculed Cuizhu just now clapped her hands and said in an indignant tone.After what she said, it was all Cuizhu\u2019s fault.In fact, regardless of right or wrong, Cuizhu did a lot of ridiculous things. Otherwise people would not say that behind her.Yaoniang was most reluctant to deal with this kind of thing. She hung up the clothes and then left in a hurry.But Cuizhu was angry and faceless.Although she was born as a servant, she hadn\u2019t suffered such anger since she was a child. Especially when she entered the mansion, she always felt that things were not going well. First, Ghost in the machine. Then she was rejected and repelled by others. Now several women scolded her in front of her and she hadn\u2019t suffered that before.She hated this place now, obviously she didn\u2019t want to stay in this small lateral yard at all. She went out of the yard along the way and planned to go to find her aunt, woman Cao to ask her if she could find a chance to give a lesson to these women. As soon as she stepped out of the door, she was stopped by a little girl named Meizhi in Liuchun Pavilion.\u201cSister Cuizhu, where are you going? Anything happened?\u201dRecently, Cuizhu got along well with Meizhi, a second-class maid in Liuchun Pavilion. But she was young and greedy. Cuizhu occasionally took some snacks for her, and she coaxed the little girl to call her sister.In fact, Cuizhu was very cunning. Since she was arranged by consort Jin to pander to Jin Wang, of course, she must do it well. Maybe she could be doted by Jin Wang and the consort Jin would regard her with special respect.She didn\u2019t know anyone and anything when she just arrived. She naturally had to bribe two capable people as her scouts. For example, he wanted to know when will Wangye come to the Liuchun Pavilion and what is his favorite. There were a lot of opportunities.Meizhi was one of the people that Cuizhu wanted to bribe.With tears on Cuizhu\u2019s face, it was obvious that she was bullied. Seeing that she was silent, Meizhi came up to take her hand and said, \u201cSomeone bullied you?\u201dCuizhu always told Meizhi that she was bullied in the small lateral yard, so Meizhi knew a little bit about it.\u201cNothing.\u201d Cuizhu wiped her tears. After all, she was older than Meizhi. How could she cry in front of a little girl? In fact, she wasn\u2019t much older than Meizhi. She was only eighteen.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? I don\u2019t need to work today, what about you going to my room for a while? I can talk with you.\u201dCuizhu thought about it. She used to be strong outside, if she went out in such situation, many people would discuss about her, so she nodded her head.The two went to Meizhi\u2019s room together.As a second-class girl, Meizhi\u2019s room was naturally not as spacious as Cuizhu\u2019s. There were four canopy beds in a common room, and the inner bed was Meizhi\u2019s.There was no one in the room, and maybe most of them were on the duty.Meizhi closed the door and led Cuizhu to sit at the table, and then she poured a cup of tea for her.Cuizhu looked like a little bit embarrassed. The makeup on her face was all gone. Meizhi went to fetch a basin of water to let Cuizhu wash her face. She suddenly felt that Meizhi was a good friend.In such a mood, she couldn\u2019t help but complained.After listening to her bitter words, it turned out that Meizhi scolded those women with resentment as well, and then she looked at Cuizhu with anxiety and said, \u201cSister Cuizhu, don\u2019t think that I talk too much. You are a wet nurse in the mansion, but they bullied you like that. You may be not able to do this errand any longer.\u201dThis was exactly what Cuizhu was most afraid. For her, she was going to ride a donkey while looking for a horse. While she was working as a wet nurse, she did not forget to do something else. This was also the main reason why she always wanted to be around the little princess before.Unfortunately, wet nurse Su suddenly showed up now, and she stood firm with an almost unstoppable posture. Compared with the other two wet nurses, she came after them. There was no position for her around the little princess.\u201cSister Cuizhu looks so beautiful. It\u2019s a pity to be a wet nurse.\u201d Meizhi sighed.Yes, Cuizhu thought so, too!For various reasons, she immediately held Cuizhu\u2019s hands: \u201cMy good sister, you must help me.\u201dMeizhi was surprised and wondered: \u201cWhat can I do for you? I am just a maid.\u201dCuizhu moved to Meizhi\u2019s ear and said a lot of things, which made Meizhi startled.Cuizhu said: \u201cGood sister, if you help me, I will never forget your kindness, and I will help you at any time.\u201d\u201cThis\u2026 I\u2026\u201d\u201cDo you want to be a maid for life?\u201dNobody wants to be a maid for whole life!Although they were subordinates, the treatment to servants around masters was not worse than that of ordinary wealthy ladies. But they had to marry someone when they reached a certain age. If they can\u2019t reach a high status, their masters won\u2019t make a good marriage for them. But they were not willing to marry with man-servants or horse-keepers to live a poor life. The only way was to put themselves under the patronage of a higher-up.\u201cLet\u2019s join hands to help each other.\u201dJin Wang: Um, Your man was dead? Was Xiaobao a posthumous child?Yaoniang: Crying. He was dead. But where were you from?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 18": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Jin Wang Dotes on His ConcubineCH 18Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayYaoniang was arranged to take care of the little princess at night in case the princess would cry at night.Generally, she looked after the little princess with Yuyan or Yucui. The little princess who didn\u2019t cry at night was very easy to coax and rarely woke up. At most she would be hungry and woke up once or twice. As for if she pooed, Yaoniang wouldn\u2019t wake her up as long as she changed the diapers gently.Every night, it was the quietest time in the small building, but today there was a loud noise outside.Because Yaoniang was in the east room, she didn\u2019t hear it very clearly. She only knew that someone came.Yaoniang and Yuyan were on night duty. Yuyan went out to have a look and returned after a while. She looked a little dignified: \u201cDon\u2019t wander at night.\u201dWander at night?She was on night duty and there was no place she could go.Yaoniang was not clear about the meaning at first. But as she saw Yuyan was cautious, she couldn\u2019t ask her more questions. So she could only keep the doubts in her mind.She understood what was going on till she was on duty the next night.In the Liuchun Pavilion, there was only a light in a corner of the house. The halo light lined with the cherry pink gauze curtain in the room, revealing a little bit of ambiguous atmosphere. On the chest of drawers, the incense powder already lit in a one feet high gilt beast head incense burner with three feet. The special fragrance spread quietly from the hollow lotus petals under the beast head cover button, and it was full of the room.Side consort Hu wore a carmine skirt with rosy clouds and a shirt with a same color on the shoulder. Her long hair was with only a flower on the sideburns, which looked a little charming and enchanting.She leaned halfway to the side of Jin Wang\u2019s legs and raised her beautiful neck to look at the man sitting on the soft bed.Jin Wang wore a black brocade robe whose placket and cuffs are embroidered with complicated patterns with gold threads. His black hair was tied to the top of the head and clasped with a white jade crown. His complexion was as clear as jade. He was very handsome and looked like a god from the Heaven.Compared with the clothes that side consort Hu wore which only fitted in the boudoir, there was no doubt that Jin Wang\u2019s costume was much more formal.At this moment, he leaned on the soft bed in a relaxed state. His eyes narrowed and lowered. He seemed to be careless or be thinking about something. He put his slender, fair-bodied big palm on the table, and tapped on it with his finger from time to time.\u201cWangye\u2026\u201d Side consort Hu called him softly.Jin Wang just raised his eyebrows and took a glance at her. Side consort Hu\u2019s cheeks were red and showed a kind of strange expression. She moved her hand back and forth on Jin Wang\u2019s legs, which looked very seductive.\u201cWangye\u2026\u201dSide consort Hu called him again, but Jin Wang didn\u2019t do anything. Then she bit her red lips and stood up with her hands putting on the soft couch, and she snuggled up next to Jin Wang.She looked up at him humbly.At this point, Jin Wang finally faced up to her.Jin Wang under the light was so handsome that people dare not to look directly, and his deep eyes were as attractive as black holes.Side consort Hu was anxious and preoccupied. She was so excited that she could not control herself. While she was thinking of what to do next, she pursed her lips with a little nervous, and her mouth was dry.\u201cWangye\u2026\u201dSide consort Hu\u2019s face was more and more red, and her phoenix eyes seemed to drip water. Her white fingers circled around Jin Wang\u2019s chest.After a few times, her fingers slipped into his placket. Jin Wang seemed to be in a good mood today, but he just looked down at her fingers under the clothes and didn\u2019t stop her.Side consort Hu felt a kind of subtle encouragement, and her snake-like body got much closer to Jin Wang. She seemed to want Jin Wang to embrace her into his bones to get the ultimate satisfaction.She moved up slowly, at last, her whole body covered Jin Wang. Due to the majesty of Jin Wang. She did not dare to touch his body with red lips at will, and she only dare hold Jin Wang\u2019s hand to touch around herself.She didn\u2019t realize that Jin Wang with eyes half closed frowned more and more tightly. The big palm on the table tightened into fists, but he did not say anything to stop her movements.\u201cWangye\u2026\u201dThe side consort Hu panted heavily, and Jin Wang\u2019s attitude which was different from the previous finally made her lose her mind. She used all the methods she had been taught by the procuress in the brothel before.These methods had been repeated in her mind thousands of times in order to be able to use it someday.There is no doubt that side consort Hu loves Jin Wang, not only his appearance, but also his identity.Side consort Hu found that she could live in a such life after she came to the mansion.Everyone looked up to her on the ground. Except for consort Jin, she was already the most powerful person in the backyard, but she still thought this was not enough. She also needs a son.Suddenly, the whole world was turned upside down. Side consort Hu fell to the ground.Her clothes were messy, and the bellyband hanging around her neck was already pulled down and rolled around her waist.It was pulled off by side consort Hu herself.No matter what she did just now, Jin Wang did not touch her. Only when she tore off her bellyband and wanted to show herself to Jin Wang that her figure was more attractive than before after she gave birth to a child, Jin Wang grabbed her neck and threw her away.Actually, side consort Hu was beautiful, not only her face but also her body. Her tender and soft bosoms were trembling, even a few drops of breast milk dripped from the flower core.\u201cHow dare you!\u201dJin Wang on the soft bed took out a white handkerchief to cover his cold pale lips slightly. His face was cold, and he stared at side consort Hu like a ferocious beast.In fact, this was the real Jin Wang. While Jin Wang usually had stern temperament with a high degree of alienation and a sense of grace and nobility. At this time, his noble temperament was completely released, and he was really like the person who killed countless people on the battlefield without even blinking his eyes.Side consort Hu was totally startled to touch her neck.Fucheng came from outside and asked in a low voice, \u201cWangye\u2026\u201dThen Jin Wang calmed down and stood up from the bed. He even didn\u2019t glance at the side consort Hu and hummed before he left.While he was walking, he used the white handkerchief to cover his mouth.Taohong hurried in from outside. When she saw side consort Hu slumped to the ground in such a embarrassing manner, she couldn\u2019t help but wanted to cover her eyes. In the end, side consort Hu was a bit abnormal. Taohong didn\u2019t dare to think about it and helped her up.Taohong\u2019s action seemed to open the mechanism, which made the side consort Hu suddenly cry. She cried extremely sadly. She was sad, unbelievable, hopeless and dazed.Side consort Hu never expected that Jin Wang would treat her in this way. She was very confused. She didn\u2019t care about her respect and couldn\u2019t stop crying.\u201cHe didn\u2019t even want to touch me\u2026\u201d she cried vaguely.Taohong was anxious. When she heard this, she thought side consort must have annoyed Jin Wang.In fact, Taohong could almost understand what happened, but the pleasure of the two masters should not be interrupted by a maid. At the beginning, side consort Hu went on her own way once before and she persuaded her. But side consort Hu didn\u2019t listen to her suggestion. So she dared not to speak out to dissuade her. Therefore it had adverse effect this time.Wangye had always been indifferent and noble, so how could he fall into such a trap?At the same time, Taohong also had a very vague aversion to side consort Hu. She left the brothel already but why didn\u2019t she change her manners?\u201cDon\u2019t cry, Niangniang. Wangye has always treated you differently. He was just angry at that time. So you don\u2019t have to worry.\u201dSide consort Hu did not listen.\u201c\u2026 Don\u2019t forget. You have the little princess. Wangye won\u2019t really be angry with you\u2026\u201dThe words awakened side consort Hu. She immediately stopped crying and rubbed her face twice. She asked Taohong: \u201cWangye has gone? Where is he going?\u201d\u201cIt seems that he was going to the small lateral yard.\u201d\u201cDid the guards outside leave?\u201dTaohong shook her head.The pale face of side consort Hu suddenly showed a smile, and she kept mumbling: \u201cWangye still cares about me, Wangye still cares about me\u2026\u201dTaohong sighed in her heart.In the middle of the night, it was quiet in the small building.Yuyan had fallen asleep on the chaise bed, making a steady breathing sound. Yaoniang changed the diaper lightly for the little princess, and put the dirty diaper in the basin after the folding screen, and then she went to the tea room.There was a tea room in the lateral yard, which was a cubicle in the west.Everything were available in tea house. There was a water-burning stove with continuous charcoal. It could supply daily tea and hot water at night for the small building.Yaoniang wanted to wash her hands and she was thirsty, but there was no water in the kettle.When she reached the tea room, she took a bamboo tube to blow to the mouth of the furnace.She used too much strength that though the fire was ignited, a burst of smoke was also stirred up, which made her cough for a few times, so she naturally ignored the movement behind her.Yaoniang was sobbed with tears. She grasped the handkerchief and waved her hands in front of her nose. At the same time, she stood up. Just feeling better, she looked up, and then she was frightened.She did not know when Jin Wang stood behind her.He was wearing a black silk robe, and his long dark hair was slightly messy scattered on his shoulders and chest. It seemed that he combed a bun in the day with a slightly curved arc, so now the hair was winding down to the waist. While his waist became stronger and thinner, he had a good figure with wide shoulders and thin waist.Of course, Yaoniang knew that Jin Wang\u2019s figure was very good. She had seen many times in her last life.A picture appeared in her mind\u2013She was pressed on the table. She could only bend over on it, but because of his request, she leaned her head slightly to bear his lick.Out of the corner of her eyes, she saw his strong and tight waist. Over and over again, his action was like waves. She could only immerse herself in it, wondering how he should react\u2026Yaoniang\u2019s face was already a little red, but now it was even more red because of cranky thoughts in her mind.Jin Wang frowned at the blushing wet nurse in front of him.The eyes were bright and moist after being washed by tears. In the middle were the big, dark pupils and the corners of the eyes were slightly raised, which didn\u2019t make people feel uncomfortable. It was red around the eye sockets. She, a timid little rabbit looked extraordinarily affectionate with white skin.She seemed to be aware of her gaffe and quickly bowed her head. Because she bowed her head too low, it made people feel that her slender neck would break.\u201cMake a cup of tea for me.\u201dJin Wang no longer looked at her. He said lightly and went to the chair next to her to sit down.New week, new chapters. I will keep updating regularly. Last time, I said I want to find an editor to help me to fix the grammer mistakes and make the whole text more fluent and smooth. Apprently, some readers have contacted with me, but I didn\u2019t get their further replies until now. I will keep looking for an editor for this good novel. I really thanks for your interest. Let\u2019s make things better together.If you like this novel, please give a high rate on NU so that more people will have a chance to know this.

    "Chapter 19": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Jin Wang Dotes on His ConcubineCH 19.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIt was so quiet in the tea room that you might hear a pin drop.Yaoniang was startled but she quickly reacted and turned around.She squatted helplessly in front of the stove and held a cattail leaf fan to fan the fire hole manually, trying to make the water in the copper pot boil faster.How did Jin Wang in this dress appear in this small building?Yaoniang was full of such thoughts. But at the same time there was a hint of enlightenment in her heart. No wonder Yuyan told her yesterday not to walk around at night. Today Yaoniang vaguely reminded that there was a noise outside but she didn\u2019t pay much attention because she was breastfeeding the little princess.Although Yaoniang stayed in the small lateral yard, she was still well-informed.This was attributed to the loose-mouthed women in the lateral yard. Yaoniang doesn\u2019t work during day time, so she would inevitably meet them in private. During the day, she heard the women say that no one could be compared to that woman in Liuchun Pavilion. Since Jin Wang returned to the mansion, he slept in Liuchun Pavilion when he went to the back yard for the first time.Of course they were talking about what happened yesterday but Jin Wang actually went to the small building last night.She suddenly remembered the second floor of the small building, which no one is allowed to access\u2026The water was boiling while she was pondering. There came a buzzing sound from the spout of the kettle, and white smoke rushed out of the lid.Since she filled the pot with so much water it overflowed as soon as it boiled.Yaoniang hurriedly stood up. Due to the heat, she withdrew her hand and could only turn around to find a rag. During this time she knocked over tea cups and teapots on the table next to her making a series of crisp and messy sounds.The more nervous she was the more she fumbled. When she finally lifted the kettle up from the stove, there was already a mess on the table in front of her.Yaoniang looked at all this in frustration. She intended to find a hole to crawl into. She dare not turn around nor imagine what Jin Wang looks like now. She just wanted to make tea and then leave as soon as possible.Jin Wang frowned, staring at Yaoniang\u2019s back.Yaoniang was not so clumsy that day when he saw her. Jin Wang remembered how Mammy Mu praised her. He became grim.It\u2019s impossible for Mammy Mu to lie. The wet nurse must have done this intentionally.Jin Wang thought that Yaoniang deliberately wanted to get his attention.Jin Wang grew up in the imperial palace with a distinguished status. He had seen all kinds of women who tried their best to be an elitist.In order to be doted by the Emperor, the women in the imperial harem used every means and did many conspiracy. Some deliberately showed their outstanding appearances and graceful figures; some even made a fool of themselves to attract attention.He glared at the approaching woman dressed in ordinary clothes. The common face and the long neck seemed to be extraordinarily white against the dark clothes.Her skin was like an egg that had been stripped off the shell. Under the yellow light, it felt like a layer of honey is on the surface, looking aromatic and luscious.Glancing at her walking posture again. Despite being covered, Jin Wang could not ignore her bosoms and swaying hips.What is she doing? A married woman who has given birth to a child!Jin Wang frowned with disgust in his heart. At the same time, he pulled out a handkerchief from his sleeve and half-covered his thin lips. Then he looked at Yaoniang coldly.Yaoniang became very anxious. She is absolutely terrified because of his cold glare. She no longer care about etiquette. She placed the tea cup down and hastily said that she had to go look after the little princess then ran away.Jin Wang was startled.Yaoniang ran all the way back to the east room. She didn\u2019t slow down until she was at the door.She pushed the door open. Yucui woke up and asked her where she went. Yaoniang told her she met Jin Wang when she went to the tea room to drink water.Yuyan looked at Yaoniang and hesitated. Then she said, \u201cIt\u2019s better that only you know this thing, don\u2019t spread it outside. The masters have their own intentions in doing things. Remember not to make a fuss.\u201dYaoniang froze and immediately nodded.After Jin Wang drank tea, he went up to the second floor.At midnight, he felt thirsty but it was inconvenient in this small building compared to Zhaohui Hall. Since Fucheng has fallen asleep, he is not a person who needs to be served in everything so he went to the tea room to drink tea himself.He never expected to meet that wet nurse.Jin Wang went to the second floor and was still thinking about the wet nurse. His impression of this person is vague because the other party always liked to lower her head. The only thing that impressed him was her fair skin, red round eyes, and that day\u2026Jin Wang couldn\u2019t help but think of the scene he saw that day. Underneath the turquoise veil, her white skin was wrapped in deep red\u2026From the back of his mind, Jin Wang suddenly remembered what had previously happened in the Liuchun Pavilion.Jin Wang is born in the imperial palace and knew pandering ways that many women use but he did not expect that someone would one day use this on him.As long as he thought of the fair skin and breast milk dripping, Jin Wang would feel nauseous and this mental change would also cause physical reactions.Jin Wang took out a handkerchief from his sleeve and half-covered his thin lips, and worked hard to press down the nausea that kept rising upwards, but he couldn\u2019t\u2026Fucheng heard the sound and hurriedly walked in from outside.\u201cWangye\u2026\u201dLooing at Jin Wang, Fucheng understood what had happened. A tea cup is placed on the table next to him. He touched the cup and found it was still hot. He handed it to Jin Wang and hurriedly went to fetch a cold handkerchief.Jin Wang drank most of the tea and then covered his face with the handkerchief for a while before finally suppressing the feeling of nausea.Fucheng is worried. When he thought of Side consort Hu, he couldn\u2019t help but sigh in his heart. Why did she do that? There was no use for her to put such effort but it made Wangye feel disgusted.\u201cWangye, How about I go find Doctor Liu\u2026\u201dJin Wang immediately took off the handkerchief and gave him a steely gaze. Fucheng didn\u2019t even speak in the end.\u201cMy apologies, I spoke too much.\u201d\u201cGo on.\u201dIt was Yaoniang\u2019s turn to sleep in the second half of the night. But she didn\u2019t sleep well and couldn\u2019t sleep until almost dawn, she took a nap after a while.Hey, dear readers. I finally find an editor to help me edit this beautiful novel. Her name is Silkscreen. She is an avid reader and enjoys discovering novels from all over the world. She is a budding writer but placed her training on hold to help Little Monster with her translation work (cause she likes Little Monster). I reaaly appreacite her work. She will help me translate this novel much more properly.And so far, I actually have no stock and Silkscreen and I want to release new chapters a little slowly in order to take time to improve the translation quality.Thanks for your support. We still have a long but worthy way to go. Wish you like this novel. Have a good day!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Wet nurse Wang and Yucui came very early just after dawn. She helped them clean the little princess\u2019 room and then returned to hers.As she went downstairs, she turned to look at the small building behind her.At the break of dawn, the exquisite small building stood like a Behemoth. Yaoniang thought of the person on the second floor and wondered if he was gone.In the previous life, she would not get up until the afternoon after she was on night duty. But today she only slept for an hour in the room and then got up.She doesn\u2019t know why but she just couldn\u2019t sleep.Since she can\u2019t sleep and had nothing to do, Yaoniang went to the small kitchen.Naturally, the small kitchen is the most lively place in the whole small lateral courtyard. It is independent from the large kitchen of the mansion and it controls the food in the small courtyard.The one who manages the kitchen is a woman named Mo. She is good at cooking and specializes in special cuisine.There were ordinary and special meals in the small kitchen. The special meal refers to more refined food. For example, wet nurses, Mammy Mu, Yucui and others have special meals, while the ordinary meal is prepared for other women and maids.As soon as one enters the small kitchen, there is a large table in the middle used for processing food. There are three stoves on the front side of the wall for special meals. On the left is a communal pot and on the right is for boiling water.Yaoniang walked into the small lively kitchen.Several women carried out their duties and two other little girls were squatting at a corner to cut vegetables for cooking. Everyone were talking and laughing. After seeing Yaoniang walk in, a woman named Wang greeted her with a smile: \u201cWhy did wet nurse Su come so early? Are you hungry?\u201dMadam Mo, who was chopping vegetables in front of the table looked at Yaoniang, \u201cIf you are hungry, there are buns left on the stove.\u201dYaoniang shook her head and said with some embarrassment, \u201cI am not hungry but I have nothing to do when I woke up.\u201dEveryone nodded in understanding. One of the women went to move a stool for her and handed her some anise beans, \u201cSit here and talk to us.\u201dYaoniang didn\u2019t take it, \u201cThank you, but I can\u2019t eat this.\u201dA woman next to her interjected: \u201cHow could you?! Wet nurse Su breastfeeds the little princess. She can\u2019t eat those.\u201dMadam Wang didn\u2019t get upset and said with a smile, \u201cI forgot.\u201dYaoniang was a little uneasy: \u201cI\u2019ll find something to do. I\u2019ll go help Xiangcao.\u201d Then she went to the open space near the right side of the door where two girls were squatting.One is called Xiangcao and the other is called Xiangxiang. They are both maids in the kitchen.\u201cWet nurse Su, please have a sit.\u201d Xiangcao went to find a small stool and handed it to Yaoniang, then said to her, \u201cHow can we let you help us? It\u2019s just a few vegetables. Xiangxiang and I will finish soon.\u201dShe took out a cucumber in the vegetable basket and washed it outside then brought it back to Yaoniang.\u201cIt\u2019s very fresh. Have a taste!\u201dYaoniang could only take it and eat it slowly while watching Xiangcao and Xiangxiang cut vegetables.Everyone started to ask if the little princess slept sweetly during the night and then talked about other things.There were some gossips in the mansion, such as a woman quarreled with someone or a maid scolded by the master. The mansion seemed to be quite large but, in fact, the backyard accounts for only one third of it. Everyone meets regularly and some trivial things would inevitably be passed on to everyone.\u201cHey, you don\u2019t know. Today I went out and saw that Ling\u2019er of Liuchun Pavilion and Meng\u2019er of Rugui Pavilion argued with each other.\u201d The woman who spoke is called Zhao. Her tone showed that there is a great drama that happened.For a moment, everyone looked at her and some people couldn\u2019t help but ask her to say it quickly.\u201cWhat can it be? It\u2019s just some trivial matters. People in the main kitchen gave food boxes prepared for Liuchun Pavilion to Rugui Pavilion. Liuchun Pavilion stole the show at present while Wangye is still in the mansion, so Ling\u2019er is exceptionally arrogant. She stopped Meng\u2019er halfway and slapped her twice on the face.\u201d\u201cWell, Meng\u2019er looks quite pretty. Her face must be swollen after two slaps.\u201d\u201cExactly! Her little face was as red and purple as an eggplant. I remember that Ling\u2019er and Meng\u2019er had a quarrel before. It is said that Meng\u2019er is the same as her master and doesn\u2019t respect anyone in Liuchun Pavilion. Side consort Hu is also a bad-tempered woman and she must have previously scolded Ling\u2019er. So all the old and recent grudges made them fight.Ling\u2019er and Meng\u2019er are both responsible for fetching dishes. In Jin Wang Mansion, except for Zhaohui Hall where Jin Wang lived, the Siyi Yard where consort Jin lived and the small lateral courtyard of the princess, all meals come from the main kitchen. Side consort Hu also mentioned setting up a small kitchen in the Liuchun Pavilion. Unfortunately, it was rejected by consort Jin, so meals in Liuchun Pavilion are all provided by the main kitchen.\u201cWell, people in Liuchun Pavilion cause trouble as soon as Jin Wang comes back. When Wangye leaves the house\u2026\u201d She didn\u2019t finish the sentence but everyone knew what it meant.It meant that side consort Hu takes advantage of Wangye\u2019s power to show she is currently being doted .Actually, she is really doted on by Wangye now.When they talked about this, everyone\u2019s eyes became very ambiguous.\u201cHey, if it continues like this, Wangye keeps staying at Liuchun Pavilion in the past two days, maybe consort Jin will do something\u2026\u201d Then the woman seemed to suddenly realize the origin of Yaoniang, and immediately she shut up.A few women winked at each other and turned to another topic.Yaoniang listened to this but she was thinking of whether they also talked about her like this in her previous life.At the same time, she was more concerned about Jin Wang staying in Liuchun Pavilion for two nights. But why did she see Jin Wang in the small building? Was he a fake Jin Wang?So far, Silkscreen and I have been working hard to improve the translation quality, while at the same time, we are a little worried about losing the Authour\u2019s writing voice, so I am considering looking for one who can help us proofread the edited lines so it still sounds like how the Chinese author wrote it. You\u2019d better understand both the Chinese and English.

She could only hide it in her heart.While she was pondering, a little girl rushed in from outside and yelled, \u201cSomething happened outside.\u201d\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cLiuchun\u2013 Liuchun Pavilion, side consort Hu wants to punish Cuizhu with flogging\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Why would Cuizhu be beaten?\u201dEveryone stared speechless at one another. Yaoniang couldn\u2019t help but have a bad premonition.\u201cI heard that Cuizhu stole side consort Hu\u2019s jewelry, which Qiao\u2019er found. That hairpin was rewarded to side consort Hu by Jin Wang and she likes it very much, so side consort Hu was furious when she found out Cuizhu stole it\u2026\u201dSomeone could not help but cut in: \u201cCuizhu is from the lateral courtyard, how could side consort Hu hit her without restraint\u2026?\u201d After saying this, she couldn\u2019t continue speaking.Side consort Hu is a master, while Cuizhu is only a wet nurse. The wet nurse is also a servant, not to mention Cuizhu was born in an ordinary family. Even if she is a civilian, under the identity of side consort Hu, she could also be beaten to death. Cuizhu can\u2019t even cry out a protest.\u201cWhat about taking a look?\u201dThey can\u2019t help but get curious and see what happened. Although it\u2019s just a wet nurse, she is still involved with so many people. She was arranged by consort Jin in Siyi courtyard and her aunt is Madam Cao who still works in the mansion. What more, the whole family of Cuizhu are maids of consort Jin and Cuizhu is the wet nurse of the little princess.Side consort Hu intends to go against consort Jin. The latter has also expected side consort Hu will cause troubles.In the Liuchun Pavilion, Cuizhu is thrown on the ground and looked extremely embarrassed.Her deep red shirt is covered with dust. Her hair is messy and her face is dirty but she is staring at one person in the crowd.That is Meizhi.Cuizhu never expected Meizhi to set her up in such way. She did not know why side consort Hu\u2019s hairpin was on her body. Before that, she kept talking with Meizhi. But no matter how she explained it, no one believed her except for Meizhi, several maids stood up to prove that she sneaked into side consort Hu\u2019s room.Cuizhu knows that this is a deliberate trap set up for her.Actually, this trap is very sketchy. How could she enter side consort Hu\u2019s room and steal her hairpin? Did they think she lost her mind!No one paid attention to this. Since the master said you did it then you have done it.There are many people standing around. Most of them servants in the Liuchun Pavilion while some are from the lateral courtyard. Most people from the lateral courtyard stood in the background looking at Cuizhu who is thrown on the ground with a sullen expression.In fact, everyone understood the reason. But if Cuizhu didn\u2019t go to Liuchun Pavilion, this kind of thing wouldn\u2019t have happen.Yaoniang is also here.She knew she shouldn\u2019t have come but she\u2019s here already. She wants to see what will happen next. She remembers that she was punished by side consort Hu in her previous life and she was also beaten several times.She never thought that in this lifetime she would not take the lead, instead it is Cuizhu\u2019s turn to suffer.She felt a bleak sense of sadness.\u201cSide consort Hu told us to punish her with flogging five times. A stumble may prevent a fall.\u201d Qiuju came out of the house and said on the stairs.After all, side consort Hu still did not dare to kill people from Siyi courtyard.Someone responded. After a while, two women came over with a bench and a plank.Cuizhu\u2019s mouth has been blocked for a while now because she shouted. The woman tied her up on the bench and said, \u201cIt\u2019s just five floggings, which can\u2019t kill anyone. You should learn a lesson from now on.\u201dCuizhu was flogged and only the sound of muffled hum could be heard.Yaoniang didn\u2019t want to look again and quietly left.She was a little bit sad. She remembered what happened to her in the previous life.Five floggings didn\u2019t hurt too much. After Cuizhu was beaten, she could also walk by herself.Before side consort Hu spoke, Mammy Mu ordered people to send Cuizhu away.For now, it is inappropriate for Cuizhu to stay in the lateral courtyard. Not to mention whether she stole side consort Hu\u2019s hairpin or not, there are many wet nurses around the little princess. If Cuizhu is not here, a lot of trouble will be avoided.Obviously, Cuizhu is a troublemaker. Mammy Mu would not let the troublemaker stay with the little princess.Yaoniang was suddenly enlightened that perhaps she was sent away in her previous life like this. It doesn\u2019t matter whether you made a mistake or was wronged. The people above do not care. They only measure fundamentally whether you could stay or not and they don\u2019t care what kind of results this would bring to the other person\u2019s life.Yaoniang wanted to avoid these things simply relying on the lessons from her previous life. But after seeing Cuizhu\u2019s outcome with her own eyes, she had a deep understanding.Recognizing the reasoning of the superior.She thinks that Cuizhu will come back again if consort Jin really thinks as she guessed.Sure enough, Cuizhu returned the next day and was sent to Liuchun Pavilion by consort Jin.Consort Jin said that side consort Hu is skillful in teaching the servants and this unmanageable girl should be sent to her for a lesson. Although the consequence is totally different from that in Yaoniang\u2019s previous life, they ended up in the same way.What will happen to Cuizhu?As soon as Yaoniang thought about it, she couldn\u2019t help but shiver.Why did she think consort Jin is a good person in her previous life?However, when Cuizhu came to the lateral courtyard to pack her things, Yaoniang saw her smiling face.Seeing Yaoniang, Cuizhu\u2019s face was full of conceit: \u201cWet nurse Su, you stayed up all night yesterday. Don\u2019t you need to rest today?\u201dYaoniang was speechless.\u201cEach person is different. Some people are born to be slaves, while some are destined to be different.\u201d Then Cuizhu left with her things. Yaoniang watched her back and was at a loss.At first, Yaoniang couldn\u2019t understand why Cuizhu is so arrogant but she realized immediately that perhaps everyone\u2019s pursuit is different. She thought of how Cuizhu enjoys her bitterness as if it were malt sugar.She wondered if Consort Jin said something to Cuizhu.The development of the matter had been completely different from that of the previous life. Yaoniang finally did not have to worry about repeating the same mistakes. But all this did not let her guard down, in fact she was even more cautious than before.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She is useless even if you put her there.\u201dConsort Jin on the chaise bed was reading a book. After hearing this, she looked up at Mammy Zhou and said, \u201cMy wet nurse, I don\u2019t think she is useful anymore.\u201d\u201cSo\u2026\u201dMammy Zhou soon understood. Apparently, consort Jin wants to cause some trouble on side consort Hu.But owing to the loss of Cuizhu, it is even harder to suppress the Liuchun Pavilion, which means that all the plans she had made before is in chaos now.\u201cDon\u2019t forget there is another person.\u201d consort Jin smiled happily.Under the sunlight, her face is flushed with a kind of malicious beauty. Obviously, she seems too weak to even bear the weight of her clothing. Yet there is a wise temperament that couldn\u2019t be ignored between her eyebrows.Consort Jin deserves to be born in Xu Duke Mansion. Her mind and means are first-class but she is burdened by her weak body. Whenever she thought of this, Mammy Zhou couldn\u2019t help but sigh.\u201cDid you mean wet nurse Su?\u201d Madam Zhou hesitated to say.Consort Jin nodded: \u201cDon\u2019t you think this woman is extremely clever? She hid herself regarding what happened to Cuizhu and quickly established her foothold next to the little princess. She is much smarter than Cuizhu. I looked down on her once before.\u201d\u201cBut it seems that she doesn\u2019t want to put herself under the patronage of any higher-ups. It was said that wet nurse Su is very low-key and never takes a step out of the lateral courtyard. She rarely goes out and either stays in the room or takes care of the little princess.\u201d\u201cHave you forgotten Wangye? He often goes to visit the little princess.\u201dMammy Zhou was still in a daze but consort Jin said again, \u201cWhich woman doesn\u2019t like Wangye?\u201d She lowered her eyes with a smile, giving the illusion that she is a most unusual and quite individual beauty.This is the case. Jin Wang is handsome with high quality, noble with dignity and born with the appearance of the prince. When he was in the imperial capital, many girls were attracted to him but consort Jin married him.Just\u2013In fact, Mammy Zhou always has this question she dare not ask: Consort Jin, do you even like Jin Wang?If she likes Jin Wang, why does she not approach Wangye actively? If she doesn\u2019t like him, why does she go against side consort Hu?Mammy Zhou dare not ask. She remembered consort Jin almost died before she got married to Jin Wang.Consort Jin once tried to commit suicide.Mammy Zhou always thought that consort Jin didn\u2019t want to marry Jin Wang and maybe she was in love with another person. But as the wet nurse of consort Jin, she knew that consort Jin never looked at any man with quite different eyes before getting married.Mammy Zhou doubted this in her heart for many years and maybe she will hide it for a lifetime.In Liuchun Pavilion, side consort Hu gloomily watched Cuizhu walk around in front of her.In fact, Cuizhu\u2019s attitude is very humble. But in side consort Hu\u2019s eyes, she could see the arrogance and sinister intention hidden behind her humble face.Side consort Hu even saw a face through her, which is the face of consort Jin.A cold, pale and indifferent face that contains a lot of malice. She could even see consort Jin laugh at her full of disdain and irony.No matter how you are doted on, you have to be controlled by me. All the favors are fake\u2026 Without Wangye, you are nothing\u2026Side consort Hu could not help but tremble with anxiety in her heart.It can\u2019t go on like this anymore!Side consort Hu suddenly stood up.\u201cNiangniang!\u201dTaohong screamed anxiously and looked at her in surprise. Apparently she moved too suddenly, which caused Taohong to misunderstand something.Side consort Hu looked at Taohong\u2019s eyes and was even angrier (more upset). Is she such an irrational person?She didn\u2019t explain anything but took a deep breath and said, \u201cI\u2019ll go see the little princess.\u201dTaohong was relieved.The Liuchun Pavilion can\u2019t bear anything else right now.In the east room, Mammy Mu was sitting on a Padauk Arhat bed inlaid with turquoise jades and landscape painting. Side consort Hu was sitting opposite her.Yuyan brought two cups of tea and placed them on the table, side consort Hu just held it but did not drink. It could be seen that side consort Hu has not slept well in the past few days because there are dark circles under her beautiful phoenix eyes.Side consort Hu was about to speak but said nothing. Mammy Mu was drinking tea and it seemed that she didn\u2019t care why side consort Hu showed up.After all, side consort Hu couldn\u2019t hold back her composure. She hesitated for a while and spoke of her intention: \u201cWell, Mammy. I\u2019ve missed the little princess. Could I bring the little princess to Liuchun Pavilion for one night?\u201dUnlike her arrogance when she face consort Jin, she is very humble in front of Mammy Mu.Side consort Hu is not stupid. She knows who Mammy Mu stands for and her identity\u2014 the Mammy next to former consort De. After consort De died, she had been serving beside Jin Wang. Jin Wang respects her very much and treats her as an elder.These are enough for side consort Hu to respect Mammy Mu.Unlike consort Jin, Mammy Mu is Jin Wang\u2019s direct servant.Jin Wang didn\u2019t appear in this chapter. But I have to do this because the contents of this chapter are connected closely with how the plots flow, including promoting the relationship between the two leading roles.The following contents will concentrate on below: relationship of the two leading roles; whether the little princess is Jin Wang\u2019s own child or not; side consort Hu and consort Jin\u2019s hidden intentions; when will Jin Wang know he also has a son; will Yaoniang know that something happened between Jin Wang and her?All of the above will be figured out in the following chapters. Stay tuned!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 23": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Jin Wang Dotes on His ConcubineCH 21.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayMammy Mu looked at side consort Hu, knowing everything.Probably because she came from the Imperial Palace, this insight hidden beneath the surface is subtle and mysterious.Side consort Hu had this kind of feeling, so she was extremely on pins and needles.\u201cDid Wangye agree?\u201dHer words made side consort Hu feel a little embarrassed but she also knew that she has to succeed in reaching an agreement with Mammy Mu in order to achieve her purpose.She went to Zhaohui Hall twice before but she wasn\u2019t even allowed to enter the door. All this caused her to panic and she even wondered if Consort Jin knew something, otherwise she would not do so much as to send Cuizhu back for no reason.She absolutely cannot fall out of favor.Once she falls out of favor, it is enough for consort Jin and concubine Feng to skin her alive.And with this thought side consort Hu clutched her hands under her sleeves and started to cry. She cried so sadly with a sense of desolation and uneasiness that she couldn\u2019t even care about her dignity.She didn\u2019t choose to hide her emotions for the sake of face but said that she accidentally offended Jin Wang last night without any specific details.This incident is not a secret to Mammy Mu. Although she was not in the small building at that time, she soon heard about it.Sometimes even Mammy Mu doesn\u2019t understand what Jin Wang is thinking but this won\u2019t prevent her from doing something of her own will. Side consort Hu is stupid that she often offends Jin Wang. However, since Wangye is willing to visit her and has done many things for her, Mammy Mu should give her a push.She glanced at Side consort Hu\u2019s stomach and slowly said, \u201cSince you miss the little princess, you can take her for one night. I\u2019ll ask Yuyan to help you get things ready and you can take wet nurse Su with you.\u201dSide consort Hu immediately smiled through her tears and said: \u201cThank you, Mammy Mu.\u201dIn the east room, Yaoniang was giving the little princess a massage and naturally heard the movement outside.This was the first time she heard the side consort Hu\u2019s cry. To be honest, Yaoniang was so surprised as if she saw a beast, because she thought side consort Hu was always been arrogant. Even if Jin Wang doted on Yaoniang in the previous life, side consort Hu never showed any white feather.Yuyan walked in and whispered to Yaoniang that she needs to go to Liuchun Pavilion tonight.Yaoniang is just a wet nurse. She could only obey.In fact, there is nothing to pack. After giving birth to the little princess, side consort Hu deliberately ordered servants to clean the west room and separately prepared a room with everything necessary for her. She wanted to keep her daughter by her side.Instead the little princess was brought to the small lateral courtyard and many things were prepared for her again. Things prepared in the west room before were never used so they just need to bring the little princess over.However, Yuyan still helped Yaoniang pack some diapers and toys up for the little princess. Then Yaoniang cradled the little princess and followed side consort Hu to Liuchun Pavilion.It is very clean and spotless in the west room and all things prepared for the little princess are put in order. The rosewood cabinet facing the corner is filled with various small toys. Some of them were not even available in the market (yet).Some toys were prepared by side consort Hu herself and some were sent by consort Jin. Of course, some toys were collected by Jin Wang from all over.Jin Wang seriously loves this daughter very much.The maidservants in the Liuchun Pavilion are also very attentive to Yaoniang. They address wet nurse Su beaming with joy all over their face. In her previous life, they treated Yaoniang indifferently and laughed at her in Liuchun Pavilion. So she was surprised because she never saw them treat her this way (in this manner).She was surprised but not dumbfounded. After all, this life is very different from the previous.Yaoniang didn\u2019t see Cuizhu but she knew why. ly, Cuizhu was punished with standing still under the sun for more than an hour. She suffered from heatstroke and couldn\u2019t get out of bed.Everyone in the small lateral courtyard knew about this and had also discussed it. Naturally, Yaoniang also knew.It has been a hundred days since the little princess was born and she is no longer willing to stay alone anymore. She always looks around while being held by the maids. She is interested in everything given by others. Even a rattle drum could attract her attention for half a day.Yaoniang put a rattle drum in her hand. The little princess often exercises her grasping ability these days so she could take it securely and shake it in her hand to make a thumping sound \u2018bang, bang, bang\u2019.The little princess couldn\u2019t help but squint and then look at the toy in her hand again. She bursts into laughter and waved it even more .Everyone in the Liuchun Pavilion, including side consort Hu, naturally laughed as well. The merriment in the Liuchun Pavilion swept away the heavy atmosphere from before.Side consort Hu didn\u2019t stay for a long time but hurried out with others.Yaoniang wondered if she will head to Zhaohui Hall.Would Jin Wang come?Of course, Jin Wang would come.Inexplicably, Yaoniang understands this.In Zhaohui Hall, Jin Wang is reading some confidential letters in the inner study room.Fucheng walked in lightly with almost no noise.Jin Wang still looked up at him. Fucheng reported, \u201cWangye, side consort Hu is waiting outside the door.\u201dJin Wang frowned.Fucheng stooped halfway and continued: \u201cSide consort Hu went to the small lateral courtyard. With Mammy Mu\u2019s consent, she took the little princess to stay overnight at Liuchun Pavilion.\u201dSo naturally it went without saying that Jin Wang also understood side consort Hu\u2019s intention.\u201cSide consort Hu invites you to have dinner at Liuchun Pavilion tonight.\u201dSilence fell in the room. Jin Wang continued to read the confidential letter in his hand.Afterwards, he frowned but didn\u2019t lift up his head, \u201cLet her go back. I will go there tonight.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dUpon hearing the words of Jin Wang, side consort Hu\u2019s face lit up with happiness.Fucheng looked at her departing figure and sighed.Sometimes she\u2019s stupid but other times she\u2019s smart on trivial matters. At least side consort Hu knows some of Jin Wang\u2019s thoughts and also understands what she is relying on.No matter whether living well or not, relying on someone or something is important for surviving in this world.Fucheng dusted the corners of his sleeves and squinted at the distant sky.Darkness has fallen, yet Liuchun Pavilion is brightly lit.The maids are all well-dressed with a happy smile on their faces.In the room, side consort Hu is already holding the little princess in her arms. She is dressed in a pristine manner today. She had a watery-red silk summer top on and wearing light-coloured makeup. She didn\u2019t wear any jewelry except for a simple jade hairpin in her bun.Nobody has seen side consort Hu this way before. She is less dazzling and beautiful but looks very tender and demure.The little princess in her arms is wearing red clothes made of cotton, the style is simple but the texture is soft. She wears a bellyband of the same color, which makes her look white and cute.Yaoniang took the time to sew these clothes for her.It\u2019s not suitable for a baby girl to wear clothes with too many patterns on a hot day. Those clothes look gorgeous but are not suitable for such a little baby, the fabric may hurt her skin. So Yaoniang tried to make a nice and breathable set which would not scratch the delicate skin of the little princess. Even if the weather is hot, the little princess neither gets heat rashes nor catches cold. Mammy Mu simply allowed Yaoniang to do what she wants.Side consort Hu smiled and praised Yaoniang that she took care of the little princess well and all maidservants nearby naturally followed.Yaoniang felt she is living in a dream. People who previously looked at her fiercely and talked boisterously completely changed their faces in this life, which really makes her have the illusion of \u201cthings still being there but the humans are no longer the same\u201d.A little girl rushed in and announced that Wangye arrived.Side consort Hu immediately held up the little princess and led a large group of people to welcome him outside.In the courtyard, the glazed palace lanterns are lit under the eaves of the veranda, which illuminated all around even the bright moon and stars in the sky are dim.Jin Wang is wearing a dark blue robe embroidered with dark patterns. He approached the place with one hand behind his back. Fucheng following right behind.Under the light, Jin Wang looked eloquent and handsome like a god from the heavens.Yaoniang saw side consort Hu lose her breath for a few minutes and then went to greet him with a bit of delight on her face.\u201cWangye.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Perhaps she also knew that her father is coming.\u201dThe little princess is indeed really happy. She slept in the afternoon. After waking up, with so many people accompanying her to play she is still extremely excited. Since her small body is still a little soft, she needs the help of an adult to get up. Side consort Hu hung her up in the air causing her to lose support. Side consort Hu\u2019s movement was too abrupt, propelling the little princess\u2019 upper body to suddenly fall to the side.Everyone was startled.They were not afraid of the little princess falling but that the action would hurt her waist.Yaoniang, standing next to Side consort Hu, reacted the fastest. She subconsciously stepped forward and supported the little princess from the side.Side consort Hu got scared and her face turned pale.She didn\u2019t expect this to happen. Lacking the experience of taking care of a child and eager to please Jin Wang, she forgot to support the little princess\u2019 body.Jin Wang\u2019s face immediately stiffened.Fortunately, the little princess didn\u2019t cry. Such small Baby doesn\u2019t understand yet what it means to be afraid. She thought that the adult was playing with her. Holding Yaoniang\u2019s hand, she made a lovely sound.Such a lovely little princess naturally pleased Jin Wang. Side consort Hu was relieved. She knew that she was not good at this. She took advantage of the situation and pushed the little princess into Yaoniang\u2019s arms and followed Jin Wang into the house.After entering the room, Side consort Hu first accommodated Jin Wang to sit on the Arhat Bed and then sat opposite him.The rest all withdrew but Yaoniang could only stay in the room because of the little princess.Yaoniang is on pins and needles. She feels very weird at this moment.The man who she served in her previous life is sitting opposite her former enemy, while she is holding their child.Inexplicably, Yaoniang felt very uncomfortable in her heart.However, she did not have time to think about anything because Side consort Hu started talking to Jin Wang regarding the little princess. As the person holding the little princess, she has to be attentive.For example, when Side consort Hu said that the little princess is getting fat recently, she has to show the chubby princess to Jin Wang; when Side consort Hu said the little princess is now naughty, she has to talk of some naughty things the little princess did.Probably, due to how deeply affected she was by what transpired in the past life, her expression was extremely reluctant. Meanwhile, the little princess likely got tired and is no longer willing to cooperate. She turned her head and rubbed her face on Yaoniang\u2019s chest more than once.The act of the little princess made Yaoniang extremely embarrassed. Since everyone\u2019s attention was focused on the little princess, they naturally stared at that place.Even Jin Wang glanced at her.Yaoniang blushed rapidly. She could not wait to bury her face in the arms of the little princess in order to deceive herself that this is not a big deal.For all these things, the little baby girl knew nothing.Because she couldn\u2019t have breast milk, the little princess was distressed. She struggled in Yaoniang\u2019s arms, rubbing her face on her chest and even crying softly.Yaoniang\u2019s high-strung nerves, coupled with the suggestive action of the little princess and her crying caused some reaction on Yaoniang. It was just a few moments before all the cloth on her chest were soaked.All of this seems slow when described but it actually happened instantly.Yaoniang naturally felt the abnormality of her body. Her mind had gone blank and she was embarrassed. However, she also knew that she couldn\u2019t continue this way any longer, so she hugged the little princess close to block her chest. She muttered, \u201cThe little princess seems to be hungry.\u201d Meanwhile, she dare not even look up.Side consort Hu\u2019s attention has always been on Jin Wang so she did not notice something was going on in Yaoniang\u2019s side. Upon hearing this, she said, \u201cSince she\u2019s hungry, take her out now.\u201dAs if she received amnesty, she held the little princess in her arms and went out immediately.After she entered the inner room, she could still feel a gaze on her back.Yaoniang remembered something in her previous life.Because of this, she was still thinking wildly when she fed the little princess.Looking at the baby who is sucking happily in her arms, somehow this little baby\u2019s face turned into an adult\u2019s face.She pondered a lot\u2026\u2026on a lot of things from her previous life.Yaoniang felt a special sense of shame. Even if she had been actively climbing the bed to serve Jin Wang in the past, after all, she was born from a respectable family. Even if the experience from her previous life changed her, knew that a woman\u2019s body is actually a tool and also understood the joy between the bed sheets, she did not expect that the harmful influence of her previous life was so deep. Recalling these messy thoughts, she could even \u2026Yaoniang covered her face with one hand and felt like she was about to burn. Fortunately, there is no one in the room; otherwise she would be so ashamed that she would find an opening to seal.The little princess has fallen asleep. Yaoniang stood up lightly to put her in a stroller before she sat down on the soft bed next to the window.It is very quiet in the room, even the whole Liuchun Pavilion is silent.Yaoniang is familiar with this kind of silence because every time Jin Wang went to the small lateral courtyard in the previous life, it was also this quiet.What are Jin Wang and Side consort Hu doing now?They\u2019re probably having dinner. After dinner, they naturally have to rest.Would Jin Wang sleep with Side consort Hu? Could Side consort Hu bear his passionate side (his passion)?After all\u2013Yaoniang suddenly felt that she shouldn\u2019t think like this anymore. Leave the past in the past. Since she didn\u2019t plan to go the same route, she shouldn\u2019t think about these dilemmas. What she needs to do is to survive and then go home in two years.She would stay with Xiaobao and raise him as an adult. Maybe she could open a small grocery store. The shop\u2019s income should be enough for her to support their sustenance\u2026 She would send Xiaobao to study. As long as the child wants to study, she would support him. Perhaps one day he could be an official and she can enjoy a happy life relying on her son and daughter-in-law.After thinking about it, Yaoniang calmed down immediately. Those charming and gentle things are like a small stone that dropped in the lake, it stirred up a ripple and then disappeared.Yaoniang felt her wet chest but she had no change of clothes. She couldn\u2019t help but regret that she did not bring any clothes when she came over. She was so muddled that she even forgot to put a piece of handkerchief on her chest when she fed the little princess.She found a piece of handkerchief and wiped the chest area of her clothes. It didn\u2019t help at all. In addition, it\u2019s a little stuffy in the room. Yaoniang (She) opened the window.The night is charming despite no wind blowing.The lights in the courtyard are still so bright, the courtyard itself is silent. Although there iare no servants, a lot of guards are standing still in the courtyard.Yaoniang is familiar with these people in uniform. They are the personal guards beside Jin Wang.She just glanced at them a few times.She thought the night might be long.Meanwhile, dinner has been served in the East room.There are many delicious food but only two people are sitting at the table.Side consort Hu did not let others serve the meals. She personally served Jin Wang instead.Although Jin Wang put on a cold face, he did not refuse the food served by Side consort Hu. She became even more attentive. She actively took dishes and poured wine for Jin Wang.Jin Wang drank two glasses of wine. Seeing that the atmosphere was not bad, Side consort Hu finally dared to boost her courage. She said with some grievances and pout, \u201cWangye, please don\u2019t blame me. I was stupid that day\u2026\u201dIt can be said that Side consort Hu is very good at pleasing people.Especially a man.Maybe she is talented or she experienced it. She knew what a woman should do in order to win the love and affection of a man.She planned well and did a good job. From holding the little princess, to how she dressed and acted, she carefully arranged all things. Unfortunately, she misjudged Jin Wang\u2019s nature.It was only when Jin Wang saw more of this that he realized how deliberate Side consort Hu\u2019s actions were and for what purpose.Actually, Jin Wang didn\u2019t care about the purpose but obviously the events of that day influenced him too much. Heaven knows that the reason why he could sit here is more like a kind of self-abuse restraint.This restraint Jin Wang had since he was a child. He grew up in a cannibalistic palace without any protection from his family. Although he is a prince, he is not qualified to be willful. In order to stand out from all the other princes and to create more opportunities for himself, he must suppress his nature and exercise restraint for a long time. This restraint had become almost his instinct.Jin Wang did not speak, he held a wine bottle in his hand but did not drink.Side consort Hu bit her lower lip and sobbed to beg him: \u201cPlease think about our daughter, the little princess is so cute\u2026\u201dYes, the little princess.This is why Jin Wang came here tonight.Everything that Jin Wang did was not for the woman in front of him but for the little princess, his only bloodline.He could give Side consort Hu the fame, his favour and everything that she could rely on to stand up to consort Jin as an equal. Unfortunately, she is more and more disappointing. Maybe he never had hope for her.Jin Wang looked at Side consort Hu.The woman in front of him who applied light make-up is completely different from the previous Side consort Hu. Jin Wang is a person of good memory. The more beautiful and refined Side consort Hu is today, the more profound Jin Wang\u2019s memory about how rude and ignorant she is.Seriously speaking, it had been extremely rare that Jin Wang would tolerate her for more than a year. He never had a disposition where he will waste his energy on irrelevant people.\u201cSince you understand all this, you should remain in your proper place.\u201d Jin Wang said quietly.Side consort Hu\u2019s face paled in an instant. Remain in her proper place? What did he mean?Jin Wang put down the wine cup and stood up, \u201cRemember your station. As for what you should and shouldn\u2019t do, I won\u2019t say it again.\u201dThen Jin Wang left. Side consort Hu wanted to chase after him but was stopped by Fucheng.\u201cSide consort, please stay.\u201dSide consort Hu bit her lower lip tightly and first glared at Fucheng before she looked at the disappearing back of Jin Wang.Fucheng didn\u2019t care about her. Knowing she had dispelled the idea of chasing after Wangye, he went to the West room. After a while, Yaoniang who is holding the little princess followed him out.Side consort Hu\u2019s face grew paler but thinking about what Jin Wang just said, she didn\u2019t do anything embarrassing.It doesn\u2019t matter. As long as Wangye is willing to forgive her, she would always find a chance.A slow breeze in the night came and revealed a sense of coolness.The moon hung high in the night sky with a silver glow.It is very quiet in the courtyard and several guards are standing in the darkness like statues without moving.Jin Wang walked in front. Yaoniang followed behind while Fucheng walked beside her.Yaoniang hugged the little princess tightly and looked at the back of the man not far away. Jin Wang\u2019s shadow was stretched so long that he even blocked the light in front of her. She was perplexed and since it\u2019s a little dark, she stumbled.Why did he come out? Is he going to the small lateral courtyard? Why didn\u2019t he stay? Why was it said that Jin Wang stayed at the Liuchun Pavilion but he kept appearing in the small lateral courtyard?There was too much bewilderment in Yaoniang\u2019s heart. She found that she did not know the man in front of her even though they had shared the same bed in the previous life and had done the most intimate thing.She probably never knew him.Yaoniang just lowered her head and continued walking but she forgot to look ahead and bumped into Jin Wang\u2019s body. Fortunately, Jin Wang quickly responded and immediately turned around to hold her. Otherwise, no one knows what would happen to her. Especially since Yaoniang was also holding the little princess.Yaoniang was startled. Fortunately, the little princess is sound asleep. Protected in her arms, the little princess was fine. She is still sleeping sweetly.The opposite eyes were cold like ice. Yaoniang has not been glared by Jin Wang this way before.She always saw his indifferent countenance. She often had no time to notice what he usually looked like. Usually after waking up, the room will be quiet except for his usual incense, there were nothing else.In addition to having sex, they don\u2019t talk much.\u201cIt was this servant\u2019s fault\u2026\u201d Yaoniang said apologetically.Jin Wang looked down at her.Her eyes are very dark, which make people feel uncertain, as if she would cry at any time. Her small red mouth trembled, making her seem scared. When Jin Wang looked down, he naturally saw how damp Yaoniang\u2019s chest is. Yaoniang\u2019s clothes were not dry but still stuck to her body, obviously revealing the white towering roundness.Jin Wang didn\u2019t know why he suddenly remembered that the little princess had rubbed her face on that chest. At the same time, a tender scent mixed with a slight milky aroma drifted into his nose. Immediately, the familiar heat rose in the air.Jin Wang couldn\u2019t help but frown and look up at the sky.The moon is bright and stars are few. It is only the latter half of April.Jin Wang lowered his head to glance at Yaoniang\u2019s face again. Then he turned his head and walked forward without saying anything.Fucheng whispered to Yaoniang next to him: \u201cWet nurse Su, watch your steps.\u201dYaoniang nodded.They entered the small lateral courtyard through an obscure corner door, which led to the side of the west chamber.Their return did not wake anyone up. There were no light in the small building. Fucheng first went to the west chamber to call people. Yuyan and Yucui greeted them shortly afterwards. Both of their hairs are messy, apparently they have just gotten up.They didn\u2019t say anything. They advanced into the small building and lit a candle.Jin Wang went up to the second floor, and Fucheng followed behind.Yaoniang suddenly could not understand Jin Wang.Inexplicably, she had the impression that perhaps Side consort Hu\u2019s so-called favors from Jin Wang are all fabricated. All of those deliberately created by Jin Wang.But why did Jin Wang do this?No one could answer her.The little princess is fatter than before and she smiles a lot instead of being sickly and dispirited.Mammy Mu said that Yaoniang made great contribution, therefore she is respected by people in the small lateral courtyard and even wet nurse Qian and Wang have to show her respect.It\u2019s true that Yaoniang has always been gentle. She couldn\u2019t bully people and didn\u2019t take the opportunity to go against wet nurse Qian and Wang. But she also didn\u2019t talk to them much either.After that, wet nurse Qian and Wang also knew that Yaoniang has a good temper, unlike some people who will be proud as soon as they have some achievements. No matter what they think in their mind, on the surface they treat Yaoniang well.Life became smoother in the lateral courtyard for Yaoniang. However, there were frequent incidents happening to Cuizhu in the Liuchun Pavilion.In fact, it is not a big deal. Most of them are small things, but if it is related to the master it is no longer a trivial matter.For example, Cuizhu accidentally hurt Side consort Hu while combing her hair. Of course, Side consort Hu would punish her but she just let her stand outside. A stumble may prevent a fall.The \u201coutside\u201d doesn\u2019t refer to the corridor or the shade, but under the sun. She would have her stand still for one or two hours. Although it\u2019s not too hot in the early summer, the sunshine is very strong. Standing outside for an hour or two is enough to stun a person and make her feel distressed but not take her life.What\u2019s more, when Cuizhu brought a cup of tea to Side consort Hu, if the water was too hot or too cold, there is only dissatisfaction. Generally, Side consort Hu would scold her directly to her face.Could you say Side consort Hu is wrong? After all, she is the master and you are just a servant. When the master wants to pick on servants, they can always find various reasons.Cuizhu is like a drowned mouse. The people in Liuchun Pavilion and the small lateral courtyard all knew what happened to her.No one helped Cuizhu, instead everyone said she deserved it.It is clear why people said so.Yaoniang finally understood why (even though) she has been troubled by Side consort Hu in her previous life no one was willing to help her.She asked for it. No one sympathized with Cuizhu; naturally, no one would pity her.The only difference is that Cuizhu\u2019s purpose may be impure because her situation was consort Jin\u2019s arrangement. Even if she claims she knew nothing that time, nobody would believe her.So, who made you stupid? You deserve it all!Even Yaoniang herself who had suffered the same situation in her previous life did not sympathize with Cuizhu at all. It is strange and weird.Jin Wang was not in the mansion these days. It was said that something happened in his Estate and Jin Wang took someone to deal with it.It\u2019s extremely quiet and peaceful in the mansion during this time. And Side consort Hu didn\u2019t torment Cuizhu too much. Everyone got along well.In a blink of an eye, it\u2019s already the Dragon Boat Festival. People in the mansion started to sweep the dust, spray pesticides and placed aromatic plants on the doors and windows. Maidservants who are good with needles and threads made sachets. Those who doen\u2019t know how bought a few colored silk threads and wore them on their wrists.Of course, it is necessary to eat rice dumplings during the Dragon Boat Festival and they have to prepare in advance for thousands of people in the mansion. It\u2019s impossible to complete it in one day.This kind of rice dumplings refers to those prepared in a large cauldron. The dumplings are also done separately for the small lateral courtyard.Because of its special status, people in the mansion paid more attention in the preparation. The food supplies in the small kitchen are adequate. There are five to six kinds of rice dumplings including sweet, salty, red dates, pork, shrimp, and egg yolk.Others in the small lateral courtyard are busy making rice dumplings, while Yaoniang is busy embroidering sachets.Yaoniang is good at needlework. The five poisonous creatures on the sachet are all vivid and the pattern of the five-color silk knitted on it is also beautiful. She was going to embroider one for Mammy Mu as a present and another one for the little princess for her duty. Everyone thought that she embroiders well and wanted her to make sachets for them.She couldn\u2019t reject. After all, people in the lateral courtyard respects and treated her well. So she made five or six sachets, as well as colorful bracelets, silk buns and other things.Yuyan finally told everyone to stop asking Yaoniang to make things for them.In fact, making these things didn\u2019t take much effort. She could make them during leisure time. It took five days for Yaoniang to finish these things. In addition, she made one for herself. In fact, there\u2019s two. After the things were done, Yaoniang remembered that she is no longer the concubine of Jin Wang.In the previous life, she also made a sachet embroidered with the five poisonous creatures for Jin Wang. Jin Wang didn\u2019t say anything but hung it around his waist. This was an incredible reaction from Jin Wang who was inherently introverted and indifferent, so Yaoniang always remembered and had always wanted to make another one for him.Unfortunately, she died in March.Yaoniang looked at the extra sachet. After thinking about it, she didn\u2019t put it away but tied both of them around her waist.These butterfly-shaped sachets are not big but very delicate. So even if she wears two on her waist, people will think it\u2019s proper and suitable.Yaoniang thought that since she made one more she shouldn\u2019t waste it. She\u2019ll wait for the following days when she can send something back home; she will ask someone to take it back for Xiaobao as a toy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 25": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Jin Wang Dotes on His ConcubineCH 21.3Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayOn the day of the Dragon Boat Festival, Jin Wang did not return.Consort Jin has always been a quiet person. Seeing that Jin Wang did not return, she did not even hold a banquet. She advised everyone to spend the festival in their own courtyard and delivered money and goods according to the festival rules.Every year, the Dragon Boat Festival is the most active and busiest time in Jin Wang\u2019s Mansion. It\u2019s rare for it to be so quiet. Since Wangye didn\u2019t return to the mansion and consort Jin also gave the order, everyone naturally celebrated well.In the small lateral courtyard, three tables have been set up for the banquet.Anyway, the dishes were all prepared. If it is not enough, they could take from the main kitchen and also cook by themselves. Because there are not that many people in the small lateral courtyard and no important errands, they held a banquet to celebrate the festival as soon as they closed the gate.The little princess also participated in it but she couldn\u2019t eat, so she just watched. Fortunately, she didn\u2019t know the grain (dumplings) incense at this moment, otherwise she would be eating a lot.They feasted until the night fell. Because they drank a lot of Xionghuang wine, they were all a little drunk.They cleaned up the mess together and returned to the room to rest.Yaoniang can\u2019t rest. She still has to take care of the little princess in the evening. Because she has to feed her at night, she didn\u2019t drink the Xionghuang wine.Yucui was also on night duty. Unfortunately, Yucui could not hold her drink. She just drank a few cups of wine and got drunk like a fish. Yuyan was slightly better than her but was also unable to stand. So Yaoniang has to be on night duty alone.Originally, the little princess no longer cries at night so she is not busy. She could take care of the little princess alone. Mammy Mu still felt a little uneasy so she ordered a little girl who didn\u2019t drink to rest outside to help Yaoniang at night.As long as Yaoniang calls her, she can get up. She doesn\u2019t have to be afraid of anything unexpected.All is quiet at dead of night. Only a yellow lamp is lit in the corner.Yaoniang sat in front of the Arhat Bed and looked at the little princess who is sleeping soundly. Since the little princess could turn over, she moved from the cradle to the bed to sleep. The bed is big enough for her to move without fear of falling.Under such ambience, Yaoniang\u2019s drowsiness gradually grew stronger and she could barely keep herself up. She yawned and looked at the little princess on the bed. She neither woke up nor urinated, so she moved her to the inner side and just laid down on the bed on her clothes.The weather was a little but stuffy. Since Yaoniang didn\u2019t take off her clothes, she perspired while sleeping.She woke up due to the heat. She got up, touched the little princess\u2019 diaper, and found it a little moist. So she changed her diaper again. When she laid down again, Yaoniang took off her outer shirt.In the room, there were only the little princess and her. There were no men in the whole small lateral courtyard so she was normally not afraid of being seen by others.After taking off her outer shirt and only wearing underwear, Yaoniang finally felt more comfortable.The little princess seemed to have awakened.Yaoniang reached out and took her in her arms. She opened her clothes without opening her eyes, dragged her bellyband to the side and stuffed the nipple into the mouth of the little princess.Finally getting what she wanted, the little princess was immediately pacified. She sucked with her little mouth and closed her eyes again.Both of them slept soundly.Even in the dark, Yaoniang felt someone watching her.She opened her eyes and saw the little princess sleeping deeply. But the source of gaze was behind her, so she looked back subconsciously.She saw a pair of stern and black eyes as cold as a pond. The eyes are indifferent and lonely, although bright, there is no reflection in them.It\u2019s Jin Wang\u2019s eyes. Yaoniang has only seen Jin Wang\u2019s eyes like this.She suddenly reacted. Jin Wang? Had Jin Wang returned to the mansion?When she looked down, she saw a cold face without any emotion like an iceberg of ten thousand years.Yaoniang immediately got up. Because her breasts bounced up and down heavily she was naturally embarrassed. She fell asleep with the little princess after breast feeding. She did not even pull back her clothes and \u2018her white jade rabbit\u2019 was exposed.Yaoniang almost screamed but held back. She was flustered at hiding \u2018the white jade rabbit\u2019 and hurriedly tidied up her clothes.She was only wearing her underwear, her shirt and socks were also taken off. At this time, she curled up timidly like a little sheep who encountered a hungry wolf. Apparently her extremely low posture made her look enticing.Yaoniang hugged her chest, and her two legs inside the thin silk pants were tightly intertwined.The clothes were issued by the mansion, not only the outer shirts but also the inner shirts. Mammy Mu thought Yaoniang took exceptional care of the little princess, so she sent Yaoniang two more sets of clothes. The dark color is the same as before but the material is better.The thin pants are made of silk. The texture of it is originally thin, so it makes one feel cool when worn during summer. It\u2019s fine to wear a few layers, but she only wore one layer. Under the light, it seems to be a bit transparent.With the turquoise wide-leg pants, her legs looked even more slender. Her small feet with transparent nails are slightly pink. Especially since she is curled up at this time, it made her look even more tempting.Jin Wang did not expect that this stiff wet nurse who is rigid in his impression can make such an expression! He glanced dimly at her chest and somehow remembered the scene he had just seen\u2013The pink parts are watery and shiny. An innocent little baby face is beside it.The fire in Jin Wang\u2019s body exploded and he couldn\u2019t hold it down, which made him think that it is a full moon tonight.Yaoniang was so embarrassed that she wanted to hide. She reacted quickly and grabbed the clothes on the foot of the bed and covered herself casually.\u201cWangye, please forgive this servant. It\u2019s inconvenient for this servant to give a salute at this time.\u201dJin Wang murmured in an unprecedentedly obtuse sound, \u201cI\u2019ve come to see the little princess.\u201d\u201cThe little princess is good\u2026\u201dJin Wang nodded and paused for a bit then left.Yaoniang didn\u2019t dare to delay and quickly put on her clothes and shoes to follow.Jin Wang had gone away. Fucheng\u2019s back disappeared at the corner of the second floor and the little girl Xiangxiang was sleeping sweetly.Yaoniang shook her head. The little girl is too young. She couldn\u2019t be compared with other maids like Yuyan, her vigilance is quite inferior. Thinking of herself, she is no better than her.Meanwhile, she breathed a sigh of relief and stood in the hall briefly and then went back to the inner room.It is very quiet in the room. The arrival of Jin Wang did not even wake the little princess up, she still slept soundly.Yaoniang blushed. When she thought of the situation just now, she couldn\u2019t help but cover her face.She accidentally let him see such a scene. Would he think she was trying to seduce him intentionally? It\u2019s also due to her negligence that she made such a mistake.At the same time, Yaoniang was also confused. Why did Jin Wang stay on the second floor again? Why didn\u2019t he go back to Zhaohui Hall?Yaoniang couldn\u2019t sleep after such an incident. She sat silently on the edge of the bed for a while. Suddenly, there is a sound of footsteps outside. As soon as Yaoniang stood up, Fucheng came in.\u201cWet nurse Su, bring hot water to the second floor.\u201dYaoniang hesitated. She looked at the little princess who was asleep and back at Fucheng, \u201cThe little princess\u2026\u201d\u201cI will help you look after her.\u201d Fucheng said with a wave of his hand.Since he said so, Yaoniang could only obey. Of course she wondered why Fucheng didn\u2019t fetch the water by himself and instead asked her to. On second thought, after looking at Fucheng\u2019s status, he would have never done any rough work like boiling water so she did not doubt anymore.Yaoniang first went to the tea room to boil water. Then she filled the copper basins and took it to the second floor.Yaoniang has never been to the second floor of the small building before. The stairs are located behind the painting hanging on the wall of the main hall.She stepped on the second floor and turned to face a small hall with only one door leading to it.The door is half-covered at this time.Yaoniang entered with the basin and saw dark brown floors.The floors are clean and a dark purple woven patterned mat is laid in the middle of the room. Yaoniang couldn\u2019t recognize what the pattern is but it looks good and matches the furnishings of the room.A row of windows on one wall has a table right below. Purple tulle curtains are hanging on the window. Currently, two windows are widely opened so that the night breeze blowing in from outside stirred the curtain up and down.On the right, there is a row of antique shelf and doffing hoods. Under the dim moonlight, she could see bookshelves and book cases, as well as several round-back chairs and flower tables. On the left, there is also a row of antique shelf and doffing hoods, which are lit with candles. She could see an Eight Immortals Table and a chaise lounge under the window.Yaoniang didn\u2019t focus on these things but on the door of the half-hidden inner room, where light is streaming out.Yaoniang took a deep breath and walked over holding the basin.She couldn\u2019t hold the basin in one hand, so she could only put it on the ground and knock on the door lightly three times.\u201cCome in.\u201d It\u2019s Jin Wang\u2019s usual indifferent voice.Yaoniang pushed the door to walk in. It is a simple but elegant room. In the corner of the room, there is a three-legged incense burner with golden gliding dragons. There is a unique and special scent in the air.The scent that belongs to Jin Wang awakened Yaoniang\u2019s memory because she often woke up in the aroma of this scent in her previous life.Inexplicably, she was a little flustered. When she looked up, she saw Jin Wang sitting on the bed behind the curtain. His clothes half opened and his long hair scattered around his shoulders. She felt suffocated.Her heart pounded heavily and started to palpitate.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 26": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Jin Wang Dotes on His ConcubineCH 22Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayYaoniang is familiar with this kind of nervous feeling because she felt it every time she saw Jin Wang in her previous life.She has analyzed the reason but only drew in conclusion that Jin Wang is too handsome.There is no doubt that Jin Wang is handsome. He is the handsomest man Yaoniang has ever seen.He is too handsome that Yaoniang would dare not look at him again.Yaoniang lowered her head and whispered, \u201cWangye, water has been brought over.\u201d\u201cDo the duty of washing my feet.\u201dYaoniang was shocked for a moment. But she did not dare refute and walked over carrying the basin.The temperature of the water was just right. Jin Wang already took off his shoes and settled his bare feet on the footrest. Yaoniang held his soles with one hand while the other held his calves. Then she put Jin Wang\u2019s feet in the basin.Jin Wang\u2019s feet look good, white and strong. His nails are regularly trimmed except for some thin callouses on the soles. Yaoniang could do these things well. Strictly speaking, she learned it in order to please Jin Wang and convince him to sleep in her room in the previous life.For example, she knows how to make Jin Wang feel comfortable and which acupuncture points would relieve fatigue.She seems to please him subconsciously.Yaoniang poured water on Jin Wang\u2019s legs and feet with one hand while touching his calves with the other. Jin Wang\u2019s calf muscles are too knotted to be pressed, which must be the result of long period of horse riding.Yaoniang sighed in her heart and stroked his calves with her hand. She started to press them with her fingers where his muscles were a little softer.She massaged his calves back and forth carefully from top to bottom.Yaoniang did not make it seem her first time washing Jin Wang\u2019s feet. She was so familiar with it, which made it seem as if she has done it countless times.Jin Wang had this feeling but it didn\u2019t prevent him from feeling complacent.It was really comfortable. It seemed that all the discomfort on his legs and feet were extracted. This time Jin Wang returned from outside riding a horse all day. He is used to riding horses rather than taking a carriage.Then, Jin Wang looked down at Yaoniang.She has white cheeks and curled eyelashes. He could see nothing else from this angle because she wrapped herself with tight clothes.Jin Wang could not help but frown. He no longer felt the wet nurse was deliberately trying to seduce him. If she had that kind of thought, it\u2019s impossible for her to be wearing clothes like this.Is she perhaps purposely taking another approach to display her unique self? There is no doubt that Jin Wang couldn\u2019t help but always think of that beautiful scene.The original reason why Jin Wang deliberately called Yaoniang here was that he didn\u2019t vomit.Maybe the scene was too shocking or he walked away in a hurry but Jin Wang didn\u2019t realize until he reached the second floor. In order to test whether it was true, he asked Fucheng to go down to fetch water for him and specifically mentioned the wet nurse.Fucheng is astute. He certainly understood what was implied.Sure enough, she went.Fucheng walked back and forth downstairs but still couldn\u2019t restrain the excitement.Wangye actively wants a woman?As long as he thought of it, tears would flow from his aged eyes.Would they\u2026 or wouldn\u2019t?These two thoughts rolled back and forth in his mind like a pot of boiling water.Fucheng listened very carefully for fear of missing a trace of movement. What he was most afraid of was that wet nurse would run down with tears and Wangye would become furious.But there has been no movement even now. Just as Fucheng grew more anxious, he suddenly heard a slight footstep. He immediately picked up the hem of his robe and ran away; taking on the same energy he had when he was a little eunuch.Upstairs, Yaoniang felt more and more nervous. Although she had her head lowered, she could feel him lay his eyes on her head.She is no stranger to this kind of gaze but even quite familiar with it.In retrospect, every time Jin Wang looked at her with this kind of gaze he would always\u2026Yaoniang was stunned. At the same time, she felt an uncontrollable numbness come up from her lower vertebrae, as if she was lit on fire. Her chest swelled, which seemed to protrude. With a slight tingling sensation, Yaoniang could even hear the sizzling sound.She sprung up on reflex. Shielding her chest, she fell to the side as her legs were weak.Jin Wang was a little embarrassed by her actions and subconsciously wanted to reach out to pull her up but she hurriedly got up from the ground while blocking his hands.Under the light, she blushed as if on fire. She lowered her eyes with her arms clenched tightly around her chest but her eyelashes trembled uncontrollably: \u201cIt seems that the little princess is crying. I should go\u2026\u201dAfter saying this, she didn\u2019t give Jin Wang a chance to react at all. She turned around and ran away.Jin Wang\u2019s feet were left in the water basin and his hands stiffened in the air. For a long time he did not come to his senses.As soon as Fucheng came out, he saw Yaoniang come downstairs.There were no tears, snot or disheveled clothes. But her eyes were watery and face flushed as if she had just washed her face or was just doted on by Wangye.Fucheng couldn\u2019t help but clear his throat. Seeing that Yaoniang was frightened, he concluded that Yaoniang was really timid.\u201cWet nurse Su, did you serve Wangye well?\u201dYaoniang was shocked. Why did this sound so strange?Yaoniang is no stranger to Fucheng. Although Fucheng is the main Eunuch in the mansion, he actually serves Jin Wang personally. Every time Jin Wang came to the courtyard in her previous life, she would see him. But in her impression, he always seemed to be smiling gently. Now he suddenly changed. To be honest, Yaoniang couldn\u2019t accept this.She always felt that his gentle expression revealed some peculiarity.\u201cWangye has fallen asleep.\u201d Yaoniang relatively chose a less strange statement.When he heard this, his eyes lit up immediately and he nodded again and again with a smile on his face: \u201cYou worked hard today, go and have a good rest.\u201dHe thought that wet nurse Su is so honest that she would still continue with her duty like this. Simultaneously, he felt that their time together was too short. Wasn\u2019t Wangye vigorous enough?In short, Fucheng was full of strange ideas in his mind at this moment and he could not wait to rush up to see the satisfied look of Wangye undressed and completely stripped naked.However, in the end he is prudent. He nodded again to Yaoniang before walking upstairs taking relatively slow steps.Yaoniang thought of something in her mind. Even if she was a little perplexed, she didn\u2019t have much time to think about it but hurried inside the room.The little princess was still asleep on the bed in the west room. Yaoniang sighed and then went behind the folding screen.There was a basin with water behind the screen. She immediately immersed her face in cold water.Yaoniang was known as a gorgeous beauty since childhood.There are two daughters and one son in Su\u2019s family. Yaoniang was not treated that well at home unlike her older brother, Su Yucheng, but it didn\u2019t make much difference because she earned enough face for her mother.Whenever they visited relatives, everyone would say that Yaoniang is pretty. Neighbors envied mother Wu who gave birth to such a beautiful daughter.Yaoniang got her period as early as eleven years old. And then she had undergone tremendous changes. Her small breast was higher day by day and the buttocks were getting more and more curved. Her originally small beautiful face steadily becomes more charming. Gradually the attitude of outsiders towards her also changed.Yaoniang heard the eldest lady in the same alley tell her mother more than once that she would have endless blessings from her daughter alone and the good days of the Su family all relied on her.It\u2019s nothing if they said that once or twice but everyone said so. Plus some people were bound to say atrocious words. Gradually the implied meanings changed.What kind of family are the Su\u2019s? It is good to say that it is a family of scholars but it is actually poor.The daughter from such family is destined to marry no good people. The rich and noble family would disdain her. Although poor families without power want to marry her, not to mention scholar Su, even mother Wu wouldn\u2019t agree.After all, Yaoniang was foretold to have a good fortune of becoming the wife of a grand official in the future.Mother Wu knows that her daughter is a night pearl among the pile of rocks, so she couldn\u2019t bear to let her be dirtied. Of course, these are all in the mind of the Su family. Outsiders don\u2019t know anything.In this case, what could outsiders expect?It\u2019s obvious that Yaoniang would marry a rich person as a concubine in the future and then take good care of her own family in return.What Scholar Su cares most about is face and identity; otherwise, outsiders wouldn\u2019t say that the Su family is poor and pedantic. Guided by this kind of thinking, the Su family is more or less aloof from politics and material pursuits; therefore, mother Wu couldn\u2019t accept outsiders\u2019 words that her daughter is going to be a concubine.What\u2019s more, a mother is also reluctant to let her daughter become a concubine.For this matter, mother Wu cried more than once.At that time, Yaoniang was too young to understand these things. She only knew that because of her appearance, outsiders always talked about her family and looked at her with those kinds of flickering ambiguous eyes. Gradually, she went out less and less, and began to pay more attention to the way she dress. It\u2019s common for a girl her age to inevitably wear beautiful clothes or apply some make-up, but she never liked to do these things.Yaoniang firmly insisted on not becoming someone\u2019s concubine even if she couldn\u2019t get married for a lifetime.Unfortunately, too many unexpected things happened later, so she had to unwillingly embark on a loathsome path in order to survive.When she became a concubine, Yaoniang knew that she is just a man\u2019s toy.She heard gossips about her in the mansion. Some were nice while some were not pleasant to hear.Good words contain some flattering words while the bad words made her often depressed and unable to let go. Some people said she is a wily fox, a bitch that is too sex-starved to live without a man.At that time, in order to please Consort Jin, Yaoniang fought with side consort Hu. She did not scheme but held the source from the root, which was to keep Jin Wang in her room.In order to achieve this goal, she tried everything she could. Side consort Hu tried to trip her up. So many rumors began to spread slowly in the mansion.She naturally heard of these gossips.She was ashamed and annoyed at that time. She hated side consort Hu in her heart. Although she later learned that it was a ploy used by side consort Hu to disgust her, she still kept it in mind for two lifetimes.In her previous life, Yaoniang was not willing to admit this kind of dirty rumors. She would get upset whenever she remembered this. Now, however, she couldn\u2019t lie to herself anymore.It is not the first time but it is more obvious now that her body actually responds to Jin Wang\u2019s gaze.Sure enough, like what others said, she is\u2026She picked up a handkerchief on the basin stand and wiped her face casually, and then she exhaled strenuously.Until then, the feeling of shame makes her want to dig deep into the ground and completely disappear.She didn\u2019t want to think about why Jin Wang looked at her that way. In short, in this life, she would definitely not go the same route.She doesn\u2019t believe Jin Wang would force her, the wet nurse of the little princess. Moreover, she also knew he is not a man who would force a woman.On the other side, Fucheng went to the second floor. Seeing that it was quiet inside, he slightly hesitated and entered.He imagined that he might see some kind of scene but he didn\u2019t expect to see his Highness\u2019 trouser legs rolled all the way up to his knees and his feet soaking in the basin. Jin Wang seemed to be mulling over something.He didn\u2019t know what he was thinking.Water basin? Soaked feet?Perhaps he just thought too much?But if he thought too much, why would wet nurse Su look like that?Fucheng hasn\u2019t returned to the present and suddenly heard Jin Wang ask, \u201cHas An Rong woken up?\u201dFucheng didn\u2019t know what he meant but subconsciously answered, \u201cThe little princess is sleeping very well.\u201dJin Wang slightly narrowed his eyes. This little wet nurse is so bold that she dare lie to him!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Why doesn\u2019t Mammy Mu\u00a0let me take on night\u00a0duty?\u201dYuyan who was cleaning\u00a0the bed didn\u2019t raise her head\u00a0and said, \u201cYou cannot always be on night duty. Recently, the little princess sleeps well so it\u2019s improper to let you stay up all night alone.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201dYuyan patted the soft pillow and placed it on the bedside.\u00a0Then she\u00a0stood up straight\u00a0and looked at her helplessly: \u201cI\u2019m not criticizing you. You are too honest. Those two don\u2019t say anything\u00a0but you still hold your tongue. They work during the day and take care of the little princess together with some maidservants beside\u00a0them. But you are always placed on night duty and still help massage the belly of\u00a0the little princess during the day. You work so hard. So I just talked to Mammy Mu and have you, wet nurse Qian and wet nurse Wang take turns in caring\u00a0for the little princess. Then you\u2019ll be on day duty and they will be on night duty.\u201d\u201cActually I\u2019m fine.\u00a0I like to work at night\u2026\u201dYuyan turned around and smiled at her, apparently she didn\u2019t believe her words.Yes.\u00a0Who would want to\u00a0stay up late\u00a0and not even sleep well at night?On the surface, Yaoniang didn\u2019t care. Yuyan sat on the edge of the bed and said to her, \u201cIn fact, it\u2019s not just because of you. The little princess cried in the middle of the night the past few days,\u00a0which disturbed a lot of people. There was\u00a0no way to avoid it and everyone could\u00a0only stay\u00a0up late\u00a0together. Now if only you are on\u00a0night\u00a0duty, Yucui and\u00a0I must take turns to accompany you. Although there is only one master in the yard, there are actually a lot of things to do. Mammy Mu is getting older and she wasn\u2019t in charge a long time ago. We can\u2019t tire her too much. So if you three alternate on night duty,\u00a0Yucui and I\u00a0can\u00a0rest.\u201dExpressing it this way, Yaoniang couldn\u2019t say anything else.Could\u00a0she say that she really didn\u2019t want to be on duty during the day?In the past few days,\u00a0Jin Wang would frequently come to the small lateral courtyard. Even if Yaoniang generally slept in the room during the day, she heard the maidservants say that Jin Wang\u00a0came\u00a0more than once.In an odd way, her conscience felt\u00a0guilty.She remembered that day she used her quick wits in her predicament. She made up an excuse that the little princess was crying and ran away in a hurry. Fucheng was downstairs at that time. Was Jin Wang aware that she lied to him?Yaoniang wondered if\u00a0Jin\u00a0Wang\u00a0is going to punish her but this is totally unreasonable. Jin Wang, as the\u00a0most powerful person in the entire Jin Wang Mansion, could certainly\u00a0punish her for her deceit and even kick\u00a0her out. It is\u00a0really not so difficult.Remembering the eyes of Jin\u00a0Wang\u00a0that day, Yaoniang felt perhaps\u00a0he had some\u00a0intentions towards her.After reconsidering\u00a0it, how could Jin Wang\u2013such an important person\u2013care about a widow, someone\u00a0who lost her husband?It\u2019s not\u00a0that Yaoniang is self-degrading herself, but his wife and concubines\u00a0in the\u00a0backyard were all gorgeous. Everyone was better than her regarding appearances and personalities.She couldn\u2019t figure this out. She could only give up thinking too much. Perhaps she would know\u00a0when the right\u00a0time comes.As soon as things have been settled, Yaoniang had\u00a0day duty. Although there were a lot of things during the day, it was\u00a0much easier than staying\u00a0up all\u00a0night.When she went on day duty for the first time, Jin Wang\u00a0did not appear.She actually felt that she thought too much.But\u00a0Jin\u00a0Wang\u00a0came on the second day.The little princess just fell asleep. This was\u00a0the proper time for her to sleep. She\u00a0rubbed her eyes\u00a0a few times\u00a0with her small white\u00a0hands\u00a0and Yaoniang realized\u00a0she was feeling sleepy. Holding the little princess in her arms, she walked\u00a0back and forth to coax\u00a0her.\u00a0In\u00a0a blink of an eye,\u00a0the little princess\u00a0fell asleep. Yucui was bragging about Yaoniang\u2019s ability to coax a child\u00a0to sleep. It would take a long time for wet nurses Qian and Wang to coax the little princess to sleep.Suddenly they heard a voice in the courtyard.\u00a0It seemed that Jin Wang arrived. The two rushed out to greet him.Sure enough, it is\u00a0Jin Wang.Today,\u00a0Jin\u00a0Wang looked\u00a0surprisingly handsome.\u00a0Wearing a robe\u00a0embroidered with an image of sunshine after the rain and\u00a0a sapphire crown on his head, Jin\u00a0Wang\u00a0was\u00a0particularly spectacular like a cloud or fog on top of the mountains or a\u00a0wave\u00a0in\u00a0the sea.Yaoniang was stunned\u00a0for a bit and then immediately\u00a0made a deep curtsy\u00a0alongside Yucui.Jin Wang\u00a0walked inside the room with Fucheng following behind.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 28": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Jin Wang Dotes on His ConcubineCH 23.2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cThe little princess just fell asleep. Mammy Mu is in the east room.\u201d Yucui said respectfully to Jin Wang.Jin Wang nodded and glanced at the little princess. Actually, instead of looking at the little princess, Yaoniang felt that he was looking at her. Strangely enough, she felt that he took a glance at her for a moment longer.Yaoniang was nervous and rigidly lowered her eyes.Jin Wang looked pale and nodded to Yucui then turned away.He did not leave but went to the second floor.In this regard, Yucui was not surprised.Because the second floor was arranged for Jin Wang, he would come over from time to time; although he often came at night. She was hesitant to send a cup of tea to him. No one is allowed to causally go to the second floor without orders.Fucheng walked in while Yucui was speaking to Yaoniang about this.\u201cWet nurse Su, go and make a cup of tea for Wangye. Silver Needle (a kind of yellow tea), don\u2019t make a mistake.\u201dFucheng\u2019s words not only surprised Yucui but also made Yaoniang very confused because generally it was impossible to order a wet nurse to do this.But since Fucheng said it, Yaoniang didn\u2019t dare to refute. So she had to make tea and take it to the second floor.Looking at Fucheng who seemed to have no intention to go upstairs and spoke with Yucui instead with a smile, Yaoniang had a bad feeling in her heart.Sure enough, she went up and saw Jin Wang sitting behind the writing desk with a gloomy look.She had no idea of whether it\u2019s just her imagination or something, although Jin Wang was reading a book instead of looking at her, she felt he had eyes on his forehead.Yaoniang have butterflies in her stomach. She couldn\u2019t help but want to touch her hair and clothes. It\u2019s a pity that both her hands were occupied with holding the tea tray and she could only awkwardly carry the tea over.As she got closer and closer to Jin Wang, a fine layer of sweat beads appeared on Yaoniang\u2019s forehead and nose. She was so anxious that she set the tea cup lightly on the table. The closer she is to Jin Wang, the more she felt how tall he is. She was standing while he sat, but they had the same height.Seeing that Jin Wang did not move, Yaoniang was relieved.When Yaoniang was about to step back, she heard Jin Wang cough lightly.She shivered subconsciously. Her hands twisted together and clenched tightly.Jin Wang did not need to raise his eyes to see her thin white fingers. A picture suddenly appeared in his mind\u2014That day she washed his feet slowly.\u201cDo you have something to say?\u201dShe felt bitterness in her mouth and thought what will be will be.However, this did not upset her. He really remembered that she had deceived him, instead of the other\u2026Her voice was weak: \u201cPlease forgive me, Wangye. On that day, I didn\u2019t deliberately deceive you. It was my mistake that I seemed to have heard the little princess cry. But after I came down, I found out the little princess didn\u2019t cry. This slave is at fault.\u201dWasn\u2019t this a confession without duress?\u201cWhat have you done wrong?\u201d\u201cThat day, I shouldn\u2019t go away without finishing my job. I shouldn\u2019t be afraid of being punished when I didn\u2019t go back to the second floor after I found out that the little princess didn\u2019t wake up.\u201d\u201cSo can you be forgiven?\u201dYaoniang nodded quickly.Jin Wang looked at her.Today, the wet nurse was even more old-fashioned. She was wearing wide sandalwood clothes without any shape. Her formerly smooth forehead was completely hidden under the bangs she deliberately made.According to the customs of the Qian Dynasty, married women can\u2019t wear bangs.In order to deliberately get the bangs, she actually covered her forehead with hair and fixed it with hair oil. Maybe because this kind of bangs was not easy to have, she smeared a lot of hair oil on this layer of bangs.At first glance, she looked like a woman doing odds and ends in the kitchen. But after seeing her kind of beauty, Jin Wang clearly remembered it.He felt it was just recklessly wasting God\u2019s good gifts.Jin Wang was a little surprised by his own thoughts for he always felt before that the woman\u2019s body is disgusting. He would have not thought of that kind of thing at all but he repeatedly made an exception for this little wet nurse.It was because of these abnormalities that Jin Wang decided to figure out the truth of this matter.\u201cIf you want me not to blame you\u2026\u201d Jin Wang said slowly.Yaoniang froze for a moment.\u201cTake off your clothes.\u201dUh?Yaoniang was so surprised that she even forgot that there is differences between the poor and nobles. She looked at Jin Wang in surprise. Her small white face was clear and her little red mouth opened slightly as if she saw some wonders.Jin Wang is not a crude person. Seriously, he was reticent and pretty decent. After all, he was born noble and wealthy. He unexpectedly spoke out these words to tease good woman, which was scarier than seeing someone run naked on the street.Anyway, Yaoniang had slept with Jin Wang so many times in her previous life. He said so many ambiguous words a few times when he was muddled on the bed. By the time he got out of bed, he became serious and indifferent like a deity untouched by dust.\u201cWangye, you can\u2019t be like this\u2026\u201d her mouth trembled for a long time before she said, \u201cotherwise what is the difference between you and a bully\u2026\u201dHearing this, Jin Wang lightly smiled.His smile was arrogant, contemptuous and disdainful. He laughed loudly as if he heard some big joke.Jin Wang has not done anything to violate good women but this did not mean that he did not take advantage of his power to bully others. Regarding their identity and status, the first thing they understood from birth was \u2018power\u2019. And these royal people overrode all mortal beings relying on \u2018power\u2019?Especially for Jin Wang, Consort De died while he was still young. A prince who lost his mother in the imperial palace was even worse than a servant. Since he was a child, he had learned how to use \u2018power\u2019, how to rely on this \u2018power\u2019 to deter those minions and how to obtain more \u2018power\u2019 in order to stand on the top of a cloud one day.So Jin Wang is the ancestor of all bullies considering his high status.But it really made him feel like a gangster doing all kinds of bullying, and he is really embarrassed.Jin Wang thought of how the bully on the street oppressed good people. It was not just his imagination but the funny little wet nurse behaved like it is so.It\u2019s a pity that Jin Wang thought for a while and failed to express his intention in a proper manner. He decided to give up and follow his own method.\u201cTake off your clothes. Don\u2019t let me say it again!\u201dJin Wang: You are a widow who lost her husband? Am I dead? It has been more than twenty-two chapters already. How many times have you said that I died?Yaoniang: (puts on an innocent face and didn\u2019t say anything).Jin Wang: You will know soon whether your man is already dead.10,000 words are omitted\u2026Hi, dear reader of Jin Wang Dotes on His Concubine, thanks for you staying tuned for so long time.By the way, I want to tell you a good news. One of my friend\u2019s friend checked my blog and thought it\u2019s indeed not convenient to use for readers, so he and his friends made a simple website and decided to look for a professional translation team to translate this book. They actually started to translate other books now and are going to do more translation works step by step. When the time is right, I will tell you their website.I think the update progress is too slow for readers. More than 200 chapters need several years to finish, you have to wait too long time. And I checked their translations, I think it\u2019s readable and they told me if they took over the translation, 1 chapter per one or two days can be assured.So I decided to let them keep on translating this book and as they have to stock some chapters, there will be several days without new chapters. Sorry to say this, but I believe things will get better. Believe me, this book will not be given up, you can be rest assured.And as the COVID-19 is spreading more and more severely, I wish you stay safe and sound. Nothing is more important than life. We will defeat this evil monster, be carefull, stay with your famillies at home.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Then another translator will be in charge of the rest.If you have any advice on the translation quality, updating frequency or other problems, welcome back to us. We will incorporate your suggestions to make it better.To be honest, Yaoniang was really scared, and her face turned pale.She wanted to lie on the ground subconsciously and allow Jin Wang to do what he wanted to do, but she also thought of her son-Xiao Bao.She remembered that Xiao Bao had lost his mother in the previous life, and was so lonely and helpless. He was certainly not treated well by Mrs. Li in Yao's family. Yaoniang left her son behind in her two lifetimes, so Xiao Bao was the person who she was the deepest sorry to.Xiaobao couldn't live without his mother, and she must stay alive, so she couldn't repeat the same mistakes and become the concubine of Jin Wang.At the same time, Yaoniang also had a hint of clarity in her head, and felt that she seemed to be trapped in an unconscious maze. Obviously, she came to the Mansion to be a wet nurse and her work was impeccable. On the basis of everything, she didn't think that it's right to rely on Jin Wang.She didn't sell herself to the Jin Wang Mansion, nor was she Jin Wang's concubine! She was just a wet nurse!Her previous life really made a deep influence on her, and it was not only her body, but even her mind.Yaoniang suddenly had a sense of sobriety like being enlightened. So she consciously straightened up, and stopped defensively guarding her chest, but dropped her hands naturally.Jin Wang thought that Yaoniang finally decided to obey. When he was satisfied her performance, he couldn't help but wonder if she was playing hard-to-get, did she want to seduce him?He had seen such a woman more than once. They would rather die than submit, but in fact it was just an act and all were traps.There were too many such traps in the palace, and Jin Wang didn't want to see them anymore.Suddenly he fell dispirited and didn't quite understand why he had this emotion, but he didn't want to understand it.A woman was never impossible for him to get, but he wanted her or not.If he wanted, he could get her anytime..Jin Wang even thought that if this woman could eliminate his addiction diseases. He would let her live in rich and honourable life.He treat her as the woman in Liuchun Pavilion.Jin Wang's face became stern again, but Yaoniang didn't find it all, because she looked down and seemed to be thinking about something.*For Jin Wang, it was just one word and one thing.But for Yaoniang, it would be a life upset.She was born with a docile personality, and many people used to call her a fox, but Yaoniang was a very honest and simple-minded girl.She was born in Jin Zhou and grew up in Jin Zhou.While in Jin Zhou, Jin Wang controlled everything like a King and God.His words was just like an imperial decrees for an ordinary people in Jin Zhou.Being influenced by this thought, she couldn't bear any thoughts to resist when Yaoniang entered the Jin Wang Mansion.Yaoniang couldn't resist Consort Jin,.neither did she resist Jin Wang.But this time, she didn't want to obey anymore. She had already died once, and she didn't want to die a second time.Yaoniang looked up at the man near at hand. When she saw his handsome face, she couldn't help but have a tight pupil, and feel that she could not breathe unexpectedly, which made her heart tremble.But she still had a hint of awareness, and did not forget what kind of the situation she was facing and what choice she would make.She pouted slightly and lowered her head. Her voice was trembling, but she still forced herself to speak.\"My Highness, please forgive me for not obeying your orders. I am married. Although my husband is dead, I still have a young son and do not want to remarry. The reason for coming to the Mansion is to raise him up. You are wise, brilliant, majestic and powerful, presumably you will not force a miserable and weak woman... \"Of course, Jin Wang was annoyed, but his annoyance had nothing to do with others. There might also be some anger when his dignity and status were challenged, but it was more of an embarrassment and intolerance.As a prince of the Qian Dynasty, he could have all women of the world, but now he was rejected by a wet nurse.He was rejected under this circumstance, and he imitated those bullies who were trying to bully men and women, but the other party would rather die than submit...But looking at her, his annoyance disappeared unexpectedly. Because he could see how scared she was, and her whole body was snoring.She was so pitiful.Yaoniang was really pitiful, seemingly calm, but in fact she gave a false impression and he could clearly see how nervous she was. Her little face was pale, and her hands and lips were shaking and even the thickly curled eyelashes were shaking slightly. The corner of her eyes were red, and made people feel like she was about to cry.Her words should have made people feel righteous and backboned, but let people had an illusion of begging. It was as if a little rabbit had no resistance ability, but still extended its claws without sharp nails to deter when it faced a wolf that wanted to eat itself.It made people feel funny and compassionate.Jin Wang pursed his thin lips and wanted to reprimand, but he didn't know how to speak. Could it be said that she would be wrong if she did not take off clothes. But it would be not possible for Jing Wang to admit his mistake with his character.He was so embarrassed that he could only cover up his embarrassment with a cold face and said indifferently, \"Go out.\"Yaoniang couldn't help shivering and walked out as pressing her chest.After she walked outside, she couldn't stand it anymore, and sat on the ground.She offended him.So, it might be good.*Yaoniang slowly walked downstairs. For fear that others saw her anomalies, she deliberately rubbed on her face and took a few deep breaths before going to the East Room.It was very quiet. Fucheng was not there, and Yucui sat on the edge of the bed and looked at the sleeping little princess.Seeing Yaoniang coming in, Yucui looked up at her subconsciously.\"Well, where is Eunuch Fu?\" Yaoniang asked casually.Yucui answered, \"Eunuch Fu went to the toilet.\"Yaoniang nodded and came to the bed. The little princess was still asleep. She went to the side to find some clothes that the little princess had changed, and told Yucui that she would wash them, and then hurried out with her head down.Yucui looked at her back and sighed almost silently.Fucheng felt that he was old and was really shameful to do such a thing, but it was important to his Highness..He stayed in the toilet for a long time. Even if it was as clean and tidy as the bedroom, he couldn't bear. He estimated the time in his heart and felt that it was almost the time, then he came out of the toilet. As soon as he arrived in the small building, he saw Jin Wang stepping out of the door with an indifferent face, and then he walked to Jin Wang.\"My Highness, are you going back to Zhaohui Hall?\"Jin Wang did not speak, but just strode forward.Fucheng took a glance at him, did he fail?Why didn't he succeed? Could it be said that his Highness could not fix a little wet nurse? Or did his Highness lack of experience and mess up?Fucheng thought that the latter possibility was bigger.He didn't dare to ask more, but just lowered his head and walked behind Jin Wang. Jin Wang walked very fast, and he struggled to keep up. Eventually Jin Wang stopped walking, He could not bear it any longer, and whispered, \"Should I ask Anshi to go to knock that little wet nurse dizzy and send her to my Highness' room?\"Jin Wang looked at him with indifferent eyes.His eyes were cold as ice.Fucheng shut up immediately and acted as a quail.Even though Fucheng did so, Jin Wang didn't let Fucheng go. For the next half day, Fucheng was ordered by Jin Wang to run around in the Mansion. Obviously, Jin Wang could let the servants do such a trivial matter, but Jin Wang just asked Fucheng to do.Fucheng knew that his Highness was annoyed with him, but the point was that he was also innocent.Fucheng was exhausted for a day. At night, Jin Wang announced with a hum to end the torture of Fucheng.Fucheng was old and weak, so he handed over the task of serving Jin Wang to his adopted son Xiao Shunzi, and then he came to the small lateral yard at once.He went to East Room and sat opposite Mammy Mu. He sighed and poured out his grievances for a long time.\"You mean that my Highness likes Wet Nurse Su?\" Instead of a question, but she stated a truth. In fact, Mammy Mu was a little surprised that things moved too fast.From the day when Yaoniang entered the courtyard, Mammy Mu noticed her.Compared with active Cuizhu, She was more concerned about Yaoniang who was quiet and self-effacement. Mammy Mu spent most of her life in the palace, so she knew what kind of woman could be doted. There were three thousand beauties in the imperial harem, and how many beauties could really let the emperor arise interest? And those who were doted had many advantages, such as good looks, pleasing temperament, but also such as Yaoniang, who was born to be a stunner that men couldn't resist.Mammy Mu originally thought that the girl from Xu Guogong Mansion had an unusual vision and was really a stunner. Regarding the battle between Consort Jin and Side Consort Hu, Mammy Mu knew in her heart. But she never interfered, because she had seen too many such things and did not think that this level of backyard dispute would be implicated in men.Even if there was, it would never be happened to Jin Wang. Mammy Mu took care of Jin Wang when he was young and she knew the nature and means of her little master.Mammy Mu hoped that Jin Wang would have more women. Only by this way, Jin Wang could have many children.\"But this little lady is not a virgin and has a son, will the highness not be disgusted?\"Hearing Mammy Mu's words, Fucheng's eyes flickered, and he laughed, \"My Highness will never speak this thing to us directly.\"Mammy Mu nodded, \"This is true. The Highness always has his own ideas. In fact. That's okay, it's better to be more fertile than choosing a barren land. No matter how hard you work, it won't have crops.\"Fucheng didn't say anything about this. He knew what Mammy Mu meant and she was talking about Consort Jin.Thinking that Mammy Mu didn't know the real reason, he couldn't tell the truth and only regretted coming here today. He couldn't say it clearly, because Mammy Mu stayed in the imperial palace for a longer time and was more capable than him. He feared that she would know something through his words.Then Fucheng dared not to complain anymore, and even forgot to do what he wanted to do. He hurried to say goodbye to Mammy Mu, and left.Mammy Mu sat with cross-legged on Luohan bed, looked at his back with old eyes and frowned unconsciously.If Yaoniang yielded to Jin Wang this time, she would take the old path. Since she had a new life, she couldn't recommit the same error.Jin Wang's attitude was normal. That was the common problem for a man from the imperial palace. If she didn't agree, he would be angry. If she agreed, he would suspect her. Jin Wang was a prince, and there were a lot of women who wanted to put themselves under the patronage of a higher-up. Also, how did Yaoniang come to the small lateral yard? She was arranged by Consort Jin on the surface.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 30": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Jin Wang Dotes on His ConcubineCH 25Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayJin Wang got angry all day.It was not only because of Yaoniang, but also because of Fucheng's insensibility and contempt.As a prince, he needed to let servants send him a dizzy woman, didn't Fucheng look down upon him? He really added firewood to the fire that was previously lit by Yaoniang!He couldn't bully the little wet nurse, advoiding someone said he was unwise, brilliant, majestic and powerful. Naturally he chose to bully unwise Fecheng.Looking at Fucheng's sadness, while Jin Wang felt a touch of delight.But he still didn't feel happy, because the pale and beautiful face of the little wet nurse always flashed in his mind. After she went out, he heard the movement outside and there was an inexplicable feeling of anxiety sprang up.She was so timid that she must be frightened. Actually he didn't want to do anything, just wanted to see...He thought a lot. Jin Wang arranged servants to go to the small lateral yard the next morning.Not to mention Yaoniang was distracted for a whole day.She didn't know that feeling exactly,\u00a0 she was afraid that someone would\u00a0 let her leave after a while and was also afraid that Jin Wang would be more annoyed and want to punish her when he returned, or something else, but she didn't understand.She was awake all night, After Yaoniang woke up the next day, she saw the dark circles under her eyes in the mirror.Unfortunately, she had never used rouge gouache, nor had she prepared such a thing. She could not cover it, so she could only go to work with the dark circles.Yaoniang's white skin made her dark circles more obvious. Seeing that, Yuyan was a bit surprised. After she learned that Yaoniang didn't sleep well at night, she could not help repeatedly,sigh that she hadn't seen Yaoniang like that before when Yaoniang was on night duty. Why didn't she fall asleep when she didn't work at night?Yaoniang was embarrassed and could not answer. Fortunately, Yuyan didn't say anything else, just let Lv'e go to the kitchen to get a freshly boiled egg and rub Yaoniang's eyes.When people from Zhaohui Hall came, Yaoniang was holding the egg rubbing her eyes and her face was halfway up. Hearing that someone came to her from Zhaohui Hall, she was shocked. After she reacted, she was scalded to pain, and it's red under her eyes.Seeing that the egg fell to the ground, she wanted to pick it up in a hurry, and almost broke the mirror.She just stood up and saw Lu'e come in cheerfully, \"Wet Nurse Su, the Highness rewards you something.\"What!Yaoniang stunned.\"Go out and thank Jin Wang quickly. The Highness said that you are good at serving the little princess... \" Lv'e said as she pulled Yaoniang out. Yuyan, Yucui and others all looked at her with a smile.When she went out, a young eunuch wearing a crew neck shirt stood there, and there were a few eunuchs holding trays around him.In the whole Jin Wang Mansion, there were only eunuchs around Jin Wang, and they were all brought out of the imperial palace that year.Yaoniang also knew this eunuch. He was Fucheng's adopted son, Xiao Shunzi, who was also a first-rate celebrity in Jin Wang Mansion.Yaoniang knelt down and thanked for rewarding, and then they left soon.After they left, everyone in the small lateral yard gathered to congratulate Yaoniang and said many good words to her.Jin Wang was the most generous person in the whole Jin Wang Mansion. As long as the things Jin Wang could reward, it would be so surprised for them. In particular, this was the first time that Jin Wang had rewarded a servant, so it must make other people jealous. Even the people in Liuchun Pavilion heard the news and came here.The trays were covered with red cloths. Some wanted to open it to see, but they were driven away by termagant Lvyao. And some relied on being familiar with Yaoniang, and asked her for a dinner party, therefore, it was noisy in the courtyard.Seeing this scene, Yurong said, \"Okay, all right, everyone leaves first and let Wet Nurse Su invite you to eat pastries and drink wine some other day.\"Yaoniang understood the rules in the Mansion after coming here for some time. Generally, if the servants got the rewards, they would have to buy some food to share with everyone. Naturally, she nodded and agreed with Yurong, then said that she would invite everyone to eat pastries and drink wine some other day, they all went to do their things.Cuizhu kept standing in the crowd all the time. Her cheeks were thin and her face was haggard. Looking at the Yaoniang surrounded by others, she was hated and jealous. She squeezed her bruised hands, gritted her teeth and left.Lv'e and others helped Yaoniang to bring things back to the room, then they left, leaving Yaoniang alone.She stood at the table and hesitated before lifting up the red silk on the trays.Jin Wang was really generous. He rewarded a red gold tangled bracelet, a pair of red gold pendant earrings, and a red gold hairpin.They were dangling, shining and very heavy.Jin Wang was really rich compared with the gilt tassel hairpin and jade bracelets that were rewarded by Side Consort Hu before..Seriously speaking, Yaoniang had already received many rewards, so she was familiar with it. But this time made her see the light..She was right..Jin Wang was indeed a gentleman.So after she said that, he couldn't force her, and even did not transfer his anger on others. Because apples are apples and oranges are oranges, you cannot mix them up. Yaoniang knew that Jin Wang was a very matter-of-fact being, so she courageously said those words yesterday.But because Yaoniang understood this, she felt a little bit upset.In addition to these pieces of jewelries, there were clothes placed in the other two trays. But Yaoniang did not see them carefully and just put them into the box. She did not have the opportunity to wear them.*In in the inner study of Zhaohui Hall, Jin Wang sat after the book case, and there were several people sitting on the circle chairs on the left and right sides.Jin Wang handled some private affairs in this inner study. Those people who was able to enter here was enough to prove that they were all Jin Wang's henchmen.They were all aides or retainers of Jin Wang Mansion with different names, but without exception, they were all under Jin Wang's management.Yes, it was not Jin Wang's Mansion, but was Jin Wang.Although the Jin Wang Mansion was the residence of Jin Wang, but there were various people, so it could not be regarded as strong as iron. Changshi Department was set up by the imperial court to monitor the local princes. In particular, Jin Zhou was different from other places and was close to the sideline fortress. Jin Wang held hundreds of thousands of military forces, so there were many scouts of the imperial court and other parts in Jin Wang Mansion.Because Jin Wang treated other princes in the same way, the division was very clear.The first person on the left was wearing a robe and holding a fan. His age was unknown. His hair was white but he looked very young, and didn't have a beard. This person's surname was Liu, and was called Mr. Liu. Few people knew his origins, but he was very appreciated by Jin Wang, as if he was the most important aide.A black-faced big man sat next to him. He was Commander Chou Zhan of the Mansion army, and managed 9,000 soldiers. He was a general under Jin Wang and had won Jin Wang's trust.One wore a monk robe, and one wore a Confucian shirt. The person wearing a Confucian shirt looked fierce as if someone dared to provoke him and then he would kill the whole family, but the person wearing a monk robe was fat\u00a0 with big head and big belly. He did not tonsure, and did not look like a monk obviously. All in all, only Qiuzhan seemed normal among four people.Jin Wang was discussing with them.Mr. Liu used the feather fan in his hand and said, \"In this way, does Yong Wang get rid of the suspicion?\"The person who dressed well but with a fierce look was called as Mr. Dark, and he interjected immediately before Mr. Liu finished speaking, \"Even if it's not him, he must have something to do with this thing.Mr. Dark spoke Shu dialect. Even if he came to the Jin Wang Mansion for many years, he couldn't speak official language and called others stupid.Because of his accent, when he first came to the Jin Wang Mansion, he made a lot of jokes. But it was almost one month that no one dared to laugh at him, they all rushed to avoid him when they saw him. Because Mr. Dark deserved his name, he was used to have some bad tricks, and never blinked when he hurt and killed people.If Mr. Liu was a good man, and he was used to using some righteous ways. While Mr. Dark had crooked and devilish tricks.As for Li Maotian in a monk robe, he could be regarded as neutralizing the personalities of Mr. Liu and Mr. Dark. He was considered to be moderate and without any surprises, but he was careful and had no omissions.He sat on a circle chair that seemed to be crushed, rubbed his garlic nose, and said, \"The Crown Prince is the most suspicious, but... \"The incident happened nearly a year ago, and a lot of people under Jin Wang were sent secretly. They searched the whole Yong Zhou inch by inch and send many scouts to Yong Wang Mansion. But the information received showed that the matter was not done by Yong Wang, at last, Crown Prince in the Capital City was most suspicious.Crown Prince?He was more than 40 years old, but was still a Crown Prince, and he was overwhelmed by Emperor Hong Jing. Although he was Crown Prince, but in fact he was just a loser that the grandson of the emperor was more favored.It's really incredible, but the news showed that it was indeed Crown Prince, and it should be said that it was the part of the East Palace. Actually the grandson of the emperor was most likely to steal the spotlight from Crown Prince.Why did he do this? Did he want Jin Wang and Yong Wang to fight against each other? It seemed it was not a big thing but it was also not a small thing. For a man, it really trampled on dignity, but it was not really worth fighting. He always felt that the part of the East Palace did a lot of work, but they just did a trivial matter, and this was something unreasonable.Li Maotian questioned it.Jin Wang's face was so indifferent that others didn't guess his emotions. Just his left hand touched the jade ring on the thumb of the right hand inadvertently, and he turned it occasionally.Mr. Dark smiled, and his eyes moved. He reached out and patted Li Maotian's plump spine, then said with a loud voice, \"You stupid, what do you care about? Don't think too much, and they must have some reasons... \"Li Maotian couldn't think about it for a moment, all in his ears was a series of Shu dialects that made him listen to laboriously.\"Everything has its meaning, but they really doesn't need to spend so much time... \"\"Look at yourself! You are asking for trouble, you look so stupid.\"Even if Li Maotian was stupid, he realized that Mr. Dark was perverted. This black man was not so rambling as usual, unless...He hesitated, and finally realized that there was something unusual.From the beginning, Jin Wang did not have any suspect to the East Palace why they spent so much time doing such an absurd matter. Since there was no objection from Jin Wang, it showed that East Palace must have a reason to do so, but what was the reason?Could it be that--Li Maotian didn't think about it anymore. He followed Jin Wang for many years and knew that his master's strategy was extraordinary. These so-called aides did not provide suggestions, but they were about making up for mistakes. After all, no one was perfect, and there were always unexpected points. As for the general direction, Jin Wang had never made a mistake.Since Li Maotian knew that he couldn't say any more, he immediately scolded Mr. Dark because he just called him \"stupid\". He disputed with Mr. Dark, and it seemed they wouldn't stop argue..The two funny fellows were born with anomalies, and once they were not serious, it made people feel funny.Anyway, Mr. Liu shook his head and smiled. He used the feather fan and said, \"Okay, if you continue to argue, please go out. Don't obstruct Highness here.\"They moved quickly. After giving respect to Jin Wang, they pulled each other's sleeves and went out. Until they went outside, quarrel between the two could still be heard.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 31": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Jin Wang Dotes on His ConcubineCH 26Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter they went out, Mr. Liu analyzed this matter with Jin Wang again. He talked much about Crown Prince's disfavor and the suspicion of the Grandson of the Emperor to replace Crown Prince.In the past two years, the attitude of Emperor Hong Jing was indeed quite ambiguous. Crown Prince was incompetent, and it didn't seem to be impossible for the Grandson of the Emperor to replace Ccrown Prince. The problem was that in addition to Crown Prince, there were several young princes who had the strong cultural and military strategy.Such as An Wang, Yong Wang and Jin Wang.Would these princes be willing to watch a young boy to ascend the throne one day? Crown Prince was the first son of the Empress and was also the eldest among the princes, so he was well-deserved to get the throne.But the Grandson of the Emperor? After all, he was just a grandson, not Crown Prince. Even if he was talent but was not enough to convince the public.Maybe the Grandson of Emperor also knew that his uncles were not willing to watch him to ascend the throne, so he took actions firstly. He first dealt with Jin Wang and Yong Wang who were the most powerful among the princes. But with a few tricks, the two princes had a fight, and he sat on the mountain to watch the two tigers fight. His deep thoughts made people dumbfounded.Then an old question came again. Why did the Grandson of the Emperor do the shameful thing? Was he sure\u00a0 that he could provoke Jin Wang and Yong Wang to be hostile?What was he relying on?This was an unavoidable question, and Mr. Liu knew the reason, but he ignored this question and only discussed something else.But before leaving, Mr. Liu said one word to Jin Wang that he should have a son. Not only Jin Wang needed to have descendants, but he should do everything well. Yong Wang and An Wang had more than one son, but Jin Wang had no one. This was his biggest weakness.After Mr. Liu left, there was a silence in the inner study, and only then Jin Wang showed his indifferent face.Suddenly, he tapped the table, and a person appeared in front of him in a blink of an eye.It was a man in tight clothes with an ordinary face.\"Let my people in the Capital City do something. I remember that Crown Prince is obsessed with beauty and has not stepped into the Crown Princess' room for a long time. The Crown Princess is at a sexually active age, so she must be lonely when she stays alone. Send her a man to enjoy. The Grandson of the Emperor seems to be ready for a wedding, is he going to marry the daughter of the Chen's family? Don't make him so easy to hold a wedding and stirs him up. Regarding the antidote, just let others find it from the Grandson of the Emperor.\"\"Yes.\"The man disappeared, and the inner study became quiet again until Fucheng came in.\"My Highness, the rewards had been sent to the small lateral yard.\"Actually, he didn't need to report it to Jin Wang. It was just a reward for a servant and the master was not necessary to pay attention. But it was not the same among the servants, especially the previous thing between Jin Wang and Yaoniang, Fucheng naturally took it seriously.Jin Wang's face was as cold as water. After hearing this, his eyes moved.He suddenly wanted to see the little wet nurse, and wanted to see if she could understand his words and would be not afraid of him. Especially now he was not in a good mood and wanted to go out to get a breath of fresh air.At the same time, Jin Wang also realized that it would be too obvious to go to find Yaoniang now, so he looked down at the secret letters on the table until nearly noon, he went to the small lateral yard with Fucheng.At this time, it was lunch time in the small lateral yard. The maids and madams had lunch in batches. The lunch for Yuyan and Yaoniang was prepared. The little princess was playing, so Yaoniang asked Yucui to eat first. Anyway, she was not hungry now.The little princess was playing on the bed. At this time, the baby girl was very active. The weather was hot, and there was no ice in the room, so Yaoniang only wore a small bellyband on the little princess and let her play on the bed. She just stayed on her side and watched her not to fall from bed.Looking at the little princess with a smile, Yaoniang's heart softened and she thought of Xiao Bao. Xiao Bao was about the same age as the little princess, so maybe he could turn over now.Yaoniang missed Xiao Bao so much and became sad. She wished she could have a pair of wings to fly back to Liuyun County immediately to see Xiao Bao and her sister.Yaoniang immersed herself in her thoughts and naturally ignored the movement behind her. Until Jin Wang came to her, she realized that someone came in the room.She looked out of the window subconsciously and found no one in the courtyard. She thought that it was time to eat at this moment, and the gatekeeper was shiftless again. In fact, nobody came to the small lateral yard in usual, and it was Jing Wang Mansion, so the servants here were lazy. In addition, Yuyan and Yucui treated people well, so it was inevitable that someone acted in a slick way.She bent her knees to salute, and did not dare to look up.She thought about the reward in the morning, and was not sure what Jin Jin would do at this time.\"I come here to see the little princess.\" Jin Wang coughed softly and said.Yaoniang nodded quickly.According to the rules, she should serve tea when the master came. But at this moment there was no one in the small lateral yard, and Fucheng didn't even show up. Yaoniang was very skeptical that Jin Wang could look after the little princess, so she could only stand there nervously and ignored it.It was very quiet and they seemed to be looking at the little princess who kept turning over on the bed, but their attentions were scattered.Yaoniang thought a lot and whispered, \"Thanks for your reward, my Highness.\"Jin Wang gave a faint sound and paused before he said, \"You have served the little princess well, and I should have rewarded you earlier.\"Did it mean that he let her pass like this?Did he mean that they could forget what happened on that day?Yaoniang could understand. At this time, when she heard the words of Jin Wang, she felt relieved.She felt a little joy for her success. Maybe she could really stay safely until the little princess got older, and then brought home the money she earned.While thinking about this, Yaoniang couldn't help but glance at Jin Wang.Jin Wang was tall and his back was straight. He clasped his hands behind him, and looked at the little princess coldly. His handsome face was still the same as before, and was almost no extra expression, however, his soft eyes softened the sharpness of the entire face.Yaoniang had never seen Jin Wang like this.She even faintly envied the naive baby girl on the bed.She thought that only the little princess could let Jin Wang take off his coldness, and take good care of her in this world.Jin Wang thought that this little wet nurse was a bit silly. He had been here for a long time, but she didn't mention the dishes and even a cup of tea.He wondered who taught her rules.After that, Yaoniang found Jin Wang frowning.He was handsome when he frowned.Yaoniang had seen many people frown before, but some looked very vicious, or some were with two swellings on their foreheads, and some even changed the shape of their eyes and wrinkled together.He was the only one with long, smooth eyebrows, neither thick nor pale, like an ink and wash painting shrouded in smoke and rain. His brow\u00a0 was not too sharp but very soft. When he frowned, he hadn't wrinkles but a radian between the eyebrows. It was more appropriate to describe it as knitting his bows.Yaoniang suddenly remembered a poem. How beautiful she looks, opening the pearly casement, and how quiet she leans, and how troubled her brow is. You may see the tears now, bright on her cheek, but not the man she so bitterly loves.After thinking about it, she felt that she was too bold. How could she compare Jin Wang to a woman? But looking at him carefully, Jin Wang was really more beautiful than a woman.Yaoniang felt that she learned a fact why Jin Wang always kept his face stern. Because he was so good-looking, if such an appearance was seen by others, how could he deter people in the Mansion and lead the border soldiers to fight against barbarity.As soon as Yaoniang was wandering, Jin Wang had watched her for a long time, and of course he found that the little wet nurse was peeking at him.Jin Wang was not strange for this kind of eyes. Seriously speaking, he had been seen by many people like this. But there was never a person to look at him with such a look.There were not any thoughts, ulterior motives, and complicated things in her eyes, but it was very pure. She seemed to look at him, not Jin Wang.Such a look made Jin Wang momentarily dazed, but he was interrupted before thinking deeply,Fucheng didn't come in with Jin Wang just now. Because he was judicious, and also had to call the maids.Yuyan and Yucui came in and knelt on the ground.The two of them came out from the palace and knew that the rules in the palace were the most rigorous. They were in Zhaohui Hall before, and the rules were roughly the same as in the palace. But after they came to the small lateral yard, they became idle. Even there was no one on duty at the door outside, so they didn't know Jiang Wang here at the first time.According to Jin Wang's rules, both Yuyan and Yucui would be whip more than ten times. But this time he just said lightly that they wouldn't let that happen again, and then let them stand up.Yuyan and Yucui were still scared. Looking at their pale face, Yaoniang didn't understand why they looked so scared.In fact, Yaoniang was also afraid of Jin Wang, but she knew that Jin Wang was not a person who would lose his temper and transfer his anger on others at random.Jin Wang did not have lunch and Yuyan went to arrange.People prepared quickly in the kitchen. It was just a few minutes, here came the lunch.They placed the dishes on the table in Dongci room, and then Jin Wang moved forward.Yaoniang was very hungry now. The wet nurse was easy to get hungry and her stomach cried out for food now.She thought that Yuyan and Yucui were all here now, and they could help to look after the little princess, so she could go to lunch. She quietly told Yucui and then was going to leave.She thought that her behavior was not noticeable, but everything was in the sight of someone.\"Since Wet Nurse Su is free now, then you serve meals for Jin Wang.\" Fucheng said.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 32": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Jin Wang Dotes on His ConcubineCH 27Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayFucheng put his hands in his sleeves, and stood behind Jin Wang with a triummphant look.He was wearing a turquoise filigree collar shirt, a black hat, a pair of black leather boots, and a green bat-like jade on his waist. He looked to be in his early thirties, but Yaoniang knew that Fucheng was already over forties. However, the eunuchs all had fine and tender skin, so they looked younger.He glanced at the corner, then saw that Yaoniang was about to leave.In fact, Jin Wang also looked there, but it was not so obvious.\"Since Wet Nurse Su is free, then you stay and serve meals for Jin Wang.\"Yaoniang looked up at Fucheng in surprise.Then she looked at Jin Wang who was sitting at the table. He looked indifferent and did not show any objection. It seemed that he was agreed. But there were so many maids here, why was her turn to serve meals?\"Wet Nurse Su is the first to get this chance among the servants.\" Fucheng smiled and said.It's true that servants who were valued by the master had a good tongue. Even though Fucheng didn't mention what happened in the morning, but he meant that Yaoniang should spare no effort in the performance of her duty after she\u00a0 received the reward from Jin Wang\u00a0 She should do her best to serve Jin Wang, and the first thing was to serve this meal well.Yuyan and others did not dare to speak, and Yaoniang felt a little helpless here. But in this case, she certainly couldn't refuse, and could only come to the table.Lv'e took the water basin and let Yaoniang wash her hands, looking at her worriedly.This might look simple, but in fact, it couldn't be done well by anyone. They needed to know the master's preferences and meaningful glance. The master wanted to eat this dish, but you took that one. Obviously, the master would be unhappy. And the master wouldn't say anything to guide you how to do it. If the master needed to instruct everything to you, then you would be not a must.Besides, Jin Wang was famous for his excessive demands.It was because his stern face. Once he was not happy, he would draw a long face and scare people. Of course, she heard all of those things from Lv'e and others. They could not serve meals for Jin Wang with their identities.The girls whose names included\u00a0 the character \"Lv\" looked at Yaoniang anxiously, and thought that the reward of Highness could not be taken casually. While his reward also contained an infinite crisis, and it was easily to be disliked because of a small mistake.Yuyan and Yucui were still calm, and there were no expressions on their faces.Yaoniang cleaned her hands with a dry handkerchief. She first rolled up her sleeves, and then took the long silver chopsticks held by Lvyao.In fact, Yaoniang was familiar with serving meals for Jin Wang, and she did many times in her previous life, so she knew how picky he was. The key was that he was still a bad-tempered person. Once he was not happy, he would draw a long face. Yaoniang was disliked by Jin Wang many times because of this in her previous life..Although he didn't say anything, it was showed in his eyes, \"You didn't know how to serve a meal, then what else could you do?\"At that time, for the sake of avenging an insult and also pleasing Jin Wang, Yaoniang learned it by heart. Although she didn't know much about other aspects of Jin Wang, she knew clearly about his little habits in life.The dishes on the table were very rich and all delicious and good-looking, with eight dishes and one soup.Yaoniang only smelled it and the knew that these dishes were from the small kitchen in Zhaohui Hall.She was not used to be greedy. But after eating Jin Wang's leftovers several times, she knew what was delicious on earth and it was too delicious for people to swallow their tongues. In the previous life, Yaoniang was only a concubine. Even if she was doted, she still ate dishes from the large kitchen. Although the food in the large kitchen was not bad, she always felt that it seemed to lack something.As for what it was, Yaoniang couldn't tell. Anyway, she knew that Jin Wang's meal was delicious.There were five meat dishes, three vegetables dishes and one soup. The meat dishes included saut\u00e9ed shredded pig trip, saut\u00e9ed mushroom with sliced chicken, fish ball in light soup, spicy rabbit, casserole simmer deer tendon. The vegetables dishes included braised bamboo shoots in wine sauce, cabbage with Fresh mushroom, sir-fried wild rice stem. The soup was the pork-seafood soup.Maybe Yaoniang was really hungry, and she couldn't stop drooling, and her heart was burning.However, she did not forget the errand she would do. When she saw Jin Wang holding the silver chopsticks, she pressed the sleeve with one hand and took a few pieces of Sir-fried wild rice stem with the other hand and put it in the porcelain plate of Jin Wang.Probably she was too familiar with this scene, or she might be really hungry. For a while, Yaoniang forgot that she was born in an ordinary family, and had never done anything to serve meals after entering the Mansion, so she shouldn't know how to serve meals.While her action was methodical, smooth and beautiful. She slightly lifted her slender fingers, and every move contained calmness, it was as beautiful as a painting. Even people could easily ignore her dress at this time, but subconsciously thought that this woman was beautiful.The most important thing was that she did it without any hesitation, and she seemed to know what dishes Jin Wang would like.Jin Wang also really liked to eat.Unlike other people in the army, Jin Wang liked vegetables but meat. He also ate meat, but he preferred vegetables. Of course, some would definitely say why he liked vegetables but there were many meat dishes. This question was a bit esoteric. Anyway, Yaoniang had also served Jin Wang for a long time, and then knew that there were many strange rules around him.Such as these dishes, Jin Wang didn't eat much. Maybe he only ate a few for each dish. His preference was very changeable, but there was only one truth, that was, following his eyes.One took the dishes, and the other ate. They cooperated well.Seeing this, Fucheng and other people were very surprised.It was very quiet, as if there was no one here.Anyway, Yaoniang served meals for Jin Wang more than once or twice. She admired him very much that he never made any noise when he was eating, even the sound of chewing.The dishes Yaoniang took for Jin Wang were finished in a blink of an eye before everyone reacted.Suddenly, a voice of stomach growling sounded loud because it was very quiet..Yaoniang's face turned red, and she could not wait to find a place to hide. She thought Jin Wang might scold her for being discourteous, but he didn't say anything at all and seemed not to hear it.Jin Wang took a few bites and dropped silver chopsticks.\"I reward the rest of the dishes to you.\"Jin Wang did not mention the name, but everyone's eyes came over immediately, and Yaoniang did not think about others except herself.She looked at the dishes that most of them were not be eaten, and thought in confusion, was Jin Wang's appetite not good today?*Jin Wang did not stay long, and he left after lunch.He seemed to be here for lunch.Due to Yaoniang got this reward from Jin Wang, she was able to return to the room to eat, and someone respectfully helped her to bring these leftovers back to her room and to place them on the table.Sometimes Yaoniang didn't understand this kind of rules, they\u00a0 just were Jin Wang's leftovers. How could it be so different? They were just dishes.Yaoniang didn't understand this truth in her previous life and she might not figure it out in this life. Anyway, she ate Jin Wang's leftovers many times and adapted well. Because these dishes were so delicious, she wanted to swallow her tongue and ate more a bowl of rice than ever until her belly became round.She didn't finish all dishes, and there were still a lot.Why not eat them at night?Yaoniang thought silently, and a little girl named A'xia agreed with her.A'xia was fourteen years old, and was very beautiful and smart. She just entered the Mansion and now worked as a maid in the small kitchen.She liked to talk to Yaoniang very much. Although Yaoniang was not much older than her, she had a sense of vicissitudes because of different experiences. While it was no doubt that the innocence of Axia was a dazzling scenery in the Mansion, people couldn't help smiling when seeing her, so Yaoniang also liked to talk to her.A'xia volunteered to help Yaoniang clean up the dishes this time. As she cleaned the table, she yelled, \"I'll use ice to keep these dishes fresh, and it won't go bad at night. We can add some vegetables and cook again, then it will be a delicious dinner.\"Yaoniang nodded, \"Then bother you.\"\"It's fine. This is what I should do.\"A'xia was very talented in cooking. She was favoured by Madam Mo who would teach her something from time to time. Now, she was able to do some simple food. Judging by this, it wouldn't take a long time for Madam Mo to accept her as an apprentice.\"Wet Nurse Su, you don't know. Everyone envies you so much, they say that you have great skills and the Highness reward you many times.\"Yaoniang laughed blushingly, \"How can they say so exaggeratedly? But it is just a coincidence that I had a chance to serve meals for the Highness, and then the Highness rewarded me.\"\"Anyway, Wet Nurse Su is a lucky girl. Tell me about it, are you afraid of the Highness? Why am I afraid of the\u00a0 Highness from a distance and dare not look him straight.\"Yaoniang hesitated and said, \"In fact, the Highness is a very good person. He keeps strictly the rules for reward andpunishment, and also takes care of his people.\" She didn't know how to describe him, so she could say something intelligible.\"I really envy Wet Nurse Su. You don't know how much they talk about you today. But there are two women in the kitchen that are really annoying. They always say sour words, and also want to join other people to let Wet Nurse Su spend lots of money to buy food and drinks. \"A'xia wrinkled her nose, with disgust on her face.Yaoniang was not surprised. Actually these people weren't bad people, and they just became jealous when they saw her getting rewards. Then they were trying to get a psychological balance in this way. Yaoniang didn't feel anything wrong, because she had planned to invite everyone to have a drink this time.She just couldn't help sighing in her heart, when she remenbered the things Jin Wang rewarded.After A'xia left, Yaoniang went to the cabinet and turned out a small cloth bag.There were a month's wages, jewelries and silvers rewarded by the Side Consort Hu last time and also things rewarded by Jin Wang today in this small cloth bag.If these things were replaced with equivalent silver, there were a few hundred liang. But the problem was that each of those rewards was marked, so she couldn't sell them out.Yaoniang suddenly became annoyed.This kind of grudge was not only for this life, but also the grievances in the previous life.It was the same in her previous life. Jin Wang rewarded her all the gaudy things. They all were beautiful and valuable, some were worthless, but unfortunately these things must be registered and couldn't be lost.But the money she mostly wanted was her poor wages every month. She did not dare to ask Jin Wang for money for her son, so she could only save from her wages. But she spent more than half of her monthly money on rewarding people. Actually, she didn't send much money back.It needed to spend more than ten taels of silvers for inviting people to drink wines and eat food. After all, she got rewards from Jin Wang and also got so many good things. If she wouldn't be generous, they would said her bad words and thought she was stingy. But as long as she thought that she only had thirty taels of silvers in total and would spend ten tales of silvers, there was always a feeling of a knife being twisted in her heart.When could she save enough money to go home?Yaoniang sat there sighing for a while, then took out ten tales of silvers from it, and was planning to put the cloth bag back. After thinking about it, she took five tales of silvers again.It was better to take more money. If she didn't take enough money, she would be shameful.*In Zhaohui Hall, Anshi coldly stood with his hands in front of the book case and said, \"Wet Nurse Su ate a lot, and she ate two bowls of rice until her belly was round. She didn't throw the rest dishes and planned to eat at night.\"As the dark guard beside Jin Wang, Anshi would inevitably help him to detect something in the secret. Generally, in this case, he would choose to report in details, without any personal emotions, because only in this way could the master be accurate to analyze it.So Yaoniang ate two bowls of rice, and she didn't throw the rest of dishes, and planned to eat at night. Those things were reported to Jin Wang.Jin Wang showed a smile and was about to say something, while Fucheng came in.Seeing this, Jin Wang waved his hand, and Anshi disappeared before Fucheng came in.\"My Highness, there is someone passing the message from Siyi Courtyard.\"Jin Wang took a glance at him.Fucheng hesitated for a while and said\uff0c\"It's the people around the Consort Jin. He said that the birthday of Consort Jin is on the fifteenth day. The Consort Jin intends to host a banquet in Siyi Courtyard, and hopes that the Highness will be able to show up.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 33": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Jin Wang Dotes on His ConcubineCH 28.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayJin Wang frowned after hearing that it was on the fifteenth day.Besides Jin Wang, Fucheng was also worried, \"How about I decline the invitation?\"Jin Wang pondered for a moment and then shook his head.Consort Jin didn't like to stay in lively places. This was the first time that Consort Jin wanted to hold a banquet to celebrate her birthday after she married Jin Wang for many years. Certainly, he should take part in the banquet.Since Jin Wang made a decision, Fucheng couldn't say anything more.The moon was bright and stars were few. The disk-like bright moon made all the stars dim.It was brightly lit in Siyi Courtyard, and the servants went in and out from time to time.Consort Jin didn't like a lively life and always refused to hold a banquet. It was rare that Consort Jin proposed to hold a banquet today, so it was full of joy in Siyi Courtyard.Now that an announcement made by Consort Jin, the Side Consort Hu and others would naturally come to celebrate her birthday. They came during the daytime, and Consort Jin didn't show up to accompany them but she only rewarded with delicious dishes to them. Then they left after finishing their meals.Lady Tao and others got used to the personality of Consort Jin. But the Side Consort Hu gnashed her teeth and went to Zhaohui Hall angrily. She wanted to stop Jin Wang going to Siyi Courtyard and made Consort Jin angry, but unfortunately, Jin Wang was not in Zhaohui Hall. She couldn't go to the front yard, but only went back with anger. After returning to her room, she found an excuse, and vented her anger on Cuizhu.Jin Wang left the front yard and then went directly to Siyi Courtyard.From the moment Jin Wang stepped into the backyard, someone kept reporting to Siyi Courtyard all the way. When Jin Wang stepped into the flower hall, he saw that many kinds of delicious food were placed on a square table, and Consort Jin had been waiting for a long time.Consort Jin wore a bright red cluster tulle short summer gown, and a long Wanfu satin skirt. She combed a cloud bun with a red gold hair pin.She used to be dressed in causal and rarely wore such dazzling clothes, which made her more charming.When Jin Wang saw consort Jin, he\u00a0 was a little surprised and frowned unconsciously, but it was not obvious.Madam Zhou was proud. She was right that men were erotic and no one liked his women to dress up plain. Red represented happy events and her Consort Jin was pretty, so now the Highness was attracted by Consort Jin.Compared with Madam Zhou, Consort Jin who was sitting at the table\u00a0 clenched her hands under sleeves and there was a hint of forbearance on her face. When Madam Zhou pushed her gently from behind,\u00a0 Consort Jin stood up and greeted Jin Wang, and then they came to the table and sat down together.In addition to a table of delicious dishes, two jugs of wine were placed on the table.One was the pine wine drunk by Jin Wang, which was put in a white jade jug, and the other was litchi wine.Litchi wine belonged to fruit wine. The noble ladies in capital city liked to drink this kind of wine. Its price was very high and it would spend ten liang silvers for a pot of litchi wine. In spite of this, the demand exceeded supply. The litchi wine was put in a crystal clear glass jug at this time and the amber-colored wine reflected the mottled colorful light under the light of palace lamps, which was so beautiful.There was an insignificant light flashing in Jin Wang's eyes. Because he knew that Consort Jin never drank alcohol.Consort Jin was very happy today, so she not only poured wine for Jin Wang, but also poured a glass of wine for herself, and proposed a toast to Jin Wang initiatively.Jin Wang was very clever. When he thought of the letter from Xu Guogong Mansion a few days ago, he had some ideas about the purpose of Consort Jin. Seeing that Madam Zhou kept winking at Consort Jin and Consort Jin showed an unwilling smile, Jin Wang's eyes became colder, and he sneered in his heart.He drank but didn\u2019t say anything. Probably because they were accustomed to the indifference of Jin Wang, Consort Jin and Madam Zhou did not seem to see the coldness in his eyes.It was also because they were thinking about something so that they neglected all of this.Madam Zhou stood there helplessly .If permissible, she really wanted to push Consort Jin away and behaved for her.She thought that it was not shameful to please her own man. The husband and wife were integration, and it didn't matter who lowered head first.It was a pity that Consort Jin never figured it out. Maybe she understood, but she didn't want to do it.But now it was not time for her to hesitate. Xu Guogong Mansion sent letters and kept asking Consort Jin about kids.In fact, this was not the first time that l Xu Guogong Mansion sent a letter to ask her about kids. They sent several letters every year and Consort Jin always rejected and ignored. But this time Xu Guogong said in the letter, if Consort Jin couldn't give birth to a kid of Jin Wang, he would arrange another daughter from Xu's family to give birth to kids instead of her.Not to mention how entangled it was, Xu Guogong depreciated himself to do such things. The key was that the candidate in his mind was Miss Thirteen of Xu's family.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Because as she came to Jinzhou, it became another distant thing for her.She became calm, and no longer entangled in the past. Actually, something was not as difficult as imagined, and after a long while, it was enough for her to forget the bad things.But Jin Wang's words were just like a barbed sword, and cruelly tore the wound that had been hidden in her heart for a long time. It made her flesh and blood flying in all directions. She felt so painful that various emotions entangled in her heart, and seemed to grow into a towering tree to drive her mad.\"You get out!\"Her entire face was distorted with red eyes and pale face, but her voice was suppressed. She stared at Jin Wang despairingly and ferociously.Jin Wang's eyes were full of sarcasm and mercy when he saw Consort Jin like this.Xu Yanru was not like this in his memory. She was as proud as a phoenix, and disdained everyone, even if a noble prince.There was no denying that Jiang Wang as a prince felt a little happy when he learned that Xu Huiru would be his consort at that time.Not only because of the forces behind her, but also because it was her.Xu Huiru was the most famous talented girl in Capital City and was just like a flower on the high mountain. Many wonder boys wanted to marry her and even some of his unmarried brothers fancied her. But this beautiful woman belonged to him. At that time, Jin Wang was young and still had some spirits of competition.So it was special for him that he got her but others failed.But after he married her, Jin Wang realized that some things were not as he thought.On their wedding night, she was reluctant to let him touch, and her eyes were full of disgust and rejection.He thought she was scared and didn't want to force her. He also had some psychological obstacles, so he wanted to give some time to each other.But one thing that happened later completely let Jin Wang change his views to Consort Jin.It was not just a new opinion to her, he even hated her.He would never forget the scene that two female bodies intertwined like maggots...An upset of nausea rushed into his throat, and Jin Wang took out a white piece of handkerchief from his sleeve and half covered his thin lips. Consort Jin seemed completely to misunderstand him and thought that Jin Wang intended to stimulate her.Because Jin Wang just said she was disgusted.Disgusted, disgusted...She humiliated herself!She shouldn't have such a thought!\"You get out, get out!\" At this time, Consort Jin couldn't control herself anymore, and cried hysterically.The movements seemed to be heard by people outside. Ziyan and Madam Zhou knocked at the door in a hurry and whispered Consort Jin, but nobody answered them.Looking at the woman in a mess, Jin Wang felt a little dispirited, and lost the desire to continue his revenge.He became indifferent, and his voice become colder, \"Xu Yanru, I tell you for the last time, you just do Consort Jin carefully and don't try to challenge me. Those things you've done are enough to ouster you a few times!\"Jin Wang left after saying that. Consort Jin slid weakly to the ground and shed tears silently.There was a chaos outside, and Madam Zhou hurried in.\"Niangniang, what's wrong? What the matter with you?\"Ziyan also followed her in, after hearing this, she interrupted her, \" Madam, let's hold up Niangniang first, we can talk about that later.\"Madam Zhou nodded again and again, and helped Consort Jin to the couch with Ziyan.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Fucheng sighed, and slowed down his steps.Jin Wang's complexion was also changeable between the light and shadow. He felt the fire of desire coming out of his body, and the blue veins on his forehead jumped up and down.Finally, Fucheng realized that Jin Wang was something wrong and called anxiously, \"My Highness?\"Jin Wang didn't answer him and walked slowly, there was a fine layer of sweat bead floated on his forehead.They arrived at Zhaohui Hall soon.Several eunuchs were greeted from inside when they saw Jin Wang.Fucheng said urgently, \"Prepare water first.\"After speaking, he hurriedly followed Jin Wang into the back bedroom....The pool was made of white marble and was about two feet square. There were four bronze animal heads that made of copper in four corners. At that moment, the water was spitting out from the animal's mouth.The water was cold.While the people in the pool seemed to be the burning fire.His body was like being made of white marble. He was tall and straight with firm body lines and clear texture. The man had long ink-like hair, but it was cluttered behind him at this time. His narrow eyes were closed and his handsome face was red for his suppression of desire.Fucheng squatted next to the pool, \"My Highness, how are you? How about I ask Doctor Liu?\"Jin Wang lowered his eyes and didn't answer him.He felt very painful as if his body was about to explode and Jin Wang was no stranger to this feeling. Seriously speaking, this feelings came up from time to time, and he could bear it in usual, but it was very difficult for him to bear it in the full moon night.In particular, that bitch even let him have an aphrodisiac.There should be no problem in the wine, then was it because the incense?Jin Wang was always cautious, but he never expected that Xu Yanru would use such an obscene method in order to achieve her purpose.Jin Wang discovered something wrong when he was in Siyi Courtyard.Since he was poisoned more than a year ago, he had become accustomed to the feeling when the poison started to work, but it was completely different this time. Thinking about the confident appearance of Madam Zhou before, what else did Jin Wang not understand?He leaned on the edge of the pool with his half-closed eyes, and lowered the temperature of his body with the cold texture of the pool. It was so pity that it was useless, and some pictures began to appear in his mind involuntarily ...All was related to women.Regardless of whether he was disgusted or not, these things appeared compulsorily, and played back and forth in his mind vividly.Jin Wang gasped strongly, and felt that his internal organs were vomiting. He couldn't deny his desire but retching.He suddenly felt that he wasn't ruthless enough, and all people from East Palace should be killed.The Grandson of the Emperor, Xu Yanru, and Consort Yong ..\"My Highness, how about I take Wet Nurse Su here?\" Seeing the situation of Jin Wang was so serious, Fucheng was like a drowning man and would clutch at a straw.Hearing this, Jin Wang's ears moved a bit, and he started to imagine the pictures related to the little wet nurse in his mind, such as, her two timid and cherished red lips, and then ...Yaoniang slept early.Now she didn't have to work on the night, so she got up early and also slept early every day.It was a little bit hot in the room and she felt sweating in the daze, so she got up from the couch and scrubbed herself with water behind the screen. The cold water made her feel very comfortable, and she returned to the couch again.The bed was covered with bamboo mats, and that place she just slept had become very hot, so Yaoniang changed a place to sleep, and felt much more comfortable. She stuck her face to the bamboo mats, and her eyes seemed to stay closed from beginning to end.She awoke, but her consciousness was unclear.Yaoniang drifted off again, and inexplicably felt that someone was looking at herself.Who was looking at her? Yaoniang was thinking. She was in her room and no one would see her, so she thought she was dreaming.Someone stood in the shadow of the moon, and only a pair of reddish eyes was very obvious.Jin Wang looked at her on the couch with hot blood, the thin and form-fitting clothes revealed her good figure. Her waist was tightened, and her hip was raised.It was the first time for him to see a woman sleeping like this. There was no doubt that it was a very beautiful sence and he didn't feel sick...He walked forward involuntarily, and hugged her...Yaoniang woke up completely. She would be in trouble if she didn't wake up.Then she found that she was tightly embraced by a man. His body was very hot and he was too strong to be pushed away by her.Yaoniang turned pale with fear and wanted to call someone.But she was really pressed too tightly in such a posture, and couldn't even open her mouth. As if he realized that she was awake, and the man reached out a finger to touch her mouth. When she just wanted to open her mouth, her small pink tongue was pressed by the man's finger.Yaoniang was so frightened and her face became pale. She couldn't imagine that such a bold thief would break into the Mansion, and just broke into a wet nurse's room.What should she do? If she had known this, she would rather to serve Jin Wang.Thinking of Jin Wang, Yaoniang suddenly felt something wrong. Because the person who pressed her was just maintaining this posture, and didn't have no other action. Smelling the familiar smell on her nose, and felt the familiar tone, Yaoniang's heart trembled and she said subconsciously, \"My Highness?\u201dThe voice was squeezed out of the throat, and it was very low, like a mosquito's.But it easily heard by Jin Wang. After all, they were very close and Jin Wang's head and face were behind Yaoniang's head.The man gave a vague murmur, and Yaoniang was sure that it was Jin Wang by this.But how did he come to her room, and how did he get in? Why did he do this? After that time, did he not give up his evil desire and keep coveting her?After knowing that it was Jin Wang, although Yaoniang was in a mixed mood, she was finally not so afraid.She couldn't say how she felt. As long as Jin Wang was by her side, she seemed not to be afraid even if she was in a dangerous situation.\"My Highness, can you let me go? We can't do like this... \"\"No.\" A hoarse male voice interrupted her decisively.Uh\u2026Yaoniang was scared now. She was not afraid that Jin Wang was pressing herself, but that she would have to go the same way if Jin Wang couldn't\u00a0 control himself and forced himself upon her.She didn't want to be a concubine of Jin Wang, and still wanted to go home ...\"I feel very uncomfortable, and you don't move ... \"Uncomfortable? Yaoniang couldn't think of anything else, and finally realized her situation\u2014he was very hot, and one place on his body was hotter which was against her thigh...Even if it was very dark in the room, Yaoniang knew that her face must be very flushed.It felt like a sound of a bang, and something was blown into pieces on the ground.What did he want to do? What would he do? How could he suddenly be like this ...Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Besides, he seemed to be painful, and there was his low and unrefined gasp from his throat.Yaoniang had served Jin Wang many times in her previous life, and she might know his reactions better than himself. Normally he should not be like this, even if he was always anxious, he would not be like this...\"I am poisoned, and fell very uncomfortable... \"Jin Wang felt that the little wet nurse could relieve his pain, and he didn't want her to panic and yell, so he said slyly.\"Let me stay for a while, just a while... \"But would he be fine just staying for a while?Yaoniang blushed like blood in the darkness.She didn't know what to do. She couldn't push him away and didn't dare to call anyone... No, she wanted to shout but can't, because her tongue was still pressed lightly by him and she could only speak vaguely...Was he poisoned? What medicine did he take? Looking at his condition, was it the aphrodisiac? But who dared to let him take the aphrodisiac? Was it the Side Consort Hu?But why he just came to her instead of someone else.Yaoniang really couldn't understand.Knowing that she was terrified, Jing Wang stroked her tongue tip lightly but was attracted by the warm and tender touch, and he couldn't help but stroke it again.Her little tongue flickered from side to side and his finger followed up. Once he caught up, he would press firmly. After that, he should felt disgusted, but Jin Wang wanted to eat...He roared in his heart, and wanted to eat her.He turned Yaoniang over and saw her red cheeks. A pair of almond eyes was moist and bright, her small and well-shaped cherry mouth held his fingers. Some transparent things were flowing from the corner of her mouth uncontrollably...He licked fiercely and finally felt better than before.Jin Wang was not completely inexperienced. In the border town barracks, a group of men gathered together to say blue jokes. Others were afraid of his identity and majesty, and they didn't dare talk to him about blue jokes, but he even heard them more than once...He knows that the small mouth of a woman can make a man be happy. It is a state of bliss, so he sucked it hardly.Sure enough it was delicious, sweet and fragrant. It would be better if he could do more.Yaoniang felt that her soul was almost sucked up, and her whole person was confused and nervous.She was a little shy and a little scared, but more was a desire. All kinds of sweet and bitter tastes were mixed with his breath, and then turned into a poison she couldn't cure...She was in a daze and felt like a puddle of water. But some pictures of her previous life appeared in her mind, and she saw Xiao Bao's face.Yaoniang was sober as if she was struck by lightning.Unlike before, Jin Wang wanted a bit more and began to rub her chest with his big hands, which made her feel painful.Jing Wang was soaking in it, but she gave him a sudden push.Jin Wang looked like a demon under the hazy moonlight. His long hair was loose, and his clothes were half-stretched with naked chest. Looking further down, there was a high tent in his undershirts.No one knows better than Yaoniang about how strong Jin Wang is.She quickly looked away as if she was scalded.\"My Highness, no, no... \"She couldn't say it out.Jin Wang squinted at her, and she couldn't guess what he was thinking from his eyes. But his disdainful demeanor and rare wilderness were showing to Yaoniang that nothing is impossible for him.There was a hint of impatience on his face, and it seemed that he was about to pounce on her.His eyesight made Yaoniang want to hide, but she knew she couldn't hide and she had to find a way.There was a flash of lightning across her mind, and Yaoniang's face was even redder and her eyes were more moister. She clenched her hands tightly and said nervously, \"My Highness, you said that you were poisoned and I know how to treat it.\"Hearing this, Jin Wang raised his eyebrows lightly. No one in the Jin Wang Mansion could cure this poison, how could she cure it?Yaoniang knew Jin Wang didn't believe her. Her eyelashes couldn't stop shaking and she clenched her hands, \"I have an idea, but please, my Highness, please don't force me... I, I have a son at home and I still want to go back... \" Then, she wanted to cry again, but tried hard to hold back tears.Her teardrops hung on the curled eyelashes, as if the petal was covered with morning dew. Jin Wang stared at her teardrops, and had an urge to lick them away.Yaoniang didn't dare to delay. She lowered her head with a red face, and then pushed Jin Wang down on the bed.A shadow floated over, and even the moon in the sky was so shy that covered its face....Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Because his master met a woman secretly, he acted like a thief and didn't want to be seen by others. This was really a tragedy for him.It's Jin Wang Mansion here. He can enter every place casually except Siyi Courtyard in the Mansion.Fucheng couldn't hear the movement inside, so he became anxious and wanted to tear the door with his hands.He was afraid that the poison in Jin Wang's body would attack the heart, and that the little wet nurse would rather die than submit, and then it would be a joke. He was even more afraid that Jin Wang would be in big trouble if the little wet nurse couldn't cure him.Fucheng became more anxious when he thought of it.He couldn't help coming down the steps and looking over the roof.There was nothing on the roof, but the faint silver moonlight on the black tiles. Fucheng booed twice against the roof, and a man in dark came to him in the blink of an eye, it was Anshi.Anshi had been squatting on the roof, and he was very well hidden so that others didn't see him.\"What's going on inside?\"Anshi said coldly, \"I did not uncover tiles.\"\"Why not do it?\"Fucheng said in a very low voice, and was exasperated walking back and forth for a few moments.Anshi ignored him.\"You should uncover the tiles and see what happened inside. With this, we can know in advance even if something happens to the Highness.\" Fucheng said and repeated over and over again.Xi Anshi would not be fooled by him. Of course, he uncovered the tiles and also saw the scene inside. But he would never say it out, because he couldn't bear Fucheng's curiosity. If the Highness knew he revealed his private affairs, he would definitely punish him hardly.So Anshi became more indifferent.But who was Fucheng? He was clever and also knew the personalities of Anshi. As a dark guard around Jin Wang, he had always protected him.Then there was only one reason--\"Did he make it?\u201dAnshi was about to leave.\"Tell me please! Yes or no?\"As soon as he turned round, he was caught by Fucheng, \"You can't leave today unless you tell me.\"Ansi was so annoying. Thinking about the situation inside, he thought that the Highness got her in success And then he nodded.Fucheng showed a smirk.Oh! The little wet nurse had such good luck and she must be blessed by her ancestors.His Highness finally found someone\u00a0 to sleep with.It is just dawning and only a little faint light shines into the room through the window sash.It is still dark in the room.Jin Wang leaned halfway on the bedside with his eyes narrowed slightly and he stroked Yaoniang's long hair. Yaoniang lay down beside him and her eyes closed tightly, as if she was asleep.Suddenly, she pushed Jin Wang. However, she didn't get up and was still lying there, and her voice seemed to come out of her throat.\"My Highness, it's time for you to leave, and it is not good to be seen by others.\"Jin Wang did not speak.Yaoniang was so discouraged that she couldn't wait to throw him up immediately.She felt that she indeed made trouble for herself last night. She just didn't want to have sex with Jin Wang, but she simply forgot that Jin Wang was so vigorous. She served him twice all night, but now she couldn't feel her own hands, and it was sore and numb.\"It will be so difficult for me to stay here if someone saw us together. You promised me well last night.\" Yaoniang couldn't help but sit up.The question is, will a man keep his word when he said on bed?Obviously, Yaoniang didn't understand this truth and also wanted to persuade Jin Wang to leave quickly, but Jin Wang, like a lame big cat, lay there lazily, licked Yaoniang's hands and hairs from time to time. He didn't have a plan to leave.Yaoniang was about to cry.Seeing her anxiety, Jin Wang thought of her hard work last night and didn't want to embarrass her, so he sat up straight. He turned to see her sitting on knees, wearing a sandalwood underpants and exposing a red ribbon from the white neck, which made him remind of what happened last night.She grasped lappets tightly and didn't let him see, but she couldn't stop him with such a small strength. So Jin Wang not only saw but also tasted it.He did not feel sick, but felt very delicious.After that, Jin Wang was in a good mood and was extremely easy-going. Then he got out of the bed and put his shirt on.Yaoniang didn't get down and sat there with her head down.Actually she should serve Jin Wang to dress, but she was not the concubine of Jin Wang. Yaoniang always kept this in mind, so she didn't move.She waited for Jin Wang to leave, but Jin Wang stood still in front of the bed, and looked at her, which made her a little creepy.Yaoniang licked her lips and was about to say something, but she was suddenly covered by a dark shadow. The room was dark and she felt something was put on her ankle before she could react, then Jin Wang left.When she heard the door close, she relaxed her tight body. Subconsciously she reached out to touch her ankle, and touched a chain.She lifted her trouser legs, and then saw a gold chain around her snow-white slender ankle. It is about one finger wide and has a five-clawed golden dragon on it.Yaoniang was startled.She saw this chain before, and it was tied to Jin Wang's purse in usual. There must be something important in the purse and Jin Wang never allowed anyone to touch it. Even if she served him personally in her previous life, she did not dare to touch it at will.In an unintentional situation, Yaoniang knew that it was the Jin Wang's seal in the purse.But why did he loop this chain on her ankle?Although Yaoniang didn't know much, she also knew that the five-clawed golden dragon pattern couldn't be used randomly. According to the rules of the Qian Dynasty, the five-clawed golden dragon is only available to the emperor and the prince.What exactly did Jin Wang mean? Did he reward this to her because she served well? Or something else? But even if he wanted to reward her, she should not reward this noble gift to her.Yaoniang tried to unlock the gold chain, but she failed. She tried to drag it again, and the chain was as heavy as an iron stone so that she couldn't move it at all.As a result, she had no choice but to look at this dazzling chain in the dim, and was wondering for a long time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His legs and feet couldn't move smoothly, and he almost fell over when he stood up. Seeing this, Jin Wang reached out to hold him, then he stood firm.\"My Highness.\" Fucheng smiled with embarrassment.Jin Wang nodded, and they left quietly along the way they came in last night.Fucheng looked at his master who was in high spirit with stretched eyebrows, and knew that Wet Nurse Su served him very well last night, otherwise the Highness would not be like this.Fucheng felt that he must be considerate as a nice servant, and then he asked, \"My Highness, will you arrange a new place for Wet Nurse Su?\" After all, she couldn't serve the little princess while serving Jin Wang.Hearing this, Jin Wang hesitated for a moment before he said, \"No.\"Fucheng was a little bit surprised at Jin Wang's response, didn't his Highness want to be responsible for her? He stared at Jin Wang's back with a very surprised look, until Jin Wang got angry.The rare good mood was suddenly destroyed, and Jin Wang remembered that the little wet nurse served him with grievances last night.Jin Wang couldn't understand grievances of Yaoniang. In order to not having sex with him, she would rather serve him in a different way than have sex with him.Did she preserve chastity after the death of her husband? Did she do it for her dead man?Jin Wang was unhappy when he thought of this, so he was even angry with Fucheng.However, he had always showed an indifferent face, and Fucheng was out of mind, so he didn't find anything wrong. They quietly returned to Zhaohui Hall while taking advantage of the morning light.Yaoniang sat on the bed for a while after Jin Wang left.She changed all the bedding and quietly took them to the water well for washing when it was almost dawn.There was no one here in the Back Room. It was still early, and they didn't get up.Yaoniang fetched water from the well, and put the quilt into the water and also her pajamas that were used to dry his body off by Jin Wang yesterday. Until all these things were soaked in water, the unspeakable smell at her nose finally faded.There was no one here, but she flushed with shame. She soaked the soiled areas with water and rubbed them with soap vigorously. Someone got up while she was washing.They were Madam Wang and Madam Zhao.People in the small kitchen get up early every day, because they have to prepare breakfast in advance, so that other people will have breakfast after getting up.Seeing Yaoniang squatting by the well to wash clothes at this time, they were very surprised.\"Wet Nurse Su, why are you here so early?\"Yaoniang got up so early and washed these things in the pot, this naturally made them feel surprised. No one would wash their bedding early in the morning.Yaoniang blushed and could not find an excuse.But they thought Yaoniang was about to speak but say nothing. it was normal for a woman to have a menstrual period every month and they could understand that she sometimes the bedding would be dirty.Madam Zhao said with a smile, \"You can wash them at any time, but why you choose to wash in the early morning.\"Madam Wang interrupted, \"You can't wash them clean with cold water. I'll fetch some hot water for you when the water is boiling.\u201dThey opened the kitchen door and soon got busy working inside. After a while, Xiangcao and Xiangxiang also got up, and they were both surprised to see Yaoniang washing the bedding so early.Yaoniang felt that she should not wash the bedding at this time, and it was a very poor lie which revealed the truth. But it was too late, she could only squat to continue washing under their curious eyesight. Xiangcao and other little girls also said that they would help her, but she rejected.Maybe others didn't know, however, as long as she thought about others helping wash that kind of thing, she would have a sense of shame.Finally she finished washing, and Madam Zhao also came out to help her wring up. The begging was too big and she couldn't wring it up by her own.\"It's a sunny today, and they will be dry in the late morning.\"Yaoniang thanked Madam Zhao and then returned to her room.At this time, everyone got up, and the small lateral yard became lively.Yaoniang was out of her mind all the morning until Xiangcao came to find her.Because Xiangcao had something to tell Yaoniang, then Yaoniang told Yucui and took Xiangcao to her room.\"Wet Nurse Su, I've helped you find it out. The brother of my little sister is a groom at Chariot and Horse Center in the Mansion. He is from Hongyuan County and goes home every two months. He will go through Linyun County and it's not a big deal to help you take things back.\"Yaoniang was a little surprised, \"Thank you, Xiangcao. But will it be too troublesome for him?\"Xiangcao waved her hand lightly, \"It's not troublesome, and just a help. Besides, you are the wet nurse of the little princess, many people are willing to run errands for you.\"Xiangcao didn't care, but Yaoniang couldn't get used to it.Because she wanted to take some things back home from the Mansion in her previous life, but she couldn't find anyone help her. This was due to her unfamiliarity with the situation of the Mansion and her poor popularity. Everyone avoided her like seeing a viper, and naturally no one wanted to make contact with her. After she became a concubine of Jin Wang and Consort Jin supported her, the servants were willing to fawn on her.Unexpectedly, just being a wet nurse of the little princess in this life, there were so many people rushing to run errands for her, and it was true that the affairs of the world are inconstant..Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In short, it was because she didn't have a positive attitude to life. Even if she was doted by Jin Wang and the servants fawned on her, but actually they thought in the bottom of their hearts that she seduced Jin Wang. She was despised and disgusted.This was probably a fundamental difference between taking a short cut and supporting herself on her own.\"By the way, Wet Nurse Su, I forgot to tell you. Brother Zhousheng will go home this afternoon. If you have something to bring back, then prepare in advance.\" Xiangcao said enthusiastically and broke Yaoniang's meditation.Yaoniang came to her sense.She didn't expect it was so quick, but\u00a0 she was very happy when she thought her family might receive her things in the next two days. Xiangcao told her to come to her after lunch and then went back to the kitchen, while Yaoniang rushed to prepare things happily.Yaoniang prepared a pack of things, and she still thought about bringing more things home when she went to work in the small building.She had only fifteen liang silvers left, and intended to bring those all home, as well as her clothes rewarded by Jin Wang. Her figure was about as the same as her sister. She could wear it, so could her sister. Those two clothes were made from good material, and her sister could wear them when she visited relatives.And the two dresses for Xiao Bao were made from the material left. Last time, she made the clothes for the little princess and Mammy Mu gave the rest cloth to her, so she made clothes for Xiao Bao.The two clothes were in season, and she had already prepared them well..But she still didn't feel enough, she wanted to bring everything home, so she would feel more at ease.The little princess was asleep after having lunch, and then Yaoniang asked for a leave with Yuyan. She came to Xiangcao and asked her to find the person who helped her bring things home.Xiangcao took Yaoniang to the side gate of the Mansion, and Zhousheng was already waiting there.He was not very old and looked like twenty years old. He had dark skin and was tall and strong. At first glance, he was an honest young man.It was very hot at noon, but he didn't stay in shade but standing under the sun. She saw him sweating from a distance.Xiangcao smiled helplessly at Yaoniang and ran over, \"Brother Zhousheng, why are you standing here? Have you been waiting for a long time?\"Zhousheng wiped the sweat and smiled at Xiangcao, \"It is not long, and I am just here. I'm afraid you won't see me, so I'm standing still. By the way, is she Wet Nurse Su?\" Zhousheng said with some hesitation while Yaoniang was approaching him.There was a hint of surprise in his eyes when seeing Yaoniang from a distance.The skin of Yaoniang was fair and limpid under the sun and radiated a kind of glistening light. Zhousheng had never seen such a beautiful woman because he used to work with men and the women he could see were maids and old madams.Not to mention the appearance of Yaoniang, Zhousheng felts amazing about her fair skin. It was very soft and delicate he had never touched.After Yaoniang approached, Zhousheng saw Yaoniang's face and lowered his head with a red face. Fortunately, no one questioned the flushing because the weather was too hot.\"Wet Nurse Su. He is Brother Zhousheng.\"Yaoniang smiled and said, \"Brother Zhou, Thanks for your help, and I am sorry to trouble you.\"\"No trouble at all. It's my pleasure.\" Zhousheng smirked and couldn't help but scratch his head, \"If you want to bring something home, just give them to me and I promise I will send them to your family safely.\" He patted his chest and made a promise.Yaoniang handed him the bag and said, \"It's just some silvers and some clothes.\"She repeated the words that she wanted to tell her family and also Yao family's detailed address twice. She felt relieved after being sure that he remembered well.\"Anyway, thank you, Brother Zhou. You can take these silvers to have a tea.\" Yaoniang took out a piece of silver from her sleeve and put it into Zhousheng's hands.Zhousheng refused immediately. \"No, Thank you, Wet Burse Su, you really don't need to be so polite, thanks\u2026 \" He was afraid that Yaoniang would continue to put silver in his hands and then ran away with the baggage quickly.\"Wet Nurse Su, don't worry. If your family has something to tell you, I will advise you later.\" He waved hands and say goodbye to her in a distant place.Yaoniang watched him leave, and said to Xiangcao, \"Brother Zhou is a very nice person.\"\"Brother Zhousheng is indeed a very good person, and you don't know him... \"At that time, Yaoniang received rewards from Jin Wang and said that she would invite people in the lateral yard to drink and eat.She didn't know how to arrange, so she gave the money to Madam Mo and asked her to set a schedule. It was today.The people in the small kitchen began to prepare food this afternoon.At dinner time, people in the lateral yard were here except Wet Nurse Wang and Wet Nurse Qian who were taking care of the little princess and Mammy Mu who didn't like crowds.It was just the time when the disc-like moon hung in the night sky. The yard in front of the back room was brightly lit and three round tables were placed on the open space.The dishes were very rich and most of them were made with the food material in the small kitchen. Only meat dishes and wines were bought by Yaoniang's silvers. Therefore, although Yaoniang gave Mammy Mo fifteen liang silvers, but it only took less than ten liang silvers, and Mammy Mo gave the remaining silvers to her. She said to Yaoniang that it was not easy to work outside and she lost her man but a baby in cradle, so it was better for her to save more money.Yaoniang didn't say anything, but she was really moved.All these madams were good at drinking, and they could let other little girls, however, for the host, Yaoniang, they forced her to drink a few drinks.Yaoniang was not good at drinking and cannot hold the drink after a few drinks.Anyway, she was almost full, so found an excuse to leave.She returned to the front yard from the corner gate, and it was very quiet different from the lively back room. Yaoniang wanted to take a bathe, but thinking of the lively scene over the back room, she might disturb them if she went there again. In addition, there was more than half a basin of clean water that she just prepared in the afternoon, so she wiped herself with cold water, and lay down after changing clothes.She slept for a while and suddenly woke up for her thirst. She shuffled her embroidered shoes and went to drink water at the table.After taking two sips, she was caught by someone from behind suddenly.She turned around to see Jin Wang's handsome face, and suddenly became sober.\"My Highness, my Highness, why are you here?\"\"I miss you, so I am here.\"\"It's very late and quiet now. You should go back to rest... \"She was frightened by Jin Wang's actions so that she couldn't speak anymore.Jin Wang went to the bedside and sat down like a master.Yaoniang tried to endure it, but she did not hold back, \"My Highness, there was a reason yesterday, so I... and you promised me that just once last night. You can't eat your words... \"In the end, she was almost in tears.Yaoniang was anxious. She thought about it for a day that Jin Wang wouldn't let her go so easily after putting a chain on her ankle.Sure enough!Jin Wang frowned, \"Have I said that?\"Yaoniang was stunned and thought for a while, then said, \"Although you haven't say it, you didn't speak anything when I said it to you then.\" Keeping silence meant that he\u00a0 tacitly agreed it. It was Jin Wang's natural instincts and also Yaoniang's cognition about Jin Wang.Jin Wang blinked his eyes, \"I don't agree, so I didn't speak then.\"Yaoniang was dumbfounded.He behaved like a hoodlum. How raffish he was!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I am just a widow and have a son. It's not worth of you to... \"Jin Wang glanced at her, \"It's up to me not you to judge it.\"Yaoniang blushed.After a long while, she finally plucked up the courage to say, \"But I don't want.\"Jin Wang squinted at her, \"Why? Is it because of your dead man?\"Hearing this, Yaoniang stunned and then shook her head subconsciously, \"Anyway, I am not willing to do it and you can't force a good woman. I didn't sell myself to the Jin Wang Mansion, so I am still the daughter of a good family.\"\"Come here!\"\"My Highness, you cannot... \"\"Do you come here or not?\"Jin Wang looked very horrible with a perfectly straight face, and now it was totally different from his usual cold face. Yaoniang was almost about to cry, and she came over helplessly before she could react.When she got closer, Jin Wang pulled her into his arms and let her sit on his lap. One hand looped around her slender waist, and the other hand clung to underneath his hem with her hand.Yaoniang felt its heat and wanted to take it back, but her hand was pressed by him firmly.\"I forgot to tell you that the poison in my body couldn't be cured at one time.\" Jin Wang looked serious, but his hand is holding Yaoniang's little white hand to rub himself over and over again.Yaoniang said in a tremulous voice, \"Then how many, how many times?\"Jin Wang squinted at the stupid little wet nurse and said, \"I need to find an antidote.\"\"When will you find an antidote?\"\"I am not sure, maybe a year or more.\"Yaoniang suddenly had a feeling of a dark cloud upon her head. For a long time, she said with embarrassment, \"You have a wife and concubines, so you can find them and it is really not worthwhile... \"\"Do I need you to tell me how to do?\"Yaoniang stopped talking helplessly.Jin Wang didn't seem to be satisfied with this and glanced at Yaoniang for a few times, but Yaoniang didn't pay attention to it at this moment, and naturally she didn't see his eyes.Jin Wang suddenly realized that they should be consensual about sex.He cleared his throat and said, \"Don't you say you still want to go home? If you serve me well, I will let you go home after one year.\"\"Really?\" At this time, Yaoniang just thought that Jin Wang did not intend to let her go, so she naturally ignored the trap in his words.\"Of course, it is true.\" Jin Wang nodded meaningfully and gave her a glance up and down, \"Not only that, I will also reward you with a large sum of money, and it will be enough for you to spend the rest of your life in peace.\"Yaoniang's brain worked quickly.In fact, she was not easy to coax. Although she was not smart, she was not stupid and knew that she couldn't refuse Jin Wang at all. Probably Jin Wang liked her a little, so he coaxed and tolerated her especially. If she was not well-behaved and continued to reject, he would definitely become very angry with her.Yaoniang was dumbfounded while thinking of it.How much Jin Wang liked her? Was this real?She couldn't help but glance at Jin Wang.In the dark, his handsome face was as smooth as a jade, her eyebrows were as arched as willows, and his eyes were as bright as stars. He was so handsome that she didn't dare to see again. There were little bubbles popped up from her heart, but all were shattered before they turned over.Su Yaoniang, don't think too much. Jin Wang just likes your body, not you.Love will declines because of an aging appearance. Once love declines and a love relationship will break up. How many years can he love you, or how long could his love last?She also thought of one year that Jin Wang said, and this one year must be the fresh period for Jin Wang. Presumably he would not care about herself any more after one year.That was the case--\"If that's the case, I agree. But you can or not, can or not... \" She gritted her teeth and said boldly, \"don't let others know about it. I just want to do my job well, and don't want other people know... \"Jin Wang kept silent and there was no expression on his face, but his eyes were dark.Yaoniang was so nervous and this was her bottom line. If others knew it, it meant that she would follow the old routine as her previous life. She had not figured out who killed her in her previous life, and she did not want to die an unnatural death again.In fact, Yaoniang had a kind of enlightenment in her heart that she couldn't escape after what happened to her yesterday.Since she couldn't escape, let it be. As long as Jin Wang lost interest in her, it was not difficult for her to leave.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

With a title of Jin Wang's woman, she had to stay in the Mansion and can only meet Xiao Bao secretly.Maybe such an idea made other women really shocked, but Yaoniang had lived for two lives and already abandoned to care what she once cared about.Anyway, she was not a virgin now, so was it shameful to have a relation with him? She just wanted to stay safely in the Mansion for a year and then went home to take care of her son for the rest of her life.Jin Wang did not speak, and Yaoniang suddenly felt scary.She didn't know why.When she was going to say something else, Jin Wang said with a smile, \"OK, I promise.\"His smile was like flowers blooming and was also like full of birds coming,\u00a0 it was very beautiful and seductive.Then Yaoniang was unable to think about why she reacted in that way, and why Jin Wang agreed so easily.Maybe she knew, but she didn't want to think deeply.Yaoniang felt that there was no end. She had helped Jin Wang once, but within a quarter of an hour, he took her hand again.His eyes were closed and there was sweat was on his forehead. When looking this scene, Yaoniang's sights could not help moving down.Her hands were already aching after helping him to relieve his desire.Actually, Yaoniang was ready this time. But Jin Wang had no idea at all and seemed to prefer her hands.Of course, it was not just her hands. He also kissed her little lips, and made her feel painful and even occasionally kissed somewhere else. However, he also kissed her in the previous life, Although Yaoniang felt shy about it, she wasn't too surprised.But that was all and no more something else.Yaoniang was deeply puzzled. She remembered that Jin Wang didn't act like this in the previous life.He stopped suddenly, and then Yaoniang immediately stopped confusedly.In the dark, Jin Wang frowned and stared at somewhere, as if there was something puzzling. Yaoniang followed his eyes to see, and her face turned redder immediately.Even she blushed but still wanted to see it. Seriously speaking, she just had seen it several times in the previous life when she served Jin Wang take a bath.How strong it was!\"My Highness... \"Jin Wang seemed to give up, and pulled Yaoniang over. Before Yaoniang could knew what was going on, she saw that his tall nose bridge was close, and he kissed her lips suddenly.Yaoniang had always been a very submissive woman, and would let him kiss her if he wanted. His kiss was strong and hastily, as if he was going to swallow her, especially at this time he had a vicious feeling. It seemed that he was really eager to relieve but failed. Yaoniang felt that her waist was about to break, and she could only climb his wide shoulders weakly.Because they were close, she felt his strong desire. Yaoniang moved a little further away lightly and was trying to stay away from him. But she was pulled back by Jin Wang once she moved an inch. Jin Wang seemed to know that it was more interesting like that, and he held her hands to lean on it.Hiss...Both of them could not help taking a deep breath, and Yaoniang immediately wanted to push him away, but he didn't let her do that and pressed her firmly. Yaoniang was not stronger than him, so she didn't resist and was trembling when touching his heat. Jin Wang seemed to feel interesting and unexpectedly he began to move up and down, and Yaoniang's soul almost flew out of the sky.Thirty minutes later, Yaoniang was soft and boneless. She cried and bit through her lower lips. Jin Wang had a sudden shake and finally stopped. He closed his eyes tightly, and breathed heavily. After a while, he looked down at her. Seeing that her cheeks were flushed, and a few hairs stuck on her sweating face and neck, it made him feel very uncomfortable. Her mouth was red and swollen.He reached out to shake off the hair, and touched the little red mouth with his finger, and then let her go down to wash herself.Looking at his back, Yaoniang got up weakly. She went behind the screen and wiped her face and body before she took off silk trousers and changed a clean one. Holding the silk trousers, she didn't even give a glance at i and just put it in the basin.Jin Wang was already lying on the couch when Yaoniang came out.He waved at her and she came to him. As soon as she sat down, she was pulled into his arms, and Jin Wang stroked her back with his big palm and said, \"You are very good.\"Yaoniang was almost choked by her saliva and felt a little weird.Jiang Wang said that she was very good like this. Did Jin Wang praise her in the extreme in his heart in the previous life?She thought for a while, and Yaoniang agreed what he said. Now that Jin Wang felt good, it meant that she served well, and could go home after one year.It was before dawn the next day. Jin Wang quietly left in the morning light. Just like last time, but he didn't take Fucheng to come here this time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

So she went home with money and met her elder sister, brother-in-law, and Xiao Bao.Xiao Bao learned to walk, and even could call her mother. Seeing this, Yaoniang smiled happily.At that moment, someone knocked at the door of the yard. She opened the door while answering, but saw Jin Wang standing outside the yard, and was holding a little boy who looked like him.The boy was obviously older than Xiao Bao and called her mother. She was startled and quickly said she was not his mother, because she only gave birth to one baby, Xiao Bao. The little boy sat on the ground and began to cry, while Jin Wang's face was as dark as ink, and said that she had no conscience, and even left their father and son to run away.Yaoniang felt wronged, and was still wondering if this was a conspiracy of Jin Wang. At this moment, she heard the knock...Yaoniang woke up immediately and burst out in perspiration. She was still a little stunned and looked out of the window, then found that it was bright outside.She hurried to open the door without hesitate.A'xia stood outside.\"Wet Nurse Su, I didn't see you in the morning, so I come here to call you.\"Yaoniang asked her in haste, \"What time is it now?\"A'xia was startled and then laughed, \"It is not the right time for you to go to work. I didn't see you to have breakfast just, so I come here to call you.\"Yaoniang exhaled suddenly, \"I slept so late yesterday that I forgot the time.\"Axia glanced at her, \"So it is, your eyes are red. By the way, what's wrong with your mouth?\"Yaoniang touched her lips subconsciously, and it was obviously different from usual, with a slight sting. She faked a smile, \"I haven't found it before you asked me. Maybe I was bit by mosquito, and it is a little painful.\" Then, she rubbed her lips, \"I have to freshen up quickly so as not to be late for work.\"A'xia nodded, \"OK, I'll bring your breakfast.\" Then, she ran away before Yaoniang said no.Yaoniang shook her head with a smile and returned to the room.In the mirror, Yaoniang's face was full of laziness, and there was a hint of charm at the corner of her eyes. Her eye circles were slightly red, and her lips were swollen, which looked attractive and made someone covet them.Yaoniang rubbed her face and went behind the screen.Because of the hot weather and the inconvenience of taking a bath at night, Yaoniang put two wooden barrels in the room. A barrel with a lid was filled with clean water and the other was filled with dirty water, and she changed the water every day. Yaoniang opened the wooden barrel, and there was still half a bucket of water, so she scooped it into the washbasin.Fortunately, there was some water in the barrel, otherwise, Yaoniang didn't know what to do these days. She couldn't go out to fetch water in the middle of the night, because it would made her embarrassed.Thinking of this, and somehow she remembered what happened last night. Yaoniang blushed and felt that her face was very hot.Yaoniang washed her face face and rinsed her mouth, and then went to the dressing table to comb her hair. She coiled her pinch-black thick hair and finally made a sole bun on the back of her head, and then held it with a wooden hairpin. She wanted to make a bang, but she felt troublesome. Before this, she didn't want to be noticed, however, now everything had happened, and it seemed to be nothing to hide.As soon as Yaoniang combed her hair, A'xia walked in with a tray.Breakfast was very simple, white rice porridge, mushroom and green cabbage buns, and a plate of pickles and a plate of stir-fried vegetables.Yaoniang expressed her thanks to A'xia.A'xia looked at her in amazement, \"Wet Nurse Su, you're so pretty.\"Yaoniang touched her face subconsciously, and smiled a little embarrassed, \"Really? I don't think so.\"A'xia nodded again and again, \"Of course, I think you should not make any bangs in the future, because the bangs make you look not beautiful.\" Even a little ugly, but A'xia didn't say it out.\"So it is, I've never noticed this before, and I won't do it in the future.\"Then, A'xia said something to her before leaving.Yaoniang came to the table for breakfast.Because she didn't have much time and also was very hungry, she finished breakfast very fast. After that, she cleaned the table and sent the dishes to the small kitchen before going to the small building.It was a little late when she arrived, but no one said anything. Yaoniang was always a hardworking person and everyone knew her during these day, so they wouldn't say some bad words to her because she was occasionally late.Wet Nurse Wang and Wet Nurse Qian left quickly, and let Yaoniang, Yuyan and Yucui here. During the period, Yuyan went out for something, so there were only Yaoniang and Yucui.At this moment, Lvyao came in and said, \"Eunuch Fu is here.\"With her voice, Fucheng came in and he came to visit the little princess instead of Jin Wang.Yucui didn't think much about it, because the Highness hadn't been here for a few days. Only Yaoniang was uneasy, and was afraid that Fucheng would say something. After all, she also listened to the movement outside the day before yesterday, and knew that Fecheng was always outside on the day when Jin Wang came to her. Therefore, she was extremely timorous to face Fucheng.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After Yucui went out, he looked at Yaoniang with a smile and said, \"Wet Nurse Su, the Highness asked me to send you something.\"He took out a small porcelain pot from his sleeve while speaking.\"It's the best medicine to treat traumas and you can apply it on the mouth, and it doesn't matter if you eat it.\"Yaoniang flushed with shame and was too embarrassed to lift her head. She took it and said, \"Thank you, Eunuch Fu.\"The more Fucheng looked at her, the more he looked like pleasing, and then he said with a smile, \"No thanks, then I leave first.\"Fucheng went outside and just met Yucui with a cup of tea.\"Eunuch Fu, your tea.\"\"No need. I have to go now.\"Yucui came in with the tea and said to Yaoniang, \"Eunuch Fu is so strange today. How can he leave without drinking a cup of tea?\"Yaoniang's eyes flickered, and she unconsciously touched the small porcelain pot in her sleeve, and did not speak.Yaoniang went back to the room during working hours, and took out the small porcelain pot from her sleeve.The small porcelain pot was pinkish white overall, and the glazed surface\u00a0 had fine openings. The texture was like a jade and was very exquisite. Yaoniang opened it and saw a turquoise translucent pasty fluid. She dipped some with her fingertips and rubbed them on the back of her hands. It was cool and comfortable.She unfastened her clothes, and bit her lower lip, then shyly wiped medicine on two nipples. The hotness and slight tingling disappeared suddenly. Jin Wang was so greedy yesterday that he sucked it heavily.After Yaoniang rubbed on several places on her body, she unfastened her dress and saw the red marks on the both sides. She blushed and applied medicine on it. After that, she hurriedly put on clothes and finally rubbed some on lips.She hoped he wouldn't come again tonight, or she couldn't stand it.The Yao's family was located in Huaishu alley, Linyun County, and\u00a0 it seemed that there was something bad happening here now.In the west chamber, Mrs. Li's scolding could be heard from time to time.Because Mrs. Li lowered her voice, it sounded a little vague from the outside, but Huiniang didn't need to listen to it and knew what her mother-in-law was scolding.The unmarried Yan'er was pregnant secretly. As long as she thought of it, Huiniang had an inexplicable joy.She was not gloating, but she couldn't help becoming hated whenever she thought of her young sister who had gone to Jincheng. She hated Mrs. Li and Yan'er. Especially after Yaoniang left, Yan'er egged Mrs. Li to propose a marriage to Chenan's family. Huiniang finally understood why Mrs. Li wanted her sister to leave.So they deserved that. They were hoisted by their own petard.Chenan's family didn't agree. Feng Heizi raped Yan'er and they proposed a marriage to the Li's family. But Mrs. Li disliked that Feng Heizi had a poor family, and also had a widom mother, so she rejected it. Also, Yan'er was not willing to marry him.Huiniang usually looked on coldly, but couldn't help criticizing in heart. You could look down upon the Feng's family, but was your daughter qualified to do like that? Yan'er couldn't stay at home all her life and she must marry someone in the future.Thinking of this, Huiniang stood up and went out to the west chamber.Mrs. Li stopped scolding when she saw Huiniang. In fact, she cared about her face, but she always put on airs in front of Huiniang and she didn't want to be looked down upon by Huiniang.Huiniang laughingly looked at Yan'er, who was sitting on a chair and lowered her head because she was\u00a0 scolded by Mrs. Li.\"Yan'er, you shouldn't be stubborn now in such a situation. You are pregnant with Peng Heizi, are you still planning to marry Chenan?\" That depended on whether Chenan wanted to marry you, but Huiniang didn't speak it out. In fact, she felt that Chenan was a good match for her own young sister, but unfortunately, this vicious girl, Yan'er destroyed their marriage.Huiniang's words were just like a knife inserted in Yan'er's heart, and she suddenly covered her face and began to cry.Mrs. Li. had always shielded Yan'er and couldn't bear Huiniang to say his daughter like this. Then she jumped three feet high and said angrily, \"Su Huiniang, I tell you, don't bully Yan'er... \"Huiniang interrupted her, \"Mom, you really think too much. No one will give me money, why do I bully her?\"The words that \"no one gave me money\" were said by Mrs. Li usually. But Huiniang said it at this time, and it sounded quite ridiculous.However, Huiniang said before Mrs. Li scolded, \"Mom, you always say that Yaoniang is shameless to be pregnant before she married and is a scandal to the Yao's family. Now Yan'er is pregnant secretly and it is indeed not a good thing, so you shouldn't be so stubborn that you don't let Yan'er marry Feng Heizi. Don't forget that Chenan is a catcher, but he is respectable in the village. Ming'er is not young and will go to the private school after two years. Your two grandsons are more important to Yao family, if outsiders know that they have such an aunt... \"Huiniang did not finish speaking, but Mrs. Li and Yan'er understood it.Although Mrs. Li made a lot of troubles, she cared much about Ming'er and Hong'er. One side was her two grandsons and the other side was her rebellious daughter, so did she need to make a choice?Maybe Mrs. Li couldn't make a decision now, but she would figure out finally.Yan'er also understood that and suddenly cried, \"Mom, I won't marry him! You don't let me marry, then I really don't want to marry... \"Mrs. Li was very confused and scolded her subconsciously, \"It's a joke that I don't want you to marry. I say that and just create difficulties to the Feng's family. You can't take it seriously. If you don't marry, where do you want to go? Damn girl... \"Huiniang already walked out from the west chamber, and she couldn't help smiling when she heard the scoldings behind her.Yaoyao, I could only help you like this. How were you now?\u3000Why didn't you ask someone to deliver a message back?Huiniang decided to go to the Wang's family and to learn if they had news about her young sister after her husband came back. Her young sister had been out for nearly two months and didn't ask anyone to deliver a message. She didn't know whether Yaoniang was good or not now.At this moment, there was a knock on the yard door suddenly.\"Is anyone there?\"\"Who is it?\" Huiniang answered.Suddenly there was no more movement in the west chamber, and Mrs. Li quickly raised the curtain and came out.\"Someone asked me to bring back something to your family, and her surname is Su... \"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I'm bringing something back for Su Nai Niang. Besides, she asked me to send you a message.Are you Su Nai Niang's eldest sister? \u201dHuiniang quickly nodded and said,\u00a0 \u201cI am Yaoyao's eldest sister. Come on, please come in and sit down, it's really trouble you. Is my sister okay now?\u201dZhousheng thought,it turns out that she has such a nice name, Yaoyao. He read the name several times in his heart, and then followed Huiniang to go inside while distractedly answering her words.Zhousheng was ushered into the hall, a bowl of tea after drinking, Huiniang also almost figured out the situation of Yaoniang.Huiniang learned that her sister had become the wet nurse of princess, and she was doing well in the house,was not bullied,. It is said that she was very popular in front of the master. After hearing the news, Hui Niang couldn't help crying.Zhousheng didn't understand why Huiniang would cry like this, his eyes were a bit surprised.Huiniang reacted and wiped her tears in a hurry, saying, \"My sister is introverted and timid. This is the first time she has gone abroad, so it is inevitable to worry.\"Zhousheng nodded to express his understanding.After that, Zhousheng gave the burden to Huiniang, especially silver (the ancient Chinese currency) gave it to her face-to-face, and finally spoke to her, \"Su Nai Niang said she was very good in the Wang Mansion, so she didn't have to worry. Su Nai Niang also said that letting the elder sister take these Yinzi to buy a little girl, or hire someone to come back to help with the work, so as not to get tired.\"In fact, the latter sentence is what Yaoniang wanted to say. Lishi was lazy. Hui Niang looked after her three children alone. How could she be so busy, you can imagine what it would be like to make Huiniang tired. Yaoniang was worried about this every night in the Wang Mansion.\"Thank you, Zhou, I'll figure this out. You can help me bring her a sentence. Just let her work well in the Wang Mansion, don't worry about home, Xiao Bao is very good, and now has learned to turn over and eat\u00a0 so fat ... \"Huiniang said a lot, before she was willing to send Zhousheng out of the house. She left Zhousheng to eat at home, but Zhousheng had to rush back, saying that there would be such opportunities in the future. Huiniang thought that this young man was really kind-hearted, and thanks again and again, watched Zhousheng leave in a carriage.She stood at the door for a while before returning to the house. As soon as she entered the door, she saw her mother-in-law checking the baggage returned by Yaoniang.Lishi is carrying a red Beizi(In the name of the one kind of clothes in ancient China), his hands like chicken paws rubbing back and forth on smooth cloth.Huiniang's eyebrows have been jumping, there is always a feeling that the clothes will be touched by Lishi. At the same time, she was also glad that Zhousheng had given her the silver directly, otherwise, if the silver fell in Lishi\u2019s hands, it would definitely not come back.\"Zezeze, Su Yaoniang really made a fortune. Such a good material can be used to make clothes. I has lived for so many years and hasn't seen such a good material,\"Lishi's mouth sucked again and again, she held The clothes were drawn on the body and said to Huiniang, \"I think this dress is suitable for me. It should be Su Yaoniang's respect for me.\"Huiniang looked at that red BeiZi with flowers, and then looked at Lishi's old face,she couldn't think of how Lishi could get a statement that was very suitable to wear.When Lishi was talking,Yan'er standing by the door was a little bit jealous, so she interjected,\"Mon, I'm going to marry someone soon. Give me this dress. \"These two shameless women! Hui Niang was so angry that her lips were trembling, and she was about to say something. Suddenly, there was a loud bang outside, as if someone had knocked the door of the courtyard hard.Before the three people reacted, there was a cry outside the door,\"Yao Yan'er, you're a Evil essence, you have to compensate my son\u2014 \"This voice belongs to Widow Feng.Huiniang felt that something bad happened, and hurried out. Lishi also followed in a hurry, and saw that Widow Feng stood in front of the gate and scolded, followed by a lot of people watching the lively.Widow Feng is not the one to be trifled with! She is a widow who can bring up a son, it is conceivable that she must not be a kind person.The reason why Lishi\u2019s reluctance to be a relative with Widow Feng was not only because the feng family was poor which is a famous bust nearby, but also because the widow feng was too brash. She once suffered numerous losses from Widow Feng, so when Widow Feng said good words and asked to come to the door, how could she agree, she wished to get back the wrongs she had suffered in her early years.Lishi has always been fierce. Seeing Widow Feng scolding her baby daughter like this, how could Lishi easily let her go, and quarrel with each other as soon as she jumped three feet high.\"You are a poisonous widow, you killed the life of a family, You're such an idiot, you are the evil essence, your all family is the evil essence ... \"Widow Feng sat down on the ground, patting her thigh and wailing,\"oh, my god, open your eyes and see what kind of people are in this family.The girl from her family relied on my son's liking, so she didn't treat people as human beings and played with her to death. They despised my poor family, and despised my poor widow's life. But can I choose this life? I , Widow Feng, have keeping the chaste and undefiled all my life. Everyone praise me.Only this family has no conscience at all, always saying that I have killed a family ... \"Widow Feng should not have done this for the first time, it was full of singing, reading, making, and proofing. The crying and cursing were sullen and frustrated. Her tears ran down, making people sad when they looked at them, and they also shed tears when they listened. Although Qian dynasty couldn't help widows remarrying, if any widows with a sacred ethics appeared, every would\u00a0 look at her with quite different eyes.The onlookers were already in an uproar, and Lishi's usual behavior was not good, so someone would speak for Widow Feng.\"We are the neighborhood, why should we make such an embarrassment, one step back, it will be over. \"Some people persuade.At the sight of this, Widow Feng became more energetic,\"It's not that my family didn't want to make concessions. Before that, I still went out to ask for marriage. It was the Yao who was so unreasonable that they forced my son to go out to earn money, which caused my son to commit an accident, and was arrested by the officer in prison... I don\u2019t care, you return my son! Yao Yan'er, If anything happens to my son, I, widow Feng,won't let you go even as a ghost ... \"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What did he do?Don't look at Lishi's usual arrogance\uff0c in fact, Yan'er also can't get through that hole in her heart and has been arguing not to marry Feng Heizi. But when Feng Heizi had an accident, the two of them couldn't help feeling anxious.What should happen to the child in Sister Yan's belly if something goes wrong with Feng Heizi? Isn't the child a fatherless one?Widow Feng saw that her opponent had just gone stunned, there was a flash of pride in her eyes, and she continued to cry,\"My poor grandson, your father had an accident before you were born. Now your dad doesn\u2019t know whether it \u2019s dead or alive... Oh, God, why don\u2019t you open your eyes, why don\u2019t bless us... \"The information in Widow Feng's words was too great, and many people could not respond at the first time, and they all couldn't help looking at Yan Yan's belly.Lishi was very angry and wanted to beat Widow Feng out. But she was afraid that the widow Feng would say anything unpleasant, and she also wanted to find out what happened to the Heizi, so she had to rush out the people standing in her yard.\"Go go go, what are you looking at? There is nothing worth watching. \"At the sight of Lishi's shrewishness, the onlooker suddenly break up a hubbub.Although the onlookers were all gone, things about Feng and Yao also spread out from the mouths of these people, and there was much talk about it everywhere.After Lishi closed the door of the courtyard, she stared at Widow Feng,\u00a0 \"If you don't make the words clear today, I can't spare you.\"Widow Feng patted her pants and climbed up from the ground, not afraid of Lishi.In fact, she had already thought clearly about everything before she came, the Feng family was also clinking with poverty\uff0cnaturally, there was no silver to redeem Feng Heizi who had entered the prison. But the Feng family has no money, the Yao family has it, the Yao family has money, and the Yao family has people who can speak in the county government. There is nothing to panic about.Widow Feng made such a scene today, She has weighed the pros and cons of this matter, although it is shameful, they are the man's position, naturally not afraid. Once things break out, the Yao family can only help her family, unless they want to let the belly-daughter be scolded for a lifetime. As long as the Yao family helped, the son would not only be able to come back, but also the daughter-in-law and grandson would be there, and wouldn\u2019t have to accept the smelly face of the Yao \u2019s old shrew again\uff0call is well with everything.Widow Feng's abacus plays really well\u3002Widow Feng said what she knew. Lishi listened to these and her face turned red and purple for a while. She turned her head and slapped Yan\u2019er,\u00a0 \u00a0\"You stupid girl, you always give me trouble, you give me trouble all the time.\"Yan\u2019er was beaten to tears, but Huiniang stood aside and looked coldly, without dissuasion.\"Anyway, we can only trouble your family when we will be relatives by marriage.You don't need look at other things, but you have to look at the kid in Yan'er belly. \"Widow Feng said with smile.This is the death point of Lishi, and it will die immediately after being pinched.Lishi has never suffered such annoying things, only to stare at Widow Feng, and then chase to fight Yan\u2019er. It's a pity that Widow Feng didn't even give Yan\u2019er a look. After all, she was not her daughter.Lishi angrily roared Hui Niang, \"Su Hui Niang, go and find your man back soon.\" Only by asking Yao Cheng, they can know what's going on at the Yamen.\"Mon, Hong'er is cring. I'll go and see him first.\" Huiniang didn't answer her words, lifting the door curtain into the east cabin, and no longer came out after entering.Lishi was mad and wanted Yan\u2019er to go to find him, but now that her daughter is pregnant, she can only run for herself. But just as she was about to leave, Yaocheng came back, just for Feng Heizi's matter.The Widow Feng only knew that Feng Heizi had committed something because of the silver, but she didn't know the exact details. She knew that her son had been sent to prison to hear what others told her.In fact, Feng Heizi committed a serious matter. He united with a prostitute in Yihong Pavilion and robbed the merchants.First,the prostitute figured out the number and whereabouts of the merchants' silver, and then Feng Heizi took a few accomplices to rob him from halfway.He didn't seem to be doing this kind of thing for the first time, because he was extremely ruthless and never kept alive, so things have never been revealed. But this time,God may have opened his eyes. The merchant he robbed was hit by a stone on his head and thrown into the river, but he didn't die. He climbed up from the river and went to report to the official, which would have involved Feng Heizi out of the way.The official messenger caught him on the spot in the casino, and none of his so-called brothers escaped.It \u2019s heinous crimes to murder for property, The light is exiled three thousand miles, the heavy is beheaded.And this is not the first time Feng Heizi has done this kind of thing. He kept silent, but the prostitute did not resist the severe torture and forced the questioning, and had been clearly explained to the officer. It can be learned from what prostitutes say that Feng Heizi and others have killed no less than three or four lives, not to mention others that have not been learned.In other words, Feng Heizi was dead this time.After hearing Yao Cheng's words, Widow Feng sat on the ground and howled.Now that Widow Feng is completely out of her previous calmness, she naively thinks that her son was hitting someone or stealing something from others. She never thought her son would be so bold. It is not difficult to imagine that after Feng Heizi got the money in the day, if he had n\u2019t eaten it, he would have taken it for gambling and never paid a penny to his family. Widow Feng was busy working outside to make money, and found no clue at all.Not only was the widow Feng, but also Lishi and Yan\u2019er were scared.This time it completely collapsed, what should Yan\u2019er do?The eyes of the Yao family couldn't help but stare at the belly of Yan'er.In the past, when Li and Sister mentioned Yaoyao, they always said that she did not know shame, she was pregnant before marriage, and even Xiaobao was a wild boy without father. Now it is the turn of Yan\u2019er also set foot on the empress of Yaoniang, it is karma in lifetime.The author has something to say,the hero and heroine of this chapter are not yet online, but this chapter has a lot to do with the plot of the hero and heroine in the back. Can you omit it, or don't omit it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 46": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Jin Wang Dotes on His ConcubineCH 35.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayDon\u2019t want Yan'er and the unborn child to no means for substance, can only be Feng Heizi nothing.Yaocheng is a person in Yamen, not only the Widow Feng, but even the Lishi can't help but pin her hopes on him.Yaocheng was so annoyed by the two women. He is not the county magistrate. How could this be possible? But it can't be ignored, and can only be forced to manage.As luck would have it, Jin City was close to the border. Whenever the border troops were tight, they would transfer the local prisoners to join the army. Just above such a paper, Feng Heizi was exempted from the autumn after the execution, was sent to the Border Town.Before leaving, Widow Feng went to see her son off, but Yan'er did not show up at all.Feng Heizi said goodbye to his mother and set foot on the road to the Border Town. A condemned prisoner like this goes to war as cannon fodder. Apparently Feng Heizi also understood the truth of this, so he ran on the way.Yes, he ran.When the news came back, the Yao family and the Feng family did not know whether to laugh or cry.Although Feng Heizi ran away, he also ended up with a family unable to return.He is a registered fugitive and deserter. Once he is arrested, it is an unforgivable crime.Widow Feng sighed with relief, no matter how better than the son lost his life, but the Yao family was in a dilemma.Li and Yaocheng discussed that it was originally intended to let Yan'er to have an abortion. Even if the fetal month is still small, the matter would be settled as soon as possible. But this decision is based on the undoubted death of Feng Heizi. Now that Feng Heizi has fled, will the child stay or not?Finally, Yan'er made a decision not to stay.She would rather die than have the child, and she made a fuss at home.Li found a moving doctor and came back to look after Yan'er. Than, he prescribed a few packs of medicine, saying that it was one pack a day, and even after three days, the fetus would definitely be able to shed. Li paid the money, sent the doctor away, and went to boil the medicine happily for Yan'er.The reason can be this kind of state of mind, because originally if seek the doctor of medical clinic, get at least ten silver ability to solve this problem. She was looking for this moving doctor to solve this problem by using two silver.But Li had forgotten one thing. If it was not necessary, it would be impossible to even ask several clinics for a dozen or so, but this moving doctor was cheaper than several times, because cheap things were not good.The medicine is as effective as the moving doctor said. Yan'er bleeds after eating, but it has been bleeding for five or six days, and still has not seen hemostasis. Li couldn't sit still and sent her daughter to the clinic.When they arrived at the clinic, the doctor scolded Li and said how she found strong drugs to eat. A woman's abortion is a matter of life. If you want to not hurt the root, you have to do it slowly. Because once this strong medicine is not good, it is the end of blood collapse. Yan'er had signs of blood collapse. Before being sent to clinic, she had passed out due to excessive blood loss.The doctor finally rescued Yan'er, but she lost her right to become a mother in the future. The doctor said that the possibility of getting pregnant in her future is very small, this injury is too severe.Li was very distressed and cried for several times, blaming herself for saving money. In fact, she didn\u2019t just save money, the doctors in county clinic only gave medicines when they saw the patients. Li felt ashamed, and afraid of things spreading to have a bad her reputation to her daughter, and found the wandering doctor to buy medicine.How could it be so miserable to be pitted by the moving doctor?And this matter is not over yet, the Widow Feng came to the house, and there were several fights with Li about this thing. Now Feng Heizi is in exile, and still do not know will die in the outside, the baby in the belly of Yan'er is Widow Feng's life.Now the baby's life is gone, Widow Feng is not desperate to fight with Li.It's just that the Widow Feng doesn't make sense. In the end, Yan'er and Feng Heizi have no matchmaker's words and no parents' orders. Even their parents are undecided.She did not wish to keep the child, and it was not unreasonable that she should wish to remarry.But in terms of human feelings, Feng Heizi ended so miserably, but he didn't even have a child. The convention of human nature is to sympathize with the weak, especially now that the heirs are the greatest. Although the Widow Feng was frustrated, the rumors about Yan'er were flying around.Li's idea of marrying Yan'er was completely lost.In Linyun County, few people would marry with Yan'er.*These days Yaocheng was exhausted for his family's affairs, and occasionally could not even take care of the errand.The family was in constant turmoil, and today he went to scold Li and Yan'er before going out, which was considered a cessation.As soon as he entered the Yamen, he was called by the county magistrate.This is the sun hit the west. Although Yaocheng is a monitor of the Yamen, to the county magistrate, He is a worthless little person in fact.Is there any big case in the county?Yaocheng thought that even if there was a big case, he could not get the county magistrate called. He had a superior, a superior in chief, and it was never his turn.He was puzzled to go to the county hall, through the pass into the inside. He saw the county magistrate who had always looked straight at the sky and never aimed at the ground was talking with a man.This man is ordinary in appearance, but he is dressed differently from ordinary people, like a military commander in a certain wealthy and influential family.Yaocheng has some vision, and can only see a little content from the dress that is different from ordinary people, but it is not clear how specific.\"Yaocheng, come here and salute the Guard Wang.\" The county magistrate was strangely affable, and his eyes fixed on Yaocheng. Yaocheng's heart was pounding, and he always had the illusion that he was the long-lost son of the county magistrate.But his father's surname is Yao, and his mother's surname is Li. His mothe said, When he was born, the pain lasted three days and nights and she bit his father's hand.Yaocheng was thinking about messy things, stepped forward to salute the Guard Wang very cautiously.Guard Wang seems a bit snobbish, and just nodded, but he did not speak to Yaocheng.The county magistrate closed to Guard Wang and said, \"Guard Wang, this is Yaocheng. He is smart and capable, and capable, and he is one of the most capable people in our county government. I have always admired him and I was planning to promote him. When you told me that our county government had a monitor\u00a0 surnamed Yao, I knew it was him.\u201dYaocheng has never seen the county magistrate flattering like this. What is the identity of the Guard Wang? Yao is humble, and what he says is not important. He could only listen to them beside him, but was silent.The Guard Wang glanced at the county magistrate and smiled, \"It can be seen that the Master Qian\u00a0 is a wise man, so I will get the thing done. I'm still waiting to go back to the government.\"\"Yes, yes, yes.\" Master Qian nodded again and again, turning his head to look at Yaocheng kindly, \"It is said that your wife's sister entered Wang Mansion to serve as a servant?\"Yaocheng's heart tightened, thinking about what happened to Yaoniang in the Wang Mansion. However, they immediately came to the door, and certainly he was not perfunctory, so he nodded honestly, \"My wife's sister did go to the Jin Wang Mansion a while ago. It was introduced by her sister-in-law. What happened to my wife's sister? Only a while ago, Yaoniang asked someone to bring the letter back from the house... \"Master Qian interrupted him, \"Your wife's sister has nothing to do, but the safety of the Wang Mansion can't be ignored. The background of your wife's sister is to be clear. By the way, is your wife's sister a new widow? and has she an infant son?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I still have to go back to the Wang Mansion to reply the task, I won't stay too long.\u201dMaster Qian followed him all the way to the door and did not turn around until the Guard Wang rode away.No one asked Yaocheng to go, and Yaocheng did not dare to go, so he stood there waiting.When Master Qian came back, he looked at Yaocheng with a kind face, \"I didn't expect you to be blessed. Your wife's sister was actually serving the princess of Jin Wang, Yaocheng... \"Until Yaocheng left the county government hall, he was still a little puzzled.Could it be that Yao Niang is really amazing?He couldn't help thinking of the words of Mama Liu said that day, \u201cthe seventh-ranking official in front of the prime minister\u201d, and always felt that everything was like a dream.The county magistrate, who had always recognized money but not people, looked at him differently. And his wife's sister seemed to get the eye catching of the noble, if not for a Nai Niang also sent special people to check the details.Two delightful things happened in succession, and finally swept the dark clouds of this time. Yaocheng intends to go home and tell Huiniang, and make his wife happy.*Yaoniang did not know about these events in Linyun County.When Zhou Sheng came back, he tell her the words, knowing that her sister was very good and Xiao Bao was very good, and Yaoniang was relieved. She is too busy to deal with Jin Wang now, and she can't think about anything else, and she feels that she can't sleep enough.The day was getting hotter, and the division of lateral courtyard came down this month, there was ice in it.Not only the little princess and Mammy Mu had, even the three Nai Niang also had.This was arranged by Fucheng. It was said that it was hard work for the three Nai Niang to serve the little princess. If they was too hot to sick, The little princess should have no one to serve. Anyway, a little ice is not a big deal. Every winter the Wang Mansion will store a lot of ice for the summer, and the ice storage will not be used up every year, so as to avoid waste.Even so, it was a precedent, and no one said that any Mansion would set ice for the servants. At most, the masters put ice in the house, and the servants followed and rubbed for a while. As for Mammy Mu, she can't be regarded as a servant. This matter is well known in the hearts of the people in Jin Wang Mansion.Then the special treatment of the three Nai Niang, it became the little princess was really loved by Jin Wang, and the servants who were by her side were all blessed. Together with the Liuchun pavilion also a rising tide of the limelight, peremptory a vice of the appearance. After all, lateral courtyard is superficially attached to the Liuchun Pavilion, and the little princess is was born by side consort Hu.Mothers depend on their sons and sons depend on their mothers. These have always been complementary. Although the little princess is not a male, Jin Wang now has only one daughter.Rugui Pavilion, Qixia Pavilion, and Tingxue Pavilion hearded the news, and they were so angry that they gritted their teeth. They wished to push the side consort Hu aside and to give birth to a son or a daughter to Jin Wang, and enjoy the same blessing. On the contrary, Siyi courtyard is very quiet these days, and it seems out of\u00a0 people's sight overnight.Everyone in the house knew that the Wang consort was ill, and when that day Jin Wang left the Siyi courtyard, the Wang consort was ill.This was the first time Jin Wang has never given face to the Wang consort. Although the husband and wife respect each other as a guest, it is rare for Jin Wang to be so disgraced on the Wang consort's birthday.In private, the service personnel have a lot of discussion, saying that according to this trend, the Liuchun Pavilion is even more popular. It is better to have love than reputation in the body, love can make the children.However, side consort Hu had only been in the house for more than one year, and she gave birth to a little princess. The Wang consort had been married to Jin Wang for seven or eight years, but she had not been able to give birth to a heir.Although not willing to admit, it have to say that the dispute on imperial\u00a0 always depends on the heir.The heirs are related to the future of Jin Wang Mansion. If the Wang consort can\u2019t give birth to a son and let others take the lead, then Jin Wang Mansion\u2019s subordinates will have nothing to do with the Wang consort in the future.At most, she was empty to bear the name of Tai Wang consort. According to the Wang consort and the side consort Hu fight in this way, she didn't know if she could have a good ending in the future. It's not that such a thing hasn't happened yet. A Wang Mansion was succeeded to the son from the side consort, the old Wang consort was forced to stay out of the house by the old side consort, and she dared not even show her face.Maybe there is a distinction of rank, and a distinction of birth outside, but it is in the royal family that there is the least distinction of birth.In Siyi courtyard, the Wang consort lying withered on the bed, zhou Mama is not there, only Ziyan stay at her side to serve.Jin Wang consort laughed sarcastically, and said to Ziyan, \"Look, this is coming.\"Ziyan sighed, \"Wang consort... \"\"This is how he forced me! Why do you force me? I have stepped back, I have stepped back countless steps, why did you force me? My father forced me, and my mother also forced me. He was a breeze appearance, but\u00a0 actually forcing me. He got a woman like that to come back and disgust me, and show it to me. I had to fight with her in order not to put people on my head ... Haha, what he wanted to see was finally seen, he was really cruel ... \"The author has something to say.Jin Wang: I was just drilling into the little Nai Niang's room at night, and can't stand the heat, so finds myself cool. You can really make up for them \u2192.\u2192Yaoniang: I don't know anything.A lot of readers said that Jin Wang sent people to check it out, and he could find out that Xiao Bao was his son. This idea was taken for granted. First of all, Yaoniang's background is clear. It was impossible for Wang consort to get a woman of unknown origin into the Mansion. What happened, she couldn't run away the first. Jin Wang is a prince, a prince, and guarding the side of the country. If the loss of his life is due to the reason of Jin Wang consort, she will definitely die, and the Xu Guogong Mansion can't run away. Didn't find that the Nai Niang that Jin Wang consort was looking for were all of her Service personnel relatives\u2019 relatives?And it \u2019s easy to check the origin of Yaoniang. It\u2019s natural to ask Liu Mama firstly. who will not introduce female dependents, so it \u2019s Yaocheng who bears the brunt. Yaocheng is the officials and the easiest to find. In the ancient times, officials like police were passed down from generation to generation. There is no doubt about the origin. His social network is innocent. Since he said so, there can be no problem with the origin of Yaoniang. Moreover, Yaoniang\u2019s social network is also innocent. She has a household registration and is a local citizen.Don\u2019t worry about when Jin Wang\u00a0 finds Xiao Bao. I don\u2019t think everyone wants to see the male host because the female host gave him a son, the female host will give birth to a son, only the female host gives him a son, and likes the female host of. In fact, I also like to read the buns, but some buns are written to give people the impression that the role of the heroine is that belly. Although judging from the current situation of Yaoniang, she can't do anything terribly important, and it's her life in a lifetime, but I really don't want her to be just a belly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Only with the support of Ziyan did she finally stop her laughter. \u201cWhen she first entered the mansion, had I used my identity and capabilities, she wouldn\u2019t even be able to last a day. Ziyan, let me tell you the truth. When you enter a mansion, know that if the west wind doesn\u2019t overwhelm the east mind, it would be the east wind that overwhelms the west wind. Even if you aren\u2019t interested in fighting, there would still be countless people forcing you to fight. If you refuse to fight, you can only wait for your death\u2026\u201dZiyan thought about the reports she\u2019d received in the past few days. According to the reports, Side Consort Hu\u2019s people were extremely arrogant, often confronting their own people and even gathering other servants around. She remained silent.In her short-sightedness, she had always believed that since the consort doesn\u2019t like disputes, why not just stay as far away as possible? After all, as the main consort, just a meager Side Consort Hu wouldn\u2019t be enough to shake her position. However, just slightly over a year had gone by, when reality slapped her fiercely in the face.Even if Side Consort Hu was a cheap whore and born as a prostitute, with Jin Wang backing her, she could still ride roughshod over the noble Consort Jin.\u201cBack then, my mother also suffered from this kind of loss. She thought she was so noble and no one could shake her position. Yet, she still ended up angered for most of her life as she watched that person give birth to both a son and a daughter. Meanwhile, throughout the decades she had only managed to give birth to a daughter. However, I\u2019m not even as good as my mother. Without any child to rely on, who knows how that person will deal with me in the future\u2026\u201dZi Yan had wanted to say some comforting words to Consort Jin when she sat up suddenly from the couch herself and said, \u201cNo, I can\u2019t sit and wait around for death. Since he is disgusted with me, I will find someone that won\u2019t make him disgusted. After their child is born, I will have the baby brought to my side to raise. The woman can be anyone, but it can\u2019t be the one from Liuchun Pavilion.\u201d\u201cYour highness, then we\u2014\u201d\u201cLet the people in Xiaokua\u2019s courtyard make some movements, and see if you can instigate that stupid and unenlightened wet nurse, who doesn\u2019t even understand that the pavilion closest to the water enjoys moonlight first. Go call over Concubine Feng and let some servants also go out to search for more candidates. This consort doesn\u2019t believe that no one can\u2019t steal that bitch\u2019s limelight.\u201dAs these words fell, Consort Jin\u2019s eyes flashed brightly. It wasn\u2019t until that moment did the former prestige of the proud daughter of Xu Jiatian reappear. Time may have consumed her arrogance, but it hadn\u2019t consumed her mind.\u201cYes, your highness.\u201d~Yaoniang didn\u2019t know that because a certain man always sneaked into her room at night, and couldn\u2019t tolerate the heat, to make himself and her more comfortable, he ordered for the ice to be brought to all three of the nannies. If Yaoniang learned of the truth, she would probably be frightened to death.A message had been sent down, and the ice kettles were delivered in the afternoon.Except for the little princess and Mammy Mu, each of the three nurses had an ice kettle in their room. Nanny Qian and Nanny Wang were so happy that they laughed until their eyes couldn\u2019t be seen. The other servants all admired their good fortune, only Yao Niang remained low-key.When the ice kettles were delivered, a lot of onlookers joined in the fun.As the young servant girls looked around here and there, some discerning ones noticed that the ice kettle in Yaoniang\u2019s room was different from the rest.Originally, everyone was very happy, but once these words were said aloud, their enthusiasm dampened.Nanny Qian is used to being a petty person. Hearing this, she felt uncomfortable, so she made up an excuse and went to Yao Niang\u2019s room to take a look.Yaoniang was rearranging her room since the ice kettle was not small. She had specially cleared out some space before finally settling the kettle down. Then she fetched a basin of water and carefully wiped off the dust on it. The kettle appeared to have been just taken out of the storage room.The arrival of Nanny Qian made Yaoniang a little surprised. After all, shouldn\u2019t she be busy in her own room right now?When Nanny Qian came in, her eyes were glued to the ice kettle. She gazed up and down all over the kettle before she snorted and walked out.As soon as Nanny Qian left, Ah Xia came in.After a glance at Nanny Qian\u2019s back, she turned and said to Yaoniang anxiously, \u201cNanny Su, I heard some of the others say that the kettles are different.\u201d\u201cHow are they different?\u201d asked Yaoniang.Ah Xia glanced around Yaoniang\u2019s room and her eyes fell on the ice kettle.In a daze, she pointed towards the ice kettle and said, \u201cThis is different.\u201dYaoniang turned her head and her gaze rested on her ice kettle as she wondered how hers was different from the others. Only after Ah Xia started explaining did she understand how her kettle was special.The colours of the kettles were different and even though all three of the kettles were made of copper, the kettle in Nanny Qian\u2019s room was made of bronze while Yaoniang\u2019s was made of brass. The details and patterns on the kettles were different too.(TN: Bronze and brass are both copper alloys. Bronze is a mixture of copper and tin while brass is a mixture of copper and zinc.)Under the current circumstances, Yaoniang couldn\u2019t go herself so she could only send Ah Xia to take a look at Nanny Wang\u2019s ice kettle.When Ah Xia returned, she reported that Nanny Wang\u2019s and Nanny Qian\u2019s kettles were identical. Yaoniang was speechless.Isn\u2019t this simply asking for trouble?The few servants who had delivered the ice kettles were on their way to leave when they were stopped by Nanny Qian and Nanny Wang in the courtyard.\u201cDid you guys deliver the wrong things?\u201dThe leader of the servants looked at the nannies with doubt and asked, \u201cWhat do you mean we delivered the wrong things?\u201d\u201cThe kettles! They\u2019re different!\u201d Nanny Qian was at a loss as to how to explain further. She could only gesture wildly in the direction of Yaoniang\u2019s room.The servants still couldn\u2019t understand her.Nanny Wang smiled, pulled Nanny Qian aside, and said, \u201cDon\u2019t misunderstand us. She doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019s talking about. It\u2019s just that one of the kettles that were delivered is different from the other two.\u201dA servant frowned and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference? We were ordered to send it. Even if there was a difference, the arrangements were made by those above and there\u2019s nothing we can do about it.\u201dAfter listening to the explanation, Nanny Qian still had more words to say but was violently grabbed by Nanny Wang from behind.\u201cTake care,\u201d said Nanny Wang with a smile.After the servants were gone, Nanny Wang glared at Nanny Qian angrily and said, \u201cI already said that there was no need to ask, but you just had to go look for more trouble.\u201dOnce she finished her words, Nanny Wang walked away and left Nanny Qian standing there all alone. Nanny Qian stomped her foot fiercely while her eyes shot daggers at Yaoniang\u2019s room. Then she quickly hurried back to her own room.No one discovered Mammy Mu standing there in the eastern corridor with Yuyan by her side.\u201cAct as if you didn\u2019t hear anything,\u201d said Mammy Mu.Yuyan nodded her head.~Yaoniang went to the small kitchen to eat dinner.When Nanny Qian and Nanny Wang who were already there saw her walk in, neither of them greeted her like before. Nanny Qian, especially, had \u2018unwillingness\u2019 written all over her face.However, the other people in the small kitchen still treated Yaoniang as warmly as before, if not warmer.Even though the three wet nurses competed with each other, the others were sensible enough to understand how to act accordingly.Perhaps the favouritism was too much that it caused Nanny Qian and Nanny Wang to lose their composure. Normally, they would still try to maintain some superficial affection.Old Lady Wang attentively handed Yao Niang\u2019s dinner to her. This time, unlike before, it was especially packed in a food box.Food was normally served on a tray, but now that it was placed in a container, people may think that there was something special hidden inside. Nanny Qian showed a stiff smile but her eyes burned with anger. Although Nanny Wang\u2019s displeasure wasn\u2019t as obvious, her face didn\u2019t look pretty either.Yao Niang hurriedly took her food box and left. Nanny Wang and Nanny Qian remained in the small kitchen, what they would say and do, she wasn\u2019t interested in knowing. She also didn\u2019t bother to care and she didn\u2019t even have the time to care, because she guessed that Jin Wang would be coming again at night.Just as she expected, he came in the middle of the night.Recently, Jin Wang always arrived punctually and seldom skipped a single night. It\u2019s probably because after having a brief taste of pleasure, he became more greedy.However, there was one thing that had always confused Yaoniang. Jin Wang never entered her, but always climaxed outside of her.There was nothing wrong with Jin Wang\u2019s body. She had personally experienced it all in her previous life and also a little in this lifetime. However, now her thighs were rubbed completely red and raw, but he still wouldn\u2019t enter her.Does he think that she was dirty?Obviously, she shouldn\u2019t be thinking in this direction, but she couldn\u2019t help it. There were no other explanations that she could think of.However, Yaoniang didn\u2019t dare to mention even a word of this matter. Although her heart was knotted inside, she still left the matter alone to avoid unnecessary trouble. She also had an inferiority complex. If Jin Wang really did disdain her and she\u2019d blurted out her thoughts wouldn\u2019t it be just asking for humiliation?With these thoughts floating in her mind, Yaoniang inevitably became less enthusiastic as she served Jin Wang.Jin Wang was puzzled as to why she suddenly became less enthusiastic. Perhaps he wasn\u2019t as vigorous as her former husband? With this thought in mind, he began to toss her around even more fiercely.But after tossing around for a long time, Jin Wang also realized that there was something not quite right. Yet, if someone had asked him, he wouldn\u2019t be able to say what exactly wasn\u2019t right. The feeling was as if there was an itch that he couldn\u2019t scratch.All of Jin Wang\u2019s knowledge regarding the love between men and women in bed was from listening to the crude jokes made by the rough men from the barracks.He knew that women had another entrance that would cause unimaginable bliss for men. He had personally experienced it before and it had left a lasting impression. As for the other stuff he had heard from the soldiers, he had only understood the words but not the meaning.Truth to be told, as a prince, he shouldn\u2019t be so ignorant. The first time he had a wet dream, the palace should have sent an experienced maid to teach him. However, that year an incident occurred and a shadow for the female body appeared in Jin Wang\u2019s heart. Later, he married Consort Jin and encountered another incident that further deepened his psychological scar.Nowadays, he would vomit at the mere sight of a female\u2019s body.Even though he had a princess with Side Consort Hu, that was just an accident. In fact, they had only slept together that one time.In regards to this matter, he was completely innocent.However, the truth must not be made known to outsiders. How could Jin Wang possibly let the public learn about his private affairs?It\u2019s just that Yaoniang\u2019s shy look and considerate acts all moved Jin Wang, especially his self-esteem as a man.As he recollected the words he heard from the soldiers, he compared them with what he had experienced. But there was one phrase, \u201cTo enter and be willing to die inside,\u201d that he still couldn\u2019t understand.Enter where? And why would someone be willing to die?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 49": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Jin Wang Dotes on His ConcubineCH 36.2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe next day, in his pursuit, to better understand the love between men and women, Jin Wang specially asked for a pornographic book.Although this type of book was most commonly found in the palace, Jin Wang hadn\u2019t even read a single one before. Once, he had accidentally taken a brief look at a page, and he became so disgusted that he wanted to vomit.However, now holding a mentality of cutting off all retreats, he asked for his servants to look for a copy so he could learn.This time as he looked inside, his previous disgust was forgotten. Instead, it was as if he had discovered a whole new world.Although he still hadn\u2019t figured out what the phrase, \u201cTo enter and be willing to die inside,\u201d meant, he did get a grasp of some fancy new positions. Later that evening, when he tried them with Yaoniang, he felt like his soul was about to fly out.Although Jin Wang still didn\u2019t know how to enter Yaoniang, he kept poking and jabbing at a certain place that he almost succeeded.Yaoniang\u2019s body was sensitive and soon she felt as if she\u2019d died several times already from one round. Jin Wang also finally understood the soldiers\u2019 feelings. It was like seeing the world through new lenses.After that evening, Jin Wang became even more interested in pornographic books. He commanded his servants to go gather some more. With a fawning attitude, the servants all brought Jin Wang some of the most popular pornographic books available on the market.Adopting a serious and studious attitude, Jin Wang carefully poured over all the material. Then, he finally realized the problem.~The light in the room was dim. A copper ice kettle stood in the corner of the room and it was filled to the brim with ice. A refreshing coolness spread through the room.After Jin Wang had come in and laid down on the bed, Yaoniang began to serve him some refreshments.Jin Wang reclined on the bed with his long legs slightly bent. He was wearing only a pair of purple pants and a shirt half opened as he fixed his gaze on Yaoniang, who was reluctant to join him on the bed.Yaoniang had already drunk a stomach full of water, but she still held her cup and continued to take small sips. Recently, she had become more and more fearful of Jin Wang, and she was too scared to face himJin Wang coughed lightly, but the sound seemed especially loud in the originally quiet room.Yaoniang\u2019s hands shook and her heart raced like a deer. She knew that if she continued to dawdle, he would only become annoyed. She reluctantly placed her cup down and ambled towards him. As soon as she had walked over, she was dragged onto the bed.Yaoniang let out a brief shriek and hurriedly covered her mouth. She wasn\u2019t the only one living in the west wing. There was an empty room where Cuizhu used to live between the other nannies\u2019 room and her room. Despite the buffer, Yaoniang was still scared of being discovered.Jin Wang lowered his head and tried to rip Yaoniang\u2019s top off. She started to struggle and pushed against his chest. \u201cNo! Wait! Wait!\u201dYaoniang continued to struggle so Jin Wang stopped and looked at her, confused.Her face turned red as a tomato. When she couldn\u2019t bear to look at him any longer, she covered her face with her hands. Then she whispered, \u201cLately, there hasn\u2019t been enough milk for the little princess\u2026\u201dThese words were simple and Jin Wang wasn\u2019t dumb.Was she accusing him of stealing his daughter\u2019s food?Even though Jin Wang was shameless, this time he couldn\u2019t help but feel a little embarrassed. To conceal his awkwardness, he coughed lightly and moved away.Jin Wang sat up and placed one of his hands behind Yaoniang\u2019s neck as support, while his other hand groped underneath. As he continued to grope, his hand began to creep under her skirts. Yaoniang furrowed her brows slightly but she didn\u2019t stop him. Yet, when his hand prodded at that unspeakable place, Yaoniang couldn\u2019t hold back anymore. She hurriedly pressed down on his hand.Jin Wang raised his eyebrows and his eyes were gloomy. However, because of his guilty conscience from earlier, he still took his hand away.He had fumbled around clumsily and pressed on a sensitive spot, but Yaoniang still regretted what she\u2019d done.\u201cYour highness\u2026\u201dJin Wang lowered his head and tried to peek underneath.Noticing something in the way, he tried to pull down Yaoniang\u2019s underwear. Unwilling to let it be pulled away, she grabbed onto it.Under the dim yellow light, Yaoniang\u2019s skin appeared especially fair and glossy. Her indigo-coloured underwear hung pitifully on her hips but was soon ripped out of the way.The beautiful scenery was revealed; her lower abdomen was smooth with no blemishes. There was some dark, slightly curled, soft, but sparse grass that laid on her pubic region, concealing the beginning of a quiet pathway.There also seemed to be a few drops of clear dew laying on the fragrant grass. They appeared to have landed there when Jin Wang withdrew his fingers.Around Yaoniang\u2019s jade neck hung a thin string that connected down to a dudou. The dudou barely managed to cover her firm and plump towers.Jin Wang had tasted the two jade white rabbits countless times, yet he still hadn\u2019t gotten tired of it.Now he wanted to taste what was hiding underneath, so he grabbed tightly onto Yaoniang\u2019s slender legs. She tried to keep her legs together and refused to let him spread them, but how could she be Jin Wang\u2019s opponent?Jin Wang applied some pressure and the next thing she knew, her legs were numb and spread apart.Yaoniang was embarrassed to death. She could only pull up the blankets and cover her face, in an attempt to bury her head in the sand.Now that she couldn\u2019t see, her sense of touch intensified. When she felt something poking her from underneath, Yaoniang shifted a little, and her heart felt stifled.Hiding was no longer an option.With a sense of melancholy, Yaoniang\u2019s suspended heart finally settled down. She accepted that hiding from her fate was impossible.Truth be told, after a brief analysis, Yaoniang realized that she wasn\u2019t feeling opposed to any of this. She had already expected this day to come.It was also because she missed him. She missed him so much.~Waves rose and fell, seemingly endless.Yaoniang grabbed tightly onto the mattress and bit down on her lips to prevent her moans from escaping. She felt her lips were already bitten blue, but Jin Wan still hadn\u2019t moved onto the main course.Jin Wang stared at the stunning scenery in front of him with bloodshot eyes. White and flawless skin wherever he looked. Then he peered down and saw a tender, juicy, red slit that gushed out a clear liquid.He held himself and tried several times, but still couldn\u2019t get in.With difficulty, he finally found the right angle and gradually pushed himself in.Jin Wang let out a gasp as she groaned in pain.Yaoniang tensed her body and wanted to push him away, but was instead pressed down firmly by him.With her earlobe in his mouth, Jin Wang quickly gasped, \u201cLoosen up a little.\u201d\u201cIt hurts\u2026\u201d Yaoniang whimpered softly like a wounded animal.Veins bulged on Jin Wang\u2019s forehead and his whole body was tense. He wanted to push himself in, but he was afraid that she wouldn\u2019t be able to bear it. Only then did he realize that their sizes weren\u2019t compatible.Or did he get the wrong opening?As he thought of this, Yaoniang loosened up. She also understood that there was no way to back down. Compared with Jin Wang, she was the one who was obviously more experienced.She tried to calm herself down. She slowly relaxed her body, and whispered in his ear, \u201cMove around a little, but you must move gently. Don\u2019t come in all at once. Push in little by little\u2026\u201dOnce Jin Wang heard this, he allowed himself to move a bit. At first, he didn\u2019t quite understand what she meant, but gradually he got the rhythm right. He learned that the more he moved, the better he felt, and the more he hammered, the more comfortable it was.Not only was Jin Wang comfortable, Yaoniang felt amazing too. A tingling sensation gradually began to build up inside.Yaoniang\u2019s temperature rose and she could feel more moisture seeping out underneath. With the extra lubricant, the giant iron rod sank in deeper.Jin Wang gradually got the hang of it and his movements became bigger and bigger.Yaoniang felt like her body had turned into a pool of water. All she wanted to do was grab onto him even more tightly. She wanted more. Jin Wang\u2019s current movements could no longer satisfy her. It only served to make her feel unbearable inside.Her cheeks were flushed, her watery eyes blinked, and she could feel her breasts begin to swell. She couldn\u2019t hold back anymore so she arched her chest up towards him.Taking advantage of the situation, Jin Wang took a hold of one of her breasts and kneaded it. With his thick and calloused fingers, he rubbed her tender nipples.Some fluid was squeezed out and Jin Wang scooped it up. At the same time, he lowered his waist and rammed up to the hilt.Yao Niang shuddered. She wanted to clamp her slender milky white legs around him, but she was too embarrassed to do it.She trembled even harder, then her body collapsed like a broken string.That place of Yaoniang was very tight and very small. Her tender insides clamped down tightly on Jin Wang\u2019s iron rod. There seemed to be countless tiny mouths, all sucking on his tool at the same time.Jin Wang finally understood the words from the men in the army. Every woman had a small opening that could take a man to the seventh heaven.Now, he was even willing to give Yaoniang his entire soul.He continued to slam into her just as he did before. Pulling out, pushing in, pulling out, pushing in.As he heard Yaoniang\u2019s soft whimpers, Jin Wang desperately wished to fuck her even harder.Yes, fuck.He recalled his memory from the military camp. The soldiers had drunk hard liquor and then they spoke with their rough accents. \u201c\u2026Hearing her coquettish cries, I want to fuck her to tears\u2026\u201dJin Wang also wanted to fuck the petite wet nurse to tears.And he did fuck her to tears. She cried pitifully. Not daring to make any noise, she could only bite onto the corner of the blanket. Her face was red and streams of tears flowed from her eyes.Even though Jin Wang felt some distress as he watched her, he still pulled the bothersome blankets aside. Then he held up her tender opening and hammered his waist even harder.Time unknowingly flew by.Yaoniang didn\u2019t know anything anymore. Her entire body was heavy and she felt like a fish out of water. She had already climaxed several times but Jin Wang still kept going.She couldn\u2019t help but beg, \u201cYour highness, have mercy on me\u2026\u201dJin Wang really did fuck her to tears. He had fucked her to the point of weeping and begging.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

On the bed laid a pair of people, sleeping peacefully.Jin Wang woke up, but he remained still and didn\u2019t move.In his arms laid a petite woman, fast asleep. Her back leaned against his chest and her body curled inwards. One of his arms laid under her thin neck as a pillow, while his other arm wrapped around her slim waist, under the blankets.Jin Wang had never experienced such an intimate position before so naturally, he was unwilling to let go.Her hair emitted a sweet fragrance and her slender hands were so soft it was as if they were boneless. As if addicted, his palm couldn\u2019t help but wander around continuously.Jin Wang\u2019s hand crept up her body until it could reach no further so he could only stop.The person lying in his embrace shifted a little and Jin Wang greedily kissed her delicate neck.As Yaoniang laid there half awake, she felt the clothes that she\u2019d changed into that morning be yanked away. Before she could even react, she felt him enter her from behind.She inhaled sharply, but Jin Wang ignored her.The bed began to shake again in a melodious rhythm.It was only under Yaoniang\u2019s continuous urging did Jin Wang finally stop.The sky was already bright outside, but the bed was still a mess. Yaoniang couldn\u2019t help but want to cry again.Yaoniang asked anxiously, \u201cNow what should we do?\u201dJin Wang slowly put his clothes back on and said, \u201cIt\u2019s no big deal.\u201dYaoniang looked at the culprit and she thought about how he had tossed her around nonstop last night. She couldn\u2019t help but lose her temper. \u201cIt\u2019s all your fault! Look at what time it is already! Everyone in the courtyard has already woken up and\u2026\u201d She paused before she added, \u201cI also don\u2019t have any more clean bedding.\u201dThinking up to this point, Yaoniang felt sorry for herself. During the day, she had to wait on the daughter and during the night, she must serve the father.Recently, everyone looked surprised to see her wash her bedding in the morning. When they asked her for the reason, she could only blush and remain silent.She knew that it wasn\u2019t possible to always be on her period. Plus, she wasn\u2019t even on her period right now. Her excuse could only be that she sweats too much and that she couldn\u2019t stand the sweat stains on her bedding.It was fine if she said that once or twice. But, she needed to repeatedly wash her bedding, so Yaoniang was at a loss for what to do. Because of this, Yaoniang turned timider and it was rare for her to reveal her claws to Jin Wang.She worried about the current situation too. Yaoniang thought hard about how Jin Wang could leave her room without alerting anyone.Jin Wang watched her face flush with urgency, but inexplicably, he wasn\u2019t angry nor could he bear to rebuke her. Instead, she only made others feel distressed for her.He recalled her being bullied by him last night and her pitiful cries, then he looked towards the messy bed. Jin Wang felt slightly embarrassed.He coughed lightly and held out his hand.At that moment, Yaoniang also realized her brashness. As she fretted inside, she saw him reach out his hand so she hurriedly walked over and sat down in his lap.\u201cSince this prince said that it\u2019s nothing, then it\u2019s nothing.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201dJin Wang changed the subject. \u201cIsn\u2019t it almost time for you to go to work?\u201dAt that moment, someone knocked on the door. \u201cNanny Su, are you up yet?\u201dIt was Ah Xia who hadn\u2019t seen Yaoniang so she came to her room to call her.Yaoniang subconsciously jumped up from Jin Wang\u2019s lap and replied, \u201cI\u2019ll be there right away!\u201d After that, she turned to Jin Wang and anxiously asked, \u201cWhat are you going to do? How are you going to leave? There are people outside.\u201d\u201cWorry about yourself. This prince knows what to do.\u201dYaoniang looked at him suspiciously. \u201cReally? Make sure to not let anyone see you.\u201dJin Wang stared at her gloomily. Yaoniang didn\u2019t dare to say anything else so she left in a hurry.In the eastern chamber, Yuyan said, \u201cMammy Mu, Nanny Su is up.\u201dMammy Mu nodded and said, \u201cGo clear away the outsiders then invite his highness to come over.\u201dYuyan accepted the commands and left. Some people were sent away while other people were given orders to preoccupy themselves. Soon the entire front yard was unoccupied. Then she came to Yaoniang\u2019s door, knocked, and said, \u201cYour highness, Mammy Mu invites you over.\u201dAfter speaking, she walked off in a hurry and didn\u2019t dare to remain any longer to avoid embarrassing Jin Wang.As soon as she left, Jin Wang came out of Yaoniang\u2019s room and headed towards the eastern chambers.In the eastern chambers, Mammy Mu was sitting on her bed while Jin Wang sat opposite her.Yuyan brought over some tea, then she quickly left.\u201cWhat does your highness plan to do?\u201dJin Wang was slightly embarrassed. That person just had to be his daughter\u2019s nanny. As he sneaked into her room every night, he thought no one was aware, but it was still the old ginger that was the spiciest.\u201cHow did Mammy know?\u201dMammy Mu smiled and said, \u201cThat person is simpleminded and everything is written on her face. She gets up every day and washes her bedding before dawn. It\u2019s not hard for anyone observant to notice.\u201dJin Wang covered his mouth with a fist and coughed lightly. He finally understood why the usually timid wet nurse had reacted so harshly and even dared to expose her claws to him. It turned out that her resentment came from here.He couldn\u2019t help but imagine a petite wet nurse secretly carrying a basin of dirty sheets out to wash, and felt that he was too cruel.\u201cWhat does your highness intend to do?\u201d Mammy Mu asked her last question again since Jin Wang still hadn\u2019t answered her.Jin Wang frowned and said, \u201cThis prince wanted to give her a title, but she didn\u2019t want it.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She could be regarded as an elder that he respects.Mammy Mu contemplated.Mammy Mu was a veteran from the palace. Even if Jin Wang didn\u2019t explain anything further in detail, she could still more or less understand what he meant.There were thousands of women on this earth. Some women were willing to do anything to climb up for power. Some women were willing to fight over trivial matters as if in a dogfight. There were countless desperate women in this world. But there were also those who honestly did their duty with a kind heart and without any evil intentions.According to Mammy Mu\u2019s observation during the past few weeks, Su Yaoniang was the latter.Although she had a gorgeous appearance, she abided by her duties and did not take any shortcuts. Her actions only made people want to laugh at her or scold her for her foolish stubbornness.Yet, is this type of person really stupid?Of course not.At least Mammy Mu believed Yaoniang was wise. There was a saying that went like this: a wife wasn\u2019t as good as a concubine, a concubine wasn\u2019t as good as a mistress, and a mistress wasn\u2019t as good as someone unobtainable. Many men were like this. They weren\u2019t interested in what they already have, but in those out of their reach.Of course, it may not be Yaoniang deliberately leaving Jin Wang hanging. But her behaviour was enough to whet Jin Wang\u2019s appetite.One had to know that Jin Wang was a highly suspicious person, yet Su Yaoniang was someone that Consort Jin had successfully stuffed in.\u201cI doubt she understands Siyi Courtyard\u2019s intentions. There\u2019s this girl from that courtyard who\u2019s always looking for her to talk. Yet whenever possible, Yaoniang would avoid her. If she could hide, she would hide.\u201d Mammy Mu smiled and asked, \u201cHas your highness checked on her background?\u201dJin Wang nodded. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t dare to stuff in any random person. After all these years, doesn\u2019t Mammy already know her way of doing things? Fucheng also dispatched someone to go check on Yaoniang\u2019s background. She is a native of Jinzhou, born and raised here. Her brother-in-law is a bailiff of the county and her father is a poor scholar, her family background is clean.\u201dThe \u2018she\u2019 that Jin Wang had mentioned was naturally referring to Consort Jin. Speaking of Consort Jin, Mammy Mu couldn\u2019t help but sigh. \u201cNo matter how dissatisfied you are with her, she is still your main consort. You have to leave her some face. According to Yuyan, she had angered you a while ago and you haven\u2019t set foot in Siyi Courtyard ever since. Those in the other courtyard have been very arrogant recently. Your highness, don\u2019t think of this old slave as too long-winded, but a wife is a wife and a concubine is a concubine. If the hierarchy is messed up, it would bring about all sorts of unnecessary things.Jin Wang remained silent for a while. He fidgeted with the sapphire ring on his index finger before he said, \u201cThis prince knows.\u201d\u201cEven though she\u2019s a little arrogant, there\u2019s nothing else wrong with her.\u201dJin Wang made no comments. He didn\u2019t want to reveal too much to Mammy Mu because there were many things that she didn\u2019t know. Jin Wang preferred for it to remain that way.Seeing him like this, Mammy Mu also didn\u2019t say anything else. Today was the first time that she had said so much. It was only because she feared Jin Wang didn\u2019t understand how to keep the rear courtyard balanced. If the rear courtyard was unbalanced, troubles would arise.Jin Wang stood up and said, \u201cMammy, this prince has other duties to attend to.\u201dMammy Mu wanted to send him off but was stopped by him.\u201cShe is a simple-minded woman. If anything happens, trouble Mammy to look after her.\u201d Jin Wang paused before he said, \u201cI\u2019ll have Fucheng send over a servant girl. Arrange for her to stay in the room beside her so they can take care of each other.Mammy Mu nodded her head and Jin Wang left.Fearing that there wasn\u2019t enough time, Yaoniang didn\u2019t bring her breakfast back to her room to eat. Instead, she found a place to stand like the others.A girl dressed in pink walked over to her with a smile and said, \u201cNanny Su! You\u2019re here!\u201dWhen she saw this girl, Yaoniang couldn\u2019t help but frown.She had recognized her immediately. She was her so-called close servant from her previous life, Die\u2019er.Yaoniang disliked people like Die\u2019er. She was a vain person who loved to nitpick but also had loose lips and a lazy attitude. In her previous life, Yaoniang always had to clean up her messes after her. Worst of all, there was nothing that she could do about it. She could only tolerate her because she was someone that Consort Jin had sent to serve her.Despite everything, Die\u2019er wasn\u2019t without any merits. She knew a lot about the mansion, at least more than Yaoniang, and could come up with some decent advice. This was another reason why Yaoniang tolerated her.However, Yaoniang had no plans to get close to her in this lifetime. After her rebirth, she understood a lot more. Yaoniang\u2019s perception of Die\u2019er had changed a lot. She understood that both Die\u2019er\u2019s merits and faults had purposeful intentions. Consort Jin had deliberately planted Die\u2019er to incite conflict between herself and Side Consort Hu.In her previous life, if it hadn\u2019t been for Die\u2019er\u2019s instigation, she wouldn\u2019t even have the courage to target Side Consort Hu. Die\u2019er always had disputes with the people in the Spring Pavilion over trivial matters. Eventually, the conflicts between the two courtyards escalated. True, Side Consort Hu and herself were already foes. Yet, if it hadn\u2019t been for Die\u2019er, they wouldn\u2019t have reached the point of not letting the other live.People always reflected on their past wrongdoings. Yaoniang had learned to be more careful after experiencing death, which was most likely caused by Side Consort Hu. Ever since she started working at her current courtyard, Die\u2019er frequently approached her. However, Yaoniang would always choose to avoid her if she could.Holding her breakfast, Die\u2019er walked up to Yaoniang\u2019s side.\u201cNanny Su, do you want any more steamed buns? I probably won\u2019t be able to finish both.\u201d She lifted the bowl in her hand to show that it contained two fat and white steamed buns.Yaoniang finished up her porridge quickly and cleared away her utensils. \u201cEnjoy your breakfast. I need to go report for duty.\u201dAfter she finished her sentence, Yaoniang hurried away. As Die\u2019er watched her leave, she couldn\u2019t help but frown.She could feel Yaoniang\u2019s aversion towards herself but she couldn\u2019t understand why. Die\u2019er believed that she wasn\u2019t an annoying person.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Yet, when she opened the door, there was no one inside. Her gaze landed on her tidied bed, free of the messy wrinkles from last night, and on the clean bedding that had replaced the soiled bedsheets.Yaoniang finally let out a sigh of relief, yet she couldn\u2019t help but wonder who did it. It definitely wasn\u2019t Jin Wang so it must have been one of his subordinates. But who could it be? It was done so quickly that it was the same amount of time she\u2019d finished her breakfast in.With doubts running through her mind, Yaoniang began her first errands of the day.Yaoniang\u2019s body wasn\u2019t without any pain. In fact, it was sore and uncomfortable everywhere. However, she didn\u2019t find the pain to be completely unbearable, so she just gritted her teeth and endured it.The little princess was already five months old. That was an age where babies would become extremely lively. The princess would want to play with everything in sight and she napped much less than before too. She used to spend more time asleep instead of awake. Now, she needs someone to accompany her to play and she would take short naps only in the morning and afternoon.After she had finally put the little princess to sleep, Yaoniang also felt very tired. Her waist was also so sore that she almost couldn\u2019t straighten it.Yuyan noticed it and said, \u201cNanny Su, you don\u2019t look so well. Why don\u2019t you go back to your room and rest for a bit?\u201dYaoniang dazedly said, \u201cFor some reason, my pillow fell last night while I was sleeping. Now my neck hurts.\u201d Actually, it was the entire body that was aching, not just the neck. There was also pain in the back and the legs.Yuyan nodded sympathetically. \u201cStiff necks could be really painful. Why don\u2019t you go back to your room and rest for today? I\u2019ll have Nanny Qian and the others substitute for you.\u201dYaoniang thought about it for a while. Then she said, \u201cNo need. It\u2019s not a big deal.\u201dShe was already harsh on the eyes for Nanny Wang and Nanny Qian. If she returned to her room to rest and let them work instead, wouldn\u2019t it be asking for more hate?\u201cIf you don\u2019t feel well, just go and rest. Ever since you started taking care of the little princess, you haven\u2019t taken a break. Return to your room and relax. There\u2019s also no need to come report for tomorrow. Take these two days off.\u201d Yuyan paused. Then she said, \u201cIt\u2019s your turn to rest. There\u2019s no need to feel guilty for it.\u201dSince Yuyan insisted, Yaoniang could only obey.In fact, she also wanted to take a breather. She had been feeling really worn out recently.Now that the decision was made, Yaoniang returned to her room. As for Nanny Qian and the others, they were notified and there was no need for Yaoniang to worry about it.After Yaoniang returned to her room, she immediately went to sleep. She slept until the afternoon and was awakened by some movement outside her door.She put on her clothes and went out to take a look.She saw that the door of the room next door, which used to belong to Cuizhu, was open. She walked closer, wanting to take a closer look when someone walked out of the room. The girl looked to be around 20 years old and she had a very plain-looking face.\u201cYou must be Nanny Su! I\u2019m Yuchan.\u201dUpon hearing the first word, Yu, Yaoniang immediately thought of Yuyan. Sure enough, Yuchan said that she was here to serve the little princess. Yaoniang dispelled the doubts in her heart.When the sky turned dark outside, Yaoniang couldn\u2019t help but become nervous.Recently, waiting for Jin Wang\u2019s arrival at night had developed into an inner demon.Speak of the devil and he shall appear. Jin Wang indeed came again that evening.As Yaoniang slept in a daze, she felt someone join in beside her. Immediately, she was startled awake.A large and hot body was tightly wrapped around her. Even though she wore a full set of pyjamas and was completely covered up, she felt like she wasn\u2019t wearing anything.Actually, it wasn\u2019t Yaoniang who didn\u2019t wear clothes. It was Jin Wang who wasn\u2019t wearing anything.\u201cYour highness! Why are you here?\u201d When it became\u00a0haishi\u00a0and Yaoniang saw that Jin Wang hadn\u2019t arrived, she assumed that he was sleeping elsewhere. She went to bed, but who knew that Jin Wang would actually come?(TL: Haishi is the time between 9 pm and 11 pm)\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? You don\u2019t want this prince to come?\u201d\u201cThis servant doesn\u2019t dare.\u201d Yaoniang smiled awkwardly. When Jin Wang\u2019s hand began to roam around, she grabbed onto his hand in a panic.Jin Wang raised his eyebrows and looked at her gloomily. His expression conveyed that if she didn\u2019t give a good excuse, she\u2019d be punished severely.Yaoniang blushed. After a brief pause, she stuttered, \u201cUmmm n-not t-t-tonight. It\u2019s s-s-swollen.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s swollen?\u201dYaoniang almost believed that he asked that on purpose. She lowered her blushing face and said, \u201cThat place\u2026\u201dJin Wang still didn\u2019t understand what she meant. Then he realized.He gazed up and down Yaoniang\u2019s face. \u201cAre you deliberately using that as an excuse to reject this prince?\u201d For some reason, he thought back to before. Even though he was inexperienced, she was someone who had married and even had a child. Yet, they had wasted so many days where they could have slept with each other.When he had returned to his own rooms earlier that day he suddenly thought about this matter. He sulked the entire day over this. Believing that she had deliberately avoided sleeping with him, he felt his dignity as a man had been challenged and insulted.Originally, he didn\u2019t plan on coming tonight. But the more he stewed over it, the more frustrated he became. He couldn\u2019t hold himself back so he arrived later tonight than usual. Yet when he arrived, he saw that she didn\u2019t even wait for him. Instead, she\u2019d come up with excuses to not serve him.Jin Wang remembered what Fucheng had told him about the investigation. Her husband was a simple street vendor who had already passed away. He was a dignified\u00a0qinwang. How could a mere street vendor compare with him?(TL: qinwang is a prince of first rank, usually referring to the emperor\u2019s sons or brothers)What\u2019s so good about her dead husband that she still can\u2019t forget him? To guard against himself and keep her body pure as jade, she used all sorts of methods. If it weren\u2019t for\u2026Thinking up to this point, Jin Wang\u2019s face chilled. The surrounding temperature dropped several degrees.There was an ice kettle in the room to regulate the temperature so it wasn\u2019t too cold or too hot. Yet, Yaoniang couldn\u2019t help but resist the urge to rub her hands together and warm herself up. Seeing the look on his face, what else is there that she couldn\u2019t understand? In her previous life, whenever she looked even a little reluctant, he would show that expression.She was afraid of Jin Wang being angry and she definitely didn\u2019t want to anger him.After she thought for a while, she bit her lower lips and shuffled closer until she reached him.She lowered her head and untied the thin belt around her waist. Then she grabbed onto his hand. Intuitively, he yanked his hand back, but Yaoniang was stubborn and didn\u2019t let go.Then his hand went under her clothes and began to explore.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Yaoniang softened her body and gently leaned against Jin Wang\u2019s chest. Softly, she said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t believe me, feel it yourself.\u201dJin Wang did go and touch that part.Sure enough, it wasn\u2019t the same as before.In a low voice, she continued, \u201cThis servant was sore all day today. Yuyan saw that I was uncomfortable so she asked me to come back and rest. I\u2019m not, really not\u2026\u201d Yaoniang couldn\u2019t finish her words.Jin Wang narrowed his eyes at her.He was so tall that even when sitting there, he was already a head taller than her. She could only reach his shoulders. Snuggled by his side, the pair created a contrast where he appeared strong and powerful while she looked delicate and pitiable.She did look pitiful. Her eyes were slightly bloodshot, her face was pale, and her pearly teeth were biting down on her lips. Jin Wang had an inexplicable urge to stretch out his hand and move her teeth. The little red mouth only belonged to him. Only he could chew on it. She was not qualified.Jin Wang did act on his impulse. He stretched out his fingers to open her mouth, rubbed against the soft lips, then withdrew his hand.He thought to himself that Yaoniang did indeed want to please him.What\u2019s so good about her dead man? Perhaps all his bones were already rotten. How could he compare with him? In terms of social status, he was noble, no need to mention it. As for appearance, very few can defeat him. As for that\u2026Yesterday, he had already tossed her to tears, and today that part was completely swollen.There\u2019s simply nothing worthy of comparison.Thinking up to this point, Jin Wang finally relaxed and let out a deep breath.No longer angry, he turned towards the petite wet nurse. With more affection than before, he said, \u201cLet this prince take a look.\u201dHe thought that he had already spoken very pleasantly, yet he still managed to scare her.Her crimson lips couldn\u2019t stop trembling and her facial expression stiffened. Her face became so red that it gave people an illusion that it would drip blood with a light poke.\u201cWhat? Pardon me?\u201dJin Wang narrowed his eyes slightly.This time, squinting his eyes were no longer effective. There was no way that Yaoniang would show him.Yet, this man, the more you don\u2019t want to show him, the more he wants to see it.In the end, he forcefully took a look.When he saw that original tender flesh was now swollen, he sighed with pity, yet his heart also swelled at the sight.\u201cWhere is the ointment that Fucheng gave you last time?\u201dYaoniang looked at him suspiciously with a bad premonition in her heart. But when Jin Wang continued to pester her for it, she could only take it out from a small drawer beside her bed. She handed the jar to him.Jin Wang applied the ointment for her while Yaoniang buried her face under the blankets, unwilling to come out.Since her body was already like this, there was no need for Jin Wang to remain, so she waited for him to leave.Yet, the thought of leaving didn\u2019t even dawn on him. He laid down on the bed behind her. Seeing that she remained buried under the blankets, fearing that she would suffocate, he forcibly dragged her out. The two of them hugged each other to sleep and Jin Wang didn\u2019t leave until early the next morning.~Ever since he met Yaoniang, Zhou Sheng always thought of her.He yearned for her so much that he would dream frequently and she would always appear in his dreams.Zhou Sheng was almost 20 years old. Many of those around his age were already married and even had children, yet he hasn\u2019t settled down yet.It wasn\u2019t that his parents didn\u2019t worry over this issue, but as a slave, girls from commoner families disdained him. In the mansion, there were servant girls interested in him, but he would look down on them. Up until now, this matter was always delayed.The Zhou family wasn\u2019t rich but was an ordinary farming family from the countryside.That year when his hometown was hit by a natural disaster, his father broke his waist. Eventually, his family could barely feed themselves. Zhou Sheng could only sell himself to be a servant. He was lucky that at that time, the imperial court had mandated Jin Wang to establish his household in Jinzhou. Zhou Sheng entered Jin Wang\u2019s manor and remained there all these years.The servants at Jin Wang\u2019s manor were all treated generously. Zhou Sheng worked as a groom in Jin Wang\u2019s stables and his monthly salary was not low. His fourth sister, Shun\u2019er, later joined the manor too as a servant girl. The two siblings worked together in the manor to earn money and subsidize their family. Eventually, the tough days of the Zhou family were over. Now, they could even be regarded as a wealthy family in the countryside.Naturally, he thought about redeeming himself. The rules for those serving the imperial family members were different from those serving in normal households. Servants working in normal households could redeem themselves when they have the money. Those working for the imperial family members could be released without self-redemption once they reach the right age. Women were released at 20 years old and men were released at 25 years old. Of course, if someone wanted to remain as a servant they could continue to stay. If they chose to stay, there would also be no problem with marrying someone and starting a family of their own. The manor would arrange for everything.Since Zhou Sheng had worked for the manor for many years, he could already get a small house of his own. Yet, since he was still unmarried, he chose to live next to the stables with the other stablemen.After he woke up this morning, he changed out of his clothes and planned to stuff them somewhere. Then, he would wash them when he had some free time. He thought he was being discreet, but he didn\u2019t know that his actions already caught the eyes of his roommates.Six people shared the room and the other five were all older than Zhou Sheng. The other men would often make dirty jokes amongst each other, but Zhou Sheng never participated. With such a great opportunity to tease him, how could the other men let it pass?\u201cYou said you weren\u2019t looking to marry anyone so how do you spend your days?\u201d A groom with a mouthful of large yellow teeth, known as Zheng Huangya, walked up to Zhou Sheng and wrapped his arm around his shoulders.Zhou Sheng was confused and didn\u2019t understand the remark. Seeing him like this, the other men in the room all laughed.\u201cCome here and tell us. Which girl caught your eye? Or is it a servant girl in the manor hmmm?\u201d\u201cWhy didn\u2019t I know there was a servant girl surnamed Yao in this manor?\u201d\u201cTsk-tsk. What kind of person are you? Even those servant girls in charge of disposing of waste are more valuable than you. How would you know their names?\u201dThese words rang true. As servants who did rough labour, those girls serving within the manor looked down on them. Which girl serving within the mansion wasn\u2019t arrogant? How could servants who do rough labour catch their interest? Servants were also split into classes and grooms were probably among the lowest class. Their job was to take care of animals so it\u2019s rare for them to show their faces in front of the masters. So who would be interested in talking with them?Yet, Zhou Sheng was different from the rest of them. He has a younger sister who works as a servant girl. Through his sister, Zhou Sheng also knows a lot of the servant girls within the manor. He often offered to help them and would do them favours, so the girls would all call him Brother Zhou Sheng.The other men in the room were all envious of him. But, there was no point in being envious. Who asked Zhou Sheng to look so handsome? Both the old and the young servant girls were willing to talk with him. For rough men like them, the girls would always be afraid to get too close to them. The servant girls would always avoid them whenever they could.They were indeed a group of rough men with crude words and a ruffian-like appearance. A young man like Zhou Sheng among these people was like an unstained lotus pulled from the mud.The men stopped teasing Zhou Sheng and transitioned the topic to the servant girls. They argued over which girl had the juiciest ass and who had the perkiest boobs. Zhou Sheng stood to the side with a blushing face. He wondered how the other people in the room found out about his secret.He thought it was only his actions this morning that caught their eye. What he didn\u2019t know was that he had talked during his dreams these past few nights. The other men in the room all heard what he had said.As the men discussed, the topic soon returned to Zhou Sheng.\u201cSheng, my advice is to choose a wife with a large ass. Your servant girl surnamed Yao whatever, does she have a juicy ass?\u201dZhou Sheng\u2019s face blushed red like a tomato and he hurriedly excused himself. Then he ran out of the room leaving behind roars of laughter.Even though Zhou Sheng left in a hurry, he couldn\u2019t help but think. How big was Yaoniang\u2019s butt? But, as soon as this thought came up, he buried it. Even if her butt wasn\u2019t large, he would still like her.He stopped, took out a wooden hairpin from his pocket and looked at it. Then, he blushed and stuffed it back into his pocket.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Finally, she could sleep in for a bit and not get up so early.Unexpectedly, as she returned to bed from closing the door, someone knocked on it.At first, Yaoniang thought that Jin Wang had forgotten something and returned to fetch it. Then she realized that he never knocked when visiting her. Even though she would always keep the door tightly fastened every night, he could always come in easily.Who knew how he always found his way in?When Yaoniang opened the door, she saw Ah Xia standing outside.\u201cIt\u2019s so early. Did something happen?\u201dYaoniang looked up at the sky outside. The sun was beginning to rise. Then she remembered that Ah Xia had come knocking on the door soon after Jin Wang had left. Did she see something she wasn\u2019t supposed to see?\u201cNanny Su\u2026\u201d Ah Xia showed a hesitant expression.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? What are you doing?\u201d Yaoniang showed a reluctant expression. But since there was no light in the room and the sky was dark, it wasn\u2019t obvious.\u201cI slept early yesterday so I woke up early this morning. Since Qin\u2019er is on her period these days, I thought I\u2019d help her sweep the yard. Then\u2026you\u2026\u201d Ah Xia seemed like she had more to say, but was afraid to say more.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d Yaoniang strained to suppress the panic that rose in her heart. But, after everything she\u2019s been through, her two lifetimes were not in vain. She managed to show a surprised and puzzled expression as if she truly didn\u2019t understand what Ah Xia meant.Ah Xia glanced at her again, then shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. My eyes must have been blurred. I seemed to have seen a mouse scurrying towards your room. Since your door is closed, it must have not been able to get in. You should still pay attention. If you do find a rat, call someone to help you. Otherwise, it may ruin your clothes and furniture.\u201dYaoniang scrutinized Ah Xia\u2019s expression. Seeing that she didn\u2019t appear to be lying, Yaoniang let out a sigh of relief.\u201cI\u2019ll be careful. Later, when it\u2019s brighter outside, I\u2019ll go take a look. If I do find a rat, I\u2019ll scare it away.Ah Xia quickly nodded her head. \u201cSince you were sleeping, go back and sleep. I won\u2019t disturb you anymore.\u201d When she finished saying her piece, she hurried away.Yaoniang shut her door and returned to her room to continue to rest.The sky was fairly bright. Mist lingered, causing the air to be damp and refreshing. During summer, this time of the day was the most comfortable.Ah Xia clenched the broom in her hand tightly. As she swept the floor, she felt unsettled inside.She had lied to Nanny Su. There was no problem with her vision. She was sweeping the floor with a broom when she directly ran into that person.He was dressed in teal and wore a cold expression on his face. He walked out of the mist like an immortal who had descended into the mundane world.Ah Xia immediately recognized him, so she intuitively avoided him. Yet, the other party shot her a glance with his cold narrow eyes.What kind of glance was it?It was a proud and contemptuous glance, brimming with indifference. Like a towering peak of ice snow that had remained frozen for millennia. There also seemed to be many sharp swords hidden within the gaze.That was a look of warning.Ah Xia was stunned and before she could even react, that person had left already.After a while, Ah Xia finally returned to earth.His highness, Jin Wang, had walked out of the West Wing. Nanny Su\u2019s room was also from that direction. Nanny Su\u2019s status was unique in the courtyard. There was the protection of Yuyan and the others, the resentment of Nanny Qian and Nanny Wang, and the ice kettle from that day. All the events flashed through Ah Xia\u2019s mind one by one.Everything became clear. It turned out that Nanny Su and his highness\u2026She had impulsively gone to knock on Nanny Su\u2019s door as she wondered if her conjectures were true. Yet, as she stood there face to face with her, she hesitated.What could she ask? Ask if there was anything going on between Nanny Su and his highness?She had remembered that look in Jin Wang\u2019s eyes. If she does say something inappropriate\u2026 Ah Xia shuddered. The consequences were not something she could afford.She was just a minor servant girl. Even if there was something going on between Nanny Su and his highness, what does it have to do with her?As Ah Xia swept the ground, she recalled Nanny Su\u2019s appearance in her mind. Her slightly slanted hair bun, her enchanting posture, her lazy demeanour\u2026~The sun hung in the sky like a big fireball. The flowers and grass in the gardens were all listless from basking in the sun. Cicadas screamed feebly and the air was hot and stuffy.Side Consort Hu, who couldn\u2019t tolerate heat, found it especially difficult every summer. She could only arrange for ice to be put out in Liuchun Pavilion.Despite the ice, Side Consort Hu still felt that the heat was intolerable.Not only did her body feel hot, but she also felt hot inside.Summer was always like this. Whenever there was something on her mind, she would feel especially restless and impatient.Recently, Consort Jin arranged for some girls to be brought into the mansion. It was unknown where she had found them from. Consort Jin said that the original servant girls around her were all sent to the other courtyards. Since she needed more manpower, she arranged for more servants. However, Side Consort Hu believed that Consort Jin had ulterior motives.Originally, after Jin Wang was angered by Consort Jin, he didn\u2019t set foot in Siyi Courtyard for many days. Although Jin Wang wasn\u2019t very intimate with Consort Jin, he never dishonoured her. As long as he was in the mansion, he would go to Siyi Courtyard for a meal every now and then. However, ever since that incident, Jin Wang never went again and Consort Jin also became ill.Side Consort Hu believed that she wasn\u2019t actually sick. She was feigning illness as part of her schemes.Fortunately, his highness couldn\u2019t be bothered with her.Side Consort Hu was really happy with the outcome. Yet, she was only happy for a few days before she received the news that Consort Jin had recovered from her illness.Why couldn\u2019t this bitch just die?! She cursed within her heart many times.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 55": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Jin Wang Dotes on His ConcubineCH 39.2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayJin Wang\u2019s mansion was different from other households because its owner was a prince. There was a clear division of labour which was divided into two departments. The departments were for internal affairs and external affairs.The external affairs department consisted of Changshi Mansion, Fengcheng Mansion and Zhaohui Hall. There was also an office for the internal affairs department. The internal affairs department was responsible for everything within the manor. This includes the hiring of the staff members like guards, chefs, and housekeepers. Other things such as salary, clothes and food distribution were also managed by the internal affairs department. The internal affairs department was also in charge of Jin Wang\u2019s rear courtyard, which was where his women lived.The internal affairs consisted of two parts, the rear courtyard and the office. Fucheng was responsible for the internal affairs office. Consort Jin was the head of the rear courtyard. Due to suppression from the internal affairs office, Consort Jin had very little power. She was only responsible for some regulations and the arrangement of servants within each courtyard.Even though this amount of power was very meagre, Side Consort Hu had still set her sights on it.Although it was very limited, this power held the lifeblood of everyone in the rear courtyard. Side Consort Hu doesn\u2019t wish to be constrained or restricted by others. The only way out was to fight.She had taken great pains while Consort Jin was ill, to win over, bribe, and place people in strategic places. Yet as soon as her plans were beginning, Consort Jin recovered. Yet, this wasn\u2019t the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back. It was something else. Otherwise, Side Consort Hu wouldn\u2019t be cursing her like that. What was worse was that Consort Jin had arranged for more young girls to enter the manor. Then, she made it clear that she was grooming them to become a second or third Concubine Feng.The more Side Consort Hu thought of Consort Jin, the more annoyed she became. In her hand was a circular fan that she used to cool herself.\u201cTaohong, go get this concubine some frozen cheese with cherries. It\u2019s too hot.\u201dWhen Taohong, who stood to the side, heard these words, she showed an awkward expression on her faceThe cheese itself wasn\u2019t anything rare and the method to make it wasn\u2019t difficult. Jin Wang\u2019s manor was rich and didn\u2019t lack gold or jade. What kind of delicacy have they not seen? But the cherries\u2026Jin Zhou is a large region of land located by the frontiers. It wasn\u2019t a rich region and no cherries were grown there. A while ago, a basket of cherries was sent as rewards from the capital. But the internal affairs office sent the cherries straight to Siyi Courtyard. All Consort Jin had to do was simply open her mouth and say that she liked to eat cherries. With this simple move, Side Consider Hu couldn\u2019t get even a single cherry.After this incident, the wind in the manor changed directions again. Those people who were previously brought over to Side Consort Hu\u2019s side had become fence-sitters again. They adopted a wait-and-see attitude.Now Side Consort Hu clamoured about wanting to eat frozen cheese with cherries. Isn\u2019t this sending Taohong to Consort Jin to ask for trouble?\u201cYour highness\u2026\u201dSide Consort Hu could obviously notice the hesitance from her trusted maid. Her beautiful eyes gazed around and landed on Cuizhu, who stood beside her holding a fan. \u201cCuizhu, you can go and tell them that the little princess wants to eat cherries.\u201dHow old was the little princess? Are cherries something that she could eat?This was simply using the princess as an excuse to anger others!Cuizhu had an ugly look on her face, but she didn\u2019t dare to refuse. She put down the fan in her hand and silently went out.Taohong watched as Cuizhu left and said, \u201cShe\u2019s really even-tempered. Even though your highness messes with her like so, she still follows your orders.\u201d\u201cSince she is willing, let her be. This concubine has more than enough ways to deal with someone like her.\u201d Side Consort Hu smirked and waved her circular fan. She no longer feels annoyed but is waiting to see tumult and chaos arise from Siyi Courtyard.If Consort Jin did give the cherries, she would be causing herself disgust. Especially, since she knew that this was a scheme deployed by Side Consort Hu. But, if she didn\u2019t give any cherries, that would be looking down on the little princess.The little princess was Jin Wang\u2019s only heir. If she didn\u2019t value the princess, that would be equal to disdaining Jin Wang!This was Side Consort Hu\u2019s trump card. So far, this method hasn\u2019t failed her yet. Whenever she was in a conflict with Consort Jin, as long as she played this card, there would be no fear of losing.Side Consort Hu would not allow the current situation to worsen. Even if she loses an opportunity, she refuses to allow Consort Jin to gain any advantage.\u00a0 The worst-case scenario would be the current situation remaining unchanged. Then both sides would stay evenly matched.Unaware of what\u2019s happening at Siyi Courtyard, Jin Wang dropped a visit to the small courtyard where Yaoniang lived. The small courtyard, where she lived, was separated from Siyi Courtyard by merely a wall. It was a rare occurrence for Jin Wang to have enough leisure time to visit during the daytime.On the second floor of the small building, the windows were wide open. The purple curtains hanging from the window danced in the wind.In this type of hot weather, naturally, there would be ice in the room. In the corner of the room, a large iceberg surrounded by mist stood in the ice kettle. A refreshing breeze blew through the bright room.Behind the bookshelf, Jin Wang read the document held in his hand.Meanwhile, Yaoniang sat on an armchair not far away. From a fine white porcelain plate on the flower table, she held up a bright red and juicy cherry.The bright red-coloured fruit was held in thin white fingers. It was exceptionally pleasing to the eye.Jin Wang squinted his eyes in Yaoniang\u2019s direction. He thought that the cherries indeed suited her.There was a thin layer of ice placed on the bottom of the porcelain plate. Due to the cold, the cherries were covered in condensation. Sweet, tangy, cool, and delicious, Yaoniang ate more than 20 in a row before she stopped.She felt sullen. Normally, she wasn\u2019t a glutton. Yet, today, she had eaten so many in front of Jin Wang. She was unsure whether he would laugh at her.But they were so delicious. She hasn\u2019t even eaten enough yet.She swept her gaze from the few remaining cherries on the plate to Jin Wang by the side. She was very embarrassed. It was his highness who had brought the cherries, but he didn\u2019t even eat any. She was the one who ate them all.\u201cYour highness, would you like to eat any?\u201dJin Wang\u2019s first reaction was that he wasn\u2019t a woman. How could he be interested in these little things? Yet, as he looked from her thin long fingers to her alluring brows, he couldn\u2019t help but feel moved.He raised his eyebrows. Yaoniang, who immediately understood his meaning, walked over with the porcelain plate in her hand.As soon as she reached him, she was pulled onto his lap. Then the great lord raised his eyebrows again. Yaoniang slightly hesitated. Then she picked up a cherry with her dainty fingers and delivered it to his mouth.\u201cIt tastes pretty good,\u201d said Jin Wang.Yaoniang reached out her hand, and a small cherry pit rolled onto her palm.Like this, one person would feed and the other would eat. She also took the opportunity to glance at the document in Jin Wang\u2019s hand. It was quite fun.But as Jin Wang continued to eat, he started to make some movements. Either he would gently bite her finger or he would lick her fingertip with his tongue. Under the desk, one of his hands pressed and rubbed against Yaoniang\u2019s waist. He had a serious expression on his face, but underneath the desk, his hand acted improperly.\u201cYou know what books say? It\u2019s that wine is sweetest when fed by a beauty.\u201d\u00a0 Jin Wang reached out his hand and patted her on the head.After she heard his words, Yaoniang blushed. She intuitively lowered her head and inadvertently glanced at the document in his hand.Only then did she realize. It wasn\u2019t a document. It was clearly a picture book.The book was filled with exquisite illustrations, all depicting the most beautiful thing. The people in the painting were positioned the same way they currently were. There was a person sitting in the other\u2019s lap, but the difference was that the beauty\u2019s clothes were only partially on. It was barely noticeable, but she appeared to be feeding the man by mouth.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 56": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Jin Wang Dotes on His ConcubineCH 40Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayJin Wang\u2019s eyes glinted with interest as Yaoniang\u2019s smile grew stiff.They looked at each other in the eyes.After a long while, Yaoniang gave in. She picked up a cherry with her slim fingers and put it between her lips. She hesitantly passed the cherry to Jin Wang with her mouth.Jin Wang ate the cherry, but he didn\u2019t allow her lips to go free. Instead, her lips were caught in his mouth together alongside the cherry.After some time, Yaoniang lowered her head and panted for air.Jin Wang\u2019s gaze darkened and his thin lips twitched. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you spit it out yet?\u201dHer face immediately blushed. She quickly turned her head and spat out what was in her mouth. The cherry pit landed on the desk and rolled to the very edge before it stopped.He reached out his hand and lifted her palm-sized face. He saw her eyelashes quivering and her glistening pink lips resembled rosy clouds. She looked mesmerizing.As he thought of her moans from last night, Jin Wang\u2019s gaze darkened. A large palm slid up along her slender waist. The fabric of the shirt felt soft and smooth like tofu.He greedily kneaded her waist with his calloused fingers.\u201cYour highness, this servant will go back down.\u201d Yaoniang panted as she pushed him away. Originally, she had come up to serve tea but was retained by Jin Wang with a plate of cherries.Jin Wang ignored her. His large palm was already buried under her clothes.Fucheng, with his arms crossed over his chest, leaned against the door frame on the other side of the door.When he heard the movements inside, he couldn\u2019t help but shake his head.Once men taste the meat, they would be different from those who haven\u2019t. After all, when had his highness ever acted like this before? He was like a cat who discovered a hole filled with fish. All he thought about during the day was to visit the hole. Then he would catch some fish to quench his insatiable appetite.To catch the fish, he learned to use snacks to coax people. Fucheng wondered to what degree was Nanny Su coaxed by his highness.Yet, Fucheng was very happy to see all this. Only when his highness interacted with women, would the manor have any hope of a little prince. Nanny Su also had a good figure for giving birth. Perhaps her first baby would even be a cute chubby boy! Within three years, she might even be able to have two babies!As time passed, a light breeze blew by, and the gauze curtains swayed in the wind.Yaoniang sat pitifully in Jin Wang\u2019s lap. She was still wearing her cyan-coloured summer shirt. The hem of her skirt fell back down and her delicate white skin could no longer be seen. Yaoniang cleared her throat and said, \u201cYour highness, this servant really needs to go back\u2026\u201dShe already repeated this phrase several times but was always ignored by Jin Wang.Half an hour later, Jin Wang finally stopped.Yaoniang laid in his embrace and rested for a while. When she tried to get down, she almost lost her footing. It was Jin Wang who lent her a hand and helped her to stand firm. She was too embarrassed to look at him. She hurriedly straightened her clothes and ran out. When she came out, she saw Fucheng standing by the side. Yaoniang became more self-conscious.As she went down the stairs, she deliberately slowed down her steps. Her speed was like a crawling turtle. She wished that she had a mirror on hand so she could take a look at herself. With even a single mistake in her appearance, others would be aware of what had happened.Fucheng stood outside the door for a little longer before he went in.From behind the bookshelf, Jin Wang was no different than usual. He was reading the file in his hand.All of a sudden, he raised his head. Then he jerked his chin towards the porcelain plate left on the table and what remained of the cherries.\u201cSend some more of this to her.\u201d As for who he was talking about, there was no need to say more.Fucheng looked distressed and hesitated. Then he said, \u201cThere was only a basket of cherries. Since you don\u2019t like to eat them, this servant only left two plates of it. One plate is here while the other was sent to Mammy Mu. The rest of the cherries were sent to Siyi Courtyard.\u201dWhen he saw the unpleasant expression on Jin Wang\u2019s face, he further explained, \u201cYou had ordered for them to be sent.\u201dJin Wang recalled with ease what he\u2019d said.As he thought up to here, he realized that he had given enough days of the cold shoulder to Siyi Courtyard. In his position, whether he favoured someone or not, it didn\u2019t completely rely on whether he wished to. There were times where he does something simply because it must be done. Liuchun Pavilion was becoming more and more arrogant. It was time to suppress it.Besides, Jin Wang felt that it was enough. Although he hated Xu Yanru, he had no plans to do anything like pampering the concubine and neglecting the wife.Yet, it was out of his expectations that Yaoniang likes to eat cherries. But since she likes it, he will give it to her. For Jin Wang, there was nothing that he was afraid to do.\u201cGo personally and ask for some. Say that this prince needs it to reward people.\u201d The entire Jin Manor belonged to him. Jin Wang didn\u2019t think that this move was inappropriate at all. According to Jin Wang, if he wished to give something he could. If he wished to take something back, that was also within his rights.Fucheng looked miserable. When the master makes a mistake, it\u2019s the servants who have to clean up after. Then he thought further. If a servant didn\u2019t clean up after his master, what use would the servant be?At Siyi Courtyard, Cuizhu finished conveying her message then left. Zi Yan hesitated. Then she said, \u201cYour highness if you refused Liuchun Pavilion, would anything bad happen?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with refusing?\u201d said Consort Jin indifferently.\u201cBut the little princess\u2026\u201dConsort Jin sneered and set aside the book in her hands. \u201cShe only sent that servant girl with an excuse. Does she think that his highness would be unaware? Recently, she has been too arrogant so Jin Wang would want to suppress her. There\u2019s no way he would agree to her request.\u201dThis basket of cherries was a sign. Even if her heart was filled with discontent, Consort Jin still had to accept it.What Jin Wang gave to her was dignity. So long as she wished to sit in the high position of Consort Jin, she must accept it. She would even need to smile and say thank you.But her heart felt stifled inside and she desperately wished to vent her anger. Anyways, Jin Wang\u2019s side wouldn\u2019t touch her for now.It was because Consort Jin understood the game too well that she felt especially humiliated. This sense of humiliation eroded her confidence over time. As time went on, she felt less and less like the proud daughter of the Xu family she originally was, before marriage.\u201cAfter Cuizhu returns from this trip, she will suffer,\u201d said Zi Yan with a slight sigh.Cuizhu, herself, was also aware of this. When she left Siyi Courtyard, her face was pale and her eyes were filled with resentment.Zi Yan had served at Consort Jin\u2019s side for many years. She naturally understood the look on Cuizhu\u2019s face. This chess piece of Consort Jin was now completely useless.\u201cShe chose this path herself. This consort already gave her a choice. She dared to reach for things out of her reach. With her status and qualifications, she should\u2019ve been more self-aware.\u201dWasn\u2019t reality like so? Whatever consequences happen, they were only caused by ourselves.Zi Yan stopped talking. At this moment, someone outside the door announced that Eunuch Fu was here.After Fucheng came inside, he greeted Consort Jin. Then he explained the purpose behind this visit.The weather was hot outside, but Consort Jin had a weak constitution, so she never used ice. This meant that those who served alongside her also had to suffer through the heat. Once Fucheng finished explaining, the room was silent. It was so quiet and the air was completely still.Fucheng also noticed the ugly expression on Consort Jin\u2019s face, and he was rather puzzled. But he couldn\u2019t be bothered to guess the other\u2019s thoughts. He simply stood there with a smile on his face as he waited for them to get the cherries.But in the eyes of Consort Jin, it was that bitch, Side Consort Hu, who was wearing that smile.So what if you didn\u2019t plan on giving any? I\u2019ll still send people over. Now even if you didn\u2019t want to give any, you still have to hand them over.\u201cZi Yan, have someone go fetch them for Eunuch Fu. Give them all to him.\u201d\u201cYour Highness\u2026\u201d Zi Yan hesitated a little but she still followed her orders.Fucheng smiled and politely said, \u201cConsort, there\u2019s no need to give everything. I only need\u2026\u201d He paused and thought for a while. Since Jin Wang had ordered it, they were probably for Nanny Su. His highness values her and only thinks about coaxing her all day long. If he only gave a little, it wouldn\u2019t be presentable and his highness would lose face. For Jin Wang to look good, Fucheng said, \u201cHalf of it should be enough.\u201dHalf?!Originally, Consort Jin said those insincere words only for him to hear. Yet, he actually dared to take it seriously?Fucheng left with a basket of cherries and a smile on his face. It wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t notice Consort Jin\u2019s faux pas, but he simply couldn\u2019t be bothered to care. He was a trusted servant of his highness Jin Wang and he only served him. Whether Consort Jin was happy or not, it had nothing to do with him.Besides, deep within Fucheng\u2019s heart was a sense of disgust towards Consort Jin.Fucheng was the only one who worked for Jin Wang that knew what happened from the beginning to the end. That lonely, cold, stubborn young man finally had colour in his life after much difficulty. But what resulted was resistance, revulsion, despise, and even betrayal.Now, that young man had grown up into a fine and upright mature man. The things that he once cared about, no longer weighed on his mind. Yet, the other party changed their attitude again.What a pity. It\u2019s too late.In this world, everything was like so. If you miss the opportunity, you miss it. You won\u2019t be able to turn back and people rarely wish to turn back.Moreover, Fucheng didn\u2019t think that Consort Jin truly wanted to repent. This was simply another method used by the women of nobility to consolidate their status. They would trample the men\u2019s dignity to fulfill their wishes.Fucheng believed that Nanny Su was much better. She was a gentle, kind, and simple woman. Yet, she could make his highness happy and improve his mood. There was also no need for his highness to be wary or apprehensive around her.This was pretty good.Once Fucheng was gone, Consort Jin lost her composure for the first time during her conflicts with Side Consort Hu. She smashed the teacup beside her onto the ground.\u201cThis bitch!\u201d~In the evening, after a tiresome day, Yaoniang returned to her room.The ice was already placed in her ice kettle. Since the three wet nurses had different shifts for work, the internal affairs office ordered the ice to be delivered at a specific time each day. So whenever Yaoniang returned to her room, it would always be nice and cool.She rubbed her waist and was about to wash her face before going to eat dinner when she noticed something. She turned towards her ice kettle and saw a basket with stuff inside, placed on top of it.The basket was covered with a layer of cloth. She walked over, lifted up the piece of cloth, and saw bright, red, and delicious cherries smiling back at her.For some reason, she remembered Jin Wang\u2019s stern face.She snorted inside, yet she couldn\u2019t help but raise her eyebrows.It was because of this basket of cherries that Consort Jin and Side Consort Hu were fighting recently.Consort Jin always valued her appearance and paid attention to propriety. So even when she suppressed Side Consort Hu, it wasn\u2019t too obvious. But now, her previous style had changed. She had adopted more ploys.Actually, she only used the normal methods that legal wives used to mess with the concubines. For example, she would leave them to hang during morning greetings. Or she would ask for them to stay behind and fan her. The fanning may even take up the majority of the day. Recently, Consort Jin liked to summon Side Consort Hu. But she wouldn\u2019t give any orders or instructions. Instead, Side Consider Hu would be forced to stand there and wait.Side Consort Hu suffered from Consort Jin\u2019s ploys several times. Finally, she had enough and went to look for Jin Wang for support. Yet, he couldn\u2019t be bothered by her and completely ignored her. She was filled with anger and hatred. Sadly, in front of Consort Jin, she could only bow down before her. But, in private, Side Consort Hu would curse her and scheme for ways to fight back.With the two masters above fighting like a raging fire, their subordinates couldn\u2019t stay out of it. The maids of Siyi Courtyard and the maids of Liuchun Pavilion fought with each other often. Both sides suffered wins and losses. Their fights almost left the manor in shamblesYaoniang usually stays within the courtyard and doesn\u2019t go out to mingle. These were all gossip that she heard from those who also worked in her courtyard. This topic was discussed every day within the courtyard and it was like listening to a drama.But instead of being the protagonist in her previous life, Yaoniang watched the show as a bystander in this life.As an onlooker watching the drama unfold, Yaoniang sighed and wondered what was the point to all this. Indeed, for onlookers, there really was no point in all this drama. But for those that stood in the centre of the conflict, it was a matter of life and death.From her experiences in her past life, Yaoniang also understood this point clearly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Yuyan and Yucui had become more restrictive after Jin Wang\u2019s last visit to the small courtyard. During his last visit, he found no one working at their posts.Yaoniang came to the small kitchen to get her lunch.The meals for the wet nurses were made separately. To produce the best milk to feed the little princess, the nurses\u2019 meals were all first-class. There were chicken, duck, lamb, and fish. None of the meals were repeated. Additional fruits and snacks were also provided.For today\u2019s meal, besides the dishes of meat and vegetable, there was also soup. It was a soup of pig trotters with soybeans and herbs. This soup was good for promoting milk production and served as nourishment for the wet nurses.Flowers floated at the surface of the milky white stew. Within the soup, pieces of pig trotters and soybeans bobbed up and down. The chef began to stew the soup before sunrise and it was simmered slowly over a low fire. Now, she opened up the lid of the pot and a savoury aroma swirled through the air. The people who stood nearby, couldn\u2019t help but salivate at the smell.\u201cIt smells sooo good! What delicious food did Mommy Mo make today? Let me try some.\u201d The speaker was a young servant girl named Xiao Man. Whenever she saw something yummy, she would want to try it.When she first entered the small courtyard, she was very thin. Now, she more closely resembled a chubby ball. According to the nannies who worked in the kitchen, she was round enough to be butchered for a New Year\u2019s celebration. These words weren\u2019t meant to be reprimands but were said with helplessness and even hints of pride.Xiao Man\u2019s mouth was very sweet and she was a hard worker. Everyone loved her very much.Seeing that Xiao Man was gluttonous again, Mommy Mo laughed. She slapped away Xiao Man\u2019s outstretched chubby paws and said, \u201cThis was prepared for the wet nurses. You can\u2019t eat this.\u201dXiao Man gulped and enviously said, \u201cNanny Su and the others have really great meals. If I could eat their food every day, it would be great.\u201dOld Lady Wang, who stood at the side and was filling a large basin with cooked dishes, heard this and laughed. She joked, \u201cIf you want to eat their meals, it won\u2019t be easy. First, you have to find someone to marry. Then, you need to have a kid. But being a nanny is a pretty nice job with decent pay.Old Lady Zhao was angered. \u201cYou uncultured swine! Xiao Man is still young. Telling her this, aren\u2019t you afraid of misleading her?\u201d As she said this, she stuffed some fennel seeds to Xiao Man. \u201cHere, you can eat these instead.\u201dXiao Man thanked her and ran away with a big grin. The servant girls like her, who did labour work, were usually the last to enjoy lunch.Mommy Mo saw Yaoniang walk in. She smiled and said to her, \u201cNanny Su is here early today.\u201dYaoniang nodded. \u201cThe little princess is asleep so I came here first. Later, Yuyan will come and we will switch.\u201dThe wet nurses\u2019 meals were already prepared and served on the plates. Mommy Mo looked at Yaoniang hesitantly and asked, \u201cI stewed some pig trotters today. Do you want any?\u201dYaoniang didn\u2019t like to eat meat. She especially disliked this type of meat stew. Yet, to produce enough milk for the princess, she does try to eat as much meat as possible. But she would never drink the broth. Despite not drinking the broth, Yaoniang produced enough milk so it didn\u2019t really matter. Mommy Mo also knew about this, which was why she asked.Unexpectedly, the sun must have risen from the west today because Yaoniang nodded.Although Mommy Mo was surprised, she didn\u2019t say anything. People\u2019s tastes were constantly changing. Even if you didn\u2019t like something yesterday, you could like it today. There was nothing wrong with that.Yaoniang carried her lunchbox and returned to her bedroom to eat.She opened her lunchbox and took out the dishes one by one. Although the dishes couldn\u2019t be described as gorgeous in colour or rich in flavour, the quantity was there. There was a small plate of everything.Bite by bite, Yaoniang slowly ate the meat.If others were to see this, they would be shocked senseless. After all, Yaoniang preferred vegetables over meat.It was obvious that Yaoniang struggled to down the meat. But she continued to eat. Soon, she finished an entire bowl of rice along with some vegetables.Her appetite was not small. Despite being completely full, she still forced herself to drink the entire bowl of greasy pig trotters stew.When she finished eating, she felt like there was still food stuck in her throat.There was a reason why Yaoniang forced herself to eat like this. Recently, she discovered that her supply of milk was decreasing.She didn\u2019t think much of it at first. But as the little princess\u2019s appetite increased day by day, the deficiency became more and more obviousLogically, this situation shouldn\u2019t happen to Yaoniang. She was a mother in both of her lifetimes and raised several babies. She understood how to keep an ample supply of milk. She would squeeze some out at a fixed time every day, regardless of whether she already fed the princess. This way, as long as her intake of nutrition remained constant, her milk shouldn\u2019t decrease.Yet now, even though she squeezed out milk every day, her supply dwindled. She could even feel the volume of milk production decreasing.Yaoniang began to panic. She was a wet nurse! What kind of wet nurse could not produce milk? Soon, she could lose her job! At first, she was angry with Jin Wang and blamed him for causing this situation.But since she was used to being timid, she didn\u2019t dare to complain when she was with him. She could only dodge or avoid whenever it was possible. Yet, she didn\u2019t forget to carefully observe. From her observations, she realized that it had nothing to do with Jin Wang. She was furious.But why was there less milk?After thinking about it, Yaoniang believed that it must have something to do with her diet. It must be because she didn\u2019t eat enough meat, hence the situation today.Yaoniang ate a little too much so she didn\u2019t dare to recklessly move around. She rested in her room for a while to digest before making her way to the kitchen with her used dirty dishes. Then she went to the small building and switched with Yuyan so she could go enjoy her lunch.A day passed by in a flash. After Nanny Qian and Nanny Wang came over to take their shifts, Yaoniang returned to her room.She fetched some water to prepare for a bath when she heard some movement outside.Yaoniang opened the door of her room and peeked out. There was a loud noise coming from the small building mixed with the cries of the little princess. Something seemed to have happened.Without taking any extra time to think, she closed her door behind her and went to the small building. When she entered the room, she saw Mammy Mu\u2019s frightening expression. Nanny Qian and Nanny Wang were also upset. Yucui held the crying princess with an ugly expression on her face. Only Yuyan was missing.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Lu\u2019er and some of the other servant girls also rushed over anxiously.\u201cWhat happened?\u201dNanny Qian saw that Yaoniang arrived. She pointed at Yaoniang and said, \u201cMammy, Nanny Wang and I just arrived for our shifts and we didn\u2019t even have the chance to feed the little princess yet. It must have been Nanny Su who was gluttonous and ate something she shouldn\u2019t have. Otherwise, how could the princess be like this?\u201dWhen Yaoniang heard these accusations, she was stunned.Before she even bothered to defend herself, she hurried over to Yucui\u2019s side.In her arms laid the little princess with red rashes all over her face. The little princess had cried herself hoarse so her face was completely flushed. This caused her rashes to look even more swollen.Hearing Nanny Qian\u2019s accusations, Mammy Mu looked over with sharp eyes.Yaoniang began to explain.\u201dI didn\u2019t eat anything weird. I only ate the food from the small kitchen.\u201dNanny Qian couldn\u2019t let the matter drop like that. She asserted, \u201cYou can easily tell the princess has a rash at first glance. At her current age, she can only drink breast milk. It must have been the wet nurse who ate something bad, causing the princess to be like this. Nanny Su, if you ate something you shouldn\u2019t have, hurry up and confess. Don\u2019t prolong the princess\u2019s illness. Otherwise, no one would be able to save you.\u201d\u201cMammy, this servant didn\u2019t eat anything wrong.\u201dMammy Mu instinctively believed that Nanny Su had nothing to do with this. She was partial towards Yaoniang because she knew about the special relationship between her and Jin Wang. But it was also because of this relationship that she had some doubts with her heart.Everyone in the manor knew that Jin Wang favoured Side Consort Hu. A woman\u2019s jealousy was terrifying. Mammy Mu understood this extremely well from her year of working within the imperial palace.Even a woman who was docile and virtuous could do all sorts of terrible things because of jealousy. Within the palace, imperial concubines miscarried and baby princes died. Although infants indeed had a high mortality rate, everyone knew that the truth wasn\u2019t so simple.Indeed, the truth wasn\u2019t simple. The culprits must have been one of the countless beautiful women in the palace.Was it possible that Yaoniang was jealous of Side Consort Hu so she tried to harm the little princess? Even if this matter wasn\u2019t caused by jealousy, Yaoniang was someone that Consort Jin had dispatched. Recently, those two women were fighting like fire and water. Could it be Consort Jin who ordered Yaoniang to ruin Side Consort Hu\u2019s greatest pillar of support?All kinds of thoughts flashed through Mammy Mu\u2019s mind. After she heard Yaoniang\u2019s explanation, she chose to remain silent.Mammy Mu\u2019s attitude influenced the other maids within the room. Lu\u2019er and Yucui\u2019s gazes toward Yaoniang were now filled with suspicion.Yaoniang was a little dejected. Ever since she came to work in the small courtyard, she was sincere and diligent. The people in the courtyard all treated her with affection. Although some may have had other motives behind their kindness, she always thought that Yucui and Lu\u2019er sincerely treated her well.As people who served the little princess, their only wish was for the princess to be well. Since everyone had the same goal, they shared a sense of intimacy.But now this sense of intimacy was destroyed by the sudden change.Why was it so fragile? Why did no one believe her?At this moment, Yucui suddenly spoke up. \u201cNanny Qian, don\u2019t say anything if you don\u2019t have evidence. We all know Nanny Su\u2019s character. She isn\u2019t a liar.\u201dYaoniang felt strengthened when she heard this.She glanced at Yucui gratefully. Then she turned to Mammy Mu and said, \u201cMammy, this servant only ate the food that was served from the small kitchen and didn\u2019t eat anything else. Please uncover the truth behind this matter.\u201d\u201cWho knows whether you ate anything bad or not?\u201d retorted Nanny Qian.Mammy Mu pondered for a moment. Then she said, \u201cGuilty or not, now isn\u2019t the time to decide. Whether Nanny Su had caused the princess to become sick will be decided by his highness.\u201dAs she was speaking, Yuyan hurriedly led Doctor Liu into the room.Doctor Liu was an old man in his sixties. He was as thin as a stick and had a goatee. He originally was an imperial physician that served within the imperial palace. But when Jin Wang came to Jinzhou to establish his manor, he followed him to Jinzhou too. He was a well-respected doctor who served within Jin Wang\u2019s manor and had excellent medical skills.He entered the room with Yuyan and approached the princess. He instructed the servants to lay the princess on the bed. Then he took a silver needle from his assistant behind him and carefully inserted it into an acupuncture point on the princess\u2019s neck. She calmed down right away and fell unconscious.\u201cThis kind of crying isn\u2019t good for her. Let her rest first.\u201d When he finished speaking, he reached out a hand to take her pulse.By this time, not only had Side Consort Hu arrived, but Jin Wang and Consort Jin also arrived.The three of them rushed over. Obviously, they came as soon as they had heard the news.When Side Consort Hu came in and saw the state of her daughter, she started weeping. Started to blabber about how pitiful her baby was and then she started to blame Yuyan and the others.Consort Jin frowned and her expression was solemn. \u201cSide Consort Hu, beware of propriety. Doctor Liu is treating the little princess right now. Can you please shut up?\u201dTruth was that Consort Jin didn\u2019t want to be here. She couldn\u2019t wait to see Side Consort Hu get in trouble. If something happened to the little princess, she\u2019d be happier than anyone else. It was a pity that as the hostess of the manor, it was her obligation to show up.After Jin Wang came in, he immediately sat down on a nearby chair. Fucheng stood behind him.His handsome face was cold and solemn. His left hand fidgeted with the sapphire ring on his right hand. Those familiar with him would know that he was feeling uneasy.After Side Consort Hu heard Consort Jin\u2019s words, not only did she not listen, she also refuted it with sentences of her own. Jin Wang immediately snorted. The temperature of the room chilled and it was like falling into an ice cellar.Suddenly, everyone was afraid to speak and the sound of breathing was barely audible. The room was silent as if there was no one there.After a while, Doctor Liu released a breath of air, breaking the silence.\u201cIt appears that the little princess ingested something inappropriate, causing rashes to break out.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The only thing that she could ingest was milk.But Doctor Liu said that her rash was caused by ingesting something bad. Needles to say, it must have come from the milk of one of the three wet nurses.Whatever the wet nurse ate would become a part of her milk. This milk would then be fed to the princess. Everyone understood this. Their gazes focused on Yaoniang and the other wet nurses.Along with these pairs of eyes, one of them belonged to Jin Wang.His complexion was dark and his eyes were dull. No one could tell what he was thinking.Yaoniang couldn\u2019t help but withdraw into herself. She didn\u2019t dare to look up at Jin Wang. Nanny Qian had insisted that she ate something she shouldn\u2019t have, which in turn harmed the princess. Would Jin Wang believe in those words?Sure enough, as soon as these thoughts flashed in Yaoniang\u2019s mind, Nanny Qian spoke up again.She angrily said to Mammy Mu, \u201cMammy, this servant didn\u2019t speak wrongly. It must have been Nanny Su who ate something bad in private which caused the princess to look like this. It was Nanny Su\u2019s shift during the day. Sister Wang and I didn\u2019t even have the chance to feed the princess yet after we arrived. The rash on the princess appeared just now. According to usual practice, Nanny Su would feed the princess before she leaves her shift. If it wasn\u2019t because of her, who would it be?!\u201dAs soon as she finished her tirade, everyone\u2019s gazes all landed on Yaoniang again.With so many people staring at her, Yaoniang felt uncomfortable. She took a step back and forced herself to remain calm as she started to defend herself. \u201cThis servant really didn\u2019t eat anything indiscriminately\u2026\u201d She paused. \u201cYucui can testify.\u201dNanny Qian interrupted. \u201cYucui girl, you need to be partial. If you don\u2019t make it clear, the responsibility will land on Nanny Wang and me. We didn\u2019t even feed anything to the princess yet after we arrived for our shift.\u201dYucui hesitated then said, \u201cNanny Su did feed the baby right before she finished her shift. As for Nanny Qian and Nanny Wang, they haven\u2019t fed the baby yet after they started their shifts\u2026\u201dBefore she even finished speaking, Side Consort Hu flew over like a gust of wind and slapped Yaoniang on the face. Her speed made everyone go speechless.With a crisp smack, Yaoniang\u2019s face whipped to the side. Her milky white skin became red and swollen.Fucheng\u2019s mouth parted in surprise. Mammy Mu\u2019s gaze condensed while Yucui and Yuyan looked towards Jin Wang.Jin Wang showed no expressions on his face. Only his darkened eyes revealed the slightest hint.Consort Jin frowned and scolded, \u201cSide Consort Hu, aren\u2019t you too impulsive? Do you still have the stature that a Side Consort should have?\u201dSide Consort Hu turned towards her with a sneer. \u201cWhether this concubine has the stature or not, this concubine is aware. This concubine now wants to ask what your highness had meant. Does your highness wish to protect this presumptuous and evil servant?\u201dConsort Jin was irritated. \u201cSide Consort Hu, your words made this consort a little confused. This consort thought that convicting someone like that would be unfair and immoral. Everyone knows about her efforts from before that helped stop the princess\u2019s bawling. Yaoniang should be given a chance to defend herself.\u201dSide Consort Hu couldn\u2019t be bothered with Consort Jin anymore. Instead, she bitterly looked at Yaoniang as if she wanted to swallow her whole. \u201cYou little bitch, if there\u2019s anything wrong with the little princess, even your life isn\u2019t enough as compensation. Servants, come! Drag this despicable servant out! This concubine will teach her a lesson that she will never forget!\u201dConsort Jin was furious.When Side Consort Hu\u2019s voice fell, servants who stood outside, followed her commands and came in.Yaoniang covered her face and desperately shook her head. \u201cThis servant didn\u2019t! This servant didn\u2019t eat anything indiscriminately! The whole day was spent by the princess\u2019s side. The only food this servant had was from the small kitchen! This servant worked alongside Yuyan the entire shift. Yuyan and the other servants would know whether this servant ate anything bad!\u201d With that said, she couldn\u2019t help but peek at Yuyan and Yucui.Yuyan hesitated a little. Then she said, \u201cThis servant honestly didn\u2019t see Nanny Su eat anything else.\u201d\u201cThis servant also didn\u2019t see anything,\u201d followed Yucui immediately.Yaoniang let out a sigh of relief. But before she could even finish her exhale, she heard Nanny Qian say, \u201cBut if she didn\u2019t eat anything bad, the princess wouldn\u2019t be like this. Plus, Yuyan and Yucui, were you guys with Nanny Su the entire time? How could you be sure that Nanny Su didn\u2019t eat anything behind your backs?\u201dFaced with such rapid interrogation, Yucui and Yuyan looked towards each other. \u201cThis\u2026..This couldn\u2019t be guaranteed.\u201dAt that moment, Mammy Mu coughed. \u201cInvite Mommy Mo to come over.\u201dLu\u2019er nodded and immediately left.A short while later, Mommy Mo came in. She was briefed about the situation on the way here. Once she was inside, she took out a piece of paper.\u201cThe three nannies\u2019 meals were arranged according to the orders of the doctor. There should be nothing inappropriate. Today\u2019s meal for the three nannies included\u2026\u201dShe reported a series of ingredients and Doctor Liu nodded as he listened. Once Mommy Mo finished speaking, Doctor Liu said, \u201cThe princess shouldn\u2019t have developed a rash from ingesting these foods.\u201dMammy Mu nodded and Mommy Mo left.The room was silent.Side Consort Hu sneered. She opened her mouth to speak when Mammy Mu said, \u201cA few of you go and search Nanny Su\u2019s room. Since everyone has their own doubts, it\u2019s better to clear everything up once and for all.\u201dShe said that last sentence while looking towards Yaoniang.Yaoniang looked at her with gratitude in her eyes. \u201cThank you, Mammy. This servant knows that the truth will speak for itself.\u201dYuyan led some servants to go search. Taohong was one of the servants that went to search as well.Side Consort Hu didn\u2019t trust Mammy Mu and the other servants so she ordered Taohong to go along.The room was very quiet. Only the sound of Doctor Liu\u2019s instructions to his assistant could be heard. Only a little time had gone by, but it seemed like years had gone by to those in the room.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She couldn\u2019t help but glance at Side Consort Hu from time to time.Side Consort Hu stood there anxiously. She couldn\u2019t help but approach Doctor Liu and ask about the little princess in a low voice. She seemed to be very worried about her.After all, she had carried the princess for ten months in her belly before giving birth. It was normal for Side Consort Hu to be worried and anxious.Although nothing seemed abnormal, Consort Jin still couldn\u2019t help but feel uneasy.Before she could figure out where her anxiety came from, Yuyan and the others returned.Without giving Yuyan a chance to speak, Taohong held up a plate in her hand. She said to Side Consort Hu, \u201cMy lady, there was a plate of crab buns in Nanny Su\u2019s room. When we found it, there was only one cold bun left. There were traces of residue still on the plate. It appears to be someone\u2019s leftovers from a meal.\u201dWhen he heard this, Doctor Liu looked over. \u201cIf it was crab, that would explain the rashes on the princess\u2019s face. This type of food could cause all kinds of ailments, especially for babies. So, crabs are a big no-no for pregnant women. For those who are breastfeeding the baby, it is also forbidden. It seems like the princess\u2019s rashes were caused by crabs.\u201dSide Consort Hu looked at Yaoniang with a cold smile on her face. \u201cWhat else can you say? As the wet nurse of a princess, there are many foods you are forbidden to eat. Yet you couldn\u2019t restrain yourself and privately ate it. Servants come! Throw this servant out!\u201dYaoniang was stunned by the discovery of the crab buns. She had no idea how the buns came to be in her room.But she was very self-aware and knew how much trouble she was in. She knew that someone had deliberately planted the buns to frame her. But she had no proof that she didn\u2019t eat the buns. All the evidence showed that she was the culprit.Now, what should she do?She couldn\u2019t help but look at the other servants that worked in the courtyard with her. They all avoided her gaze.It was just as she\u2019d expected. With all the evidence provided, who would be willing to speak up for her?Yaoniang\u2019s heart fell. Actually, there was still someone who could help her. But she didn\u2019t dare to even look at him.Ever since Jin Wang arrived, Yaoniang didn\u2019t dare to look into his eyes.It was probably from a feeling of inferiority. She was also scared others would find out about their relationship. Now she still doesn\u2019t dare to look at him, but it was from a different type of inferiority.It was inferiority from lack of self-confidence and uncertainty.She was only a servant. How could she compare with Side Consort Hu, much less the little princess who was Jin Wang\u2019s only child?It was impossible for Jin Wang to protect her.Yaoniang\u2019s impression of Jin Wang from her last life was imprinted deeply in her mind. She understood that the man in the bed and the man off the bed were two completely different people.She was only a plaything.These kinds of thoughts were too deeply rooted and were always at the back of Yaoniang\u2019s mind. But ever since she started sleeping with Jin Wang she did her best to avoid them.She didn\u2019t want to think about it. This way, she could still have the illusion that he somewhat liked her.It didn\u2019t matter where the source of his liking was from.True, Jin Wang was a little different in this lifetime, but Yaoniang always believed that people couldn\u2019t easily change. Let alone someone as cold-hearted as Jin Wang.Jin Wang in her previous life also acted dotingly towards her. But as time went by, she realized it was all in her mind.To put it bluntly, Jin Wang only used her to warm his bed.This was why Yaoniang didn\u2019t dare to look at Jin Wang. She was scared of seeing something she didn\u2019t want to see.She was a poor person who had nothing. With nothing in her pockets, she couldn\u2019t afford to gamble. She would rather not take her chances.Jin Wang frowned. He stared at the woman whose head hung down as if she had given up all resistance.He was sitting right there. Why didn\u2019t she ask for his help?Does she not trust him? It had already progressed to such a stage but she still didn\u2019t want to expose their relationship! Did she feel ashamed from sleeping with him? Was her dead husband more important to her? Was she coming up with ways to leave the manor so she would rather be punished instead of\u2026Seeing the red handprint on her swollen face, Jin Wang felt irritated inside.His expression chilled.Fucheng looked at him, but he didn\u2019t say anything.Consort Jin\u2019s brows furrowed deeper, but she also didn\u2019t say anything.It seemed like the matter had come to an end. Side Consort Hu\u2019s people came up to grab Yaoniang. But at this moment Side Consort Hu spoke up again.\u201cWait.\u201dEveryone turned their gazes toward her again. Consort Jin\u2019s pupils shrunk when she realized that Side Consort Hu was looking at her.\u201cShe is a wet nurse and she knows that crabs are taboo to eat, but she still secretly ate them. The manor is strict. How could a wet nurse like her be able to get her hands on something like crab?\u201d Side Consort Hu faced Consort Jin with a sharp light in her gorgeous eyes. \u201cYour highness, this wet nurse was sent to the princess\u2019s side by you. Don\u2019t you have anything to explain?\u201dAfter she said this she seemed to have lost all her strength. She stumbled at Jin Wang\u2019s feet and started to weep. \u201cYour highness, you have to get justice for this concubine and the princess! It was clearly the Consort that wished to harm the princess. She simply borrowed the hand of the wet nurse!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Side Consort Hu had directed each scene one after another. Yet, if she didn\u2019t target Consort Jin at the end, no one would\u2019ve realized her ploy.After all, the little princess that she carried in her womb for ten months was her greatest pillar of support. Who would\u2019ve thought that she was ruthless enough to risk an infant\u2019s life to deal with Consort Jin?Even Consort Jin didn\u2019t think of it.But to complete her last step, she completely exposed her intentions. Now it was clear that everything she did before was a result of deliberate scheming.The origin of the little princess\u2019s rash was already ambiguous. Nanny Su also wasn\u2019t foolish. Wet nurses knew that crabs were a big taboo and that they were forbidden. If Nanny Su was ordered by Consort Jin it would make more sense. But was Consort Jin a foolish person?Was she someone who would order a servant she\u2019d strategically placed to do such a shameful thing under broad daylight? It would make a lot more sense if it was Side Consort Hu\u2019s people who acted this farce out.This play had started from the very beginning, and it was a ruthless one. After all, it involved the little princess. At first, the situation of the little princess was terrible. Almost everyone was thrown into a state of panic. Now, the princess was still in a serious condition, but with the presence of Doctor Liu, it was no longer life-threatening. When everyone calmed down, their reasoning also returned. It wasn\u2019t difficult to understand that not all was as it appeared.Mammy Mu\u2019s gaze grew meaningful, and Jin Wang\u2019s eyes flickered. His face remained expressionless as usual, but he relaxed a bit into his seat.Side Consort Hu was still weeping and it seemed like she didn\u2019t realize her motive was already exposed. Perhaps she wouldn\u2019t have been afraid even if she did realize it. After all, this scheme of hers was not easy to resolve. Since she dared to arrange all this, she would definitely not leave any loopholes.On the other side of the room, after some thinking, Consort Jin stepped forward. \u201cAsking your highness to be fair. Even if this consort was stupid, ordering a person arranged to serve the princess to do this kind of thing would still be too much.\u201d Compared to what Side Consort Hu had done, it was clear that Consort Jin\u2019s attitude was more open and upright.Side Consort sneered and retorted, \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s Consort who is taking advantage of this matter. Thinking that no one would suspect you, you carefully arranged everything. Who doesn\u2019t understand the concept that even the darkest shadows are caused by light?\u201dConsort Jin did not retreat. \u201cWho knows whether Side Consort Hu is willing to use the little princess as leverage to deal with this Consort? This consort isn\u2019t blaming you, Side Consort Hu, but the princess is so small. Are you not afraid of an accident occurring? Are you not afraid of stealing the chicken only to lose the rice?\u201dConsort Jin was too calm, and her words had hit the nail right on the head. Side Consort Hu\u2019s face instantly changed.She hid her face behind her hands and started to cry again. \u201cHow could Consort slander this concubine like that? The little princess was born after this concubine had carried her in the womb for ten months. This concubine had a foot in the grave during the delivery process. Who would use their own children as a way to harm others? Those who have such thoughts, either they are vicious, or they can\u2019t give birth to children themselves. They don\u2019t understand the feeling of being a mother. Parents with children would rather themselves suffer in place of their child. Your highness, you must get justice for the little princess\u2026\u201dAlthough Side Consort Hu had cried and complained, the meaning behind her words was that Consort Jin could not give birth to a child. This was pointing at the mulberry tree while cursing the locust tree! Consort Jin\u2019s expression blackened immediately. Her back was straight and her lips pursed together. \u201cThere is no need for this consort to do this type of thing. Beseeching your highness to be fair.\u201dJin Wang was silent and it seemed like he was thinking over something.Side Consort Hu continued to pursue the matter. She pulled out her trump card. \u201cSince Consort insists that it was this concubine who had wronged the princess, let\u2019s have the Nanny confess. Under whose instigation did she do such a horrific thing?\u201dThe spearhead finally pointed at Yaoniang again. No one was surprised by this result.Side Consort Hu wanted to pin the crime on Consort Jin. Consort Jin couldn\u2019t sit still under the verbal onslaught. Yaoniang happened to be caught in the middle. This was a classic example of mortals suffering when the gods fought.With a pale face, Yaoniang smiled deprecatingly. She knew that the situation would turn out like this. Although it appeared at last that the matter had nothing to do with her, she still couldn\u2019t relax her nerves.Sure enough, this moment arrived!\u201cThink carefully. Don\u2019t be fooled by other people. You must know that harming the little princess is an act with terrible consequences.\u201d Side Consort Hu looked at Yaoniang with threats obvious in her eyes. \u201cBut if you tell the truth, that you were forced by someone, his highness may spare your life.\u201dHelping Consort Jin not only wouldn\u2019t gain her any favour but could also cause her to lose her life. Yet, if she told \u2018the truth\u2019, not only would she be seen in a new light by others, Jin Wang would also protect her life.In the entire Jin Wang Manor, Jin Wang himself was the most powerful person.This choice did not seem too difficult to make. Even if Yaoniang was instructed by Consort Jin to harm the princess, Side Consort Hu had already cleared away the barriers for her. As long as she wasn\u2019t stupid, she would know what to choose.Yaoniang looked at Jin Wang. This was the first time that she glanced at him ever since he came into the room.She wasn\u2019t sure why she wanted to see him, but she knew that she wanted to look at him.Most likely, he would be partial towards Side Consort Hu. But she wasn\u2019t willing to do anything that was against her conscience. Yaoniang felt resistant to the very idea. She was innocent anyways. Why must she pour the dirty water on someone else? Simply to fulfill Side Consort Hu\u2019s selfishness?Many choices seem to be easy to make. But there would always be something that people overlook and ignore. It could be their conscience, reputation, persistence, or simply a bottom line.Some people, perhaps, wouldn\u2019t care about these things. They would think that if they were lost, then they were lost. For other people, these concepts were no less important than their own life. They were basic principles of living as a human being.Jin Wang narrowed his eyes.Yaoniang hung her head and said, \u201cThis servant doesn\u2019t understand the meaning of Side Consort Hu. This incident has greatly wronged this servant. This servant never ate any crab buns and doesn\u2019t know how they even came to be in this servant\u2019s room!\u201d\u201cWell, you are one bold servant! You still dare to argue!\u201d Side Consort Hu was enraged. \u201cServants! Drag her out and beat her until she confesses!\u201dSeveral servants approached Yaoniang to drag her out.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When she confronted the other person, she claimed that Nanny Su was instigated by her.She looked at Yaoniang anxiously and wondered if she would be able to bear the beatings.Just then, Jin Wang spoke up.\u201cIt was rewarded to her by this prince.\u201dAlthough the words were said lightly, everyone in the room was shocked and their jaws dropped.Especially Side Consort Hu. With a face of disbelief, she stuttered, \u201cY-your highness\u2026\u201dYaoniang was also shocked and she lifted her head to look at Jin Wang.Jin Wang did not make eye contact with her but looked at Side Consort Hu.\u201cYour highness! This\u2026 you\u2026 her\u2026 how is this possible\u2026?\u201d Side Consort Hu was incoherent, and her pair of phoenix eyes wide open. She gave others the feeling that she was about to fall apart in an instant.Jin Wang looked cold and indifferent. He stared at her and said, \u201cSince this prince said it was a reward from this prince, then it was a reward from this prince. This prince said that she didn\u2019t have it, then she didn\u2019t have it. You dare to disagree?\u201d The last sentence was said in a very low voice. Each word was slowly enunciated, one at a time.It was a warning. Jin Wang\u2019s eyes expressed how serious he was.Side Consort Hu\u2019s face paled and she lost her ability to speak.\u201cThis matter is over. If this prince finds out that one of you had meddled in this matter\u2026\u201d Jin Wang stood up and looked around at everyone in the room. He did not finish the words but left with Fucheng.The room was completely silent. No one expected that it would end like this.Jin Wang\u2019s solution was arrogant, but no one dared to call him arrogant.Jin Wang was the master of this manor. His words were the law. Even if he called the deer a horse, and turned black into white, everyone would acknowledge it as fact. Even if they couldn\u2019t understand his actions, they knew that this farce disgusted Jin Wang.Only some people believed that they understood. But the direction that they were thinking in, was not the same. Mammy Mu and her confidantes were not surprised by how the farce had ended. Others thought that Jin Wang was maintaining Consort Jin\u2019s dignity, so he chose to protect her.Side Consort Hu was one of those that thought in the latter direction. She never would have thought that the scheme, which she had worked hard to arrange, would end up like this.But was there anyone that dared to argue? No one dared! Jin Wang\u2019s phrase \u201cYou have any objections?\u201d already left her speechless!Although Side Consort Hu was very embarrassed, she still wasn\u2019t afraid to look at Consort Jin. \u201cYour highness has some skills!\u201dConsort Jin seemed to be thoughtful. She stared at the other woman and sneered.Side Consort Hu left, and most of the room suddenly became empty. Those who had been grabbing onto Yaoniang had followed behind her.Consort Jin approached Yaoniang. With her hands folded in front of her, she gazed at her from top to bottom. With a smile hanging from her mouth, she said, \u201cYou\u2019re skilled.\u201d After that, she took her people and left.With the departure of Consort Jin and Side Consort Hu, Doctor Liu also bid goodbye. His prescription was already being brewed and all that\u2019s left is for the little princess to drink it. He\u2019d return later to do another check-up.He explained everything that required extra attention. Then, Doctor Liu said that he needed to go back to his office and double-check if he had missed anything in the prescription. He also said that he\u2019d be back shortly. Once he finished his words, he hurried out.Only the servants that worked in the small courtyard remained.\u201cYou\u2019re really unlucky.\u201d Yucui sighed and stepped forward to comfort Yaoniang. \u201cDon\u2019t overthink it. We all believe you.\u201dYuyan sighed, and although she didn\u2019t say anything, she also sympathized with Yaoniang.\u201cYeah, Nanny Su. Don\u2019t worry, we all know that you wouldn\u2019t do this type of thing\u2026\u201d Luyao was going to continue when she was pulled away by Lu\u2019er.Lu\u2019er looked at Nanny Qian, and Luyao followed her gaze.Not only Luyao, but everyone else also looked at Nanny Qian.Compared with the beginning, now she was like a jumping clown. Nanny Qian had become a complete joke.Although no one laughed, their eyes glinted with mockery.Nanny Qian wasn\u2019t a calm person. Her face quickly blushed at a speed that was visible to the naked eye.She couldn\u2019t understand everything that had happened. But she quickly realized that Su Yaoniang not only had Mammy Mu backing her but that she also had the support of Jin Wang and Consort Jin.How could she possibly get rid of Yaoniang so easily?But Nanny Qian wasn\u2019t thinking about how to get rid of Yaoniang. She was busy thinking of a way to save her own hide.\u201cYucui, escort Nanny Qian to Liuchun Pavilion. The princess can\u2019t afford to have her serving by her side.\u201dNanny Qian\u2019s legs softened and she fell to the ground. She tried to defend herself, \u201cMammy Mu, even if his highness had said that it wasn\u2019t done by Nanny Su, but\u2026\u201dBefore she could finish her sentence, with a glance from Mammy Mu, Yucui came over and slapped her face.\u201cYour courage isn\u2019t small. Who gave you the guts to challenge the master?!\u201dUntil that moment, Yucui was someone that frequently smiled.\u00a0 Now she exhibited majesty and cruelty as someone from the imperial palace.Nanny Qian\u2019s face became red and swollen, and it was easily visible to the naked eye. It was obvious that Yucui\u2019s hand was quite heavy. She muttered in confusion, but still moved towards Nanny Wang \u201c\u2026Mammy, forgive me\u2026 Sister Wang\u2026\u201dNanny Wang instinctively avoided her eyes. Lu\u2019er and Yucui dragged Nanny Qian out.\u201cNanny Wang.\u201d Mammy Mu\u2019s voice suddenly sounded.It was known whether she was frightened by Nanny Qian\u2019s ending or something else, but Nanny Wang was so frightened that her body shook. \u201cMammy?\u201d\u201cFocus on what you are paid to do. Don\u2019t learn from Nanny Qian.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But during this lifetime, that would never happen.Thankfully, Jin Wang had spoken up for her. Otherwise, her current state would\u2019ve been much more pitiful. Yaoniang wasn\u2019t someone who has never seen the wooden plank before, and it was even used on her before. But in this lifetime, she chose her conscience because she didn\u2019t want to become the type of people she once hated.She couldn\u2019t help but think of Jin Wang. Did his highness speak up to protect the consort? Or was it\u2026\u201cNanny Su, your face is a little swollen. Would you like any ice?\u201d asked Luyao.Yao Niang\u00a0automatically\u00a0reached up to touch her face. The incident had happened so fast that she didn\u2019t have the chance to feel any pain at all. But now that it was over, she could feel the heat coming from her face.\u201cIt\u2019s not troublesome anymore.\u201dMammy Mu glanced at her and sighed. \u201cYou were also shocked today. Go back to your room and rest. There\u2019s still Yuyan and Yucui, they can take care of everything.\u201d\u201cBut the little princess\u2026\u201dMammy Mu looked at Nanny Wang and said, \u201cNanny Wang is also here. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dJin Wang came out of the small courtyard with a gloomy expression on his face.Fucheng followed behind him, and he dared not even breathe too\u00a0loudly.\u201cGo investigate. You go too.\u201dThis \u2018you\u2019 was not\u00a0explicitly\u00a0mentioned, but the hidden guard in the shadows immediately left. Fucheng also bowed his head in acknowledgement.Since Side Consort Hu dared to arrange this play, she was sure that no one would be able to trace it back to her. But what kind of person was Jin Wang?As the master of the manor, if Jin Wang wanted to investigate anything, it wouldn\u2019t be hard to find something. It was a matter of whether he wished to or not. This time, Side Consort Hu had crossed the line. Before, she had used the little princess as an excuse and moved her out of Liuchun Pavilion. But who could expect her to be so foolish? It hasn\u2019t even been many days yet, but she\u2019d already forgotten her last lesson.Not to mention this time, she also got Nanny Su entangled in her mess.Fucheng peeked towards Jin Wang\u2019s face. His highness looked very angry. A large part of it must have been because of the involvement of Nanny Su.Fucheng shook his head. Whether this incident\u00a0was done by\u00a0the consort or self-directed by Side Consort Hu, it didn\u2019t matter. His highness had suppressed the matter\u00a0temporarily. But someone would definitely\u00a0be held\u00a0responsible.Nanny Su\u2019s pretty little face\u00a0was red\u00a0and swollen. Fucheng didn\u2019t miss the flash that passed through his highness\u2019s eyes.When they returned to Zhaohui Hall, Fucheng started his investigation immediately.He knew that this matter must\u00a0be dealt\u00a0with, and soon. Even if his highness hadn\u2019t given specific orders, as servants, they must be discerning.Although Fucheng was a eunuch without roots, he had come in contact with countless women throughout the years. Women tend to be narrow-minded creatures.\u00a0If Nanny Su complained or caused a ruckus, his highness would be in worse spirits, and it would be the servants that suffered.Honestly, it would\u00a0mainly\u00a0be himself. Who asked him to be the one that served his highness?Doctor Liu returned to the princess to do another checkup.\u00a0He soon left after confirming that the little princess\u2019s condition was improving from taking the medicine.Mammy Mu was too old to stay up the entire night, so she left Yucui, Yuyan, and Nanny Wang to watch over the little princess. Lu\u2019er and Luyan also didn\u2019t return to rest. Instead, they found themselves a place outside where they could stand guard.\u00a0They were afraid that otherwise there may be some other unexpected events or emergencies.The night was deep, and everything was silent.The light in the room was yellow and dim.Yucui couldn\u2019t help but succumb to her fatigue and soon she was fast asleep. Now, there were only Yuyan and Nanny Wang who remained on watch.Yuyan stood up\u00a0suddenly, which frightened Nanny Wang.\u201cYuyan \u2026\u201dYuyan laughed. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to be so nervous. Nanny Wang, I need to go relieve myself. You stay here. If anything happens, call Yucui. I\u2019ll be back soon.\u201dNanny Wang nodded, and Yuyan left the room.The room was quiet again, so quiet that no sound could\u00a0be heard.\u00a0Nanny Wang, with her heart pounding like drums,\u00a0carefully\u00a0looked towards Yucui, who laid on the couch beneath the window. After observing for a short while, she saw that the other party was in a deep sleep. She got up\u00a0quickly\u00a0and reached over to touch the little princess.The medicine that the little princess drank included an ingredient that induced sleepiness. The princess\u2019s rash caused her to feel super uncomfortable. Whenever she was awake, she would cry until she was hoarse and exhausted. Doctor Liu could only add some sedatives to her medicine.\u00a0The sedatives helped her sleep and prevented her from crying too much and worsening her physical conditionNanny Wang\u00a0gently\u00a0pinched the little princess\u2019s cheek again. When she saw that she did not wake up, she continued to pinch the princess\u2019s cheek with one hand.\u00a0She stretched out a finger from her remaining hand into the princess\u2019s mouth to poke around for something.She prodded around, careful not to miss anything.Nanny Wang couldn\u2019t help but recall the incident from earlier that day\u2013Side Consort Hu had ordered her to\u00a0secretly\u00a0cause the princess to have a rash. Nanny Wang wasn\u2019t stupid. If this matter was not done well, it would be herself that landed in hot water. So she\u00a0deliberately\u00a0instigated Nanny Qian to become more dissatisfied with Nanny Su.\u00a0As soon as something happened, that dumb woman jumped out to make accusations without any extra prodding from her.Although the little princess\u2019s rash\u00a0was\u00a0caused by crabs, it was not from the crab bun found on the plate. It\u00a0was caused by\u00a0the crab meat stuffed into her mouth by Nanny Wang when she started her shift.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Whenever she saw something placed in front of her, she would want to grab it and put it in her mouth. When Nanny Wang held out the crab meat, the little princess immediately opened her mouth in cooperation.But Nanny Wang also knew that the little princess couldn\u2019t chew food at all. She had given the infant some white steamed buns to eat before. Although she was very happy to eat it, she couldn\u2019t swallow it completely. There would always be bits and pieces left in her mouth. One-month-old babies still wouldn\u2019t know how to spit out food. But their abilities were constantly changing. What if the little princess actually had swallowed it? But if she didn\u2019t, it would be in some corner of her mouth, or under her tongue.To put it bluntly, Nanny Wang had a guilty conscience. It was the first time that she\u2019d done something like it. She couldn\u2019t help but think of how miserable she would be if she was discovered.His highness was so wise and shrewd. He said that he wouldn\u2019t be merciful towards the perpetrator. What if he found out that she was the one who did it?The more she thought about it, the more afraid she became. The more afraid she was, the more she couldn\u2019t help but think about it. This was why Nanny Wang couldn\u2019t resist taking a look in the princess\u2019s mouth. If there was nothing to be found, that would be the best, if something was found, she would wipe away all traces.Nanny Wang\u2019s finger continued to probe around the little princess\u2019s mouth. But the princess remained fast asleep because of the sedatives in the medicine.A voice suddenly asked, \u201cNanny Wang, are your hands clean?\u201dNanny Wang automatically replied, \u201cYes, they\u2019re washed. I\u2019ve scrubbed them nice and clean.\u201dShe immediately realized what happened. This wasn\u2019t Yuyan or Yucui\u2019s usual reminder to wash their hands before holding the little princess, but\u2014She turned her head stiffly and saw Yucui standing there, watching her with a smirk.Not far from Yucui, Yuyan stood there with an ugly expression on her face.\u201cI, I\u2026\u201dJin Wang remained in the study room all night.His highness\u2019s anger continued to simmer, and none of the servants dared to say anything. They could only pretend to be mute, for fear of attracting Jin Wang\u2019s anger.A lamp shone in the room. Jin Wang, who sat behind the bookcase, looked gloomy.Fucheng stood in front of the bookcase, cleared his throat and said, \u201c\u2026 the crab bun had appeared under highly suspicious circumstances. Recently, the manor did buy some, but it was only for the consort to eat. Almost everyone in the entire manor knows that the consort had always liked to eat them\u2026\u201d\u201cBut we did find that recently, Side Consort Hu always called Nanny Wang over. She did it under the guise of concern for the little princess. When the rashes had appeared on the princess, someone saw a servant girl named Qin\u2019er enter Nanny Su\u2019s room. She is one of Side Consort Hu\u2019s people. Mammy Mu also had some doubts about Nanny Wang, so with Yuyan and Yucui, they set up a ploy, and Nanny Wang actually fell for it\u2026 \u201d\u201cYou are sure it has nothing to do with Siyi Courtyard?\u201d Jin Wang asked as he tapped his fingers on the table. His face was cloudy as if he was thinking about something.Fucheng nodded. Of course, he could understand his highness\u2019s mind.Honestly, almost everyone saw through Side Consort Hu\u2019s ulterior motive. This woman wasn\u2019t smart in the first place. What if all this was a deliberate ploy created by Consort Jin, to let her rival fall into the pit? It was definitely something that she could pull off. Side Consort Hu had been contesting for power recently, and it had caused her to be very unhappy. It would be normal for Consort Jin to want revenge.Maybe others didn\u2019t know the entire inside story, but Fucheng, who served at Jin Wang\u2019s side, knew and understood everything.Over the recent years, if it hadn\u2019t been for Jin Wang\u2019s constant support and secret protection, Side Consort Hu wouldn\u2019t even know how she died. This was how big the difference was between her and Consort Jin.It was a pity that she didn\u2019t know how to count her blessings. Instead, she kicked up a fuss and caused his highness\u2019s patience to run out. Once he gave up on her, her remaining days would not be pretty.If it wasn\u2019t for the little princess and-Jin Wang suddenly stood up, which interrupted Fucheng\u2019s train of thought. He instinctively stepped forward.\u201cDon\u2019t follow me.\u201dFucheng knew that his highness was going to visit Nanny Su.Yaoniang pondered over a lot of things until she fell asleep.Half asleep, she was awakened by someone lying on top of her.His movements were filled with urgency and his skin felt hot to the touch. Yaoniang wasn\u2019t even completely awake yet but was still muddle-headed.She could feel his hands rubbing against her face. But his hands were too rough and her face was recently slapped. Anger quickly rose in her chestWhen she was slandered and slapped by Side Consort Hu, he didn\u2019t say anything. Now he was sprinkling salt to the wound. She desperately pushed back and tried to keep him away from herself. Unfortunately, there was nowhere to escape.\u201cWhy are you so stupid? You deserve to be slapped\u2026\u201dHe had the audacity to scold her!Yaoniang felt wronged inside. She tried to push him away, but her body wouldn\u2019t listen to her. It had softened from his fondling and was weak all over.No light shone in the room. It was completely dark.Darkness gave people endless courage. In the darkness, Yaoniang\u2019s courage greatly increased.Since she couldn\u2019t see his face, she became more brazen.Fine! If he continued to anger her, she would pack her bags and go home!As he roughly entered her, Yaoniang courageously bit on his shoulder. She tried to cause him pain so he would let go of her.But he acted like it was nothing. Instead, he slid his big palm down her body and pressed himself even closer against her. Then, he suddenly spanked her.The smack rang crisp and clear. The scent of lovemaking filled the air\u201cYou are becoming bold \u2026\u201d He said as he lifted her leg.Yaoniang shuddered and couldn\u2019t help but cry out.She couldn\u2019t remember everything that happened afterwards. But she did have the impression that after a while, he had asked if she wanted to go home. He also asked whether she still thought about that street vendor.Yes, she did want to go home, but what street vendor?What does a street vendor have to do with her!?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

On top of that, a sweet scent lingered in her nostrils.Yaoniang\u2019s head was hurting, her body was in pain, and she felt like she had been run over by a carriage.When she thought about how she had to report for duty soon, she braced herself and got out of bed. After washing up, she headed to the small courtyard where the princess lived. By that time, Yucui was already at her wits\u2019 end.Yesterday, Nanny Wang was taken away by Fucheng and Nanny Qian was sent to Liuchun Pavilion. The little princess had woken up and whined for milk. Yucui wanted to go look for Yaoniang but was stopped by Yuyan. Instead, Yuyan went to the small kitchen and asked for some thin porridge. The two of them worked together to feed the little princess. But porridge was porridge. Milk was milk. Even after drinking it, the princess was still hungry so she kicked up another ruckus.Yaoniang hurried inside to feed the little princess. She also learned that yesterday\u2019s incident was caused by Nanny Wang, who did it under Side Consort Hu\u2019s orders.Yaoniang wasn\u2019t surprised by the fact that Side Consort Hu had orchestrated everything. But she didn\u2019t expect Nanny Wang\u2019s involvement.Ever since she could remember, she had the impression that Nanny Wang was an honest and diligent individual.It appeared to be that Nanny Qian\u2019s actions were from no small effort on Nanny Wang\u2019s part. Yaoniang\u2019s heart was conflicted, and she realized that she still has much to learn.Nanny Wang and Nanny Qian were both gone. Now, she was the only wet nurse serving the little princess. Yaoniang worried about this. If it was before, it wouldn\u2019t bother her one bit, but now, her supply of milk is decreasing. If she only worked a single shift during the day, she could manage to scrape by. But now that she was the only wet nurse remaining, she feared it may not be enough.Yaoniang had hidden the fact that her milk supply was dwindling from those in charge of the small courtyard. After all, she was a wet nurse. If she had no more milk, could she still keep her job? But now, she couldn\u2019t continue to hide it. Just as Yaoniang decided she was going to admit the truth, Yuyan returned from the outside with an ugly expression.From listening to her, Yaoniang understood why her milk supply was decreasing.It turned out that Nanny Wang had added malt-infused water in secret into her meals. When mixed in with her meals, this water was scentless and tasteless.Malt-infused water had the effect of decreasing milk supply. It was also a raw ingredient in lactation suppression medications. Nanny Wang had bribed a woman in the kitchen to put some in her food every day. Fortunately, she didn\u2019t put in too much out of fear of being discovered. But as the ingested amount accumulated over time, her supply of milk gradually dwindled.Yaoniang then asked when did the woman start putting it in her food. Turned out that Nanny Wang had made up her mind to deal with her after Yaoniang had taken the opportunity to calm the princess\u2019s crying.After she heard everything, Yaoniang was shocked.At the same time, she also had a sense of sorrow. During her previous life, she had encountered countless shots fired in the open and many arrows shot in the dark. It wasn\u2019t like she had no experience. But she did not expect that in this lifetime, one after another would target her.She was only a wet nurse.If the situation between her and Jin Wang was known\u2026Yaoniang couldn\u2019t bear to imagine what would happen.The only reason she had managed to live for so long in her past life was Consort Jin\u2019s support. During this life, she has only lived in the manor for less than four months. Yet she has already seen and heard her fair share of schemes and malicious plots.After she reflected, Yaoniang felt even more satisfied with the choice she had made in the beginning. She would stay away from trouble and perform her duties sincerely. When Jin Wang became tired of her, she would return home.But the street vendor-Yaoniang couldn\u2019t help but remember what Jin Wang had said last night. Even after continuous pondering, she still couldn\u2019t understand what he had meant. She even wondered if she had heard it wrong. After all, she wasn\u2019t clear-headed at the time. Maybe she did hear it wrong.But just as she was going to move on to something else, Yaoniang suddenly realized why Jin Wang had asked about the vendor.When her brother-in-law had made up her family background, he made it so that she was married to a poor street vendor. Even worse, the man was short-lived. An accident had happened when he went out to sell goods which caused her to become a young widow.But why did Jin Wang ask about this? Could it be that he was drinking vinegar?*\u201cNanny Su \u2026\u201dYaoniang couldn\u2019t help but shudder. She didn\u2019t dare to tie Jin Wang and jealousy together. It was more likely that Jin Wang had sent someone to investigate her background.Thinking of this, Yaoniang thought that she should find some time to go home.As for the current situation of Yaoniang\u2019s dwindling milk, Mammy Mu specially instructed Yucui to go ask Doctor Liu about it.Doctor Liu said that the malt water may have caused her milk supply to decrease, but it wouldn\u2019t be a big problem if it was properly taken care of. When Yucui returned, she brought back a few packs of medicine and a list.The list contained ingredients that were good for breastfeeding and promoting lactation. With the kitchen preparing food according to the list, Yaoniang could be nursed back to optimal health.But it would take time for her to return to normal, and the little princess couldn\u2019t go without food. When Mammy Mu was about to have Yuyan go to Liuchun Pavilion and ask for Nanny Qian, people from Siyi Courtyard arrived.Consort Jin had dispatched Zi Yan along with two newly-hired wet nurses to the small courtyard.One had to admit that the consort did things swiftly and resolutely. Mammy Mu didn\u2019t ask anything but simply accepted the two of them.Mammy Mu doesn\u2019t completely trust Consort Jin, but Consort Jin was a very intelligent woman. Since she took the initiative to send someone to the door, it indicated that she wasn\u2019t willing to harm the little princess. Ensuring that everything went smoothly was tantamount to her reputation. Since she had sent the two nurses, it was the same as giving others something to hold against her if something bad happened.Mammy Mu was also not willing to ignore Consort Jin\u2019s considerate gestures. As far as she was concerned, as long as it wasn\u2019t harmful to the little princess, she could ignore it. This was why Yaoniang and Cuizhu could come and work in the small courtyard without any trouble. When the little princess had the rash, Mammy Mu and Jin Wang intuitively believed that Side Consort Hu self-directed and self-acted everything. Their suspicion for Consort Jin was not great at all.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Jin Wang\u2019s attitude was also understood by everyone.Consort Jin\u2019s status and position within the manor were still supreme. No one could undermine it, not even the favoured Side Consort Hu or the little princess. After both Nanny Wang and Nanny Qian were driven away, only Nanny Su remained. Those observant servants all understood this matter clearly.Ever since Side Consort Hu entered the manor, Consort Jin\u2019s position had become shaky. But now it was as solid as a rock once more.Some fence-sitters, who waited to watch the wind\u2019s direction,\u00a0 changed their attitudes. The smarter ones still treated Side Consort Hu with respect as usual, but their actions may not always match their words. Respect wasn\u2019t about showing intimacy but keeping a sense of distance. As for those who weren\u2019t smart, it was inevitable that they would step on those who were drowning. As a result, the treatment that servants from Liuchun Pavilion received, suffered. They would also quarrel often and get in conflict with other servants.Many thought that Side Consort Hu would try to regain favour and power, but surprisingly, she remained quiet and didn\u2019t stir up any troubles.Not only that, but Consort Jin also began to settle accounts with Side Consort Hu.There were rules in the manor about the number of servants one could have, depending on their status and identity. For example, the consort could have four first-class maids, eight second-class maids, and some other older female servants. According to the regulations, side consorts were inferior and treated as such. But Side Consort Hu relied on Jin Wang\u2019s favour and the fact that she was pregnant in the past. Not only does her servants exceed the usual standards, but she also received extra indulgence in other matters. This time, Consort Jin was determined to settle the score.Over half of the people in Liuchun Pavilion were gone after a single night. Many of them were confidants of Side Consort Hu. When Consort Jin sent someone to settle the account that day, the entire Liuchun Pavilion cried and wailed. Even the people in the small courtyard became alarmed.Side Consort Hu naturally couldn\u2019t bear it this time. But it was a pity that she still couldn\u2019t see Jin Wang despite going to Zhaohui Hall several times.Jin Wang\u2019s attitude was very clear.As a result, the manor\u2019s rear courtyard entered a rare period of peace, with Consort Jin resuming dominance.In this regard, Consort Jin was only too happy to see it happen. She could finally breathe out a sigh of relief and hold her head high.Whether one wanted to or not, accepted it or not, in this manor, only by following Jin Wang\u2019s will could one live a smooth life. In the past, it wasn\u2019t that Consort Jin didn\u2019t understand this concept. But it was a pity that she was too proud and unruly. Even if she acted obedient on the surface, she still harboured disdain in her heart.But this pride was finally crushed into powder by the constant wear and tear of reality. When Jin Wang took the initiative to pass the knife, Consort Jin took it without hesitation.She could only surrender. She had no choice but to give in, especially since there were plenty of reasons that compelled her to yield.Yaoniang had suffered a lot of grievances, and now she has to recuperate and take care of her body.When she saw that the two new wet nurses were doing a good job, Mammy Mu had Yaoniang relax. Her only duties currently were to guide the new nannies on how to properly serve the little princess.Once the two new nannies could finally work on their own, Yaoniang went to Mammy Mu to ask for leave.She wanted to go home.Mammy Mu approved it and sent instructions for a carriage to take Yaoniang home.While the sky was still dark outside Yaoniang got up and prepared.She had a lot of things that she wanted to bring back. Some were rewarded by Mammy Mu, while others were conferred by Consort Jin. Side Consort Hu knew that this was the first time for her to return home ever since she entered the manor, so she also joined in the fun and sent some stuff over.But there was no movement at all from Jin Wang\u2019s side.Of course, this was only on the surface. Although it appeared that Jin Wang no longer came to the small courtyard, the reality was that he would always come at night. Who knew what was bothering him recently. He used to arrive much earlier in the evening, but now, he wouldn\u2019t be here until midnight. As a result, Yaoniang would usually sleep until midnight. Then, she would be rudely awakened by the pressure of someone lying on top of her.This man also wouldn\u2019t say anything. He would simply do it and toss her throughout the night. When Yaoniang woke up the next morning, not even a sliver of his shadow could be found.Yaoniang felt like she had returned to her previous life. This was how Jin Wang was in her past life.But she refused to continue to delve into the topic. She had never been successful at guessing Jin Wang\u2019s incomprehensible heart.Yaoniang carried her luggage, informed Mammy Mu, then departed from the small courtyard.She reached the manor\u2019s side entrance. There, a black carriage with blue curtains waited for her. In the carriage sat a familiar person. It was Zhou Sheng.When he saw Yaoniang arriving with a heavy bag in her hand, Zhou Sheng jumped out of the carriage. He quickly reached her.Yaoniang was a little surprised. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect it to be Brother Zhou.\u201dZhou Sheng smiled and scratched the back of his head. \u201cI also happened to be going home, so I took this job on purpose.\u201dHe didn\u2019t mention that to take on this job, he had to treat his roommates to a drink. Despite his attempts to cover up, everyone soon learned who Zhou Sheng wanted to woo. It was Nanny Su who served alongside the little princess.Everyone said that Zhou Sheng was going to make it big. Although Nanny Su was a widow and had a child, she was someone who frequently showed her face in front of the masters of the manor. With the current situation, it was almost certain that she would be the personal nanny of the little princess in the future. If Zhou Sheng could really marry Nanny Su, his future would be set.Zhou Sheng was too lazy to bother with all this. His thought process was very simple. He had finally found this opportunity to be alone with Yaoniang.He rushed to help Yaoniang with her baggage then he took it to the back of the carriage and set it down. He came back and placed a wooden step in front of Yao Niang.\u201cNanny Su, hop on the carriage.\u201dYao Niang was a little abashed by the other person\u2019s considerate actions.\u201cThank you, Brother Zhou.\u201d\u201cNo need for thanks. Let\u2019s get in the carriage. If we set off early and go faster on the road, we can probably get there by evening.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He couldn\u2019t understand what his highness was thinking.Nanny Su had gone home. His highness had already known about it for days in advance. If he wasn\u2019t willing for her to leave, he should have expressed it. Instead, he remained sullen and ordered people to report on the small courtyard\u2019s affairs every day.He knew that both Consort Jin and Side Consort Hu had bestowed some gifts. To curry favour with the consort, Concubine Feng, Lady Li and Lady Tao had also conferred some rewards.Besides the ladies of the rear courtyard, Mammy Mu also granted some things to Yaoniang.Jin Wang was the master of the manor. It was one thing for him not to know about Yaoniang returning home, but he should have also bestowed some gifts since he knew. Yaoniang was a hard worker and also suffered from being wronged by others. Moreover, she also shared a special relationship with Jin Wang.But Jin Wang didn\u2019t. Instead, he asked for reports about what gifts Yaoniang was given even though he himself did not give anything to YaoniangBased on Fucheng\u2019s many years of experience, his highness was sulking and irritated.But it wasn\u2019t the first time for Jin Wang and Yaoniang to be at loggerheads. It could be seen from how he would only visit the small courtyard late at night. Sometimes he would even decide not to go, only to change his mind later and arrive far later into the evening than usualFucheng thought what was the point? If he wished to go somewhere, just go. Why bother having an internal conflict over this type of matter?But Fucheng dared not say this out loud. He still wanted to live for some more years.The servants below had already come to report that Nanny Su was packed up and prepared to leave the manor. Jin Wang obviously wanted to go see her off, but he still hesitated and didn\u2019t make a move. Until Yaoniang had almost reached the gate, did he make up an excuse to go. Then when he reached the manor\u2019s side gate, he happened to stumble on this scene.Fucheng looked at the young driver who was talking to Nanny Su. He concluded that the man was smiling abnormally.Did this young man have ideas about Nanny Su?This thought excited Fucheng. When he peered at Jin Wang\u2019s face, it had indeed become colder and his expression was chilling to the core.Fucheng couldn\u2019t help but compare the two men. If he was Nanny Su, he would rather look at the smiling face than the cold face.Humph!He seemed to have heard a cold snort. Fucheng turned around and saw Jin Wang walking away.The pair of people over there still hasn\u2019t even noticed anything.Yaoniang got in the carriage, and Zhou Sheng drove away from the side entrance of the prince\u2019s manor.He had good driving skills. The carriage ran fast and steady. Yaoniang couldn\u2019t even feel any jolts while sitting inside.Actually, it was also because the manor had good quality carriages. After Mammy Mu had spoken, Zhou Sheng deliberately picked one of the good carriages. The type which was specially prepared for the masters to use. These carriages were wide and large. There were also couches inside, which made the carriages comfortable to sit in.Yaoniang looked around curiously. Only after she asked about it did she learn that it was a carriage designed for the masters of the prince\u2019s manor.\u201cWill this cause trouble for Brother Zhou?\u201d Yaoniang had always been a responsible person. She would feel bad if someone got in trouble because of her.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. The master and the mistresses of the manor rarely go out. These carriages are very well taken care of, it would be a pity for them to be left idle from lack of use,\u201d said Zhou Sheng carelessly.After a pause, he continued, \u201cTo be honest, these carriages are often borrowed by the other favoured servants in the manor. Those who work in the horse and carriage department also turn a blind eye to it to prevent themselves from offending anyone. Nanny Su, Mammy Mu had personally ordered a carriage for you, so there\u2019s nothing anyone can say about it. \u201cHearing this, Yaoniang was relieved.It seemed that Zhou Sheng travelled on this road often. He didn\u2019t even stop to take a break but simply continued down the road.The weather was sweltering. To reduce the heat, Yaoniang opened the carriage door to allow for better air circulation.Zhou Sheng was very happy to see this because now he could talk with her. He was more than willing to speak with Yaoniang. They talked with each other the entire trip and time flew by very quickly. By the end of the trip, they had a very good understanding of each other.At the very least, Yaoniang knew about Zhou Sheng\u2019s hometown and some of his family\u2019s situation. Zhou Sheng also learned more about Yaoniang\u2019s history. Yaoniang still used the same excuse where her ex-husband was a vendor. An accident had happened when he went out to sell goods. Then he passed away, leaving behind a pregnant wife.\u201cNanny Su, there\u2019s no need to be devastated. Life goes on. See, isn\u2019t everything going well now?\u201d Zhou Sheng wasn\u2019t very good at coaxing others and his words of comfort were very dry.When Yaoniang looked at him, she smiled a little. \u201cThank you, Brother Zhou, for your concern. I\u2019m fine now. I\u2019m happy to work in the prince\u2019s manor to earn more money. Then, I will go home and raise Xiaobao.\u201dZhou Sheng, who was still driving the carriage, looked at her from the corner of his eyes. He endured, but he simply couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cNanny Su, you don\u2019t plan on marrying again?\u201dDuring the Dagan dynasty, widows often remarried, especially in Jinzhou. Because of its location which was near the borders, the local customs were relatively more open.When she heard this, Yaoniang couldn\u2019t help but be stunned. She lowered her head. \u201cAs a woman with a dead husband and a young child, which man would be willing to marry me?\u201dZhou Sheng wished to express he was.Unfortunately, he didn\u2019t dare to.These past few days, like a possessed man, he dreamed of her every night. All he wanted was to rush up to her and tell her that he wanted to marry her. But when the actual person sat in front of him with her fair and flawless face, he became scared.Zhou Sheng\u2019s entire body was tense and his heart was pounding like crazy. He suppressed his nervousness and squeezed out some words of praise to Yaoniang.It was probably the first time for him to compliment someone, so he wasn\u2019t very skilled. But he still managed to amuse Yaoniang.\u201cBrother Zhou, thank you very much.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Yaoniang could see that Zhou Sheng was trying to comfort her and encourage her. She could tell that the young man in front of her was a kind person.At noon, Zhou Sheng parked the carriage by a teahouse that stood on the side of the road.It seemed that he was very familiar with the place and had been here many times in the past. Zhou Sheng led Yaoniang into the teahouse.The teahouse was very simple and only served some basic tea and steamed buns.Zhou Sheng was a little annoyed. Everything was going according to schedule, but when noontime approached, he was afraid that Nanny Su would be hungry. He chose to stop here for a lunch break, but he realized that he had forgotten that the food here was not delicious.Yaoniang smiled and took out a cloth bag from the baggage that she carried with her. Inside were some meat buns wrapped in oil paper.\u201cThese were made by the ladies in the kitchen. But it was inconvenient to eat it on the road.\u201d\u201cYou should eat them. I\u2019ll just eat some steamed buns,\u201d refused Zhou Sheng.\u201cHow can one person finish all this by themselves? The weather is hot, and they will go bad after a while. Brother Zhou, there\u2019s no need to be so courteous.\u201dThe two then ordered two bowls of tea. Together, they ate the meat buns with the tea.Zhou Sheng felt like he was drenched in sweetness as he enjoyed his meal and that Yaoniang was even more pleasing to the eye.After they finished the meat buns, they drank some tea. Then they found a place to wash their hands.In such a desolate place, Zhou Sheng was afraid that Yaoniang would encounter a mishap, so he stood guard outside the latrine.Yaoniang went in then came out after a while with her face still blushing. This was the first time for her to go to the washroom with a grown man standing guard outside.There was a large tank of water outside the teahouse entrance. A water basin and a ladle sat next to it. They were used for washing hands.Yaoniang went to wash her hands. Zhou Sheng diligently ladled out a scoop of water to help her wash.\u201cBrother Zhou, I must be troubling you. Taking me with you must be a bothersome\u201d\u201cHow could\u2026\u201dAs he was speaking, a carriage drove by, then stopped in the open space in front of the teahouse.Four people got out of the carriage. The first person was a young man, while the other three were tanned and burly men. The young man was ordinary in appearance and dressed inconspicuously, but people could tell that he was the leader of the group at first glance.\u201cYoung master, besides the small teahouse, there\u2019s nothing here.\u201dThe young man, who was addressed as a young master, had an expression full of disdain and impatience. \u201cWhat can I eat in a place like this\u2026?\u201dNoticing someone coming, Yaoniang automatically leaned to the side and wiped her hands on her skirt to dry.\u201cBrother Zhou, let\u2019s go now.\u201dZhou Sheng nodded. He decided not to bother with washing his hands, but to take Yaoniang and leave.They passed by the four men but were suddenly stopped from behind.\u201cHey! The young lady in the front!\u201dYaoniang lowered her head and acted like she didn\u2019t hear anything. She wanted to continue forward but was not quick enough. She was stopped by a large man standing in her way.\u201cI\u2019m talking to you! Didn\u2019t you hear anything?\u201d The young master stared at Yaoniang\u2019s face without blinking. He didn\u2019t expect there to be such a stunning person in such a desolate place.The young master was the only son of a rich merchant. As the only son in all three generations of his family, he was spoiled rotten and lived lawlessly. Coupled with the fact that his family was considered rich where he lived, the young man became a frequent visitor of brothels. At his current young age, his body was already drained of vitality.He was no longer a child but he still didn\u2019t know anything besides how to start fights. The merchant hardened his heart, made up his mind, and drove his son out to sell goods. He wanted to make his son suffer so that he would understand the hardships of life, lest he causes the family business to fall to ruin.The young master was usually pampered and was accustomed to a life of luxury. When has he ever experienced so much hardship? But this was beside the point. The key point was that now he doesn\u2019t have the chance to visit brothels and accompany beauties.The group of men have been on the road for the past two days. Besides the dust on the road, there were only trees. Yes, they did occasionally also see people, but there were only rough men. It wasn\u2019t easy to encounter such a pretty flower. No wonder the young master couldn\u2019t tear his eyes away.As an experienced veteran, he naturally knew what type of woman was the most delicious. He loved mature women, not those young unmarried virgins. The older women understood how to have fun, but the young girls were like dead fish once they laid down on a couch.The number of women he has had was unknown, but Yaoniang was still a peerless stunner in his eyes. Her clothes were conservative and her entire body was tightly wrapped, but he could still see her pert butt and full swaying tits when she walked. It was obvious that she was well taken care of by a man.The young master licked his lips as he rubbed his chin and roamed his eyes up and down Yaoniang. When the other three men who stood beside him saw this, they all smiled bitterly but did nothing to stop him.Yaoniang had the illusion that she was stripped bare by his gaze. She couldn\u2019t help but stretch out her hands to cover her chest and step to the side to hide. Zhou Sheng stepped forward and stood in front of her.\u201cI wonder why this young man is blocking our way?\u201dThe young master raised his head and glanced at Zhou Sheng. \u201cMove aside! Don\u2019t hinder this young master\u2019s way!\u201dHe stretched out his hand towards Zhou Sheng and pushed him. Zhou Sheng was caught off guard by his shove and staggered to the side.\u201cBrother Zhou \u2026\u201d Yaoniang hurried over to help him.The young man approached Yaoniang to drag her away as he said, \u201cLook at you, a sweet young couple. But so what? This young master doesn\u2019t care, I happen to love to plow fields that have already been plowed.\u201d Zhou Sheng stood in his way to guard against him. Impatient, the young man scolded, \u201cAre the three of you dead? Why aren\u2019t you helping?!\u201dAlthough the three followers looked helpless, they approached Zhou Sheng without hesitation. It was not the first time for them to do such a thing.Zhou Sheng had a bad feeling in his heart. He tried to signal with his eyes to Yaoniang so she would run away. \u201cWhere are you people from? Do you know which household we are from?\u201d\u201cPffft! Who cares which household you are from? Get out of my way!\u201dAs he finished his words, he swung his fist towards Zhou Sheng. At this point, Zhou Sheng couldn\u2019t be bothered to reason with him any longer. He pushed the people away and shouted to Yaoniang, \u201cYaoniang, hurry and run!\u201d\u201cBrother Zhou \u2026\u201dYaoniang was so anxious that she started to cry. She ran a few steps but suddenly turned around and ran back again.\u201cI won\u2019t run away!\u201d Her cheeks flushed red, and she was furious. \u201cBlind your dog\u2019s eyes. We are from Jin Wang Mansion. Offending those from Jin Wang Mansion here in Jinzhou, are you tired of living?! \u201cShe tried her best to imitate Side Consort Hu\u2019s domineering style. But with her soft body and petite face, it would be a wonder for people to take her seriously.But the men did pause their movements and looked towards her.\u201cJin Wang Mansion? You two?\u201d The young master squinted his eyes as if he had heard a joke.Yaoniang looked around anxiously, and suddenly saw a carriage parked in the woods not far away.\u201cWe came out in a carriage from the prince\u2019s manor!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The young master was scared away and repeatedly said that everything was just a misunderstanding. The group of people had gone to the teahouse to take a short break, but now they don\u2019t dare to rest anymore. They couldn\u2019t be quicker in leaving, it was as if there was a tiger on their heels.Zhou Sheng blushed and he glanced at Yaoniang who was sitting next to him. \u201cNanny Su, you are great at remaining calm under pressure. I was so scared.\u201d\u201cHow could that be? It was just because Brother Zhou was afraid that I would be hurt.\u201dHonestly, Yaoniang was actually very moved. Under those circumstances, Zhou Sheng did not choose to run away on his own, but he remained behind to keep those men away from her. Besides the father and son of the Su family and her brother-in-law, Yao Cheng, Yaoniang had come in contact with very few men in her life. Su Xiucai was a conservative and inflexible man. Su Yucheng was a lazy man who only cared about satisfying his stomach. Her brother-in-law, Yao Cheng, acted more like Yaoniang\u2019s real brother.Then there was Jin Wang, but Jin Wang couldn\u2019t be counted as an ordinary person. Zhou Sheng could be regarded as the first unrelated man to be close to Yaoniang.\u201cIt was me that was stupid. I thought it would be too eye-catching to park the carriage by the main road, so I parked it by the forest out of sight. If I had parked the carriage by the road, where everyone could see, even if they ate a bear\u2019s heart and a leopard\u2019s gall, they wouldn\u2019t dare to do anything. This must have frightened Nanny Su.\u201dWith the Jin Wang Mansion emblem on the carriage, it was the same as a free pass. In Jinzhou, there was nowhere that it couldn\u2019t go.\u201cBrother Zhou is considerate, but no one could have expected this to happen\u2026\u201dThe two continued to talk aboard their carriage. In the woods to the back of the teahouse, a man in black, who sat upon a large horse, suddenly whistled. This whistle sounded like a bird\u2019s cry and it wasn\u2019t noticeable by other people. Before one could even blink, a black hawk flew down from the sky and landed on his shoulder.The man took out a bamboo tube. He poured out a special thin charcoal pencil and a small roll of paper from the bamboo tube.As he sat on the horse, with the pencil in one hand and the small roll of paper in the other, he wrote: harassed by a local despot on the road, the coachman saved the beauty, Nanny Su is safe.He paused and considered whether he should add another sentence to report that the evil people have fled because they heard his highness\u2019s name. After he thought about it, he decided not to add it because the paper was limited and it would be better to be concise. Then, he put the small roll of paper into a silver tube, tied it to the black hawk\u2019s talon and released it into the sky.After he finished all this, he braced himself and started to chase after Yaoniang and Zhou Sheng.Before night fell, the two finally arrived in Linyun County.The carriage stopped in front of Yaoniang\u2019s house and she felt a rush of nervousness and homesickness. Zhou Sheng took the initiative to get out of the carriage and knock on the door. \u201cHello? Is there anyone home?\u201dAfter a while, the sound of footsteps came from the inside and the door was opened.It was Yao Cheng.When he saw Yaoniang getting down from the carriage, Yao Cheng was a little surprised. \u201cYaoniang, you are back!\u201dAs he greeted her, he wanted to turn his head back inside and announce her arrival, but he soon changed his mind for some reason. \u201cQuickly, come inside. We\u2019ll talk once you are inside.\u201dYaoniang walked into the house, and Zhou Sheng was also dragged inside by Yao Cheng.Yao Cheng said that Zhou Sheng had worked hard during this trip. He also urged him to eat a meal before leaving. Zhou Sheng refused several times before he finally agreed. He wasn\u2019t desperate for a meal with the Yao family, but he didn\u2019t want to miss any chance to be together with Yaoniang.As soon as Yaoniang walked inside, Huiniang, who heard her movements, rushed up and hugged her in her arms.\u201cYou stinky brat, you haven\u2019t come back for such a long time!\u201dTears streamed down Huiniang\u2019s face as she scolded her and Yaoniang sobbed too. As soon as the men entered, they saw the two women hugging and crying together. Yao Cheng instinctively looked over and made eye contact with Zhou Sheng. When he saw that Zhou Sheng had such a tacit understanding as himself, Yao Cheng looked over at his younger sister-in-law again. Then back at Zhou Sheng. Yao Cheng couldn\u2019t help but have some thoughts.Yaoniang had thought that upon her return this time, Mrs. Li would say some sour words and make some snide remarks. But contrary to her expectations, the Mrs. Li that she knew had changed from her previous attitude and instead, treated her very warmly.Not only to Yaoniang but also to Zhou Sheng. Mrs. Li expressed an unusual enthusiasm that made people feel uncomfortable. She even asked Yao Cheng to go out to buy some food and drinks, then come back and entertain Zhou Sheng. After all, as a visitor, he was a guest and should be treated as such.Yao Cheng obeyed. After he finished buying some food and wine, he returned. It was perfect timing because Yaoniang and Huiniang had also just finished preparing dinner. Ordinary citizens didn\u2019t have any rules about separating tables for masters and servants. With everyone sitting together at the same table, it was very lively.But one person was missing from the dinner table- Yan\u2019er.Yaoniang didn\u2019t know what had happened to the Yao family recently. She cared even less about that person. After all, a large part of her current circumstances was caused by Yan\u2019er. It was already good that she wasn\u2019t taking revenge, how could she bother to care for the other party?During dinner, Mrs. Li repeatedly asked Zhou Sheng about himself.The questions were very detailed. They included: where are you from, what is your family like, and what do you do for a living. Yaoniang was puzzled about why Mrs. Li was so interrogative, but Yao Cheng and his wife understood. The couple interrupted Mrs. Li several times, which dampened her spirits. But her mood soon improved when she thought of how she already got a good grasp of Zhou Sheng\u2019s general situation.After dinner, Yao Cheng invited Zhou Sheng to stay for the night. He didn\u2019t refuse the offer. After all, everyone knew that it wasn\u2019t safe to travel in the dark.After organizing a room for Zhou Sheng, Yao Cheng went to look for Yaoniang.Yaoniang was holding Xiaobao in her arms and she was reluctant to place him down. At his current age of six months old, babies were simply too cute.His small hands were chubby, and his tiny arms and calves were like lotus roots. They tempted people to take a bite. Xiaobao was not like the little princess, who had ice in her room to reduce the heat. It was already very good for ordinary people to have a basin of water in the room, so Xiaobao wore little clothes. With a big red dudou wrapped around his small body, he looked even more cherubic.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 70": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Jin Wang Dotes on His ConcubineCH 47.2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter these past few days of recuperation, Yaoniang\u2019s milk supply gradually increased again. Her milk for the day had accumulated and she couldn\u2019t wait to feed her son. So as soon as Xiaobao rubbed his cheeks against her breasts, she bundled up her son and returned to her room to feed him.Xiaobao seemed to recognize her as his mother, and didn\u2019t resist her but suckled her breasts. The age of six months old is when babies\u2019 appetites become bigger. Yaoniang watched as her son drank her milk and she felt sweet inside.Suddenly, Yaoniang realized some similarities between her baby\u2019s small face and that man\u2019s.She looked closer and found that Xiaobao\u2019s eye shape was very similar to Jin Wang\u2019s. They both had narrow but long eyes. But since Xiaobao was still young, so it wasn\u2019t as obvious. But if someone took a closer look, they could see the resemblance.Yaoniang\u2019s eyes were shaped differently. She had apricot eyes, which were round with slightly curved edges, and gave her a gentle and charming look.In other words, did Xiaobao look like his father?When she thought of this, Yaoniang couldn\u2019t help but feel disgusted in her heartShe was reluctant to recall her humiliating past. To be honest, Yaoniang hadn\u2019t even seen the face of the evil man who had raped her.Yaoniang refused to think about it any longer. She changed the side that Xiaobao ate from, and he soon fell asleep after he ate his fill.She caressed her son\u2019s small head with melancholy. No matter how long she spent gazing at him, it wasn\u2019t enough. Xiaobao had grown older and his appearance had slightly changed, but their blood ties could never be erased.A knock sounded from the door, followed by Huiniang\u2019s voice. \u201cYaoyao.\u201dYaoniang hurriedly put Xiaobao on the bed and got up to open the door.She saw that Yao Cheng was also standing outside, and she quickly invited the two of them to come in.Yaoniang had thoughts on her mind and so did Yao Cheng.Yao Cheng and Huiniang both opened their mouths to ask about how Jin Wang Mansion had sent someone to inquire about the details of Yaoniang\u2019s background.After a while, Yao Cheng added, \u201cYaoniang, there\u2019s no need to be scared. From my knowledge, if the master wanted to hire you, they would definitely send someone to conduct a background check. After all, the little princess is different from us and is a very important person. Naturally, the process of hiring the nannies around her couldn\u2019t be taken lightly. \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for what had happened, Yao Cheng\u2019s analysis would make sense. But because of the ambiguous relationship that Yaoniang had with Jin Wang, she had a feeling that it wasn\u2019t so simple.But if someone asked her to explain how complicated it was, she wouldn\u2019t be able to say it. She could only set the matter aside for the time being.\u201cBrother-in-law, would people believe the backstory that you fabricated? Will Jin Wang Manor send someone to investigate whether I had a child out of wedlock?\u201dYao Cheng looked at her with a puzzled expression on his face. \u201cWhy would Jin Wang Manor send someone down to inquire about such trivial matters? Isn\u2019t it just a background check to see if you are clean? Your father is a *Xiucai and your brother-in-law works in the local government office. If a daughter of such a family is considered to have an unclean background, then I honestly don\u2019t know what kind of people would be clean. \u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not\u2026\u201d Yaoniang immediately wanted to add something, but then she stopped herself. If she said too much, she may end up saying something she shouldn\u2019t. She didn\u2019t want her sister and brother-in-law to know that despite signing up to be a wet nurse, she ended up getting involved with the child\u2019s father. If people found out, she would be too embarrassed to go out. After all, she was a daughter raised in an upright family.In her previous life, her sister and brother-in-law had found out, but what was done couldn\u2019t be undone.Huiniang noticed her sister\u2019s hesitation and was amused. \u201cOkay, okay, I just knew you would be worried about this. Did you think that your sister and brother-in-law would remain idle while you were gone?\u201dYaoniang cast her a doubtful look. Huiniang continued with a smile: \u201cAfter you had left, I went back home and told Father, Mother and Brother Zhu to say to the outsiders that you got married. Your husband is a street vendor but because his family wasn\u2019t from the local area, you guys got married in a hurry. \u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s impossible for the neighbours to be unaware that a marriage took place.\u201dHuiniang grinned. \u201cI asked them to say that you got married from the Yao family.\u201d After all, the eldest daughter-in-law of the Su family always picked on Yaoniang, and the neighbours of the Su family all knew. Before Huiniang had gone home to pick up Yaoniang to live with her at the Yao family, there was a huge commotion. Only after the disturbance was resolved did Yaoniang leave with her.Yaoniang was stupefied.Huiniang continued, \u201cAs for the neighbours on the Yao family side, I went out and gave them some wedding candies a while ago. Think of it as amassing a good fortune for you. Naturally, I told them that the wedding was held at the Su family. Hehe. No need to thank me.\u201dHuiniang was very clever. No one would bother to inquire more. The neighbours of the Yao family wouldn\u2019t go to the neighbours of the Su family to discuss Yaoniang\u2019s marriage. Especially since the two families lived quite far away from each other, almost on opposite sides of the county.As she looked at her slightly haggard sister under the dim light, Yaoniang\u2019s eyes couldn\u2019t help but turn red. She took a hold of Huiniang\u2019s hand. \u201cSister\u2013\u201c\u201cThat\u2019s enough. You are already a mother, but you still have the temper of a little girl.\u201d Huiniang stroked Yaoniang\u2019s cheek as she said so. Despite her words, her eyes couldn\u2019t help but redden.This was all that she could do for her misfortunate sister. At least when Yaoniang returns home, she wouldn\u2019t be forced to leave with Xiaobao, but would still be presentable in front of the masses.Yaoniang sniffed and went to the cabinet to take out her luggage.\u201cThe masters of the house bestowed some clothes, fabric and jewelry \u2026\u201d Yaoniang took the things out of her bag one by one. \u201cThe clothes and jewelry are for you. The fabric should be kept to make clothes for Ming\u2019er, Hong\u2019er and brother-in-law. \u201c\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of giving all this to us? You keep it. Since they had bestowed it to you, you should keep it. You can keep it for Xiaobao to wear in the future, or you can sell it for some money.\u201d\u201cSister, if you and brother-in-law do this, I would be too ashamed to face you. I have caused you so much trouble, and you guys are also taking care of Xiaobao \u2026\u201dOnce these words were said, it was pointless to continue to protest. Continuing would only cause more pain. Huiniang could only interrupt her siser, console her, and accept the things that Yaoniang brought back.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He is honest and works in the prince\u2019s manor. He is also not too old.\u201dYan\u2019er peeked through a slit in the window but didn\u2019t manage to see Zhou Sheng. She couldn\u2019t help but whisper, \u201cHow successful can he be? He\u2019s just a servant who works for his master.\u201dMrs. Li slapped her thigh. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with working as a servant? It also depends on who the masters are! Can the hired workers of small landlords compare with the servants of the prince\u2019s manor?! Besides, Zhou Sheng is only how old this year? Who can say for sure what his future will be like? Do you think of yourself as a phoenix or the Queen Mother of the West? If you miss this chance, you will have to go to the countryside to marry an old widower and become a stepmother!\u201dYan\u2019er was also unwilling to become a stepmother. She wrinkled her face and glanced at her mother hesitantly. \u201cIt has to be him?\u201dMrs. Li nodded her head vigorously. \u201cYes, it does! I\u2019ll try to keep him for another day, and then we can ask your brother to help act as a matchmaker.\u201d\u201cThat Yaoniang won\u2019t mess things up right?\u201d Yan\u2019er rolled her eyes at the thought of her.\u201cSee if she dares!\u201d Mrs. Li slapped her thigh again. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t forget that Xiaobao is still living at our house.\u201dYan\u2019er nodded and snuggled up to Mrs. Li. \u201cMother, Yaoniang seems to have struck it big. This time she brought back a lot of good things. The things from the prince\u2019s manor are definitely not bad. You must help me ask for some so that I can use it as a part of my dowry.\u201dIf she hadn\u2019t mentioned this, Mrs. Li would have forgotten about it. When Yaoniang came inside, she did see her carrying two large bags, but at that time Zhou Sheng was next to her. She was too embarrassed to ask Yaoniang for the things in front of an outsider.But in front of her daughter, she would never expose her thoughts. She used her finger to poke her daughter\u2019s forehead. \u201cYou greedy and shallow little girl. If you want a dowry, you have to get married first!\u201dWith that said, she left the West Chamber and passed by the East Chamber. She saw the lights from inside and hesitated. She resisted the urge to go over to eavesdrop and walked away.A faint glimmer of light shone from the horizon as dawn broke.Lin Yun County was like a giant beast that gradually woke up from a deep slumber. The streets and alleys gradually became rowdy with voices.It was still and quiet in the Yao Family neighbourhood. From time to time, one could hear the creak of a door, followed by the sound of wooden wheels running over the cobbled streets. A garbage cart comes by every morning and goes from door to door to collect trash.Yaoniang had woken up a long time ago, but she didn\u2019t want to get out of bed. Lying next to her was Xiaobao who was sound asleep.There was a faint sound of rustling from sweeping the yard outside. Yaoiang kissed her son on the head and got up to get dressed. When she was almost set, she heard the sound of movement from outside.A noise sounded and it was accompanied by Yao Cheng\u2019s voice. Yaoniang pushed open the door and went out.Huiniang was also up and was making the bed.Ming\u2019er lived in the main room along with Mrs. Li, while Hong\u2019er still lived with his parents.At this moment, Hong\u2019er hadn\u2019t woken up yet and was sleeping in his own small crib. Lying under the winder, the crib was surrounded by wooden railings.Huiniang turned and said to her sister, \u201cIs Xiaobao awake yet? Put him here before he wakes up. So even if we happen to turn our backs on the child, he won\u2019t fall off the bed when he wakes up.\u201dBabies at the age of six months old were naughty. They would roll off the bed when they awakened. If there were no railings, who knew what would happen. Huiniang had to watch over three children by herself. Although Mrs. Li occasionally watches over Ming\u2019er, her eldest son, Yan\u2019er and she were both lazy people who didn\u2019t want to do anything. Despite needing to watch over the children, Huiniang also had to do all the housework. She had no choice but to find a carpenter to make such a bed. When she was too busy, she would put Hong\u2019er and Xiaobao in the bed.When she saw the bed, Yaoniang\u2019s heart ached. She forced back her sorrow and nodded. She returned to her room and carried Xiaobao out, then placed him beside Hong\u2019er.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. When other families are too busy, they would also leave their children like this.\u201d Huiniang comforted her sister when she saw that Yaoniang was troubled.Yaoniang nodded and said, \u201cSister, I asked you to hire someone or buy a servant girl to help with the housework. Why didn\u2019t you do it?\u201dHuiniang sighed. \u201cDo you think that buying a servant girl is simply a matter of money? It\u2019s not easy to encounter a servant girl who is old enough to know how to take care of children. Buying a servant girl who is too young is the same as gaining another daughter. Your brother-in-law and I can\u2019t bear to order a young girl to do the work. There\u2019s even less need to mention hiring people to come and help. It\u2019s hard to find a trustworthy person to work for you and it\u2019s even more difficult to investigate a random person\u2019s background and character. If some evil person was hired, what\u2019s to stop them from kidnapping the children and selling them?\u201dYaoniang thought about it and agreed. \u201cI will come back again after half a year, but I think it\u2019s still better to hire someone. Even if they can\u2019t help with watching over the children, they could help with the housework. Those two women don\u2019t do anything themselves but make you do everything. Even if you feel it\u2019s fine, I feel tired on your behalf.\u201dAs she talked, Yao Cheng walked in with a smile on his face. \u201cBrother Zhou is really courteous. He got up early in the morning to help us sweep the yard.\u201dOnly then did Yaoniang learn that the sound that she heard earlier that morning was from Zhou Sheng sweeping the yard.\u201cThis Brother Zhou is a pretty good man, Yaoyao what do you think?\u201d\u201cBig Brother Zhou is pretty nice\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Huiniang broke into a sweat once she heard what had transpired. \u201cThese people are too lawless. Even under broad daylight, they dare to kidnap young women.\u201d\u201cThis is definitely not the first time for them to do this. Thankfully we had the insignia of Jin Wang Mansion on our carriage. No one in this county would dare to pull out a tiger\u2019s whiskers.\u201d\u201cLooks like it\u2019s not so bad for Yaoyao to be working at the prince\u2019s mansion.\u201dAs the three were talking, Hong\u2019er and Xiaobao awoke. After they put some clothes on the children and washed their faces, Yaoniang and Huiniang went to the kitchen to prepare breakfast. Yao Cheng stayed behind to look after the children. While Yaoniang stood in the kitchen making breakfast, she could hear Mrs. Li\u2019s enthusiasm as she talked with Zhou Sheng outside.\u201cSister, what\u2019s she up to this time?\u201d Mrs. Li wasn\u2019t the type of person to be courteous to others. Now that her words were nothing but polite, Yaoniang was sure that she was up to no good.\u201cWhat else could it be but\u2026.\u201dHuiniang told Yaoniang about what had happened to Yan\u2019er.Yaoniang was so shocked that her mouth dropped in surprise. It was way beyond her expectations. Did this also happen in her past life? But since Yaoniang never returned home in her past life, there was no way for her to learn about what had happened to Yan\u2019er.As she thought about it, she realized this was karma for Yan\u2019er\u2019s past evil deeds. The pressure in her chest that had accumulated over her two lifetimes disappeared at the news. She felt her entire body had lightened.\u201cSo she wants to matchmake Big Brother Zhou and Yan\u2019er together?\u201dHuiniang looked at her younger sister and noted that she wasn\u2019t completely stupid.\u201cThis mustn\u2019t be done! Brother Zhou is a good person, we can\u2019t hurt him like this.\u201d Yaoniang immediately wanted to go out but was held back by Huiniang. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. Do you think your Brother Zhou is a fool? There\u2019s no way he would fall for the mother and daughter\u2019s schemes\u201dYaoniang heard those words and asked, \u201cSister, what do you mean by my Brother Zhou?\u201dHuiniang looked at her younger sister with great interest. \u201cThis Brother Zhou\u2019s eyes are only filled with you. Don\u2019t tell me you never noticed it.\u201dYaoniang actually never noticed it. She simply thought that Zhou Sheng was too nice but she never expected that he would have these kinds of thoughts. She recalled their conversation on the way here and how he had asked whether she was interested in getting married again\u2026\u201cI feel that this Zhou Sheng is quite good. Since he knows your situation and is willing to be with you, he won\u2019t care about how you were supposedly married or that you also have a child.\u201dYaoniang said, \u201cHe\u2019s not a widower and he has never gotten married before. How could he want someone like me?\u201dHuiniang didn\u2019t want to listen to all this. She looked at her younger sister and said, \u201cWhat do you mean by someone like you hmm? My family\u2019s Yaoyao is the best woman in the world and deserves to be treated as such.\u201d\u201cSister\u2026\u2026\u201dHuiniang patted her on the head. \u201cWell, just keep your sister\u2019s words in your heart. It\u2019s not easy for a woman to live on her own with a child. Since someone is willing to be with you, why not consider it? Sister also hopes that you will find a man in the future, someone who can look after you, take care of you and love you.\u201dLook for a man?Yaoniang fell silent. She glanced at Zhou Sheng, who was washing the carriage in the courtyard. It happened that Zhou Sheng also looked over and they made eye contact with each other. She saw the joy in his eyes so she instinctively lowered her head then somehow thought of Jin Wang.At Jin Wang Manor, in Zhaohui Hall, Jin Wang received the third secret letter sent from Shadow Guard Eleven.A few characters were written on the narrow strip of paper: The driver stayed for another day. The family has the intention of matchmaking.Fucheng stood to the side and wished he could crane his neck to read it.But the key point was that he dared not. Instead, he couldn\u2019t wait to bury his head in the sand.Ever since his highness had received the first secret message from Shadow Guard Eleven, he exuded coldness. By now, the air surrounding him had completely frozen. Fucheng wasn\u2019t interested in bringing further contempt on himself by asking for the content of the message.Jin Wang stood up suddenly and walked out. \u201cPrepare a horse!\u201dFucheng choked. Where is this man going? It then registered in his mind that his highness was going to find Nanny Su.Mrs. Li insisted on keeping Zhou Sheng in the Yao Family house for one more day. She even used her status as a senior to achieve this, so Zhou Sheng could only agree to it.Mrs. Li, who received a satisfactory outcome, went to look for her son with joy. But who would have thought that she would hit a wall at Yao Cheng\u2019s place?\u201cMother, I advise you to dismiss this idea. His family background is clean and not that shabby. Why should he marry a woman like Yan\u2019er? Although both Huiniang and I treat Zhou Sheng as a brother-in-law, it\u2019s not because of Yan\u2019er, but because of Yaoyao. She\u2019s the entire reason as to why he\u2019s even here. Don\u2019t tell me that Yan\u2019er has taken a fancy to Zhou Sheng. Why is it that whenever a man who likes Yaoyao, Yan\u2019er has to stick her foot in? Don\u2019t say that I didn\u2019t warn her. If she messes up again, I will send her to the Guzi Temple and force her to be a nun!\u201dYao Cheng couldn\u2019t be blamed for his harsh words. He has been annoyed by his mother and sister for a long time already. It was one thing if it was only Mrs. Li, she\u2019s his mother and there\u2019s nothing he could do to her. But he really doesn\u2019t have any good feelings for his sister, Yan\u2019er.Even though she was his biological sister, Yao Cheng had never been close to Yan\u2019er even when they were children. Yan\u2019er had been a thief when she was a child, and she would lie and cheat her way out of trouble. It often ended up being Yao Cheng who got punished by Mrs. Li. The incident with Yaoniang also let Yao Cheng realize that his younger sister had been spoiled rotten by their mother. Her heart was so vicious that chills would run down one\u2019s back at the mere thought of it.Ever since the incident with Feng Heizi, Yan\u2019er has made a huge fuss. Yao Cheng believes that if her fate wasn\u2019t good, simply let it be. As long as she could cherish what she already has, she wouldn\u2019t have a miserable life. He tried to look for people to be Yan\u2019er\u2019s husband, but she would either dislike them for being poor, for being old, or for already having children of their own. She wasn\u2019t interested in being a stepmother.But the problem was that with the way Yan\u2019er was now, whoever wished to marry her and was without a son, would have no choice but to cut off his lineage.Mrs. Li did not expect her son to speak so harshly. She stretched out her hand, slapped him twice, and angrily said. \u201cWho exactly is your sister? It\u2019s certainly not Su Yaoniang, so why are you always looking after her! You white-eyed wolf have married a wife and forgotten your mother! You deny your biological sister for the sake of your wife?!\u201d\u201cJust take it as if I\u2019ve married a wife and forgotten my mother. Huiniang treats you so well. You and Yan\u2019er only need to open your mouth and meals are served. What have you ever done for the family? All you do is point your fingers and order Huiniang to do everything. You even have the audacity to find fault with her! If you sincerely wish for your son to be successful, our Yao Family to be glorious, don\u2019t make Yaoyao unhappy. She now serves at the little princess\u2019s side. For the sake of this relationship, County Magistrate Qian is planning to promote me to be the department head! If you think this department head position isn\u2019t worth it, continue acting according to your wishes!\u201dIn the end, it was still the son who best understands his mother. Mrs. Li really does love Yan\u2019er. But when compared with her son\u2019s future, her dream of being a rich wife, and the future of the Yao Family, her love for Yan\u2019er has to step back.After Yao Cheng left, Mrs. Li smacked her lips. \u201cTsk. A person can be worth so much from working in the prince\u2019s manor? It\u2019s not like she\u2019s struck gold.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After Mrs. Li\u2019s attitude changed, to please Yaoniang, she immediately decided to let Yan\u2019er move out of the West Chamber. She arranged for Yan\u2019er to move in and live with herself in the main room and for Yaoniang to live in the West Chamber.Mrs. Li said that since Yaoniag was only here for a few days, she shouldn\u2019t live in such a small room. Anyways, the West Chambers are now vacant.Yaoniang wanted to turn her down, but Huiniang didn\u2019t let her. She could only tidy up her bedding and move to the West Chamber to live.Now, she lives in the same room that she used to live in.It was Zhou Sheng who helped her move her belongings. After her conversation with Huiniang, Yaoniang felt embarrassed whenever she saw Zhou Sheng. Zhou Sheng didn\u2019t take it seriously but had a smile on his face as he helped her.A woman who was familiar with Mrs. Li came by to talk to her and happened to see Zhou Sheng and Yaoniang moving together. She asked if this was Yaoniang\u2019s husband. Before, Huiniang had gone out to give wedding candies from house to house and had told her about Yaoniang\u2019s marriage.Mrs. Li received her son\u2019s instructions so she nodded and said yes. The woman commented that they were a match made in heaven, then followed Mrs. Li inside the house. Yaoniang blushed, and after a glance to see there was no one else around, confessed to Zhou Sheng, \u201cMost people here don\u2019t know that my husband is dead.\u201dIt could be regarded as an explanation for what the woman had said and that it was all caused by a misunderstanding.Zhou Sheng was red in the face. When he heard her words, he felt sorry for her. He looked at Yaoniang in the eyes. \u201cMy condolences.\u201d Yaoniang automatically avoided the obvious affection in his eyes and pretended to be preoccupied with the task at hand. The matter passed just like that.When it was time for Huiniang to make dinner, she asked Yaoniang to go out and help buy vinegar.She feared that Yaoniang wouldn\u2019t be able to carry the vinegar jar on her own so she also asked Zhou Sheng to go with her. In fact, Huiniang was trying to create a chance for Zhou Sheng to spend some time with Yaoniang alone.Zhou Sheng was more than willing to do this. Carrying the empty vinegar jar, he went out with YaoniangMost people around here knew Yaoniang. When they saw her, they would greet her and many couldn\u2019t resist glancing at the man next to her. Someone teased them and said that the young couple has such a good relationship that they even go shopping together.Many believed that Zhou Sheng was Yaoniang\u2019s husband, the street vendor.Yaoniang didn\u2019t dare to admit the truth. Zhou Sheng was ecstatic upon hearing the comments and he eagerly listened to everyone call Yaoniang his wife. Maybe he really could marry the beauty back.A lot has happened during this trip to Yaoniang\u2019s hometown. Despite those lawless men they met on the way, Zhou Sheng was still content in his heart. Even he didn\u2019t expect his and Yaoniang\u2019s relationship to progress so fast. Although Zhou Sheng was an honest man, he wasn\u2019t stupid. He could tell that Yaoniang\u2019s older sister and brother-in-law were interested in matchmaking him with Yaoniang.As the evening approached, the night market was bustling and many stalls selling goods were set up along both sides of the street. There was everything for sale, and cries advertising their wares sounded one after anotherYaoniang bought some vinegar and had Zhou Sheng carry the vinegar jar. As she walked, she would look around at the vegetables from the vegetable stalls. She wanted to add some freshness to the dinner table for that night.Yaoniang chose some veggies and asked the vendor to tie them together. She reached into her purse to take out some money to pay for the vegetables. But before she could even take out her money, Zhou Sheng managed to pay for the food first.\u201cHow can I let Big Brother Zhou pay for this?\u201d Yaoniang said to him as she gestured to the vendor to return the money that Zhou Sheng had given him.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that? I didn\u2019t pay anything despite living at your house for over a day. Paying a little for the vegetables is nothing.\u201dAs the two were arguing over this, they heard a shriek from next to them.Yaoniang turned her head to look and saw something black flying towards herself.Before she could even react, she was lifted into the air and seated on a horse. In a blink of an eye, the horse that took her was gone.Only then did someone react and shout \u201cSomeone was kidnapped!\u201dOthers shouted to Zhou Sheng, \u201cYour wife has been kidnapped! Quick, go report to the officials!\u201dZhou Sheng was stunned on the spot, unable to recover even after a long time.He had seen the face of the man on the horse.It wasn\u2019t an exaggeration to say that it had all happened at the speed of lightning. Yaoniang could even feel the wind brushing against her face.Her mind was blank and even now, she still hasn\u2019t regained her composure. When she pulled herself together, she realized that someone was sitting behind her.She was too familiar with this scent. It was Jin Wang.Why was Jin Wang here?She wanted to speak, but her voice couldn\u2019t be heard over the wind. She could only keep her lips shut.Finally, after waiting for the speed of the horse to slow down, she turned her head and asked, \u201cYour highness, what are you\u2026\u201dShe trailed off once she saw Jin Wang\u2019s face which was as cold as frost. The horse reaccelerated its pace, and Yaoniang could only hold onto Jin Wang\u2019s sleeves tightly and shrink back like a quail.The horse had already run beyond the borders of the county, but it continued without stopping.Yaoniang was a little uncomfortable from the jolting of the horse, and she tried to summon the courage to speak several times. But once she saw Jin Wang\u2019s gloomy expression, she couldn\u2019t help but stay silent.Jin Wang was angry.But why?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 74": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Jin Wang Dotes on His ConcubineCH 49.2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAs Yaoniang was entertaining all sorts of weird thoughts in her head, she suddenly felt something strange poking her from behind.Immediately, she knew what it was. What surprised her was that Jin Wang could still be affectionate even at a time like this. In summer, the clothes they wore were thin, so with such a big and hot thing pushed against her in broad daylight, it was inevitable for her to be embarrassed.Yaoniang\u2019s face flushed and her ears turned red, but she didn\u2019t dare to say a single word. She could only suffer in silence. But as the horse continued to run, her body also jolted up and down from the animal\u2019s movement. Suddenly, that thing changed its position, moving from her lower back to her bottom.She trembled and tried to move away, but was held down by a big hand.\u201cDon\u2019t move. Sit still. If you fall, this prince can\u2019t help you.\u201dThere was no ambiguity in these words, but Yaoniang felt they were a little weird.The horse ran very fast and his sturdy arms were wrapped around her waist. The temperature was only a little warm, but Yaoniang felt like she was being burned by a hot iron. That naughty thing wasn\u2019t obedient at all. Because of the horse\u2019s movement, it kept poking into that place. As the prodding continued, Yaoniang became soft.At some point, the horse\u2019s speed had slowed down.Yaoniang didn\u2019t notice it. Instead, she blurted out the question in her heart, \u201cWhy did your highness come here?\u201dJin Wang, who sat behind her, didn\u2019t speak. The hand that held the horse\u2019s reins clenched and repeatedly brushed against her as the horse continued galloping. Due to the friction, two small rosebuds hidden under Yaoniang\u2019s clothes bloomed.They were heavy and swollen. Doctor Liu\u2019s medicine was very effective. Yaoniang hadn\u2019t produced so much milk in a long time. As a mother, whenever she felt that she was full of milk, she would automatically think that it was time to feed her child.\u201cYour highness, you should send me back. It\u2019s already time for Xiaobao to eat. I need to go back to feed the child\u2026\u201dHalfway through her sentence, she felt a little chilly. She couldn\u2019t help but shrink back and that thing slammed into her.It had never been so rough before, but this time it shocked her. With her breath suspended, she glanced down and realized how far off the ground she was. Afraid that she will fall, she instinctively pushed closer towards Jin Wang. But the motion only pushed that thing in deeper, and a moan from Jin Wang sounded in her ear.Yaoniang squeezed Jin Wang\u2019s arm tightly. For the first time, she neglected etiquette and forgot her status. With her scream hidden in her throat, she almost couldn\u2019t stop herself from crying out. Her body was stiff and she trembled. Her tears could not be held back, and her red lips whimpered, \u201cYour highness, I really need to go back, let me go back\u2026\u201dHer voice was very quiet. She didn\u2019t even dare to breathe too hard, for fear of making unusual noises.Jin Wang casually said, \u201cThis prince will send you back later\u2026\u201dThen Yaoniang realized that the horse had sped up.~Yaoniang got off the horse and her legs were so weak that she almost fell to the ground.Although Jin Wang had never explained why he was here, her intuition told her that he was here to warn her.Was it because of Brother Zhou?Jin Wang instinctively stretched out his hand to hold her, then saw that she managed to stand on her own. He snorted coldly, turned the horse around and rode into the night, disappearing as quickly as he had appeared.The sky was completely dark and Yaoniang didn\u2019t dare to delay. She hurried towards the door of her house.She didn\u2019t dare to think too much, her mind was a mess, and she didn\u2019t know how she should explain to her family where she was during her disappearance. She wondered whether Big Brother Zhou had seen Jin Wang\u2019s face. At least he should have told her family about her being taken away. But how should she explain herself now that she is back?The house must be in chaos at this point\u2026But when Yaoniang arrived at the door of her house, there was only silence. She could faintly see some lights inside because the door was not shut completely, only partially closed.Yaoniang stretched out her hand and pushed open the door. Some lights and voices were coming from the main room. She hurried over anxiously.When the bamboo curtain was pushed aside, the people sitting at the table eating in the main hall turned and looked at her in surprise.\u201cYou\u2019re finally back! Zhou Sheng said that while you guys were out, you had met a girl who worked in the same courtyard as you. Then you went to her house to visit. I was planning to have your brother-in-law go find you after dinner,\u201d said HuiniangYao Cheng asked, \u201cHave you eaten? Sit down and eat if you haven\u2019t eaten.\u201dAfter listening to her sister, Yaoniang automatically looked at Zhou Sheng who was sitting next to Mrs. Li. The two of them made eye contact then quickly looked away.Yaoniang realized that Zhou Sheng must have immediately recognized the man on the horse, then invented that excuse to cover up for her.To avoid suspicion, Yaoniang said, \u201cSister, I have already eaten. I came back so late because I had eaten some dinner.\u201d For some unknown reason, she suddenly recalled the time when Jin Wang had said that he would fill her up lest she is hungry. As an honest and conservative girl raised in a scholarly family, when had she ever heard this type of nonsense? She hadn\u2019t understood it at the time but now, she realized the hidden meaning of those words.She felt as if her entire body was lit on fire. She didn\u2019t dare stay any longer, for fear of being noticed by the others. She hurriedly said, \u201cYou eat, I\u2019ll go into the house and watch the children.\u201d Then she hurried away.\u201cYou little girl, Xiaobao and Hong\u2019er are already asleep\u2026\u201dHuiniang\u2019s words didn\u2019t stop her.Yaoniang had a feeling that there was a pair of eyes fixed on her back. They belonged to Zhou Sheng. The gaze made her want to escape.Once she returned to her room, it was all silent.Both Xiaobao and Hong\u2019er laid quietly on the small bed, fast asleep.Yaoniang felt uncomfortable everywhere. It seemed as if her bones were still reverberating, and certain places on her body were hot and painful. Especially those places.She grabbed a water basin, filled it with some hot water in the kitchen, then went back to her room to take a bath. Only after looking closely did she realize how vigorous Jin Wang was when he had tossed her around. There were hickeys and marks all over her.Yaoniang didn\u2019t dare to delay. She hurriedly got out of the tub and changed into her clothes. Then she went outside to pour the water out and finally calmed her heart.The night was destined to be long, Yaoniang did not close her eyes all night.Early the next morning, Zhou Sheng left.He didn\u2019t tell anyone, but just quietly left. Huiniang complained about why he had left in such a hurry, but Yaoniang knew why Zhou Sheng had left without even eating breakfast. Not just him, but she also felt ashamed to look at him.In fact, Yaoniang knew when Zhou Sheng had left. She hesitated, but ultimately, she didn\u2019t go out to send him off. Things were already like this and she had no plans to marry anyways. This way, she also completely extinguished the last flame in her heart.Huiniang reminded her to still consider Zhou Sheng as a potential partner. Yaoniang agreed on the surface, but in her heart, she knew that it was impossible for her to be together with Zhou Sheng.No one would dare to provoke the prince\u2019s woman.Mini-theatre:King Jin: <(\uffe3\ufe36\uffe3)> Hehe I feel great, so great\u2026Yao Niang: o(\u256f\u25a1\u2570)o Ugh I\u2019m completely hollowed out\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 75": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Jin Wang Dotes on His ConcubineCH 50.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayYaoniang took a total of five days of leave for this trip.It took two days to travel back and forth, so she could only stay at home for three days.Yaoniang hesitated whether to go back to her maiden home, the Su Family, but she decided not to go after thinking about it. She spent the entirety of her trip and spare time helping Huiniang with the housework. She took apart the beddings to wash them and cleaned the entire house inside out. She also dug out the clothes of Xiaobao, Hong\u2019er and Ming\u2019er and patched up whatever was necessary.Xiaobao grew fast and many of his clothes couldn\u2019t\u00a0be worn\u00a0anymore.\u00a0Since the season was changing soon, Yaoniang took out some new fabric that she had brought back to make some new pants for Xiaobao and Hong\u2019er. At their age, their pants are\u00a0frequently\u00a0soiled and must\u00a0be changed\u00a0throughout the day.She selected the fabric that Mammy Mu had rewarded her, which\u00a0was made\u00a0of fine cotton.\u00a0Yaoniang didn\u2019t know what the name of this cloth was, and she had never seen such good material outside the prince\u2019s mansion anyway. The material didn\u2019t look exquisite or expensive. In fact, it looked like a piece of ordinary cotton fabric, but the texture of the fabric was\u00a0extremely\u00a0fine and soft. The clothes worn by the little princess were all made of this type of cloth.Yaoniang spread the cloth on the table, estimated the amount needed for Xiaobao and Hong\u2019er, then cut it with a pair of scissors. As she was about to sew, she realized that they had no thread of the same colour at home.The fabric was light blue, but Huiniang\u2019s thread collection did not contain any thread of this colour. If she were to use threads of different colours, it would ruin the final product\u2019s appearance.Yaoniang told Huiniang that she planned to go to the embroidery workshop to buy some embroidery thread. Huiniang agreed and told her to return soon. Yaoniang took her money with her and went out.The closest embroidery workshop was a little far away from the Yao Family home. Yaoniang walked for a quarter of an hour before she finally arrived.\u00a0When she arrived at the embroidery workshop, she picked up an embroidery thread in the matching colour and paid for it.Halfway on her way back, she\u00a0was stopped by\u00a0a shout.\u201cYaoniang!\u201dYaoniang turned around and saw that it was Chen An.Yaoniang wasn\u2019t very familiar with Chen An, they had only met a couple of times. She didn\u2019t even know that Chen An\u00a0was interested\u00a0in her until after the accident.This was a classic example of a man sitting at home, while disaster struck from heaven. The former Yaoniang felt resentful towards Chen An, he could\u2019ve liked anyone, but it\u00a0just\u00a0had to be her out of all people. But this way of thinking was to shift the blame onto others to help vent her anger. After a long time, this type of resentment will\u00a0eventually\u00a0fade.At this moment, as she looked at the man, who had a hint of excitement in his eyes while looking at her, Yaoniang felt a little complicated. She couldn\u2019t pretend that she didn\u2019t know him, so she could only remain silent.\u201cHow are you?\u201d Chen An looked at Yaoniang almost\u00a0greedily\u00a0as if he wished he could carve her into his bones.Actually, Chen An didn\u2019t fall in love with Yaoniang from seeing her at the Yao Family, but from even earlier than that. He would even come up with all sorts of excuses to visit the Yao Family to see Yaoniang.It was well known that the leader, Yao Cheng, had a beautiful and virtuous younger sister-in-law and that she even lived in his house.\u00a0It was inevitable that some people would tease him and say that he had better not go to the wrong bed by accident and end up sleeping with his sister-in-law.But this resulted in Yao Cheng not leaving them any face as he scolded them.Everyone knew that although the leader was\u00a0normally\u00a0an easy-going man with a good temper, this matter wasn\u2019t something they could make fun of.\u00a0Later, when they heard that the leader wished to find a husband for his sister-in-law, several young men who worked under Yao Cheng\u00a0were moved.Chen An was one of them.Everyone knew that the leader\u2019s sister-in-law was also the daughter of a\u00a0scholarly\u00a0family. At that time, daughters from\u00a0scholarly\u00a0families were one of the best choices as a wife. Plus, Yao Cheng had said more than once that his sister-in-law was beautiful and virtuous.\u00a0A beautiful, gentle, virtuous woman and had a good family background would interest any man.Chen An, who made up a random excuse, had gone to visit the Yao Family house. Afterwards, the man returned, but the soul didn\u2019t.After he returned home, he would think about her every day, but he didn\u2019t dare to tell anyone he worked with. What if they wished to compete with him when they found out? He had asked his mother to go to the Yao Family to propose marriage, but his mother was unwilling. When he asked for the reason, he learned that his mother planned to make him a couple with his cousin.If there was no Yaoniang, he would be fine with marrying his cousin. It didn\u2019t matter who he married. But with Yaoniang in the picture, his cousin was like a fisheye.\u00a0While Chen An tried to come up with something to make his mother give up this idea, he also concocted all sorts of excuses in an attempt to see Yaoniang.Chen An knew that Yan\u2019er liked him.That girl was an ill-mannered one. She would stop him in the street and stuff money into his clothes. Chen An would never accept it. He was a conservative man, and he couldn\u2019t bear to see a woman acting so slutty.But he never expected that Yan\u2019er would actually attack Yaoniang. At the time, Chen An wasn\u2019t clear about what had happened. He only knew that something had occurred at the Yao Family. The team leader also hadn\u2019t appeared at the office for several days. He couldn\u2019t rest assured and wanted another chance to see Yaoniang, so he visited the Yao Family house.He couldn\u2019t go inside but saw Yan\u2019er at the door.She told him that Yaoniang had\u00a0been dirtied by\u00a0an evil man and that she was no longer a virgin.Chen An\u00a0was shocked\u00a0and he couldn\u2019t believe it. He felt that Yan\u2019er was lying to him. To check whether she was right, he approached Yao Cheng. Yao Cheng didn\u2019t say a single word. He only dragged him to the corner and beat him\u00a0harshly. How could Chen An not understand?He was in a daze for many days. His mother had even gone behind his back and betrothed him to his cousin. What\u00a0was done\u00a0couldn\u2019t be undone, Chen An could only let the matter go. But he would always remember Yaoniang, who had become a cinnabar mole in his heart that couldn\u2019t\u00a0be erased.Naturally, Yaoniang didn\u2019t know about his mental struggles. She only felt that this man was too rash.\u201cIf there\u2019s nothing wrong, I\u2019ll get going.\u201d Yaoniang didn\u2019t answer his question. She turned her head and was about to leave when she\u00a0was grabbed\u00a0from behind.\u201cHow are you? Don\u2019t you know that I\u2019ve always been thinking about you?\u201d\u201cLet go!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not letting go. Actually, Yaoniang, I\u2019ve always wanted to tell you that I don\u2019t care whether you are a virgin. The only person I want to marry is you and I want to take care of you for the rest of my life\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After a period of time, this feeling\u00a0gradually\u00a0faded.But now he already has a wife. Yet he still said that he wanted to marry her and take care of her for the rest of his life. Yaoniang believes there was a problem with his character.\u201cI am indeed married, but the person that I married wasn\u2019t someone I wanted to marry. It was my mother\u2026\u201d At first, he was a little bit ashamed to speak, but his voice\u00a0gradually\u00a0became smoother and calmer. Chen An looked at Yaoniang with affection in his eyes.\u00a0\u201cIf you don\u2019t dislike me for already\u00a0being married, I am willing to also marry you and take care of you and that child forever. As for Tian\u2019er, you don\u2019t need to care about her.\u201dYaoniang had an urge to laugh, and she did. She looked at him with a sneer, \u201cI don\u2019t like you! Yes, I don\u2019t like you. Can you let me go now? If you don\u2019t let me go, I\u2019ll scream for help.\u201dChen An didn\u2019t expect Yaoniang to say that. His face turned pale, and he seemed to have suffered some serious damage.\u201cYaoniang, you\u2026 you are already in this state with a child\u2026 I am even willing to marry you, despite you having a child. You can rest assured that I will treat you well\u2026\u201dYaoniang yanked her hand back, and interrupted him, \u201cDo you think that I should be grateful for you being willing to marry me? I\u2019m not interested! Please don\u2019t come to me again in the future, we are not familiar with each other.\u201d\u201cYaoniang \u2026\u2026\u201dYaoniang left without looking back.There was a carriage parked on the opposite street corner. Seated inside the carriage, Jin Wang\u2019s face was as black as charcoal.By his side, Fucheng\u00a0carefully\u00a0peered at the face of his highness. He didn\u2019t know what he should say. Could he say that these men were\u00a0really\u00a0insightful and that they were all interested in Nanny Su?That day, Jin Wang had left behind all his men; the speed of his horse was too fast. The people who followed also didn\u2019t dare to get too close, so Fucheng had no idea what had happened. All he knew was that after his highness had returned, he was in a much better mood than before.But this was only his guess. Anyway, ever since Jin Wang had come to Linyun County, he never left.Today, An Shiyi passed a message saying that Nanny Su was going out. Jin Wang rarely ordered for a carriage to go out, but he did today.\u00a0Fucheng thought that his highness wasn\u2019t young anymore, yet he still wished to go out and play with his little lover. Nanny Su appeared in the distance, but before they could go over, Demon Chen popped up halfway!How was this playing with his little lover, he was\u00a0obviously\u00a0here to catch them in the act!At least that was what\u00a0was written\u00a0all over Jin Wang\u2019s face when he looked at it.Fucheng felt that the atmosphere was too awkward. Whenever his highness\u00a0was angered, he could only act dead beside him. If he couldn\u2019t share the worries and work for his master, what kind of servant was he?So Fucheng cleared his throat and cursed, \u201cHumph, where did this kid come from? So ignorant! Nanny Su, a prince\u2019s woman, how dare he have ideas about her!\u201dNot only did he fail to get Jin Wang\u2019s praise, but his words also earned a cold shoulder.Jin Wang leaned back and twisted around the sapphire ring on the fourth finger of his right hand. He asked, \u201cHow many days of leave did she take?\u201dFucheng understood Jin Wang\u2019s meaning as if he had received help from a divine being. \u201cNanny Su asked for five days of leave. She spent a day on the way here, stayed at home for three days, so tomorrow, Nanny Su should\u00a0depart\u00a0for the manor.\u201dYaoniang spent most of the evening preparing clothes for Xiaobao and Hong\u2019er before she fell asleep. When she woke up, it was still dark.She\u00a0quietly\u00a0got up, lit the oil lamp, and under the dim light, she got to work again.She cleaned up everywhere and packed the things that she needed to take with her into her bag. Actually, she didn\u2019t have a lot of things to bring with her. When Yaoniang came here, she had brought two big bags with her. Now that she was going back, she only had a small bag with some spare clothes.Huiniang knocked on the door,\u00a0fully\u00a0dressed, then came in. \u201cWhat time is it now? Why did you get up so early? Your brother-in-law said that there was a light coming from your place. I couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201dUnder the dim light, when Huiniang saw her younger sister\u2019s red eyes, she understood. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to go back, don\u2019t go. Even though you haven\u2019t earned a lot of money, you could still get quite a bit of money if you sold those things.\u201dAt this moment, Huiniang had forgotten about Yao Cheng\u2019s upcoming promotion. She believed that if one needed to rely on this type of relationship to get promoted, it would be better not to do it.Yaoniang also knew about this news. When she first came back, Yao Cheng had told her about it. So now, there was an extra factor caused by her working in the Jin Wang Mansion. No matter what, she has to wait for her brother-in-law to settle down in his new position.Of course, it wasn\u2019t only that. Yaoniang also wanted to save more money because she planned to buy a small house in the future. Then she would open a small shop to support herself and her son. But opening a shop wouldn\u2019t be easy. She couldn\u2019t rely on her sister and brother-in-law for everything. The days in the future were still long and she might encounter problems. She would feel safer if she had some silver with her.Now, Yaoniang didn\u2019t plan on marrying anymore. Once upon a time, she had thought that if she met a suitable man who was kind to Xiaobao, it wouldn\u2019t hurt to marry again. But Jin Wang\u00a0really\u00a0scared her that day. She realized that even if she left the prince\u2019s manor one day, it would still be impossible for her to remarry. As Jin Wang\u2019s woman, he wouldn\u2019t allow others to contaminate her, even if he didn\u2019t want her anymore.So, she\u00a0really\u00a0needed silver, the more the better.But this wasn\u2019t something she could explain to her sister. Yaoniang could only smile and say, \u201cIt\u2019s a good job, how could I not do it? The masters of the house are generous, and I plan to work for another one and a half years to earn some more money. But I\u2019ll need to trouble you with Xiaobao.\u201dHuiniang sighed and said, \u201cWhat do you mean by troubling me? Xiaobao is my nephew. Whatever Hong\u2019er has, he would also have. There\u2019s no way I\u2019ll treat him\u00a0badly. And you don\u2019t need to finish packing everything right now. Sleep for a while. Zhou Sheng won\u2019t be here so early.\u201dYaoniang nodded. After she blew out the lamp and returned to her bed, she wondered whether Brother Zhou would come to pick her up. If he asked about the kidnapping incident while they were on the road, what should she say?When she woke up again, it was bright outside, and the yard was very noisy. It seemed like there was a visitor.Yaoniang put on her clothes and pushed the door to go out. She raised her eyes and saw a man standing in the courtyard.He had a black jade crown on his head and wore a black brocade robe embroidered with threads of gold. He was tall and handsome, so handsome that he didn\u2019t seem to be a mortal man. Under the sun, light reflected off his brocade robe and he appeared as if he was glowing.Those long, narrow and dark eyes stared\u00a0directly\u00a0at her. Yaoniang\u2019s cheeks flushed and she\u00a0was dumbfounded.Could someone tell her why Jin Wang was here?!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She stood up and walked to the door to holler at Huiniang to go buy some food. Fearing that Huiniang would not be able to carry too much by herself, she called for Yan\u2019er too. For some reason, Yan\u2019er hid in her room and refused to come out, so in the end, it was Yaoniang who accompanied Huiniang.Yaoniang and Huiniang would go out to shop for food. Yao Cheng would continue to accompany Jin Wang, and Mrs. Li and Yan\u2019er would look after the three children. The eldest brother, Ming\u2019er, already knew how to walk, but at his age, he wasn\u2019t sensible enough not to bump into others. It would be terrible for him to collide into Jin Wang.Huiniang grabbed a basket and left with Yaoniang.Yaoniang felt irritable but it was hard to explain why. Her mind was elsewhere even as she walked down the street. She couldn\u2019t understand why Jin Wang had come to her house, and why he had lied about giving her a ride back to the manor out of convenience. She even thought of the day before yesterday\u2026She had completely immersed herself in her thoughts. She didn\u2019t even notice Huiniang staring at her multiple times.Huiniang pulled her to a stop, looked around their surroundings and saw no one. Then she asked, \u201cTell your sister the truth, why on earth is his highness Jin Wang visiting our house? Is it\u2026 Did\u00a0 you\u2026\u201dYaoniang was shocked. \u201cIs it what? Sister, what are you talking about!\u201dHuiniang glared at her, and continued in a low voice, \u201cDo you think your elder sister is a fool? A majestic prince, the prince of Jinzhou, would come all the way here for no reason? And even offered you a ride back out to the prince\u2019s manor of convenience? You are only a wet nurse! Even if someone were to pick you up, it would be impossible for a prince to come in person to pick you up! You better tell me the truth. Does he fancy you?\u201d\u201cSister\u2026\u201dYaoniang stopped. Huiniang became even more anxious. \u201cTell me, how far have you guys gone? Did you only kiss or did you sleep under the same covers as him?\u201dIt was still Huiniang who understood her sister the best. It was impossible for Yaoniang, with her timid character, to dare to do anything indecent. Huiniang observed Jin Wang\u2019s behaviour today. If one didn\u2019t consider the difference between their statuses, it would be like the time when Yao Cheng had courted her. Originally, she actually didn\u2019t want to marry Yao Cheng, but Yao Cheng would always find excuses to go to her house to pester her. Although that person looks tall and big, he is actually thin-skinned. Yet he could always come up with ridiculous excuses.So Huiniang still held onto some luck in her heart. Maybe his highness Jin Wang took a fancy to her sister, but her sister was too timid to respond. The two of them were still innocent.When has Yaoniang ever discussed this kind of topic with her sister? She was embarrassed to death. Plus with how hot the weather was, there\u2019s no way she would sleep under the same covers as Jin Wang.\u201cNo, no!\u201d She didn\u2019t actually lie. She hasn\u2019t slept under the same covers as Jin Wang.Obviously, this wasn\u2019t enough to deceive Huiniang who was as sharp as a tack. She looked at Yaoniang solemnly. \u201cReally? Do you know what it means to sleep under the same covers? It means that two people are naked and they do this and that\u2026\u201d In the end, even though Huiniang was already a mother of two, she still couldn\u2019t help but be a little embarrassed.Yaoniang\u2019s face turned red, her eyes flickered, she didn\u2019t dare to look straight at Huiniang.When she saw her sister like this, what else couldn\u2019t Huiniang understand? She sighed. Holding the basket for groceries in one hand, she used her other hand to poke Yaoniang on her forehead. \u201cYou, you, how dare you! You have the nerve\u2026\u201d\u201cSister\u2014\u201d Yaoniang looked at Huiniang pitifully, acting both nervous and timid. When Yaoniang was still a child, whenever she did something wrong, she would always make such a face, and Huiniang couldn\u2019t get angry with her.\u201cWhy are you so stupid! You and him\u2026\u201d Huiniang was so frustrated that she turned around and looked at Yaoniang a little dejected. \u201cThen what does he mean? Is he not willing to give you a status? The two of you are just going to be like that?\u201dYaoniang thought for a while, then said: \u201cHe mentioned it but I didn\u2019t want it\u2026\u201d When she saw Huiniang glaring at her, her voice became softer. But she also knew that if she didn\u2019t properly explain herself, her sister would not let her go. Yaoniang continued, \u201cThere are so many women in his inner courtyard, and their fights are fierce. I don\u2019t dare to get involved.\u201dWhat exactly \u2018fights are fierce\u2019 meant, Huiniang didn\u2019t completely understand. But she did understand that since he was a prince, his wives and concubines wouldn\u2019t be of low birth. Yaoniang and herself came from a poor and humble family. Her sister also has a child. If she did appear next to Jin Wang, she would be harassed to death by those women above.But her younger sister\u2019s body was also good at giving birth to children. With a man taking up her body in vain, Huiniang was angered. If Jin Wang was not a prince, she would have asked her husband to beat him up.\u201cThen what are you going to do? Go back with him? Then what\u2019s going to happen in the future? Will he let you come back?\u201dWhen she mentioned this matter, Yaoniang also had no good answer. She could only talk about her own thoughts. \u201cAs a man like him, what kind of woman has he never seen? He is merely after the novelty. Over time, he\u2019ll get bored.\u201d\u201cBut what if he doesn\u2019t get bored? What\u2019s going to happen to Xiaobao? \u201cHuiniang saw that her sister was at a loss for an answer. She also had no ideas. \u201cYou are also a mother. You need to have a plan and think it all through. Let\u2019s not talk about this for now. We will continue to talk about it after we buy the groceries.\u201dThen she hurriedly took Yaoniang to the morning market.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although that person looks tall and big, he is actually thin-skinned. Yet he could always come up with ridiculous excuses.So Huiniang still held onto some luck in her heart. Maybe his highness Jin Wang took a fancy to her sister, but her sister was too timid to respond. The two of them were still innocent.When has Yaoniang ever discussed this kind of topic with her sister? She was embarrassed to death. Plus with how hot the weather was, there\u2019s no way she would sleep under the same covers as Jin Wang.\u201cNo, no!\u201d She didn\u2019t actually lie. She hasn\u2019t slept under the same covers as Jin Wang.Obviously, this wasn\u2019t enough to deceive Huiniang who was as sharp as a tack. She looked at Yaoniang solemnly. \u201cReally? Do you know what it means to sleep under the same covers? It means that two people are naked and they do this and that\u2026\u201d In the end, even though Huiniang was already a mother of two, she still couldn\u2019t help but be a little embarrassed.Yaoniang\u2019s face turned red, her eyes flickered, she didn\u2019t dare to look straight at Huiniang.When she saw her sister like this, what else couldn\u2019t Huiniang understand? She sighed. Holding the basket for groceries in one hand, she used her other hand to poke Yaoniang on her forehead. \u201cYou, you, how dare you! You have the nerve\u2026\u201d\u201cSister\u2014\u201d Yaoniang looked at Huiniang pitifully, acting both nervous and timid. When Yaoniang was still a child, whenever she did something wrong, she would always make such a face, and Huiniang couldn\u2019t get angry with her.\u201cWhy are you so stupid! You and him\u2026\u201d Huiniang was so frustrated that she turned around and looked at Yaoniang a little dejected. \u201cThen what does he mean? Is he not willing to give you a status? The two of you are just going to be like that?\u201dYaoniang thought for a while, then said: \u201cHe mentioned it but I didn\u2019t want it\u2026\u201d When she saw Huiniang glaring at her, her voice became softer. But she also knew that if she didn\u2019t properly explain herself, her sister would not let her go. Yaoniang continued, \u201cThere are so many women in his inner courtyard, and their fights are fierce. I don\u2019t dare to get involved.\u201dWhat exactly \u2018fights are fierce\u2019 meant, Huiniang didn\u2019t completely understand. But she did understand that since he was a prince, his wives and concubines wouldn\u2019t be of low birth. Yaoniang and herself came from a poor and humble family. Her sister also has a child. If she did appear next to Jin Wang, she would be harassed to death by those women above.But her younger sister\u2019s body was also good at giving birth to children. With a man taking up her body in vain, Huiniang was angered. If Jin Wang was not a prince, she would have asked her husband to beat him up.\u201cThen what are you going to do? Go back with him? Then what\u2019s going to happen in the future? Will he let you come back?\u201dWhen she mentioned this matter, Yaoniang also had no good answer. She could only talk about her own thoughts. \u201cAs a man like him, what kind of woman has he never seen? He is merely after the novelty. Over time, he\u2019ll get bored.\u201d\u201cBut what if he doesn\u2019t get bored? What\u2019s going to happen to Xiaobao? \u201cHuiniang saw that her sister was at a loss for an answer. She also had no ideas. \u201cYou are also a mother. You need to have a plan and think it all through. Let\u2019s not talk about this for now. We will continue to talk about it after we buy the groceries.\u201dThen she hurriedly took Yaoniang to the morning market.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There were all kinds of food for sale and cries from vendors promoting their products sounded one after another.Because of the resentment in her heart, Huiniang was reluctant to buy anything. She felt that giving the food she prepared to Jin Wang was too much of a loss.As they passed by a stall selling fish, a crucian carp jumped around in its container of water. Merely looking at it would make one\u2019s heart happy. But noticing that her elder sister had a sullen face, Yaoniang dared not speak up.Huiniang didn\u2019t miss her sister\u2019s glance. She gave her an angry look and approached the vendor to ask how much the fish cost. The price wasn\u2019t too expensive. The fish was indeed good, but Hui Niang still spent a long time picking and choosing before she finally bought two fish.Huiniang had never been like this before. But today it was because she was preoccupied with the thoughts in her mind.When they came to the pork stall, Yaoniang wanted to buy some pork chops. Only after Huiniang expressed her disdain did she reluctantly buy two pieces. They continued to buy their groceries in this manner. On their way home, Huiniang glared at her sister, hating iron for not turning to steel, and said,\u00a0 \u201cLook at your good for nothing attitude!\u201dYaoniang felt very wronged. Obviously, she was doing it for the sake of the overall situation. No matter what, Jin Wang was also a prince. Now that he came to visit the Yao Family, it wouldn\u2019t be appropriate to send him off with only some snacks. But it also wasn\u2019t her who asked Jin Wang to remain behind for a meal.Back at Locust Tree Alley, the entire alley was quiet.When they arrived at the door of the Yao Family house, they saw many guards standing outside the door and in the courtyard. Yaoniang also noticed her next-door neighbour peering over from their front door.Seeing this, she felt a headache. She didn\u2019t know what to do in the future.But Huiniang was full of energy and she looked like she was ready to settle accounts with someone. Yaoniang was afraid of what her strong-tempered sister could do. Once the sisters walked inside their home, Yaoniang pinched her sister as a warning. Huiniang asked her, \u201cYou think your sister is a fool!?\u201dOnly then did Yaoniang feel relieved inside.But before she could breathe a sigh of relief, she saw Huiniang put the basket of groceries on the ground and walked directly to the main room. She looked over, only to see Yan\u2019er inching towards Jin Wang. Even from far away, she could sense the chill emanating from Jin Wang. Fucheng stood awkwardly to the side and next to him was Mrs. Li with a bright smile on her face.What did Yan\u2019er want?Yaoniang couldn\u2019t help but clench her hand, and hurriedly followed Huiniang.Huiniang walked into the main room and stepped forward to grab Yan\u2019er. \u201cYan\u2019er, I need a helper while cooking. Come and give me some help.\u201d As she spoke, she held onto Yan\u2019er with one hand to drag her out.Yan\u2019er didn\u2019t want to leave. \u201cI\u2019m not going! Have Yaoniang assist you\u2026\u201dHuiniang smiled on her face, but secretly pinched her using great strength. \u201cWhat, I can\u2019t have you assist me in the kitchens? It won\u2019t be easy to find a husband with your current attitude\u2026\u201d Yan\u2019er was barely given a chance to resist before she was dragged away.Mrs. Li couldn\u2019t react in time. By the time she returned to her senses, Yan\u2019er had already been taken away by Huiniang.When she passed by Yaoniang, Huiniang glanced at her and said, \u201cYou should change the tea for his highness. Mother and Yan\u2019er are too clumsy and might cause an accident.\u201dYaoniang was already dumbfounded, but she soon understood her sister\u2019s meaning. With a quick sigh, she hurried inside the room.Mrs. Li spouted a random excuse and rushed out, narrowly avoiding bumping into Yaoniang. Yaoniang was disgusted in her heart and ignored her. Jin Wang continued to exude chilliness inside the room, and Fucheng who stood behind him was easily overlooked.Jin Wang cleared his throat, and Fucheng went outside like an honest man. He didn\u2019t walk far but stood by the door.\u201cYour highness, would you like this servant to help you change the tea?\u201d asked Yaoniang.Jin Wang raised his eyes and glanced at her then nodded.Yaoniang changed the tea and placed it on the table next to him. She wasn\u2019t sure whether she should leave or stay, especially with Jin Wang staring at her with his pair of dark eyes. She became nervous.\u201cWhy did your highness think about coming here? Actually, there\u2019s no need for you to pick me up. Big Brother Zhou told me that he will pick me up on his way back\u2026\u201dAs soon as the words left her mouth, Yaoniang regretted it. Sure enough, Jin Wang\u2019s face became cold.\u201cDid this prince allow you to call him Big Brother Zhou?\u201dThe question was clearly off-topic. Yaoniang thought if she didn\u2019t call him Big Brother Zhou, what else could she call him? Was Jin Wang jealous?But apart from being jealous, Yaoniang had no idea why he would be like this. That day, he had kidnapped her on the street then punished her severely. Today, he even visited the Yao Family so early. What else could it be apart from him being jealous? He seemed to be jealous of Zhou ShengShe glanced at him secretly and saw that his eyebrows were slightly furrowed. His eyes stared at herself with a fierce glint.Yaoniang was too familiar with this glint in his eyes. Whenever he tossed her around, he always looked like this. But this was not Jin Wang Mansion, they were at the Yao Family\u2026 Yaoniang was timid and carrying a tone of wanting to please him, she said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t let me call him that, I won\u2019t call him that.\u201dJin Wang stared at her. Clearly, he was the one who was sitting and she was the one who was standing, but Yaoniang still felt a sense of oppression for an unknown reason.Only once she saw him nod his head did she become relieved. When she looked at him again, he wasn\u2019t looking at herself anymore. She had no clue what he was thinking.After a long while, Jin Wang glanced at her. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of standing? It\u2019s not like there are no chairs here.\u201dYaoniang immediately found a chair to sit on.Once she sat down, Jin Wang had another complaint. \u201cSitting too far away!\u201d He jerked his chin towards the chair next to him. Yaoniang could only stand up again and sit down on the chair next to himOnly then did Jin Wang gaze at her again. He looked her up and down then said, \u201cYou need to be self-aware.\u201dSelf-aware\u2026?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 80": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Jin Wang Dotes on His ConcubineCH 52.2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayYaoniang\u2019s thoughts were too obvious. Jin Wang could see through her expression with a single glance. He frowned and patiently explained, \u201cYou are this prince\u2019s woman. You are not allowed to get involved with those carriage drivers and bailiffs. If this happens again, this prince will not spare you!\u201dWhen he mentioned carriage drivers, what he actually meant was Zhou Sheng.Bailiff? Yaoniang suddenly remembered Chen An whom she had run into yesterday. Could he be the one that Jin Wang meant?She looked at Jin Wang suspiciously, but Jin Wang didn\u2019t explain further. Instead, he said with disgust, \u201cWho was that woman? If it weren\u2019t for seeing that she is a member of this family, this prince would have long ordered her to be dragged out. \u201cThe way Jin Wang acted today really surprised Yaoniang. Before, Jin Wang would never say so much to her. The way Jin Wang was today seemed like he was enlightened.There was a sweetness in Yaoniang\u2019s heart even though he was acting domineering and unreasonable.\u201cShe is my brother-in-law\u2019s little sister!\u201d she whispered.Jin Wang snorted, \u201cPretentious, fake and uncultured.\u201dYaoniang had a strong urge to laugh and she did. This caused Jin Wang to snort again.When she looked at his face again, he had a weird expression and he seemed almost embarrassed. Yaoniang played with the corners of her clothes and whispered, \u201cCould this servant ask you something?\u201d\u201cAsk.\u201d\u201cWell, my sister knows what happened between us.\u201d Yaoniang couldn\u2019t help but cough twice. Then she whispered again, \u201cMy sister cares about me a lot and is very strict. She was furious while we were out and she said that you\u2026 If she does something offensive later, can you not hold it against her\u2026\u201dYaoniang\u2019s words caused one to have wild and fanciful thoughts. Jin Wang couldn\u2019t help but wonder about what her sister knew, how she had told her sister about it, and what her sister thought about him.But how could Jin Wang ask these sorts of questions out loud? He could only make a hmm sound.After receiving Jin Wang\u2019s reply, Yaoniang was very happy and said, \u201cThank you, my lord!\u201dShe was a girl who would not hide her happiness, anger, sorrow, or joy. When she was happy, one could easily hear the joy in her voice and see it on her face. There was also a very obvious grin on her face.But Jin Wang had never seen her show such a bright smile before.He had only seen her begging for mercy, being meek with no temper, and acting cautious, afraid of making mistakes.There had never been such a smile.Jin Wang suddenly had an inkling about why she didn\u2019t want to be given a status but was only willing to be a wet nurse. The way she is right now, not to mention Consort Jin, even Side Consort Hu could easily defeat her.At the same time, unpleasant feelings rose in his heart. Could it be that serving him made her so unhappy?Huiniang violently dragged Yan\u2019er into the East Chamber, and she saw Yao Cheng in the room.Yao Cheng looked at her with a bit of panic in his eyes.Inexplicably, he felt a little guilty.Huiniang glared at him fiercely, but for fear of scaring the three children, she dragged Yan\u2019er to the inner room. Yao Cheng chased after them. At that moment, Mrs. Li followed in from the outside and noticed a lot of people standing in the yard. She hurriedly shut the main gate and continued after Yan\u2019er.This was the first time that Huiniang, who had always been highly cultured and steeped in propriety, showed such a sneer on her face.Actually, this was not the first time. When Yaoniang had that accident, Huiniang also looked like this. To beg her to come back, Yao Cheng tried everything he could think of. Later, Yaoniang persuaded Huiniang, and only then did Huiniang finally come back.He looked at Huiniang worriedly, \u201cHuiniang\u2026\u201dHuiniang ignored him but took a deep breath. Yan\u2019er was still pestering Huiniang to let her go. Huiniang listened to her and let go of her, but Yan\u2019er wasn\u2019t ready and she fell to the ground.When Mrs. Li walked in, this was what she saw, \u201cSu Huiniang\u2026\u201dHuiniang looked at her, \u201cDon\u2019t point your finger at me. There are still so many people standing outside. If you are not afraid of embarrassing yourself, go ahead and make a commotion!\u201dMrs. Li immediately shut her mouth.Hui Niang glanced at the three of them and suppressed the discomfort in her heart. \u201cI know what you are thinking. If you don\u2019t mind causing trouble to the Yao Family, keep doing what you are doing. When something bad does happen, don\u2019t blame me for not reminding you!\u201dMrs. Li couldn\u2019t help but interrupt, \u201cWhat do you mean by causing trouble, this is a good opportunity. If the prince likes Yan\u2019er, our family will soar into the skies\u2026 \u201cHuiniang ignored her and turned to look at Yao Cheng, \u201cYou also think this way?\u201dYao Cheng was speechless.Actually, Yao Cheng did have these thoughts before. The appearance of Jin Wang was too unexpected. Once the incredulity fades away, his heart filled with excitement.Especially when Mrs. Li brought Yan\u2019er out, Yao Cheng wanted to stop her, in fear that Yan\u2019er would cause trouble in front of Jin Wang. But Mrs. Li pulled him aside and expressed her thoughts, and Yao Cheng couldn\u2019t help but be moved by her thoughts.Regardless of whether it was possible or not, it wouldn\u2019t hurt to try. If it really happens\u2026People would always indulge themselves in the world of possibility. Allow that sliver of delusion to expand into a major disaster. Yao Cheng was tempted, but he wasn\u2019t a complete fool. He found an excuse and left the scene, so even if Yan\u2019er messed up, he would have a way to retreat. Once he found out, he would come in to scold her and say that his sister was simply ignorant.The idea wasn\u2019t half-bad, but it was a pity that they miscalculated Huiniang\u2019s reaction.If it wasn\u2019t for Yaoniang, Huiniang would not say anything even if she felt disgusted in her heart. But the reality wasn\u2019t so, Jin Wang had come to the Yao Family for the sake of Yaoniang. How could this pair of mother and daughter get in the way?Hui Niang was a little disgusted with Jin Wang and felt that he had taken advantage of her younger sister. But she could do nothing about the relationship between them. It was already like this between Jin Wang and Huiniang. Since Yaoniang seemed to have an unusual affection for Jin Wang, how could she allow Yan\u2019er to intervene?!Yan\u2019er\u2019s behaviour reminded her of Chen An, Zhou Sheng, and her sister\u2019s current predicament. Who caused it? To put it bluntly, it was Yan\u2019er.\u201cAn unmarried woman, who\u2019s no longer a virgin and has a child, dares to fancy a prince. Not to mention whether the prince would even be interested in her, but even if he is, you\u2019d better keep it hidden lest a catastrophe falls on us.\u201dBut could it be hidden? Impossible! Almost everyone knew about what Yan\u2019er did.Mrs. Li was unreconciled. \u201cWhat ability does Su Yaoniang have to let a prince come to the door?\u201dTo put it bluntly, no one was a fool. Even if Fucheng\u2019s excuse was passable, it did not mean that they couldn\u2019t understand the hidden meaning.Men love sex, whether she was a widow or had a child, it didn\u2019t matter.These words were undoubtedly like a knife cutting into Huiniang\u2019s heart, but she refused to show weakness. She looked at Yao Cheng with a sneer, \u201cI have already said what should be said. I\u2019ll leave it up to you!\u201dYao Cheng did not hesitate for too long, and said calmly, \u201cYan\u2019er, stay here until the prince leaves. Stay in this room, you are not allowed to go out.\u201d\u201cBig Brother\u2026\u201d\u201cCheng\u2019er!\u201dYao Cheng looked at Mrs. Li with some irritation: \u201cWhat your daughter is like, you know in your heart that it\u2019s unlikely she will succeed. It\u2019s more likely she will fail and once the matter is lost, our whole family will have to pay for it!\u201dHe smiled bitterly and said to Huiniang, \u201cHuiniang, I was too greedy and I lost my head there for a bit.\u201dHuiniang snorted, turned her head and walked out. Yao Cheng followed in a hurry, trying to get forgiveness from his wife.The meal was ready soon and it was set on the square table in the hall.The dishes were very simple. There were seven ordinary dishes and one soup, all home-cooked dishes.Yao Cheng invited Jin Wang to sit down. According to reason, as the host, he should be seated along with the guest. But if Jin Wang didn\u2019t speak, Yao Cheng didn\u2019t dare to sit.Yaoniang was about to say that her brother-in-law could leave and eat elsewhere to avoid embarrassment. But Jin Wang invited Yao Cheng to sit and eat together.Not only Yao Cheng but also Huiniang.So a very weird meal began. Yao Cheng lowered his head and only looked at his bowl. Huiniang looked at Jin Wang from the corners of her eyes from time to time. Jin Wang was calm, but Yaoniang was in a cold sweat, frightened that her sister would speak up and cause Jin Wang to be angry.At this moment, the cry of a baby suddenly broke the silence. The sound was very sharp, which was different from the normal cry.Yaoniang\u2019s body quivered. She dropped her chopsticks and ran out of the door.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As Mrs. Li coaxed Hong\u2019er, she scolded Yan\u2019er \u201cWhy are you so fierce with that bastard? What if you scared Hong\u2019er\u2026\u201d\u201cWho asked him to pee at random times\u2026\u201d Yan\u2019er was still talking until she saw Yaoniang coming in and giving her a harsh look. Yan\u2019er quickly shut up.Yaoniang ignored them and hurriedly held Xiaobao to take a look.She saw that there was a red fingernail mark on Xiaobao\u2019s small arm, which looked like a lotus root. Due to the strength of the person who held him, his arm was slightly swollen and bruised. His skin was also broken.The little butt was wet, the pants were wet, and there was a large stain on the mattress. Yaoniang guessed that it was Xiaobao who had wet the bed and was pinched by Yan\u2019er. Of course, there was also the possibility that Yan\u2019er was in a bad mood and deliberately took her anger out on the child. Otherwise, she would not have pinched him so hard.\u201cYou dare to talk back to your mother and look for trouble? Scram! I couldn\u2019t even have a meal in peace!\u201d As Mrs. Li cursed, she winked at Yan\u2019er.Yan\u2019er was not stupid. In her heart, she cursed Xiaobao for being so squeamish. She turned and walked out, without giving Yaoniang a single glance.Yaoniang had never seen people bullying others like this. Two adults couldn\u2019t even watch over three children properly. Although Yaoniang had not been with Xiaobao for a long time, in the past few days she knew that Xiaobao was well taken care of by her sister. She takes him to pee regularly and he never wets the bed. It must\u2019ve been Mrs. Li and Yan\u2019er who were negligent and caused the child to wet the bed. Now, they have the audacity to disdain the child for being dirty.That wasn\u2019t even all. She actually dared to pinch Xiaobao like this!Looking at the red nail mark, Yaoniang was so distressed that she couldn\u2019t restrain herself. Her eyes were blood red.Xiaobao must also be in a lot of pain. He was still crying hoarsely even as she held him in her arms. He rubbed his face against her with an aggrieved expression.The child was wronged.Yaoniang\u2019s mind was blank. Seeing her sister coming in behind her, she thrust Xiaobao into Huiniang\u2019s arms and rushed over with a scream.Yan\u2019er\u2019s back was facing her, so she couldn\u2019t guard against Yaoniang coming at her. She only felt something heavy hit her and fell forward face to the ground.The fall completely befuddled her. Before she could react, she was slapped once after another, effectively stunning her.\u201cYou poisonous woman\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy are you so poisonous, he is still so young\u2026\u201dThe grievances, resentment, and indignation accumulated deep in her heart all erupted at once. Yaoniang, with tears streaming down her face, slapped Yan\u2019er over and over.If she had a knife in her hand, she wouldn\u2019t resist slashing at this person!\u201cSu Yaoniang, what are you doing\u2026\u201dMrs. Li didn\u2019t expect that Yaoniang, who was as meek as a sheep, would hit people. She was utterly shocked. Once she recovered from her shock, she saw that Yan\u2019er was beaten like this. Mrs. Li was furious.She put Hong\u2019er on the small bed and was about to go over and tear apart Yaoniang. Seeing this, Huiniang hurried over to drag her away. Xiaobao, who was lying in her arms, was so scared that he started to cry again.The room was an utter and complete mess with the sounds of screaming and the crying of children all mixed together.Mrs. Li pushed Huiniang away, stretched out her hand to pull on Yaoniang\u2019s hair, but was knocked to the ground before she reached her target.It was Fucheng.Fucheng did it without any guilt. He gazed at her with a smile on his face and said, \u201cThis isn\u2019t very good. You are already getting on in age, how can you get physical with others?\u201dWhen Mrs. Li looked up, Jin Wang was standing by the door with Yao Cheng at his side, face as black as ink. \u201cWhat are you doing?!\u201dHearing this violent shout, only then did the movements of Yaoniang finally stop. She stiffened her back and stood up.She didn\u2019t lift her head or look at anyone, but came to Huiniang\u2019s side, took Xiaobao into her arms and hugged him tightly.\u201cWhat in the world are you doing? Even with his highness Jin Wang here, you guys still act like this?!\u201dMrs. Li was not a person who would show weakness. She would cast the blame on others instead. Acting particularly righteous and confident, she said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask Su Yaoniang? Like a crazy person, she came in and slapped Yan\u2019er. My poor Yan\u2019er, look at the swelling on her face\u2026\u201dAs she spoke, she helped Yan\u2019er, who was lying on the ground, to sit up. After she saw Yan\u2019er\u2019s miserable situation, she screamed, \u201cSu Yaoniang, if you don\u2019t give me a proper explanation today, I will definitely not let you go!\u201dHuiniang would not sit back and watch her sister get bullied. She stepped in front of Yaoniang and said, \u201cWhat do you mean by giving you an explanation? Why don\u2019t you talk about how Yan\u2019er treated Xiaobao? How could she do this to such a young child?\u201dShe was so angry that her entire body was shaking. Yan\u2019er dared to do this kind of thing. Even without thinking too hard, she knew that Yan\u2019er was taking revenge because she had ruined her schemes earlier. If she had known that something like this would happen, Huiniang would have changed her way of doing things. Unfortunately, she didn\u2019t know something like this would happen.\u201cYao Cheng, see for yourself what your sister is like. Let me tell you, if there is no explanation for this matter today, I won\u2019t let your Yao family go!\u201dYao Cheng glanced at the shocking nail marks on Xiaobao\u2019s arm. Then he looked at the angry Huiniang. There was also Yaoniang, who was crying silently. Finally, his eyes landed on his mother and Yan\u2019er whose face was swollen like a pig\u2019s head. He could feel a headache coming up.But before he could speak, Mrs. Li bombarded, \u201cWho are you not letting go? Who are you not letting go of? Su Huiniang, talking to your mother-in-law like this, do you still have any dignity\u2026\u201dFucheng could also feel his head hurting. He couldn\u2019t help but look at Jin wang. Originally, he wanted to wait for his highness to speak, so he hurriedly stepped back. Yet Jin Wang only stared at Yaoniang\u2019s back. Who knew what was on his mind?Yaoniang patted Xiaobao again and again. Only then did he finally calm down.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He looked at his mother and then at the other people, arguing on the other side of the room. His eyes were ignorant, pure as the brightest star in the sky.Seeing such eyes, Yaoniang felt a stinging pain in her heart. She took a deep breath and shouted, \u201cEnough! Stop arguing!\u201dBecause her voice was too abrupt and a bit loud, everyone couldn\u2019t help but look towards her at the same time.Yaoniang, with a smile on her face, turned around and looked at Huiniang. \u201cSister, it\u2019s okay. You don\u2019t need to argue with them for me.\u201d\u201cYao Yao\u2026\u201d Seeing her sister\u2019s smile, Huiniang was a little dazed.Yaoniang looked at Yao Cheng again and bowed. \u201cThank you, sister and brother-in-law, for helping me take care of Xiaobao during this time. I will leave with Xiaobao. It was all my fault. We have caused you trouble this time. \u201cYao Cheng was at a loss and said, \u201cYaoniang, don\u2019t say that. It was all Yan\u2019er\u2019s fault. Brother-in-law will educate her\u2026\u201dYaoniang didn\u2019t continue to listen to his words. Holding Xiaobao in her arms, she walked out of the room with her head lowered.After she arrived in her room, she placed Xiaobao on the couch and began to pack her things.Fortunately, she had already moved out of the Eastern Chambers. Now all her belongings were here, including some of Xiaobao\u2019s belongings. Of course, some remained in the Eastern Chambers, but Yaoniang couldn\u2019t take everything by herself. She could only take the necessities with her.Xiaobao\u2019s things took up the majority of the space. After all, a baby needs to have his diapers changed every day.She packed everything into a bag and then began to change clothes for Xiaobao. Someone came into her room, and without turning her head, she said, \u201cSister, there\u2019s no need to say anymore. I won\u2019t let Xiaobao stay here any longer. You live your own life. Don\u2019t let me ruin your life.\u201dThe person didn\u2019t say anything. Feeling strange, Yaoniang turned her head and saw that the person standing in her room was Jin Wang.Seeing Jin Wang, Yaoniang was flustered. She didn\u2019t want to think about how he saw her shrewish behaviour nor did she want to think about what Jin Wang thought when he saw Xiaobao.She was a wet nurse. But now with a child in the picture, she couldn\u2019t continue to work at the prince\u2019s manor. Then there was also the relationship between her and Jin Wang. With Xiaobao in the middle, it would make Jin Wang uncomfortable.Despite knowing that it would be hard to survive out there on her own with Xiaobao, Yaoniang didn\u2019t want to ask Jin Wang for help. That would simply be asking for humiliation.She turned her head back and continued to pack her luggage, hoping that Jin Wang would leave as soon as possible.There\u2019s no need to say anything to her. She doesn\u2019t need his comfort. She also doesn\u2019t need a breakup fee. Just pretend that nothing had happened between them.Jin Wang furrowed his eyebrows as he gazed at her back. Then he looked over at the shuffling little boy who was lying on the bed.The bastard of that street vendor.No matter how Jin Wang looked at him, he wasn\u2019t pleasing to the eye.But-It was the first time that Jin Wang saw the honest woman being so angered that she resorted to showing her claws and biting people.The Yao Family\u2019s mother and daughter were not anything good. Jin Wang already knew a bit about it, but he didn\u2019t expect the current situation of this little nanny to be so complicated. He guessed that she didn\u2019t receive any less bullying on the other days when he wasn\u2019t here, otherwise she wouldn\u2019t have exploded so quickly.Jin Wang\u2019s face suddenly became cold. He had wanted to support Yao Cheng, but he had changed his mind.When he came to see Yaoniang, naturally he saw the little bastard who made him disgusted.Forget it, the manor was so big and had a lot of people. It wouldn\u2019t be a problem to raise a little kid.She wanted to return home because of this little bastard? If he swept away from her worries, would she never want to go home again?For some reason, such a thought suddenly popped up in Jin Wang\u2019s mind.He cleared his throat, \u201cWhy are you packing all this? When we go back, just buy new ones.\u201dHis tone was full of disgust. It seemed to express \u2018This prince is very rich. Yet you, a prince\u2019s woman, are so small-minded. You really lost this prince\u2019s face.\u2019Upon hearing this, Yaoniang\u2019s movements stiffened.\u201cWhat are you doing still standing there? Carry that boy with you and let\u2019s go!\u201dYaoniang slowly turned her head to look at him. Her eyes were red and her lips trembled. \u201cYour highness\u2026\u201dJin Wang frowned and looked at her. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? You want to leave the residence before you even complete your duties?\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201dJin Wang coughed. He turned around and walked out. \u201cFucheng, have her follow.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Fucheng, who stood by the door, hurriedly responded and walked in.\u201cNanny Su, look at\u2013\u201d Fucheng glanced at the infant lying on the bed. This was the first time that he looked directly at the child. Fucheng understood his highness\u2019s awkwardness, but to be fair, this child was extremely good-looking. As expected of Nanny Su\u2019s child.If Nanny Su could also give birth to such a beautiful child for his highness, Fucheng felt that he could wake up from his dreams laughing.\u201cWould you like me to carry the child?\u201d\u201cHow would this be good?\u201d Yaoniang hesitated.Fucheng smiled and glanced at Jin Wang. \u201cDon\u2019t let his highness wait too long. Nanny Su, you are probably not aware, but this is the first time that his highness has bothered to do so much.\u201dYaoniang blushed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The stone-like guards in the courtyard suddenly came to life and stood in front of them. Although Jin Wang had a cold face, he wasn\u2019t scary. Originally he seemed approachable and within their reach but now, he suddenly became unattainable.Yao Cheng sweated profusely but was blocked by someone who prevented him from approaching the West Chambers at all. Huiniang, who stood beside him, was silent. It was unknown what she was thinking.Jin Wang stepped out of the West Chambers. Without even looking at the two of them, he stepped into his grand carriage.The couple and Mrs. Li did not dare to speak at all.After a while, Yaoniang\u2019s figure appeared at the door. Huiniang couldn\u2019t help but yell, \u201cYao Yao!\u201dYaoniang came over. \u201cSister\u2026\u201d\u201cAre you leaving?\u201d Huiniang\u2019s eyes were on Xiaobao, who was lying in Fucheng\u2019s arms.\u00a0 She finally breathed a sigh of relief.Yaoniang nodded. She had thousands of words she wished to say, but she didn\u2019t know where to begin. In the end, she summarized everything into one sentence. \u201cHuiniang, you and brother-in-law stay healthy. When I have time, I will come to see you.\u201dHuiniang nodded and watched as her sister got into the carriage.It was not until they all left that she withdrew her eyes.She glanced at Yao Cheng who was standing next to her and went back to the house without a word.Yao Cheng\u2019s face was green and pale. Mrs. Li muttered about how Jin Wang changed his face so fast and didn\u2019t even acknowledge them. When she commented how Su Yaoniang, this slut, was ungrateful and treacherous, Yao Cheng exploded.\u201cYao Yan\u2019er must get married within a month, otherwise I will send her to Guzi Temple!\u201d\u201cYou unscrupulous wolf cub\u2026\u201dThe rest of the words disappeared when she saw Yao Cheng\u2019s resolute expression. Mrs. Li knew that her son wasn\u2019t joking this time and that he was serious.The carriage clattered along. Inside, Yaoniang sat next to Jin Wang and did not dare to speak.The carriage was very luxurious, with a complete set of appliances. There was a small stove in the corner of the carriage for boiling water and making tea.Once Jin Wang got in the carriage, he took out a book from a hidden compartment and leaned back on the soft couch as he began to read. Under his instructions, Yaoniang took out a teapot, a teacup and tea leaves from another hidden compartment. She waited for the water on the stove to boil as she prepared to make tea.The water finally reached a boil. Yaoniang washed the tea leaves with boiling water, and then placed them in the teapot.She poured boiling water into the teapot. The emerald green tea leaves scattered about, tossing and turning everywhere before they finally came to a stop. Yaoniang, picking up the teapot in her right hand, poured some tea into a teacup. Then she respectfully offered it to Jin Wang.Jin Wang, without raising his eyes, knocked on the table next to him. Yaoniang placed the teacup on it, not far from him.Both the table and the teacups were specially made. When the teacup is placed on the table, it won\u2019t move. The jostling of the carriage will not affect it at all.Yaoniang peered at Jin Wang\u2019s hazy face through the lingering smoke. For some reason, she remembered what Fucheng had said.Buried in her thoughts, she sat in a daze. She did not even notice Jin Wang looking up at her.Jin Wang knocked on the table with the book, interrupting Yaoniang\u2019s thoughts. It was unknown what she was thinking, but her face turned red when she looked up at Jin Wang.\u201cMassage my shoulders.\u201dYaoniang didn\u2019t dare to delay, so she hurriedly moved in.Behind the soft couch was the wall of the carriage. Yaoniang could only snuggle up next to him and massage one of his shoulders at a time.Jin Wang\u2019s shoulders were hard and strong. Yaoniang needed to put in a lot of effort to massage it. As she squeezed, her eyes couldn\u2019t help but land on a red mole, hidden behind Jin Wang\u2019s earlobe.She felt that this red mole was familiar. After thinking about it for a while, she remembered that Xiaobao also had one behind his ear.Both their moles were small and inconspicuous. They were dotted right in the middle of the back of the earlobe. If it was in the front, people would think they were wearing earrings.Yaoniang didn\u2019t take it to heart and her mind continued to wander. Her kneading alternated between light and heavy. From her technique, it was obvious that her mind was not on task. Jin Wang\u2019s eyes were on the book, but he felt an itch by his ears. Warm air was blown onto the tips of his ears, and a faint fragrance lingered in the air.Jin Wang\u2019s eyes dimmed. He turned to his side, and with his long finger, he lifted open Yaoniang\u2019s skirt. A moon-white dudou decorated with embroidered plum blossoms was revealed.Two different shades of whites shone beside each other, making her skin appear extra lustrous and fair.Yaoniang gave a light shriek and her hands tightened their grip.\u201cCome here and let this prince take a look. Have you recovered from that day?\u201dSpeaking of that day, Yaoniang was naturally shy.She wanted to refuse, but she couldn\u2019t help thinking of everything that Jin Wang had done for her. Jin Wang hadn\u2019t mentioned what she should do with Xiaobao yet. If she pleased him, would he let Xiaobao stay with her?Because of this thought and along with some instinctive obedience mixed in, Yaoniang leaned over.It could be seen that Jin Wang liked Yaoniang\u2019s suppleness very much. With his eyebrows raised and a mentality of tasting delicious food, he loosened the strings of her dudou. A beautiful scenery appeared before his eyes.When he saw the two pink and tender flowers, Jin Wang\u2019s eyes turned blood red.The bloody colour was not obvious. His eyes seemed bloodshot at first glance, but if one looked closer, it could be seen that they were different from the look of exhaustion.He flicked it with his fingertips, and the little flower hardened and perked up.\u201cThis prince is hungry.\u201dWith this sentence, Yaoniang blushed.~Trembling, she held it up and leaned close to Jin Wang\u2019s mouth.Jin Wang took advantage of her offer and caught it with his lips.It was like sucking on jade dew. All the pores of his body relaxed and his spirit was invigorated. Jin Wang\u2019s long fingers slid down and wandered around her waist, kneading and squeezing, pinching and rubbing. Yaoniang\u2019s entire body went limp.Yaoniang was a sensitive person. She was taught well by Jin Wang in her past life, and she was unable to resist his touchEspecially since this was not the first time for the two of them. Jin Wang was becoming more and more familiar with her body and knew what triggered her emotions. Only when she was moved could he perform to his satisfactionThe big palm slid under the skirt and removed her panties. As the panties travelled down her legs, Yaoniang\u2019s knees softened. But in the eyes of Jin Wang, she was forcing herself to straighten her waist.Satisfied, Jin Wang slid his palm up along her velvety thigh. The other hand covered her two globes of soft flesh, gently kneading them. At first, they were rubbed gently and slowly, but the force soon became heavier and heavier. With the slender fingers of the original hand, he rubbed against the land of the fragrant grass.After a while of kneading and teasing, the stream was already flowing.Jin Wang\u2019s hand moved south and he pushed his long slender finger inside deeper and deeper. Yaoniang couldn\u2019t take it anymore, and her breathing became heavy. Her eyes seemed as if tears were about to fall out. She wanted to go limp, but she feared he wouldn\u2019t like it. She could only hold on to the shoulders of Jin Wang, and whisper, \u201cYour highness, don\u2019t\u2026\u201d\u201cLook at how the water is flowing. If others heard you they would think I\u2019m forcing you.\u201dYaoniang clearly remembered that Jin Wang wasn\u2019t like this in her previous life. Yet in this life, for whatever reason, whenever they do such things, he would maintain a cold face and say such embarrassing words.She was a thin-skinned person. She wanted to turn a deaf ear to his words, but this time, Jin Wang didn\u2019t plan on letting her go so easily.\u201cHmmm? You want this prince to fuck you?\u201dYaoniang clenched her teeth and didn\u2019t speak. Unexpectedly, Jin Wang took a hand and pressed on her swollen clit, kneading and twisting it lightly. No matter how good her self-control was, her tender body still shook like chaff. She fell into his arms, and her little hand pressed against his large palm. She whimpered, \u201cYour highness, don\u2019t, I can\u2019t take this anymore\u2026\u201dJin Wang bit her earlobe then he slowly kissed and pecked it. \u201cWhat do you mean by not being able to take it? This prince remembers how tightly you sucked every time, for fear that this prince will come out. So enthusiastic.\u201dHe took her hand to cover his huge rod. The giant under her palm was hard and hot, Yaoniang shivered and wanted to withdraw her hand, but he didn\u2019t allow it.After this short while, his giant had already swelled. He gradually lost his composure, and his hand that was fingering her moved with more urgency and force. Yaoniang tried to clamp her leg together but was held back.\u201cSit up by yourself, don\u2019t let this prince serve you every time.\u201dYaoniang could only support her weak body, leaning on his shoulders, and straddling his waist.Holding onto his veiny and powerful rod in her small hand, she aimed it at her small opening. With a frown and furrowed eyebrows, she slowly pushed it inside.Probably because he disliked her for being too slow, Jin Wang held onto her pink buttocks and with one powerful thrust, he entered all the way.Yaoniang uttered a cry. Her body twitched and her heart trembled.And here Jin Wang was only getting started. With one hand on her lower back, and the other hand rubbing her full and fleshy globes, he began to thrust inside over and over with eagerness and ferocity. Yaoniang\u2019s beautiful eyes turned white. Her mouth was crying and screaming, but it was unknown whether it was from pain or pleasure.Jin Wang hissed in her ear, \u201cThere are people outside. With you being so loud, they can all hear it. Then it would be known that this prince acts indecently under broad daylight.\u201dDespite his words, his movements did not cease. He held up her pink buttocks and slammed them down again and again. As he pounded in, he hit that spot over and over making Yaoniang feel sour, numb, itchy and painful. Suddenly, she felt like she lost her heart and soul.But this time, she didn\u2019t dare to call out and she also didn\u2019t have the guts to bite Jin Wang. She could only put a finger in her mouth and clench her teeth.This was the first time that Jin Wang had done this man and woman act under broad daylight, surrounded by guards.To top it off, they were inside a well-lit carriage. She was as delicate as snow, her waist was like a thin willow, and her face was like a peach blossom. That pair of lovely jade breasts also bounced up and down along with his powerful thrusts.The giant under his body was squeezed and sucked in all directions by that beautiful hole. If it weren\u2019t for Jin Wang\u2019s extraordinary self-control, he wouldn\u2019t have held on for so long. Then how could he have seen such a gorgeous scene of a beauty being fucked till flooding water?\u201cWhat a little minx, this prince is about to die on you!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When she looked down at her clothes, they were neat and there was nothing wrong with it. It was obvious that she had been cleaned up.Jin Wang laid beside her, his eyes half-closed, as if asleep.She sat up and saw that Jin Wang was not awake. She went to the side and poured herself a cup of tea.Yaoniang was a little worried. Xiaobao was carried into the carriage behind them by Fucheng. She guessed that it was already afternoon, and she didn\u2019t know how Xiaobao was. Was he crying? Was he hungry?The more she thought about it, the more the fire burned in her heart. They were on the road and there was nothing for the baby to eat. He shouldn\u2019t have started bawling from hunger right?She looked at Jin Wang again. Seeing that he was still asleep, Yaoniang cautiously approached the window and tried to open it.They were still travelling on the road as expected, surrounded by a few guards riding their tall horses next to the carriage. Yaoniang tried not to think about whether the movements in the carriage just now were heard. She struggled to think of a way to ask about Xiaobao.She blushed and hesitated, but the guards near the carriage had already noticed her.The movements in the carriage from before were somewhat heard from the outside. Her gentle and charming cry tickled their hearts, but no one dared not mention anything. Now that a stunning face appeared by the window, the depiction in their minds was complete.One of the guards leaned over and asked, \u201cLady, what are your orders?\u201dThis was an honorific title. The concubines of Jin Wang have no official status but were generally called ladies. This lady was different from the others because she was a widow. But the young guard thought that if such a beauty was given to him, let alone a widow, even if she was a toxic woman, he would still hold her like the treasure of his palm.Yaoniang had no idea how she should phrase her question. How was she supposed to ask whether her son needed breastfeeding?Seeing her jade face turn crimson and her timid look, the guard knew what she wanted to ask. He cleared her throat and said: \u201cJust now, Eunuch Fu sent a message. Lady does not need to worry about the child.\u201dYaoniang nodded hurriedly, said thank you in a low voice, and lowered the curtains of the carriage.The guard looked at the lowered carriage curtain and felt a sense of loss in his heart.Yaoniang turned her head to see Jin Wang looking at her faintly, his face a bit cold. She also realized that she was not conforming to propriety just then. She hurried past him because she was afraid that Jin Wang would be angry with her.Jin Wang snorted coldly, and Yaoniang cautiously snuggled up next to him. She didn\u2019t dare to speak any flattery, but her behaviour showed her intent.Seeing such a coquettish and timid Yaoniang, Jin Wang couldn\u2019t get angry. He couldn\u2019t show his pettiness and how he couldn\u2019t bear to see her talking to other men. He thought to himself that tomorrow, he would throw that guard far away. To vent his anger, he kneaded her perky towers.In the carriage behind Jin Wang and Yaoniang\u2019s, Fucheng held Xiaobao in one hand. With a small silver spoon in the other hand, he scooped some coarse gruel from the bowl and fed it into the infant\u2019s mouth.The people that Jin Wang brought along this time were all big and rough men. It wouldn\u2019t be appropriate to let the boorish guards take care of the baby. If they caused the baby to wail and cry, Nanny Su would feel distressed and whine at Jin Wang. In the end, Fucheng could only condescend himself to babysitting Xiaobao.Ever since Jin Wang was entrusted with his own vassal state, Fucheng worked with one master above him and tens of thousands of men below him. When would he need to work and serve others? But he was used to serving Jin Wang every day and as a servant, his job was to serve people. Although his actions were a little clumsy at first, he was still competent.\u201cStinky little bastard, even you know that rice is fragrant and shit is stinky. When has your Grandpa Fu ever needed to take care of a baby? You should count yourself blessed!\u201d Although Fucheng\u2019s words were rough, his actions were light and considerate. He feared that the silver spoon would accidentally stab the child in the mouth, especially since they were in a moving carriage.How could Xiaobao understand this? All he knew was that he was hungry and that somebody was feeding him, so he behaved himself as he sat in Fucheng\u2019s lap. When Fucheng\u2019s silver spoon came over, he would open his small mouth cooperatively. The food was delicious, and he was as happy as a clam.Now that he was no longer hungry, he stopped eating as eagerly as before. A chubby paw reached out and rubbed against Fucheng, who then scolded him for it. Xiaobao didn\u2019t seem to realize or understand but gave him a toothless smile.How could Fucheng get angry at a baby? He simply shook his head when he saw it, poked his little nose with his finger, and said, \u201cLook at your lovely little self. If only your mother could give birth to his highness a plump and lovely baby like you. Then, not only would your Grandpa Fu feed you, you can even ride on Grandpa Fu\u2019s head to poop and pee. Your mother would also gain a better standing.\u201dXiaobao knew that Fucheng was talking to him. He blinked his eyes and opened his mouth, looking all curious and innocent. Fucheng laughed, \u201cWhy is Grandpa Fu even telling you all this? You can\u2019t even understand anything!\u201dOf course, Xiaobao could understand it. If he was a real baby, he wouldn\u2019t be able to understand it, but he was not.He lived for twenty years in his previous life. Ever since he was young, Xiaobao grew up in a medicine jar. He always thought that he had a congenital disease, but later, he learned there was another reason for his illness.Father Emperor only had him as a son. He knew that he had no mother ever since he was a child.When Xiaobao was very young, he was curious about what his mother was like. He asked his father, but he never said anything. People who knew his mother also kept their lips firmly shut. No matter how he asked, they didn\u2019t tell him anything. Later, after Xiaobao grew up, he secretly investigated and found out that his mother was already dead a long time ago.His mother was merely a little concubine of his father. She was gone when he was only over a year old. As for how she died, all Xiaobao knew was that she died fighting for favour in the rear courtyard. Xiaobao was a little skeptical of this result. Ever since he could remember, his father had a pure heart with few desires, like an ascetic monk. There were very few concubines around him. As for the few that he had, they were like decorations.Regarding this matter, the court would make some noise every once in a while, but his Father Emperor had a fist of iron. No one in the court dared to disobey him. As for himself, the sickly crown prince, he sat securely in his position until his hollowed-out body could no longer support him.Before he died, Xiaobao finally learned why his body was like this. It wasn\u2019t a congenital disease. He was poisoned when he was very young.At that time, his mother had died. He escaped by luck, but his body was damaged.To maintain his broken body, his father had searched for famous doctors and magical medicines and exhausted all his efforts. Yet, he could only save him for 20 years. By the time his oil was exhausted and the lamp was dry, his father had pinned his hope on ghosts and gods. Monks and Taoists ran rampant in the palace and the atmosphere was foul.Actually, Xiaobao had wished to tell his father to have another prince. But as he looked at his father\u2019s temples that had turned white and his cold face like ten-thousand-year-old ice, he couldn\u2019t say a word.In the end, Xiaobao died under golden light with sounds of scripture chanting in the background. He thought he was about to ascend to paradise. Yet when he opened his eyes, he saw a much younger version of his father looking at himself with disgust.Xiaobao was weak ever since he was young. He couldn\u2019t run or jump like ordinary children, he could only spend his leisure time reading books. He knew astronomy and geography, but he also read a lot of rural tales and folk stories.He thought to himself: Did he have a rebirth?He actually experienced a rebirth! He came back to the time when he was only a few months old and saw a much younger Father Emperor. There was also the old tortoise Fucheng at a younger age and a person who he suspected to be his mother.But his mother was not the concubine of Father Emperor. Others called her Nanny Su and he was also not the son of Father Emperor. Apparently, he was the child of his mother and a street vendor.After using his mind for so long, Xiaobao\u2019s small body was already very tired. Lying in Fucheng\u2019s arms, he stretched out his small arms and legs to block the spoonful of gruel that Fucheng tried to feed him. His little face showed a look of disgust.Fucheng laughed and scolded, \u201cYou little whelp is quite clever. Ok, I won\u2019t feed you anymore.\u201dXiaobao flipped over and yawned.He\u2019ll figure out everything eventually. Since God had allowed him to live again, he must take good care of his mother and no longer let his Father Emperor be lonely for a lifetime.Although Emperor Jin\u2019an had never told him, Xiaobao could see that his heart was as quiet as still water under his coldness. Maybe his mother was not as insignificant as others say, but was the unforgettable past of his father?With this thought in mind, Xiaobao fell asleep.Fucheng wanted to laugh and scold him again but seemed to be afraid of waking him up. Instead, he carefully placed Xiaobao on the soft couch next to him.Mini theatre:Xiaobao: I turned out to be the child of my mother and an itinerant peddler? ! Could it be that my father in my past life had raised his son in vain? (\u2299_\u2299)Jin Wang: \u2192. \u2192 Domineering President FaceYaoniang: (\u2299_\u2299) I don\u2019t know anything.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Right before the sky turned dark, the group of people arrived at Jin Wang Manor.Under the cover of darkness, Yaoniang went back to her small courtyard with Xiaobao.The small courtyard appeared to have been arranged a long while ago. Xiaobao was arranged to stay in the room where Yuchan lived, which was next door to Yaoniang\u2019s room. While they were still in the carriage, Yaoniang finally plucked up the courage to talk to Jin Wang about keeping her son by her side. Jin Wang had no objection to this, but his only condition was that Xiaobao could not live with Yaoniang.Yaoniang had a tacit understanding of Jin Wang\u2019s meaning. At least now, her son could finally stay by her side. In the future, she wouldn\u2019t need to worry about Xiaobao while she worked in the residence.The only issue was that Xiaobao\u2019s food would be a bit difficult to solve. Fortunately, Yuchan was not a random person. When Yuchan first came to the small courtyard, Yaoniang thought that Yuchan was here to serve the little princess. But after Jin Wang\u2019s visits at night, it was Yuchan who cleaned up the mess. Only then did Yaoniang understand why Yuchan had come to the small courtyard.Yaoniang had a plan. If she could feed her son, she would feed more. If worse comes to worst she would just drink some more milk soup in the future. If she wasn\u2019t free in the evening, she would ask Yuchan for help to feed him some rice gruel or something. Anyway, Xiaobao was already at the age where he could start to eat some of that stuff.Like so, Xiaobao settled down in the small courtyard as the son of Nanny Su.This was unprecedented. There had never been a wet nurse who could take care of her own child while working as a servant. But Yaoniang was not any normal wet nurse after all. She cured the little princess of her nightly cries and won over the hearts of Mammy Mu, Jin Wang, and even Consort Jin. Now she is the head of the little princess\u2019s wet nurses. It was likely that she would even become the little princess\u2019s future Mammy. By then, her job wouldn\u2019t be as simple as breastfeeding her.It was said that Mammy Mu pitied Nanny Su for her tragic life, so she agreed to let the mother and son enter the residence together. Mammy Mu holds an unusual position in the mansion and has the power to do this.After receiving the favour from above, it was reasonable to say that she would go to thank her. The next day, early in the morning, Yaoniang held Xiaobao and came to Mammy Mu\u2019s residence to see her.Nowadays, Mammy Mu has very little work to be done. She doesn\u2019t intervene in the affairs of the small courtyard. She designates it all to Yucui and Yuyan, and she rarely shows her face to others. Yaoniang couldn\u2019t help but guess what Mammy Mu was doing in her room all day. She learned that Mammy Mu spent most of the time in her room reciting Buddhist scriptures.When Yaoniang arrived, Mammy Mu had just finished the ceremony. She was covered in the smell of sandalwood and was still holding a string of Buddhist beads in her hand. Mammy Mu was dressed in plain clothes.She walked out of the small Buddha room in the back and sat down on the bed. Luyao brought over a basin of water to serve her. Mammy Mu took a sip of tea before she raised her head to look at Yaoniang.\u201cI\u2019ve let Nanny Su wait for a long time. This has been an old habit of mine for many years. I always dilly-dally like this in the mornings.\u201d Her words indicated that she did not mean to look down on Yaoniang.Yaoniang with Xiaobao in her arms bowed slightly, and said, \u201cMammy Mu, don\u2019t say that. It was Yaoniang who came at a bad time and disturbed you.\u201d\u201cNanny Su, sit.\u201d Then she ordered Luyao, \u201cServe some tea.\u201dYaoniang sat down on the chair. Mammy Mu asked, \u201cNanny Su coming at this time is because\u2014\u201dYaoniang was screaming in her heart. Mammy Mu most certainly already knew about herself and Jin Wang. To avoid embarrassment, Yaoniang acted according to protocol and said, \u201cThis servant is here to thank Mammy. Thank you, Mammy Mu, for sympathizing with this mother and son and for allowing Xiaobao to stay with this servant.\u201dFollowing Yaoniang\u2019s words, Mammy Mu shifted her gaze to Xiaobao\u2019s face, who was lying in Yaoniang\u2019s arms.The child was born with a good-looking face and it was likely that he would be a handsome young man in the future. It\u2019s unknown what kind of demeanour his parents had to be able to give birth to such a child. There was no need to mention Yaoniang\u2019s appearance, but this child did not resemble her. He most likely looks more like his father. It\u2019s a pity that his life is too bitter, that his father was gone before he was even born.While Mammy Mu looked at Xiaobao, Xiaobao was also looking at her.Xiaobao had a deep impression of Mammy Mu. Although she was only an old Mammy, she had a special status in the palace because of her extraordinary relationship with Father Emperor.In Xiaobao\u2019s previous life, Mammy Mu had always treated him kindly. He had learned about his mother from her. Unfortunately, Mammy Mu wasn\u2019t willing to go into further details. She said that there was no need for him to think so much and that he must maintain a peaceful mind and healthy bodyShe only mentioned his mother once, that his mother was a poor woman who lived a hard life.Xiaobao still remembered Mammy Mu\u2019s constant sighs and wringing wrists. Later, he learned that his mother was pregnant with his brother when she died. His father would order people to perform a ritual on the tenth day of the third month every year. There were two recipients for this ritual. One was called Su Yaoniang and the other was Erbao.It took him a lot of effort to learn these two names from the eunuch who was in charge of the matter.When Xiaobao came back to life again, this was the reason why he immediately decided that Yaoniang was his mother. There was only one person called Yaoniang beside his father. She could only be his mother.Thinking of this, Xiaobao\u2019s eyes darkened involuntarily. Although his face was still pretending to be innocent and naive, his thoughts had long drifted away.On the other hand, Mammy Mu looked more and more startled. She realized that Xiaobao looked a little like that person.Back then, Mammy Mu had watched the birth of Jin Wang. Naturally, she still remembers what he looked like when he was still in his infancy. She felt that Xiaobao and Jin Wang as a baby were carved from the same mould.Especially those long and narrow eyes. Those were the unique characteristics of the men from the Zhao Family. But when she thought about it again, all babies looked the same when they were young. They are all chubby, white and cute. She must have been muddle-headed to think that Nanny Su\u2019s son and his highness looked alike when they were young.Nanny Su was married. According to what she had heard, her dead husband was a street vendor.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

At the same time, she said, \u201cThis is nothing. I pity the parents of this world. You don\u2019t have any in-laws to help you. If the child stayed outside, you wouldn\u2019t be at ease when serving the master. In the future, do your best to serve the master. Then my efforts wouldn\u2019t be in vain.\u201dIf outsiders were to hear this, they would think that the master Mammy Mu was referring to was the little princess. But in Yaoniang\u2019s ears, the master she was referring to meant Jin Wang. Because of this, she felt a little embarrassed. She nodded and said that she would serve the little princess well, then she bid goodbye to Mammy Mu.Xiaobao laid in his mother\u2019s arms and his little mind whirled nonstop.Little princess? As in his father\u2019s daughter? But he clearly remembered that his father had no child other than him in his previous life.What exactly was going on? Were there still things that he didn\u2019t know?At these thoughts, Xiaobao gave a bitter smile. He knew too little about his mother and the life of his father when he was still living in his prince\u2019s residence. Few of the old servants had remained and this topic seemed to be his father\u2019s closest guarded secret. No one dared to say anything about it. It seemed that there was something hidden beneath the surface.Also, why did he become the son of a street vendor in this life? What happened?After thinking about it for a long time, Xiaobao still couldn\u2019t think of a reason, so he stopped thinking about it anymore.He knew too little about the outside world, so he wasn\u2019t able to analyze anything at all.In a daze, Xiaobao suddenly felt something being stuffed into his face. When he fixed his eyes on it, it turned out to be a mass of white.Xiaobao was utterly stunned. In response, he struggled desperately. His eyes shifted and his little head writhed. He didn\u2019t want to see it or eat it.His mother actually tried to feed him milk!Yesterday, to hide from this, he intentionally ate more rice gruel. But he didn\u2019t expect that his mother still had not given up on this idea.Yaoniang was sweating profusely. She stroked Xiaobao\u2019s back and touched his forehead, and muttered in a low voice, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you child? Why aren\u2019t you eating? Hey, eat quickly. Your mother is about to go to work. If you don\u2019t eat, you will be hungry.\u201dXiaobao turned his head, unwilling to face Yaoniang, but there was some inexplicable grief in his heart.What was his father doing? Why did his mother become a wet nurse? He, a dignified crown prince, had to condescend to hide behind others. This wasn\u2019t even the main point. How could a man at his age drink breast milk? Even if it was from his mother, he couldn\u2019t do it.Actually, because it was his mother, he couldn\u2019t do it.No one knew that Xiaobao\u2019s face was red because he was embarrassed. Even if they noticed his red face, they would think it was from him struggling so hard. Yaoniang also finally gave up on feeding him forcibly, and pulled the clothes up.\u201cIf you don\u2019t eat now, you can only have some rice gruel later,\u201d said Yaoniang with a worried expression as she looked at Xiaobao. Seeing that it was almost time for her shift, she hurriedly carried Xiaobao over next door. Then she handed him over to Yuchan.\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with this child but he doesn\u2019t want to drink milk. If he gets hungry, could you make some gruel to feed him?\u201dYu Chan nodded, but Yaoniang, who had been frowning, suddenly said, \u201cNevermind. The weather isn\u2019t as hot as before. I will squeeze some milk out for him. If he is hungry, feed him the milk. How can the gruel be nourishing?\u201d Once she finished her words, she hurried back and returned to her room.In the middle of her shift, Yaoniang came back and saw that Xiaobao had drunk the milk that she squeezed out.She breathed a sigh of relief. As long as he was willing to drink it, everything was fine. In fact, this saved Yaoniang a lot of worries. Otherwise, she would be afraid that Xiaobao doesn\u2019t have any food to eat while she works. Going back and forth would also attract too much unwanted attention. After all, she was working as the little princess\u2019s nurse.Xiaobao knew nothing about her complicated thoughts. He was forced to compromise because babies at his age mostly drank milk. Xiaobao was very protective of his current small body. He must not become a sick man in this life.In the afternoon, people from Siyi Courtyard came. Consort Jin had heard that Yaoniang was back and had brought her son into the mansion. She then sent her people to invite Yaoniang to come over and talk.Yaoniang took Xiaobao and went.When she arrived at Siyi Courtyard, Consort Jin was sitting on the bed, pruning a pot of begonia on the bedside table.Dressed in an autumn-coloured coat she looked slim with elegant and graceful temperament.It was inconvenient for Yaoniang to perform the usual greetings. She could only hold Xiaobao and bow. Then she stood to the side.Consort Jin was thoroughly preoccupied. Her small pruning shears shuttled a few times among the lush foliage, and the flower branches continued to fall. A basin of begonia, which originally had no shape, gradually appeared to be well arranged with her movements.She looked at it carefully before nodding in satisfaction. After she put down the pair of pruning shears, she had Zi Yan and others clean her hands. Then, she looked at Yaoniang and said, \u201cThis consort heard that you just came back. You have led a tragic life. Since your child is here, live well in the residence. You mother and son will not be mistreated.\u201dConsort Jin\u2019s attitude towards Yaoniang had changed ever since that incident. Even though she was facing Side Consort Hu\u2019s threats, Yaoniang hadn\u2019t betrayed her. After that incident, Yaoniang only saw Consort Jin twice. The first time was when Consort Jin bestowed her rewards and the second time was today. Consort Jin looked very amiable both these two times.Yaoniang did not dare to be neglectful. She had interacted with Consort Jin too much in her previous life. She knew that the other party was a person who always had a purpose when doing things.\u201cThanking Consort for her grace.\u201dConsort Jin nodded. She looked at the Xiaobao in her arms, smiled and said, \u201cThis is your child? What a white and lovely baby.\u201d She glanced at Zi Han, who immediately understood. She took out a golden necklace, walked up and handed it to Yaoniang. \u201cThis is the consort\u2019s reward for the child.\u201dMini-theatre:Xiaobao: (sorrowful face) Dad, what are you doing? Why did I become the son of a street vendor?!Jin Wang: (facing the wind in three feet of tears) I became a peddler somehow\u2026 I am also desperate\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She said with trepidation, \u201cYour Highness, this is too expensive.\u201dConsort Jin did not speak. Zi Yan, who stood at the side, said with a smile, \u201cNanny Su has a good character. With your hardworking and sincere attitude, you deserve this reward. Besides, this isn\u2019t for you, but for the child.\u201dWith these words spoken, Yaoniang could only accept the gift. \u201cThis servant thanks the Consort for the reward.\u201dWith Yaoniang\u2019s acceptance, it meant that she was now one of their own people. Zi Yan\u2019s attitude became much softer.Zi Han asked Yaoniang, \u201cNanny Su, what is your child\u2019s name?\u201d After receiving Yaoniang\u2019s answer, she smiled and said to Consort Jin, \u201cYour highness, look at how handsome this child is. He lives up to his name*. \u201cZi Meng nodded earnestly. \u201cYou don\u2019t say! Nanny Su is very fortunate.\u201dXiaobao was the main topic of the ensuing chatter and he garnered much praise from the servant girls. After a while, Yaoniang had the illusion that she had a good relationship with all of them. Consort Jin spoke very little from the beginning to the end, but she kept a smile on her face. She appeared to be someone who enjoys indulging her maids.When the consort was tired, she waved at Yaoniang to leave.Zi Han offered to walk Yaoniang out.At first, Yaoniang refused, but her refusal was not accepted. She could only walk out with Zi Han.\u201cNanny Su is very blessed. This is the first time that I have seen the consort treat someone like this.\u201d Zi Han\u2019s smile was very meaningful. \u201cBut there\u2019s one thing that definitely isn\u2019t false. Those who follow the consort would never be treated badly,\u201dYaoniang\u2019s eyes were in a daze. She lowered her head and said, \u201cThe consort is a good person.\u201dZi Han smiled and waved her hand, \u201cIt is also because Nanny Su\u2019s character is well regarded by the consort. I have never seen anyone else with this honour.\u201d She stretched out her hand and stroked Xiaobao\u2019s head, \u201cWhat a beautiful child. In the future, your mother will count on you. You must work hard to gain honour and distinguish yourself. Then your mother wouldn\u2019t have raised you all on her own in vain.\u201dSeeing that Xiaobao looked a little uneasy, Yaoniang patted him twice and smiled a little shyly. \u201cThe child is still young. Who knows what it will be like in the future? I don\u2019t need him to be outstanding. As long as he grows up safe and healthy, that\u2019s enough.\u201dObviously, Zi Han disagreed. \u201cNanny Su\u2019s way of thinking is not good. This child is a good seed. What he will be like in the future depends on the teachings of the adult. Like a small sapling, you must carefully water, fertilize and weed it. When the wind blows and the branches become crooked, you must straighten them so that the sapling can grow bigger and taller. These words may not be pleasant to the ears. But Nanny Su, you are a servant who waits on other people. Are you willing to let your son serve others in the future? Isn\u2019t it better for him to work hard and rise above others?\u201dWhat a good saying, rising above others!But what support was needed to get ahead? Obviously, it was not something Yaoniang can provide on her own as a wet nurse. Consort Jin and her people had said many good things about Xiaobao, all sorts of compliments. Which mother isn\u2019t willing to hear other people say good things about their child? Naturally, she would rejoice when she hears it. But when one is happy, they would yearn for more. Then, tips and suggestions would follow.No one hopes for their child to be a servant in the future. If she hadn\u2019t experienced everything in her previous life\u2026 If Yaoniang was a typical simple-minded nanny\u2026 Perhaps these people would have already moved her.What a pity\u2026\u201cThe consort really values Nanny Su.\u201dYaoniang\u2019s heart was as cool as a cucumber, but her face showed awkwardness. She hung her head and held Xiaobao tightly. Zi Han didn\u2019t say anything else. It wouldn\u2019t be good if she went too far. She walked Yaoniang out of Siyi Courtyard.Once she was far away from the courtyard, Yaoniang couldn\u2019t help but sigh and shake her head.She wasn\u2019t the sharpest tool in the shed, but even she knew that this piece of pie was too good to be true.The consort wanted to use her. The motive was obvious and the reward was Xiaobao\u2019s future. With a consort\u2019s backing, no matter what Xiaobao does in the future, he will have good support. But the premise is that Consort Jin must be willing to keep her promise and that Yaoniang must remain useful.But the problem was Xiaobao-Yaoniang looked down at her son in her arms, who was looking at her with his large eyes. She couldn\u2019t help but kiss him on his forehead. He was too cute.Xiaobao was only a few months old and there were still years and decades to come. What happened to the consort that caused her to be so desperate?Xiaobao was suddenly attacked by his mother. He automatically reached up to touch his forehead with his chubby hand.But it was a pity that with his small body, his arms were too short. With this cute action of his, Yaoniang was struck in the heart and she smiled until her eyes could no longer be seen. She stopped thinking about those messy things, hugged her son, and kissed him on the forehead. She teased, \u201cXiaobao already knows to be shy?\u201dWas he shy? Him? Shy? He, a dignified crown prince\u2026Fine, he was shy!Xiaobao was so embarrassed that he didn\u2019t dare to face anyone. He held Yaoniang\u2019s neck and buried his little face in her neck.It smelled so good. This was the smell of his mother.What Yaoniang had just said sounded in his ears-\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t need him to be outstanding. As long as he grows up safe and healthy\u2026\u201dThat empress from the Xu Family, who was under house arrest until her death, has a really big face. How dare she use him to instigate his mother!Seeing Zi Han walk out with Nanny Su and her son, Zi Yan couldn\u2019t help but sigh. \u201cI wonder if Nanny Su understands our meaning?\u201dIf changed to someone else, they would have understood long ago. But this Nanny Su was extremely stupid. No matter what the consort said, she would look ignorant. Zi Yan didn\u2019t know whether she was too stupid or too cowardly.Consort Jin smiled and looked down at her white and slender fingertips. \u201cYou really think she is stupid? She may not be the smartest, but that doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s stupid. If she is stupid, she wouldn\u2019t have been so stubborn that day. She knew that even if she pulled me in, she wouldn\u2019t have been able to protect herself. It\u2019d be better to rely on no one, remain neutral, and give others an honest impression. This consort also has to acknowledge her goodwill.\u201d\u201cBut if she understands, why is she pretending that she doesn\u2019t?\u201d Zi Meng asked, a little puzzled.\u201cThis is a dumb solution that only dumb people can come up with. With her self-awareness, she doesn\u2019t dare to aim too high. Unlike that one surnamed Hu, who is as stupid as a pig, but aims higher than anyone else. Under different circumstances, this consort would appreciate her prudence and honesty, but it\u2019s a pity\u2026\u201dUnfortunately, they were not under normal circumstances.Consort Jin desperately needed a helper. Someone who was valued by Jin Wang and serving at the little princess\u2019s side. Who else could it be but the beautiful Nanny Su? She was the best candidate.\u201cYour highness, is it true?\u201d Zi Die couldn\u2019t believe it. She couldn\u2019t believe that Consort Jin\u2019s own father would do this.Consort Jin\u2019s face darkened. She didn\u2019t speak, but stood up and went into the inner room.Zi Die hurriedly followed. Zi Meng looked at Zi Die helplessly, \u201cIt\u2019s already reached this point. How could it still be a matter of true or false?\u201d\u201cBut\u2013\u201d But the consort was her father\u2019s own daughter!Zi Meng knew what Zi Die was thinking without even needing to guess. She said, \u201cThe letter was sent by her highness\u2019s mother herself. How could it be fake?! Enough. You need to watch your mouth. Why can\u2019t you keep it shut? Always making the consort upset.\u201dZi Die touched her mouth aggrievedly and said nothing.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 88": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Jin Wang Dotes on His ConcubineCH 56.2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAccording to Xiaobao\u2019s memory in his previous life, Father Emperor had an empress, but he had never seen her.He only knew that the empress was the daughter of the Xu Family and was the former Consort Jin.Ever since he could remember, Empress Xu had been confined in Fengyi Palace and had never shown up in front of others. The Xu Family had also always kept a low profile and remained inconspicuous, unlike the typical maiden families of an empress.Xiaobao had always been puzzled about this. This kind of puzzlement had not been resolved even until his death. He thought it may have been involved with his mother\u2019s death, but he also felt that there was more to that. Empress Xu must have done something else to have angered his father or the Head of the Xu family had done something. But in the end, the empress had to take the fall. Otherwise, the situation wouldn\u2019t have been like this.Xiaobao laid on the couch and turned over.His mother had left to wash his clothes. The two things that made Xiaobao the most ashamed after his rebirth was that his mother continued to try to breastfeed him and that he couldn\u2019t control his urination.Pooping was fine. He could make noises to get the attention of others when he needed to go. His mother and Yuchan were both attentive people and they could understand.But urinating-Xiaobao has tried several times, but he doesn\u2019t feel any urges before he would suddenly pee.Yaoniang blamed this on the day Yan\u2019er had scared Xiaobao.As for this kind of reasoning, Xiaobao was embarrassed, but he was willing to believe it in his heart. Otherwise, after living for so many years, how was it possible that he couldn\u2019t even control his urination?But in the past two days, he has been learning to control the timing. From incontinence whenever he urinated to being able to gradually control it now and then. Now he could even call an adult whenever he needed to pee.Yaoniang realized that her son was getting more and more sensible. Now, he even knew to tell an adult whenever he needed to pee.Yaoniang walked in from outside with water droplets still on hand.It was noon, and everyone was eating. She took advantage of the break to wash her son\u2019s clothes.Yuchan didn\u2019t want to let her wash the clothes, saying that she mustn\u2019t damage her hands, but Yaoniang was used to this type of work. On top of that, Yuchan had to look after Xiaobao. How would she have free time? It wouldn\u2019t be good to have Yuchan take care of her own child and also make her wash his clothes. Looking after a child all on her own was already not easy.\u201cLady, let\u2019s eat.\u201d When there was no one around, Yuchan never called her Nanny Su, but Lady. Yaoniang had asked her not to call her lady several times, but she didn\u2019t listen. This was why Xiaobao concluded that his mother was his father\u2019s concubine. Yet he couldn\u2019t understand why his mother refused to live a life of wealth and honour as his father\u2019s concubine, but wanted to work as a wet nurse.When he first arrived, Xiaobao couldn\u2019t understand it. But after the trip to Siyi Courtyard, he gained a little understanding. This was most likely his mother\u2019s stupid way to protect herself. Working as a wet nurse, no one would think of her as a threat or plot schemes to harm her.But why did he become the son of a vendor? After Xiaobao\u2019s rebirth, the limited information he had learned told him that his father was not Jin Wang, but a street vendor.This was something he still doesn\u2019t understand.Yaoniang\u2019s meal was ready on the table but Yuchan had already finished eating.Yaoniang washed her hands and sat down at the table. While eating, she said to Yuchan, \u201cHave you eaten enough? If you haven\u2019t eaten enough, accompany me and eat more.\u201dYuchan shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m good. Lady, enjoy your meal. I will put some clothes on for Young Master Xiaobao.\u201d After Xiaobao had wet his pants, Yaoniang washed him but didn\u2019t put a diaper on for him. Yuchan was afraid that Xiaobao would urinate again and wet the bed.\u201cWhat young master? Just call him Xiaobao.\u201d He wasn\u2019t even a young master in the first place.Yuchan came to the bed, and Xiaobao, lying on the bed, was wiggling his fleshy little butt. It was unknown what he was doing. Yuchan was puzzled by these movements before, but then Yaoniang told her that babies at this age were like this. They would flip over and amuse themselves. Once they got the hang of flipping over, they would learn to crawl. After crawling, they would learn to sit. Then they would walk. Yuchan didn\u2019t need to interfere unless he was about to fall off the bed.Yuchan wrapped her hands around Xiaobao\u2019s waist and dragged him towards herself. She said, \u201cYoung Master, this servant will help you change your diapers.\u201dXiaobao\u2019s face was red with shame. To avoid being seen by others, he just laid there. Yuchan tucked the folded diaper into his waistband and turned him over like a pancake. Then she tucked the other end of the diaper into the waistband in front of him.Yuchan couldn\u2019t help but laugh, \u201cYoung Master Xiaobao is really easy to be shy. Lady, look at him covering his eyes with his small hands.\u201dYaoniang, who was sitting at the table, looked over and saw her son curled up like a shrimp. He had covered his eyes with his chubby hands. She had no idea what was going on in his mind throughout the day. She has never seen babies at his age be so sensibleThe two laughed at how cute Xiaobao was. Xiaobao\u2019s face turned red and he rolled to the foot of the bed to hide. Yuchan suddenly thought of something, \u201cMammy Mu asked me to tell you to pick a maid from the small courtyard to serve you.\u201dYaoniang was taken aback for a moment.Seeing this, what else couldn\u2019t Yuchan understand? After spending these last few days at Yaoniang\u2019s side, she could tell that she was timid and didn\u2019t like to attract others\u2019 attention. His highness and Mammy Mu also knew this, so they are probably planning a gradual approach.Yuchan continued with an excuse, \u201cShe would be this servant\u2019s helper so that you wouldn\u2019t need to pitch in and work nonstop.\u201dYaoniang thought about it. Yuchan was the only one looking after Xiaobao during the day and would most likely also get tired. It would be good to have a helper. But when picking the candidates, she hesitated. She subconsciously thought of Xiang Cao, but the relationship between Xiang Cao and Zhou Sheng\u2026\u201cThen Ah Xia.\u201d In the small courtyard, these two girls were the only ones that had a decent relationship with Yaoniang.Xiaobao\u2019s ears were perked as he listened to the adults\u2019 words and his thoughts wandered.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Ever since Xiaobao came to the small courtyard, Ah Xia liked him. She would come over to visit him every day. Looking after Xiaobao would be a very suitable job for her.Ah Xia was very diligent. Once she started her new job, she relieved a big burden for Yuchan and Yaoniang. Ah Xia was still a child at heart and could play with Xiaobao. A game that involved throwing a cloth ball could be played by the two of them for an entire afternoon.The cloth ball was made by Yaoniang. The ball was sewn with brightly coloured cloth and rags were stuffed inside to fill it. Now, Xiaobao can sit up without too much effort. Playing this kind of throwing game can exercise his ability to turn around as well as his hand-eye coordination.Seeing Xiaobao having such a good time, Yaoniang felt that making this ball was very worth it.In fact, this kind of small plaything was also sold outside. Most of them were made of wood or rattan. It wasn\u2019t easy to leave the residence, so Yaoniang could only make it herself.Her first ball turned out very successful so Yaoniang made two of them. One was for Xiaobao and the other was for the little princess.Xiaobao picked up the cloth ball and lifted his arm. He gave a light yell to remind the other party and then threw it out. To be honest, he felt bored to death inside. He also didn\u2019t want to play this kind of naive game, but he couldn\u2019t control his current body well. He could only learn to exercise slowly like ordinary babies.Xiaobao deliberately threw it off target. Ah Xia grinned and picked it up. After making a face at him, she threw it back.Yaoniang was sitting on the bed under the window, sewing clothes for Xiaobao.These few days she had been particularly idle. Side Consort Hu would come to the small courtyard every day. Who knows what the hell she was up to this time. Side Consort Hu would personally accompany the little princess to play. She would also feed the princess, shower and dress her, and even breastfeed her. The wet nurses\u2019 job was robbed. On top of that, she still remembered how Yaoniang didn\u2019t give her face before, so she would act all nice and kind while criticizing Yaoniang\u2019s work.After two days of being messed around like this, Yuyan secretly told Yaoniang to leave whenever Side Consort Hu came.So Yaoniang left whenever she arrived. She was completely at ease.\u201cThis Side Consort Hu is really annoying. That matter had nothing to do with Sister Su, but she always vents her anger on you,\u201d said Ah Xia while playing with Xiaobao.The reason why she said this was because Yaoniang had come back to hide from Side Consort Hu. To avoid offending Mammy Mu, Side Consort Hu\u2019s way of finding fault was to criticize Yaoniang for not serving the little princess well enough. Not doing enough here, not doing well there, not as good as her and so on.But according to Yaoniang\u2019s thoughts, this was Side Consort Hu\u2019s way to demonstrate her power. As the little princess\u2019s biological mother, whatever she says was right. Yaoniang also understood why Side Consort Hu was acting like this. It was probably because the consort was pushing her down so much that she couldn\u2019t hold her head up. She wanted to use the little princess to increase her own standing.Her actions also showed her motherly heart, which was for Jin Wang to see.In fact, the last point was the most important. It has been a long time and Yaoniang hasn\u2019t heard anyone talking about Jin Wang staying in Liuchun Pavilion. When talking about Side Consort Hu, they only used derogatory words. Of course, their words were mostly meant for Yaoniang to hear, but it does show the current attitude of the people working in the manor.After all, the consort was now in great power.As for the matter between Consort Jin and Side Consort Hu, Yaoniang has always been reluctant to get involved. She would avoid them whenever she could. So when Yuyan asked Yaoniang to leave whenever Side Consort Hu showed up, Yaoniang was only too happy to agree.But Yaoniang would definitely not tell Ah Xia this. She could only smile and say, \u201cThe side consort is the little princess\u2019s mother. It\u2019s normal for her to think that others aren\u2019t doing their jobs well enough.\u201dHer words resulted in different reactions from Ah Xia and Xiaobao. Ah Xia hated iron for not turning to steel, so she didn\u2019t say anything. But Xiaobao fell over after throwing the ball. No matter how Ah Xia teased him, he wouldn\u2019t get up.Xiaobao thought this Side Concubine Hu was really something. He had no idea where Father Emperor had gotten a woman like her from.In the past few days, to gather more information, Xiaobao would cause a ruckus every day to go out to play. It happened that Ah Xia was familiar with the people in the small kitchen. Whenever there was nothing to do, she would bring Xiaobao with her to the backroom to play. Like this, Xiaobao learned a lot of bits and pieces of information. The one who he heard about the most was this Side Consort Hu.Xiaobao felt that for such a person to survive, she must have been blessed by immortals. As for this immortal who didn\u2019t consider others, it must be his good father.When he thought of this, Xiaobao was reminded by the fact that his father already had a princess, but he was only the son of a street vendor. He was irritated by this thought.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dXiaobao was annoyed when he was picked up all of a sudden. When he looked up, he saw his mother\u2019s white and gentle face.\u201cAre you feeling uncomfortable somewhere?\u201dYaoniang touched her son\u2019s forehead then the back of his head. Xiaobao was very comfortable being held by his mother. All his annoyance immediately disappeared.So what if Father Emperor has a daughter? Even if he was the son of a dead peddler, he still has his mother! But Xiaobao continued to feel that something was wrong. He was definitely not the son of a street vendor because he looked 80% like Father Emperor when he grew up. There must be something wrong!Could it be that his father once lived among the common people for unknown reasons? Working as a street vendor for a period of time, then had a moving relationship with his mother? But his father didn\u2019t doubt his birth. He could only give him such a disgusted look if he believed that he was the son of another man.What was going on?Xiaobao really hated the fact that he was too young now to investigate what happened between his mother and his real father.That night.Hearing some movement, Xiaobao opened his eyes.There was the faint sound of footsteps and a light came on from outside the screen.It was dark so the light was very obvious.The door was gently opened, and Yuchan walked out quietly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The soundproofing of this house was not good, and the sounds from next door could more or less be heard. In his previous life, Xiaobao lived for 20 years. Although he had not been able to get married due to physical reasons, his father had tried to make him give birth to a son or daughter. Even if he wasn\u2019t successful, Xiaobao was not an innocent child,He knew what the movements meant. As soon as he heard it, he covered his ears with a quilt. As a son, how could he listen to his parents do that?His father came here tonight. Like those who have illicit relationships with women, he climbed into his mother\u2019s bed.This was not the first time. Xiaobao was already used to it. Yuchan would leave every midnight and come back soon.Xiaobao felt movement from beside him. Relying on the dimness of the room, he looked over and saw it was Ah Xia who sat up.Since Ah Xia moved in, a canopy bed has been added to the room. Xiaobao slept with Ah Xia on the same bed, so when Ah Xia moved, Xiaobao could feel it.But Ah Xia sat up for a while and then laid back down again. Not long after, Xiaobao heard the sound of Yuchan pushing the door and entering.Xiaobao thought this Ah Xia person was very interesting. Normally, she was innocent and always chattering, but sometimes her behaviour doesn\u2019t seem to match her personality.The room was quiet again.After thinking for a while, Xiaobao stopped thinking about it. He felt that his problems in his previous life had not changed. Since he was weak and couldn\u2019t go anywhere, he spent his time speculating on people\u2019s hearts. To be honest, after thinking about it, what kind of thoughts could a little girl have? Even if she did have certain thoughts, a finger was enough to press her to death.Next door, Yaoniang\u2019s long hair was scattered, half lying in the arms of Jin Wang.Jin Wang\u2019s jade-like face still showed hints of crimson. This was the aftermath of bliss. Yaoniang was out of breath. Until now, her breathing still wasn\u2019t even and her whole body continued to tremble uncontrollably.Jin Wang\u2019s desires were overwhelming. Yaoniang was still able to cope before, but now she felt like she lost half her life after every round.By the end, Yaoniang\u2019s entire body was trembling, unable to stop.Yaoniang hadn\u2019t encountered such a situation before. She was ashamed and embarrassed. It was too much for her both mentally and physically. She started to cry on the spot.Seeing her like this, a touch of remorse appeared in Jin Wang\u2019s eyes.He also knew that he had gone too far. But it seemed that once he met her, the beastly desire hidden in his heart could not be controlled and it surged up all at once. He had no scruples performing lewd acts and saying obscene language. Afterwards, when Jin Wang recalled it, he couldn\u2019t help but suspect whether that was even himself?But he also knew that men were very different in bed when compared to normal times. He didn\u2019t take it seriously, but today\u2026\u201cDon\u2019t cry, this prince won\u2019t be like this in the future.\u201dYaoniang ignored him and she continued to cry with her head buried in the blankets.Jin Wang looked at her and saw her black hair scattered around. Her snowy skin was red, and even slightly bruised. His heart was suddenly in pain. He held her up and saw that her head was still lowered. He stretched out his big palm and raised her palm-sized face.There were tears on her face. Her eyes were swollen from crying, and her entire face was covered in a rosy glow. Even her facial muscles were shaking uncontrollably, obviously because of how he had just tossed her.Jin Wang felt a flame rising in his body again and wanted to make love to her again.Push her down under his body and bed her!He closed his eyes to cover their bloody glint. When he opened them again, the room was dark. He stretched out his hand and stroked her face. As he held her in his arms, he stroked her back with his big palm to help ease the uncontrollable trembling.Yaoniang finally felt her teeth stop shaking and the tension disappear. She cried but was worried about Xiaobao next door, so she didn\u2019t dare to cry too loudly. She could only cry quietly.\u201cWhy are you like this?!\u201dAs soon as Yaoniang thought of Yuchan cleaning up the mess and seeing the traces left on the bedding, she felt suffocated. This man was too much. He had carried her behind the screen to clean up, and Yuchan came inside. But for whatever reason, his interest was sparked. When they did it again, she couldn\u2019t control herself and made a noise.Once she thought of all this, Yaoniang couldn\u2019t wait to bury herself in a hole and die.\u201cIt\u2019s all this prince\u2019s fault. This won\u2019t happen again!\u201d It was the first time in his life that Jin Wang had been so soft-spoken and humble. Even when facing the emperor, Jin Wang had never been like this before.But looking at her, she was so pitiful. He couldn\u2019t bear to be indifferent.In fact, during this period of time, Jin Wang could be considered to have understood Yaoniang\u2019s personality. She was a dough-like person. But dough-like people also had a temper. Being willing in her heart and expressing her willingness on her face were two very different things.She was so sweet when she wanted to bring that little bastard into the mansion. Sometimes Jin Wang even thought about putting her in his pocket and carrying her with him wherever he went. When he had nothing to do, he would take her out and play around. Even if they didn\u2019t do it, he would feel happy when he sees her caring for him.So why should he let her feel resentful?Right, that was it.Jin Wang said this to himself in his heart.As a result, his complexion softened and his tone was very soft, \u201cThis prince promises you.\u201d This was the best that Jin Wang could do.Yaoniang was very surprised but she believed it.\u201cReally?\u201d asked Yaoniang with her red and swollen eyes open.\u201cReally.\u201dYaoniang finally settled down and fell back. Under the caress of Jin Wang, her sleepiness surged up and she fell asleep.After he confirmed that she was asleep, Jin Wang laid her down on the bed.When he saw that she was not awake but was in a deep sleep, Jin Wang stayed beside her in silence. Then he got up, put on his clothes and left.When he came outside the small courtyard, he solemnly said, \u201cGo find Doctor Liu.\u201dThere was a faint sound of branches being moved by the wind, and Jin Wang walked towards Zhaohui Hall.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Since they are Jin Wang\u2019s hidden guards I called them Dark Guard Ten, Dark Guard Eleven, Dark Guard One, etc. but due to recent progressions, I feel that the story would flow better if I used their romanized names. I will be making edits to all the previous chapters. Sorry for the confusion.Under the dim yellow light, Doctor Liu\u2019s eyebrows were furrowed. He stroked his beard from time to time.The room was frighteningly quiet. Fucheng stood to the side with a solemn expression, as if there was a knot in his heart.After a long while, Doctor Liu released Jin Wang\u2019s wrist.\u201cYour Highness\u2019s eyes have recently felt uncomfortable under the light? Once the light is too bright, will there be an urge to tear up? Lust clouds your mind all day, and there are always beautiful thoughts? Once you bed a woman, you can\u2019t stop even if you wish to? And the thoughts can\u2019t disappear no matter what? \u201cDoctor Liu\u2019s last three questions were the most important even though it may be difficult for Jin Wang to answer. But doctors must look, listen, question and feel the pulse to diagnose their patients and they have to speak the truth. This was also not the first time for Doctor Liu to treat Jin Wang so there was nothing that couldn\u2019t be said.Jin Wang nodded.Seeing this, Doctor Liu frowned even more. He sighed, \u201cFrom what it looks like today, the poison is about to penetrate the bone marrow. If the antidote is not available, then within three to six months, Your Highness will fall into blindness. Your vitality would be drained then death would occur!\u201dWhat a vicious poison!In the beginning, when Jin Wang was first poisoned, he only showed symptoms of ingesting aphrodisiac. At worst it was more potent than ordinary aphrodisiacs.But the various signs of his body afterwards showed that the poison was unusual. It was also because of Doctor Liu\u2019s superb medical skills and wide range of exposure, that he recognized the poison to be Bliss Sanctuary. This drug had long disappeared from the market.This Bliss Sanctuary was developed many years ago by a gangster monk to satisfy his own lust. It has a miraculous effect on both men and women. When a man takes it, it will make the woman he sleeps with feel excited too.The same goes for if women took it.In the beginning, relying on this drug, countless women were imprisoned by this person. This monk was bold enough and even made moves on the female relatives of the imperial court officials. With the cooperation of the imperial court officials, the monk was finally captured. This person was beaten up, and the name of this poison has also passed on from the world.Even Doctor Liu did not expect that Jin Wang would be poisoned by this drug. But the symptoms were all there. Normally, he would behave like usual, but his lust would increase greatly. When it was the night of the full moon, he wouldn\u2019t be able to control himself. In the later stage, this poison attacked more frequently, until it led to the deficiency of yang then death.But this poison was not without an antidote. Since this drug was originally developed by an adulterous monk to satisfy his own lust, he naturally wouldn\u2019t entrap himself. There was also a kind of medicine that could counteract all the negative effects of this poison after taking it. Together, they have an indescribably wonderful effect on men. He could do ten rounds in a single night without a problem.After Jin Wang was poisoned, he ordered people to search for information about this drug. It took a lot of effort to find the notes left by the imperial officer who had captured the monk. According to the records, this monk was 80 years old but was still strong and vigorous. At the age of 70 years, his 18th concubine had given birth to a son.It\u2019s a pity that only this record was found. The descendants of this man have also been lost.After listening to what Doctor Liu said, Jin Wang was still as motionless as a mountain, but Fucheng lost his usual calmness.\u201cThis servant will go send a letter to An Yi to ask if he has found the antidote.\u201dJin Wang nodded, and Fucheng hurried away.After Fucheng left, Jin Wang asked, \u201cIs there any way to buy more time?\u201dDoctor Liu thought for a moment. He hesitated and said, \u201cSexual intercourse would work, but it is only a temporary solution.\u201dThe reason why he hesitated was that he was also clear about Jin Wang\u2019s afflictions. Those who knew the inside story would all call this drug vicious. It was pure evil to give a man repulsed by women this kind of medicine.\u201cUnderstood. You may leave.\u201dDoctor Liu nodded then left.Jin Wang closed his eyes and sat there, his slender fingers tapping on the arm of the chair.After a while, he said, \u201cSend a message to the capital. Fight by all means necessary! This prince doesn\u2019t believe that he doesn\u2019t have anything he cares about. As long as there is something, destroy it! Use his most cherished thing to exchange for the antidote!\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dOvernight, the rear court of the manor changed again.His Highness had gone to Liuchun Pavilion and stayed there overnight.Everyone was talking about it.For some discerning servants, this did not seem to be a surprise. After all, the little princess was still there. Side Consort Hu had used her to increase her sense of existence. As long as His Highness cared about his only daughter, he wouldn\u2019t completely abandon Side Consort Hu.The servants of the Liuchun Pavilion finally straightened their backs. Their attitudes have also changed from their earlier submissive state. Whether a servant had face or not depended on whether the master had power.Earlier, to help the Consort step on Liuchun Pavilion, the main kitchen had not prepared meals for Liuchun Pavilion on time for a long while. Whenever Meng\u2019er went to remind them, the main kitchen would always come up with excuses.It has only been a day, but the people have already changed their attitudes. When the people of the main kitchen faced Meng\u2019er, they didn\u2019t show an ugly face but wore bright smiles. They spouted pretty words and even stuffed her with fruits and desserts.Meng\u2019er picked up the food tray and went out of the main kitchen. After a long way away, she cursed, \u201cDamn those snobs!\u201dWhen she returned to Liuchun Pavilion, Meng\u2019er was full of pride. Facing Side Consort Hu, she described how the people from the main kitchen fawned on her.\u201cThose dirty people deserve a lesson. Only after Your Highness had slapped them in the face did they realize that Ma Wang has three eyes\u00b9. No matter what, because of the little princess, His Highness can\u2019t ignore you!\u201dSide Consort Hu curled her lips and smiled, her gorgeous face full of pride.But inadvertently, another sense of sorrow emerged. It was unknown what thought had appeared on her mind.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The maids\u2019 mouths were not as quick so they spent more time listening.Those from the small courtyard had received the news of Side Consort Hu returning to favour.\u00a0Mentioning this incident, she smacked her lips and said, \u201cI\u00a0just\u00a0knew that there is no way for that side to remain silent. There\u2019s still that one supporting them.\u201d\u201cExactly. She has the only child. If she gave birth to a son then she could\u00a0probably\u00a0completely suppress that side.\u201dThese women\u2019s words seemed to be vague, but everyone understood what they meant. Since servants can\u2019t discuss their masters, they could only resort to using pronouns.Several maids listened with gusto, including Ah Xia and Xiaobao sitting by the side.Mommy Zhao, who was one of the most talkative, saw Xiaobao looking thoughtful. She smiled, pointed at him and said to others, \u201cLook at this little thing, he seems to understand it.\u201dEveryone\u2019s gazes followed her finger and they laughed.As the only baby in the small courtyard, Xiaobao was very popular among the females.\u00a0Since the little princess was the master, with the Side Consort Hu and Mammy Mu at the side, they couldn\u2019t get too close to her.On the contrary, Xiaobao was the son of a wet nurse. The female servants could afford to be a lot more reckless because his identity was as one of the common people. It\u2019s normal to pinch babies\u2019 round cheeks and poke their chubby hands. There are even those unceremonious old ladies that like to kiss the cheeks.Who asked babies to be so cute?In this regard, Xiaobao was\u00a0deeply\u00a0disturbed and annoyed to death. It\u2019s a pity that he couldn\u2019t speak yet and he didn\u2019t dare to make any shocking actions. He could only suffer\u00a0bitterly\u00a0in silence.The bitterness was endless.A woman came up and hugged Xiaobao. She grinned and touched his pee-pee. \u201cLook at how good our Xiaobao\u2019s pee-pee grows!\u201dXiaobao\u00a0was stunned, his small eyes were blank.Several women laughed. One of them said, \u201cThat one should have a child on hand to catch his interest.\u00a0Perhaps\u00a0then she\u2019ll be more successful.\u201dThen someone said, \u201cWhat use is there to interest him? Without seeds, the field can\u2019t grow seedlings!\u201dThe women\u2019s words grew\u00a0increasingly\u00a0vulgar and it became more and more unbearable. Some of the maids seemed to understand but others did not. As for those who understood, their faces flushed, and those who did not look confused.Xiaobao understood and\u00a0was mortified. He immediately forgot about his pee-pee\u00a0being played by\u00a0someone. But these words also informed him that Father Emperor did not like that one from the Xu Family.But he wasn\u2019t surprised at that.\u00a0What did surprise Xiaobao was that his father, who\u00a0supposedly\u00a0stayed at the Liuchun Pavilion last night, actually came to sleep with his mother.Don\u2019t ask how Xiaobao knows, he won\u2019t say it anyways.What the hell was his father doing?Xiaobao furrowed his little brow.Jin Wang stayed at Liuchun Pavilion for five consecutive days. The servants were no longer shocked by that.Because they know that even if there was no sixth day, there would still be another first day and second day.Consort Jin was not surprised by this. When the maid reported it to her, she sneered. She couldn\u2019t help but wonder why that person hadn\u2019t arrived yet. The two of them can fight each other, while she sits on top of the mountain to watch the tigers fight.From then on, Consort Jin changed from her previous way of thinking.She was already like this. What else couldn\u2019t she accept? As long as she gave in to that person, she wouldn\u2019t lose her position as the main consort.But even with this way of thinking, it was still hard to accept.At last, the reward from the imperial court finally arrived. With this batch of rewards came several beauties.Regarding\u00a0the matter of how Jin Wang has no heir, it has been a burden on Emperor Hongjing\u2019s heart. After all, Jin Wang was his son, and one of the most outstanding of his sons. How could a Qinwang have no heir?But, Jin Wang has never cared about this matter.\u00a0On the occasions where he\u00a0was summoned\u00a0to the capital, he would come up with all sorts of excuses when Emperor Hongjing wanted to reward him with women.There has been a rumour in the capital lately that Jin Wang has no heir because he liked men, nor women. It\u2019s fine to like men. Many princes and nobles in the capital even raise boy toys, but it\u2019s a big problem if the man can\u2019t produce heirs.Emperor Hongjing thought that it wouldn\u2019t be good to go on like this.\u00a0He chose two young women from noble families in the capital and bestowed them to Jin Wang along with a few other beauties.The two noblewomen\u00a0were given\u00a0the titles of Side Consort. One was Liu Yan\u2019er, the di\u00b9 daughter of Marquis Ruyang, and the other was Xu Yueru, the shu\u00b2 daughter of Duke Xuguo\u00b3.Side Consorts\u00a0were recorded\u00a0into the genealogy of the imperial family and the two women\u00a0were bestowed by\u00a0the emperor.\u00a0It stood to reason that Jin Wang Mansion would hang lanterns and decorations to celebrate. The night of the women\u2019s arrival, the entire Jin Wang Mansion\u00a0was red\u00a0and bursting with joy. The servants were even bestowed wine and dishes in celebration.It was night. Lingbo Pavilion and Haoyue\u00a0Residence\u00a0were\u00a0brightly\u00a0lit. The Side Consorts\u2019 personnel were all looking forward to what was to come.This time, two side consorts entered the door together. They did not carry the sedan chair nor worship heaven and earth to enter the bridal chamber.\u00a0Whether they could ask for peace from the main consort the next morning and have face in front of Jin Wang\u2019s other concubines, would depend on where Jin Wang chose to spend the night.If changed to the capital, it would be impossible for two side consorts to enter the\u00a0residence\u00a0at the same time. But this was not the capital. It was Jinzhou.\u00a0Fearing rejection, as soon as the imperial envoy had finished proclaiming the imperial decree, the two women\u00a0were stuffed\u00a0into the\u00a0residence.The two side consorts were\u00a0extremely\u00a0embarrassed.\u00a0If it weren\u2019t for their many dowry servants, those who weren\u2019t in the know would believe them to be random nameless concubines.So whether they could earn back this face depended on where Jin Wang rested that evening.After all, they\u00a0were bestowed by\u00a0the emperor\u2019s decree. Even if Jin Wang didn\u2019t want to, he still had to put up an act. The two of them had also asked around before coming to Jinzhou. It wasn\u2019t that Jin Wang avoided women, but that he was busy with war all year round.Jin Wang Mansion has a side consort who is\u00a0heavily\u00a0favoured, as well as a little princess. It is\u00a0clearly\u00a0a rumour that Jin Wang likes men!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 93": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Jin Wang Dotes on His ConcubineCH 59.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThere was a happy event in the mansion. The masters had bestowed the servants with wine and food.The small courtyard also received its share.The emperor bestowed His Highness with so many women at once, and he couldn\u2019t even refuse. The servants of the\u00a0residence\u00a0were in a wild frenzy as they discussed the current situation of the manor.There were three tables arranged in the yard by the backroom. All the servants of the small courtyard who could come came.Yaoniang was also there.Everyone was drinking, but she couldn\u2019t drink. She\u00a0just\u00a0sat there, eating the dishes. Xiaobao was very obedient and sat on his mother\u2019s lap without making a fuss.Today, Xiaobao was\u00a0surprisingly\u00a0obedient. He has always been obedient, but he has never been so quiet. His little face was deep in thought and he looked very worried. His appearance\u00a0really\u00a0made people want to laugh.He couldn\u2019t help but peek at Yaoniang. He was afraid of seeing sadness on his mother\u2019s face.\u00a0Even though Yaoniang had a calm expression and\u00a0occasionally\u00a0talked to people, he thinks it was\u00a0highly\u00a0likely for his mother to be sad.After all, anyone would be sad if this happened to them. Now that his father gained more concubines, it was likely that he would rarely come to see his mother in the future.Xiaobao wanted to tell Yaoniang, don\u2019t be afraid. Once he is older, he will find a way to investigate the truth. Even if he was the son of a street vendor, it doesn\u2019t matter. He will definitely be outstanding and his mother can rely on him to live a lifetime of happiness.As night fell, the crescent moon hung high in the sky.The banquet\u00a0was cleared\u00a0away and everyone joined hands to clean up the mess. Yaoniang returned to her room with Xiaobao. Yuchan tried to take Xiaobao with her as usual, but Yaoniang shook her head. \u201cHe will sleep with me tonight, so you guys can sleep in peace.\u201dYuyan glanced at her\u00a0hesitantly, \u201cXiaobao is actually very obedient. He doesn\u2019t make any noises at night.\u201dAh Xia stood beside Yuchan and echoed, \u201cYeah, Sister Su. I don\u2019t mind sleeping with Xiaobao.\u201dXiaobao seemed to be afraid that his mother would give himself to Yuchan, so he\u00a0hurriedly\u00a0wrapped his arms around Yaoniang\u2019s neck.Seeing this, Yaoniang smiled and said, \u201cLook at him,\u00a0just\u00a0let him sleep with me tonight.\u201d She seemed to have something else to add, but she still didn\u2019t say it after a brief pause.Like this, Xiaobao\u00a0successfully\u00a0went into the room with Yaoniang.Ah Xia helped bring over some hot water. Yaoniang went behind the screen to wash, while Ah Xia helped Xiaobao wash.\u00a0By the time she finished washing and changing his clothes and diapers, Yaoniang was also ready to sleep.There was only one light on in the room. It\u00a0was placed\u00a0on the small bedside table, illuminating the bed.Xiaobao laid there as he watched her black hair hanging down her back, with a few loose wisps of hair at her temples. No matter how he looked at her, she was beautiful. Looking at his gentle mother, there was a soft warmth in his heart.He had a hard time ever since he was reborn as a baby who couldn\u2019t walk or talk and he would\u00a0inevitably\u00a0feel aggrieved. But Xiaobao was grateful from the bottom of his heart for having such a good mother.Mother, don\u2019t be afraid. You still have Xiaobao.Seeing Yaoniang sitting on the bed, Xiaobao\u2019s butt shuffled over to her side. Yaoniang looked at him in surprise. \u201cXiaobao is amazing. You can already crawl!\u201dExerting some effort, Xiaobao flipped over. Breathing\u00a0heavily\u00a0with his tummy up, he thought to himself: How was this crawling? It was\u00a0obviously\u00a0sliding. But Yaoniang was so happy that she picked up her son, kissed his forehead, and squeezed his chubby hand. Only after Xiaobao was blushing and pushing her away with his small hand did she let go.Yaoniang played a game of throwing the ball with him again. Xiaobao knew what his mother was waiting for, so he cheered up and had a good time with Yaoniang. Their laughter could even\u00a0be heard\u00a0in the next room.Yu Chan finally breathed a sigh of relief when she heard the laughter from that side.Nanny Su was a good-natured person.\u00a0Although she\u00a0was arranged by\u00a0His Highness to serve her, if she\u00a0was asked\u00a0to choose, free from any external factors, she would choose to be on Yaoniang\u2019s side.Ah Xia\u2019s eyes flashed, and her head dropped. It was unknown what was on her mind.The mother and son played for a long time until Xiaobao couldn\u2019t help yawning. Only then did Yaoniang realize how late it was.\u201cGo to bed. Are you hungry? Do you want to drink any milk?\u201dXiaobao was so scared that he rolled over to the other side of the bed, pointed his butt at her, and ignored her. Yaoniang thought of how she had fed Xiaobao a bowl of gruel and half a bowl of milk while they were eating. He should not be hungry\u00a0at this time, so she gave up the idea of breastfeeding her son.Yaoniang went to blow out the lamp and laid down on the bed, but she was not sleepy.Feeling a little person roll over, she immediately reached out and hugged him. With the moonlight, she could\u00a0faintly\u00a0see her son\u2019s sweet little face. Yaoniang couldn\u2019t help but shake her head and smile, throwing away all her random thoughts.What right does she have to think of all this in the first place? She was not his and he was not hers. Whether he favours the two new side consorts has nothing to do with her! Was it because she knew that he had never touched anyone since he had her, that she couldn\u2019t help but be greedy?Su Yaoniang, you shouldn\u2019t be thinking about all this!Caressing her son\u2019s warm and soft body, Yaoniang\u00a0gradually\u00a0fell asleep.At Zhaohui Hall, Fucheng kept looking at Jin Wang with his eyes.The only thing missing was rushing up to His Highness and asking whether he was going to Lingbo Pavillion or Haoyue\u00a0Residence\u00a0tonight.Fucheng had such uncertain thoughts because the two side consorts\u00a0were bestowed by\u00a0His Majesty. What kind of bridegroom wouldn\u2019t show up on his wedding night?What a pity that Jin Wang continued to read his documents. He even picked up the pen from time to time to make comments, not at all in a hurry.Indeed, the prince wasn\u2019t in a rush, but the eunuch was anxious to death!When it was finally haishi\u00b9, Jin Wang stood up but did not intend to go out. Instead, he went to the bedroom in the back.He changed out of his clothes and went to take a bath. Fucheng thought to himself: Okay, I guess His Highness doesn\u2019t plan on going anywhere. But Jin Wang put on his clothes again, and Fucheng was so excited as if he\u00a0was injected\u00a0with chicken blood. He couldn\u2019t wait to deliver His Highness into a woman\u2019s bed.When Jin Wang left the room, Fucheng wanted to follow him but\u00a0was stopped by\u00a0Jin Wang. \u201cDon\u2019t follow.\u201dNeedless to say, Fucheng knew where Jin Wang was going. He was going to find Nanny Su again. Who knows whether the two new side consorts will sleep\u00a0peacefully\u00a0that night. They will most likely be waiting all night.But who made Nanny Su\u00a0be favoured? His Highness was unwilling to miss out on even a single night. If he had to miss a night for whatever reason, it would stay on his mind as he looked forward to the following evening. Then he would rush over before the sky had even gone dark.Yaoniang was in a deep sleep but was\u00a0suddenly\u00a0kissed awake by someone.The visitor didn\u2019t deviate from his usual routine. While sucking and biting her lips, his hands rubbed and kneaded her. As he rubbed and rubbed, he grew impatient. He pulled open her shirt and began to explore.Yaoniang, still half-asleep,\u00a0subconsciously\u00a0wrapped her arms around the other person\u2019s neck in response. The lips and teeth of the two intertwined.\u00a0Their breathing became heavier and heavier, and the other person\u2019s thin lips\u00a0gradually\u00a0moved down, biting on her jade neck.\u201cYour Highness\u2026\u201d whispered Yaoniang, her body bubbling with pleasure.Jin Wang gave a hum, put one hand on the back of her neck, and fumbled downwards with the other.He was so excited that he couldn\u2019t hold back any longer. He loosened his belt and reached down to support it when he felt something was wrong. Why was there something beside him?In the dark, the blushing Xiaobao made two light hums. The movements of the two froze.Yaoniang wanted to scream but choked back the sound in her throat.\u201cXiao, Xiaobao\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Indeed, that little bastard was lying next to Yaoniang.Looking at the little boy with an innocent face and even rubbing his eyes because of the sudden brightness, Jin Wang stared at Yaoniang. \u201cWhy is he here?!\u201dYaoniang was\u00a0inexplicably\u00a0guilty. \u201cI, I, I took Xiaobao to sleep with me tonight.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t he usually next door?\u201d Jin Wang frowned, his face full of displeasure.Yaoniang\u00a0originally\u00a0felt uneasy, but when she saw him like this, a burst of resentment came up. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with taking Xiaobao with me to sleep?\u201d\u00a0This sentence\u00a0was supposed\u00a0to sound imposing but when she said it, there was no sense of intimidation whatsoever.Jin Wang snorted, grabbed Xiaobao by the collar, and walked outside with him.\u201cWhat are you doing!\u201dYaoniang\u00a0was shocked. She jumped from the bed without even bothering to put on her shoes and almost fell. After going out, she realized that the door was already open with Yuchan standing outside.Jin Wang threw Xiaobao to Yuchan and closed the door.When he turned and looked back at Yaoniang, Yaoniang felt\u00a0inexplicably\u00a0guilty. She had never spoken to Jin Wang in such a fierce tone before. She was about to turn her head and put on her shoes. She also wanted to avoid Jin Wang\u2019s stare.\u00a0Just\u00a0as she turned around, he wrapped his arms around her and lifted her.Holding back a scream, Jin Wang pressed her onto the table and thrust inside.Yaoniang\u00a0was unprepared, she almost couldn\u2019t hold back her scream. She covered her mouth with her palm as he rammed into her again and again.\u201cHe will not\u00a0be allowed\u00a0to sleep on this bed in the future!\u201dIf it was any other thing, Yaoniang would be willing to concede but not this. She gasped and said, \u201cI thought that you wouldn\u2019t come tonight, so that\u2019s why I let Xiaobao sleep with me.\u201d Her words\u00a0were spoken\u00a0in rebellion. Yet once her words left her mouth, they sounded soft with a hint of grievance.Looking at her little face, Jin Wang became interested. \u201cThen where did you think this prince would go?\u201dHow could Yaoniang concentrate\u00a0at this time? She\u00a0automatically\u00a0said, \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be at the two side consorts\u2019 place\u2026?\u201dShe only realized what she said after the words had already left her mouth.\u201cJealous?\u201d\u201cThis servant dares not.\u201d She didn\u2019t look\u00a0directly\u00a0at Jin Wang.Jin Wang hummed twice and raised his eyebrows, but his actions were harsh and heavy. \u201cSince you don\u2019t want this prince to find someone else, then you should serve this prince well. If you serve well, this prince will give you everything! \u201cYaoniang had already lost her soul to his pounding.\u00a0Except for the last sentence of giving her everything, nothing else registered in her mind.In the main hall of the Siyi Courtyard, Consort Jin sat in the main seat with Side Consort Hu sitting below her. As for Lady Li and Lady Tao, they weren\u2019t allowed to sit in a chair so they could only stand to the side.Two other people also stood below. They were Side Consort Xu and Side Consort Liu who had\u00a0just\u00a0entered the\u00a0residence.Yesterday, His Highness stayed in Zhaohui Hall all night and didn\u2019t go out at all. Everyone learned the news early this morning. Needless to say, these two guarded an empty chamber all night.With a dignified smile, the Consort Jin looked down at the two people below. Or to be more accurate, her gaze was on Side Consort Xu.Side Consort Xu resembled her mother, who was charming and lovely.\u00a0From the aspect of appearance, those who looked like that were\u00a0typically\u00a0simple and candid. But Consort Jin knew that this was all fake.\u00a0In terms of\u00a0shrewdness and pretentiousness, few people can outperform this mother and daughter.Consort Jin hates this kind of people the most. They disgust her to the point of nausea.But now, she doesn\u2019t think so anymore. The previous her must have not been thinking straight. Isn\u2019t the current situation pleasing to the eye? Peering down at her with a smile and seeing her in an awkward and embarrassing position. So long as she remains as Consort Jin, she would have to submit to her.And in this mansion, there are more than enough women to fight with her.\u201cSince you have entered the door, you are all people who will serve His Highness. Treat each other as sisters and help each other. This consort won\u2019t say anymore. The two side consorts who have\u00a0just\u00a0entered the\u00a0residence\u00a0probably\u00a0still have things to do. You may all leave.\u201dOnce Consort Jin disappeared behind the beaded curtains, the group of beautiful women dispersed.Lady Li and Lady Tao left very\u00a0quickly,\u00a0obviously\u00a0not wanting to get involved.\u00a0Side Consort Hu smirked, looked up and down at Side Consort Xu and Side Consort Liu and said, \u201cSisters, careful on the way back. I will take my leave first.\u201d She laughed and left.Whether it was her words or her actions, they all showed ridicule. Side Consort Xu and Side Consort Liu\u2019s complexion\u00a0instantly\u00a0turned ugly.But with another woman there, how could they show weakness to the other side. The two of them soon returned to normal. Side Consort Liu, who had an aloof and arrogant temperament, disdained all this. She raised her chin and nodded\u00a0reservedly\u00a0to Side Consort Xu, then left. Side Consort Xu\u00a0was left\u00a0standing there alone. Her face turned green then white. It was unknown what she was thinking.Actually, Xu Yueru already knew that this was a difficult path before coming over to Jinzhou.Consort Jin was the legitimate sister, born of the legal wife and has hated herself and her concubine mother all these years. There was no doubt\u00a0as to\u00a0how she would treat her. But Xu Yueru\u00a0was used\u00a0to being above others and was even raised as a legitimate daughter ever since she was a child.\u00a0She had forgotten that even if Duke Xuguo loved her, even if her concubine mother\u00a0was favoured by\u00a0the duke, her status as an illegitimate daughter would never change.The things that Duke Xuguo had done for the sake of her concubine mother that year have already made the people of the capital laugh\u00a0secretly\u00a0in their hearts. Who would put Xu Yueru in their eyes after that?She\u2019s reached the age of marriage, but her legal mother couldn\u2019t\u00a0be bothered\u00a0less. Although Duke Xuguo found some prospects for her, none of them were good enough.\u00a0People with high status disdain her for being of concubine birth, and her concubine mother is infamous in the capital. As for those men of low birth, she can\u2019t swallow the insult to herself.It doesn\u2019t make sense for her sister to be a consort while she marries a scholar of poor background.All the way until sixteen, her marriage has not\u00a0been settled. Not only was Xu Yueru anxious, but her concubine mother was also anxious. She begged Duke Xuguo to intervene.\u00a0After pondering over this matter for a while, Duke Xuguo finally revealed his plan to send another daughter to serve Jin Wang.Although Jin Wang doesn\u2019t\u00a0reside\u00a0in the capital, who doesn\u2019t know that among the vassals, Jin Wang and Yong Wang were the most powerful.\u00a0Holding hundreds of thousands of troops in their hands, even the imperial court has to give them some face.Regardless of why Duke Xuguo was eager to win over Jin Wang, long story short, the side consort of a vassal prince was a very good position for someone of Xu Yueru\u2019s status.Especially since Consort Jin was Xu Yanru.But the more Xu Yueru and her concubine mother thought about it, the more they believed it to be\u00a0feasible. Consort Jin hasn\u2019t given birth to an heir, it must be because she couldn\u2019t give birth. If Xu Yueru married over and gave birth to a son in one fell swoop, even Consort Jin would have to stand aside.From then on, the entire Jin Wang Mansion would belong to Xu Yueru alone.\u00a0Back then, since Duchess Xuguo couldn\u2019t give birth to a son, her concubine mother was able to elevate her standing and that woman\u00a0was forced\u00a0to bow her head all her life.Of course, hard work was indispensable to success but compared to glory and wealth, this was nothing. They weren\u2019t born into a life of riches so they could only throw away their dignity to fight and steal for it.Xu Yueru\u00a0was brought\u00a0up by her concubine mother ever since young, and her concubine mother has a great influence on her. As a daughter of a ducal family, even if she was born of a concubine, she could still be the main wife. Yet, she had to come and be a concubine.So Xu Yueru came over, with the belief that she was sure to win, but reality poured cold water over her.Jin Wang actually disregarded her. Not only her but also that woman Liu Yan\u2019er. For a man to not appear in the bridal chamber on the wedding night, what else could it be but disdain?In a short period of time, Xu Yueru thought a lot, but she was still unresigned.There is no man she can\u2019t conquer, it is\u00a0simply\u00a0a matter of means.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Side Consort Hu\u2019s unparalleled momentum was still the same as before.In the past few days, Liuchun Pavilion has been particularly lively. Side Consort Hu was paid respect by the women one after another. Except for Side Consort Liu, all the new concubines were there, including Xu Yueru.At first, Side Consort Hu didn\u2019t give Xu Yueru a good face, but for whatever reason Xu Yueru seemed to match her taste. After a few visits, the two of them even talked very happily.The people of the small courtyard couldn\u2019t keep up with the drama, there were new topics every day.On this day, Side Consort Xu came to visit the little princess.This was the first time she came to visit the little princess, and she was accompanied by Side Consort Hu. The two came to the small courtyard and saw the white and chubby little princess. Side Consort Xu spewed pretty words from her mouth one after another and made Side Consort laugh again and again.\u201cElder sister is really blessed. If I can also give birth to a little princess for His Highness one day, I\u2019ll be content for the rest of my life.\u201dSide Consort Hu thought to herself: Pfft someone like you? But out of her lips came hypocritical friendliness. \u201cYounger sister is fortunate. You can probably even give birth to a son for His Highness.\u201dSide Consort Xu also likes to hear these words. Holding back the urge to lift her eyebrows out of conceit, she said reservedly, \u201cGiving birth to a girl or a boy is predestined by the heavens. It\u2019s not up to us to choose but our fortune.\u201dShe wanted to humble herself and express that she had no desire to have a son. Even if she does have that thought in her heart, she would never admit it to Side Consort Hu. Otherwise, how could she have the opportunity to approach His Highness? But who knew that she would be misunderstood by Side Consort Hu.Side Consort Hu misunderstood what she meant. She thought that Xu Yueru meant that she was not fortunate enough and so gave birth to a small princess!This has always been a source of pain in Side Consort Hu\u2019s heart. If she gave birth to a body in one fell swoop, then there would be no place for these women. But she had to give birth to a daughter.There was no way for Side Consort Hu to change her face because of a single sentence. Side Consort Xu was still useful to her, but she didn\u2019t feel comfortable in her heart. Her glance fell on Yaoniang, who had her head lowered sitting to the side. \u201cNanny Su, why haven\u2019t you changed the diaper for the little princess? What\u2019s the point of having you all? If the little princess\u2019s buttocks turn red, and His Highness finds out, who knows how he will deal with you all.\u201d Her words were to show how important the little princess is to Jin Wang.Yaoniang was tossed around for most of last night. She was released only after she begged her \u2018good brother\u2019 for a long time. When Side Consort Hu came, she found a corner to hide, but who knew that she could doze off while standing. Hearing Side Consort Hu\u2019s words, a woman named Ji Ling hurried over to open the diaper of the little princess, only to find that the princess had not peed at all. It was Side Consort Hu using her for her usual tricks again.Looking at the jealous and envious Side Consort Xu, Yaoniang sighed in her heart and took out a clean diaper for the little princess to put on.However, the little princess has grown naughtier now that she is older. She didn\u2019t want to lie down, but to sit up. Yaoniang changed her to this position, but the little girl became interested in Yaoniang\u2019s hair. She reached out and grabbed a handful.Yaoniang snorted, and gingerly tried to pry away the little hand, trying to get her hair back. Side Consort Hu was unhappy and said, \u201cIf the little princess wants to grab it, just let her!\u201dYaoniang had no choice but to endure the pain. She lowered her neck and bent at the waist to change the little princess\u2019s diaper.When Jin Wang came in, he saw this scene. He frowned and wanted to say something, but he saw two women standing beside him.Side Consort Xu\u2019s eyes were sharp. When a figure came in, she hurriedly turned her head to look.\u201cYour Highness!\u201dSide Consort Hu naturally followed, feeling regretful for bringing Side Consort Xu over. To be honest, even she did not expect Jin Wang to come at this time. Otherwise, she would never do such a stupid thing.\u201cYour Highness.\u201d She came over with an ingratiating smile and bent at her knees to salute.Jin Wang had a cold expression on his face. He did not speak but looked at the cheerful little princess who was sitting on the bed and pulling on Yaoniang\u2019s hair.Fucheng naturally saw that scene too. He smiled and hurriedly stepped forward. \u201cHow can this be done? It won\u2019t be good for someone to get injured and for the little princess\u2019s hand to get hurt. Someone! Come over and loosen the princess\u2019s hand!\u201dIn fact, Yuyan had planned to do that a long time ago but was interrupted by Jin Wang\u2019s sudden arrival. Hearing this, she hurried over to help Yaoniang get her hair out of the little princess\u2019s hands. She pushed the princess gently to the side and Yaoniang went to the side to rearrange her messy hair.Side Consort Hu ended up bringing contempt on herself and felt very aggrieved.Her words to let the little princess grab her hair had just left her mouth when Fucheng rebutted her words by saying that it wouldn\u2019t be good for someone to get injured. Yet before she could explain anything, she felt Jin Wang\u2019s cold eyes fall on her. He snorted coldly, turned his head and left.\u201cYour Highness\u2013\u201d Side Consort Hu hurried out.Side Consort Xu stood there. It was unknown what was on her mind as she followed.But when she came out, she didn\u2019t see Jin Wang at all. She only saw a furious Side Consort Hu standing in the yard.\u201cSister Hu, where\u2019s His Highness?\u201dSeeing Side Consort Xu come over, Side Consort Hu quickly put away the expression on her face. She said with a smile, \u201cHis Highness still has official duties to do. He had come over to take a look at the little princess. Once he saw her, naturally, he would leave.\u201dSide Consort Xu nodded. For some reason, she suddenly asked, \u201cSister Hu, the one surnamed Su is a wet nurse?\u201dSide Consort Hu nodded impatiently. She was so upset at this moment that she didn\u2019t want to bother with this person.But Side Consort Xu gave a weird smile, and said, \u201cNo matter how I look at her, she doesn\u2019t seem like a wet nurse. Putting a wet nurse like her next to the little princess, sister, you are very tolerant.\u201dAt first, Side Consort Hu didn\u2019t understand her meaning. Once she got it, she was annoyed and looked at the other woman impatiently. \u201cThis person wasn\u2019t someone that I arranged for. It was your good sister who put her next to the little princess.\u201dSpeaking of Consort Jin, Side Consort Xu restrained herself and asked as if she couldn\u2019t care less, \u201cThe consort?\u201dSide Consort Hu sneered and nodded.Side Consort Xu glanced at Side Consort Hu. She seemed to hesitate, then said, \u201cIf it were her, Sister Hu would have to be careful. As her sister, I know her the best. She would never do useless things. Before she had married, she was proficient in qin, calligraphy, painting, and chess, but she was the best at chess.

Only when the others are in chaos can she take advantage of the other party. Yet she didn\u2019t know that with this single instigation of hers, Side Consort Hu\u2019s mind rippled.She couldn\u2019t help but think that every time Jin Wang went to Liuchun Hall, he would spend the night in the small building. Did the consort know that she\u2026Side Consort Hu\u2019s face turned ugly. Seeing this, Side Consort Xu smiled in her heart. Without bothering to go back with her to Liuchun Pavillon, she bid goodbye.Side Consort Hu stood there thinking for a while. Then she turned her head and went back to the small building again.\u201cNanny Su, are you okay?\u201d Seeing Yaoniang holding her sideburns, Yucui came up and asked.Taking her hand away, the area looked a little red.\u201cOh my! It\u2019s all red. I\u2019ll help you get some medicine for it.\u201dYaoniang held her back. Rubbing her sideburns with one hand she said, \u201cNo, it\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll be all right in a while.\u201d\u201cAnd the little princess too. Why does she always like to pull on people\u2019s hair?\u201d Not only does she pull on Yaoniang\u2019s, but also the other two wet nurses. Sometimes, even Yuyan and Yucui are not spared.\u201cChildren at their age are all like this. Even Xiaobao is also like this.\u201d But now Xiaobao doesn\u2019t pull anymore. Even if he pulled, it would be very light. It wouldn\u2019t be to hurt others but to catch the attention of adults. Sometimes even Yaoniang can\u2019t help but be surprised as she reflects on his behaviour. She feels that Xiaobao is actually a lot smarter and more sensible than other babies of the same age.At this moment, Side Consort Hu walked in from outside. No one spoke.\u201cSide Consort.\u201d A few girls bowed their knees to salute, and Yaoniang hurriedly stood up and bent her knees.Side Consort Hu nodded and sat down aside.The tea that was just served had been already cleared away because Side Consort Hu and Side Consort Xu had left. They could only remake it again.Yaoniang always felt that Side Consort Hu\u2019s gaze seemed weird. After the little princess was coaxed to sleep, she took the little princess from Yuyan\u2019s arms. But even with the little princess in her arms, Yaoniang still felt Side Consort Hu\u2019s eyes on her.Side Consort Hu felt that she was utterly blind. Her entire vision had been blocked by a single piece of leaf.She had always felt that this wet nurse was honest and not too outstanding, so she didn\u2019t take her to heart. But looking at her with a different frame of mind this time, all the hints were there. The wet nurse sure looks honest, but she also has a very good body.Look at her butt and breasts, protruding out in both directions. This was the most irresistible thing to men.She should know that bitch of a consort would not do useless things in vain. She had thought that she would be safe after getting rid of that slut, Cuizhu.Side Consort Hu\u2019s eyes seemed to have poisonous hooks, drilling directly through Yaoniang\u2019s cyan clothes.She was born in a brothel and naturally knew a lot of things that ordinary people wouldn\u2019t know. Women who have blossomed are completely different from those who haven\u2019t. Those who are well moisturized by men are completely different from those not well moisturized.As she gazed at the other woman, she saw that her complexion was fair with a rosy glow. Her skin was smooth and bright and her eyes had an irresistible charm to them. At first glance, one would be able to tell that she was moisturized very often.Side Consort Hu thought about how she had gotten up this morning to take a look at herself in the mirror. The woman in the mirror had eyes full of resentment. Her skin was still fair as before, but it lacked moisture. The corners of her eyes and the tips of the brows were all dried up like a well that lacked water. It has been a long time\u2026And because of this, the gaze she used to look at Yaoniang became more poisonous. But then she thought about it even more. If this slut actually had a relationship with His Highness, she wouldn\u2019t remain in her current position to suffer. Plus, when His Highness had just come, he didn\u2019t even take an extra look at this little slut.Side Consort Hu retracted her gaze. She planned to find someone to investigate this instead of only guessing and thinking about it.Yaoniang and the others could see that Side Consort Hu was acting a bit bizarre. She had sat down and drunk two sips of tea then left without saying a word.Side Consort Hu\u2019s weird gaze made Yaoniang\u2019s heart palpitate. Because of this, after she had put the little princess to sleep, she found an excuse to go back to her room.She took a look at herself in the mirror and felt that she was no different from before, except that her clothes were a little tighter. It seems that she has gotten a little fatter recently.Yaoniang has been very annoyed about her recent weight gain.She has to feed two babies by herself, so she would inevitably need to drink all kinds of nourishing soups every day. Her appetite has also increased a lot, which resulted in her body growing meatier.Her chest was much bigger than before, and the waist was also more fleshy. She thought that Jin Wang would definitely dislike her figure, but he actually felt that this was better than before\u2026Thinking of this, Yaoniang couldn\u2019t help but blush. Looking at herself in the mirror again, she felt that she had to remake her clothes to make them looser.That night.Xiaobao was sent next door to sleep.He had been very sticky to Yaoniang during this period. After Jin Wang had bumped into Xiaobao sleeping in Yaoniang\u2019s bed, he tossed her a lot that following night. Yaoniang didn\u2019t dare to challenge his patience anymore.In fact, Xiaobao deliberately adhered to Yaoniang so that he could see his father more often. Otherwise, as the son of a street vendor, how would he be able to see his father?Xiaobao\u2019s idea was to rely on his likable appearance, along with the fact that his father likes his mother, to be able to impress the other person. What a pity that reality didn\u2019t give him a chance at all. Just because of his identity as \u2018the bastard of the street vendor\u2019 was enough for him to become a thorn in Jin Wang\u2019s heart.Xiaobao was dejectedly handed over by Yaoniang to Ah Xia. Seeing such a son, Yaoniang couldn\u2019t bear it.Children all like to stick to their mothers, especially babies at his age where they only have a faint notion of understanding.She couldn\u2019t help but rub Xiaobao\u2019s little head, \u201cXiaobao, you can sleep with your mother tomorrow night .\u201dXiaobao glanced at her with his little eyes. How many times did she use this excuse of \u2018tomorrow night\u2019? Humph! Taking advantage of the fact that babies can\u2019t speak. He became even angrier, laid on Ah Xia\u2019s shoulders and ignored her.How could Yaoniang pay attention to all of this? She just felt guilty in her heart. After all, how could babies at such a young age understand such complicated words?She sighed and went back to her room.At night, Jin Wang arrived at the same time as before.The small courtyard was still and silent as usual.The moon hung in the night sky, but its light was not very bright. Hiding behind the clouds, it showed its face from time to time.A black shadow sneaked from the side gate of the back room all the way to the West Chamber under the cover of shadows. When she reached the northernmost room, she squatted quietly under the window.There was movement in the room. It wasn\u2019t too obvious from far away, but it was nice and clear up close.A woman whimpered, making a sound like crying but not quite, like laughing but not completely. It was followed by a man\u2019s faint murmuring and then the woman begged for pardon, \u201c\u2026good brother, have mercy on me\u2026 \u2026\u201dThe eavesdropper trembled with excitement. If only she could stick her chubby body to the wall, and poke her head through the window.But she didn\u2019t dare to implement these kinds of ideas. She only dared to listen like a cat with her ears perked. She thought to herself that this Nanny Su was really a slut, which she hadn\u2019t expected. She hadn\u2019t expected it at all!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Since the woman was carrying a light, she couldn\u2019t see her face, which made her especially scared. She fell to the ground and was about to scream when someone covered her mouth and dragged her away.An Shi, who was sitting on the roof basking under the moonlight, jumped off the roof. He looked at the dark and fat shadow beside Yuchan. Trembling in fear, she scurried back to Liuchun Pavilion.\u201cWhat do you think she would do?\u201dYuchan didn\u2019t bother to look at him. \u201cHow would I know? Why don\u2019t you go and see for yourself.\u201d After speaking, she went back inside.An Shi touched his nose. With a flash, the person disappeared.Tao Hong led the person in, and as she walked she said, \u201cSide Consort is waiting inside.\u201dA short chubby woman beside her nodded, rubbing her hands continuously. If Yaoniang was here, she would be able to recognize her. This person was a woman who worked in the small kitchen doing miscellaneous tasks and her surname was Xue. She was a lazy woman who didn\u2019t like to do her job but to argue with others. Mommy Mo tried to chase her away several times, but it was all in vain.It\u2019s also that Mommy Mo didn\u2019t completely want to chase her away. This Old Lady Xue has an ill husband and a son who was a good-for-nothing. The family relied on her to make all the money. If she was chased out, her family would not have a good end. So Mommy Mo could only turn a blind eye, acting as if she didn\u2019t see anything.On the couch by the window, laid Side Consort Hu dressed in bright red gauze and a pair of wide-leg soft silk pants. Her long black hair draped behind her and she covered her mouth with a slender hand as she yawned.She didn\u2019t even look at Old Lady Xue. \u201cSpeak.\u201dThen Old Lady Xue began to describe the scene vividly.Side Consort Hu, who had been lazing around, sat up straight halfway through. When Old Lady Xue finally stopped speaking, she asked with a strange look, \u201cYou are not lying to me?\u201dOld Lady Xue clasped her hands together and said, \u201cYour highness, with your orders, even if you gave this servant ten guts, this servant dares not lie to you.\u201d\u201cSo Nanny Su is having an affair and the person she is having an affair with is a guard?\u201d Side Consort Hu had given the orders to investigate, but normally with this kind of matter, it wouldn\u2019t be easy to actually find anything. She didn\u2019t bother to care too much about this, but merely gave orders for someone to listen by the wall at night. Unexpectedly, she discovered such a big secret on the very first day.But- a guard?As if she heard Side Consort Hu\u2019s doubt, Old Lady Xue nodded repeatedly. \u201cYes, he was a guard. As for who exactly he was, this old servant couldn\u2019t tell.\u201d Then she smacked her lips as if regretting not knowing who it was.Side Consort Hu creased her eyebrows and was curious. \u201cWhy are you so sure that it was a guard!? Did you see it?\u201dOld Lady Xue flushed with a bashful look and her eyes flashed before she inched closer. She whispered a few words to Side Consort Hu.She had thought that Side Consort Hu would be annoyed, and even if she was not annoyed, she would still scold her. Yet the other party was very calm as if she didn\u2019t feel that the words made her ears dirty. Thinking about the rumour in the mansion about the origin of the other party, there was a slight contempt in the eyes of Old Lady Xue.\u201cUnexpectedly, she is such a shameless little slut!\u201d cursed Side Consort Hu. She looked up at Old Lady Xue, and almost fainted from the smell of the other person\u2019s body. She covered her nose, fanning the air with disgust on her face, and said to Tao Hong, \u201cGive her the reward then send her out.\u201dTao Hong took out a silver coin from her sleeve and handed it over. Touching the heavy silver, Old Lady Xue smiled so wide that her eyes turned into slits, and she followed Tao Hong out.After a short while, Tao Hong returned and asked, \u201cYour highness, that Nanny Su\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s only a guard!\u201d Without guessing, Side Consort Hu knew where the guard was from. He must be someone working next to Jin Wang. Whenever Jin Wamg came to Liuchun Pavilion, he was always surrounded by guards. Maybe that\u2019s when that slutty nanny gets on with it with the guard.But on second thought, this Nanny Su was so dishonest. If she remained in the small courtyard, what if she seduced His Highness? After all, Jin Wang went to the small courtyard quite often, and she served the little princess. She would be like the waterfront pavilion getting the moonlight first.\u201cNo, this mustn\u2019t remain like this.\u201dWhen Jin Wang came, Consort Hu was still a little nervous.But Jin Wang only sat there, drinking tea as always, and Fucheng even offered him a book to read. Jin Wang started to read, without even glancing over at herself. Knowing that there was little hope, Side Consort Hu, who had been dressed up for the night, felt anger rising in her heart.But when her eyes fell on the other\u2019s handsome face, her anger suddenly disappeared. Instead, it was replaced with sorrow.Sure enough, after sitting for almost half an hour, Jin Wang quietly took Fucheng away.In the courtyard, guards stood in an inconspicuous corner like stone statues. At night, the entire Liuchun Pavilion was still and silent like a ghost town.In the middle of the night, a sudden scream sounded, and lights were immediately turned on.Guards moved extremely fast and rushed to the main room.The leader of the guards was about to order his men to barge inside when the door was opened. Tao Hong walked out and said tremblingly, \u201cGuard Wang, the Side Consort saw a dark shadow flashing by the window. His Highness asked you to take someone to go have a look.\u201d\u201cDark shadow?\u201dTao Hong nodded.At this time, Side Consort Hu walked out of the door. Her long hair draped behind her, but her clothes were neat.She angrily said, \u201cWhat dark shadow? It\u2019s an assassin! Why haven\u2019t you gone to check on the little princess?!\u201dAs soon as the little princess was involved, everyone couldn\u2019t help getting nervous. Guard Wang didn\u2019t bother to ask for details, but leading his men in a hurry, they rushed to the small courtyard.Side Consort Hu, who loves her daughter, was anxious and couldn\u2019t sleep at all. Ordering some guards for protection, she followed after them.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

All the lights were soon on.Everyone thought to themselves, what happened?Mammy Mu walked out of the room, followed by Yucui, \u201cWhat happened to make such a big noise?\u201dAt the bottom of the steps, Guard Wang clasped her fists and saluted, \u201cThe Side Consort said that there were assassins, and she is worried about the safety of the little princess. \u2026\u201d\u201cWhat nonsense!\u201dBut the people had already arrived, and Mammy Mu couldn\u2019t drive them away, so she asked Yucui to check on the situation of the little princess.Yucui went to the small building and shook her head to Mammy Mu when she came back. \u201cThe little princess is fine. Sister Yuyan and the two wet nurses are watching over her.\u201dSide Consort Hu said, \u201cThere\u2019s no way for this concubine to have seen it wrongly. Guard Wang, search every room. It\u2019s better to kill by mistake than to let slip, the safety of the little princess can not be neglected.\u201dSeeing Guard Wang standing still, Mammy Mu\u2019s face was gloomy. She gritted her teeth, \u201cIf something goes wrong, can you afford it!?\u201dGuard Wang glanced at Mammy Mu hesitantly, \u201cThis subordinate will order the people to search.\u201dWhile there was a flurry of activity outside, Yaoniang\u2019s room also had a lot of movement.Both Jin Wang and Yaoniang were at the key point, but Yaoniang was more sensible than Jin Wang. When she heard something was wrong, she started to push him.But Jin Wang ignored her. He grabbed her hand, pressed it over her head, and moved even more fiercely.Yaoniang was hammered so hard that she felt her soul leave her. She was clearly anxious in her heart, but she couldn\u2019t say anything. She had entered a trance again. When she came back to herself, she heard a bang bang bang on the door.\u201cNanny Su\u2026\u201dSomeone was calling her. She was so frightened that she suddenly quivered. After receiving the stimulus, Jin Wang couldn\u2019t bear it any longer. He uttered a muffled cry and gave her everything.Yaoniang was so hot that her heart trembled. It was too late for her to reply. She vaguely heard someone outside speaking and it seemed to have been a man\u2019s voice.Suddenly the knock on the door became more urgent and louder.While Yaoniang was still trembling from the excitement, she was also about to shed tears in anxiety. She wanted to push him away, but her whole body was weak.At this moment, the door was pushed open, and a series of footsteps came in.Then there was a scream.At the same time, the bed curtains were waved down by Jin Wang, and the beautiful scenery on the bed was hidden behind the curtains.Ahhh!There was a sound of exclamation and surprise, and one after another sounded.\u201cOh my! How vulgar!\u201dSide Consort Hu was the first to rush in. Although it was for only a moment, she still saw the situation on the bed. She saw Nanny Su\u2019s charming state from receiving dew, with her shoulders half exposed, and a man covering her body. It seemed that the dirty business between man and woman was suddenly interrupted.The man with his back facing them had a good figure, with extremely broad shoulders and well-defined muscles. The black hair at the crown of his head fell to the side with a kind of charming masculinity.Side Consort Hu\u2019s face flushed, and she said angrily, \u201cWho gave you such courage to have an affair in the prince\u2019s residence?! Shameless adulteress! Someone come! Arrest this adulteress, and this adulterer as well. Having an affair here in the little princess\u2019s courtyard is really offensive to public decency!\u201dWithin the bed curtains, Yaoniang was in a state of utter confusion and distress. Because of Side Consort Hu\u2019s insults, she couldn\u2019t hold back her shame.She cried softly and stretched out her hand to push Jin Wang, \u201cGet up!\u201dJin Wang glanced at her lazily, \u201cWhat are you afraid of?\u201d\u201cGet up quickly\u2026\u201dOutside the tent, Side Consort Hu was still scolding. At the same time, none of the guards she brought with her made a move.She turned her head to look and scolded: \u201cWhat are you doing still standing there!\u201dGuard Wang coughed a little embarrassingly, \u201cSide Consort, look at that\u2026\u201d\u201cLook at what\u2026\u201d Side Consort Hu looked over. Not only her, but everyone else also looked over.There was a floor-to-ceiling wooden clothes rack beside the bed, and a piece of clothing was hanging from the rack. The clothes were black, which seemed inconspicuous at first glance, but there was one golden place. People\u2019s eyes were automatically drawn towards the golden mass when they looked over at it.Although the golden yellow mass was in a wrinkled state, people could still see its shape with a single glance.It was a dragon.In the entire Dagan Dynasty, only the emperor and the princes could use dragon patterns. In the entire Jinzhou, there was only one person who could use dragon patterns.The clothes belonged to Jin Wang.Everyone turned their eyes to a pair of black boots that laid on the ground at random by the bed. The boots were also embroidered with dragon patterns!This was too shocking a reversal. They originally came over to arrest an assassin but caught Nanny Su having an affair, yet who would\u2019ve thought that the man was Jin Wang?Not waiting for everyone to return to their senses, a man\u2019s cold voice could be heard from within the bed curtains. \u201cScram! Bunch of dog slaves who don\u2019t have eyes!\u201dSo all the dog slaves scurried out but Side Consort Hu didn\u2019t want to leave. She was so scared that her face turned pallid and was dragged out by Tao Hong.Inside the bed curtains, Jin Wang turned over and held her in his arms. \u201cSee, isn\u2019t everything good now?\u201dYaoniang still felt that the sky had fallen. How could she notice Jin Wang\u2019s glee? Her mind was full of thoughts about how she was caught having an affair with a man and that the man was Jin Wang.What should she do? What should she do in the future? There was no way that she could continue to be a wet nurse. Was she going to repeat the fate of her previous life?Jin Wang still didn\u2019t hear what he wanted to hear after waiting for a long time. He couldn\u2019t help but think of many things from before, and his face suddenly became cold.\u201cIs it so unacceptable for you to admit your relationship with this prince? What, do you still want to preserve your chastity after the death of that street vendor?\u201dMini-theatre:Jin Wang: Feels so cute and beautiful.Yaoniang: So flustered, so hot, how come I was discovered!Jin Wang: Won\u2019t tell you. Won\u2019t tell you. The little nurse is so easy to cheat. Oscar should give me a little golden figure.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was not her that wanted to have a relationship with him in the first place. Today, she was caught having an affair, so she would have no face when going out to meet people in the future. Yet, he still treated her like this!Suddenly, all the grievances in her heart surged together and tears fell.He stared at her and furrowed his eyebrows. \u201cWhat are you crying for?!\u201dShe lowered her head and ignored him. She even tried to get up from him but was stopped by Jin Wang\u2019s hand pressing down around her waist.He stretched out his big palm and wiped her face, \u201cDon\u2019t cry!\u201dJin Wang\u2019s tone was too fierce and cold. Yaoniang\u2019s lips trembled with fright, and her tears fell faster. But she didn\u2019t want him to see her, so she stretched out her hand and covered her face in embarrassment. In a mosquito-like voice, she said, \u201cI don\u2019t know how to go out to meet people in the future, what should I do\u2026\u201dJin Wang snorted, \u201cNo one dares to laugh at you.\u201d\u201cSomeone will definitely laugh at me\u2026\u201d\u201cThis prince said won\u2019t, so they won\u2019t!\u201dWhile saying that, Jin Wang took her hand off her face. He sat up and took a random piece of clothing from beside him and wiped her face with it.Yaoniang was in pain from his wiping and she wanted to dodge but she couldn\u2019t avoid it. She could only sit there pitifully and let him wipe her face.\u201cTomorrow, I will let Fucheng choose a yard for you to move in.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not going.\u201d\u201cYou say that again!?\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d As she stuttered \u2018I\u2019 for a long time, Yaoniang played with the blanket she was wrapped in. Under Jin Wang\u2019s fierce gaze, she lowered his head and said in a low voice, \u201cI\u2019m afraid\u2026\u201d\u201cAfraid of what?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2019m just afraid\u2026\u201dJin Wang looked askance at her. \u201cThere is this prince to give you support, what do you need to be afraid of?\u201d\u201cI \u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cCall this prince \u2018good brother\u2019 and this prince will protect you and give you support.\u201dOriginally Yaoniang still held some uncertainties in her heart, but she instantly lost her breath when she heard this.These words reminded her of how Jin Wang had forced her to call him brother as he tossed her around the past few days. How could Yaoniang understand the origin of these lewd words? She only knew that she was too embarrassed. She only called him that when it was a critical moment or when she was forced to.But Yaoniang also knew that her situation would most likely not be good in the future. The matter between her and Jin Wang was exposed like this, and it would be spread throughout the entire mansion by tomorrow. Not to mention Consort Jin and Side Consort Hu, the two newly appointed side consort have not consummated their relationship with Jin Wang so far. If they knew that Jin Wang had been with her instead of being in the bridal chamber on their wedding night, they would hate her to the bones.Thinking about it this way, her breath hitched. She knew that the top priority should be to find a backer for herself, not to be arrogant.In her last life, she pleased him. Although he didn\u2019t like to pay attention to her, he did let her take advantage of his power. For a long time, others dared not offend her. He changed a lot in this life, and she could see how much he liked herself. If she pleased him well, would he treat her even better?After all, he was the most powerful person in the residence. If he really wished to protect someone, he should be able to do it.She didn\u2019t really care about what would happen to her, but now that Xiaobao was with her, nothing bad must happen. Anyways, she was used to being forced by him. It wasn\u2019t a big deal for her to call him that a few times.All these thoughts flew by in an instant. Yaoniang looked at Jin Wang anxiously and asked, \u201cReally?\u201dJin Wang looked at her and nodded.Yaoniang was so embarrassed that her cheeks turned scarlet. With her pretty eyes lowered, she slowly approached Jin Wang and whispered in a low voice, \u201cGood brother\u2026\u201d\u201cBe louder, this prince didn\u2019t hear it.\u201d Of course, he had heard it. At this moment, Jin Wang\u2019s entire body was so comfortable. It was as if he had eaten the immortal fruit that made people soar into the clouds.\u201cGood brother\u2026\u201dNanny Su, who served next to the little princess, had an affair with someone, and that person was His Highness. Side Consort Hu had wanted to catch them in action but was thrown out by His Highness.Before dawn, the news spread throughout the mansion, and people everywhere were discussing it in private.Consort Jin was dizzy and had to sit for a while after waking up before she could get out of bed. But when Zi Meng reported this incident, she was so shocked that her dizziness was gone.\u201cReally?\u201dZi Meng nodded. \u201cThe people below all described it in vivid detail. Apparently, people from the small courtyard were all awakened by Side Consort Hu at the time, so this matter couldn\u2019t be covered up. Some people who didn\u2019t go inside said that Side Consort Hu was so scared that she almost didn\u2019t leave Nanny Su\u2019s room. Even with all this happening, His Highness didn\u2019t come out of the room. After Side Consort Hu went back, she was furious and smashed a lot of things. One could hear her scolding Nanny Su from all the way on the other side of the mansion and she had used all sorts of vulgar language.\u201dConsort Jin\u2019s face was in utter shock. Then she started to laugh. She laughed so hard that her entire body shook. \u201cHaha, I really looked down on Nanny Su. I even regarded her as an ignorant and stubborn piece of rock but didn\u2019t expect her to have hidden deeper than we thought. No one in this mansion has an inkling when the two had even gotten together.\u201dAs she spoke, she also realized why. There was Mammy Mu and Jin Wang in the small courtyard. If the two of them joined hands and worked together it would be hard for others to notice.\u201cThen Haoyue Residence also knows about this?\u201d Haoyue Residence was the courtyard where Side Consort Xu lived.Zi Meng pondered for a moment, \u201cI guess they should know. This incident has been spread all over the manor.\u201d\u201cThen, they must feel uncomfortable.\u201dOf course, Side Consort Xu was uncomfortable. This matter appeared to have nothing to do with her but if one looked closer, they would be able to see the connection.The reason why Jin Wang didn\u2019t come to Haoyue Residence was that he got together with Nanny Su.Although she hadn\u2019t been here for a long time, she could still see what the people of the manor were like. Not to mention the other servants in the mansion, but the people around her were at a disadvantage whenever they went out because Jin Wang didn\u2019t consummate their relationship.She was supposed to be Side Consort Hu, the only one who received the favour of His Highness. That day, Side Consort Xu only said those words to provoke her, how could she have expected her words would come true?When has Side Consort Xu ever been this furious before? Because of her background, she wouldn\u2019t curse or scold but she was still so angry that she smashed her rouge box.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 100": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Jin Wang Dotes on His ConcubineCH 62.2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayOn Lingbo Pavilion\u2019s side, Side Consort Liu had always been arrogant and aloof, so even though she was surprised to hear this, she didn\u2019t say anything. With a cold snort, she waved away the subordinate who reported the news. As for what she actually thought in her heart, it was unknown.As they waited for the time to go to Siyi Courtyard to ask for justice, these women all had ugly expressions. There were even two new concubines who instigated at the side to have Consort Jin take the initiative to punish Nanny Su who climbed the bed.But would Consort Jin listen to them?That would be strange.While there was a lot of discussion about this matter in the mansion, Zhaohui Hall also made arrangements for Yaoniang at an extremely fast speed.Fucheng\u2019s work efficiency was amazing. He quickly picked a courtyard behind the east side of Zhaohui Hall as the courtyard for Yaoniang to live in.This yard was not in the centre of the residence but was on the east side. It is, however, very close to Zhaohui Hall, which would make it convenient for Jin Wang to go there in the future. It must be said that Fucheng was quite dedicated.Not only that, but the efficiency of the Internal Affairs Office was also not bad. In a single morning, Rongxi Courtyard was properly arranged with everything inside. Even the maids and servants were all ready, waiting for the master to move in.Yaoniang was too embarrassed to see people. Taking advantage of noontime when everyone was busy with lunch, she quietly went to Rongxi Courtyard with Xiaobao, Yuchan, and Ah XiaRongxi Courtyard was spacious and elegant, with five main rooms facing each other. There were side rooms and wing rooms on both sides and the front and back cover rooms embraced the building. With carved beams and painted rafters, the courtyard looked magnificent.The courtyard was large, verdant and lush, with exquisite mountains and rocks. It was planted with famous and exotic plants, all blooming beautifully. On the right side, there were two pink apricot trees and a lush pomegranate tree. There were also stone tables and stools under the trees. If it was summer, this would be a good place to enjoy the shade.Entering the main hall, there was a floor-to-ceiling cover with four thousand characters written on it. There was also an antique shelf on which various rare and exotic treasures were placed.Next to the bedroom was the east room, where there was a Luohan bed under the window. There was a brocade mattress on it and a few cushions covered in shiny satin. Next to it was a small rosewood table, and an incense burner was placed on it. Beside the table was a rosewood cabinet, and on the other side were two armchairs and a flower table.The bedroom was very large. Inside was a rosewood babu bed with carvings of flowing clouds with thousands of lotus carps. The bed was covered with a golden satin mattress, which looked soft and comfortable. There was also a dressing table, a wooden clothes rack and other things. Behind the screen, embroidered with flowers from all four seasons, seemed to be the bathroom.Yaoniang was led to sit down in the main hall. A group of over a dozen girls walked in from the outside with their heads lowered and they all knelt.\u201cThis maid greets the Lady.\u201dYaoniang was taken aback. She was also a lady in her previous life but was a lady arranged by Consort Jin.Said to be a lady, but was actually a concubine.At that time, she depended on the consort, and because of her poor background, she was also timid and cowardly. Although there were a lot of maids and servants around her, she had never put on her airs in front of the servants. She had never been kneeled to like this before.She wanted to stand up but was gently pressed down by Yuchan from behind.Yaoniang was not stupid, she understood Yuchan\u2019s meaning. She sat in the chair, thinking about the consort\u2019s usual manner when facing her servants, and slowly said, \u201cYou may all rise.\u201dOne could see that Yaoniang was very embarrassed. Yuchan sighed in her heart and spoke for her, \u201cThe Lady is overjoyed today, so there will be rewards for everyone. You may all go down first. Those named Hong, stay.\u201dThen all the maids retreated, except for four girls in blue.These four girls were not very old. They were only about 13 or 14 years old with small, fair faces, standing upright. With only one look, it was obvious that these four girls were well-trained.\u201cLady, their names are Hong Chou, Hong Yan, Hong Die, and Hong Fei. From now on, the four of them will serve by your side.\u201dYaoniang nodded.Yuchan said again, \u201cAs for the young master, what do you think about arranging him to live in the West Chamber? Ah Xia will wait on him and there are also two maids and a wet nurse.\u201dYaoniang was more concerned about Xiaobao than herself. After asking about the specific situation, she went to the West Chamber to take a look.Seeing that the room was decorated beautifully without withholding any extravagance and all aspects were taken care of, she felt relieved. After that, she told everyone to retreat, then she rested in the room with Xiaobao in her arms.That was what she said, but how could she fall asleep?Xiaobao was lying on the new bed with his soft and fragrant beloved mother. He looked at her distressingly.At this moment, his dissatisfaction with Jin Wang reached its peak. To force his mother to retreat and expose the matter, he used this method. Although Xiaobao didn\u2019t know the specifics, he could tell by just guessing that there was no way for someone like Side Consort Hu to catch his father in the act on his mother\u2019s bed. He didn\u2019t believe that his father had nothing to do with this.He stretched out his little hand and patted Yaoniang\u2019s leg twice. He intended to comfort her, but Yaoniang misunderstood that her son was unhappy when he saw that she ignored him.\u201cXiaobao, be good, go to bed. When you wake up, mother will play with you.\u201d Then, she laid down beside Xiaobao, wrapped her arms around her son, and patted his back with her hands.Xiaobao also lay there obediently. Compared to before, he could now accept Yaoniang\u2019s intimacy with ease.Mother smelled very nice and her hands were very soft. Xiaobao was sleepy.At this moment, he heard Yaoniang suddenly say, \u201cNo matter what, mother will not die in this life. With that domineering temperament of his, he can not tolerate the disobedience of others. As long as mother caters to him, he will protect us\u2026\u201dXiaobao was agitated, and his sleepiness suddenly disappeared. Yet, Yaoniang didn\u2019t move anymore and she looked like she was asleep.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
