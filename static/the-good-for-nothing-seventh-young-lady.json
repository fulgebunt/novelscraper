With strenuous effort in opening up her pair of sore eyes, it was then accompanied with a faint bright light and an ear piercing sound revolving around her ears.\u201cIf oneself does not have the ability, one should not blame others. The time around, she is very lucky and is able to be saved but she will certainly not have this kind of a luck the next time.\u201d\u201cA trash should have the awareness of being a trash. This is truly throwing our family\u2019s face to the greatest extent that one is still acting recklessly after being fully aware of oneself being a trash.\u201dThe sound of a male and a female hovered around the edge of Shen Yanxiao ears.Who are these two scoundrels for them to unexpectedly dare to curse her as a trash? When has the organization cough out these two bastards that were tired of living?Being unable to deal with the soreness of her body, Shen Yanxiao had opened the pair of her eyes to look towards the origin of the sound.The youngster and the young lady that were approximately fourteen to fifteen years old were standing in front of the bed while folding their arms around their chests. The appearance of the two of them were rather quite outstanding. Excluding the manner of dressing of their clothes, they unexpectedly look the same.After they had noticed that the person that had been laying on the bed had woken up, not only did they had the slightest amount of worry of being caught by the person implicated but also had sarcasm throughout their face. They then extended out their contempt and despise as if they were looking at some trash.\u201cHey? The trashy seventh young lady of our Vermillion Bird clan has finally awakened? It is truly the ancestor\u2019s blessing for you to unexpectedly not dying after this heavy injury.\u201dThe beautiful young lady looked with despise and also without any cover up of her loathing towards Shen Yanxiao who had taken a seat at the bed.The attractive and intelligent youngster then sneered as he sweep a glance at the Shen Yanxiao\u2019s deathly pale complexion. \u201cIdiot, later, you should know how to answer grandfather\u2019s questions. If you dare to talk drivel, I can guarantee you that from now on, most of your life will be spent lying on the bed.\u201dThe disdain, threat and ridicule, and the blatant hostility had nevertheless provoked the slightest amount of anger on the person that was sitting on the bed.Shen Yan Xiao at this moment was simply unable to attend to what these two scoundrels had spoken as one segment after another segment of strange yet familiar scene were flooding in her mind now. Those memories that completely did not belong to her came like a wave. If she did not forcefully resist the urge of nausea, she probably would have been laid down once again.The memories that should have belonged from another person from the age of a baby mimicking adult cries till a small girl at the age of thirteen. One screen after another of disarrayed scenes had not only formed up into the record of the growth of the little girl till thirteen years old but also revealed Shen Yanxiao to a completely unfamiliar world.This world was completely different from the modern era society, for this entire world was in the midst of a fusion of the civilization of the ancient times of both the east and the west where it was flooded with fantastic dou qi as well as mystical magic. Even only in a tale will there be an emergence of a gigantic dragon as there was also such an existence inside this bizarre world.Being a godly thief from the 24th century, Shen Yanxiao simply did not dare to believe for she ought to be dead already but unexpectedly had a rebirth of an unfathomable mystery into this little brat\u2019s body. Even more, Shen Yanxiao did not know whether to laugh or cry as this little bastard unexpectedly had the same name as hers.The whereabouts of her as of now was on this piece of land called Guangming(Radiance) continent. As of the area she was at was the nation of the Long Xuan Empire which was within the Guangming Empire. As for the host body that she had possessed, it was precisely one of the big five clans in the Long Xuan Empire-The seventh young lady of the Vermilion Bird clan. In theory, it ought to be an identity of a gathering of myriad of doting onto that one person but from the speech of the two scoundrels just now, the host body that she had possessed was a useless piece of garbage true to it\u2019s name.Liked it?

Not only was the body\u2019s strength weak and pitiful and even the brain wasn\u2019t working too well. Undoubtedly that the body was already 13 years old but the IQ was nevertheless barely stopping over the phase of a 4 year old child. She was being called as the disgrace of the Vermillion Bird clan, the trashy seventh young lady.As for the two people who are standing in front of her bed, they were also from the younger generations of the Vermillion Bird clan. It was just that they were different from her whom was a trash while they sisters were older and talented. The two people respectively improved in the areas of dou qi and magic and both of them are called as the two of them were hailed as the future rising stars of the Vermillion Bird clan.As for the two of them, apart from improving their dou qi and magic, it was precisely bullying her the trash was what they had taken the most pleasure in.The reason why Shen Yanxiao was lying on this bed and also riddled with with scars was thanks to the two siblings.Relying on the Shen Yanxiao\u2019s mental retardation, they had agitated her into infiltrating the dungeon filled with imprisoned magical beast. As of a result, Shen Yanxiao was wounded by the imprisoned magical beast in the dungeon. If it was not for the dungeon keepeer who had noticed an anomaly, it was very likely that she would have already lost her life in the mouth of a magical beast.At last, after assimilating cleanly the other person\u2019s memories, only now did Shen Yanxiao had the time to deal with these pair of brother and sister scoundrels.However, it was very clear that at this moment, the two of them were worried about the investigation that was done about this matter by the clan head of the of the Vermillion Bird clan who was also their grandfather. Just as they were threatening her in not exposing out the two of them, they simply did not notice that the original stupid gaze had long replaced into one stroke of sharp gaze.\u201cYou have better obediently listen to our words and do not provoke us in making us not happy or else you ought to know the aftermaths.\u201d Shen Jiayi curled her lips as she looked at this idiot who was nominally her younger sister. If it was not because of worrying that the matter of personally breaking through the dungeon would have affected her, she would be disinclined to waste her words on this idiot.Shen Yanxiao raised her eyebrows and with a faint movement in her thoughts, she immediately exercised restrained her sharp gaze. She then exposed out one foolish and blank look. After she blinked her eyes and took a glance at Shen Jiayi, she shyly nodded her head.\u201cElder sister, I have already told you that this idiot simply do not know anything. Even if she is to say it is us, grandfather will absolutely not believe the words of an idiot. So, just why are you here talking nonsense with this idiot.\u201d Shen Jiawei, the younger brother of the twins, impatiently snorted.Shen Jiayi who had yet to respond to the her younger brother\u2019s question, she sized up Shen Yanxiao who was riddled with injuries. After being certain that Shen Yanxiao was still remaining as the same when Shen Yanxiao was still hearing and obeying her words as of before, only did Shen Jiayi felt reassured. Shen Jiayi then lead her brother out of the room.As for Shen Yanxiao\u2019s injury, whatever wounds she had didn\u2019t have anything to do with them? Even if she was to die in the dungeon,with regards to them, it was simply just one less eyesore of a trash in the clan. If it was not due to the fear of any issues emerging when their grandfather was inquiring, they will certainly be disinclined to speak that much of words towards a trash.Until after the two brother and sister had left the room, all of a sudden, it was as if the shy Shen Yanxiao had changed into another person. With a \u2018whoosh\u2019 sound, she jumped down from the bed.\u201cSss\u201d The immense movement had caused pain on the wound around her waist. Shen Yanxiao clenched her teeth as she examined the condition of her injuries on her new body. She inwardly sneered. Since the Heavens had given her one chance of a rebirth, she would naturally and carefully survive on with this new identity. However, according to the current state of conditions, it seemed like there were indeed too many issues with this new identity for she naturally could not proceed with the livelihood of the previous \u2018Shen Yanxiao\u2019.Trash?

It was just that as early as \u2018Shen Yanxiao\u2019 had recently reached her one month age, her parents were assassinated when they were outside. Of the family comprising of 3 of them, the only one that had survived at that time was her who was still at her infancy state.Although everyone in the Vermillion Bird clan did not completely give respect with regards to her as the trash, her grandfather, Shen Feng, was also the incumbent head of the Vermillion Bird clan had nevertheless cared for his son\u2019s sentiment and face. He had someone to look after Shen Yanxiao\u2019s food and drinks and her everyday life but there were only limited to these. As far as a big clan was concerned, a trash in both literacy and martial arts may be actually said to have no whatsoever worth to make use of to the extent that the very existence of her was precisely a shame to the Vermillion Bird clanEven for the annual clan banquet, she did not have any qualifications to participate in.With regards to this time\u2019s accusation of trespassing the dungeon, it was very likely that \u2018Shen Yanxiao\u2019 ,even if she did not die, she would still get a scalping.If it was not for her father\u2019s origin, it was very likely that Shen Feng would simply be unwilling to recognise her as his granddaughter. It can be said that as of now, Shen Yanxiao simply did not have any backing.\u201cThis situation is nothing but assuring.\u201d Shen Yanxiao was beaming as she sat on the chair then analyzing the current environment that she is dwelling at.This was simply just terrible to the very end for a waste and yet did not have any patron.\u2018However, it has been yet to be counted as to be disastrous.\u201d An exceedingly magnetic voice all of a sudden emerged at the edge of Shen Yanxiao\u2019s ears.Shen Yanxiao at once rashly and hurriedly stood up and cautiously survey all around.Although it may be said that this body did not have any whatsoever strength, on her previous life, Shen Yanxiao is nevertheless still a godly thief where her name had shaken the entire Earth. Whichever person\u2019s odor would definitely be unable to escape from her perception. However, within this big of a room, she had nevertheless detect the slightest amount of anyone\u2019s odor.In that case, just where did this voice come from?\u201cSince that you dare to utter, why is it that you aren\u2019t daring to show yourself?\u201d Shen Yanxiao squinted her eyes as she looked around.\u201cShow myself?\u201d That voice had once again sounded while carrying a hint of cold intention.\u201cLittle girl, there is no need to for you to look for me for I am not elsewhere but rather I am within your body.\u201dWithin her body?Shen Yanxiao stopped staring blankly.\u201cI originally have thought that you would be muddle headed for the rest of your lifetime but I did not expect that you would unexpectedly suddenly change and become intelligent. The things of the world do toy with humans. It looks like the Heavens do indeed want to give us a chance.\u201d The voice that was cold like freezing point had once again emerged at the sides of Shen Yanxiao\u2019s ears. However, this time, she could distinctly perceive that this voice really didn\u2019t come from this world but rather\u2026.. from her brain!\u201cJust what kind of a human are you?\u201d Shen Yanxiao was able to accept the matter regarding her rebirth but for this sudden arrival of this voice, it had truly nevertheless made her too hard to be convinced with it.\u201cHuman? In this world, there is no such human who can address me as such for they are more willing to call me as, devil.\u201dDevil? Shen Yanxiao knitted her eyebrows.\u201cGirl, how about we discuss a business deal?\u201d\u2018What transaction?\u201d Although Shen Yanxiao was unable to figure out the counterpart\u2019s identity, she was already clear that this bastard who was calling oneself to be a devil truly should be residing within her body.\u201cYou will assist me in reappearing into the human world and I will help you in untying the seal which will allow you to obtain the power that is rightfully yours.\u201d\u201cSeal?\u201d The more Shen Yanxiao listened, the more muddle headed she became.\u201cRoll up the sleeve of your right arm. \u201cIn complying to the voice, Shen Yanxiao rolled up her sleeve. At the upper part of her right arm, there was a palm sized mark onto the skin where its skin colour is slightly darker compared to the others. Previously, she had examined the body that she had possessed but she had failed to take note of the subtle disparity.\u201cThis is the seal?\u201d Damn it!

If you are willing to assist me, I will help you in undoing the seals.\u201dShen Yanxiao looked at the thing that was very hard to perceive by other people which was on the top of her arm. As she pondered over the reliability of the Devil\u2019s words, the corner of her mouth curved into a devilish smile..\u201cBefore proceeding with the discussion of details, shouldn\u2019t you put out a hint of sincerity to let me know what my future alliance\u2019s circumstances are? Also, why is it that you are able to appear within my body.\u201dWithin the whole world, it was very likely that there were a few people who were similar to Shen Yanxiao whoy would be daring to bargain with the \u2018Devil\u2019 that is existing in her body after their rebirth!After a moment of quietness, the chilly sound had once again echoed.\u201cAs for the strength that you have now, you still do not have the qualifications to know my name and you can temporarily call me as Xiu! As forf why I am within your body, you will have to wait till after you have undone the 7 layers of seals. Only then, will I inform you, for as of now you are too insignificant and knowing too much will only incur huge calamity.\u201dShen Yanxiao smiled as it could be said that apart from the incomplete name, Xiu, she did not obtain any useful information.\u201cThat is not the manner on how to negotiate. How will I know that after I have assisted you in returning into the human world, you will or will not quickly get rid of me later.\u201d Power was one good thing especially for her current situation. However, before she had yet to clarify some matters, she would not allow any unexpected future dangers concealed.Being a first rate godly thief, any potential danger would also be calculated within. Only after settling all of the dangers, will that one strike certainly hit the target and the goal would be acquired taciturnly.After being silent for a moment, Xiu speaked, \u201cKilling you is equivalent to killing me myself.\u201d\u201cAs of now, I am attaching myself and existing within your body. In case that you are dead, my soul will also subsequently fly away and scatter.\u201dThis information is not bad! Shen Yanxiao was beaming as she continued to acquire information fraudulently.\u2018So, after you have obtain your freedom, will it mean that you can be relieved in eliminating me?\u201d\u201cI will never kill you.\u201d\u201cOh? Why?\u201d Shen Yanxiao opened her mouth as she smiled happily while inquiring. However, there was nevertheless a complete differencebetween the naive smiles of hers and the sharpness in her eyes.\u201cDuring the time when I choose to stay in your body, we have already agreed and signed a soul agreement where I will lose ninety percent of my soul if I was to kill you.\u201d Xiu\u2019s voice was like the untranquil waves.To suffer a damage of ninety percent! Shen Yanxiao seriously wanted to clap her hands. Although it was still unclear on why Xiu was able to attach and exist within her body, she could now be certain that Xiu absolutely would not make any move regardless of any situation because everything was like he had said. For killing her was equivalent to himself committing suicide!\u201cNow, I shall undo the first layer of your seal and you will once more receive the power to learn dou qi and magic. This shall be the first gift of mine to you as the alliance with you.\u201d Accompanying the ice-cold voice of Xiu echoing within Shen Yanxiao\u2019s brain, Shen Yanxiao suddenly felt a burst of sharp pain arrive at the her right arm.The sharp pain was similar to huge earth shattering waves coming and sweeping as they arrived. Even before she had the time to open her mouth to inquire even more, her entire self was already sinking into the darkness once again.\u2026\u2026.During the time when Shen Yanxiao had once again awoken, an old and benevolent person appeared before her eyes.\u201cThe seventh young lady had woken up.\u201d The elderly man smiled as he said.Shen Yanxiao slightly frowned.

On his face, nevertheless he still showed a kind and smiling expression.. He then said, \u201c Seventh young lady, your posture is still weak. For this period of time, you have to rest properly. Uncle has brought you your most favorite osmanthus fragrans cake.\u201dAs a henchman of the Vermillion Bird clan, Shen Qiu was a brilliant doctor with medical expertise and also received with quite high regards by Shen Feng. Shen Qiu was a doctor whom had made painstaking efforts in delving into the medical field and he had never before taken a wife and had a child. As for the Shen Yanxiao whom he had frequently attended to, Shen Qiu was already treating her as his granddaughter. Although, he really was not the kin of the Shen clan, he had the intention to take care of Shen Yanxiao. But without Shen Feng\u2019s order,he can\u2019t meddle much.Shen Yanxiao smiled happily as she took the osmanthus fragrans cake and it was as if all of the sore on her body could not be compared with the desserts before her eyes.Talking about it, it was lamentable that even though Shen Yanxiao was provided with basic necessities, all of the things that she eat or used were only similar to the most inferior servants of the Vermillion Bird clan. So much so that, under Shen Jiayi and Shen Jiawei who had deliberately made things difficult for her, she would frequently be poverty-stricken. There wasn\u2019t even a need to say something about the desserts which were \u2018luxury goods\u2019.Looking at the appearance of that little bastard who have yet grown to adulthood and was rejoicing incessantly as she held the osmanthus fragrans cake, Shen Qiu secretly sighed in his heart. He knew that based on the Shen Yanxiao\u2019s intelligence,shet was simply unable to make sense of too complicated words. Therefore, there was nothing to worry about in repeating his words. \u201cSeventh young lady, this time, master is indeed angry and uncle also cannot help you in anything. For this period of time, you can be relived in recuperating. Anyway, uncle will try to procrastinate for you and will not allow this weak posture of yours to prematurely suffer the punishment from master\u2026..\u201dWithout batting an eye, Shen Yanxiao proceeded on in nibbling the desserts but her ears were nevertheless listening without missing any words when Shen Qiu was talking to himself.The Vermillion Bird clan\u2019s dungeon where magical beasts were raised was a forbidden area with regards to their grandchildren\u2019s generation. Leaving her aside, even both Shen Jiayi and Shen Jiawei did not have the qualifications to enter in. Her previous trespass into the forbidden area had already enraged Shen Feng\u2019s prestige. Prior to that, the two small bastards mentioned to Shen Feng that he must be responsible in asking her about that matter.However, as for what circumstances that the previous \u2018Shen Yanxiao\u2019 had ran into in the dungeon, Shen Yanxiao was nevertheless completely ignorant about it. From the memory she had inherited, it was completely chaotic. Apart from the slice of darkness and also the endless fear, she did not obtain any more information at all.Shen Yanxiao was very clear that Shen Feng would certainly not care about her, \u2018The Vermillion Bird\u2019s Shame\u2019 on the dangers that she had came across in the dungeon but he cared more about whether his reprimand would be ignored by others.Lucily, Shen Qiu had planned in helping her to stall time. Just from Shen Qiu\u2019s selfless conduct, this kindly old man had already changed her opinion and made Shen Yanxiao labelled him as a \u201cgood person\u201d in her mind.Shen Qiu had once again sat at Shen Yanxiao\u2019s bedside for a moment and he kept on harping some rubbish as there wasn\u2019t too much point in speaking too much. After all, in Shen Qiu\u2019s eyes, the little bastard before his eyes was still a young pitiful girl with the intellect of a four year old. After being certain that there were not too much issue with Shen Yanxiao\u2019s posture, only did Shen Qiu departed from the room.Just as Shen Qiu departed from the room, Shen Yanxiao then got out from her bed.She impatiently examined the conditions of her body. In her brain, she clearly remembered that a quarter of an hour before she lost her consciousness, Xiu had already helped her in undoing the first layer of the seal and also told her that Shen Yanxiao had already obtained the qualifications to practice dou qi and magic.Liked it?

This red mark that was barely the size of a quarter of the pinky\u2019s fingernail, had nevertheless indicated that the first layer of her seal was undone.\u201cThis me can cultivate in dou qi or magic? Xiu did not say it clearly.\u201d Although she was completely ignorant with the regards to Xiu\u2019s origin, Shen Yanxiao had nevertheless keenly perceived how formidable that \u2018Devil\u2019 was. It was a pity that she was completely ignorant about everything in this world and there was even no need to mention about cultivating dou qi or magic.\u2018If you are fond of it, cultivating both sides are acceptable.\u201d The cold voice that belonged to Xiu had once again emerged inside Shen Yanxiao\u2019s brain.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2019 Shen Yanxiao frowned as she pondered on the meaning behind Xiu\u2019s sentence.Was it possible that\u2026\u2026.Xiu\u2019s previous words was not really indicating her that she could cultivate and choose one among the two of them but rather that she could learn both of them.This\u2026. How is this not blissful?Through the memories of the body she possessed, Shen Yanxiao vaguely knew that there was two subdivisions of circumstances for the people in this world. The one kind of the people who were the norm candidates in cultivating dou qi were those who had a sturdy physique, tenacious tendons and veins, and also the ability in successfully condensing dou qi at the location of their dantian. As for the other type of people who were the norm in studying magic was that the body\u2019s condition were normally ordinary but had formidable spiritual force and also capable in manipulation of the spiritual force driving all kinds of elements in the world.The Heavens is fair as when it had given you a sturdy physique, it would not give you a formidable spiritual force. Therefore, viewing it broadly from the entire Guangming Continent, since hundreds of years, there have never been anyone who could obtain a situation in learning both martial arts and magic. Not only that, no matter whether it was dou qi or magic, if one wanted to reach a certain level, one needed to diligently cultivate. In one desired in obtaining an improvement, then one had to invest a great amount of time and energy into it. Not to mention about how heaven defying the existence of these people who possessed both the internal energy as well as spiritual force. Just imagining in wanting to cultivate on both of them at the same time was already a lunatic\u2019s ravings.\u201cDid you mean that I can cultivate on both martial arts and magic? However, as of now, I am already 14 years old and I am still completely ignorant with the regards on both sides. With regards to the dual cultivation, it is an excessively remote thing for me.\u2019 Shen Yanxiao was very depressed because all of the people on the Guangming Continent would have picked a path that they would have walk down not long after they had became sensible. Now, as for she, she was already slower than every other people in setting out her path. With regards to any kind of cultivation, it was already too late for her. The dual cultivation in both magic and martial arts was only just a mock to her.\u201cIt is possible for you.\u201d Xiu\u2019s voice sounded both ice-cold as well as firm.\u201cThe physique of yours is completely different from others and with the help from me, every issue will no longer be an issue.\u201dShen Yanxiao was happy, how could she have forgotten about Xiu who was a \u2018devil\u2019 with profound mystery? One who was capable of relying on one\u2019s soul in depositing into another person\u2019s body and had survive in the bastard\u2019s body for ten or more years was absolutely not an ordinary person.Shen Yanxiao finally had hope after her previous issue was easily solved. She was very clear that the \u201cher\u201d now already did not have anyone to rely on. If she was unable to make herself to be strong quickly, it would be very likely that she had to eternally drape the identity of an idiotic trash over her shoulders to keep on living.Yet, this was exactly not what she wanted.\u201cYou will be teaching me dou qi and magic, right?\u201d Shen Yanxiao was in all smiles as she asked.\u201cSo long as you have the capability, I will then teach you everything that I have learn in my whole life and this will be the second gift of mine to you.\u201d Xiu\u2019s voice was full of unlimited possibility but the chilly voice of the words that Xiu had spoken could made anyone to be burning with angers.\u201cIn that way, I wish that we will have a happy collaboration.\u201c Shen Yanxiao\u2019s smile resembled a cheating cat. In having the aid from the mysterious Xiu, she would not be convinced that with her capability, she would have to bear the identity of an idiotic trash to keep on living!Liked it?

For these five days, apart from eating and sleeping, the remaining time was all used for Xiu\u2019s \u2018instruction\u2019 phase.Within the secure room, Shen Yanxiao wore an unlined whole body garment. Her body was already dripping wet and beads of sparkling and translucent sweats filled her small rosy face as she sat cross legged on the bed.\u201cWithin the period of 5 days, your dou qi has reached the standard of rank 4 while your magic has reached rank 3. With regards to only the human race, it can be considered to be barely good enough.\u201d Xiu\u2019s voice still sounded as ice-cold as it was before.One had to know that Shen Jiayi had begun cultivating in magic since young, and up till now, Shen Jiayi had only reached the standard of rank 5 while Shen Jiawei\u2019s cultivation on dou qi was merely at rank 4. Just like that, those had already got Shen Feng rather pleased.Shen Yanxiao had merely used five days time and had directly upgraded herself from the stage of a trash to her current standard. If this kind of astonishing speed was to be spreaded out, it would probably scare a group of people to death.Just five days, not only could she practice in cultivating both martial arts and magic, but also had nevertheless attained rank 3 and rank 4 respectively. This was somewhat a heaven-defying existence!For an ordinary person, there was no need to mention about five days. Even when there was five years, if they would want to attain any one of the Shen Yanxiao\u2019s standard, it would be very likely that they would be crowned with the title genius. What\u2019s more was the heaven defying cultivation method in cultivating both magic and martial arts.However, from Xiu\u2019s mouth, this astonishing speed was nevertheless only barely a good enough condition.Shen Yanxiao did not particularly understand the rankings of dou qi and magic in this world. Therefore, with the regards to \u2018barely enough\u2019 from Xiu\u2019s tone, it was inevitable that she would consider her cultivation speed to be so-so and did not have too much of an astonishment.\u2018Okay, let\u2019s call it a day, as tomorrow, I still have an episode of a \u2018strong war\u2019 that I need to fight.\u201d After exhaling a breath of air, Shen Yanxiao spread herself out on the bed as this was the result of her cultivating to the limit ,where her physical strength and spiritual force was seriously overdrafted. There was no need to talk about others as of now, even moving her fingers would feel strenuous.Tomorrow, she would be going to meet Shen Feng, the clan head of the Vermillion Bird clan and it was very likely Shen Feng would not easily let her off on the matter of trespassing the forbidden area.After all, she was simply one without anyone\u2019s reliance and depending on the mercy of the Vermillion Bird clan would it be barely enough for this idiotic trash to survive, but Shen Feng absolutely had no reason to be lenient in dealing with her.For the time being, Shen Yanxiao simply did not plan on revealing the matter about her complete change. After all, with the current situation and capability of hers, it was absolutely not a wise choice of hers to excessively expose out her bargaining chips. Even if Shen Feng was to notice her as a result of this but it was very likely not good for those people of her generation to know as they would not be satisfied at all in seeing an emergence of a competitor.Among the third generation of the Vermillion Bird clan, which one of them did not want to contest for Shen Feng\u2019s favour in order to increase their own bargaining chips of inheriting the Vermillion Bird clan. It was also exactly because Shen Yanxiao was previously an idiotic trash, therefore there was some people within the third generations who did not have the inclination to deal with her. Apart from Shen Jiayi and Shen Jiawei who harmed her for fun, Shen Yanxiao\u2019s situation was regarded as not dangerous at all.However, once she had revealed her own circumstances and also allowed them to know about her possession of a heaven-defying capability in cultivating both magic and martial arts, it would be very likely that those people could not hold back and mess around with her. What\u2019s more was that Shen Yanxiao had lost both her parents, and did not have a formidable patron within the Vermillion Bird clan. Once, she herself had became the target in the contest for the clan head position, it was very likely that the uncles that are supporting their sons and daughter in the contest over the position of clan head would also make a move in eradicating her, this young seedling that had just recently germinated.Although Shen Yanxiao did not have too much understanding regarding the rankings of magic and dou qi, she was nevertheless experienced in depth knowledge regarding the darkness of human nature.Liked it?

It could be said that there wasn\u2019t even one bit of respect towards the person who was still sleeping on her bed as they had forcibly lifted her up. She simply did not look like the seventh young lady but rather she was equivalent to the most lowest servant within the Vermillion Bird clan.\u201cYou truly have considered yourself as Miss High and Mighty for you are so old already and yet still need people to serve you in putting on your cloth and washing yourself.\u201dThe servant that had looked slightly conspicuous and mean had crudely pull down Shen Yanxiao\u2019s unlined garment. Then, the servant had put on a set of cloth that was still considered to be neat on her body without any tenderness and gentleness with the strength of her hand. Also, on the face of the servant was even more disdain for this trash seventh mistress.\u201cIf it was not because of the lord\u2019s demand to meet her today, who would have nothing better to do and would come to serve her. I truly do not know what was the lord thinking of, for him to raise this idiot in this mansion. It was truly a humiliation to our Vermillion Bird clan.\u201d The other one of the servant girl was pulling Shen Yanxiao\u2019s hair as she casually comb it.Rather than saying that they were serving Shen Yanxiao in changing her clothes and washing her up, it would be better to say that they were tormenting her.\u201cWho has said it is not as this is simply just wasting the foodstuffs. This time, she had even unexpectedly charged into such a huge misfortune. It is very likely that the lord will not easily let this idiot off.\u201d\u201cFor this kind of a humiliation, it is the best to settle them early. You are unaware at all that all of the people outside are secretly using this idiot as a joke and there are not few mocking within our mansion.\u201dThe two servant girls dissatisfied muttered incessantly without the slightest bit of intention in avoiding the topic.From the elders up to the younger generations of the Vermillion Bird clan, apart from the clan head, Shen Feng who was still estimated to have regarded the blood relations on Shen Yanxiao\u2019s body, the others simply had considered the existence of Shen Yanxiao as a burden. Not only that, they were wishing that it was only better for this humiliation of the Vermillion Bird clan to die earlier so that they could leave out the stain made by this trash which made their Vermillion Bird clan to cease having its sacred position..Those words that were hard to accept was continuously transmitted into Shen Yanxiao\u2019s ears. On the facial expression of the fourteen years old bastard, there wasn\u2019t a slightest bit of billows as she opened up that pair of eyes which were still regarded as glittering while looking at the two servant girls who was not distinguishing between their own positions and made it seem like she did not completely understood the humiliation they were talking about.After a burst of tormenting her, Shen Yanxiao had finally completely dressed up and the two servant girls then immediately grabbed onto her in advancing into the main house.Along the way, Shen Yanxiao allowed the two of them to pull her cloth without any slightest intention to resist but under that pair of seemingly confused eyes, it had nevertheless flashed a ray of slyness.In arriving at the front door of the main house, the two servant girls immediately threw this headache to the chamberlain on duty without even turning their head back.There was no one who had even noticed that at the split second when the two servant girls had turned round and departed, the two embroidered pouch that were the size of the palm has shifted from their waist to the cuff of a certain little bastard.Shen Yanxiao had quietly placed her first stroke of \u2018income\u2019 ever since she came to this world into her bosom. Keeping it silent, she followed after the chamberlain with a tauted face into the main room.Just as she stepped into the main room, the door room behind her back was gradually shutted in an instant. The two panicked sounds, \u201cMy purse!!\u201d screeched in accompanying the heavy door closing sound was sealed off at the outside of the main room.Liked it?

Directly facing the entrance, the 60 year old Shen Feng\u2019s eyes were like torches as he sat on his chair with a dignified air. The graying hair on his temples revealed an unaging face that also gave off a strange amount of invisible pressure.Sitting upright and straight at both sides of the main room were the second generations of the Vermillion Bird clan. For most of them, they had all past 40 years old and anyone of them when put forward was a rare and outstanding person. However, in facing Shen Feng, they did not dare to have any hint of hurriedness.Standing behind their back were people that were considered to be the emerging powers from the third generation of the Vermilion Bird clan where each one of them had the vigorous looks on their face and also possessed the air of arrogance of a junior. After all, those people who were capable in standing within the clan head\u2019s room were all well-known figures in the Vermillion Bird clan. As for those people with low and petty strength, Shen Feng had long kicked them out of the clan and their lives and deaths were up to their own. At this moment, Shen Jiayi and Shen Jiawei who were just standing behind the back of a middle aged man were raising their eyes in gazing at Shen Yanxiao who had entered into the room.Within such a big main room, everyone\u2019s gaze were all falling onto the young girl who was standing in front of Shen Feng. No matter how it was looked, these kind of mediocre and frail people did not resemble of a child of the Vermillion Bird clan. That frail body that could not even endured one clench and that ugly facial expression far surpassed the looks of the third generation of the Vermillion Bird clan and on the particularly ugly look, was an ignorance hanging onto that confused face.Not long after Shen Yanxiao was summoned, the people of the second generation of the Vermillion Bird clan were filled with despise and jealousy towards her parents for the appearance of their daughter had completely went against the aesthetics of the Vermillion Bird clan.Shen Yanxiao\u2019s father Shen Yu was the \u201cyoungest\u201d young master of the Vermillion Bird clan. The people had described him where his handsome appearance was like a jade and between every moment of his, there would be an emission of a graceful and elegant air that would have numerous women greatly admiring him. Moreover, the attainments of his magic was rather high. At that year, it was considered to be that there was a great number of competent talents in the Vermillion Bird clan, he was also the outstanding one and had received the utmost value from Shen Feng. Shen Yu\u2019s wife was the number 1 refined beauty of Long Xuan Empire at that year and that devastating beauty of hers already did not have enough words to describe that beauty of hers. During those times when she was at her peak and was unmarried, a bunch of aristocrats came like ducks rushing in wanting to be her counterparts. Even more was that, in order to win that one smile of the beautiful woman, the people would not spare in totally dispersing their family\u2019s wealth.Being the daughter of such a golden couple, even if she did not have a world-shaking beauty, she should absolutely not have been that \u2018Ugly Duckling\u2019 before their eyes where she would not be found if she was to be thrown to a human pile.With regards to Shen Yanxiao\u2019s life experience, the Vermillion Bird clan had privately discussed about this for quite a lot as it was to no avail and they could only secretly mutter a few words as Shen Feng had never issue out any sort of approach regarding this issue.After all, Shen Feng was the genuine person who was in power within the entire Vermillion Bird clan.At this very moment, the aloof and remote Shen Feng was focusing his sharp gaze onto the body of his granddaughter which was standing before his eyes without lacking the slightest bit of billows of imposingness on his face.That picky gaze of his was like a cutting edge. After looking up and down on this granddaughter of his that he has long not seen, Shen Feng\u2019s eyebrows slightly puckered up.In seeing that Shen Feng was frowning, the people of the Vermillion Bird clan were snickering in their heart.It was very clear that, although Shen Feng had acknowledged Shen Yanxiao\u2019s identity, he was rather not happy regarding this stain.The entire main room was quiet as everyone was quietly waiting for Shen Feng to start talking.As Shen Feng\u2019s gaze had moved away from Shen Yanxiao\u2019s body, he uttered, \u201cShen Yanxiao, a few days ago, you have trespassed the forbidden area and rushed yourself into a great calamity. Do you know of your own crime.\u201dFrom the gloomy and heavy voice of Shen Feng, it was clear that he was inquiring but rather making an assertion.Within the main room, Shen Yanxiao blinked that big eyes of hers as she looked at \u2018her own\u2019 grandfather without the slightest bit of moodiness.Liked it?

You shall come and speak as for what has just happened on that very day.\u201d Shen Feng solemn gaze sweep past Shen Ling. Within that wise and farsighted eyes, the tenderness between a father and a son was unseen but there was only the imposingness of a leader.Shen Ling inwardly forced a smile as among the four sons of Shen Feng, he was ranked the youngest after excluding Shen Yu within the second generation. However if he was to be compared to Shen Yu who was a fine scholar and soldier, he would only seem to be much more mediocre. Within ordinary days, he was not of any value to Shen Feng. However this time, the mishap was met in the dungeon and it precisely happened within the scope of his obligation.\u201cReporting back to clan head, on that very day, I was out in dealing with some matters and was not within the mansion, it was the subordinates of mine, the 3 imperial bodyguards who were in charge of guarding the dungeon. By the time I returned to the mansion, I have already received their notification that said there was someone who had intruded the dungeon.\u201d Shen Ling secretly wiped out the cold sweat. This was because although trespassing the dungeon was not a small error, what was frightening was that magical beast that was imprisoned in the dungeon. On that very day, the Vermillion Bird clan had indeed spent up to hundreds of elites life to only capture this treasured species!In fact apart from Shen Feng, Shen Ling was the only one in the Vermillion Bird clan who knew about what had happened on that very day. The reason why Shen Feng was making a big fuss over a minor issue by inquiring Shen Yanxiao in front of everyone was simply not because some trivial matter like trespassing the dungeon.The matter that had genuinely startled Shen Feng was not something anyone from the Vermillion Bird clan could have absolutely thought of.\u201cWas the one who was guarding the dungeon on that day present?\u201d Shen Feng opened his mouth as he asked.The moment when Shen Feng was asking, it had nevertheless made everyone who was within the main room stunned.This matter was precisely a finalized conclusion because on that day, Shen Yanxiao was discovered to have passed out in the dungeon. Speaking reasonably, Shen Feng only needed to send a punishment order to Shen Yanxiao and it was done. However, today, Shen Feng had unexpectedly adopted an approach in wanting to have the whole story of this matter investigated till the truth came to light. This matter was certainly fishy! Everyone indistinctly thought that the mistake that Shen Yanxiao had made was very likely not as simple as just only trespassing the dungeon.And at this very moment, both Shen Jiayi and Shen Jiawei\u2019s complexion became deathly pale for they didn\u2019t expect that Shen Feng would investigate and go to the bottom of this matter. It had to be know that on that very day when they were deceiving Shen Yanxiao in entering into the dungeon, they had already looked for a pretext in having the 3 guards who were guarding the dungeon moved away. Only then, did they have the opportunity to have that idiot entering the dungeon.At this moment, Shen Feng had unexpectedly wanted to question these 3 guards. If by any chance those 3 of them disclosed the two of them, it was very likely that with their grandfather\u2019s intelligence, he could guess that it was them who were the ones that were making troubles behind his back.At this moment, Shen Jiayi and Shen Jiawei really wanted to cry for they would have never dreamt or imagined that this one small matter of trespassing the dungeon would have unexpectedly angered the aloof and remote Shen Feng who placed such a value on it. They had originally planned that after threatening Shen Yanxiao in keeping her mouth shut, they could be free of worries. Who would have thought that Shen Feng still made such a move.As of now, every air of arrogance and complacentness had disappeared on their face and leaving only panick-stricken looks in their eyes.The middle aged man,Shen Yue who was sitting in front of Shen Jiayi and Shen Jiawei who was also the father of these two siblings had vaguely perceived the uneasiness in both the children of his. He slightly wrinkled his knitted eyebrows but had not said any much words.The 3 imperial bodyguards that were in charge of guarding the dungeon were very quickly brought forward into the main room. They respectfully kneeled in front of Shen Feng in awaiting for the clan head to inquire them.Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was unexpected that you guys actually released someone into the dungeon, just what has happened to the rules!\u201c In inquiring this kind of trivial matter, Shen Ling could not dare to trouble Shen Feng in opening his mouth and so, he started opening his mouth in questioning.These 3 guards also knew that this matter was not as simple as it seem and could only be secretly cautious.\u201cOn that very day, this subordinate really does not intend to release the seventh young lady into the dungeon. However, at the moment when the seventh young lady infiltrated the dungeon, all of the subordinates were not present at the dungeon\u2019s entrance.\u201d One of the guards solemnly and cautiously replied.\u201cNot present at the dungeon\u2019s entrance? Then, where did you guys went to? Could it be that you guys do not know that any staff that was guarding cannot leave without any permission during the time frame when they are guarding the dungeon\u2019s entrance?\u201d Shen Ling asked with the voice filled with anger.The dungeon with imprisoned magical beast was the Vermillion Bird clan\u2019s forbidden area. As for those imperial guards that was guarding, not only did they need to prevent the people from the Vermillion Bird clan to enter without any permission but also they would even more need to guard against the people from the other clans with aspirations in infiltrating the dungeons to carry out destruction. For the guard to leave without any permissions, it was simply just one\u2019s dereliction of duty!Those guards were self aware that it was difficult to escape from their own mistake and could only hurriedly say, \u201cIt is this subordinates\u2019 carelessness but on that very day, fifth young lady and sixth young master had said that they had a pressing matter that needed these subordinates\u2019 help. Only then, did these subordinates\u2026..\u201dAfter those words of theirs, it became exceptionally quiet within the main room and within a split second, everyone\u2019s gaze were diverted to Shen Jiawei and Shen Jiayi\u2019s bodies.The two juvenile was already having a guilty conscience but at this moment, the fluster which was across their face was even more like \u201cone being frightened easily\u201d.\u201cIs there such a matter?\u201d Shen Feng who seldomly opens his mouth asked with that sharp gaze of his, falling onto the body of the two panicked siblings.\u201cGrandpa\u2026..\u201d Shen Jiayi who was flustered wanted to open her mouth to refute but she had nevertheless knew what the right words to say at that moment..As for Shen Jiawei, he was even more without any opinion and was lowering his head like an ostrich.Just at this very moment, Shen Yue who had been keeping silent silent from the very beginning up till now had stood up and had respectfully said to Shen Feng, \u201cReporting to the clan head, this two children will reach their sixteen years old within the one months time. Therefore, during this period of time, the two of them have continuously and painstakingly seeked for information regarding the magic beast. On that very day, this two unfilial children of mine have originally planed to visit fifth brother to inquire on things about the magical beast but fifth brother was away from home by chance. And so, in trying to find anyone that can help in this crisis, they can only disturb the imperial bodyguards that are guarding the dungeons. However, they did not expect that as a result from that, it allowed other people to have chance in taking advantage of this opportunity which is trespassing the dungeon and they had made a serious mistake. So, clan head, please do punish severely!\u201dThose upright and plainspoken words of Shen Yue were to beg forgiveness for the two children of his and this had made Shen Feng\u2019s complexion slightly alleviated.Shen Jiayi and Shen Jiawei\u2019s faces were without any blood red colour as things were contrary to what they had expected. They had originally still hoped that their own father would have exculpated for them but never had they expected that the moment when he opened his mouth, the first thing he did was that he had taken initiative to beg forgiveness for them!For there was such a father that did not recognise his own family and was placing righteousness before his family!Within the main room, each and every one of them was sighing endlessly for Shen Yue\u2019s action of placing righteousness before his family and they somewhat believed the excuse that was thrown out by Shen Yue.Within the Guangming continent, every single youngster that would be reaching sixteen years old would undergo one special coming of age ceremony and on that very day of their coming of age ceremony, they would have possessed the very first magical beast throughout their whole life! Therefore, regarding Shen Jiayi and Shen Jiawei\u2019s matter in trying to find someone that could help them in this crisis could also be said to let it pass by. After all, regarding this matter, anyone of them would have also treated this as an exceedingly important matter.Within this world, dou qi and magic could be classified as one own\u2019s cultivation capacity while magical beast would normally represent as their own fighting companion that would accompany them for the rest of their life. If one was helpless in the cultivation of dou qi or magic, then they may have came across with any juncture from one\u2019s search on the magical beast. If one was capable in possessing one magical beast that exceed one\u2019s strength, it was very possible for one to make a comeback from the danger spot with the usage of one\u2019s magical beast\u2019s formidable strength in confronting a rival that had a higher level of cultivation.Liked it?

It appeared that as of now, this thing had implicated these two brats, Shen Jiayi and Shen Jiawei. While it was within the bounds of what was to be expected, Shen Yue\u2019s attitude provided much food for thoughtBased on the appearance, it may have seemed like Shen Yue was inhuman in treating these two brats by begging for forgiveness but in reality, this move of Shen Yue had nevertheless purged away the one possibility of these two brats that had instructed \u2018her\u2019 to trespass the forbidden area. In addition to that, this passionate move would make them know the reason and would treat Shen Jiayi and Shen Jiawei as two people who had the mentality of vigorously improving one\u2019s self by striving in raising one own\u2019sstrength.On the other hand, this would have the entire matter\u2019s target shifted to \u2018her\u2019, that person who had made use of this opportunity to trespass the dungeon.That one simple segment of words could be expressed out by Shen Yue again and again with so many layers of meanings. This Shen Yue was seriously one who couldn\u2019t easily be dealt with!Shen Feng did not immediately gave his response on Shen Yue\u2019s request but he was quietly looking at the two siblings that were standing behind Shen Yue\u2019s back.\u201cThird uncle\u2019s upright and plainspoken words have yielded people to admire.\u201d Suddenly, a distinct bright sound had echoed within the main room.The face of the juvenile was like elegance of a white jade. As he slowly revealed himself by walking away from his father\u2019s back, he looked at Shen Yue who was filled with seriousness on his face with a smile. This juvenile was slightly older compared to the two siblings and the appearance of his surpassed Shen Jiawei by even more than one means. Carried on that peerless handsomeness was a relaxing smile that would make people unconsciously want to get close to him.Shen Yue frowned in seeing that person but he was secretly sneering in his heart.Shen Yifeng, one of the strongest among the third generation! With the age of barely 17, he had already stepped over the 6th rank of dou qi. Beginning cultivating the first 5 ranks of dou qi and magic was regarded as not difficult at all for the first 5 ranks of both sides were only indeed the beginning of cultivation.When after one\u2019s magic and dou qi had went up till the 6th rank, they had to carry out a selection in their cultivation path.At the initial of rank 6, the cultivation in dou qi and magic would branch out to 3 different path of development.Before rank 6, those who cultivated in dou qi and magic were called differently as magic apprentice and fighter. After rank 6, those who cultivated in magic could select in becoming among these 3 types which were a magician that was with the extremely strong attacking nature, a technique scholar that possessed mysterious incantation technique and a priest that sustained the divine power. As for those who had cultivated dou qi, they could choice in becoming a strong sword scholar, a cavalryman that possessed extremely strong flexibility or an archer that could take a man\u2019s severed head within the thousand miles distant.As for Shen Yifeng, as early as he was fifteen years old, he had already successfully made a breakthrough from the fighter phase and had selected to become a strong sword scholar. Now, with merely 2 years time, he had already became a 3 star Sword Scholar. In viewing this broadly since the Vermillion Bird clan\u2019s lifetime, there was also only the deceased Shen Yu who had this astonishing amount of innate talent.However, it was a pity that Shen Yu had died an untimely death. As for the Vermillion Bird clan now, Shen Yifeng was nevertheless like a sun in a high noon and just like that, he had became the number 1 person within the younger generation of the Vermillion Bird clan.Liked it?

What\u2019s more was that Shen Yifeng\u2019s father was the Shen Feng\u2019s second son which Shen Feng had most value of currently. Also, Shen Yifeng\u2019s father would be the one who would most likely be the next generation\u2019s clan head.At present, even Shen Yue would also not dare to rashly take part in a mutual fall out with Shen Yifeng.\u201cGrandfather, although seventh younger sister was already 14 years old, the wisdom of her was nevertheless still of a sincere 4 years old child. Yet, with that wisdom of hers, how could she be capable in capturing the fortunate timing when guards were departing and then charged into the dungeon?\u201d Shen Yifeng clearly spoke, \u201cAlthough this grandson was not in touch with seventh younger sister that much, I nevertheless knew that seventh younger sister would rarely leave the courtyard. There was even no need to say about her wanting to walk till the entrance of the dungeon which was located at another section within the mansion. If one wanted to say that seventh younger sister had truly unintentionally walked till to the entrance of the dungeon at that time and in that way, it is rather too much of a coincidence for a completely lucky in running into the time when the guards were not there.\u201dInverting the Heavens!Shen Yanxiao was naively standing at her original place but in her heart, she wanted to slam the table and shout with praise for the sudden emergence of that stroke of genius, Shen Yifeng! With only regards to her memory, Shen Yifeng was privately in touch with Shen Yanxiao when he was young. However, in front of people, the way he had dealt with her was still counted as courtesy and did not resemble every other members of the Vermillion Bird clan that had treated her with harsh criticization. However, the two of them could not be said to have any friendship and the sudden emergence of him to exculpate for Shen Yanxiao at the present had truly made everyone to be greatly taken aback.Rather than saying that Shen Yifeng was helping, would it not be better to have said that he was thinking of getting these two brats, Shen Jiayi and Shen Jiawei into trouble.Shen Yanxiao was laughing leisurely for in any case, she was an \u2018idiot\u2019. For whatever they had said, she was \u2018unable to make any sense out of it\u2019. If she was happily smiling, what can they do about her?Therefore, with that healthy mentality of hers, Shen Yanxiao just sat down while waiting to watch the play and witnessing that huge play that was on the eve of starting.Just as expected, these words of Shen Yifeng had made Shen Yue\u2019s face looked very unsightly. Shen Jiayi and Shen Jiawei had guessed and pondered out that their own father previously desired to defend them secretly but they hated with the regards the sudden emergence of Shen Yifeng\u2019s itchy teeth. Originally, they were already not in good terms with Shen Yifeng and now, Shen Yifeng once again jumped out to say these which had made them secretly hate him more.Shen Yifeng\u2019s words was like a fuse which had ignited a suspicion within everyone\u2019s heart.Shen Feng was silently looking Shen Yifeng who was wearing onto that smiling expression and then lowered his head in looking at Shen Yue whom was beneath him.\u201cAs for this matter, just who is the one that has done it was not important. Today, why I have convened you all here is because there is an even more important matter that needs to be addressed of.\u201d Shen feng slowly started talking.Shen Yue inwardly loosened his breath. As for the life or death of this idiot, Shen Yanxiao, he would not be bothered but when the matters concerned Shen Jiayi and Shen Jiawei, how could he allow this matter to proceed on.Shen Yifeng was faintly staring blankly but he also did not say anything much. After all, even though, he had received a considerable amount importance from Shen Feng, he was the younger generation of Shen Yue according to the clan hierarchy and should not excessively strive to oppose Shen Yue.Just like that, it was over? Shen Yanxiao secretly raised her eyebrows. She had originally thought that Shen Yue and Shen Jifeng would begin to fight with each other but did not expect that there was no development to this. Shen Feng\u2019s approach had everyone grasp onto it unclearly. It was originally said that today was to interrogate her, but now just what had it to do with her? As of now, it was also said that this matter was no longer important. Just what song is he singing to?In her heart, Shen Yanxiao was with heavy suspicions but she had never forgotten the identity of hers as of now and she was solely engrossed in playing the fool as she watched that good show because as for others, there was no whatsoever relation with her.After pausing for some time, Shen Feng said, \u201cDid all of you all think that I am enraged because of the fact that someone had trespassed the forbidden area? But do you all know that what kind of a species was that magical beast that confined in that dungeon?\u201dLiked it?

Except for Shen Ling who had an understanding to the outlines of the matter, the others simply did not know just what was the appearance of that magical beast that was imprisoned in the dungeon. It had to be known that ever since this magical beast was brought back into the mansion, Shen Feng had issued a strict order that no one was allowed to enter inside without any permission.Everyone was actually curious but there was some weight in Shen Feng\u2019s words within the Vermillion Bird clan and who would have the guts to violate his words?Even if Shen Jiayi and Shen Jiawei were full of curiosity towards this magical beast, they too could only dare to make a smale-scale commotion by sending Shen Yanxiao to peek behind his back but they themselves did not absolutely dare to even take one step in.However, what they did not expect was that on that very day when Shen Yanxiao was carried out by the imperial bodyguards, she was already riddled with scars and blood had covered all over her body as if she was soaked by blood. If it was not because of that faint undulations at the pit of her stomach, it was very likely that everyone would have thought that she was already dead.As for what had happened inside the dungeon and how was that magical beast, apart from Shen Feng and Shen Ling, the others simply did not have the access in knowing.Today, in seeing that Shen Feng was mentioning the magical beast, everyone also did not dare to talk any words.Shen Feng snorted as he said, \u201cNever would I have thought that ever since the hundreds of years of my Vermillion Bird clan, it was unexpected that no one is capable of rousing the Vermillion Bird again and that class of incompetence made people to simply sneer at us..\u201dShen Feng\u2019s words had shocked everyone endlessly. The reason why the Vermillion Bird clan was able to ascend to such an eminent and unapproachable position in the Long Xuan Empire was all due to the time of the initial founding of Long Xuan Empire, the ancestor of the Vermillion Bird clan had obtained a Vermillion Bird of the ancient times. With the cooperation of the Vermillion Bird, the first clan head of the Vermillion Bird clan had helped the monarch in establishing an enormous advantage during the war in founding the country. Among a great number of magical beasts, the Vermillion Bird\u2019s deposition could yield in making numerous beast to prostrate themselves in worship. With just a high cry, it was sufficient to shake up all of the bird type magical beast.They could only conjecture something out of the rumors that the formidability of the Vermillion Bird could only had differed greatly from the strength of an ordinary magical beast. With the usage of the Vermillion Bird\u2019s strength, the Vermillion Bird clan was established. However, after two hundred years of its golden age, it had resulted in a tranquil for nearly a hundred years because from the elders to the youngsters of the Vermillion Bird clan, it was unexpected that no one was capable of rousing the Vermillion Bird that was lying dormant one more time. There was even no need to mention about making a contract with the Vermillion Bird.This matter itself could be said to be a big grief for the Vermillion Bird clan for the past few years.Anyone would have known that having this Vermillion Bird is equivalent to having the Vermillion Bird clan. It could even carry the Vermillion Bird clan back to its summit once again!This matter was what every younger generation of the Vermillion Bird clan had yearned for even in their dreams. However, for the past many years, there was even no need to say about signing a contract with the Vermillion Bird for there was even no one who had the capabilities to wake the Vermillion Bird that was lying dormant at the lava valley.\u2018Clan head, it is not only the Vermillion Bird clan. Even for the Azure Dragon clan, White Tiger clan, Black Tortoise clan and Qilin clan, there are also no one who are able to wake their mythological animal already for the past hundred years\u2026\u2026\u201d Shen Jing, the third son of Shen Feng muttered in a low voice.What Shen Jing had said was actually true. At the founding of the Long Xuan Empire, in receiving the 5 ancient animal deities blessings, they were complacent with their merits in founding the empire. However, for these hundred years that had came, it was as if the 5 animal deities had made an appointment in sinking into a deep sleep together and there was no one that had woken up. The deep sleep caused by these 5 animal deities had burned anxiousness in the 5 big clans.Shen Feng frowned as he swept past to have a glance on Shen Jing. Among all the 6 sons of his, Shen Jing could be said to have made the least progress among the sixth of them. Besides spending his time in drinking and pleasure during the entire day, he would fool around with the children of the noblemen. If it was not for the care of the blood relations in his body, Shen Feng would seriously want to grab onto this unfilial son of his and threw Shen Jing out of the clan where his life and death would be on his own.Liked it?

Not long before, I have received an information that a new sage was already birthed at the God\u2019s domain. A hundred years ago, the sage from the God\u2019s domain was precisely in charge of the matter in waking the mythological animal. As of now, the new sage has already descended. As far as I know, the Azure Dragon clan is already setting out preparations in inviting the sage to undertake this already deemed impossible task of waking the mythological beast.\u201d Shen Feng coldly said.\u201cWhat!\u201d There was an uproar from everyone for wouldn\u2019t that mean that among one of them would have the opportunity to receive the Vermillion\u2019s Bird\u2019s vows in loyalty and devotion!!The Vermillion Bird clan that had been quiet for quite a long time already had upsurged the heaven startling billows.Shen Yifeng was inwardly pleasantly surprised because at that time, when he had reached 16 years old, he originally ought to have sought for a strong magical beast to sign a contract but his father nevertheless had not made any movement up to this day where he was already a 3 star Sword Scholar but still did not have a magical beast. Throughout one\u2019s life, everyone could only sign one contract with one magical beast. In other words, in viewing this broadly, within the Vermillion Bird clan, it would only be he himself, Shen Jiayi or Shen Jiawei that had the opportunity to obtain the Vermillion Bird?Although Shen Jiayi and Shen Jiawei\u2019s innate talent were not bad, when they were compared to the man himself who was labeled as a genius, the disparity between them was nevertheless far. They simply could not be considered as his opponent!This was simply sending the Vermillion Bird directly to his bosom and how could he not feel happy about it?Shen Yue\u2019s complexion as of now was even more unsightly because he would have naturally thought of the question that Shen Yifeng was thinking of. However, the two children of his were truly negligible when compared to Shen Yifeng and so it was truly somewhat difficult if they were to contest for the Vermillion Bird.\u201cIf it is so, should we make an action to some extent? Please do not allow the other four clans to try to be the first and that will be good enough.\u201d Since Shen Duan was self aware that the victory was in the grasp of his own son, he would naturally somewhat unable to sit still.Shen Feng sneered as he said, \u201cFor this kind of matter, is there still a need to say about it? I have long ago sent someone who was in contact with the sage in the God\u2019s domain. Although the sage has agreed to come to the Long Xuan Empire to help us, he has one condition before helping us which is that the gift has to be a rank 8 Snow Spiritual Fox. Only then will he leave. As for the magical beast that was imprisoned within the dungeon, it was precisely the Snow Spiritual Fox that I ordered people to catch.\u201d\u201cClan head is thorough with everything!\u201dOn Shen Feng\u2019s face, there was even the little bit of smiling expression.\u201cDo you all know just how disastrous the damage is to our Vermillion Bird clan when capturing the Snow Spiritual Fox? However, just what has all of you idiots have done!\u201dShen Feng\u2019s sudden arrival of furiousness had incessantly made everyone puzzled over for they could possibly guess just how much of a damage it was to catch the Snow Spiritual Fox. The Snow Spirtual Fox was a rank 8 higher ranking magical beast. Although, its degree of savageness was not that pressing compared to other magical beast, no magical beast would truly be able to be its match in terms of its shrewdness. In wanting to catch it was exactly not a simple matter at all.Shen Feng\u2019s gaze was falling onto Shen Yanxiao\u2019s body. Looking at this emphatically not intimate granddaughter of his, he was unable to make out to either be happy or to be angry.\u201cOn that day of the trespass into the dungeon, the Snow Spiritual Fox has meet a tragic death. Without the Snow Spiritual Fox, just how are we, the Vermillion Bird clan invite him to make a journey to here!\u201dThe Snow Spiritual Fox is dead!!Within the main room was echoes of sounds of drawing air out.Shen Yue\u2019s complexion became deathly pale while Shen Jiayi and Shen Jiawei nearly slipped and fell to the ground.Just how would have they anticipated that the momentary curiosity of theirs had destroyed the Vermillion Bird clan\u2019s chance to return to the peak.Everyone became dejected because the Snow Spiritual Fox was very valuable and for the Vermillion Bird clan to be able to obtain one, they had already payed out too much heart\u2019s-blood. If they were to catch another one, it was very likely that this would wound the foundation.At this very moment, everyone\u2019s gaze was concentrated onto Shen Yanxiao\u2019s body for no one would have thought that after this idiot had entered into the dungeon, there would be such a huge and unexpected matter to occur.A rank 8 magical beast just died like that with an unfathomable mystery in the dungeon. Yet, within this dungeon, apart from the Snow Spiritual Fox that had died tragically, there was only this good for nothing seventh young lady!Liked it?

What is this Snow Spiritual Fox? She herself was completely unaware of what they were.Within her brain, regarding everything that had happened inside the dungeon was just a piece of darkness. She simply did not know what had just happened inside the dungeon. However, Shen Yanxiao nevertheless perceived that the moment when the news was declared out that the Snow Spiritual Fox was dead, those gazes that were falling onto her body were exactly like sharp knives completely running through herself.If it was not because of Shen Feng\u2019s obstruction, it was very likely those people would have long already pounced onto her and made a mincemeat out of her!She was innocent\u2026..Just at the time when Shen Yanxiao was depressed that she herself had became the target of multitudes of arrows, Xiu\u2019s voice emerged within her mind.\u2018Just an one small little rank 8 magical beast had unexpectedly managed to made the silly humanity to such bitterness. Seriously, what a trash.\u2019Shen Yanxiao remained silent. Although, she had not met this mysterious rank 8 magical beast, she understood that in this world with the power, richness and valiantness of the Vermillion Bird clan, Shen Feng was the only one as of now that possessed a rank 8 magical beast. As for the others, being able to handle a rank 6 or 7 magical beast was already considered to be the best quality and for an ordinary person, they would at once thanked the heavens and earth if they had a rank 3 or 4 magical beast.The Vermillion Bird clan\u2019s unique high level rank 8 magical beast had nevertheless became \u2018a small little rank 8 magical beast\u2019 after passing through Xiu\u2019s mouth\u2026..If Shen Feng was to know that he was to be evaluated like that about the sacrifice of hundred of the Vermillion Bird clan\u2019s elites for that Snow Spiritual Fox, will he or will he not pass out due to being angered.Suddenly, Shen Yanxiao had one unpleasant thought.Is it possible that, this senior arrogant idler had done something to the Snow Spiritual Fox\u2026..\u201cWith a slip of a hand, it was crushed to death.\u201d Xiu seemed to be able to guess the question that Shen Yanxiao had wanted to ask and so Xiu indifferently said.Crushed\u2026 to\u2026 death\u2026\u2026..Shen Yanxiao at this moment was at a loss in conveying her state of mind for it was as if someone had told her that when that person was walking, that person had accidentally used one\u2019s toe to crush a heavy tank into a flour paste\u2026\u2026She really wanted to say to that arrogant idler, Xiu\u2026\u2026 Please crush me to death!It was a pity that Xiu\u2019s voice could only be heard by herself. Otherwise, she would possibly just hold onto respectable ultra-deity and smashed onto everyone\u2019s face then laughing at them while they prostrate themselves in worship.As of now\u2026Shen Yanxiao could only silently bear those ruthless stare from their eyes.The heart ached like one that would probably not be in love again.Shen Feng inhaled a breath. The reason why he had all of the main clan members to anxiously come over was precisely that he wanted to inform them about this matter. As for the punishment\u2026Looking at that face that completely did not resemble of his little son, Shen feng could only secretly sighed.If only Shen Yu was still present\u2026.\u201cShen Yanxiao! You have committed a great blunder by nearly destroying the Vermillion Bird clan\u2019s foundation. It is simply repulsive!\u201d Shen Yue angrily glared at Shen Yanxiao for he knew that this matter had implicated up to the Vermillion Bird and it was no longer a small matter. As of now, he only wanted the two children of his to get out this cleanly.After knowing that he missed a great opportunity due to this idiot, for Shen Yifeng who previously had the intention to cover for Shen Yanxiao \u2014 helping her? Fat chance, even if he doesn\u2019t say anything and give a final push, the thing that happened was already \u201cthat bad\u201d\u201cThis is simply making trouble. The clan head has taken pity that this child is orphaned but unexpectedly do not believe that this child has bitten the hand that feeds her and would charge into such a calamity. This kind of a trash that brings disaster everywhere could no longer be retained here anymore! Still, clan head, please do punish!\u201d At Shen Duan\u2019s pits of stomach was a suffocation of a mouthful of blood. In seeing that his own son could have very quickly obtained the Vermillion Bird and ascended to clan head position but was unexpectedly destroyed by this idiotic trash. He truly wished that he could choke her to death while she was still alive. As of now, he was feeling even more hate and had Shen Feng quickly punish this trash.Liked it?

As for the others from the second generation, there was an unwillingness to speak any more words about it. Shen Feng\u2019s brows tightly puckered up as if he was thinking over something.Just like this and she would be sentenced to death penalty? Shen Yanxiao did not anticipate that this matter would have unexpectedly developed into such from the direction of the joyful feelings of hers. However, thinking about it, at this moment, it was related to the Vermillion Bird clan\u2019s reputation. If they were to miss this chance, they wouldn\u2019t be sure as to when or how long they\u2019ll have to wait for the Vermillion Bird Clan\u2019s capability to be recovered. What\u2019s more was that she was an orphaned, foolish crippled idiot. Using her to suppress everyone\u2019s fury was a choice that could not be better.On top of that, in eliminating a child of the third generation that is precisely a trash would also be somewhat beneficial for the children of the third generation and what could they have against it?Without having any patron and anyone to depend on to, Shen Yanxiao who had just recently arrived onto this new world was suffering from the malice which was all around and was thrown at her.Concealed within her sleeve was the little hands of hers that was clenching tightly while Shen Yanxiao was secretly grinding her teeth.They had better hope that she wouldn\u2019t make a comeback from this or else what these people had given her, she would absolutely pay back to them by ten times or hundred times. Vermillion Bird? Clan head of the Vermillion Bird? So long as she was able to live through this today, she would be determined to have the entire Vermillion Bird clan thoroughly change their clan head!\u201cSecond uncle and fourth uncle, there is such a huge grievance from you two! What grandfather unknowingly needed was indeed this bastard!\u201d Accompanying that gentle and sweet sounding voice that came through from outside of the door was the tightly secured entrance of the main room being slowly opened. That juvenile with that slender body appearance was wearing onto a white cloth and that gentleness like jade seemed as if the god had descended down to the world. That smiling expression was as if the juvenile was given a joyful news. The juvenile then dignifiedly stepped into the main room.Behind the juvenile\u2019s back was 4 robust men lifting up a huge iron cage as they sluggishly entered into the main room.Within that iron cage was a white snow fox with half the height of a human quietly leaning onto the metal cage. It had a pair of dark green pupil of the eyes were slightly bent upwards and that lustre of that snow white fur which generally captivated person.\u201cShen Siyu\u2026\u2026\u201dThat juvenile that had came trippingly had drawn uproar from everyone within the main room.The juvenile wasn\u2019t really the kin of the Vermillion Bird clan but rather an orphan that Shen Feng had brought back to the Vermillion Bird clan ten years ago to be fostered. There wasn\u2019t anyone that had knew about his ancestry and they had only knew that Shen Feng had named him as Shen Siyu. His seniority in this clan was similar to the children of the third generation.Shen Siyu was just 18 years old and that handsome complexion of his would have overshadowed Shen Yifeng\u2019s elegance. If it was to be said that Shen Yifeng\u2019s handsomeness was like the stars in the night sky then Shen Siyu would precisely be that moon in the night sky.How could the brightness of a star could be a contestant to the moon\u2019s splendor?The appearance of Shen Siyu had went beyond everyone\u2019s expectation for he would often emphatically not be at the Vermillion Bird clan for most of the time he would be dispatched by Shen Feng to elsewhere and his whereabouts were erratic. With regards to every movement of Shen Siyu, all of the movements were following the personal arrangement of Shen Feng. There was no need to say about Shen Siyu\u2019s whereabouts, even the depth of his strength itself within the Vermillion Bird clan was an enigma.If it was really not due to the fact that Shen Siyu was not the descendant of the Vermillion Bird clan, it was very likely that Shen Duan and Shen Yue, the children of the second generation would long ago joined hands in eliminating this godson that Shen Feng had valued the most.It had to be said that these past years, Shen Siyu had matured and became more handsome with that air of elegance. The loftiness that was emitted from every one of his movement had made Shen Duan not daring to be acting rashly.\u201cBefore this grandson had returned to the city, I have heard about the matters from the God\u2019s domain and have learnt that the sage needed a Snow Spiritual Fox as a gift. On my journey in returning back, this grandson has fortunately meet this little thing and easily brought back to give to grandfather. I still hope that grandfather will please kindly accept this.\u201dWithin Shen Siyu\u2019s canthus was a smile that was contained and that handsome complexion of his was like the most perfect work of an art from the Heavens.Liked it?

That pampered bully of the former days had no longer existed and there was only the existence of a young lady that was in infatuation.\u201cGreat! Great!\u201d After blanking for a moment, Shen Feng immediately laughed out.Not taking everyone\u2019s gaze into consideration, Shen Siyu walked with quick step up to Shen Yanxiao\u2019s side. During the moment when Shen Yanxiao who had still been unable to react and respond, Shen Siyu spreaded both his arms and embraced her in his bosom.\u201cYanxiao, I have returned. You can be relieved for as long as there is still me, there will be no one who can bully you.\u201d Shen Siyu\u2019s voice was very light and very tender.However, those words which had transmitted to likes of Shen Duan\u2019s ears was nevertheless like those ear-piercing thunder rolls.Shen Yanxiao blinked her eyes. In sniffing in that fleeing cool and fresh breath, she was silently thinking of\u2026\u2026Wouldn\u2019t this be considered as her being indecently assaulted!Within her brain, the memories of Shen Siyu had subsequently sprang up. If it was to be said that Shen Yanxiao was the disgrace of the Vermillion Bird clan, then Shen Siyu would precisely be the pride of the Vermillion Bird clan. It was only a pity that he wasn\u2019t the blood relation of the Vermillion Bird clan and would be incapable of in succeeding the position of the clan head.However, this \u2018pride\u2019 had nevertheless treated this \u2018shame\u2019 especially well which was different from Shen Yifeng who had pretended righteousness where Shen Siyu was sincerely treating her well. Based on the initial memories of her, on every appearance of Shen Siyu, it would always be in protecting Shen Yanxiao from being framed by others. From Shen Siyu\u2019s obstruction, only then, will other people like Shen Yue not make fierce moves on Shen Yanxiao. However, the well treatment from Shen Siyu to Shen Yanxiao had also cause Shen Jiayi to be sick of Shen Yanxiao.That sense of crisis of a young lady had truly nevertheless filled her full with the fires of jealousy.Perhaps it was due to the previous memories of the possessed body that had came about a trace of familiar feeling within Shen Yanxiao towards Shen Siyu. Towards this older brother, she was not particularly conflicted.However, at this very moment, Xiu\u2019s blurted out a sentence.\u201cNot bad.\u201dWhat was not bad? Shen Yanxiao was not very clear about it.At the same time when he was pacifying this little bastard within his bosom, he warned those people that had conspired and had went against the law. Shen Siyu kneaded Shen Yanxiao\u2019s little head, you can see it in his eyes that Shen Yanxiao is the apple of his eyes.\u201cSiyu, you have done quite well this time. What rewards do you want?\u201d Shen Feng\u2019s state of mind was pretty well with that Spiritual Snow Fox.Looking back and froth at Shen Yanxiao who was in his bosom and that Spiritual Snow Fox, Shen Siyu faintly smiled as he said, \u201cIf it is so, then grandfather, please do pardon Yanxiao\u2019s wrongdoing. Apart from this, this grandson has no other request.\u201dWhat\u2019s with this attitude of \u2018fiercely protecting one\u2019s children\u2019?! Shen Yue and Shen Duan stupefyingly looked at this strongest rival of their own sons. They did not dare to believe that after this guy had returned with a great merits, the rewards would have unexpectedly used onto the body of this trash!Shen Feng smiled as he said, \u201cIf that can make you happy, so be it.\u201dNo one dared to question what Shen Feng had said.Speaking about it again, it was simply too worthwhile with the regards to the exchange between this one opportunity in rousing the Vermillion Bird with a life of an idiot. If Shen Siyu was to then say that he had wanted to become one of the agreed candidate of the Vermillion Bird clan, then it would be very likely that they would have to cry themselves to death within their own room.Although Shen Yifeng had the grasp in instant killing Shen Jiayi and Shen Jiawei, Shen Yifeng would always feel that he would have been the one that would be insta-killed if he was to face Shen Siyu.That one episode of dispute had thus came to an end. The death of the Spiritual Snow Fox along with the arrival of the new Spiritual Snow Fox was to be hidden and not be spoken openly. After Shen Feng had said some words, he then dismissed everyone. This time around, he had personally arranged his trusted aide in looking after the dungeon to prevent the occurrence of the misfortune once again.As for Shen Yanxiao, she had felt that the event from the beginning up to the end had nothing to do with her.Without a doubt, if it was not for Shen Siyu who had abruptly brought the \u2018Death Penalty Exemption Golden Medallion\u2019 which was like a god had descended, she would have possibly pleaded with the arrogant idler Xiu to make a move to save that tiny life of hers.Liked it?

Before the presence of Shen Duan and Shen Yue or the enormous presence of the Vermillion Bird clan, she was powerless in struggling and resisting against them.She could only clenched tightly onto that trump card of hers which was to speed up the undoing of her seal which in turn would allow her to become more stronger and then returned all of the frights that she had received and pounded onto her today.After a round of her treating the matter as if they were unrelated to her, Shen Yanxiao did not suffer from any loss and all of this were actually due to an older brother that had an extremely serious attitude in fiercely protecting \u2018his children\u2019.On her previous life, Shen Yanxiao was an orphan. Since she was young, she had scattered and ran within the entire city. All of her foods and clothing that she had were all dependent on the skills of hers where she seized her chance in stealing other people\u2019s stuff. [Literal meaning-Leading away a goat in passing] At the time when she was 15 years old, she was only picked up by the people from the organization to be nurtured. Within the organisation, it was certain that there was no one who had cared for her life or death. During that early moment when she was brought back, she was brought back with an ample amount of orphans amounting up to more than a hundred of them. However, after the course of the 3 years of time frame, ultimately, there was only 3 person left that had survived the training.Never had her experience an affection that had gotten through to her but for the first time ever, she came across such a person who had incessantly protected her which was why it was one kind of a shocking scene to her.There was no need to mention about those two brats, Shen Jiayi and Shen Jiawei for even in front of the presence of Shen Yue and Shen Duan, Shen Siyu\u2019s loftiness was like one where he could hold the pass against ten thousand enemies by himself. And so, those two brats who had originally taken pleasure in bullying Shen Yanxiao could only somewhat cast their eyes onto Shen Siyu. After that, they immediately at once obediently rolled till the corner and constantly dawdle at there.Shen Jiayi had originally wanted to take advantage on the time that Shen Siyu had returned by showing him that adoring intention of hers by nurturing some youngsters all of a sudden. However, Shen Siyu had lead Shen Yanxiao with one hand of his and had just walked past her without even glancing at her sideways. Even that voice of hers greeting Shen Siyu, \u2018How are you Brother Shen Siyu\u2019 had already been put aside to be broken into dust by the wind force.In the eyes of Shen Siyu, apart from the clan head, Shen Feng, only Shen Yanxiao was the sole person capable of receiving his recognition.As for those dregs, he doesn\u2019t even want to grant them the luxury of a glance.Accompanying Shen Siyu\u2019s return were large quantities of culinary foods and gadgets that were sent to Shen Yanxiao\u2019s tiny room which was not spacious at all. Shen Siyu was so busy to the point where he had no time to accompany Shen Yanxiao as Shen Feng had sent people right away to summon him.Sitting cross legged on top of her bed, Shen Yanxiao\u2019s mouth couldn\u2019t help but twitch as she looked at the desserts and gadgets that had piled up like a mountain on top of the table.As for those desserts, she could still somehow understand but those little things are clearly what a preschool child would have liked. Just what kind of a joke was this!It was quite evident that all along, Shen Siyu had treated Shen Yanxiao and pampered her as if she was like a baby. However, as of now, Shen Yanxiao\u2019s soul was indeed an adult. In confronting with this childish item, she did not know whether to laugh or cry and all she could was to silently ask the firmament.If not gold and silver, even gifting her jewels and accessories would be good, at least one can sell them for money!Just at that moment when Shen Yanxiao was inwardly wiping away her tears, in a rage, Shen Jiayi, who had been ignored by Shen Siyu had killed her way into the room.The moment when she entered into the room, she immediately saw that pile of presents on top of the table and that pair of eyes of hers which filled with anger had momentarily became red in jealousy.\u201cYou, idiot, on what basis had made Brother Siyu treat you that well! You are simple just a trash! Idiot! Even the most inferior servant within the mansion is one hundred times stronger than you! You simply do not deserve to have Brother Siyu\u2019s items!\u201d Gripping her fist tightly, Shen Jiayi tenaciously glared at Shen Yanxiao who was sitting on top of the bed where within the eyes of hers was the unwillingness that had practically burnt away all of her rationality.In looking at face of Shen Yanxiao which was not special to look at, Shen Jiayi\u2019s hatred at reached to the extreme.She was obviously much more prettier and smarter compared to this idiot. Then, just why was it that the gaze of Shen Siyu had always nevertheless placed onto the body of a trash. She was unwilling and not resigned to the fact that she herself had unexpectedly would lose this kind of trash that had nothing at all!Liked it?

She then lifted her hands and spread open her palms. A very small flame which was ignited at the hollow of her palm had gradually coagulated and inflated.As for those people who had cultivated their magic before the rank 6, the amount of skills that they could master was simply not that much and the skill that Shen Jiayi was using as of now was precisely the fireball technique which was one of those few countable skills.\u201cYou don\u2019t deserve them!\u201dWith jealousy, Shen Jiayi shot out that fireball that was at the hollow of her palm. In accompanying with that rumbling loud sound was a scarlet flame that was frantically engulfing that pile of fine gifts that were on the table. Within a blink of an eye, those sweet smelling desserts which had its smell scattered everywhere together with those fine gadgets were all combusted inside the raging flames and had instantly turned into ashes.From the start till to the end, without any sort of reaction, Shen Yanxiao was sitting on top of the bed as she silently looked at Shen Jiayi who had became radical due to her jealousy.In burning those things that did not belonged to her, the jealousy in Shen Jiayi\u2019s heart had nevertheless declined the slightest bit. She knew that Shen Siyu was summoned by Shen Feng and within the whole Vermillion Bird clan, there was simply no one that would show up at Shen Yanxiao\u2019s room at this moment. Therefore, no matter what she was to do to this idiot at this very moment, there would simply be no one to prevent it from happening at all!The jealousy and the unwillingness had urged Shen Jiayi to approach Shen Yanxiao step by step. In relying on her being slightly taller to Shen Yanxiao, Shen Jiayi grabbed Shen Yanxiao\u2019s neck firmly and roughly dragged her out of the bed in advancing towards that combusting flame.\u201cI actually really want to see whether Brother Siyu would have still pitied you, this ugly idiot after burning away your hairs and eyebrows!\u201d Shen Jiayi fiercely said. With the outside of the room being guarded by Shen Jiawei, she simply did not have to worry about others finding out about the conduct of hers. Even if there was someone that had taken notice to what have happened during this whole event, it would have also be treated as Shen Yanxiao being careless and had overturned the candle flame which had resulted in creating a fire that had burnt away all of the presents as well as her own hairs!There would be no one that would have suspected her for there was simply no one who would have cared about the life or death of this idiot!Except for Shen Siyu.Brats of nowadays were getting more and more savage. Shen Yanxiao still naively follow Shen Jiayi as Shen Jiayi dragged her nearer to the flame. However, inside the eyes of Shen Yanxiao, a vile smiling expression had nevertheless flashed past.As it became more and more distinct that the heatwave could be felt brushing across the skin, Shen Yanxiao squinted her eyes and looked at the frenzied Shen Jiayi as well as the heap of raging and combusting flame in front of her. The corner of her rosy mouth curved up inadvertently into a sinister smile. A portion of formless qi flowed and condensed at Shen Yanxiao\u2019s fingertips which had gradually formed into a tiny flame. That flame was concealed behind the back of hers whereas Shen Jiayi who was in front of her was simply did not discovered about it.In seeing that she arrived in front of the combusted table, within Shen Yanxiao\u2019s eyes, \u2018a sinister flower bloomed out\u2019. The very small flame was sent out flying like an arrow leaving the bow!Just when Shen Jiayi wanted to drag Shen Yanxiao into the flame, Shen Jiayi felt a burst of piercing pain at her ankle. Without the slightest amount of guarding from her, the body of hers had momentarily lost balance and in a panic, the body of hers had directly fell facing onto that bonfire!!!As the blazing flame had wrapped her up, that high temperature had invaded Shen Jiayi\u2019s whole body. The burn wound that had spread onto her skin had her unable to contain herself from miserably shrieking. She simply did not know what happened to her and just how she mysteriously tripped and fell into the bonfire.In the midst of those sharp pains, Shen Jiayi who was within that bonfire struggled as she rolled and the eyes of hers were unconsciously looking at the tiny silhouette which was standing outside of the flame.Shen Yanxiao was still with that sort of slight built and still had that unprepossessing face.Liked it?

Shen Yanxiao was very clear that this kind of a flame would simply be not enough burn Shen Jiayi who had cultivated magical powers to death and it would only made her suffer some superficial wounds. Therefore, Shen Yanxiao did not have to worry about whether Shen Jiayi would have died or not. Shen Yanxiao merely had to stand at her original place and quietly enjoy that face of Shen Jiayi twisting in pain.The moment when Shen Jiawei who was guarding at the outside of the door had heard that miserable shrieks, he had somehow felt that it was fishy. After all along with that familiar voice that had produced out more and more miserable and mournful shrieks, he had only came to realise that there was some problem. With that bumping sound, he knocked open the door of the room.In that split second when the door was opened, the scene that was drawn into the eyesight of hers as Shen Jiayi was struggling inside the flame. As for what that had made Shen Jiawei astonished was actually that one person who was standing beside that flame which was Shen Yanxiao where she was wearing a smile.\u201cJiawei! Save me!\u201d Shen Jiayi could only beg for help from her younger brother as she simply had no way in getting out of the jammed destroyed burnt wooden table where the flame was mercilessly burning and roasting her body.Only then did Shen Jiawei\u2019s soul returned back to his body in a flurry. He did not have the time to ponder on that unfamiliar and very sinister smile that was on Shen Yanxiao\u2019s face as he hurriedly ran out of the room to call for help.After a short period of time, Shen Yue had then brought a group people and hurried to Shen Yanxiao\u2019s room. After a few buckets of clear water, the intensity of the fire had finally subsided.As for Shen Jiayi who had been tormented by the flame for ages, she had already passed out long ago due to the fright as well as the lack of endurance of her physical strength.Around a quarter of an hour before evening, those people that had came to be inquired as well as Shen Feng and Shen Siyu had looked at the room which was in a mess. After they had looked at the room, their complexion were unsightly.Shen Feng who was standing in front of the door was frowning as he looked at Shen Yue\u2019s face which was filled with anger as he held Shen Jiayi. Before, Shen Feng had yet had the time to open his mouth, Shen Siyu who was at his side had already first walked till Shen Yanxiao\u2019s side. He then pulled her to one side and inspected on every part of her body to see whether she was injured or not.\u201cShen Yanxiao. You have fairly done well!\u201d Shen Yue distressingly looked at the daughter of his which was still at the bosom. If it was not for the fact that Shen Feng was here at this moment, it was very likely that he would have already long ago pounced Shen Yanxiao and ripped her apart into fragments.As Shen Siyu had Shen Yanxiao protected behind his back, he looked at Shen Yue and said, \u201cSecond uncle, why do say such a thing? Just what had this matter got to do with Yanxiao?\u201d\u201cHow could it be that she is unrelated to this matter? Jiayi was injured in her room and it is very clear that it is this vile spawn that has harbour this evil intention tin wanting to injure Jiayi!\u201d No matter how Shen Feng was to think about it, Shen Yue had always from the beginning just would not be convinced that Shen Yanxiao being this kind of trash would have been one of the blood relations of the Vermillion Bird clan.Raising this kind of trash was precisely a disgrace to the Vermillion Bird clan and yet, nowadays she was rushing into disaster in quick succession. As of now, she had injured his daughter and how could he possibly tolerate her.The usually gentle Shen Siyu squinted his eyes and a smear of dangerousness flashed past his eyes.\u201cAll of you, just shut up!\u201d Shen Feng shouted loudly in a low voice. In a glance, he glared at Shen Yue who was rambling.\u201cI will say it one more time. She is Shen Yu\u2019s child. If there is anyone who had dared to carelessly reproach again, then that person had better rolled out!\u201dShen Yue could only clenched his teeth and pushed down that anger in his heart as he said, \u201cDad, Jiayi is indeed your biological granddaughter and as of now, she was actually unexpectedly being injured by this trash. Could it be that you are not going to care about this matter!\u201dFamily relationship. If Shen Jiayi was Shen Feng\u2019s granddaughter, then how was Shen Yanxiao not one?

Second uncle, are you trying to say that Shen Jiayi who is rank 5 in magic is injured by Yanxiao who is completely lacking in magic and dou qi?\u201d A trace of mild anger had floated up on the face of Shen Siyu which was previously gentle like jade. That trace of angry intention had nevertheless added another share of aloof and remote air to the cultured and refined gentleman in the former days.Even if it was precisely Shen Yue, he too had finally perceived that share of powerful oppressing feel emitting out of Shen Siyu\u2019s own body and was inwardly fearful.Just what level of strength had this youngster reached for him to unexpectedly be able to send out this kind of a formidable imposing air!A person who was of rank 5 in magic and was injured by an idiot who completely did not know dou qi and magic? If that was to be spreaded out, that would definitely be able to become the biggest joke in the Long Xuan Empire in this hundred year time.There was no need to say as for whether Shen Feng would believe in it or not, even Shen Yue himself would have very likely not be able to accept this kind of fact. If it was truly so, then wouldn\u2019t it might as well be said that a trash was much more formidable than the daughter of his which he was intensely proud of up till now?Shen Yue\u2019s complexion had changed from white to green and to purple.\u201cJiawei, you tell me, in the end, just what has happened.\u201d Shen Feng wrinkled his eyebrows. The matter had occurred in Shen Yanxiao\u2019s room and according to reasoning as usual, with the appearance of Shen Jiayi and Shen Jiawei here, Shen Yanxiao certainly would have been the unlucky one. However, today, it appeared as if they had swapped their position. Shen Jiayi was still unconscious while Shen Jiawei\u2019s face was one with that emaciated look.Shen Jiawei was nevertheless completely afraid of the habitually silent Shen Feng. Even though Shen Feng was his grandfather, Shen Feng was nevertheless completely unintimate with Shen Jiawei ordinarily. In having his name called out, Shen Jiawei swallowed his saliva and he subconsciously looked at Shen Yanxiao who was being protected at Shen Siyu\u2019s back. Shen Yanxiao as of now had as if she had once again returned to her previous state, the confused and ignorant idiot. That demonic and unrestrained look from just now had completely disappeared but with that merely short amount of time, that scene had nevertheless deeply engraved into Shen Jiawei\u2019s mind. Unknowingly without a reason, the moment he looked at Shen Yanxiao, his inner mind was no longer heading to the direction of contempt and despise towards her but there was only that earth-shattering unwillingness.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you speak!\u201d In seeing that the son of his was gazing onto that idiot like a fool, Shen Yue had gotten angry.With one quiver, Shen Jiawei hurriedly speaked, \u201cI\u2026 I also do not know anything at all, sister only asked me to guard the door. As for what has taken place within that room, I am completely unclear about it.\u201dUsually, Shen Jiawei would have bounded to \u2018throw stones at the person who fell down a well\u2019. Therefore, even if, he had not seen Shen Yanxiao making a move, he would have absolutely shifted the blame onto her. However, as of now, his mind was like a rock that was pressed down and no matter what, he would have also not dared to speak any hint of words to slander Shen Yanxiao.He definitely wouldn\u2019t want to see that kind of a smile that would have made people\u2019s blood running cold for a second time.\u201cGuarding at the doorway?\u201d Shen Siyu shot a glance at Shen Jiawei and Shen Jiawei was like a startled quail shrinking its neck. Shen Jiawei then shrinked back at one side.Shen feng wrinkled his brows more deeply. As of now, there had not been any sort of clues. Shen Yanxiao\u2019s wisdom was only at a standard of a 4 year old and those things that was inquired from her mouth could not be counted on. As for Shen Jiayi, she was still in the midst being unconscious and it was more unable to be counted on.\u201cHave these people withdrawn first and then I will have Shen Qiu to look at it. You people think we don\u2019t have enough things piling up, do you? What are you loafing around for? Go do something or other!\u201d Shen Feng was having quite a headache for as of now, all of his mental and physical strength was placed onto the matter of rousing the Vermillion Bird and where would he still have the mood to manage those trifling matters that those brats are pointlessly arguing about.Under Shen Feng\u2019s command, everyone couldn\u2019t help but to handle them in a glance.Shen Yue exceedingly and unresigningly left together with Shen Jiayi and Shen Jiawei.

In seeing that thepile of present have already been burnt into ashes, he said, \u201cYanxiao, you do not have to be worried for I will send someone again to deliver some of those presents tomorrow.\u201cJust who would be worried about those things?\u201d Shen Yanxiao silently rolled her eyes in her heart. Except for those edible things which was somewhat regrettable for her. As for those fine but completely useless toy belonging to \u2018preschool children\u2019, there wasn\u2019t a slightest distress for her.Shen Jiayi\u2019s unluckiness had caused those two brats into not going and harass Shen Yanxiao anymore for these past few days. Due to the reason with Shen Feng, Shen Siyu had very less time to accompany Shen Yanxiao by her side. Therefore, Shen Yanxiao who was idling had once again been dragged by Xiu to carry on that devilish type of training.As for the initial cultivation of the dou qi and magic, it was the most fastest. However, as one approached rank 6, the speed became slower in trying to reach the next rank. Even with the 4 days of devilish training, it had barely made Shen Yanxiao\u2019s dou qi and magic to have advanced to rank 4 and rank 5 respectively. From the perspective of an ordinary person, this speed was freakish but to Shen Yanxiao, it could only be said to be a tortoise speed when it was compared to the previous day where she had advanced one rank.\u201cDamn it. Just why is there even not a slightest bit of progress at all.\u201d Around nighttime, Shen Yanxiao concluded that one day of cultivation of hers. It could be said that today\u2019s advancement was like the \u2018jamming of a cartridge\u2019. The dou qi could still be considered to have a slight increment but there was still a certain amount of distance to reach rank 5. As for her magic, there actually wasn\u2019t even the slightest bit of movement.These had made the Shen Yanxiao who was used to that rocket speed of advancement to be unable to get used to it.\u2018My undoing of the first layer of your seal will only enable you to have the physique to cultivate both magic and dou qi. So long as the second layer of seal is not undone, your advancement in the later ranks will only become slower and slower. In reaching until a certain rank, you will no longer be able to make any more advancement.\u2019 Xiu\u2019s voice echoed in a timely manner.\u201cJust what is this seal?\u201d Shen Yanxiao was a little bit depressed for didn\u2019t she had properly said that she would have made \u2018a counterattack for that danger spot\u2019 and would climb up the ranks to become the clan head of the Vermillion Bird clan. If it was truly like what Xiu had said, then it would have been very likely that after she had advanced into the a certain rank, she would be unable to make anymore advancement. The feeling in undoing the seal was fun but the follow up question would definitely not be small.\u2018Didn\u2019t I say that it would have inhibitions on your strength. Undoing the first layer of seal is only but the beginning. If you want to become stronger, then you have to continue to undo the later seals. In this way, not only you can continue advancing but also, those strength that was previously inhibited would subsequently gush out.\u2019 Xiu\u2019s voice was still the same as before where it was tranquil without any ripple and a hint of chilliness was carried together.\u201cThen, what is needed to undo the second layer of seal?\u201d Shen Yanxiao asked.Xiu went silent for a moment and then only said one statement, \u2018Demonic Beast\u2019Demonic beasts were vicious organisms that were scattered everywhere across the Guangming Continent and resided in dark places. They were not humans, magical beast and even not those ordinary animals. They were a type of a very vicious existence which fed on domesticated animals and humans. The more larger it was, the more formidable its strength was. As for those ordinary demonic beast, they were merely savage but for those higher level demonic beast, they could nevertheless transform into the shape of a human. They could then conceal themselves inside the area where the humans live and used this opportunity to look for their own targets.With regards to the demonic beasts, the human\u2019s visceras were their most favourite food which was similar to those enticement from the gourmet food. In Guangming Continent, countless number of humans had died in the mouth of the demonic beasts. There was a period of time where the number of demonic beasts had reached to a critical number and were able to endanger the survivability of the human race. This had caused several countries in the Guangming Continent which couldn\u2019t help it but to join hands to attack. They integrated their armies in carrying out the disposing of those demonic beasts.Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Those areas were left unchecked and were not a proper place for the humans to reside. As for the area that Shen Yanxiao and the others were living at, although it had once been cleansed, most of the demonic beasts that were eliminated were of the inferior demonic beasts. As for those higher level demonic beasts that were able to transform, they continued hiding within the city where the humans were living as before. Merely, they had became more crafty. After each and every attacking incident, they would vanish without a trace as they depart from that crime scene making it quite hard to hunt them down.Within the Long Xuan Empire, a demonic beast was a very frightening existence. Therefore, in anyone of these cities, so long as there was a transmission that there was someone who had suffered from an attack of the demonic beast, it would immediately trigger an enormous movement.During this period of time, Shen Yanxiao had somewhat more or less understood many things about this world. With regards to the demonic beast, she too had slightly heard about it. However, she was not that clear on just how was there a link between the undoing of her seal and the demonic beast which was a savage kind organism?\u2018I need absorb the power within the crystallic nucleus of the demonic beast to recover my strength. So long as my strength is somewhat recovered, I will naturally be able to help you in undoing one layer of seal.\u2019\u201c\u2026\u201d Shen Yanxiao was slightly taken aback and looked vacantly.With the death of a magical beast, it would leave behind a nucleus with its power stored in it. As for the nucleus that stored the demonic beast\u2019s power, it was called as the \u201ccrystallic nucleus\u201d. The magical nucleus was absolutely well received because it could be combined onto the weapons of the cultivators of magic and dou qi which would bring forth a formidable strength. The stronger the magical beast was, the power within the nucleus that was left behind after its death would also be even more formidable.However, the crystallic nucleus and the magical nucleus were different.The power within the magical nucleus was extremely pure where the people could directly use it. However, within the crystallic nucleus, it was completely mixed with a dense dark presence. Although the power within the crystallic nucleus was also formidable, yet, there were very few people who were able to withstand that kind of a dark presence that was emitted from the crystallic nucleus.If there was someone who had used weapons that was combined with the crystallic nucleus for a long time, then that person\u2019s body would quickly be subjected to erosion brought by the crystallic nucleus.In the words of Shen Yanxio, they would be plagued by qi deviation if the erosion was light and they would die a martyr\u2019s death if the erosion was heavier.Only those few experts that had extremely strong spiritual force would have dared to use the crystallic nucleus. In addition to that, they would only dare to use a crystallic nucleus that was of a lower rank than them.No matter how it was to be said, this crystallic nucleus was only regarded as a \u2018chicken ribs\u2019 to the people which had hardly any worth eating it.She completely had not thought that \u201cthat kind of a chicken rib\u201d would unexpectedly be the thing that was a crucial point in recovering Xiu\u2019s strength. She could only say that when it came to taste, some people liked it heavier\u2026\u201cAcquiring a crystallic nucleus drop was not that hard for previously after the few countries made a joint attack in eliminating an extremely huge number of demonic beast, a large number of crystallic nuclei were stored up within the hands of each countries and there were not that many people who wanted this kind of stuff. As of now, with a casual walk to the auction, one could buy a large quantities of it right away.\u201d Shen Yanxiao utilised the knowledge that she spent a lot of time in learning this time around. In short, this matter was still considered to be manageable and she didn\u2019t care whether Xiu\u2019s liked it heavier or not.As of now, the only problem was that\u2026She was awfully poor!For she was an idiot! For she was a trash! For she was a specialized rice weevil!The Vermillion Bird clan would only be in charge of her food and clothing and how would they give her those kind of thing that was called as \u2018pocket money\u2019?Apart from the two purse that she had previously taken from the two servant girls, Shen Yanxiao could practically be said to have no other possessions and what was inside of the pocket of hers was even more cleaner than the face of hers. Although the crystallic nucleus was cheaper than the magical nucleus, there were still not that worthless like those bok choy leaves. With the meager amount of money that she had at the present, it would have been counted as good enough if she was able to buy one or two low level crystallic nucleus.[Note: Lion Opens Its Mouth is an idiom about someone asking for a high price]Liked it?

There was no need to speak about 30000 pieces for she could not even afford 30 pieces of them as of now!\u2018If it is the higher level ones, it will be best to have roughly about 2000 pieces and that will be good enough.\u2019 Xiu who was seldom \u2018considerate to others\u2019 had spoken again.So long as there was 2000 pieces, it would be good enough\u2026 would be good enough\u2026 would be!Shen Yanxiao suddenly became stern. During that time when the few countries had acted together, the amount of high level demonic beast that were eliminated were slightly more than 10000. After those nuclei were distributed across few countries, as of now, it was reckoned that the total sum of high level crystallic nuclei within the Long Xuan Empire would only be about 3000 to 4000 pieces. As for this certain great master, he wanted 2000 pieces the moment he spoke\u2026Unless she was that person who was sitting on top of that golden-bright and dazzling throne and had that precious-stoned crown worn on her head, or else, even if she was extremely wealthy, she absolutely would be unable to take out that tremendous amount of money.\u201cLet\u2019s talk about the inferior crystalic nuclei then\u2026\u201dAs for those high level crystallic nuclei, there was no need to think about it and Shen Yanxiao could only start with those inferior crystallic nuclei. After that one military campaign, with the amount of drops gained from killing the low level demonic beast, even if there were not amounted to millions, there would still be hundreds of thousands of them. 30000 crystallic nuclei were actually not an amount that would startle anyone. So long as there was enough money, all of the issues would no longer be one anymore.The Vermillion Bird clan was very well-off. After all, the Vermillion Bird clan had a stable seat as one of the 5 influential clan in the Long Xuan Empire. Even if it was to be said that they did not have a wealth that was equivalent to the entire nation, they were still very rich.If Shen Feng was to be in a good mood, buying those 30000 inferior crystallic nuclei was just like buying a tanghulu to him. However, the problem was that\u2026 Shen Yanxiao had to ask herself whether she had that kind of capability to do it or not and she did not have the bargaining chip that was capable in yielding Shen Feng to \u2018stake a thousand pieces of gold on one throw\u2019 for her.As of now, Shen Yanxiao\u2019s problem was precisely money!The only sole thing that made Shen Yanxiao rejoiced was that she had picked a proper \u2018occupation\u2019 for herself at that time, the godly thief, don\u2019t you think so?! With regards to her, this kind of thing called money was like a rock on the floor, that could be seen just about everywhere. If she had not widened her horizons at that time by being a hitman, a spy and so on, it would have been very likely that she could only silently stay at that dim corner and constantly dawdle about there!\u201cIsn\u2019t it just 30000 pieces! You can be at ease for by the means of this young master\u2019s skill, I will definitely make you eat till you feel like throwing up!\u201d With regards to her workmanship, Shen Yanxiao was quite confident in herself. What was more was that she was at the affluent Vermillion Bird clan as of now. Even with a casual pick from either the second generation or third generation, there would not be quite a disparity and it was just a great convenience to take advantage of.As a result to hearing those words, \u2018eat till you throw up\u2019, a certain great master had also accepted tacitly that certain sound of being complacent calling herself, \u2018young master\u2019.Therefore, during that certain dark stormy night, a petite black figure had begun to frequently appear at every courtyards of the Vermillion Bird clan. Numerous of times had those pair of sin-like claws stretching out to those pure and dependable purse.During the second day of the early morning, the moment when the first strand of sunshine had spilt onto the earth, waves after waves of mournful wailing burst out within that quiet Vermillion Bird clan.\u201cMotherfucker! Where is this daddy\u2019s money!\u201d\u201cFuck! Just where did such a thief that was tired of living had suddenly emerged, for the thief unexpectedly dare to steal money from this great aunt!\u201d\u201cThis daddy\u2019s bridal token, ah!

There was no need to say about money, even those few golden tools that they had collected in their rooms had all also subsequently disappeared without a trace.Among them all, the most miserable one was Shen Jing. In order for him to be able and have a better \u201cthorough experience\u201d with numerous beauties, Shen Jing would never have forgotten to buy a few precious stones and pearls everyday as he returned. A few days ago, he only had recently competed in buying large quantities of top notch precious stones from the commerce. However, today, during early in the morning, just when he was preparing to take out those precious stones and present them to those beautiful women, what was left for him was only just an absolutely empty jewelry box\u2026The thing that made his hair standing in anger was that this little thief had no conscience at all! This thief unexpectedly did not even let those few tiny precious stones which was on top of the jewelry box, even those few tiny precious stones were all dug out!!!Shen Jing already did not dare to count the amount of lost that he had suffered this time around. He only knew that in the future few months to come, he would have to wave his hands and bid farewell to those beauties\u2026Ever since the establishment of the Vermillion Bird clan, they had never suffered such a loss before like today!Although to the Vermilion Bird clan, the money lost could only be considered to be a hair from nine oxen, that thief\u2019s attitude had angered them!During that one night when the entire important members of the Vermillion Bird clan were robbed, surprisingly, there wasn\u2019t anyone who had discovered it happening from the beginning till the end. Just like that, it had allowed that person to quietly steal away that huge amount of money and this simply was a contempt to the prestige of the Vermillion Bird clan!Due to the economic problem and also because this involved their dignity, how could Shen Feng not care about this matter?\u201cYou guys are a group of good for nothings, for you guys unexpectedly did not even notice that someone had entered into and was stealing in your room!\u201d Shen Feng\u2019s anger was not light. Even though, over the last hundreds years, the Vermillion Bird clan was already incapable of rousing the Vermillion Bird, the offsprings\u2019 strength have yet tor disgrace the clan.This surely was \u2018great\u2019 for right after they have fallen asleep, their rooms were entered and had their stuffs stolen completely. Were this group of people all idiots? For they unexpectedly didn\u2019t even had the slightest bit of perception.\u201cDad\u2026 As for this, you can\u2019t blame us for that person surely came prepared and that person\u2019s skill could be on par with chief of the \u2018Silver Hands Group\u2019. Even second brother failed to discover it and it can be clearly seen just how good that person\u2019s skill is.\u201d Being the person who had suffered the most lost, Shen Jing had a bitter face as he explained.In seeing that Shen Jing had mention about the \u2018Silver Hand\u2019, Shen Feng slightly frowned because the \u2018Silver Hand\u2019 was a group of robbers with enormous reputation on the Guangming continent. It was said that each and every one member of theirs had a completely exceptional skill and among the \u2018Silver Hand\u2019, the chief was the strongest. According to the rumours, so long as there are things that he had fancied, then there would never be one that could not be stolen.\u201cDon\u2019t tell me it is the people from the \u2018Silver Hand\u2019\u2026\u201d Shen Yifeng couldn\u2019t help but to mutter out for the loss he had for yesterday was not small.\u201cIt can\u2019t be so.\u201d Shen Feng swung his hand as he said, \u201cThe \u2018Silver Hand\u2019 was located far from Godly Wind Alliance. Even if there are members that are mingling at Long Xuan Empire, they would only just be small fries that are too inferior to be shown to the public and they would simply be unable to conceal themselves from your attention then advancing in stealing.\u201d\u201cThen could it be the chief of the \u2018Silver Hand\u2019?\u201d Shen Yue asked.Shen Feng shaked his head.\u201cAlthough that person was arrogant, it is still unlikely to go as far to be impudent at Long Xuan Empire and oppose the Vermillion Bird clan. In addition to that, according to the urge of his, he would surely send a notification in advance to every target that he has made.\u201dIn eliminating the possibility of the \u2018Silver Hand\u2019, everyone was even more at a loss. Could it be that on this world, was there still any other thief with excellent stealing technique that had not been admitted into the \u2018Silver Hand\u2019?Liked it?

There was no need to talk about \u201cthat\u201d certain thief joining the \u2018Silver Hand\u2019 for at this moment, as it was very likely \u201cthat\u201d certain thief still had never heard of the \u2018Silver Hand\u2019.During this moment when everyone from the Vermillion Bird clan had been at their wits\u2019 end about yesterday\u2019s matter, where they had been collectively been plundered, a certain little thief was returning from a rewarding journey. That certain little thief sat on top of that pile of stolen goods and was beaming with pleasure as she was listing down the harvest she had this time.People like Shen Duan had an illustrious identity and so, the amount of money in his hands was naturally not less. However, the true huge amount of money of his would all be stored in the credit institutions and so, the amount of money that he would carry on his body would simply be not a lot. Therefore, the amount of money that she had looted this time around would simply be regarded as not huge at all but the highlight were actually those precious stones and golden tools that she had seized her chance is bringing them back.However, the question was how would she exchange them into money?She could only consider sending them to the auction houses. After that, the people from the auction houses would naturally exchange those goods into equivalent value of money and delivered those money into her pocket.Merely, the problem was that she could try her very best in making it so that those things would not have any special way to distinguish them but could it be possible that those owners of the Vermillion Bird clan would not be able to recognise their lost items. She was quite confident that the people from the Vermillion Bird clan would not publicise this matter. After all, this matter would severely harm the prestige of the Vermillion Bird clan. However, it simply was not impossible that they would privately inquire the auction houses regarding the seller of these goods,Although those information regarding the sellers are somewhat protected, those general auction houses would leak out some information as it was difficult for them to protect against the powers of the Vermillion Bird clan.Therefore, if she wanted to sell off these things, then she had to find an auction house where the Vermillion Bird clan would not be able to ask and obtain any information out of it.The Vermillion Bird clan was situated at the imperial capital of the Long Xuan Empire. Within that big imperial capital, there were a dozen or more auction houses, yet there were 3 which were of a considerable scale. Within these three, one of them was opened by the Qilin clan which was one of the 5 big clans which was the Qilin Auction House.Although the Vermillion Bird clan and the Qilin clan were members of the 5 big clans, with everything that she had heard at the main room at that day, she was certain that the big 5 clans may have seem to be polite and amicable on the surface but it was likely that they already hated each other to teeth gnashing degrees in private.If she was to auction those things at the Qilin Auction House, it was certain that even if the people from the Vermillion Bird clan had discovered those stolen goods, it was very likely that it would be an inconvenience to inquire about the seller of those goods because they knew that if they asked, the people from the Qilin clan would also absolutely not tell them even one word.Regarding those riches of the human race, Xiu simply did not have any interest in them. The only sole thing that he was interested was whether he was able to exchange these things for sufficient amount of crystallic nuclei or not.As for Shen Yanxiao\u2019s divine stealing skill, although there was some doubt in him, he still simply decided not to ask much about it.Since she had set the QIlin Auction House as the target, Shen Yanxiao then couldn\u2019t help but to make the next step of planning. Although there were very less people who had seen the shame of the Vermillion Bird clan, it was hard to say that she would not be recognised out by the people of the Qilin clan at other locations sometime later. Therefore, Shen Yanxiao had decided on the spot to go to another auction house in advance and used the money that she had and bought a few bottles of face changing medicine.The face changing medicine was a rather common kind of medicine and had three subdivisions to it which were the \u2018low\u2019, \u2018middle\u2019 and \u2018high\u2019. Different subdivisions of the face changing medicine would all have a different duration for the disguise and their price would have even more disparity.On that night, Shen Yanxiao just wore a huge mantle and slipped out of the Vermilion Bird clan. She then ran up to a small auction house which was located at the center of the imperial capital and bought five bottles of low level face changing medicine. Don\u2019t look down on these 5 bottles of face changing medicine for just these 5 small bottles had already cost Shen Yanxiao to spend 500 gold and this had made Shen Yanxiao who had low supply of money to feel pain on her flesh for a moment.Liked it?

However, to Shen Yanxiao, that amount of time was already enough.For convenience purposes, she still bought an inferior storage ring.Storage rings were a type of spatial goods. There may seem to be no difference from an ordinary ring but so long as the holder opened it according to a particular manner, there would certainly be a fixed area of space emerging out which could be used to any non living substance.At Guangming Continent, storage rings were very common goods and it was merely that, a different grade of storage ring would have a different size of space in it.With the dimension of space as basis, every one storage ring would also had an entirely different price. As for the storage ring that Shen Yanxiao had bought, it was a of a middle grade storage ring and the space within it was roughly about five cubic meter which was enough to store those stolen goods that were in her room.With everything ready and all she needed was an east wind, Shen Yanxiao slipped back to the Vermillion Bird clan. She then had those stolen goods and face changing medicine deposited into the storage ring. After that, she leapt back on her bed. [Note: With everything ready and all she needed was an east wind basically means that everything was ready except for the most crucial thing. This was an idiom based on this story]In waiting till around tomorrow\u2019s nightfall, she would only go to the Qilin Auction House to exchange for her genuine \u2018first pot of gold\u2019 at this life of hers!The Qilin Auction House was located at the north side of the imperial capital and had an enormous floor area. It was also the richest and had a famous reputation among the 3 auction houses. All of this was because behind it was the Qilin clan which was extremely well received in the imperial capital. Everyone all knew that within these big 5 clans, the Qilin clan was the richest among them all. This was because at that time when the Qilin clan was being established, the founder of the Qilin clan had used his status to launch a trading activity that covered the nation. With several hundred of years of accumulation, the amount of wealth that they had produced was so much that it could not be counted.There was once a rumour that the Qilin clan\u2019s storehouse could be compared to the state treasury.The nightfall arrived with the moon suspended high upwards.The auction houses belonging to the Qilin clan was brightly lit for the quiet night was precisely the time when the auction house was most lively. Numerous buyers came quite early to the auction house with each one of them sitting at the hall.Within that big auction house, it was quickly jam packed with the previous competitive tender customers.At the rear of the Qilin Auction House\u2019s hall, a youngster of the age approximately 16 or 17 years old was sitting upright on that chair that was spreaded with the tiger skin and was lazily folding his legs. The peerless attractiveness on the face had carried a trace of indolent and that pair of narrow phoenix eyes were hanging low as he looked at the list of items that were handed over by the person who was in charge of the auction house.\u201cIs that all?\u201d That attractive juvenile raised his eyebrows for today\u2019s items that were to be auctioned were somewhat unconcerned.Qi Meng who was barely fifty years old was the person who was in charge of the Qilin Auction House. The aloof and remote him of the past days at this moment was standing before the juvenile with his head filled with cold sweat and did not dare to take a deep breath.\u201cThird young master, the number of trusted customers that were auction selling were simply not a lot. However, I have contacted the people from the Feng Qi(Phoenix Perching) City. Not long after a few days, they will appoint a man right away to send those precious things.\u201d Qi Meng continuously wiped the cold sweat that was on his head. It was not that he was making a big fuss out of the small problem but rather it was the juvenile that was before his eyes. That juvenile was not an ordinary person for he, Qi Xia, the third young master was already formulated to be the next clan head by the current clan head of the Qilin clan!The richness of the Qilin clan was world renowned. However, every single one of the clan head had to have an achievement in some extent at the trading industry and only then could they take up the position. Within all of the members in this generation, the third young master was the one that had the strongest capability. With the age that was barely sixteen years old, he had already accumulated a monumental amount of capital for himself. Even those few trading commercials that were recently built on the Long Xuan Empire within this recent few years were secretly all brought about by the third young master.It could be said that within nearly up to this past hundred years, Qi Xia could be regarded as the number 1 genius in trading of the Qilin Clan. Even if it was a pair of broken copper and scrap iron, he would be able to sell it at sky high price after they had went through his hands.Liked it?

This was because apart from the prestige of the Qilin clan, much more of it was due to the fact that most of the goods that were sold at the Qilin Auction House were goods that were extremely hard to show up in other auction houses. Within the Long Xuan Empire, everyone all knew that all of the best goods had to be brought to the QIlin Auction House because not only was the gold commissioned comparatively lowered but also because the Qilin clan had extremely wide connections. So, those entrusted goods that were auctioned could absolutely be sold at a price that far exceeded one\u2019s expectations.\u201cMany thanks for third young master\u2019s \u2018flattering\u2019.\u201d Qi Meng swallowed his saliva. Although he was confronting a juvenile that was only sixteen years old, the oppression that Qi Xia had given to him didn\u2019t pale in comparison to the oppression given off by the current clan head of the Qilin ClanThe sound of a door knocking had broken off the feeling of oppression that was suffocating Qi Meng.\u201cCome in.\u201d Qi Xia said.The attendant of the auction house had came in after those words. He then respectfully said, \u201cReporting to the third young master, a little customer had came saying that there was a batch of goods that would be entrusted to us to be auctioned off.\u201d\u201cA little customer?\u201d Qi Xia slightly raised his eyes. In smiling, he said, \u201cSince it is a customer, might as well bring the customer in.\u201d\u201cThird young master\u2026\u201d Qi Meng was startled for it couldn\u2019t have been that the third young master would personally prepare himself to receive this person?Qi Xia gave a quick glance at Qi Meng and Qi Meng then didn\u2019t dare to say anything anymore.\u2026\u2026Shen Yanxiao stood at the entrance of the Qilin Auction House. In seeing the rear view of the attendant leaving, Shen Yanxiao was subconsciously touching that little face of hers that had changed beyond recognition.The result of the low level face changing medicine was pretty good. Although the effectiveness was shortened by that bit for that given period of time, it was just enough to conform to her requirement for the three hours were enough for her to have those goods delegated. If there was even more effectiveness for a given period of time, she truly would not know how she would carry that kind of face back to the Vermillion Bird clan.The present Shen Yanxiao\u2019s facial appearance was slightly better when compared to her original unprepossessing look. Not only was the skin slightly fairer, even the five sense of organs of hers too had a variation that was not small. On a whole, although she could not be considered as to be too beautiful, she still could be considered to be delicate and pretty. Then, adding on with the man\u2019s cloth that she had meticulously put on, it would seem like she would resemble of an average joe. However, in order to fool the people, Shen Yanxiao had thoroughly added a piece of \u2018heightening pad\u2019 in her little boots and this kind of things that were only invented out during the civilised society which was pretty useful in this world. [TLN: Basically heightening pad is something like insoles]As of now, not only had she altered the appearance and the gender, even the height of hers was too given a little bit of change. It was reckoned that even if Shen Siyu who was the closed to her was to past by her side, he too would not be able to any bit of clues.After a few moments, the attendant that had previously went to inform had returned then inviting her to enter the rear hall of the auction house to discuss on the specific matters.Shen Yanxiao followed after the attendant in proceeding towards the rear hall. Along the way, her eyes had incessantly swept past those attendants that were coming back and forth where the flickering vision of hers had swept past every single one item that was waiting to be auctioned which were delivered by the attendants to the front hall.That feeling off seeing but not touching had made Shen Yanxiao who had critical occupational disease made her hands itchy.Liked it?

After hearing that languid sound, only then did the attendant opened the door and lifted the arms in inviting Shen Yanxiao to enter.Just as she was to enter into the rear hall, Shen Yanxiao had right away saw a handsome youngster that was sitting on that tiger skin chair like how a cat would be as it lay down at the balcony basking under the afternoon sun. That pair of grinning eyes of his were as bright as the convergence of the stars and there seemed to be as if there was no smiling expression hanging at the corner of his mouth while he was lazily supporting his chin single handedly.During the moment when Qi Xia saw Shen Yanxiao, he was clearly staring blankly for a moment. He finally knew why the attendant had said that \u2018he\u2019 was \u2018a little customer\u2019.That thin and weak body that was wrapped under the plain and simple clothing. On the delicate and pretty face was that pair of clear eyes flickering out the ignorance of not having gone through the ways of the world and also sincerity. Just with the regards to the height alone, the little bastard before his eyes was very likely had not reached to his shoulder and at most would have only have the look of a thirteen to fourteen yeared old. It was no wonder that the little bastard was said to be a \u2018little customer\u2019.\u201cHello, I am Qi Meng, the person who is in charge of here. May I know what goods do this customer have that would be entrusted to us, the Qilin Auction House to be sold?\u201d As for this kind of matter of receiving the customer, Qi Meng would seriously not dare to trouble Qi Xia to personally open his mouth and so Qi Meng immediately put out the loftiness of being the person in charge of the Qilin Auction House as he politely spoke.\u201cOh, I have got a batch of precious stones and golden tools which I have wanted to entrust to you to sell. Is there any procedure that needs to be done?\u201d There was this very strange feeling. Although the middle aged man before her had given her this feeling of a firm and steady experienced old man, Shen Yanxiao had nevertheless subconsciously felt that the youngster that was sitting at his side was truly the one whose words held the most authority at here.Qi Meng smiled as he said, \u201cJust what kind of golden tools and precious stone are they? This customer ought to have came to our Qilin Auction House for the first time and therefore did not have a great understanding towards the practices of our sides. Our Qilin Auction House auctions an extremely few amount golden tools and precious stones. Unless they are extremely precious, we would only make an exception in selling them.\u201dJust what kind of scale was the Qilin Auction House was at. If all those little gadgets could be brought to be auctioned, then even if the auction house was to expand by ten folds, it was very likely that it was still insufficient. What was more was that those common types of luxury goods could already be obtained at other auction houses and they, the Qilin Auction House was certainly never fond of taking over those \u2018staple goods\u2019.Were it not for the fact that treasures in general were not easy to be obtained, or else, they would also not have taken one of the spot as 3 biggest auction houses in the imperial capital.Shen Yanxiao stared blankly for she truly indeed did not know of the practices of the Qilin Auction Houses. With the foresight of hers, these things that she had swept whether it was the crafts or the quality were all completely pretty good but she precisely did not know on just how was the norm of this world\u2019s appraisal.\u201cAs for this, I am also not sure. I will take it out and have you see them.\u201d Being disinclined to think of these details, Shen Yanxiao straightforwardly opened the storage ring that was on her finger that would have all of the things inside poured out.Qi Meng had originally thought that a little bastard like this at most would have only taken a few things and that would have been very amazing.Along in the midst of the storage ring where the golden tools and precious stones pouring down in torrents in unbroken succession, they had formed a pile of small mountain on the floor. In the eyes of Qi Meng was the looks of him showing amazement.With that many of golden tools and precious stones, even if they were all inferior in quality, they could be exchanged into a quite sum of money. With Qi Meng\u2019s experienced foresight to see, each one of those golden tools that were sprinkling on to the ground were a work an art that was produced by the hands of the renowned experts. As for those precious stones tumbling everywhere, each one of them even more had an unadulterated quality and they were absolutely the most upper grade of a precious stones.This kind of a batch of a huge number of luxury goods were unexpectedly taken out from a rather ordinary little bastard. It truly made people to be somewhat startled.Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In his heart, he couldn\u2019t help but to be somewhat nervous. Although these luxury goods were objectively expensive, they weren\u2019t worth much in the eyes of the Qilin Auction House.However when quantity was turned into quality, that pile of luxury goods which at the very least consisted of hundreds of them before his eyes was sufficient to achieve an astonishing figure.Just where did this little demon had gotten these goods from?In Qi Meng\u2019s thoughts, there was some suspicions but he too had not reveal it out for the Qilin Auction House would never get involved with the history of the entrusted goods. Moreover, previously, he had also seen before many customers that had brought in treasures and they were dressed extremely plain and simple as for most of the time, it was to for the purpose of fooling others.\u201cThat\u2019s all. Have a look and see whether they are suitable or not.\u201d Shen Yanxiao could not grasp accurately on the system of values of this world and also did not know of the standards of the QIlin Auction House. Therefore, she could only wait quietly for Qi Meng to appraise. If the Qilin Auction House truly would not take over these goods, then she reckoned that she could only send them in little batches to other auction houses. Moreover, in order to avoid the Vermillion Bird clan\u2019s attention, she had to be more careful. Thus, not only would the speed in accumulating wealth distinctly drop but it could also lead to more inconveniences.Qi Meng nodded his head then calling out for a few golden tool appraising masters and precious stones appraising masters to enter and conducting appraisals on this pile of precious stones before his eyes.As expected, each and everyone of those precious stones and golden tools were at an exceedingly top notch quality and as for these grade of quality of treasure, Qi Meng could have only seen them inside his own clan, the Qilin clan.It was just that\u2026\u201cThe value of these things were extremely precious and it was just that\u2026 these few pieces of precious stones had some abrasion. It appeared as if it was not a finished product on its own but rather more of a portion of finished goods.\u201d The precious stone appraising master said as the hand of his was holding onto a few pieces of thumb sized precious stones.In looking at that few pieces of precious stones that were in the hands of the precious stones appraising master, Shen Yanxiao was silently recalling back the scene where she herself at that time had them ripped off from Shen Jing\u2019s jewelry box.\u201cSo, could these things be auctioned out at here or not?\u201d These kind of insignificant details were nevertheless better to be directly overlooked for what she had cared more about for was that whether the QIlin Auction House was going to take over these goods of hers or not.Being the person in charge of the Qilin Auction House, Qi Meng could naturally make an accurate estimate on the worth of this batch of goods.Based on the standards only, this batch of goods could only be barely enough to reach the \u2018dispensable\u2019 standards of the Qilin Auction House. However, what he had truly cared about was the power behind the back of this little youngster.To be able to take out that many of luxury goods at one time was absolutely not what an ordinary people could have been able to do it in general.After weighing the pros and cons, Qi Meng smiled as he said, \u201cThey are okay. If this customer has the time, as of now, we could go and sign the agreement right away. We would have this batch of goods arranged to be auctioned off as soon as possible.\u201d\u201cVery well.\u201d Shen Yanxiao nodded her head.It had to be said that the Qilin Auction House did handle their works quite efficiently. Not even after a moment, Qi Meng and Shen Yanxiao had signed the agreement. The details of the agreement were awfully simple which were that the Qilin Auction House would be in charge in auctioning the goods that Shen Yanxiao had entrusted them to and after auctioning off the goods, the Qilin Auction House would receive 10% of the profits and the rest of the profits would be given to the Shen Yanxiao.After signing the agreement, Shen Yanxiao simply did not plan to straightforwardly collect the expense that she would get after auction but rather to have a discussion with Qi Meng on whether it was possible or not to borrow from the Qilin Auction House from the gains that she would get from the auction later to buy a certain amount of inferior crystallic nuclei.\u201cAre you sure that you want to have all of your money converted into crystallic nuclei? According to the current assessment, if the total amount of money after having that batch of goods auctioned off was to be converted to inferior crystallic nuclei, it was very likely that it had to be counted in thousands.\u201d Qi Meng couldn\u2019t help but to remind this little customer that having the entire money to purchase the inferior crystallic nuclei in one time would result in a tremendous amount of them. Moreover, the usage of the crystallic nuclei was simply not huge at all and therefore, it was very rare to have people buying them in a big batch.Liked it?

The amount of the crystallic nuclei that she needed was up to 30000. To her, this figure of up to thousands could simply not be counted as anything.\u201cI am sure. As for the commission that the QiIin Auction House ought to receive, you could use it for yourself.\u201d Regarding the matter in the field of business, Shen Yanxiao was a layman but she believed that with the reputation of the Qilin clan that he simply would not covet for that little amount of money in the hand of hers.Since the employer was already that determined, Qi Meng naturally would not speak much about it. Once again, after signing an agreement, this time around, Shen Yanxiao\u2019s objective could be considered to be accomplished perfectly.It was just that, the thing that had made her somewhat curious was that youngster that was continuously sitting inside the rear hall and all along, he had used that pair of eyes that were concentrated with interest to look at her.Even after she had changed her appearance which was much more better than before, however, at most, it could also only could only be counted as delicate and when compared to that juvenile, it was simply as different as heaven and earth. If it was said that the counterpart was a female, then she could perhaps comprehend as of why the counterpart had showned a little interest towards her appearance.However, he obviously was a handsome youngster that was much more good-looking than her in countless folds!As a handsome youth, why aren\u2019t you staring at pretty girls, but staring at this \u2018new fresh girl\u2019 of the same gender for?In assessing that the time of the face changing medicine would be running out, Shen Yanxiao had no intention to stay any longer. After giving another few courteous words to Qi Meng, she got out as soon as possible.With the eyes of his following onto that petite figure who was hastily leaving, Qi Xia couldn\u2019t help it but to give a light smile.\u201cThird young master?\u201d Qi Meng suspiciously looked at Qi Xia\u2019s sudden arrival of his smiling expression. In the bottom of his heart, he was somewhat gooseflesh.Qi Xia lazily shot a glance at him and said, \u201cWhat are your thoughts on the goods that this little bastard had brought?\u201dWas the third young master testing his eyesight? Qi Meng immediately put forth an extreme amount of thought into it as he said, \u201cAll of the goods are of the top-notch quality. To be able to take tremendous amount of luxury goods in one go, this customer\u2019s influence is certainly not small. Therefore, this subordinate would only be bold to continue on this business transaction. Moreover, according to the his last request which was the purchase of that huge batch of crystallic nuclei, they definitely are bound to have another usage for them. With that huge amount of crystallic nuclei, even if there were up to hundreds of people using them, they would be unable to use it up. It is very likely that a certain big clan had wanted to acquire the crystallic nuclei in the dark to temper their members.\u201dQi Meng\u2019s analysis was very sensible for the advantage of the crystallic nuclei lied in its price being cheap and the negative effect of the low level crystallic nuclei was not high. Therefore, it was very fitting to be used on those few clans that were unable to buy a large batch of weapons that were applied with the fusion of the magic nuclei to temper their members.After having finished listening, Qi Xia only laughed and indifferently said, \u201cInfluence is not small.\u201dThat huge amount of luxury goods were absolutely not what an ordinary rich household could obtain. Having placing his eyes onto that may golden tools that were within that pile, all of them were sufficient to be equal compared to the gadgets in his room. As for this grade of quality of golden tools, there were only three to four gold shops in the Long Xuan Empire that could make them out. Moreover, most of these finished goods from these gold shops would all enter into each and every major powers within the imperial capital and in just concentrating on to the proportion of the 5 big clans, they took up most of the proportions.However, with the financial resources of the 5 big clans, it was simply unlikely for them to go as far to auction these golden tools to obtain wealth.Qi Meng\u2019s judgement was not wrong but he had overlooked one point which was those badly damaged precious stones that he had neglected. Although their quality were original, would there be anyone from the clan that would have paced these badly damaged goods together with the pile of luxury goods to be sold?The corner of Qi Xia\u2019s mouth curved into a smiling expression with interest. Towards the history of these goods, he had already guessed most of the parts.To be able to get hold on these grade of quality and quantity of luxury goods, that youngster\u2019s technique was seriously out of the ordinary!Liked it?

    "Chapter 33": "Chapter 33 Searching For Targets Again Part 3Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.eu\u2026 \u2026Being perfectly content by having completed the first business deal, Shen Yanxiao returned to the Vermillion Bird clan in an especially good mood. During the next several days, the cultivation of her Dou Qi and magic was especially satisfactory.During this period of self-cultivation, Shen Jiayi finally managed to reinstate her health. It was merely that on the day that she\u2019d threatened Shen Yanxiao, the raging blaze had completely burned away all of her hair and her eyebrows. The current head of Shen Jiayi was similar to an egg \u2014 where, apart from the her facial features, had a bare surface upon her head.This had thoroughly caused Shen Jiayi, who loved to be beautiful, to crumple. For the entire day, she incessantly wailed, and wasn\u2019t even willing to take a step out of her room at all. As for what had exactly happened on that very day, Shen Jiayi tightly closed her mouth, and was absolutely unwilling to speak. This made Shen Yue, who had the intention to cause trouble for Shen Yanxiao, also have no place where he could make a move.Shen Yue could only visit all of the nearby auction houses and use huge amounts of money in order to buy medicine that could make her hair grow faster, and that would also easily save Shen Jiayi\u2019s bare head.Shen Feng couldn\u2019t have another mishap in the invitation of the sage, so he immediately sent people to have the Snow Spiritual Fox delivered to the God\u2019s Domain. Not long afterwards, he then received information that had arrived from the God\u2019s Domain.In 10 days, the sage of the God\u2019s Domain would personally proceed towards the Long Xuan Empire, to the Vermillion Bird Clan, in order to rouse the Vermillion Bird.This one piece of information had everyone from the Vermillion Bird Clan crying tears of joy.Their hundred years of misery would finally be seen through to an end.Within these 10 days, everyone put out an extreme amount of effort, and it was a rarely seen sight where the elders and the youngsters of the Vermillion Bird Clan integrated together to make concentrated efforts. They were properly ensuring that on the day that the sage arrived, they could give the sage a superb impression.As for Shen Yifeng, Shen Jiayi, and Shen Jiawei, who were entitled to compete for the right in inheriting the Vermillion Bird, they were more focused with closed door lessons, brought on by their respective fathers. After all, for the few of them, this one opportunity was too hard to come by, and in case one of them succeeded, it would then be \u2018reaching the heavens in a single bound\u2019. (instant success)In another 10 days time, the Vermillion Bird Clan would once again reach the summit, and would embrace the honor that had been lost for a long time once again.As for Shen Yanxiao, who completely didn\u2019t have any relations with the Vermillion Bird whatsoever, was there any relation to her as to whether or not the sage came? With each and every one of them being so busy, she was even more happy to leisurely take some time out of her day that was normally spent painstakingly cultivating Dou Qi and magic, in order to make a trip to the Qilin Auction House to have 3728 crystallic nuclei brought back that had prepared by Qi Meng.On the way to collect the crystallic nuclei, she naturally forgot to change her appearance, and this time around, she didn\u2019t come across that handsome youngster again. Actually, because of that delightful cooperation, Qi Meng had given her a high grade storage ring as a present, which had a storage space of up to a hundred cubic meters. There wasn\u2019t a need to speak about that trifling 3728 crystallic nuclei anymore \u2014 even if there were 30,000 of them all together, she could still have easily stored them inside.Shen Yanxiao was very suspicious towards Qi Meng\u2019s sudden arrival and his expression of his goodwill, but not seizing the advantage was the act of an idiot. What was more was that Qi Meng was completely ignorant of Shen Yanxiao\u2019s status. This type of good thing had many advantages and no disadvantages. Therefore, if she didn\u2019t receive it, then she was precisely an idiot.Three thousand plus inferior crystallic nuclei were brought back to the Vermillion Bird clan by Shen Yanxiao. She impatiently closed the door of her room, and within the storage ring, she grabbed hold of a handful of crystallic nuclei in preparation to feed a certain great master.However, quite regretfully, Xiu simply didn\u2019t have any special moves at all, for he was still existing inside Shen Yanxiao\u2019s body. Therefore, he could only absorb the power within the crystallic nuclei through the means of Shen Yanxiao.As she saw the crystallic nuclei within the her hands change into strand after strand of daybreak light and enter the space between her eyebrows, Shen Yanxiao felt that it was exceedingly wonderful.In only one night, Xiu had used all of the crystallic nuclei. It was a pity that this speck of an amount, in regards to him, simply wasn\u2019t counted as anything at all.Liked it?

After that last event with the Vermillion Bird Clan, it had been guarded much closer. Although the power of the people that were guarding was only akin to a piece of fleeting cloud in the eyes of Shen Yanxiao, she knew that if she was to make her move this time around, it was very likely, if not guaranteed, that Shen Feng would pull some drastic things. After all, the sage would arrive very soon, and everyone from the Vermillion Bird Clan couldn\u2019t afford to show any mistakes.However, apart from the Vermillion Bird Clan, what other places were there that could let her obtain a huge amount of wealth rapidly?In nearly a split second, an exquisite idea flashed through Shen Yanxiao\u2019s mind.If one viewed it broadly, besides the other 4 big clans, were there anyone that could match the Vermillion Bird Clan throughout the entire Imperial Capital?A sinister smile floated onto Shen Yanxiao\u2019s face, which was gradually accompanied with an unrestrained, demonic smile. With the Azure Dragon Clan being the head of the other clan, it would be the same for the Vermillion Bird Clan; it would be the cusp of welcoming a miserable fate.\u2026 \u2026Regarding the 5 big clans in the Imperial Capital, it was an unstable period of time. Following after the Vermillion Bird Clan\u2019s suffering from the evil scheme, the Azure Dragon Clan, the White Tiger Clan, and the Black Tortoise Clan all suffered from a \u2018visit\u2019 from a conscienceless little thief, all in succession. Except for the Qilin clan, who had escaped by sheer luck.In order to prevent the loss of the clan\u2019s face and honor, the 3 big clans remained matter tight-lipped like the Vermillion Bird Clan about the stealing matter. Apart from the members of the clan that knew that their own clan had been robbed, fundamentally no outsider knew about it.Just like this, it caused the 5 big clans to be mutually unaware that the other clans had been robbed, and they could only regard it as personal misfortune that had struck their clans. The clans couldn\u2019t deal with having this scandal propagating outside, or with the word reaching the ears of the other clans. So the 4 big clans could only eat their loss and yield by not having the others know of it. On the surface, it couldn\u2019t be seen that there was the slightest bit of restlessness, but in the dark, the clans had reinforced their manpower and were secretly advancing the tracking down of the whereabouts of the lost goods.Of course, their investigations eventually all lead them to one of the five big clans, the Qilin Clan\u2019s Auction House.If the 4 clans that had suffered from heavy losses were able to calm down, sit down together, and discuss, they would\u2019ve discovered that the stealing event that had occurred to the clans, had an astonishing point of resemblance.Out of all of the goods that they\u2019d lost, all of them had some worth that was considerable, be it golden tools, or precious stones. Although these goods were expensive, it wouldn\u2019t cause any kind of damage to any of the clans. Actually, amongst every clan that had collected rare treasures, as of now, all of these rare treasures were still safely placed in their storeroom without having moved a tiny bit.However, after this one event, every clan was like a bird that had been startled by the mere twang of a bow, and every clan\u2019s storeroom simultaneously had its surveillance increased by three times.Who knew whether or not this little thief had only come previously in order to inspect and did not have any preparations. The next time the little thief came, it would not only be that softhearted anymore. Any of the goods that were in their storerooms were priceless, and losing one of them was already enough to cause them to vomit 3 litres of blood!One day after another, the 4 big clans went through it while being anxious and frightened, as it seemed as if that conscienceless thief had faded away, and no longer appeared within their line of sight.Actually, during this period of time, Qi Meng from the Qilin Auction House had taken over batch after batch of luxury goods that had been sent by Shen Yanxiao.After seeing the gold, silver, and precious stones that were piling up like a mountain, Qi Meng sincerely had the urge to weep, for within this period of time, the gold, silver, and precious stones that were sent by this customer had already nearly matched the quantity of the luxury goods of the Qilin Clan. Towards this batch of luxury goods that were being delivered wave upon wave, Qi Meng truly wanted to take the hand of customer and beg him whether or not he could change to a different kind of goods that could be sent. With this huge amount being sold , the people within the imperial capital would all believe that the Qilin Auction House had wanted to change to selling luxury goods.Liked it?

    "Chapter 35": "Chapter 35 Frenzied Part 2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euWhen Shen Yanxiao made her move on the Vermillion Bird Clan, due to the theory that \u2018one shouldn\u2019t do anything to harm to one\u2019s neighbors\u2019, she\u2019d only had a little test of her skill, and hadn\u2019t been too heartless by exploiting them too much. As for the other 3 big clans however, it was an entirely different story.The reason for her doing what she\u2019d done\u2026Was to truly seize an opportunity that had presented itself! Her ferocity had exponentially increased, until it capable of making one\u2019s hair stand up in anger.For example, on a certain young master\u2019s bedside that was from the Azure Dragon Clan, where the 7-star sword was hung, the lavish scabbard of the sword had been entirely cleaned of its dazzling precious stones and its gilded golden ornaments.Another example was a certain wide jade chessboard, that was within a certain madam\u2019s hall that was in the White Tiger Clan, which had all of the chess pieces and the chessboard disappear without a trace. Even the 2 cases that\u2019d been created using gold in order to store the chess pieces had been taken away.Another example was a certain lady\u2019s dark blue crystal chain and bracelet that hung on her arm and neck, that were in the Black Tortoise Clan\u2026It had to be known that both the necklace and bracelet were a present for the young lady of the Black Tortoise Clan upon her reaching adulthood. Even when she was bathing or sleeping, they never left her body. The outcome was still that when she was sleeping, they\u2019d been taken away by someone, just like that. The only thing they knew, was that, from the body of young lady, the certainly utterly heartless thief had directly, and personally\u2026taken them away.This matter directly caused a certain matchless and chaste young lady to despair, and nearly caused her to bang her head to death at her bedside. In the end, to protect her purity, the clan head of the Black Tortoise Clan forcibly obstructed her; so much so, that the clan leader privately gave a command: In case the little thief was discovered, that thief definitely wasn\u2019t allowed to be killed, and instead had to be brought back to their residence..Was this the precursor to a certain young lady wanting to get married?In short, the chaotic panic that the 3 big clans had experienced during these past few days, was all due to a certain heartless thief who was frenziedly raking in money!It was also because of Shen Yanxiao\u2019s fierce movements these three times \u2014 and only with the help of these 3 fierce movements \u2014 that the number of crystalline nuclei in her hands had reached twenty thousand plus. Adding on the two thousand or so pieces that had previously been used by Xiu, there was only a difference of five thousand pieces before she reached the 30000 mark!Seeing these twenty thousand plus pieces of crystalline nuclei be absorbed by Xiu, Shen Yanxiao\u2019s heart was like Spring in March \u2014 filled with brilliant flowers.Looking at the seal on her arm, Shen Yanxiao could practically imagine the scene of herself facing upwards and laughing, as she\u2019d be able to collect 30000 pieces of crystalline nuclei to feed Xiu, the great master, within just few days, and the second layer of seal would be undone.Only, who\u2019d be the one \u2018paying\u2019 for these last 5000 pieces of low level crystalline nuclei?She wouldn\u2019t consider the Qilin Clan. Although there was a rumor that said that the Qilin Clan was extremely wealthy, it wasn\u2019t good for her to steal their goods and then bring them to their own auction house.As for the other 4 clans, she\u2019d made her move too fiercely, and estimated that she wouldn\u2019t be able to peel off much profit from their bodies during this short period of time, thus she directly skipped them.So, with her surveying the entire imperial capital, it was very likely that there was only one place that would be able to have her break even in a single go.The imperial palace!Within the imperial palace, a certain old man who had a precious stone crown on his head. was suddenly struck with a cold shiver.\u2026 \u2026It was quite a pity that, before Shen Yanxiao could extend her evil claws to the imperial palace, the sage\u2019s troops from the God\u2019s Domain had already arrived at the imperial capital of the Long Xuan Empire.The arrival of the sage from the God\u2019s Domain startled all of the influential officials within the imperial capital.From the monarch of the Long Xuan Empire, to the ordinary commoners, all of them were incessantly excited because of the arrival of the sage.The God\u2019s Domain was an extremely peculiar existence. It simply didn\u2019t belong to anyone of the Guangming continent, instead standing alone on a piece of land that bordered the sea where its area wasn\u2019t too large. It also didn\u2019t have an enormous amount of troops to act as a military force to safeguard itself. However, nevertheless, none of the other countries would dare to even somewhat object to the existence of the God\u2019s Domain.Liked it?

As for the guardsmen that were standing above the city walls, they set off festive fireworks, and the melodious sound of a trombone resonated throughout the entire horizon.The sky was ravaged with fireworks as they blossomed above in broad daylight. Even if it was still daytime, after undergoing the modification of magicians, the fireworks still blossomed out with radiance that was dazzling to the eye.The monarch of the Long Xuan Empire personally brought a troop to welcome the sage, and when everyone prostrated down in worship, the monarch welcomed the sage into the Imperial Palace.The liveliness that was accompanied with clamor was nevertheless, unrelated to Shen Yanxiao.Because she was the shame of the Vermillion Bird Clan, she wasn\u2019t permitted to appear in the presence of the sage at all. Thus, she alone remained inside the Vermillion Bird Clan\u2019s mansion.She somewhat gloomily sat on her bed, but it wasn\u2019t because she couldn\u2019t meet some bullsh*t sage; rather it was because as of now, the sage had entered the Imperial Palace. The plan of her going to the Imperial Palace and taking advantage of a crisis for her own personal gain could only be temporarily halted.During the time where everyone was crying tears of joy because of the arrival of the sage, a certain little thief whose plan had been disarranged was gnashing her teeth while gazing at that fraud of a sage.This was because it was an extremely immoral action to disturb other people\u2019s work!According to the usual practice, the sage would need to enter the Imperial Palace on arrival first. Therefore, after having finished the entire welcoming ceremony, Shen Feng brought everyone from the Vermillion Bird Clan to return to the mansion.From the higher up Shen Feng, to to the lower down attendant of the Vermillion Bird Clan, a matchless and complacent smile was brimming on everyone\u2019s face.\u201cHaha, those people of the Azure Dragon Clan are still thinking about just what the sage arrived for. Looking at that face of theirs, if they were to know that the arrival of the sage this time around was to rouse the Vermillion Bird, then they would\u2019ve likely been so angry that it\u2019d have put their mustaches out of bent.\u201d After thinking about the expression the other 4 clan leaders had shown today, Shen Jing, who was following behind Shen Feng, just especially refreshed.Shen Feng had been relatively much more steady since a long time ago\u2014it was a habit for him to not show his feelings when he was happy and angry. However, after what he\u2019d heard and seen today, the corner of his mouth was still unable to conceal the trace of a smile.\u201cDon\u2019t spread it out too much that the sage will be arriving at our residence tomorrow. Have you all prepared what you ought to have prepared?\u201d Shen Feng once more verified.Concerning the reputation of the Vermillion Bird Clan, he had to be careful.\u201cEverything\u2019s prepared.\u201d Shen Duan said.\u201cEn.\u201d Shen Feng nodded his head, satisfied. Immediately, it was as if Shen Feng had remembered something. Turning his head to Shen Duan, Shen Feng said, \u201cHave some of the witty maids sent to Siyu\u2019s place, because all the people that he has are only those few retinues, and it\u2019s not convenient to only have them freshen up that little servant girl.\u201d\u201cEh?\u201d Shen Duan somewhat didn\u2019t understand what had been said, after the sudden arrival of his father\u2019s words made him be at a loss.Shen Feng said, \u201cTomorrow, when the sage comes, the candidates that can make a contract with the Vermillion Bird are to be brought to the lava ravine. Although the little servant girl\u2019s wisdom isn\u2019t much, she can\u2019t be too sloppy and she can\u2019t be lacking in manners in front of the sage.\u201dJust what he\u2019d heard!!!Shen Duan dumbstrokenly stood at his original position as he rigidly gazed at Shen Feng. He was doubting himself on whether his ears had misheard or not.Even if he was an idiot, he too was clear from the words \u2018little servant girl\u2019 that Shen Feng had spoken from his mouth was referring to the disgrace of the Vermillion Bird Clan \u2013 Shen Yanxiao!Liked it?

Was the sun rising from the west today? During the time where it had reached the crucial point and concerned the reputation of the Vermillion Bird Clan, that idiot had unexpectedly been allowed to enter and participate!Was this Shen Feng\u2019s mind addled?Shen Duan\u2019s face went green, for he truly didn\u2019t know how to receive these words. He had a strong desire to tell his father that, from the start, Shen Yanxiao had been an idiot without a whole lot of wisdom. Moreover, she was nevertheless trash that couldn\u2019t cultivate magic or Dou Qi. This wasn\u2019t even mentioning that the probability of her making a contract with the Vermillion Bird was zero. Just that idiotic appearance of hers showing up before the sage\u2026could it be that his father wasn\u2019t worried about losing the Vermillion Bird Clan any face?Shen Duan really wanted to persuade Shen Feng to renounce this outrageous idea. However, Shen Feng simply didn\u2019t give him the chance to reply, and directly walked forward. Actually, when Shen Siyu was passing by Shen Duan, Shen Siyu had said, \u201cThe maid that second uncle sent could immediately and directly be delivered to Yanxiao\u2019s room. In a while, I\u2019ll bring some people there.\u201dWith Shen Duan being the head of the second and third generation of the Vermillion Bird Clan, everyone had a facial expression that seemed to express, \u2018Has the world gone insane, or is it that they\u2019ve gone insane?\u2019 Their eyes followed the two people leaving, one facing forwards and the other one backwards, at the same time.What a world of fantasy this was!Taking on a principle of \u2018It\u2019s none of my business\u2019, Shen Yanxiao was cultivating to one side, and on another side was being a buffoon. From time to time, there was also Shen Siyu who\u2019d send delicate desserts; the days went by free and unfettered.She had just been becoming \u2018a fish back in water\u2019, yet the second day of the sage\u2019s arrival at the imperial capital had smashed it.On the journey towards the main room, Shen Yanxiao lowered her little head and closely followed the back of the maid. She was unable to understand what Shen Feng wanted to do by having her summoned when the sage had arrived to the Vermilion Bird Clan. Could it be that he wasn\u2019t worried of her, the disgrace of the Vermillion Bird Clan defaming their lofty and magnificent image?As she attempted to figure out the answer with distrust, Shen Yanxiao once again arrived at the main room where she\u2019d once played a small role.This time, there was an extra seat next to Shen Feng with a person wearing a pure white cloth. A light blue silk fabric was rolled at the edges of the person\u2019s sleeves, and a few designs using silver coloured thread were adorned on the pure white clothing. It was frugal, yet maintained the sense of delicateness. On that peerlessly handsome face, was a faint smile that could make people feel comfortable, and a pair of eyes which carried a smiling expression that caused people to feel an unprecedented revere and ease.The sage that had came from the God\u2019s Domain was known as the God\u2019s Son by the commoners.Regardless at whichever country it was, his arrival would always receive the people\u2019s reverence and respect.Shen Yanxiao quickly sized up on this world\u2019s biggest \u2018scammer\u2019. She then lowered her head and continued onwards to be herself, the little idiot.Shen could clearly sensed, from the single moment during which she\u2019d been entering the main room, that the younger generations who were sitting on both sides, the left and the right of her, had shot flying gazes\u2014and their gazes on her body after seizing them up, sizing up, weren\u2019t exactly masked at allShen Jiayi was standing behind Shen Yue\u2019s back. The once pretty complexion of hers, as of now, was somewhat pale. Although she\u2019d meticulously applied make up, it had still been unable to cover up that trace of her sorry figure. Her dark long hair had long been in the past. Even after using the few medicines on a daily basis that induced hair growth, generally, it could be considered that a few hairs had sprouted from her head. Merely the length alone was no longer that of an approximate of half a finger in length. No matter how meticulously it was taken care of, the top of her head now resembled an ample lump of chicken nest.It didn\u2019t help that the people also couldn\u2019t help but laugh, for it was like a bald-mane little lion.Shen Jiayi\u2019s gaze was rigidly fixed onto Shen Yanxiao\u2019s body; Shen Jiayi would never forget who\u2019d been the one that\u2019d conferred her miserable appearance of today.Liked it?

What\u2019s more, was that Shen Jiayi was an arrogant and bossy woman. It could be assumed that, during the time that she\u2019d been growing up in the Vermillion Bird Clan, when had she suffered this kind of humiliation?If it weren\u2019t for Shen Feng\u2019s order, it was very likely that Shen Jiayi would\u2019ve carried a blade in long ago, and chopped Shen Yanxiao into minced meat!What she couldn\u2019t understand at all was, on such a great day like this, and with the sage arriving today, just why the disgrace of the Vermillion Bird Clan had appeared here?!Shen Yue\u2019s brows slightly puckered up, as if he could feel his daughter\u2019s anger. After yesterday\u2019s personnel command from Shen Feng, Shen Yue hadn\u2019t had a good night\u2019s sleep, as he couldn\u2019t understand the reason Shen Feng would allow Shen Yanxiao to show up here at all. It had to be known that Shen Yanxiao\u2019s wisdom was merely at the level of a 4-year old child. Even if she didn\u2019t weep or create a disturbance, she couldn\u2019t understand what others spoke. If by any chance she was to make some sort of jest before the sage, wouldn\u2019t it be throwing away the greatest extent of the Vermillion Bird Clan\u2019s face?As for everyone who was on the scene\u2014besides the sage who was unaware of the circumstances, Shen Feng who\u2019d given the order, and Shen Siyu who\u2019d executed the order\u2014they all had their brows puckered up due to Shen Yanxiao\u2018s arrival.Everyone else was worried as to whether or not this disgrace of the Vermillion Bird Clan would lose her clan any face before the sage or not.Usually, they wouldn\u2019t even think of her participating in any of the clan\u2019s activities; there wasn\u2019t even anyone who was willing to call out this good for nothing idiot for the monthly clan\u2019s communal meal activity. Besides, when Shen Siyu had returned, where he would have this idiot brought out and have her appeared before everyone\u2019s line of sight\u2014everyone else had subconsciously forgotten the existence of this idiot.No one wanted to leave behind any kind of bad impression on the sage because of this disgrace.The atmosphere within the main room had become somewhat strange, all of which was due to Shen Yanxiao\u2019s arrival. After she entered the main room, she then quietly and motionlessly stood at her original position, making everyone\u2019s heart bead with cold sweat.Could it be that this idiot wanted to continue standing before the sage without receiving disgust? It had to be known that when those unprepossessing looks of hers were placed within everyone who was good looking, \u2018unbearably ugly\u2019 were simply just the two words used to describe her. This one existence that was a mistake had continuously reminded the Vermillion Bird Clan that she was their disgrace!Shen Duan wanted to open his mouth and have people drag this idiot that was acting recklessly to the side, but the sage who was meditating abruptly smiled and said, \u201cIs this person precisely the seventh young lady of the Vermilion Bird Clan?\u201d That sweet sounding and gentle voice was like a pool of warm spring water as it flowed across everyone\u2019s mind.\u201cIt is precisely her.\u201d Shen Feng nodded his head as he said.\u201cYanxiao\u2019s wisdom is lacking. If there\u2019s been disrespect in anyway, I still hope that the sage will be forgiving.\u201dThe sage smiled as he shook his head.\u201cThis child that I\u2019m seeing gives me quite the familiarity at first sight.\u201dThe sentence from the sage made everyone who\u2019d been worrying that Shen Yanxiao would bring shame to the Vermillion Bird Clan flabbergasted.What had they just heard? The great master, the sage, had unexpectedly said that this idiot had given him a familiar feeling at first sight?!No matter how you saw it, Shen Yanxiao\u2019s appearance was the type that would no longer be found after throwing her to the crowd. The her that was standing within the group of people from the Vermillion Bird Clan was akin to the feeling of a chicken standing inside a flock of cranes.Just how could this have someone feel quite familiar at first glance?Could it be that the taste of this great master, the sage, was slightly \u2018stronger\u2019?Shen Jiayi was even more flabbergasted, for she found it hard to believe that the Shen Yanxiao that she was gazing at, whom couldn\u2019t even be compared to her toes\u2014that kind of an ugly person\u2014would unexpectedly receive the sage\u2019s first handed glance like this.Liked it?

He then lowered himself by bending down at the waist and looked at this little bastard whose head had drooped all along. With a lukewarm smile he said, \u201cHow old are you?\u201dSensing that the sage was approaching, Shen Yanxiao could only act as if she was an \u2018idiot\u2019, and as if she she \u2018couldn\u2019t understand\u2019 the sage\u2019s question. Therefore, she still bowed down her head in a shy manner. Towards this sage that was enough to have everyone prostrate themselves in worship, he was only a \u2018scammer\u2019 that had a lot of influence in Shen Yanxiao\u2019s mind. Regarding the goodwill that had just been expressed by this scammer, Shen Yanxiao only really cared about when he\u2019d rolled out of here and properly give her a chance to enter the imperial palace, so that she could have that last batch of money needed to buy the crystalline nuclei \u2018taken out\u2019.If someone were to know what Shen Yanxiao was thinking as of now, it would\u2019ve been very likely that they would have directly jumped out and had this idiot who couldn\u2019t differentiate good from bad choked to death.Just how high was the prestige of the God\u2019s Domain? Even the monarch of the Long Xuan Empire had to personally welcome them. Not only was this lass not wild with joy, but was actually full of thoughts on having the boss of the God\u2019s Domain leave as soon as possible. These kind of thoughts would have people worried to an extent.\u201cAhem, this year Yanxiao is 14 years old.\u201d With Shen Yanxiao\u2019s wisdom, Shen Feng could only help her answer the question.\u201c14 years old. It appears to be somewhat premature.\u201d The sage softly murmured the sentence. Soon afterwards, he once again faintly smiled as he said, \u201cIt\u2019s not that it\u2019s impossible, but since the clan leader of the Vermillion Bird Clan has agreed to the matter of her participating as one of the Vermillion Bird\u2019s candidates, then there will indeed be a way.\u201dFor any average person, after reaching 16 years old, they\u2019d search for a magical beast that belonged to them, because only after reaching the age of 16, would a person\u2019s mental strength become stable. Furthermore, the signing of a contract with a magical beast was an extremely dangerous matter. If one\u2019s mental strength was too weak, one would be incapable of controlling the magical beast, and it was very likely that they\u2019d be the one to be devoured by the magical beast. Not only would one\u2019s mental strength suffer from serious damage, but it would probably be injured from the reverse devouring of the magical beast.According to Shen Yanxiao\u2019s age as of now, to be one of the Vermilion Bird Clan\u2019s candidates was somewhat too early.The people of the third generation of the Vermillion Bird Clan were stunned.When Shen Feng had given his commands yesterday, the people from the third generation simply weren\u2019t at the scene at all. Therefore, they simply didn\u2019t know that Shen Yanxiao would be added to the Vermillion Bird\u2019s candidate list. Originally, they\u2019d just thought that Shen Yanxiao\u2019s appearance today was somewhat strange. However, never had they thought that the reality would be so much more crazier that what they\u2019d thought of!Just what kind of a joke was this?! She was obviously an idiot, and nevertheless was trash\u2014yet this kind of person could unexpectedly become a candidate for the Vermillion Bird!!Among the people from the third generation, Shen Jiayi and Shen Jiawei\u2019s complexions, without a doubt, were the most unsightly, because they\u2019d just recently reached the suitable age. Only then could they become candidates for the Vermillion Bird. Why was it all about with this Shen Yanxiao? Not only was she stupid and a cripple, her age was also clearly short by two years. Had their grandfather gone utterly mad by unexpectedly allowing this disgrace to also partake?!Shen Jiayi\u2019s complexion distorted, as she didn\u2019t dare to believe in everything that she\u2019d heard of.This idiot had snatched her big brother Siyu, and now this idiot still wanted to snatch the Vermillion Bird? Just who did she think she was!Among the 3 candidates, Shen Yifeng was the most calm and collected without a doubt. Towards this one matter of Shen Yanxiao becoming a candidate for the Vermillion Bird, he didn\u2019t have that much resentment by far, when compared to Shen Jiayi.Even thinking while using one\u2019s toes, one would know that Shen Yanxiao would absolutely be unable to sign a contract with the Vermillion Bird. Leaving aside her lacking wisdom, with just that low and petty strength of hers, it would just be impossible for her to receive the Vermillion Bird\u2019s grace. It had to be known that, among the members of the successive generations that had signed the contract with the Vermillion Bird, all of them were the strongest existences in the Vermillion Bird Clan at their times.Liked it?

She\u2019d only serve as a prop regarding the Vermillion Bird, and he was already determined to win it. What\u2019s more was that although Shen Yanxiao was a trash, Shen Siyu\u2019s prospects were beyond measure. If he could use the reason of treating that idiot properly, then pulling Shen Siyu into a closer relationship between them, would only take half the work and would have twice the effect for him towards becoming the heir of the Vermillion Bird Clan.Therefore no matter what happened, Shen Yifeng wouldn\u2019t criticise this matter of Shen Yanxiao becoming the Vermillion Bird\u2019s candidate at all. So much so that, from this period of time onwards, he would properly display his concern and care towards Shen Yanxiao in order to obtain Shen Siyu\u2019s kindness.During the time where everyone was gnashing their teeth because of this matter concerning Shen Yanxiao becoming the Vermillion Bird\u2019s candidate, Shen Yanxiao, being the person involved, was nevertheless flabbergasted.Just what \u2018song\u2019 were you guys singing at? Since when did she deserve to unexpectedly also be dragged into this muddy water?Shen Yanxiao was speechless. Although she too wanted to have this extremely valiant Vermillion Bird based on the rumour, swindled to her hands, she was very clear that with her position in the Vermillion Bird Clan right now, meeting the Vermillion Bird was even harder than meeting with the monarch. However, in this world, there were still these kind of unexpected things where Shen Feng had unexpectedly had her entered as the Vermillion Bird\u2019s candidate\u2026Had Shen Feng\u2019s head been damaged?No matter how discontent everyone from the Vermillion Bird Clan was, all of them were very clear that, so long as it was a matter that Shen Feng had decided on, there just wouldn\u2019t be any leeway towards turning around. Even if there were more ideas for them to complain about their discontent, it could only be suppressed in their hearts.The time left until they headed for the lava valley was 3 days. The likes of people such as Shen Yue, were originally extremely angry towards the matter of Shen Yanxiao popping up, but Shen Yue had very quickly came to realise that even if Shen Yanxiao was given the qualifications, so what? With that idiot\u2019s strength, if she could sign a contract with the Vermilion Bird, then wouldn\u2019t it be such that everyone in the world would be able to sign a contract with a mythological beast?After figuring it out, Shen Yue very quickly pacified Shen Jiayi and Shen Jiawei. Only after these two brats listened to their father\u2019s analysis, were they a little bit happier. Thinking about it again, Shen Feng having Shen Yanxiao dragged out wasn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. One had to know that Shen Jiayi and Shen Jiawei\u2019s personal strengths weren\u2019t bad, but in front of this formidable opponent, Shen Yifeng, they too would only be floating clouds.If there were only 3 of them fighting over the Vermillion Bird, it was very probable that, under the powerful Shen Yifeng, the two of them would suffer a crushing defeat. When the time came and it happened before the sage, wouldn\u2019t that just be them throwing their clan\u2019s face away to the greatest extent. As of now, there was this person, Shen Yanxiao, who was able to be the worst among them all. Even if they couldn\u2019t compare to Shen Yifeng, they could absolutely crush Shen Yanxiao. Having Shen Yanxiao, this trash and idiot, to serve as a prop, would allow them to still at least retrieve some face back in front of the sage.Thinking about it this way, how would Shen Jiayi and Shen Jiawei still grumble about Shen Feng\u2019s sudden move of squeezing in that trash, for in their mind, they\u2019d long become deeply grateful for their grandfather\u2019s \u2018sensible act\u2019!Shen Jiayi and Shen Jiawei, these two brats, were secretly complacent, while Shen Yifeng clearly didn\u2019t mind this time\u2019s unexpected event.Because in regards to the three of them, Shen Yanxiao\u2019s was precisely for the purpose of supporting their outstandingness; there\u2019d only be prominence if there was contrast!As for that Shen Yanxiao whom everyone had believed to be used as the \u2018base cushion\u2019, she was single-handedly supporting her chin at this moment, and was sitting on a chair and was somewhat at a loss. [TLN: Base cushion means the weakest or ranked the last]\u201cJust what is Shen Feng thinking of, to have me placed before the Vermillion Bird? Even if I could \u2018save\u2019 the face of these two brats before the sage once, no matter how it\u2019s said, I\u2019m still a person of the Vermillion Bird Clan. I don\u2019t think a single bit that having an idiot to lose face would be slightly better looking than having these two brats here to lose face.\u201dLiked it?

However, even if she were to go, with the image that she had in front of the people, she had neither the intelligence nor the the strength to even throw them out. Compared to those two brats, it\u2019d be even worse.Therefore, from the beginning Shen Yanxiao didn\u2019t think that the purpose of Shen Feng having her push out would be as simple as it seemed.\u2018No matter what the reason is, it\u2019s an opportunity for you. There\u2019s no need for you to be tangled with the root cause.\u2019 Xiu\u2019s voice was still as ice-cold as before, like snow. The way it seemed to him, was that there wasn\u2019t any need to consider this kind of thing at all. No matter what Shen Feng\u2019s goals were, as long as Shen Yanxiao had the opportunity to stand before the Vermillion Bird, it would be a golden opportunity bestowed by the heavens with regards to her.Shen Yanxiao\u2019s mouth twitched because Xiu\u2019s bearing was as if the Vermillion Bird was still a thing that was within her purse. However, she herself didn\u2019t have confidence towards this matter.Just how long had she been in this world? Even the concept of regular magical beasts wasn\u2019t completely clear. What\u2019s more, it was a mythological animal that stood at the peak of the magical beast\u2019s food chain.\u201cOnly after being certain about this opportunity, will it be okay. Haven\u2019t you heard what they\u2019ve said? The Vermilion Bird has already been lying dormant for hundreds of years, and talented people from the Vermillion Bird Clan have came forth in large numbers\u2014yet no one was able to obtain its good graces. Just with that tiny physique of mine as of now\u2026\u201d Self-confidence was one thing, but ignorance combined with self-confidence would only bring about one\u2019s death. Although Shen Yanxiao was very confident towards herself, she was very prudent the entire time when she confronted the unknown.This had been her habit until now, and it had allowed her to repeatedly succeed, and she wasn\u2019t arrested by anyone. As a godly thief, it was one thing to have valiant skill, but it was also an essential thing to do assignments before making a move.In regards to herself, the Vermillion Bird was just like a unique, 100 carat diamond. However, as of now, this diamond had been deposited in a dangerous place that she actually hadn\u2019t even heard of.There were a lot of good things, but it would only be a genuinely good thing when it was certain that one could get ahold of it.\u2018It was merely a little bird.\u2019 Xiu coldly snorted as he said, for he disapproved of Shen Yanxiao\u2019s prudentness.Here we go again\u2026Towards this certain great master, who had a rank 8 magical beast called as a \u2018very small domestic animal\u2019, and had a mythological animal called as a \u2018little bird\u2019\u2026 this should be considered to be a certain type of acknowledgement, right?Shen Yanxiao dumbfoundedly gazed at the firmament. However, Xiu\u2019s words gave rise to a certain feeling in her heart. Hesitatingly, she said, \u201cListening to the tone of your voice\u2026are you possibly acquainted with the Vermillion Bird?\u201dXiu\u2019s voice completely lacked undulations as it carried on the same kind of aloof and remote tone as he spoke, \u201cIt still doesn\u2019t deserve my recognition, I only remember its owner, that\u2019s all.\u201dShen Yanxiao\u2019s eyes shone!With regards to Xiu, her identity had been brimming with mystery all along. From the understanding that she had from the period of time with this great master, and according to Xiu\u2019s haughty temper, since he\u2019d said that he had recognised the master of the Vermillion Bird, then it would certainly be true that he had indeed recognised the master of the Vermillion Bird!Thinking about it\u2026Just how old was this person? It\u2019d already been a century since the Vermillion Bird had appeared in this world. Since Xiu had recognised the master of the Vermillion Bird, then it would certainly have been a matter that had occurred a century ago.A century ago, Xiu was already born. Then, wouldn\u2019t that make it so that his age as of now had already passed a hundred years old?!Shen Yanxiao really didn\u2019t want to believe that this rather conspicuous, cold, and young male voice would unexpectedly be sent out by an \u2018old man\u2019 whose age was more than a century!

What does the Vermillion Bird look like, and is there any particular request needed to sign a contract with it?\u201d Even if it was Shen Feng who was the current clan head of the Vermillion Bird Clan, the Vermillion Bird was only known by name. He\u2019d never seen it in person. Yet, this guy who was inside of her body, had actually met the Vermillion Bird before, and so much so that it was very probable that he was extremely familiar with the former master of the Vermillion Bird. Having a person like this who was extremely \u2018familiar\u2019 with the Vermillion Bird at that time, caused Shen Yanxiao\u2019s mind to more or less begin to get the idea of obtaining the mythological animal.However, that was a mythological animal!Despite how much an understanding she lacked regarding the magical beast, just thinking of the words, \u2018Obtain the Vermillion Bird and become the clan head\u2019 was sufficient to have her appetite wide open.\u2018It\u2019s nothing more than an arrogant little bird who overestimates its capabilities, and is slightly bigger compared to ordinary magical beast of the flying bird species. That\u2019s it.\u2019 Xiu said.If she could, Shen Yanxiao would\u2019ve pried open Xiu\u2019s head in order to have a proper look regarding information about the Vermillion Bird. Just what kind of information was all of this\u2014what was the difference between having said all of these things, and having said none?The great master Xiu seemed to have the intent of not speaking much more. Despite Shen Yanxiao making threats and promises, Xiu still didn\u2019t proceed with the topic again. Instead, Xiu urged Shen Yanxiao to rapidly enter cultivation mode. Although in his eyes the Vermillion Bird was nothing more than an arrogant little bird, with regards to the strength of this little bird, it would only be okay for Shen Yanxiao to have this little bird nodding its head and paying its allegiance to her, if either her Dou Qi or her magic was promoted to at least rank 6.Having not received any useful information, and still lashed at by Xiu to bitterly cultivate, Shen Yanxiao could only restrain her own inquisitiveness, and comply by executing his words.However, in her mind, she nevertheless had her own \u2018little abacus\u2019.If you have the ability, you can continue on with being tight-lipped. I just can\u2019t believe, at that time, that you\u2019d be willing to stare blankly and watch the Vermillion Bird throw itself into somebody else\u2019s arms!Like locusts tied to a rope, would the likes of her be afraid of a basket?! [TLN:They are in the same boat so the MC isn\u2019t worried]\u2026\u2026The period of 5 days went by just like that, and the present, first thing in the morning, a few luxurious carriage had been parked at the entrance of the Vermillion Bird Clan.The sage had long been seated inside his own carriage. Through the window of the carriage, the sage signalled Shen Feng by nodding his head.With the candidates of the Vermillion Bird headed by Shen Yifeng, he respectfully stood before Shen Feng and listened to Shen Feng\u2019s briefing one last time before they travelled afar.\u201cThis delegation relates to the reputation of the Vermillion Bird Clan. No matter what the price that has to be paid, among the 4 of you, it has to be one of you that brings the Vermillion Bird back.\u201d Shen Feng dignifiedly looked at his 4 grandchildren. It\u2019d be a long journey this time. Therefore, the troops of the God\u2019s Domain had attached most importance where apart from the 4 candidates of the Vermillion Bird Clan, a retinue was send to each of them to be placed beside them.Among the 4 of them, Shen Yifeng\u2019s odds of seizing it was the highest. Not only had he inherited the the most outstanding lineage of the Vermillion Bird Clan. but he was also the rarest genius the Vermillion Bird Clan had seen in the past hundred years. Therefore, everyone from the Vermillion Bird Clan had an enormous amount of expectations for Shen Yifeng.Shen Jiayi and Shen Jiawei\u2019s strength were one chip less, but their gifts were still pretty good. Merely, under the suppression of Shen Yifeng, their prominent ability and sagacity had become mediocre.It had been centuries since the Vermillion Bird had appeared, so no one knew what the requirements were for the Vermillion Bird to choose its owner. If the selection wasn\u2019t according to strength, then it\u2019d still be highly probable for the two of them to receive the good graces of the Vermillion Bird.After all, the twin\u2019s mental strengths were a kind of extremely subtle existence. If the two of them had had the intention of having their mental strength achieve the stage where their mental strength complimented each other\u2019s, then, solely based on their mental strength, they would\u2019ve been able to share the same limelight with Shen Yifeng.That satisfaction that was hidden deep within the eyes gave rise to a trace of variation when the eyes fell onto that thin and weak body.Liked it?

A disorganized look could be seen in her eyes, and it looked as if she was lost in her own world. She simply wasn\u2019t even listening to what Shen Feng had said, and among her 5 sensory organs\u2019, that pair of delicate and glittering eyes of hers were simply wandering around, and weren\u2019t fixed to the left or right in the least. From her body, one simply couldn\u2019t see the her prudence towards this long journey, and it just looked like a confused and ignorant child that was being firmly dragged along within the army of troops.This kind of Shen Yanxiao had created an extremely intense contrast as she stood beside the three of them.This scene of three pretty and handsome youngsters who were in glowing spirits, that at their side, had this unprepossessed and muddleheaded \u2018ugly duckling\u2019 truly had people feeling that it was pretty funny.Today, Shen Jiayi had intentionally only come out after applying make up. She then deliberately stood beside Shen Yanxiao. After already doing a meticulous make on Shen Jiayi\u2019s pretty complexion, and under the support of Shen Yanxiao\u2019s mediocre look, Shen Jiayi appeared to be more and more distinctly beautiful.When the two of them stood side by side, the difference between them was like Heaven and Earth.The complacent smile on the corner of Shen Jiayi\u2019s mouth began to spread, because within this generation of the Vermillion Bird Clan, she and Shen Yanxiao were the only females. Therefore, without a doubt, Shen Yanxiao\u2019s ugliness had supported Shen Jiayi\u2019s beauty.Even if Shen Jiayi was unable to contest for the Vermillion Bird, she still wanted to have this idiot properly eat a meal of suffering along the journey\u2014she wanted to have Shen Yanxiao lose face before the sage, and have her proper revenge on Shen Yanxiao for the humiliation that she\u2019d previously received!\u201cYes.\u201d The three of them respectfully answered.This time, not only did it relate to whether the Vermillion Bird Clan could return to the peak, but it even more related to their future positions in the Vermilion Bird Clan. No matter who they were, no one would give up this kind of opportunity!\u2026 \u2026The terrain of the lava valley was precisely like its name. It was located between the few high mountains, and there were ash-gray rocks everywhere that were leftover from being burnt. It was obviously a cool and refreshing autumn, but within the lava ravine, it was nevertheless incomparably hot. The heatwave that emerged prominently, was surging from the terrain. As far as the eye could see, within the entire valley, there wasn\u2019t any vegetation. Distantly looking at it, it was like a route made of pitch black\u2014a rift valley that had split open within the green forest.There wasn\u2019t even a single household that dwelled in the vicinity of the lava valley, because everyone from the Long Xuan Empire knew that near the lava valley, not even mentioning humans, even the jackals that were the least picky towards their habitats wouldn\u2019t be willing to settle here. In this desolate place that also had torrid heat, only demonic beasts that were capable of making the people\u2019s blood run cold would hide themselves within the rubble as they struggled on the verge of death.Previously, the lava valley hadn\u2019t existed at all. It had also been covered with a slice of green jade colour. However, after the Vermillion Bird had decided to settle here, all of the life had been burnt away by the blaze of the Vermillion Bird, leaving practically nothing behind. The vitality on this piece of soil had thoroughly faded away.Apart from the Vermillion Bird Clan, where the clan would send their people every generation to check up on the circumstances of the Vermillion Bird that was lying dormant, there simply wasn\u2019t anyone that would willingly visit this piece of dead land.Even if it was the people of the Vermillion Bird Clan that had previously come by, every examination of theirs would definitely bring about an enormous loss. The high temperature of the lava valley had the people who had yet to reach rank 6 couldn\u2019t stay here for a long time. Concealed within the darkness, were demonic beasts that were waiting for an opportunity to make their move. Therefore, every examination would often have a batch of people that died in the mouths of those savage demonic beast. However, even if it was like this, the Vermillion Bird Clan was still unwilling to give up this piece of \u2018holy land\u2019.Seven to eight luxurious carriages unhurriedly entered into this piece of quiet valley. The carriage that was taking the lead clearly wanted to be distanced from the rear carriages. Speaking of it, it was also strange, because this place plainly had such a torrid heat, but around these few carriages there was a slight trace of a chill that was nevertheless emitted, as if they completely hadn\u2019t felt the invasion and harassment of the high temperature.Liked it?

    "Chapter 44": "Chapter 44 - The Lava Valley Part 2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euSince this time\u2019s entrance into the valley held significant importance, Shen Feng had already made all of the proper preparations by the time they set off. These few carriages had all used Ice-Cold Black Metal in order to forge their main poles. Even if they were to be in the most sizzling, hot places, the people within the carriages wouldn\u2019t sense a even a smidgen of the torrid heat.The construction cost of just this batch of carriages would be sufficient enough to buy out a city. Even if it was the richly provided Vermillion Bird Clan, the clan could only build 10 of these.Yet this time alone, it\u2019d used 8 of them at once.Apart from that Ice-Cold Black Metal that supported carriages that prevented sunstroke, everyone that was proceeding towards the lava valley this time had put on Ice Silk Armour that resisted heat. This was because the nearer they were to the location where the Vermillion Bird lay dormant, the higher the heat they\u2019d actually suffer from. If the Ice Silk Armour wasn\u2019t there to act as protection, it\u2019d be very likely that they\u2019d be roasted till they were dry by the high temperature, when they\u2019d only just tread into the place where the Vermillion Bird lay dormant.Speaking according to the reasoning that entering an environment that was vile like this and that was a place where dangers lurked on every side, there was no way that Shen Feng would only send 4 retinues to follow them\u2014all of this was the sage\u2019s idea.In regards to the foreigners, everything about the God\u2019s Domain was enigmatic. The sage\u2019s capability to rouse the mythological animal was even more of a secret amongst the God\u2019s Domain. If it wasn\u2019t for the anxiousness that these four young masters and young ladies, which had lived like princes and princesses, would find due to the unbearably long and difficult journey, it was very likely that the people from the God\u2019s Domain wouldn\u2019t even be willing to have these 4 retinues taken along with them.As for its safety\u2026The God\u2019s Domain was a very formidable existence, and during this journey, there were as many as eighteen God\u2019s Envoys of the God\u2019s Domain. What\u2019s more, was that the person that was still sitting to the front of the carriages was the God\u2019s Domain\u2019s strongest existence\u2014the sage.Even if it was a high level demonic beast that wanted to strike this group of people, it was very likely that it\u2019d have to ponder about it.When surveying the entire Guang Mang Continent, it would also only be the God\u2019s Domain that would dare to pat their chest and say that there wasn\u2019t even a single strand of demonic beast\u2019s hair that could be seen on their territory.It had to be known that, the higher rank the demonic beast was, the higher its wisdom was. Not only did a high level demonic beast have tyrannical strength, but it was also as witty as the human race. It absolutely wouldn\u2019t go and attack this kind of troop, that was overseen by an apex expert, and had its life endangered.Within this carriage itself, the smell of the human race floated out, and when the carriage had just entered the lava valley, it drew out a great amount of inferior demonic beast right away. Although the demonic beasts\u2019 intelligence was very low, they could still distantly feel a formidable oppression that was emitted from the first carriage. Despite how fragrant and sweet the smell was that belonged to the human race, their fears that came from their instincts nevertheless told them that the people within the carriages absolutely couldn\u2019t satisfy their desire for good food.The demonic beasts had starved for ages, but no matter how gluttonous they were, they too could only distantly hide within the dark, and sniff at that fragrant and sweet smell that they hadn\u2019t smelt of for a long time in order to slightly console themselves.Counting from the back, the carriage that Shen Yanxiao was currently sitting on was the second within the troop. Although the God\u2019s Envoys from the God\u2019s Domain were haughty, they too knew the severity the head and tail of the carriages held, and they were all left to them to be in charge of, in order to prevent some demonic beasts that hadn\u2019t opened their eyes and had rashly attacked.\u201cTch, the scene here is indeed even more wretched, and is similar to it having been bombarded by a nuclear warhead.\u201d Through the window\u2019s tulle in the carriage, Shen Yanxiao observed the outside circumstances. [TLN: Tch is the sound of clicking a tongue]Amongst all of the carriages, there was only her herself that\u2019d had her retinue, which had been assigned to her right away, \u2018borrowed\u2019 by Shen Jiayi under the reason of \u2018not having enough manpower\u2019 on the second day when they were setting off. As for the horses that were pulling the Ice-Cold Black Metal carriages, they were all military horses that were resistant to cold, and had been selected by a specialist. They\u2019d automatically follow the leading horse\u2019s advances. and therefore, simply didn\u2019t need to have any people to drive it.In other words, no matter what Shen Yanxiao was doing right now inside the carriage, and so long as she didn\u2019t get out of the carriage, there wouldn\u2019t be anyone that\u2019d her discover, even if she were to do a somersault inside the carriage. Naturally, there wasn\u2019t a need to take note of whether her own words and actions would cause amazement to the other people or not.Liked it?

Didn\u2019t you say that it wasn\u2019t much bit bigger compared to ordinary birds? Why go so far as to reside in such a big den?\u201d Shen Yanxiao raised her eyebrows. It\u2019d already been half a day since they\u2019d entered the lava valley, but looking at the route ahead, it was very likely that there was still a greater part of the distance left from their current location to their destination.\u2018The four mythical animals\u2019 tempers are all very arrogant. Therefore, within the vicinity of the dens that they reside at, they absolutely won\u2019t allow the existence of any other living thing. The Vermillion Bird is fire-based, thus it prefers places with torrid heat. Only by having the temperature of the den\u2019s surroundings raised to their limits, will it think that the place is fitting to be resided in. Although the Vermillion Bird soars through the sky most of the time, its desire to exercise control with regards to the surface is, nevertheless, extremely strong. The den here, compared to its previous, is already very narrow. It seems that before it laid down and became dormant, it received some kind of serious damage. Or else, those few mountains to the sides wouldn\u2019t have existed either.\u2019 Xiu\u2019s tone was very, very unperturbed, and it was as if Xiu was only talking about how the day\u2019s weather was. He didn\u2019t think in the slightest bit\u2014what was the reason to be making a fuss about nothing, and occupying that kind of vast-streched territory. So much so that he felt as if the den that the Vermillion Bird had selected this time around was awfully poverty-stricken.Xiu was very unperturbed, however, Shen Yanxiao wasn\u2019t unperturbed.Being a modern person who\u2019d sincerely experienced the lifelong struggle for tens of square meters of humble abode, the explanation for this piece of the lava valley had her stunned incessantly.Such extravagance! It was indeed, truly extravagant!What kind of extravagance was this? In order to find a place to sleep, they\u2019d just invade and occupy a region that was comparable to a small city of the modern era. When compared to the Vermillion Bird\u2019s lava valley, those people from her previous life who\u2018d considered themselves to be self-important when they bought islands, were simply too pathetic!From what Shen Yanxiao had heard, Xiu\u2019s opinion clearly stated that the previous place in which the Vermillion Bird had resided was much bigger compared to here. In regards to being a mythological animal, the current place that the Vermillion Bird was residing in was like a basement\u2014simple, crude, and narrow.She didn\u2019t dare to imagine how wide the the Vermillion Bird\u2019s \u2018formal\u2019 place of residency would be\u2026Moreover, according to Xiu\u2019s opinion, it seemed like, apart from the Vermillion Bird, the other few mythological animals\u2019 residential locations also had huge discrepancies.After all, the Guangmang Continent was very vast. It was capable of squeezing in this many humans and beasts at the same time, yet was still able to have these much larger areas of lands, for these mythological animals, as an extravagant expense.\u201cXiu, were the places that you previously resided in also quite huge?\u201d Shen Yanxiao knew that, a long long time ago, Xiu had had his own body. Although she didn\u2019t know why he\u2019d become a spirit that had stayed within her body, she was extremely curious. After all, what kind of a place was it, to be able to raise this kind temperament in a great master?Xiu didn\u2019t immediately reply, and it was as if he was recalling something. Only after a moment, did he unhurriedly reply.\u2018En.\u2019Was it possible for him to not give her such a succinct reply?!Not accepting it as correct, Shen Yanxiao continued to ask.\u201cWas it bigger than the lava valley?\u201d\u2018En.\u2019Liked it?

There\u2019s no time for you to rest.\u2019Shen Yanxiao\u2019s face darkened\u2026Although her promotions during this period of time were still regarded as being steady, there was still a certain amount of distance between her current level and Xiu\u2019s order of her reaching rank 6!!This action of his was truly forcing her to her death!\u2026 \u2026Under Xiu\u2019s shocking teaching, Shen Yanxiao carried out Xiu\u2019s challenging order which was that, so long as the objective wasn\u2019t reached, there wouldn\u2019t be any rest during the following time along the journey!To be precise, she cultivated inside the carriage for the entire 2 days and 2 nights!It had to be known that it\u2019d already been two and a half days since they\u2019d first entered the lava valley, and they still unexpectedly hadn\u2019t reached the Vermillion Bird\u2019s den. This reality truly had people vomiting blood!This was an entire 2 days and 2 nights! Even her eyelids hadn\u2019t closed at all. If there was even a trace of her slacking, Xiu\u2019s cold voice of, like ice shards, would omnipresently explode inside her mind. This wasn\u2019t a sound that the ear could hear. Even if she\u2019d her ears stabbed until she was deaf, that voice that could drive people mad wouldn\u2019t have decreased by even a tiny bit.Everyday, the god\u2019s envoys would always dispatch people to give food and drink to the people in every carriages. The rest of the time, they\u2019d hasten on with their journey. After having been in the lava valley for such a long time, Shen Yanxiao\u2019s pair of legs hadn\u2019t even gotten close to the ground.Finally, under Xiu\u2019s inhuman ravage, the magic within Shen Yanxiao\u2019s body broke through to rank 6 before the sunset of the day!After rank 6, Shen Yanxiao had to choose amongst the 3 occupations in order to have her own path of magic cultivation, which were magician, warlock, or priest.Xiu was a very good teacher, for he\u2019d made a simple and clear-cut analysis for Shen Yanxiao regarding the circumstances of these 3 directions.Magicians were the strongest amongst the 3 of them in their attacking property. Even if they were within a huge troop, they\u2019d still play a critical role, for their formidable magic attacks would often give rise to even more frightening killing power when compared to siege weapons. On top of that, magicians had an extremely long distance range of attack, and could be said to everyone\u2019s nightmare.However, magicians were also very frail. Under a circumstance where the magicians had an absolute distance from their enemies, they were unrivalled existences. However, if they were attacked by a formidable opponent that was near to them, they\u2019d become extremely frail.Liked it?

The more formidable the magic was, the longer the chanting time was. Without an absolutely safe surrounding, they simply had no way to concentrate their spirit on chanting their magic. Therefore, a magician was definitely an extreme profession.A king in long distance, but a feeble one in close quarters.This direction was the first that one that Shen Yanxiao gave up on.When facing danger, any type of enemy wouldn\u2019t give a magician the time to chant at all. Without a formidable team as a protection, it was very likely that an unaccompanied magician would be mistreated and killed by a low level close quarter profession. Certainly, a top-notch magician would have an extreme chanting time, but would also be experienced, and could absolutely have those enemies that fought in close quarters oppressed to death.However, this wasn\u2019t the result that Shen Yanxiao wanted. She didn\u2019t have anyone to depend on, and under these circumstances, she\u2019d have to suffer losses from close quarters during the early stages. Therefore, she had very little interest regarding becoming a magician.Moreover, it was a habit of hers to make moves in between the winks. Chanting, this kind of thing that was time-consuming and required a great deal of effort, didn\u2019t suit her.The second one, was the priest. A priest had weak attack properties, low enough to almost be said as none. However, they had an extremely strong capability towards connecting with nature. By drawing support from the power of the nature, they could cure any injuries. Moreover, they could also use the power of the nature that they were good at to strengthen the body and power of themselves, and the people who were beside them. Certainly, all of these things were short term duration effects.In fact, a priest was an existence that was even more dependant on companions compared to a magician. Without a formidable companion to depend on, a priest alone couldn\u2019t even deal with an inferior demonic beast.The priests of this world had a little bit of resemblance to the doctors of the modern era. It was just that a priest was much more mysterious and omnipotent, when compared to a doctor.Before Shen Yanxiao had finished listening, she immediately vetoed this kind of a path that was filled with the hint of the Holy Mother.She didn\u2019t want to be standing behind someone\u2019s back and be the parasite that enjoyed the protection of others!Finally, there was only the Warlock left.Compared to when Xiu had mentioned the magician and the priest, his narration about the Warlock was very subtle, and even more detailed.Warlocks were a previous existence of the Guangming Continent that were very intriguing. Their properties of long range attacks weren\u2019t as valiant compared to magicians, and they didn\u2019t have any capabilities in curing wounds, but it was indeed a nightmare to an awfully large amount of people.Warlocks possessed weird cursing techniques. They couldn\u2019t cause people to scatter into ashes and disperse into smoke in only the time it took to blink,however, under a secret influence, it could have the dead\u2019s skeleton not exist. It was just like a kind of unseeable poison that was clearly unable to be understood. Under the situation that no one was aware of, it\u2019d corrode the enemy\u2019s life away. The cursing techniques didn\u2019t need incantations. They just needed the knot of the finger marked. In the time it took to blink, warlocks could give out cursing techniques that could cause the enemy to become poor in health. So much so that, it could cause a formidable magician to become incapable of utilizing any magic power and turn into trash that was waiting to be slaughtered within a short period of time.It could be said to be the first choice of a vile person!Just as Xiu had finished speaking, Shen Yanxiao began to generate an enormous amount of interest right away towards this profession that had other people feeling their blood running cold.As a godly thief, it wasn\u2019t her inherent qualities to have her own body revealed before people, and then charging and breaking through enemy lines. Concealing herself within the dark corners and waiting for an opportunity before making a move was exactly what she took pleasure in!A warlock was practically precisely tailored for her!\u201cIt shall be this then!\u201d At once, Shen Yanxiao had decided that she wanted to walk on the path of a warlock, that was so much broader and open.However, Xiu nevertheless reminded her that within the entirety of the Guangming Continent, the people who\u2019d studied as warlocks were simply not many. This was because, in the eyes of the majority of people, a warlock was an extremely dark existence. Moreover, the way it did things was despicable. Any large clans wouldn\u2019t allow one\u2019s own clan member to study this profession that disgraced their dignity, for a genuinely strong person must welcome their enemies directly!Liked it?

A warlock was a path that was closest to the dark amongst the six possible directions of dou qi and magic, and the God\u2019s Domain of the Guangming Continent boycotted every sinister power that approached the darkness.Due to the commoner\u2019s prejudice and the God\u2019s Domain\u2019s pressure, one practically couldn\u2019t find anybody that studied as a warlock within the entire Guangming Continent.Even if there was someone, that person would go through his days as the target of scorn\u2014yelled at and beaten by everyone.Shen Yanxiao couldn\u2019t understand why an incisive profession like this had become a detestable existence after reaching the mouths of these hypocrites.Despicable? In this world, there were many dignified people in this word, who on the surface appeared bright and clean, but in private were no strangers to doing dirty things.The commoners were able to accept those dignified hypocrites, and yet they were unwilling to accept a certain profession of magic?This ridiculousness truly had Shen Yanxiao at the point of not knowing whether to laugh or cry.\u201cWhat\u2019s the use of boycotting it anyways? So what if you don\u2019t like it? There\u2019s no need for the people to point out the path that I\u2019ve picked for myself.\u201d Shen Yanxiao sneered, for she\u2019d never been one that\u2019d cared about the secular way of looking at things.She\u2019d only pick what she herself decided to be correct, and wouldn\u2019t blindly comply with the secular point of view.Shen Yanxiao was very clear that in this world, one had to rely on one\u2019s self, for there wasn\u2019t anyone that could be relied on.\u2018Remember what you\u2019ve said today, for only you yourself can hold fast to your own selection.\u2019 Regarding Shen Yanxiao\u2019s perseverance, Xiu didn\u2019t speak any more in dissuading her. So much that, Shen Yanxiao faintly felt that Xiu was very pleased with her selection.Although the future direction of her magic had already been made certain, it was practically impossible to want to learn things about warlocks at this kind of simple and crude place. Even if Xiu were to be even more enigmatic, hundreds of year ago, he too couldn\u2019t have foreseen that the person that he\u2019d stay in would take the path of a warlock, and naturally wouldn\u2019t install the studying material pertaining to a warlock into his mind.Moreover, the second layer of the Seven Stars Locking Moon seal had yet to be undone. After Shen Yanxiao had entered rank 6, the growth of her magic had right away plateaued. No matter how calm her mind was in cultivating, it hadn\u2019t grown even a tiny bit.Just as Xiu had said, the time where it was still sealed was tightly and intimately related with the effects that\u2019d be brought about from undoing the seal.Shen Yanxiao could only dispel her thoughts and continue cultivating on the path of a warlock at the moment, and could only begin majoring in Dou Qi.Unfortunately, breaking through to rank 6 in such a short time was already an extremely rarely seen circumstances. Wanting to have the same breakthrough again for her Dou Qi within an extremely brief period\u2026 would indeed be the ravings of a lunatic!Xiu too was no longer like before, where he\u2019d urged Shen Yanxiao to cultivate.As the carriages of the Vermillion Bird Clan advanced towards the depths of the lava valley, the temperature all around them had become hotter and hotter. If a water drop fell onto the surface, it\u2019d be evaporated into gas in a single moment. Even low-level demonic beasts wouldn\u2019t dare to enter this kind of blazing region.As for the people within the carriage, they too knew that, along with the ascending temperature, they\u2019d also be getting nearer and nearer to the den that the Vermillion Bird was dwelling within.\u2026 \u2026Shen Jiayi and Shen Jiawei sat in the same carriage. Within that carriage, there was only one middle-aged retinue left behind to serve the both of them as they rest. As for the other two retinues, both of them had remained in the carriage that Shen Jiawei originally should\u2019ve ridden in.\u201cJust how much longer till we get there? Sitting inside this carriage all day long, I\u2019m exhausted from head to foot! I\u2019m sick of eating beef jerky! If I continue to eat it, I won\u2019t be able to help wanting to throw up!\u201d Shen Jiayi wrinkled her brows as she sit inside the carriage. All along, she\u2019d gotten accustomed to living like a princess in the Vermillion Bird Clan. These few days of hastening along on their journey had her feeling unwell all over. If it wasn\u2019t that it was related to the Vermillion Bird, and also because she had the opportunity to win a favourable impression before the sage, she simply wouldn\u2019t have been willing to endure this kind of hardship.Liked it?

[TLN: The \u2018peh\u2019 at the beginning is the sound of expelling breath]\u201cIt can be precisely said that she\u2019s an idiot, when she already has an issue wearing her clothes and eating her meals by herself.

Sister, you nevertheless are awesome, to have her retinue brought over to you a long time ago.\u201d Shen Jiawei chuckled as he said.\u201cAs for her, does she deserve our clan\u2019s elite\u2019s services?

As a matter of fact, I want to see how comfortable she is without anyone attending to her and yet being shut inside her carriage.\u201d Shen Jiayi was very clear that she couldn\u2019t be too obvious at making things hard on Shen Yanxiao before the sage. However, she could naturally make some small movements behind the sage\u2019s back. Although it couldn\u2019t loosen the hatred in her mind, it could still make Shen Yanxiao suffer some pain.The two sibling working hand in hand with each other. As for the retinue, who was to the side keeping watch and serving them, the retinue had turned a blind eye to the matter of the two bullying Shen Yanxiao. The retinue only carefully observed the circumstances that were outside the window.Suddenly, a vague human reflection flashed past outside of the carriage\u2019s window. Astonished, the retinue extended the head outside, and nevertheless discovered that there wasn\u2019t even a shadow on the scorched soil outside.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Shen Jiayi asked, as she\u2019d taken note of the fact that the retinue was acting strangely.The retinue looked and looked, but truly didn\u2019t discover any anomalies afterwards. Only then did the retinue sit back at their original seat and say, \u201cThis subordinate had a vague and unclear vision just now, for a moment, and it was as if there was someone outside.\u201dShen Jiayi laughed heartily and said, \u201cCould it be that you\u2019re getting blurry vision due to the jolting of the carriage? How could it be possible that there was someone outside? According to what my father\u2019s said, inside the region that we\u2019re in now, if one doesn\u2019t wear the Ice Silk Armour and is to walk at the outside, one will immediately become human jerky. In this kind of place, how could there be people?\u201dThe retinue nodded, for he too felt that his eyesight had dimmed, and thus didn\u2019t take it to heart.On the eve of the third day, the eight carriages had stopped in front of an enormous cave.After rushing along the journey for a long time, they\u2019d finally reached their destination. Everyone who\u2019d been jolted inside the carriage for a long time impatiently got out of their carriages.Shen Jiayi still knew the potential severity of her actions, and sent back the retinue that was originally in charge of taking care of Shen Yanxiao.After being lead down off the carriage by the retinue, Shen Yanxiao extended her posture for a moment, before lifting her head and looking at the colossus that was before her eyes.The pitch-black cave had a sufficient dimension that was half the size of a small mountain. Just by standing in the cave mouth, she was able to immediately sense the unending stream of high temperature that was coming from the cave itself. Fortunately, the Ice Silk Armour on her body helped to resist the invasion of the blazing heat. Although she could still sense the temperature that would\u2019ve normally roasted people, it wasn\u2019t really too intolerable.\u201cThis way, please.\u201d Said the retinue that stood at Shen Yanxiao\u2019s side. Although the retinue knew that this seventh young lady would be unable to make sense of his words, he couldn\u2019t help but to be a little respectful towards Shen Yanxiao before the sage.Liked it?

To be able to be added into the troop this time was sufficient to testify his strength. However, he hadn\u2019t expected that he\u2019d unexpectedly be sent to attend to a piece of trash like this, and was very unwilling in his heart. Therefore, when Shen Jiayi showed up and deliberately made things difficult for Shen Yanxiao, he simply didn\u2019t hesitate the slightest bit. He directly moved towards Shen Jiayi, and had Shen Yanxiao thrown into the carriage alone for 3 days.Shen Yanxiao knew the inner thoughts of some people, and was disinclined to give them extra attention. She walked to the cave mouth.People such as Shen Jiayi had arrived at the cave mouth long ago. There was a constant heat wave within the pitch-black cave that constantly rushed forth and surging in and out, which had people not willing or daring to take half a step nearer.\u201cThis is precisely the place that the Vermillion Bird is laying dormant. You all should go and do some preparations, for we\u2019ll be going in there in a little while.\u201d The pure and holy smile was still hanging on the sage\u2019s face, and there wasn\u2019t even a little bit of nervousness towards confronting the cave before his eyes.Shen Yifeng\u2019s heartbeat became more and more rapid, for after the Vermillion Bird\u2019s rousing this time, he\u2019d most likely be the candidate that\u2019d inherit the Vermillion Bird. He was already almost certain that the mythological animal that was lying dormant here was nearly under his usage. In order to conceal his current state of mind, which was more and more excited, he turned and looked at Shen Yanxiao, who\u2019d already arrived at his side.He was very clear that Shen Jiayi had deliberately made things hard for Shen Yanxiao during these past few days, but he nevertheless didn\u2019t prevent it. However, at this moment, he nevertheless hung a cordial smile on his face, and said to the ignorant Shen Yanxiao, \u201cSeventh younger sister, it\u2019s been exhausting for you for these few days. However, you needn\u2019t worry, for your older brother is here, and your older brother will take good care of you.\u201dHearing this gentle sound, Shen Yifeng, at this moment, had changed into an older brother that was taking care of his younger sister.Shen Yanxiao, nevertheless, held disdain towards people\u2019s sudden arrival of kindness. If Shen Yifeng was truly doing things for her good, he absolutely wouldn\u2019t have allowed Shen Jiayi to deliberately make things difficult for Shen Yanxiao. During these past 3 days, he hadn\u2019t ever shown his face, and today\u2019s act was nothing more than the reason of him wanting to present a genuine good side of his before the sage. Shen Yanxiao had already long discovered that, when she was at the Vermillion Bird Clan, Shen Yifeng would dote on Shen Yanxiao by every means possible, as if she was like his own biological younger sister, every single time Shen Siyu was there. However, so long as Shen Siyu wasn\u2019t there, Shen Yifeng would treat her as if she were invisible. There wasn\u2019t a need to speak about sweet talking for even a glance wasn\u2019t even spared for her.With just that point of his carefulness in thought, Shen Yanxiao had already grasped everything clearly. Towards this kind of a blockhead who couldn\u2019t even be hypocritical all-around, she was disinclined to even take the trouble to share her thoughts with him.Shen Yifeng didn\u2019t hope for this idiot to respond to his goodwill either. What he\u2019d said just now was nothing more than him showing off his benevolence before the sage. One of the other main reasons why people from the God\u2019s Domain were revered by the commoners was because the people from the God\u2019s Domain were always so benevolent when they showed up before others. They loathed sinisterness and darkness, but advocated open heartedness and benevolence.Shen Yifeng naturally knew that he had to express himself at an appropriate time, and this was the best method he could express his benevolence with, which was precisely to treat this idiot well. In any case, this trash wouldn\u2019t threaten him and plunder the Vermillion Bird. Therefore, making an effort on the surface was very simple.Shen Yanxiao\u2019s appearance within this troop hadn\u2019t only become an unfortunate person in substituting Shen Jiayi and Shen Jiawei as a base cushion, but had also became a stage prop for Shen Yifeng to reveal his own positive energy.It couldn\u2019t be helped but said that everyone had all accomplished their best uses in regards to the appearance of this idiot.Seeing Shen Yifeng \u2018show his concern\u2019 for Shen Yanxiao, the sage\u2019s smiling expression deepened by a little at the corner of his lips, but inside his eyes, a beam of expression that people couldn\u2019t grasp flashed.Liked it?

As she looked at the cave that the heatwave was surging out of, the bottom of her heart began to emit a trace of dread. The God\u2019s Domain was well known for its benevolence, so she\u2019d deliberately displayed her loveliness, pitifulness, and shyness as she\u2019d stood beside the sage, in order to win his favourable impression.The sage shot a glance towards Shen Jiayi and nodded his head.\u201cThe Vermillion Bird is indeed inside. There\u2019s no need to worry, for as of right now, the Vermillion Bird is in a state of dormancy, and it won\u2019t harm anyone.\u201dAfter everyone had finished making their preparations, they finally headed into the pitch-black cave.The 18 God\u2019s envoys were split into 2 batches, with one of the batches at the front clearing the way, while the other batch walked behind everyone else to prevent any unexpected occurrences.After having headed into the cave, the God\u2019s envoys whom were in front immediately let loose the Light Congealing Crystals that were in their hands, and allowed them to fly. Light Congealing Crystals were a type of extraordinary material that could be used for illumination. It only needed a magician to pour his magic into the crystal. It\u2019d then float in mid air after it was let go, and would send out a dazzling and dull light halo to serve as an illumination torch.Along this journey, at least a dozen Congealing LIght Crystals illuminated the pitch-black cave.Only afterwards did the people noticed the dim red light that winked and flashed from the walls of the cave. The long, thin red marks resembled buried magma, as they flashed with supernatural light, like countless blood-red vines growing throughout the cave.Shen Yanxiao was walking behind everyone\u2019s back, with her big eyes sweeping across these strange red mark. Faintly, she smelt a puff of an exceedingly thin yet very eccentric smell.It was somewhat fragrant and sweet, but also somewhat fishy. This smell made her somewhat at a loss.The pitch-black darkness of the cave expanded unboundedly. With the passing of the time, when people looked back in the direction of the cave\u2019s entrance, there wasn\u2019t any scene that could be seen\u2014there was only the radiance-covered Light Congealing Crystals.\u201cJust how much longer do we need to walk? It\u2019s getting hotter and hotter here.\u201d Shen Jiawei was somewhat afraid. He closely followed at Shen Jiayi to the side. Even under the protection of the Ice Silk Armour, he still felt that the high temperature was becoming more and more unbearable. Drop after drop of beads of sweat were seeping out of his forehead, and a layer of blush had also appeared on his face.Within this party of people, apart from Shen Yanxiao who couldn\u2019t cultivate magic and Dou Qi, Shen Jiawei\u2019s strength was considered to be the lowest. Towards the high temperature that was brought about by the Vermillion Bird, it truly was somewhat hard to bear with his strength.\u201cI don\u2019t know. We should be reaching it soon. Try to bear with it.\u201d Shen Jiayi\u2019s mind was also uncertain. Looking at the flushing complexion of his brother, she was suddenly very curious on just what the circumstances that idiot was in, in this kind of unbearably torrid and hot place.Shen Jiayi turned her head and looked at Shen Yanxiao who was walking behind her. She\u2019d originally believed that she herself would see the sheet of a face that was dripping with sweat and that was utterly exhausted. However, Shen Yanxiao whom was walking behind them nevertheless just looked like that she was alright. Don\u2019t speak about her dripping with sweat, for not even a drop of sweat could be found on that small unprepossessing face.This was strange, for even she, whom was on the eve of breaking through to rank 6, would somewhat felt that torrid heat here. How was it that there unexpectedly wasn\u2019t even the slightest bit of anomaly with her?The disparity between before one reached rank 6 and after one reached rank 6 in Dou Qi and magic were enormous. Shen Jiayi had cultivated to rank 5, but she hadn\u2019t surmounted rank 6. Therefore, she had no way to completely resist the high temperature here, only those that had succeeded in promoting oneself to rank 6 and higher could. Shen Yifeng, who\u2019d already became a 3-star Sword Scholar, didn\u2019t receive the slightest influence.However, what was the matter with this Shen Yanxiao? She was obviously a trash that couldn\u2019t even cultivate, so how could she be even more relaxed than Shen Jiayi and Shen Jiawei?Liked it?

Only after staring blankly at her for a moment, did they withdraw their line of sight.Being unclear of what the matter was with those two brats, Shen Yanxiao was too disinclined to think much about it.Little did she know that since, under Xiu\u2019s coercion, she\u2019d already broken through to rank 6, she already possessed the capability to resist the high temperature. After she\u2019d entered the cave, she just hadn\u2019t felt that anything was wrong, and she\u2019d only regarded it as an effect of the Ice Silk Armour. Her thoughts simply didn\u2019t head in the direction of her rank.The road was very long, and it appeared as if there wasn\u2019t an end. Even if there was bright light from the Light Congealing Crystals, it nevertheless still caused the likes of people whom had entered the Vermillion Bird\u2019s nest for the first time, such as Shen Yifeng, to be incessantly prudent. They closely followed the back of the sage, fearing that if they got too far from the sage, some unclean things inside of the cave would jump out and attack them.Only Shen Yanxiao incessantly snickered as she innocently looked at the group of Vermillion Bird\u2019s third generation people, whom were well-behaved as they followed closely behind the sage, like a flock of quail.Finally, after everyone had been oppressed for a long time, they crossed to the end of the path, and arrived in a wide cave.In the entire cave, more than 20 Light Congealing Crystals had been placed, which only now illuminated the interior thoroughly.Under the illumination of the Light Congealing Crystals, everything inside of the cave appeared before everyone\u2019s eyes.A dark stone column reached from the ground to the roof of the cave. The stone column was roughly the thickness of ten grown men combined together. It was covered in a dark red totem. A huge obsidian had been erected at the bottom of the stone column. Above the obsidian was an egg the size of a human head. These things were what greeted everyone\u2019s vision.That\u2019s right, that was an egg!On that varying contrast of fiery-red coloured eggshell was actually the flame totem. There was a small portion of the bottom of the egg that was embedded within the incomparably hard obsidian. The cracks extended from the bottom of the egg throughout entire piece of obsidian.The split second that Shen Yifeng saw the Vermillion Bird egg, he just couldn\u2019t shift his line of sight away, and his heart began beating wildly.The entire cave was flooded with a formidable fire element. Therefore, every time someone breathed, they were able to feel a portion of surging heat enter into their thoracic cavity. Even if one had already broken through to rank 6, one would still be incapable of resisting the extremely tyrannical invasion of fire element.The brother and sister pair, Shen Jiayi and Shen Jiawei, had already been choked till both of their eyes were extremely red by breathing the fire element into their lungs, but their sights were extremely unwilling to leave the Vermillion Bird egg.\u201cThis is the Vermilion Bird?\u201d Shen Yifeng was uncertain as he asked the sage. As he surveyed the entire cave, there had only been this egg before his eyes that could draw a relationship with the Vermillion Bird.The sage smiled and nodded his head. The formidable fire element simply didn\u2019t cause any unwellness to him at all.Having lain dormant for more than a hundred years, the Vermillion Bird that\u2019d once given the Vermillion Bird Clan supreme honor, was now in the shape of an egg before everyone\u2019s line of sight.An egg\u2026Standing behind everyone, Shen Yanxiao silently looked at that egg that seemed quite valiant, but in her mind, she was laughing till she was spurting out blood.She finally realised just why the Vermillion Bird would go through such labour like this to clear out such a vast stretch of area, just to make a vow on itself for territorial authority\u2014because the appearance of the incomparably formidable mythological animal was unexpectedly an egg! If it was to run into some magical beast that didn\u2019t opened its eyes, and was to mistakenly treat this big and somewhat irregular egg before its eyes as a meal\u2026and then gnaw on it\u2026it really wasn\u2019t known whether or not the Vermillion Bird that was inside would dream of itself being torn apart and being swollen inside the beasts stomach.Although the aura of this egg was formidable, in the end, it was just an egg!Liked it?

The Vermillion Bird that was right in front of their eyes was an opportunity for the Vermilion Bird Clan to receive the highest honor! So just how could Shen Yifeng not be excited? From the beginning he\u2019d never even placed Shen Jiayi and Shen Jiawei in his eyes, because they didn\u2019t have that seniority to do so, nor the ability to make a stand and fight against him!The Vermillion Bird was bound to be his!Shen Jiayi and Shen Jiawei secretly stared at Shen Yifeng. Although their gifts were pretty good, they were inevitably somewhat lacking in confidence when facing Shen Yifeng. During ordinary times, they wouldn\u2019t dare to be too excessive against him. Although they were all cousins, the relationship between Shen Yue and Shen Duan had always been disharmonious, and thus the interrelationship between their children had naturally been just as bad.If it wasn\u2019t because of the fact that their strengths weren\u2019t as strong as Shen Yifeng, Shen Jiayi and Shen Jiawei would\u2019ve already joined hands long ago to suppress their elder cousin.However, before their eyes was a proper big opportunity and yet, they could only let it slip away from them. The two of them couldn\u2019t help but to secretly cursed Shen Yifeng to be ignored by the Vermillion Bird, and hope that it was unwilling to sign a contract with him. If this happened, then they\u2019d naturally have the opportunity to obtain the Vermillion Bird\u2019s good graces.Who wouldn\u2019t want this kind of instant success opportunity? Since they themselves weren\u2019t able to obtain it, then they naturally wouldn\u2019t allow others to obtain it.The open fighting and covert maneuvering amongst the third generation of the Vermillion Bird Clan was all so well hidden that the God\u2019s Envoys from the God\u2019s Domain didn\u2019t have the heart to go and conjecture about the internal contradiction of the entire family.The 18 God\u2019s Envoys all distinguishedly stood more than 10 steps from the obsidian in succession, forming a circle with the Vermillion Bird as their core.The sage unhurriedly walked towards the Vermillion Bird egg that was loosely sending out high temperatures. It was unknown as of when a huge golden compass appeared within the palm of his hand. On the compass was a subdivision of 4 circles. There were some ancient designs carved into it on each one of the circular paths. On the outermost layer of the circle, the pattern of the 4 mythological animals of ancient times was carved into the directions of east, south, west, and north.The distance between the sage and Shen Yanxiao was quite far, so she was able to distantly see that the golden compass within the hands of the sage was unceasingly revolving.Along with that brittle snapping sound that echoed, the golden compass stopped revolving. A countable amount of rays of light were shoot out from the golden compass. Under the illumination of the rays of light, a fiery red light and shadow astonishingly emerged in mid-air. It was similar to a blazing bird spreading its wings and soaring. It was emitting dazzling flame all over. An immense fiery bird spiralled in midair. In the time it takes one to wink, it\u2019d turned into a path of red rays of light that rushed into the immobile Vermillion Bird egg.Everything that they\u2019d seen before their eyes had the 8 people from the Vermillion Bird Clan stupefied; they simply didn\u2019t know that what that golden compass that was within the sage\u2019s hand was. They were even unsure of whether or not the sudden appearance followed by disappearance of the tremendous fiery bird into the Vermillion Bird egg was a hallucination of theirs.All of these things had already exceeded the scope of their cognition.All of a sudden, a tremendous swaying occurred within inside the broad cave. During the time that the soil that was below Shen Yanxiao\u2019s feet was vibrating, the soil unexpectedly split open with numerous amount of cracks. Through the cracks, she could clearly see that beneath the soil\u2014there was unceasing, flowing lava. The fiery lava was approximately a meter under her feet. White-coloured steam was unceasingly jettinging out from the cracks in the ground. The scalding temperature made people have the illusion that they themselves had been placed inside a steamer basket.Liked it?

Apart from the God\u2019s envoys, whom could still be counted as unperturbed inside the cave, the other 7 people from the Vermillion Bird Clan had long ago become a big mess. The two siblings, Shen Jiayi and Shen Jiawei, miserably shrieked as they climbed onto their retinues\u2019 body. Shen Yifeng hurriedly evaded the cracks that were under his feet, while on his face, there was no longer the confidence and at ease look of his former days. Under his panic, his face had become deathly white.\u2018The Vermillion Bird is about to awake.\u2019 Xiu\u2019s voice was transmitted into Shen Yanxiao\u2019s mind.A rupturing sound could be heard amidst the bustle. The Vermillion Bird egg that was originally quietly laying down on the obsidian had had its shell split open into numerous cracks, and a dazzling red radiance shone out from within the cracks.Along with an extreme portion of heat that swept through the entire cave, the fire-red radiance had shrouded everyone\u2019s line of sights.Nobody was able to see anything except for the fiery-red scene.Panic spread in everyone\u2019s hearts.Luckily, after that dazzling radiance had radiated momentarily, it gradually weakened, and gradually advanced and gathered upon the obsidian.In the time it takes to blink, the obsidian suddenly looked like it had been ignited by an immense lump of flame, and was raging and combusting.Within the flame, a delicate, tiny hand was stretched out. It was as if the flame had a spirit, for it had rapidly covered that delicate tiny hand. The converging heat and flame was a fiery armor stuck to that small arm.As the flames gradually converged, a boy who seemed to be about three or four years old appeared before everyone\u2019s eyes.His scarlet-red long hair was draped over his shoulder. His refined facial features were similar to one of Heaven\u2019s most outstanding work of arts. Even if it was the most refined work of art, it too would fall short when compared to the complexion of this young child by at least 0.01%.On that young, tender, and small yet refined face that had people gasping in surprise, were a pair of scarlet-coloured eyes that were like a dazzling flame. Inside of those eyes wasn\u2019t the sincerity of a child, but rather was a type of absolute supremacy!The flame fit onto the little boy\u2019s body like a fiery armor, and accompanied the little boy as it stayed suspended in the air.It obviously was a very small body and yet, it had adopted a haughty seating posture in midair. That pair of very small legs were arrogantly folded. That little bastard had single-handedly supported his lower jaw, and was gazing down with his pair of scarlet eyes as he towered above this group of dumbstruck humans beneath it.The likes of people such as Shen Yifeng were thoroughly dumbstruck when they raised their heads and looked at the absolutely unusual little boy. In their hearts, they\u2019d practically already guessed his identity but\u2026They simply found it hard to believe that this little bastard, whose arrogance that\u2019d turned egotistical before their eyes, was the Vermillion Bird from the folklores!Where was the mythological animal that\u2019d been properly discussed?!\u201cStupid humans, do you know the consequences of disturbing my rest?\u201d This ghastly voice was transmitted out from the mouth of the little boy. Along with that ghastly voice, was a trace of a puerile voice that was carried along as it echoed out. The temperature within the entire cave was immediately raised by a lot.Shen Jiayi and Shen Jiawei were repeatedly subjected to the need to gasp for breath by the sudden raised in temperature, but they were also afraid that the high temperature that they\u2019d breathed into their bodies would bring about immense injuries, thus they couldn\u2019t help but use their hands to cover their mouths and noses.The little boy had arrogantly swept his glance towards the people that were inside the cave. After its vision fell upon the sage that had a smiling expression, it slightly frowned.\u201cI loathe that smile of yours.\u201d The little hand waved, and an earth-shattering flame like a tide threw itself towards the sage.Within the hand of the sage, a golden radiance shone out and then struck the flame that had been launched towards at the sage. A rumbling sound was then produced.\u201cSurely enough, the Vermillion Bird was as haughty as the rumours. The humble me is the current sage of the God\u2019s Domain.\u201d The sage\u2019s gentle voice was accompanied by a rumbling sound.Liked it?

After this many years, there really hasn\u2019t been the slightest change\u2014I still loathe you guys this much.\u201d Although the words that it\u2019d said were very blunt, the Vermilion Bird hadn\u2019t launched another attack yet.Only after hearing the sage call the young child the Vermillion Bird, did everyone from the Vermillion Bird Clan verify their own conjectures in their hearts.After a magical beast\u2019s rank had reached a certain height, a portion of them were able to transform into the shape of a human. As for the mythological animals, they were much more formidable existences compared to magical beasts, thus it was naturally a very simple matter for them to transform into the shape of a human.As they thought about the young child before their eyes that was precisely the Vermillion Bird\u2019s embodiment, everyone\u2019s gaze on the Vermilion Bird became more and more passionate!This was their clan\u2019s hope! This was their clan\u2019s mythological animal!\u201cYour excellency, the Vermillion Bird! I am the 12th generation disciple of the Vermillion Bird Clan! Today I apologize for troubling His Highness, and for the sage bothering Your Excellency, the Vermillion Bird really. I didn\u2019t mean to intentionally offend you. Merely, Your Excellency, the Vermillion Bird has been laying dormant for a long time, and everyone in our clan have all been looking forward to welcoming your return!\u201d Shen Yifeng was the first one to jump out, and carried out an unprecedented worship to the Vermillion Bird. Although the Vermillion Bird\u2019s form had him incessantly astonished, it had already just recently and unexpectedly dared to make a move against the sage. Not only was the sage not the slightest bit angry, instead, the sage was very modest. It was very evident that the mythological animal possessed a strong acquaintance with the God\u2019s Domain that wasn\u2019t known to anyone. Moreover, the Vermillion Bird whom had made a move just now had already made Shen Yifeng unceasingly stunned.That sort of pure fire element was the purest that he\u2019d seen in all of his life!Any other magical beast wouldn\u2019t be sufficient when compared to the Vermillion Bird\u2019s strength! The Vermillion Bird was worthy of being a mythological animal that was situated at the peak of the fire element!As the Vermillion Bird coldly shot a glance towards Shen Yifeng, who was kneeling on his knee, the corner of its rosy mouth evoked a haughty smiling expression.\u201cWelcoming my return? Hehe, the human race is still just as hypocritical as before. Are you the one that wanted to sign a contract with me?\u201dThe Vermillion Bird\u2019s voice wasn\u2019t in the slightest bit tactful, and instantly had everyone staring blankly at it.Shen Yanxiao blinked her eyes. She incessantly snickered as she looked at that \u2018mythological animal\u2019 that had shockingly appeared, and at the fact that words that it spoke were very straightforward. It was very clear that Shen Yifeng\u2019s segment of flattering and extravagant embellishment simply didn\u2019t gain a favourable impression with the Vermillion Bird at all. With regards to the human race\u2019s cunning plots, how could the mythological animal that had already lived for more than a million years still not understand?The so called \u2018welcoming his return\u2019 was, in the end, nothing more than wanting to sign a contract with him to obtain a formidable strength!Shen Yifeng was obviously horribly suppressed by the Vermillion Bird within that short period of time, and didn\u2019t know to reply. He could only silently hold back the tears in his heart.The mythological animal was truly bullying people too much. It was acceptable that it didn\u2019t appear in the form of an animal, but after appearing in a human form, it had still gone and directly exposed his tactful praise like this!Only after a good half of a day, was he able to properly put his fragmented confidence in order. Shen Yifeng said, \u201cIf this humble me is to be able to have the fortune to obtain Your Excellency, the Vermillion Bird\u2019s, good graces, then it naturally is blessing for my next three lifetimes. Your Excellency, the Vermilion Bird, please do still give me an opportunity!\u201dThe Vermillion Bird\u2019s gaze swept past the eagerness that was on Shen Yifeng\u2019s face, and its fiery-red eyebrows slightly wrinkled as it coldly snorted, saying, \u201cGet out of here! I\u2019m not fond of you.\u201dNot fond of\u2026Not\u2026fond\u2026of\u2026The six words that the Vermillion Bird had spit out from its mouth made Shen Yifeng, whom was closely-packed with confidence, into a rigid statue in a flash. It had been a long time since the number one genius of the Vermillion Bird Clan\u2019s self-confidence and pride had been instantly broken down into fine powder.Shen Yifeng foolishly looked at the Vermillion Bird, for he didn\u2019t dare to believe that the Vermillion Bird would be so unexpectedly blunt and veto himself.So much so that, he didn\u2019t even get the time to display anything at all, and had been instantly renounced!Liked it?

Part 2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euAt this moment, Shen Yifeng had suffered from an unprecedented shock, and his eyes had lost the luster of his former days.Shen Yifeng\u2019s bitter experience had the two siblings, whom incessantly hated him, both alarmed and delighted. The reason why they were so unreconciled was because of Shen Yifeng\u2019s splendor being too dazzling, and under the canopy of Shen Yifeng\u2019s talent, the two siblings simply hadn\u2019t had the chance to stick out in the Vermillion Bird Clan.However, just now, in front of everyone, the Vermillion Bird had rejected Shen Yifeng\u2019s trial.Then, wouldn\u2019t that mean that the two of them now had the chance to compete for the Vermillion Bird?Overjoyed at the unexpected good news, Shen Jiayi and Shen Jiawei barely even masked their happiness and excitement. At the same time, the two incomparably close twins had spaced themselves apart to a certain amount in a split second.At this moment, Shen Jiayi and Shen Jiawei were no longer of the same mind towards withstanding their enemies.Their counterparts were the only opponents that could compete with them for the Vermillion Bird\u2019s right of inheritance. Any person would be incapable of resisting this sort of enticement when they were confronted with the formidable strength that the Vermillion Bird would bring them.\u201cJiawei, I\u2019m your sister, so this one time, I should be the first one to go.\u201d Shen Jiayi competitively looked at her younger brother. After Shen Yifeng had been eliminated, she was the Vermillion Bird Clan\u2019s strongest existence amongst the third generation, and she was also the person most likelyto obtain the Vermillion Bird\u2019s good graces.She absolutely wouldn\u2019t allow anyone to contest with her for the Vermillion Bird at this moment\u2014even if it was her own biological younger brother. Even he couldn\u2019t.Shen Jiawei ground his teeth as he looked at Shen Jiayi. Since a long time ago, he\u2019d complied with everything that Shen Jiayi had commanded, and would perform it because one, Shen Jiayi had been born a few minutes earlier than him, and two, Shen Jiayi\u2019s strength was slightly higher than his by a little. However, this didn\u2019t simply mean that he was a brainless idiot. He knew that the current circumstances were the best opportunity for him to emancipate himself. After having his head continuously pushed down by Shen Jiayi, how could Shen Jiawei not think of emancipating himself?Stubbornly straightening up his courage, for the first time since he was born, Shen Jiawei rebelled against his own elder sister.\u201cSister, you are after all a girl, and someday in the future, you\u2019ll have to get married. And when that happens, the Vermillion Bird Clan will still need a man to inherit!\u201d He was unwilling to concede! With the current circumstances, whoever was the first to be intimate with the Vermillion Bird would be the most probable to sign a contract with it.Shen Jiayi sneered as she looked at her younger brother.\u201cJiawei, your courage is truly getting larger and larger, for you to unexpectedly dare to rebel against me!\u201dShen Jiayi\u2019s tone still wasn\u2019t powerful nor did it resonate. A path of flame was shot flying towards Shen Jiawei. Having completely let down his guard against this strike, Shen Jiawei was sent flying a few meters by the flame ball.\u201cIdiot! Just relying on yourself, you also dare to contest with me?!\u201d Shen Jiayi shot a glance at Shen Jiawei who was on the ground. She then turned around and walked towards the Vermillion Bird.Shen Yanxiao, who was standing to the side was dumbstruck by the show from the two sibling\u2019s fall out with each other before her eyes. Shen Jiayi had been seriously fierce. That flame ball that had sent Shen Jiawei flying just now was precisely the one that Shen Jiayi had wanted to use on that very day to deal with her. However, no matter how much hatred Shen Jiayi had on that very day, she nevertheless wouldn\u2019t dare to directly have the flame ball attack her own body.Although a flame ball that was cast from rank 5 magic was far from being that tyrannical compared to a magician, a flame ball that hit the body of a human who wasn\u2019t guarding against it at all would nevertheless be sufficient enough to bring about immense injuries. Today, Shen Jiayi unexpectedly hadn\u2019t had even the smallest misgivings in regards to her relationship between her and her younger brother. She\u2019d directly sent a flame ball towards Shen Jiawei due to her greed for the Vermillion Bird\u2014she simply didn\u2019t care anymore!Shen Yanxiao looked at Shen Jiawei, whom had fallen onto the ground, and who was having difficulty crawling back up. Inevitably, in her heart, she\u2019d observed a moment of silence in tribute for him, for him to have an older sister as vicious and merciless as this.Merely\u2026The fight between the two brats was something that she liked the most!!Liked it?

With strenuous effort, he crawled back up from the ground, and helplessly looked on as Shen Jiayi walked towards the Vermillion Bird. She then respectfully kneeled on a single leg before the Vermillion Bird, and expressed her goodwill towards the Vermillion Bird.\u201cWomen of the human race?! They are what I loathe the most!\u201dAccompanied with the Vermillion Bird\u2019s fidgety roaring voice, Shen Jiayi felt a puff of formidable heat hit her in the face. In the next second, her petite body was like a kite flying with its string snapped. She fell extremely hard, not to far from Shen Jiawei.\u201c\u2026\u201d Shen Yanxiao rashly swallowed the saliva that had gathered at the corner of her mouth from her laugher.This Vermillion Bird was indeed\u2026Too forceful! Too forceful!However strangely, what was more, was that the more she looked at this arrogant little bird, the more pleasing it seemed to her eyes\u2026However, just now, hadn\u2019t the Vermillion Bird said that the women of the human race were what it loathed the most? Something was fishy here! However\u2026Shen Yanxiao had silently lowered her head and looked at her \u2018penniless\u2019 chest. Although they still hadn\u2019t begun to grow\u2026 still\u2026she ought to be considered part of the human race\u2019s women!\u201cHey! This little bird is rather hard to take care of. What\u2019s to be done if he ignores me because of my gender?\u201d Seeing that everyone\u2019s attention wasn\u2019t on her body, Shen Yanxiao hurriedly inquired to Xiu.Xiu\u2019s neither fast nor slow voice echoed,\u2018Who, the likes of you? Can also be counted as a woman?\u2019Shen Yanxiao felt that the fact that she was a woman had suffered unprecedented disregard!So much so that she was able to imagine that, if Xiu were to have a body right now, his eyes would certainly swept past her chest with extreme disdain.You fucker, you\u2019re too much of a bully!Even if she was poorly developed, after two years of proper nursing, what should\u2019ve grown would still grow, right?!When Shen Yanxiao was tangled in the thoughts of why she herself wasn\u2019t a woman, a smiling expression one of rejoicing in other people\u2019s misfortune was shown on Shen Jiawei\u2019s face.Upon seeing that Shen Jaiyi, whom had tried to forestall his step towards obtaining the Vermillion Bird by making a move on him, had received an extremely bloody attack from the Vermillion Bird, Shen Jiawei smiled!\u201cShen Yifeng? Shen Jiayi? In the end, the person who\u2019ll be obtaining the Vermillion Bird will only be me!\u201d Tremblingly, Shen Jiawei stood back up from the ground while his heart brimmed with happiness. In quick succession, the Vermillion Bird had vetoed two well-known figures from the Vermillion Bird Clan\u2019s third generation, and now the Vermillion Bird Clan only had him as a candidate to inherit the Vermillion Bird.Everytime the Vermillion Bird had awoken, it would certainly pick one amongst all of the Vermillion Bird Clan\u2019s disciples that had formally come, and would become the target of its devotion and vow its loyalty. With Shen Yifeng and Shen Jiayi having flunked now, there was only he that had the capabilities to possess the Vermillion Bird!Not paying attention to the pain his body was experiencing, Shen Jiawei walked towards the Vermillion Bird that was on the eve of belonging to him with large strides.Shen Yifeng\u2019s unsightly complexion had become extreme, for he\u2019d never thought that he\u2019d be outdone by these two mediocre siblings. However, the Vermillion Bird\u2019s rejection was one that wouldn\u2019t preserve one\u2019s face, and he already knew that he himself wouldn\u2019t have any opportunity.Shen Jiayi\u2019s complexion was even more unsightly, for that one strike from the Vermillion Bird hadn\u2019t been any more tender even though she was of the fairer sex. Although it was one brandish that was done in passing, it nevertheless already had Shen Jiayi\u2019s five viscera and six bowels incessantly clutching in pain like they\u2019d been jolted and broken into pieces. The her could only barely maintain herself enough to be clear-headed and look at her younger brother, whom was wounded by her a moment ago, head for the Vermillion Bird. At this moment, she was incessantly regretting, for never was there anyone that had told her that the Vermillion Bird loathed women. If she\u2019d known this earlier, that she herself simply completely lacked the hope to do so, she absolutely wouldn\u2019t have had an acrimonious falling out with Shen Jiawei.She certainly would\u2019ve aided Shen Jiawei in obtaining the Vermillion Bird\u2019s good graces.However, all of these things were already too late, because the moment when the flame had been ejected from her hand, it had immediately shattered the many years of mutual affection between them as siblings.

As he approached the Vermillion Bird, he constantly fantasized that after he\u2019d become the Vermillion Bird Clan\u2019s clan head\u2019s successor, he\u2019d definitely have Shen Yifeng assigned to the branch family, for he\u2019d long ago not seen eye to eye with this unbound, well-regarded older cousin of his, because he himself was definitely Shen Feng\u2019s grandson\u2014yet his position hadn\u2019t been able to compare with Shen Yifeng all along? As for this sister of his? Since she was the one that wasn\u2019t benevolent to him first, then she couldn\u2019t blame him for his injustice later!Then, there was also this idiot, Shen Yanxiao. The moment he\u2019d obtained the Vermillion Bird he\u2019d certainly have his grandfather drive this trash out of the Vermillion Bird Clan! He\u2019d be on the eve of succeeding the Vermillion Bird Clan, he absolutely wouldn\u2019t allow a disgraceful existence like this!With his heart fully full of plans, Shen Jiawei finally dragged his bruised body before arriving in front of the Vermillion Bird. Despite his pain, he put on a confident smile then kneeled on one of his knees on the ground. Before the Vermillion Bird, he smiled as he said, \u201cYour excellency, the revered Vermillion Bird, I\u2019m the last disciple of the Vermillion Bird clan within this batch, and am extremely honored to be able to obtain your good-\u201dBefore Shen Jiawei even had the time to finish saying his words, the Vermillion Bird nevertheless abruptly made a snapping sound, and Shen Jiawei\u2019s body was immediately tossed into the air by a formless power.At first, Shen Jiawei was alarmed, but he hadn\u2019t simply been thrown out like Shen Jiayi. It was evident that the Vermillion Bird\u2019s current actions signified that it was very probable that it was in the progress of signing a contract with him!Shen Jiawei elatedly thought.\u201cThe human race really won\u2019t change, even in death! You unexpectedly dare to lie before me!\u201d The Vermillion Bird\u2019s voice was brimming with anger.Shen Jiawei was indirectly thrown out by the Vermillion Bird the next second, and his beautiful dream subsequently shattered as well.The confused Shen Jiawei whom was thrown down simply didn\u2019t understood, for in the end, just what words of his were a lie, to have unexpectedly provoked the Vermillion Bird\u2019s anger.Confronting with Shen Jiawei\u2019s cruel treatment, Shen Yifeng and Shen Jiayi\u2019s facial expressions became incomparably complicated.They were naturally very happy that Shen Jiawei didn\u2019t obtain the Vermillion Bird\u2019s acknowledgement, but after the Vermillion Bird had declined Shen Jiawei, it could be said that they, their party of people, had been completely wiped out. The Vermillion Bird simply hadn\u2019t picked anyone among them, and this simply didn\u2019t make any sense!At the time where everyone was still perplexed despite many thoughts, the Vermillion Bird\u2019s figure unhurriedly floated towards the corner of the cave. Under everyone\u2019s astonished gazes, he then lightly landed on the ground and stood before Shen Yanxiao, the one whom had hidden in the corner and watched the good show from the start to finish.Shen Yifeng, Shen Jiayi, and Shen Jiawei\u2019s complexions turned to an extremely dark shade at the same moment.Your sister!! How could they have forgotten about this idiot!\u2026Shen Yanxiao stood at her original spot, and looked at the arrogant little face that was almost within her reach.The Vermillion Bird\u2019s appearance nevertheless had a very large disparity compared to the human race. That pair of pointy little ears in general could have made Shen Yanxiao associate it to the elves that she\u2019d previously seen in the movies. Those pair of scarlet red eyes definitely didn\u2019t have the proper naiveness of a child, and what was present in them were only a haughtiness\u2014as if nobody in this world could be compared to him.The facial features were so perfect that they couldn\u2019t be disputed.However!She swore that if this self-important little bird dared to have her thrown out as well, she\u2019d certainly have Xiu ruthlessly crush it to death!Liked it?

All high-ranked magical beasts possessed the ability to transform themselves into a human form. Moreover, no matter what type of magical beasts they were, the human form that they transformed into were all exceedingly good-looking, such that those group of people in the Vermillion Bird Clan that were seen as good-looking in the commoners\u2019 eyes, would only be considered as ordinary looking in the eyes of these said magical beasts.There wasn\u2019t even no need to say of the little girl before it, whom was the most ordinary of the ordinary people.In regards to a magical beast\u2019s aesthetics, these kind of people like Shen Yanxiao could only be called ugly.\u201cYou look very ugly.\u201d The Vermillion Bird directly spoke out its evaluation of Shen Yanxiao.The mythological animals had lived for a very, very long duration of time, but with their arrogant temper, they absolutely wouldn\u2019t know how to even write the word \u2018tactful\u2019.The corner of Shen Yanxiao\u2019s mouth twitched as she stared at this stinky bird.It\u2019s not like she\u2019d come here for a beauty contest! For it to have unexpectedly said that she looked very ugly! Someday in the future, he\u2019d better not fall into her hands. Or else, she\u2019d absolutely have his entire body full of feathers plucked!The Vermillion Bird disregarded a certain person\u2019s angry glance, and sized up Shen Yanxiao from top to the bottom. So much so that, he once again went a little bit nearer. Wrinkling his very straight nose on Shen Yanxiao\u2019s body, he sniffed here and there.Is he a dog!!!Shen Yanxiao dumbfoundedly looked at the little bastard before her, whom obviously was a bird, and yet was insisting on sniffing her body here and there. If it wasn\u2019t that she mustn\u2019t expose her strength right now, it was reckoned that she\u2019d have long ago already had this self-important little demon slapped until he\u2019d gone above and beyond the topmost clouds!Judging from Xiu\u2019s tone, it was obvious that Xiu didn\u2019t placed the Vermilion Bird on the same level, and since she already had the existence of Xiu as an unparalleled big supporter, the Vermillion Bird and so on were simply pathetic!After repeatedly sniffing over and over again for a long time, the Vermillion Bird stopped its \u2018observing\u2019 operation that had people feeling freakish.His body size was merely about a three to four year old child, and the him whom was standing on the ground had only reached Shen Yanxiao\u2019s abdomen. As a mythological animal, he absolutely found it intolerable that he was looked down at by a human. He immediately once again floated into the air, and both of his eyes were on the same level as Shen Yanxiao.\u201cOn your body, there\u2019s a whiff of strange smell and just where have I smelt it before.\u201d The Vermillion Bird was somewhat vexed, for this smell was very faint. If he wasn\u2019t this close, he simply wouldn\u2019t be able to smell it. That smell existed within his drawn-out memory, but within this short period of time, he was unable to find the source of the memory.Is he really a dog?!\u2019 Shen Yanxiao speechlessly looked at the Vermillion Bird. Although she\u2019d strived to maintain the image of an idiot, it didn\u2019t at all mean that she\u2019d act like an idiot who didn\u2019t wash her face and rinse her mouth. So, how would there be some sort of smell on her body?!\u2018It seems like the Vermilion Bird has perceived my existence. It\u2019s just that the last time we met was a millennium ago, and he\u2019s mistakenly regarded my presence as a familiar smell.\u201d Xiu\u2019s voice suddenly rang out in Shen Yanxiao\u2019s mind.A millennium ago\u2026Shen Yanxiao gazed out afar. Xiu, in the end, what was your origin?!\u201cWhose households\u2019 blood exists in your body? Although you look very ugly, you\u2019ll still become a woman later on. However, seeing the fact that you speak less nonsense, I shall reluctantly sign the contract with you!\u201d The Vermillion Bird\u2019s tone in general was like he was stingily giving a charity and had directly jabbed it at some people.Shen Yanxiao inwardly gnashed her teeth\u2014this self-entitled little bird was definitely screwed!The Vermillion Bird\u2019s voice was extremely ear-piercing, but the sound that was transmitted into the other three people\u2019s ears was nevertheless like thunder from a clear sky!Just what sort of joke was this! She was clearly an idiot!Just what was the matter with the Vermillion Bird? It had vetoed them, the well-known figures within this batch of the Vermillion Bird Clan\u2019s third generation, and yet it had picked an idiot like that! What was going on exactly? Was it that the Vermillion Bird had slept too long, and that it had gone crazy?!It was fine for him to pick anyone else, but he\u2019d insisted on selecting an idiot who couldn\u2019t even cultivate Dou Qi or magic.Liked it?

She too is a woman!\u201d Shen Jiayi unwillingly yelled. Just why was it that the same reason that the Vermillion Bird had used to reject her wouldn\u2019t exist when it came to Shen Yanxiao?The Vermillion Bird frowned, for this petty and low human had unexpectedly dared to question him. He coldly snorted, and his vision straightforwardly swept past Shen Yanxiao\u2019s penniless chest.Shen Yanxiao nearly exploded!What are you looking at, you motherfucker! Even if I, your father, only have flat plains right now, there\u2018ll be a day when they will grow up into an alpine!\u201cYour excellency the Vermillion Bird! Please do reconsider, for she\u2019s an idiot! Moreover, she can\u2019t cultivate any magic or Dou Qi. She simply can\u2019t be a match for you!\u201d Shen Jiayi\u2019s words gave birth to a trace of hope for Shen Yifeng, for the Shen Yanxiao such as this simply couldn\u2019t enter the Vermillion Bird\u2019s eyes. He just couldn\u2019t believe that the Vermillion Bird would truly select an idiot as a master!The shouts and screams towards the Vermillion Bird\u2019s ears put him in a bad mood, because there\u2019d never been anyone who\u2019d dared to be pesky by his side when he was selecting people\u2014yet these few humans were truly bothering him to death! Were they treating him as an idiot? Although this human before him was a little bit ugly, both kinds of power, Dou Qi and magic, were nevertheless stored inside her body. Undoubtedly, this was a rarely-seen, once-in-a-century genius of the human race, whom cultivated both Dou Qi and magic\u2014and yet they\u2019d dared to cheat him by saying that this person was trash!As early as the time when the Vermillion Bird had awoken, he\u2019d immediately investigated the strengths of the few people from the Vermillion Bird Clan thoroughly. At the present stage, Shen Yifeng\u2019s strength was the highest. But she was the kind of rarely seen genius who cultivated magic and Dou Qi, and who could, at any second, destroy this pretty boy to the point where even slag wasn\u2019t left over. Everyone had all thought that the Vermillion Bird had picked Shen Yanxiao out of sudden inspiration, but they didn\u2019t know that the Vermillion Bird had long ago already discovered the most outstanding one within their batch of people.Moreover, just where did this girl resemble an idiot? He could obviously see the raging and combusting flames in her eyes. Thus, it was very obvious that this person was one that had wisdom, or else she wouldn\u2019t be happy like this after knowing that she\u2019d been selected by him.As a result of a certain bird who\u2019d considered the anger in a certain person\u2019s eyes as happiness, a beautiful mistake like this had thus taken shape.The Vermillion Bird didn\u2019t pay attention to the three people\u2019s hootings, and the Vermillion Bird\u2019s attitude caused the three of them to be even more nervous.Even if they were to be unpleasant to each other\u2019s eyes once more, it couldn\u2019t be compared to the fact that they were on the eve of being crushed by an idiot, which was much harder to be accepted by them.In spite of the pain on her body, Shen Jiayi glared at Shen Yanxiao, the one who\u2019d stood there at the side from the start till the finish, and hadn\u2019t uttered a word. If her glare could kill people, it was very likely that she\u2019d have long already hacked that idiot into pieces.Just why was it that the entire world\u2019s good stuff had all run into this idiot? Big Brother Siyu had doted a lot on this idiot, and grandfather had unexpectedly allowed this disgrace to be added into their party of troops. In Shen Jiayi\u2019s heart, there was so much of disdain that she had to Shen Yanxiao at this moment\u2014she just had so much hatred towards Shen Yanxiao!She didn\u2019t dare to be rude with the Vermillion Bird, but towards the trash that she\u2019d bullied up till now, whom had never even dared to rebel, she nevertheless didn\u2019t have any misgivings.\u201cYou\u2019re a trash!

You, the child of that bastard, just go and drop dead already.\u201d Shen Jiayi unresigningly said all of the thoughts in her heart, for even if she was to die, she didn\u2019t wish to see this kind of a trash obtain the Vermillion Bird.Endless tirades of insults flooded the entire cave, and that lowly person who was standing in the corner, whom had appeared frail and helpless, didn\u2019t respond at all towards Shen Jiayi\u2019s insult.Unknowingly, the Vermillion Bird\u2019s heart welled up with a portion of anger.This was the person that he\u2019d personally selected, so how could he still have others bully them? If this were to proceed, how could he still keep his prestige as the Vermillion Bird!\u201cYou\u2019re truly ugly, to the point where it people don\u2019t even dare to believe it. The Vermillion Bird Clan has actually already degraded to a stage such of this, to have unexpectedly taught you, this sort of repulsive woman!\u201d The Vermillion Bird unhurriedly tuned over its body, and overlooked at Shen Jiayi whom was half-sitting on the floor. He furiously lifted up his right hand, and Shen Jiayi was immediately lifted up with an invisible power.\u201cAh!!\u201d Shen Jiayi frighteningly shrieked. Shen Yifeng and Shen Jiawei, whom were to the side, were even more shocked as they watched.\u201cBeing the mythological animal that protects the Vermillion Bird Clan, I shall now carry out the cleansing of the Vermillion Bird Clan.\u201d A brash smiling expression was shown on the Vermillion Bird\u2019s small, refined face. He\u2019d originally already hated the hypocritical and shameless features of the human race, yet in front of him, Shen Jiayi had humiliated the person that he\u2019d personally chosen\u2014he absolutely wouldn\u2019t allow this kind of repulsive woman to continue remaining in this world.For there was no one who could bully his people!Shen Jiayi was struggling in midair, but just how formidable was the Vermillion Bird\u2019s strength? It simply wasn\u2019t something that she, such a small human, could contend with.It was as if her neck was being rigidly choked by with an iron grip. Even Shen Jiayi\u2019s breathing became more urgent. As she became more and more unable to breath, her small face that was originally already riddled with scars, momentarily shed off all of its blood-red colour, and became deathly white.Shen Yifeng and Shen Jiawei looked frightenedly at the Vermillion Bird who was in the middle of a violent rage. Under the Vermillion Bird\u2019s suppression and formidable strength, let alone them pleading for leniency for Shen Jiayi, they simply couldn\u2019t move even half an inch of a footstep.As of now, they\u2019d already been scared by the savageness shown by the Vermillion Bird.In seeing that Shen Jiayi\u2019s four limbs had already begun to unceasingly twitch, and that her two eyes had rolled up to only show white, a white silhouette-like-lightning rushed towards Shen Jiayi.In the time it took to blink, Shen Jiayi\u2019s figure was already no longer in midair.The Vermillion Bird angrily looked at the sage whom had intervened in his actions halfway through. His pair of scarlet red eyes stared glaringly towards Shen Jiayi, whom was carried within the sage\u2019s bosom.\u201cYou want to make a move against me?\u201d The Vermillion Bird sneered.The sage was secretly amazed with the Vermillion Bird\u2019s formidability, for when any magical beast was the at the human form that they\u2019d transformed into, the strength that they\u2019d be capable of emitting fell far of their beast form\u2019s. However, the powerful pressure that the Vermillion Bird had let off just now had, nevertheless, had the few God\u2019s envoys by his side have difficulty breathing.Just what kind of formidable strength was this? If the Vermillion Bird were to appear in its beast form now, if he were to ask himself, it was very likely that the sage wasn\u2019t the Vermillion Bird\u2019s match.Liked it?

This time, he\u2019d personally lead this group of people here. If Shen Jiayi were to be killed by the Vermillion Bird now, he would find it hard to explain to Shen Feng.Even if the sage wasn\u2019t fond of this Shen Jiayi who\u2019d rambled viciously, he couldn\u2019t help but take into consideration the Vermillion Bird Clan\u2019s face.If this matter were to spread out\u2014that the younger generation of the Vermillion Bird Clan had been personally handled by the Vermillion Bird\u2014it\u2019d be rather unsightly.The Vermillion Bird sneered. Its puerile voice was mixed with an absolutely high amount of haughtiness.\u201cWhy would I care about humanity\u2019s evaluation? This woman was so rude to the person that I selected, and she didn\u2019t have any necessity to continue living.\u201d She was nothing more than a very small human that he could instantly kill with a movement of his finger.The sage smiled as he said, \u201cI naturally know that you simply don\u2019t care about humanity\u2019s way of looking at things, but after all, there\u2019s still the Vermillion Bird Clan\u2019s blood relation left in this child\u2019s body. I believe that even with that tempers of yours, it ought to be unlikely of you to be willing to be that decisive, just like this, towards the later generations of your previous master.\u201dSure enough, there was no one from the God\u2019s Domain that was any good, for they\u2019d unexpectedly dared to bring out this set of general truths. The Vermillion Bird coldly snorted, but he knew that this move from the sage was already him showing it that he clearly wanted to protect Shen Jiayi. Although he wasn\u2019t afraid of the sage, for the time being, he simply didn\u2019t want to make an enemy out of the God\u2019s Domain.Although he loathed the people from the God\u2019s Domain, they\u2019d nevertheless concealed an exceedingly large amount of power.\u201cThis child is still young, and isn\u2019t sensible. You don\u2019t have to take what she\u2019s said seriously. After all, it wouldn\u2019t be too fitting for you, who\u2019s been lying dormant for century, to see blood right after you\u2019ve been awaken with great difficulty. As for this child\u2019s rudeness, someday, I\u2019ll naturally tell the current head of the Vermillion Bird Clan, and leave it for him to take care off. So, please feel reassured.\u201d The sage clearly knew when dealing with the Vermillion Bird, a mythological animal with this kind of strength, that he couldn\u2019t be too unyielding, and could only go with the flow.The Vermillion Bird was taciturn for a moment, and considering it to be him selling his face to the God\u2019s Domain\u2014he no longer insisted in taking Shen Jiayi\u2019s life. However, in order to prevent those people who couldn\u2019t distinguish right and wrong from once more coming and bullying his future master, there was a need for him to warn them.\u201cIf, someday in the future, I hear someone speak words that they shouldn\u2019t be speaking, then I certainly won\u2019t be as nice like this, speaking to you and all. As that person was unable to control their own mouth, I won\u2019t mind having that person and their mouth disappear from this world altogether.\u201dThe Vermillion Bird\u2019s fierce move just now had long ago had everyone from the Vermillion Bird Clan frightened to the point of having their souls fly away and scatter. As of now , how could they still dare to say even half a sentence of fault about Shen Yanxiao.It wasn\u2019t like that they were tired of living and wanted to court death!People such as Shen Yifeng had obediently covered their own mouths tightly, to prevent troubling thoughts being issued out of their mouths, and from offending this extremely conceited mythological animal.They weren\u2019t idiots and they didn\u2019t harbour the slightest bit of suspicions regarding the reliability of the Vermillion Bird\u2019s words.Ah, what unwillingness!With regards to the current state of affairs, the two people whom were laying on the ground practically couldn\u2019t bear to look straight, because they, whom were fully-packed with confidence, had unexpectedly been crushed by the idiot\u2014the one that they most despised. If this was to be known to their fathers, it was very likely that it could have their fathers angered till they spit blood.However, no matter how much more unwillingness they had, they too were unable to influence the Vermillion Bird\u2019s decision.With both of his arms folded at his chest, the Vermillion Bird looked at the \u2018passionate\u2019 expression in Shen Yanxiao\u2019s eyes, as he arrogantly drew closer.\u201cPlace a drop of your blood in between my eyebrows, and I\u2019ll be your mythological beast for the entirety of your lifetime.\u201d He disliked signing contracts with the human race, but he had to carry out his own promise of that time. Fortunately, the lifespan of a human simply wasn\u2019t long at all. At most, after a century, he could return to his own cave and go back into a dormant state.The next time, he\u2019d certainly find a place that was even more concealed, for he didn\u2019t want to be awoken again by those group of scoundrels from the God\u2019s Domain even the tiniest bit.Liked it?

Just now, how could she not have any reaction towards Shen Jiayi\u2019s insult to her? However, she wasn\u2019t an anxious idiot, because someday in the future, she\u2019d have the time and the methods to fix this kind of brat. It was just that the Vermillion Bird\u2019s protection towards her had exceeded her anticipation.Although from start to finish this stinky, little bird had displayed a disdainful appearance to her, that attitude of his just now, of fiercely protecting her, was nevertheless same as Shen Siyu.In Shen Yanxiao\u2019s heart, she couldn\u2019t help but say that the dislike that she had for this stinky little bird had eased by a little bit after experiencing this one matter just now.Although this bird\u2019s temperament was a little stinky, it actually couldn\u2019t be considered to be beyond redemption.Everyone was waiting for Shen Yanxiao to sign the contract with the Vermillion Bird, while at the same time, everyone from the Vermillion Bird Clan was all doubting whether or not, with the intelligence of that idiot, she capable of comprehending the Vermillion Bird\u2019s words.It had to be known that Shen Yanxiao\u2019s wisdom was merely at the level of a four year old child\u2019s, and she wouldn\u2019t understand what she\u2019d heard if the words were slightly complicated\u2014and only a ghost would know whether or not she\u2019d understood what the Vermillion Bird had spoken of.People such as Shen Yifeng couldn\u2019t help but to maliciously think from the bottom of their hearts. Shen Yanxiao\u2019s idiocy would absolutely bring about a discontentment to the Vermillion Bird, for she was simply unable to independently carry out the signing of the contract. Once she\u2019d offended the Vermillion Bird, they could still perhaps have the opportunity to win over the Vermillion Bird!All three of them didn\u2019t want to have Shen Yanxiao, this idiot, climb up to the top above their own heads. Who could\u2019ve known that Shen Feng would have Shen Yanxiao, the biggest joke of the Vermillion Bird Clan in hundred of years, take on the seat of clan leader, due to the reason that the one who obtained the Vermillion Bird would be the one that became the clan leader.If this idiot were to succeed the Vermillion Bird Clan, then the three of them could just collectively suicide by drowning themselves in a river!They could practically imagine that, after Shen Yanxiao took the seat as the clan leader, everyone from the Long Xuan Empire would treat them as a national joke. An idiotic clan leader guiding the clan\u2026They didn\u2019t dare to continue thinking about it!After the awakening of the Vermillion Bird, the God Domain\u2019s people had then quietly stood aside. They collectively completely erased their presences and, one after another, promising youths of the Vermillion Bird Clan had suffered from defeat and had fallen in their eyes. After they\u2019d seen that the Vermillion Bird had finally chosen an idiot as its future master, although they didn\u2019t have the discontentment that Shen Yifeng and so on did, they too had already been jolted till they were scared out of their wits.The mythological beast\u2019s flavour from the folklores was, nevertheless, truly\u2026Very unique! And very heavy, ah!Just when everyone had suspected that Shen Yanxiao was incapable of completing the signing of the contract with the Vermillion Bird, that little brat, whom had been practically forgotten along this journey, at this moment, lifted up her own left hand. She opened her little mouth and nipped the forefinger of her left hand.The scarlet blood on Shen Yanxiao\u2019s fingertips coagulated into a blood bead.Everyone who was present all assumed alarmed expressions, for this idiot had unexpectedly understood what the Vermillion Bird had said!People such as Shen Yifeng had their mouths open even more, to the point that it was possible to squeeze an egg into them.Under everyone\u2019s astonished vision, Shen Yanxiao expressionlessly stretched out her hand and dropped down a blood marking between the Vermillion Bird\u2019s eyebrows.In a split second, scarlet red radiances bubbled out from underground, and the vapor that had soared up, in a flash, enveloped the Vermillion Bird and Shen Yanxiao.\u201cI, the Vermillion Bird, am willing to reach an agreement together with thou, and will mutually follow thee in life or death.\u201dThe serious voice had slowly echoed inside the torrid heat cave. The three people\u2019s frame of minds, at this moment, dropped to an all time low.They\u2018d never anticipated that the outcome of this time\u2019s awakening of the Vermillion Bird would unexpectedly be like this. Shen Yanxiao, the person that they\u2019d treated as a laughingstock and a bystander from the start to finish, had unexpectedly gone against everyone\u2019s anticipations, and had obtained the Vermillion Bird!Liked it?

A reddish-flame was raging and combusting above the large bird\u2019s unfolded pair of wings. Those pair of fiery wings that had unfolded practically filled up the broad cave.This was the true body of the Vermillion Bird from the rumours\u2014the mythological beast that controlled fire, and the one that controlled ten thousands of beasts!Beneath the Vermillion Bird, a petite figure stood still.On the small and common face of Shen Yanxiao, there appeared to be something different. Between her eyebrows, a red-coloured flame totem had quietly laid a brand. The vivid and lifelike totem was akin to a raging, combusting flame.The sage silently looked at the scene before him, and a trace of a smile was exposed at the corner of his eyes.At that moment, when Shen Yanxiao had signed the contract with the Vermillion Bird, Shen Yifeng\u2019s heart was like a dying ember. If it was said that he was previously incessantly vexed with regards to this matter, then after he\u2019d personally seen the Vermillion Bird appear in beast form before his eyes, it could be said that the unwillingness in his heart could practically burn everything down.What kind of formidable existence this was, ah!The Vermillion Bird\u2019s formidability made all magical beasts seem far inferior in regards to it. After having personally witnessed the Vermillion Bird\u2019s strength, Shen Yifeng didn\u2019t dare to imagine that someday, in the future, just how was he himself going to look for a magical beast that belonged to him.Having such a formidable Vermillion Bird before his eyes, no matter how much painstaking effort he\u2019d spent, he too wouldn\u2019t be able to find a magical beast that could be compared to even one ten thousandth of the Vermillion Bird.So unwilling! So unwilling, ah!Even if Shen Yifeng were to be even more unwilling, he still couldn\u2019t change today\u2019s facts. Having Shen Jiayi\u2019s precedent placed as it was, and with the Vermillion Bird\u2019s warning resounding at his ears, who would still dare to expose the slightest bit of enmity towards Shen Yanxiao at this very moment.He himself, obviously, was the strongest genius of the Vermillion Bird Clan, so why did the heavens want to tease him like this?!The unwillingness in Shen Yifeng\u2019s heart was still like this. As for Shen Jiawei whom was flinching in the corner, his circumstances were even more terrible, but compared to the unwillingness he had, his heart was actually even more frightened.Previously, the enticement of the Vermillion Bird had been presented to him, and there was Shen Jiayi helping him, so he\u2019d already long forgotten the fear of Shen Yanxiao on that day. However, now, as he saw that petite figure standing below the body of the immensely large Vermillion Bird, the fear that was buried in the depths of his heart was once again evoked.He was scared, scared that Shen Yanxiao whom now possessed the Vermillion Bird would become different compared to the past.There was no one who was clearer than him in regards to the bullying that Shen Jiayi and Shen Jiawei had done to Shen Yanxiao for a long time now. He was afraid Shen Yanxiao would take her revenge, and with the Vermillion Bird\u2019s attitude just now, if Shen Yanxiao gave a command to have him eliminated by the Vermillion Bird\u2026Shen Jiawei almost wanted to cry. If he had known earlier that there\u2019d be a day like this for Shen Yanxiao, even if he had a hundred times the courage he had now, he wouldn\u2019t have gone and provoked this brat. Thinking about it again, he couldn\u2019t help but be even more frightened, for just now, his older sister had derided Shen Yanxiao. If the Vermillion Bird was to take out its anger in regards to this matter on he himself\u2026At this very moment, Shen Jiawei was only thinking of how to reduce his own presence. By all means, he mustn\u2019t let Shen Yanxiao take notice of himself!He was still young, and he still didn\u2019t want to die!\u2026It was very obvious that Shen Jiawei\u2019s worry was unnecessary.After having just recently signing the contract with the Vermillion Bird, a trace of subtle changes occurred within her body. She was very certain that what she\u2019d perceived had come from the Vermillion Bird\u2019s mood. Even if this stinky little bird was to not open its mouth, now she herself was able to know what it was thinking of.Lifting her head, she looked at the huge monster whom was above her head, and the corner of Shen Yanxiao\u2019s mouth perked up in a brilliant smile.Liked it?

This voice was different compared to its puerile voice when it was at its human form. The voice that was transmitted into her mind was clearly an adult male voice, but its voice had the same amount of haughtiness within it.\u201cShen Yanxiao.\u201d\u201cFrom today onwards, I\u2019m here to cover you\u2014there\u2019ll be no one that dares to bully you.\u201d In regards to its new owner, the Vermilion Bird had some thoughts of its own. Previously, that stinky girl had scolded Shen Yanxiao that much and yet, Shen Yanxiao still hadn\u2019t had the slightest response towards that idiot. His master absolutely couldn\u2019t be someone who tried to be on good terms with everyone and allowed them to bully her! No matter how she was previously, someday in the future, he\u2019d certainly teach her how to be a qualified owner, and that she absolutely mustn\u2019t disgrace his dignity as a mythological beast!Shen Yanxiao raised her eyebrows before she even had the time to open her mouth, as the other voice appeared within her mind.\u201cJust relying on yourself, little bird, you still want to cover others?\u2019 Without any prior indication, Xiu\u2019s voice echoed.\u2018You are!\u2019 The voice that the Vermillion Bird was somewhat familiar with had him incessantly flabbergasted, for he\u2019d never before heard a third party\u2019s voice within his own master\u2019s mind. Yet, that sound appeared to have came from an awfully old memory, and within the given time, he was unable to find the owner of the voice.\u2018Who I am isn\u2019t important\u2014you just have to know that it\u2019s good enough that the foresight that you had this time wasn\u2019t wrong.\u2019 Xiu\u2019s voice was still like before, where it was as cold as ice.The Vermillion Bird was somewhat vexed, for after all, what was with this voice\u2019s sudden appearance? In the end, just which bastard was it that was dwelling inside the body of this small master of his?\u2018What kind of person would even unexpectedly not dare to divulge his own identity? Could it be it was just too shameful?\u2019 This was the new master that he\u2019d chosen, and he wouldn\u2019t wish for the master that he\u2019d just contracted with to right away to meet with some kind of mishap.\u2018Hehe, you\u2019re courting death.\u2019 Xiu\u2019s voice was cold to point of freezing.\u201cYou guys had better stop it before you go too far!\u201d The two voices that were residing inside of her head were fighting , and yet in the end, had they or had they not thought about her feelings\u2014the proper owner\u2019s feelings!Shen Yanxiao was entirely helpless, for having Xiu\u2014one whom was indifferent, arrogant and had to serve her\u2014was already enough to have her vexed. Now, came another one who thought of himself as unparalleled in this world\u2014the Vermillion Bird. They\u2019d directly battled against each other inside of her mind, and this tormented her to death!\u201cYou guys had better listen properly! As of now, you all are my possessions, and no matter how capable you are, please do be slightly well-behaved! Or else this young master will knock myself to death, and have the two of you helplessly watch it!\u201d Shen Yanxiao suddenly left, and continued to ignore the two bastards fighting, for it\u2019d only be her that would go crazy. Just who could put up with having Word War 4 happen inside their mind?\u2018You, a human, have unexpectedly dared to threaten me!\u2019 The Vermilion Bird was in a bad mood, for even if she was the master that he\u2019d chosen, this was nothing more than because of his own prior agreement, and only then because he couldn\u2019t help but choose one amongst the four of them. Shen Yanxiao herself simply didn\u2019t have the capability to have him submit cheerfully.\u201cHehe, if you don\u2019t believe me, you can try. I actually want to see how you, the noble mythological beast, the Vermillion Bird, would still be able to mingle within the mythological beasts\u2019 social circle if I was to just die right after having signed a contract with you.\u201d Threaten? Shen Yanxiao had already wanted to beat him up long ago.She could roughly guess the Vermillion Bird\u2019s temper. His arrogance and self-importance were because the mythological beast saw his own dignity to be more, much more, important when compared to his own life. If not, he wouldn\u2019t have guarded a human race\u2019s clan for the past several hundred years just because of an agreement.Although, she was very curious.

As a first-rate mythological beast, it was very confident in itself that each and every generation of his masters had all, in the end, died of old age. There hadn\u2019t be any one whom had been killed halfway through their lives. Protecting his master throughout their whole lives was what had stood for the mythological beast\u2019s dignity, for if it couldn\u2019t even properly protect a human, and this matter were to pass on to the other mythological beasts\u2019 ears, then he\u2019d truly be too embarrassed to continue mingling with the other mythological beasts.It had to be said that the amount of experience that Shen Yanxiao had accumulated from her previous life was extremely plentiful, and dealing with the Vermillion Bird, this kind of \u2018creature\u2019, was nevertheless very easy.As for the other one, Xiu simply hadn\u2019t opened his mouth at all.Immediately after Shen Yanxiao spoke, Xiu could right away guess this little bastard\u2019s plan. After interacting with her for a period of time, Xiu had more or less figured out his current ally. His ally was one hundred percent a little fox\u2014sly and shrewd. Cherishing one\u2019s own life was much more important than anything else, so whoever dared to make a move on her, she\u2019d absolutely pay it back a hundredfold.Let her commit suicide?Let her kill people was more like it.She was clearly using a lie to threaten the proud and arrogant Vermillion Bird. Merely, it was a pity that the Vermillion Bird simply didn\u2019t understand his new master\u2019s temperament at all. As a result\u2026that was a plight of ignorance.The two troubles were temporarily suppressed by Shen Yanxiao\u2019s \u2018threat\u2019. Not long after the inside of her mind had become tranquil, she lifted her eyes and looked at the others who were inside the cave.They\u2019d handled their internal affairs in a hesitating fashion, for what she\u2019d previously displayed was only a taciturn look in front of everyone. After digesting the astonishment inside of their heads, people such as Shen Yifeng, at this moment, looked her with more or less somewhat strange expressions.They were unclear as to whether or not, at this moment, the Shen Yanxiao whom was before their eyes was to be treated as the future clan master, or as what they\u2019d formerly treated her as\u2014an idiot?Before the Vermillion Bird, no one dared to be unbridled\u2014but Shen Yanxiao was an idiot! How could this kind of person become the clan head?Everyone\u2019s state of mind was very complicated, but they didn\u2019t dare to court death before the Vermillion Bird.\u201cCongratulations.\u201d After having Shen Jiayi handed over to the retinues of the Vermillion Bird Clan, the sage walked until he was in front of Shen Yanxiao. From the point when the Vermillion Bird had opened his mouth, until when he\u2019d signed the agreement with Shen Yanxiao, the sage could be said to be the one whom had been the most unperturbed within the entire cave. On his elegant face was a smiling expression that hadn\u2019t changed, and he had an amiable attitude had people couldn\u2019t bear to refuse.\u201cThank you, sage.\u201d Shen Yanxiao\u2019s smile was like a flower as she respectfully stood on ceremony and expressed her thanks to the sage.No matter what, pertaining to the matter of obtaining the Vermillion Bird, the sage hadn\u2019t had a small contribution towards it.However, a simple thing like expressing her thanks like this nevertheless left a few people from the Vermillion Bird Clan within the cave draw in a deep breath in shock!They uniformly looked towards Shen Yanxiao\u2019s\u2014that pair of clear, glittering eyes\u2014and found it hard to believe. They rubbed and rubbed their eyes.Worn on that little girl\u2019s face was a ceremonial smiling expression, and her clear eyes had long ago lost that ignorant look of their former days. The expression of her thanks had a very articulate pronunciation, and carried a trace of puerile voice that didn\u2019t come from age.The little girl that stood before them was evidently, and precisely, an ordinary child that couldn\u2019t be even more ordinary\u2014there wasn\u2019t even a tiny bit of the shadow of her previous idiocy.Everyone had begun to doubt themselves on whether or not they themselves were hallucinating, for Shen Yanxiao had been insane and foolish for thirteen years in the Vermillion Bird Clan\u2014so how had she, in the time it took to blink, unexpectedly turned into an ordinary person?!Even the sage\u2019s face showed a trace of astonishment that he didn\u2019t have time to cover it up. He astonishingly looked at the little girl who was completely different compared to the past. If it wasn\u2019t that Shen Yanxiao had, in the past, always remained in his line of sight, he seriously would\u2019ve thought that this little bastard before his eyes had swapped places with someone else.Just how had an idiot that was ridiculed by the common person immediately changed into an ordinary person, whom had intelligence in her eyes\u2014in only the time it takes one to wink?Liked it?

Not knowing what to do, she nibbled on her lips, before saying, \u201cHave I frightened the sage? I\u2019m truly sorry, for I too don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. Just now, when I was signing the agreement, with the Vermillion Bird, the inside of my brain suddenly become much more clear-headed. I remember that I was once akin to an idiot, but unknowingly, with what\u2019s just happened, it seems that I\u2019ve become normal.\u201dWith her reserved, little hands of grasped onto her clothes\u2019 fringes, Shen Yanxiao seemingly appeared as if she were really a sincere little girl, who was somewhat at her wit\u2019s end.The sage promptly put away the astonishment that was on his face, but his mind was nevertheless pondering over this freakish matter.He was very clear about Shen Yanxiao\u2019s circumstances\u2014a congenital deficiency, where she had shortcoming of wisdom. A certain person had previously inquired to him about Shen Yanxiao\u2019s circumstances many times within these few years, and he\u2019d long already become certain that Shen Yanxiao\u2019s wisdom was unable to reinstated. However, just how, she\u2019d suddenly become okay?Could it be that all of this was because of the Vermillion Bird?It had already been a century since a mythological beast had appeared at this world. Regarding every single piece of information about the mythological beasts, they were all blockaded by each and every clan. Although there was some information about the mythological beasts within the God\u2019s Domain, it nevertheless wasn\u2019t well-rounded at all. The sage could only treat the reinstatement of Shen Yanxiao\u2019s wisdom as the Vermillion Bird\u2019s contribution.\u201cVery good, it\u2019s indeed very good like this. I believe that your family will certainly be happy for you.\u201d The sage gently lifted his hand and wanted to rub Shen Yanxiao\u2019s head.However, a bunch of flames nevertheless coalesced, impolitely forcing his palm open.Along with the path of flame soaring, the Vermillion Bird had once again changed its enormous body out of its beast form, and transformed into the appearance of a three to four year old child.\u201cDon\u2019t have an itchy hand.\u201d The Vermilion Bird snorted as he spoke.He wasn\u2019t fond of the human race. Accepting a master was already like tackling a difficult job for him, and he certainly didn\u2019t want the smell of another of the human race on his little master\u2019s body.The sage broke into laughter as he withdrew his hand.At this point, the conversation between Shen Yanxiao and the sage, without a word missing, had fallen onto the ears of the people from the Vermillion Bird Clan.Shen Yifeng only felt the suffering of an enormous blow\u2014a blow that struck him straight into unconsciousness.The disgrace of the Vermillion Bird Clan had unexpectedly become smart!!Looking at the Vermillion Bird whom was standing at Shen Yanxiao\u2019s side, an enormous amount of panic was birthed inside Shen Yifeng\u2019s heart.He\u2019d never regarded Shen Yanxiao as his own rival in inheriting the position of the clan leader, for she was nothing more than an idiotic trash who, nevertheless, couldn\u2019t cultivate Dou Qi and magic. She didn\u2019t have parents behind her back to support her either, and she wasn\u2019t even Shen Feng\u2019s favourite. His mind had never been placed onto the matter of dealing with Shen Yanxiao. Even the two siblings that frequently bullied Shen Yanxiao were merely too used to using Shen Yanxiao as their entertainment, and simply hadn\u2019t regarded her as their rivals.However, who could\u2019ve known that it was precisely this idiot whom had been ignored and disregarded by everyone else like this, who\u2019d unexpectedly have this kind of world-changing change within a single day.At first, she\u2019d obtained the Vermillion Bird\u2019s good graces, and then with the help of the Vermillion Bird\u2019s strength, she\u2019d regained the wisdom of an ordinary person.Thus, from the most unremarkable disciple of the Vermillion Bird Clan, Shen Yanxiao had unexpectedly became the most probable person to inherit the position of the Vermillion Bird Clan\u2019s clan leader in one leap!Recalling the importance Shen Feng had attached to the Vermillion Bird, and the rumor about the sentence, \u2018Obtain the Vermillion Bird, become the clan leader,\u2019 Shen Yifeng felt shivers all over, even though he wasn\u2019t cold.Even if Shen Feng were to dislike Shen Yanxiao, the her now had already reinstated her full awareness, and had, even more, obtained the Vermillion Bird. Shen Feng would certainly attach extreme importance to her, for within the Vermillion Bird Clan, there was still one person who\u2019d receive an extreme amount of importance from Shen Feng\u2014Shen Siyu!It had to be known that even Shen Jiayi had secretly and incessantly hated Shen Siyu for treating Shen Yanxiao well!Was the Vermillion Bird Clan seriously undergoing a change?Liked it?

As he sat in the main seat, a little bit of nervousness was shown on his dignified face.\u201cWhat have the people who were sent to the city gates said? They still haven\u2019t spotted the reflection of the group of carriages?\u201d Shen Feng wrinkled his eyebrows as he asked Shen Ling who was standing at his side.As early as two days ago, they\u2019d already received the information that had been sent from the God\u2019s Domain, that the troops that had proceeded towards the lava valley were already returning. Apart from this spatter of brief news, the God\u2019s Envoys from the God\u2019s Domain simply hadn\u2019t leaked out any more information. For these two days, the entire Vermillion Bird Clan had all appeared to be somewhat unable to sit or stand still out of nervousness.Everyone was very clear that, so long as the sage was successful in rousing the Vermillion Bird, among the four youngsters that had left for the lava valley, there\u2019d certainly be one that had signed the contract with the Vermillion Bird.Right now, they were very nervous, for after all, no one knew whether or not the sage had been successful in rousing the Vermillion Bird.After all, the Vermillion Bird had already been laying dormant for a century, so no one had a hundred percent certainty in it.After receiving the news from the God\u2019s Domain, Shen Feng had at once dispatched people to watch over the city gate around the clock, in order to ensure that they were capable of relaying the news the first moment they spotted the troops\u2019 return.It had already been more than a century. It had already been more than a century since the Vermillion Bird Clan had lost the Vermilion Bird, and after a century, they\u2019d once again possess the possibility to see the Vermillion Bird\u2014which in regard to the entire clan, was extremely important.The wait, for every minute and every second that passed, seemed to be drawn out and endless.Shen Ling said, \u201cThere still hasn\u2019t been any news, but according to the estimation of their time, they ought to be quickly returning already. Father, you don\u2019t have to be excessively anxious, for Heaven will definitely assist the Vermillion Bird Clan, and this trip was certainly bound to achieve immediate victory.\u201dShen Feng sighed, he was already more than half a century old. If this time they weren\u2019t able to roused the Vermillion Bird, then it was very likely that, for the rest of his life, he\u2019d have no opportunity to see the Vermillion Bird again.The main room was a place of extreme quiet, and everyone was incessantly anxious like Shen Feng in their hearts.With large strides, the retinue with a hastened expression rushed into the main room.Shen Ling could right away recognise with a single glance that this person was indeed the clan servant that he\u2019d dispatched to the city hall to watch over it.\u201cInformation for the clan head! They\u2019ve returned! Our clan\u2019s carriages have returned!\u201d The retinue excitedly opened his mouth.Shen Feng\u2019s expression jolted, and both of his hands were somewhat trembling as they held onto the chair\u2019s armrests.\u201cQuick! Quickly follow me to meet the sage!\u201d The excited voice had somewhat changed pitch. Shen Feng impatiently got up and called for the others that were within the main room to hurry over to the entrance of the Vermillion Bird Clan.Before the entrance, seven to eight carriages had uniformly halted at the doorway. The sage had already taken the lead, and had stepped out of the carriage with a lukewarm smiling expression on his face. Shen Feng rashly lead everyone out of the entrance and welcomed the sage.\u201cSage, thank you for troubling yourself on this trip! Please, do enter and rest!\u201d Shen Feng after all was still earnest, for he knew that even if it had reached this point, he still had to maintain his respect towards the sage.\u201cLuckily, there was no disgrace brought to the mission, therefore congratulations to you senior. \u201c The sage faintly smiled, and announced the good news that everyone had long been waiting for.The Vermillion Bird had indeed been roused!After all of the younger generations of the Vermillion Bird Clan that were on the scene heard this news, they drew in a breath of cold air. The Vermillion Bird, to them, was indeed extremely important, and anyone else would also be unable to understand their longing for the Vermillion Bird. The pleasant surprise was crammed inside everyone\u2019s hearts, and in order not to be lacking in manners before the sage, they could only resist the ecstasy that was on their face with great difficulty. However, the hurried and, with bated breath, had already sold their hearts out.In their lives, they\u2019d unexpectedly, truly be able to see the Vermillion Bird!This matter was one that many clan members yearned for even in their dreams!Shen Feng almost cried tears of joy. As he was somewhat choked with sobs, he nodded his head and, with a blazing gaze, walked towards the few carriages that were behind the sage.Liked it?

That person, under the Vermillion Bird\u2019s aid, would once again bring the Vermillion Bird Clan back to the summit!Shen Duan\u2019s sight was rigidly locked onto the first carriage behind the sage. He knew that his own son was, at this moment, sitting inside. When the sage had announced the news that the Vermillion Bird was roused, Shen Duan had nearly passed out from happiness. Anyone else would also know that, within the Vermillion Bird Clan right now, his own son, Shen Yifeng, had received the most importance. Moreover, within this party of four, Shen Yifeng\u2019s strength was the strongest.He could practically be certain that his own son had been successful in signing the contract with the Vermillion Bird!His own son! His own son would immediately become the future clan leader of the Vermillion Bird Clan! As for him, he too would become an elder within the Vermillion Bird Clan, moreover, the one that received the most respect from the people!Shen Duan\u2019s heart was both happy and emotionally moved. He impatiently wanted to urge his son to hurriedly get out and let him have a good look at the Vermillion Bird\u2019s real face in order to increase his knowledge.Compared to Shen Duan\u2019s ecstasy, Shen Yue\u2019s face couldn\u2019t be counted as too happy at all. Shen Yue originally hadn\u2019t carried many expectations towards his children. It was just that Shen Duan and he had always been inharmonious. Now that Shen Yifeng had obtained the Vermillion Bird, Shen Duan would inevitably deliberately make things difficult on himself everywhere.At this moment, the happiness caused by the Vermillion Bird\u2019s return was simply unable to cause Shen Yue to rejoice.What was he to complain about since the person that had obtained the Vermillion Bird wasn\u2019t one of his children.Very soon, Shen Yifeng walked out from within the carriage. The him that had just recently walked out from the carriage immediately came into contact with a dozen or more pairs of blazing eyes.The next second, he quickly lowered his head and didn\u2019t dare to look up at the pair after pair of eyes which were brimming with expectation.Shen Yifeng\u2019s odd expression had people such as Shen Feng very baffled. Although Shen Yifeng\u2019s temper was a little calm, for the him that had obtained the Vermillion Bird, it\u2019d be simply impossible for him to put on this kind of response. This kind of evading their eyesight had everyone\u2019s hearts feel a bad premonition.\u201cYifeng, you can be counted to have returned however, where is the Vermillion Bird? Why didn\u2019t it follow you by your side? Could it be that you have him withdrawn right now? Hehe, this kid, quickly summon the Vermillion Bird so that your grandfather can take a look at it.\u201d Shen Duan had long ago flooded his mind with ecstasy, to the point that he was muddle-headed, and had simply never thought that his own son would be unable to obtain the Vermillion Bird\u2019s good graces. Therefore, he simply didn\u2019t take note of Shen Yifeng\u2019s unusual behaviour. Instead, a smiling expression was on his face as he urged Shen Yifeng to summon the Vermillion Bird.Facing his father\u2019s fervent attitude, Shen Yifeng was even more hard pressed. On that outstanding handsome face, nevertheless hung a facial expression that was even more bitter than if it were compared to a bitter gourd.\u201cI\u2026\u201d Shen Yifeng truly didn\u2019t know just how he was going to explain this to everyone, for they\u2019d definitely had their hopes piled on him, but he\u2026That expression of Shen Yifeng holding something back finally attracted Shen Duan\u2019s attention. Looking at Shen Yifeng\u2019s evasive sight, an inauspicious premonition was suddenly raised in Shen Duan\u2019s heart.\u201cYifeng, could it be that you didn\u2019t obtain the Vermillion Bird\u2026?\u201d Shen Duan had himself nearly jumping in fright by his own way of thinking. However, before he\u2019d even finished what he was saying, Shen Yifeng had quickly nodded his head and turned his face to the side.A basin of cold water fell straight onto his face and put out Shen Duan\u2019s heart that had been in ecstasy.How could this be?! His son was the most outstanding one amongst the third generation of the Vermillion Bird Clan, so how could it be that he hadn\u2019t received the Vermillion Bird\u2019s good graces? How could he have lost to those two children of Shen Yue\u2019s! As for what sort of people Shen Jiayi and Shen Jiawei were, he himself was very clear.

During the time where Shen Duan had been in great delight, Shen Yue had secretly been sullen, but at the time where Shen Duan was in his current depressed state of mind, Shen Yue had nevertheless already become unable to conceal his smiling expression that was peeking out of the corner of his mouth.What was this called?It was called a stroke of good fortune!Shen Yue wanted to howl with laughter at this time, because Shen Duan had certainly lost face greatly, for everyone had all already believed that the winner this time would certainly, without a doubt, be Shen Yifeng. The result, however, had ended with him becoming a big joke! Shen Yifeng\u2019s defeat meant that his children had hope!This time, a total of four people had gone, and his children had taken two of the spots. With Shen Yifeng\u2019s defeat and the no-need-to-even-consider-idiot, Shen Yanxiao, it was a fact that the Vermilion Bird would have to pick from his children!No matter whether the Vermillion Bird had selected Shen Jiayi or Shen Jiawei, to Shen Yue, it was still a joy from heaven!In lives, there would be up and downs. After having been suppressed by Shen Duan for how many years, he\u2019d finally seen the light of the sun!With great difficulty, Shen Yue resisted the happiness in his heart. With a pretense, he walked until he was standing before Shen Duan. Patting Shen Duan\u2019s shoulder, he insincerely comforted him and said, \u201cSecond brother, don\u2019t feel too sad that Yifeng didn\u2019t obtain this good fortune. However, wouldn\u2019t it be the same for our Vermillion Bird Clan no matter who obtained the Vermillion Bird? So long as the whole clan is well, wouldn\u2019t it be alright?\u201dShen Duan glared ferociously at Shen Yue.While Shen Yue was crying crocodile tears, don\u2019t think that Shen Duan didn\u2019t know just what Shen Yue was thinking in his mind. In the end, Shen Duan truly didn\u2019t know just what kind of problem had happened during this trip for his own family\u2019s outstanding son to unexpectedly not be chosen by the Vermillion Bird. For no reason, those two brats of Shen Yue\u2019s had gotten it cheap.\u201cWell said, they\u2019re all children of the Vermillion Bird Clan, and whoever has obtained the Vermillion Bird is the same as everyone else.\u201d Shen Feng, whom was nearby, said. Shen Yifeng\u2019s defeat had truly gone against his expectations, but since the sage had congratulated him, then this matter naturally wouldn\u2019t be a problem. He certainly wouldn\u2019t want to wait and watch as his two children became a disgrace because of this matter in front of the sage.\u201cYes.\u201d Shen Duan ground his teeth and swallowed his unwillingness back into his heart.After transforming his depression from just now into a closely-packed smiling expression, Shen Yue looked back towards the carriages that his children had ridden within.However, after they saw Shen Jiayi, whom was riddled with scars and was supported by the retinue as she exited the carriage, Shen Yue\u2019s complexion indeed turned somewhat truly ugly.What was going on? Why was his perfectly alright daughter unexpectedly brought back with injuries all over her body? Just looking at Shen Jiayi\u2019s miserable appearance, Shen Yue right away knew that his own daughter hadn\u2019t obtained the Vermillion Bird\u2019s good graces.If that was so, then was it Jiawei?Compared to his daughter, Shen Yue hoped even more that his son would obtain the Vermillion Bird. After all, Shen Jiayi was a girl and, someday in the future, would inevitably have to be married off.Shen Yue first had people arrange a place for Shen Jiayi to rest. Afterwards, he impatiently stood at the doorway, waiting for his son to emerge.As for Shen Duan and Shen Yifeng, he had them taken as far away as possible, for his son would right away become the heir of the Vermillion Bird Clan, and as a matter of fact, he wanted to see what kind of trouble this pair of hypocritical father and son duo could still make out of nothing.He\u2019d certainly have Shen Duan properly repay these few years to him\u2026Before Shen Yue\u2019s beautiful dream had yet to finish, Shen Jiawei\u2019s form as he emerged smashed his beautiful dreamShen Jiawei too was supported by the retinue as he walked out of the carriage, and his body was filled with bruises. He simply wasn\u2019t any better compared to Shen Jiayi whom had just recently gotten off!!From the successive generations of owners of the Vermillion Bird, there hadn\u2019t been anyone that had returned home and been riddled with scars after having finishing signing the contract.Liked it?

If that was so\u2026Everyone\u2019s gazes looked without any delusions at the second-to-last carriage, everyone was clearly aware of who was currently sitting inside of the carriage.Could it be that\u2026?!\u2026Shen Yanxiao was dilly dallying inside of the carriage, and wasn\u2019t in a rush to get off. It wasn\u2019t that she didn\u2019t want to perceive the feeling of having peace of mind from Mother Earth, but rather\u2026\u201cBlegh!\u201d The Vermillion Bird, even with its extreme arrogance, was deathly pale in the face, and was holding onto a cask as he incessantly vomited.Who could\u2019ve expected the grand mythological beast, the Vermillion Bird, to unexpectedly get \u2018carsick\u2019!After hastening along in their journey for a few days, starting from the point where the Vermillion Bird had gotten onto the carriage, its complexion had immediately begun to pale and its palms had begun to sweat. Not long after that, it began to madly throw up. What made Shen Yanxiao even more speechless, was that this self-important little bird unexpectedly wasn\u2019t willing to be withdrawn into her body. After a demonic beast had signed the contract with its master, it could have its body turn into spiritual power and stay within its owner\u2019s body. Logically speaking, since the Vermillion Bird was currently unwell, with the bumpiness of the carriage, it ought to obediently stay within her body.However, this bastard was very stubborn. The reason for selecting Shen Yanxiao was because it\u2019d had no choice but to choose someone, and Shen Yanxiao simply hadn\u2019t had the strength to make him submit cheerfully. Wanting him to stay inside that kind of body, of a puny human, even if he were to be beaten to death, he\u2019d still be unwilling to.Having no other alternative, the Vermillion Bird just vomited throughout the journey back to the Vermillion Bird Clan.As of now, on that small, refined face, there wasn\u2019t even half of it\u2019s previous haughtiness. On that face that was completely lacking colour, that pair of scarlet-coloured pupils carried a layer of steam. Looking at that particularly miserable look, could cause the people who\u2019d looked at before fall in love with it dearly.If one were to use the words of the 24th century to describe it, then the Vermillion Bird, at this very moment, could be said to be\u2026So moe!Shen Yanxiao naturally wouldn\u2019t really have the Vermillion Bird treated like a cute pet to be locked away and kept, for she indeed clearly remembered the previous scene where the Vermillion Bird had nearly killed Shen Jiayi, and had done it without even blinking. The current him was adorable simply because of the reason that he\u2019d been carsick.If she could, Shen Yanxiao would\u2019ve wanted to slyly look upwards and smile.You too would have a day like this!\u201cHey! Have you finishing throwing up yet? We\u2019ve arrived.\u201d Shen Yanxiao supported her chin. She didn\u2019t mind having the people who were outside wait for another while, but she nevertheless didn\u2019t want stay within this carriage together with this pile of vomit!\u201cYou don\u2019t say\u2026 so many\u2026if you want to get off\u2026then get off\u2026After I sit for\u2026will\u2026will die, ah\u2026\u201d The Vermillion Bird was awfully inclined to valiantly have this new master of his kicked out of the carriage, but with the current circumstances he was in right now, he was disinclined to even make a slight movement with his finger.That damned carriage, for the rest of its lifetime, he didn\u2019t want to sit on it anymore! The next time, he\u2019d absolutely fly himself over here!Shen Yanxiao\u2019s mouth twitched. After briefly saying a few words to the extremely deferential retinue who was to the side, she walked out of the carriage first.When she extended her head outward from the carriage, a dozen or more pairs of extremely complicated looks had immediately, earth-shatteringly, smashed over.Shen Yanxiao raised her eyebrows. Just why were all of these people\u2019s appearance as if they\u2019d met a ghost?Shen Feng astonishingly looked at that little face that he was familiar with, and yet that wasn\u2019t familiar to him. Although Shen Yanxiao didn\u2019t command much importance inside of the Vermillion Bird Clan, it too was unlikely of him to go as for as to even not remember what sort of appearance his granddaughter had grown to. That little face of hers still looked as mediocre as usual, but that ignorance of her former days, in her eyes at this moment, had nevertheless carried a trace of quick-wittiness. The corner of her rosy mouth was slightly raised. Although she couldn\u2019t count as pretty, it also nevertheless had people thinking that there was a trace of adorableness.Liked it?

They looked at Shen Yanxiao and astonishingly discovered that there was no longer that former idiotic face that completely lacked any facial expression and that had only known how to laugh foolishly. This little girl in front of them quietly stood beside the carriage. Within those smiling eyes, was a trace of intelligence. Those big black eyes of hers suspiciously swept past each and every one of their bodies.What had made them most astonished was indeed that flame imprint between her eyebrows.Amongst the ancient texts of the Vermillion Bird Clan, there had been records included that stated that for every single person whom had signed the agreement with the Vermillion Bird, they\u2019d have a flame imprint appear between their eyebrows, and that was proof of that person signing the contract with the Vermillion Bird.Previously, Shen Yue and Shen Duan were all too confident in themselves, and simply hadn\u2019t taken note of this, or thought to observe their own children on whether or not they had this flame imprint between their eyebrows. They\u2019d made a joke out of themselves, and made themselves pointlessly happy. It was, after all, a record from at least a hundred years ago, and so anyone would dare not to be certain of its authenticity as they hadn\u2019t seen that flame imprint before.However, once Shen Yanxiao appeared before them, they realized just how ridiculous their own way of thinking was. That flame imprint was bewitching, and at first glance, had immediately attracted everyone\u2019s attention.The Vermillion Bird had really chosen Shen Yanxiao as its master!In everyone\u2019s hearts, they\u2019d all reached this kind of conclusion that had appeared before their eyes. Even if they were unwilling to believe it, the imprint between Shen Yanxiao\u2019s eyebrows nevertheless truly existed.Shen Yue and Shen Duan\u2019s complexion was as dark as the bottom of a pan, for their own families\u2019 outstanding children had unexpectedly lost to an idiot like this. Even if they were to be beaten to death, they too would never have never thought that this would happen. Or else, they wouldn\u2019t have allowed Shen Feng to squeeze Shen Yanxiao into this troop.Now, everything was already all too late. Since the Vermillion Bird had recognised a master, they were already powerless to redeem the situation.\u201cGrandfather, granddaughter has lived up to your expectations, and has brought the Vermillion Bird back.\u201d Shen Yanxiao faintly smiled, and magnanimously walked until she was before Shen Feng whom was staring blankly, and then with incomparable cuteness, said to him.\u201c\u2026\u201d Every Vermillion Bird Clan member that was present was dumbstruck.Were they hallucinating? That idiot that couldn\u2019t even make clear of what others had said was unexpectedly able to be orderly and rational like this as she opened her mouth to speak!!As early as Shen Yanxiao had appeared, Shen Feng had immediately discovered the change in his granddaughter, but when Shen Yanxiao had cutely called him, \u201cgrandfather\u201d, Shen Feng had inevitably remained blank for a moment.Since she was young, the number of times that Shen Yanxiao had met Shen Feng hadn\u2019t been a lot. Even if she were to occasionally see him, she\u2019d hide in a corner and wouldn\u2019t say a word. It could be said that, even after Shen Yanxiao had grown up to be her current, she still hadn\u2019t said a single word to Shen Feng.As for today, the moment she\u2019d opened her mouth, it had right away set off a burst of tides in everyone\u2019s mind.Where\u2019d the idiot that everyone agreed on go? What was the matter with this eloquent and fluent speaking little girl? Where had their family\u2019s idiotic seventh young lady gone?Although Shen Feng didn\u2019t know how Shen Yanxiao had suddenly become okay, not only was Shen Yanxiao after all his granddaughter, but she\u2019d even brought back the Vermillion Bird. How could he not be happy?\u201cIt\u2019s good that you\u2019ve returned. It\u2019s good that you have returned!\u201d Shen Feng was somewhat emotionally moved as he looked at Shen Yanxiao. However, he couldn\u2019t help but to open his mouth and ask,\u201cXiaoxiao, why is it that you\u2019ve suddenly\u2026\u201dShen Yanxiao wittily blinked her eyes, touched the tip of her nose, and then smiled as she said, \u201cGrandfather, you should be asking me why I\u2019m suddenly okay, right? In fact, I too don\u2019t know the reason; only that after I signed the contract with the Vermilion Bird, it was as if my entire self became clear-headed.\u201dLiked it?

Even Shen Feng wouldn\u2019t have a very high understanding of the Vermillion Bird, he only knew that the Vermillion Bird possessed remarkable abilities. Shen Yanxiao had long ago made proper preparations, and no matter who it was that came to ask her why she was suddenly intelligent, she\u2019d without exception just use the Vermillion Bird to beat around the bush.Who would dare to call this reasoning into question? If they had the capabilities, they themselves could go and seek confirmation from that extremely conceited, stinky little bird!\u201cGood, good\u2026this is truly very good.\u201d Shen Feng excitedly patted Shen Yanxiao\u2019s shoulder, and as he gazed the flame imprint in between Shen Yanxiao\u2019s eyebrows, he knew right away that what Shen Yanxiao had said was all true.These two simultaneous happy events in the clan, the Vermillion Bird\u2019s return and Shen Yanxiao\u2019s clear-headedness, had Shen Feng\u2019s dignified face let out an enormous smile. He immediately called for everyone to return to the mansion.However, Shen Yanxiao nevertheless pulled Shen Feng\u2019s sleeve.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d When confronting his suddenly normal granddaughter, Shen Feng\u2019s bearing was somewhat at a complete loss.Shen Yanxiao looked towards her own carriage, somewhat vexed, and said, \u201cGrandfather, the Vermillion Bird is still in the carriage.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Shen Feng stared foolishly at that carriage that was halted at his clan\u2019s entrance with a blank look, while within his mind were unbounded echoes of what Shen Yanxiao had previously said.The Vermillion Bird\u2026 was just on that carriage!!The old man who\u2019d aged more than half a century suddenly trembled all over and, particularly nervously, examined whether his clothes were neat or not.Shen Yue and Shen Duan\u2019s eyes were itching even more as they stuck to the carriage.Everyone just stood like this before the huge entrance, and quietly waited for the Vermillion Bird to appear. There wasn\u2019t one that dared to grumble even a single word of grievance.It was only when the top of their heads were all somewhat emitting heat from basking in the scorching sun, that there was finally some movement in the carriage.A delicate, small hand stretched out from the carriage, and everyone held their breaths.A rather conspicuous pale little face suddenly appeared out from the carriage\u2019s entrance, and everyone immediately opened their eyes wideThis\u2026was the Vermillion Bird?Everyone stupidly looked at that somewhat wan little face. Although that little face was unusually charming, and had distantly exceeded everyone\u2019s esthetic concept, no one would\u2019ve thought that their own clan\u2019s incomparably formidable mythological beast would unexpectedly appear with the appearance of a three to four years old child.Shen Feng\u2019s voice was as if it was choked. He stared at the Vermillion Bird\u2019s scarlet red eyes, and inwardly said, \u2018Within the ancient text of the Vermillion Bird Clan, there was definitely a record that, after the Vermillion Bird had transformed into the shape of a human, its pair of eyes would indeed be scarlet-red colour, but\u2026Why is it that he\u2019d be a three to four years old child, ah!!\u2019The Vermillion Bird\u2019s figure had distantly exceeded everyone\u2019s expectations, and one could only see that, as they stood before the huge entrance of the Vermillion Bird Clan, everyone of the Vermillion Bird Clan were as if they were motionless\u2014as if they\u2019d been petrified and were nailed down to their original place.The retinue that closely followed at the Vermillion Bird\u2019s side prudently supported the Vermillion Bird down the carriage. The previous him that was cold and indifferent to Shen Yanxiao had became extremely deferential to Shen Yanxiao, and didn\u2019t even dare to make a panting sound after what he\u2019d experienced the matter at the lava valley.The Vermillion Bird simply didn\u2019t take note of a certain person\u2019s flabbergasted looks. He nipped his lip, and walked out of the carriage. Combined with his pale complexion, that small body of his appeared to be exceptionally delicate.Was this truly the mythological beast, the protector of their clan? This form was unavoidably \u2026a little bit too cute!! Everyone from the Vermillion Bird Clan couldn\u2019t help but inwardly mutter, for they\u2019d previously thought of all kind of forms that the Vermillion Bird would be in, from a valiant beast form to a domineering human form, but no one could\u2019ve guessed that the Vermillion Bird would unexpectedly be so\u2026cute?!Everyone\u2019s frame of mind was at a loss.The Vermillion Bird was now very angry, for he himself, the grand mythological beast, had unexpectedly even had to have a petty and lowly human lend an arm to support him in order to get down from the carriage. It was truly humiliating!Under the shame and resentfulness, the Vermillion Bird angrily stared at those few carriages that were parked before the entrance of the Vermillion Bird Clan. His very small hand suddenly was brandished. A path blazing flame was then immediately sent out from the hollow of his palm and streaked across through the air. Before everyone had the time to react to it, the flickering flame in the wind had thrown itself at the eight carriages.Liked it?

In the time it took to blink, those few extravagant carriages had immediately turned into a pile of ashes!Witnessing this astonishing scene, in a flash, everyone from the Vermillion Bird Clan swallowed down their way of thinking into their belly.\u2026Within the main room of the Vermillion Bird Clan, Shen Feng was grinning from ear to ear as he looked at Shen Yanxiao who\u2019d taken a seat inside the main room for the first time.As for the Vermillion Bird, after having suffered torment along the whole journey, he who\u2019d just recently entered the entrance of the Vermillion Bird Clan, had right away been brought to Shen Yanxiao\u2019s room to rest. Although Shen Feng wanted to get close to the Vermillion Bird, the Vermillion Bird had already opened his mouth, so how was there any margin to maneuver for him.As of now, he could only be inwardly happy with seeing Shen Yanxiao whom was already the master of the Vermillion BirdShen Yanxiao however, was also clever. Just as she\u2019d returned to the main room, she\u2019d right away told the matters about the lava valley to Shen Feng. Shen Feng repeatedly nodded, and laughed heartily as he listened. However, Shen Duan and Shen Yue whom were to the side, had complexions that were unsightly to the extreme.This one happy occasion that should\u2019ve been perfectly alright for them, was unexpectedly gotten for cheap by this idiot. Just thinking about this one thing made the two of them want to spit blood out of depression.\u201cI believe that your parents in heaven would feel gratified for everything about you now.\u201d Shen Feng looked at Shen Yanxiao, the inside of his eyes spreading a genuinely smiling expression.Towards those so-called parents that she had no impression of, Shen Yanxiao only feigned, and cutely nodded her head.\u201cSince you\u2019ve signed the contract with the Vermillion Bird, then, in the following days, you mustn\u2019t be that sort of idiot like in the past.\u201d Shen Feng said.Shen Feng\u2019s words had people such as Shen Duan alarmed from head to toeObtain the Vermillion Bird, become the clan leader.Was it possible that Shen Feng was truly planning to have Shen Yanxiao inherit the position of the Vermillion Bird Clan\u2019s clan leader? Even if Shen Yanxiao had suddenly recovered to normal, her nature was still a trash that couldn\u2019t cultivate Dou Qi and magic! Even if there were the Vermillion Bird helping her, so what? Her own strength fell short with unprecedented brutality. Once there was someone that had the intention to look for an opportunity to make a move, it was very likely that she wouldn\u2019t even have the capability to protect herself.\u201cSometime, I\u2019ll have people making arrangements for you to come into contact with some things that are important among the clan. You have to be diligent when learning them, and you mustn\u2019t make grandfather disappointed.\u201d With concern and care, Shen Feng told Shen Yanxiao.Come into contact with the clan\u2019s important things? Shen Feng\u2019s words had people like Shen Duan have their inner hearts\u2019s alarm bell greatly alarmed. It was evident that Shen Feng was planning to treat Shen Yanxiao as the next clan leader, and that he was going to nurture her.Just what kind of joke was this!!\u201cFather! Xiaoxiao is still young. Moreover, her physique has always been poor. Although, she\u2019s obtained the Vermillion Bird now, father, the disciples of the other four clans certainly aren\u2019t to be trifled with. According to what I know, amongst this generation of the Qilin Clan, Qi Xia is precisely a youngster whom has incomprehensible strength. Moreover, since the sage was able to rouse the Vermillion Bird for our Vermillion Bird Clan, it\u2019s hard to say that the sage won\u2019t go to the other big clans to rouse their mythological beasts. The 5 big mythological beasts originally all had equivalent strengths, and when they mutually contend against one another, it all depends on how high their own masters\u2019 strengths is. Xiaoxiao is unsuitable of cultivating Dou Qi and magic. I\u2019m afraid that someday in the future\u2026\u201d Deeply worried, Shen Duan opened his mouth and spoke.Shen Yanxiao owning the Vermillion Bird was already a foregone conclusion. However, even if she was no longer an idiot, in the end, she was still trash. With her current physique, she simply wasn\u2019t suited to take over the Vermillion Bird Clan\u2019s clan leader position. At most, she could only be considered to be the Vermillion Bird\u2019s accessory. As for a confrontation between the big 5 clans, their clan leader\u2019s own personal strength was what was most cared about.Shen Feng frowned, for what Shen Duan had said was reasonable.Liked it?

Having her undertake so many things so fast\u2026 I\u2019m afraid that she isn\u2019t too suitable. Why don\u2019t we allow the other disciples in our clan to assist her a little bit? It\u2019d also be good to allow her to have some time to train.\u201d Shen Yue immediately accorded. Although he and Shen Duan were on bad terms, their thoughts right now were the same.Shen Yanxiao was merely an accessory of the Vermillion Bird, her personal strength was just too miserable. Perhaps this was a good thing when talking about them. Even if they\u2019d been unable to obtain the Vermillion Bird, their children had nevertheless had the chance to to succeed the Vermillion Bird Clan. So long as their own children were sufficiently formidable, and were able to withstand the clan leaders of the other 4 large clans, then Shen Yanxiao would only need to preserve the Vermillion Bird, and have the Vermillion Bird in order to deal with the other 4 large clans\u2019 mythological beasts\u2014just that would be sufficient already.Rather than saying that Shen Yanxiao was the Vermillion Bird\u2019s master, it\u2019d actually be better to say that she was acting as the Vermillion Bird\u2019s vessel.Trash is precisely a that: trash. Even if she\u2019d obtained the Vermillion Bird, so what? Her own strength was so lacking that she simply didn\u2019t deserve the clan leader position.Shen Yanxiao, whom was to the side, was still listening. Towards these two elders of hers that seemed to have good intentions, she was truly sneering in her heart.They were truly being benevolent! If she\u2019d been unable to guess the subtle intentions on their minds, then she\u2019d have truly lived in vain for her entire previous life. They were simply planning to have her become the Vermillion Bird Clan\u2019s puppet in order to assist their own children\u2019s chances to ascend to the position of clan leader.The reason why they\u2019d dared to be unbridled was because one of them, Shen Yanxiao\u2019s strength, was indeed lacking, and because it\u2019d be hard for her to withstand the other four clan leaders. The second reason was that Shen Yanxiao had lost both her parents, and she simply didn\u2019t have anyone to rely on behind her back.Were they truly treating her as a pushover? Did they truly think that she was easy to bully? Shen Yanxiao inwardly stored Shen Yue and Shen Duan\u2019s intentions in her heart; sooner or later, she\u2019d have them pay her back in full.Everyone was waiting for Shen Feng\u2019s decision. Shen Duan and Shen Yue were nervous, because they knew that their own father had previously never been close with Shen Yanxiao. Moreover, although what they\u2019d just said was partially selfish, it was nevertheless a fact still.How could a piece of trash possibly take the position of clan leader?Shen Feng was taciturn for a long time, as his sight fell on Shen Yanxiao\u2019s smiling face. This child\u2019s appearance was said to have no resemblance of her parents, but when she\u2019d smiled now, there had nevertheless been just a hint of Shen Yu from in the past.. Shen Feng\u2019s gaze seemed to have sunk a little, and then, taking a deep breath, he said, \u201cSince Xiaoxiao is to inherit the position of the clan leader in the future, she nevertheless has to suffer these hardships, else how could she take bigger responsibilities upon herself?!\u201dShen Feng was supporting Shen Yanxiao till the end.Shen Feng\u2019s persistence not only had Shen Yue and Shen Duan incessantly astonished, even Shen Yanxiao felt a trace of unconvincingness.What those two scoundrel uncles of hers had said had actually been quite reasonable, and in accordance with Shen Feng\u2019s temperament of the former days, it was most likely that he\u2019d select their proposition. However, today, what kind of ghost had Shen Feng met such that he\u2019d unexpectedly help her so much?Was this because of the Vermillion Bird? However, in their eyes, she was merely the Vermillion Bird\u2019s vessel; it still hadn\u2019t reached the point where it needed this much of attachment of importance.Shen Feng\u2019s approach truly made Shen Yanxiao very hard to understand.\u201cFather! Xiaoxiao can\u2019t cultivate any magic or Dou Qi however! If you\u2019re to permit her to ascend to the position of the clan leader, then someday in the future\u2026\u201d Shen Duan still wanted to persuade Shen Feng, but he\u2019d already impatiently interrupted his words.\u201cShe\u2019s my granddaughter. Even if she\u2019s unable to cultivate Dou Qi and magic, if it wasn\u2019t something to be alarmed off. In this entire world, don\u2019t tell me that, besides cultivating Dou Qi and magic, there just isn\u2019t any other ways for her to to defend herself with? Stupid!\u201d Shen Feng was somewhat angry for the two sons of his that\u2019d ad repeatedly opposed him and this made him somewhat displeased.\u201cI\u2019ve already made the proper preparations. After a month, the Holy Roland School will begin recruiting a new batch of students, and when the time comes, I\u2019ll have Xiaoxiao enter the Holy Roland School\u2019s field of pharmacy.\u201dLiked it?

It could be said that, if there was anything on this world that people valued even more than formidable warriors and magicians, then it was only pharmacists.Although pharmacists\u2019 ability in strength were inferior, they possessed the capabilities to manufacture all kinds of mystical medicine. With the capabilities of a high level pharmacist, one would be able to refine a high level of medicine that would in turn help him win over a lot of experts. Pharmacist didn\u2019t have very strong fighting capabilities, but still had very powerful connections. Anyone would rather go and offend a magic tutor than willingly go and offend a high level pharmacist, because the moment anyone provoked a high level pharmacist, it\u2019d be very likely that that person would have to face the encirclement and pursuit of the formidable powers behind that pharmacist!It was evident that Shen Feng\u2019s intent was for Shen Yanxiao to abandon her pursuit for formidable fighting strength, and to switch over to the development of even more powerful connections. The moment that Shen Yanxiao was able to make a breakthrough to the standard of a high level pharmacist, her completed medicine would quickly act to draw in countless tremendous powers and reclusive experts to her.And since she had such strong backing, even if they were the other 4 large clans, they absolutely wouldn\u2019t rashly make a move against the Vermillion Bird Clan.Because, no matter when, the moment when they wanted to deal with Shen Yanxiao, they all had to seriously consider the network of her relationship behind her back.\u201cFather\u2026are you playing a joke?\u201d The corner of Shen Yue\u2019s mouth incessantly twitched.There were many that wanted to be pharmacists, but the number of people that were genuinely capable of assuming the position were nevertheless very few. This was because the circumstances required to become a pharmacist were much more challenging than cultivating Dou Qi and magic. Not only does one need exceedingly strong mental strength and extremely keen perception, but having a steady temperament is even more an of absolute necessity. As for those that had all of these things, they\u2019d later still have to possess innate skill regarding medicine. Else, all of these things would merely be idle chit-chat.If it was such an easy thing to become a pharmacist, then all kinds of medicine wouldn\u2019t be priced so high within the Long Xuan EmpireShen Yanxiao was previously an idiot, yet why would Shen Feng think of having this kind of trash that had just been recently reinstated to normal enter the Holy Roland School\u2019s pharmaceutical field of study?Shen Feng coldly glanced at Shen Duan, before saying, \u201cYour courage is getting bigger and bigger now. You even went so far as to dare to come and question my words?\u201dShen Yue immediately closed his mouth.\u201cIt still hasn\u2019t reached the point of any you guys\u2019 butting in regarding the way how I do things. You all had better listened properly. Xiaoxiao is the heir that I\u2019ve decided on, and if someday in the future you guys dare to to speak even one sentence of nonsense, then you can be the ones to tidy up your things and roll out to the branch clan!\u201d Shen Feng furiously stood, his penetrating gaze sweeping through everyone that was present, then warning them not to speak any nonsense.The disciples of the Vermillion Bird Clan that were experiencing a myriad of emotions immediately calmed downShen Yanxiao was sitting to the side, passively watching. Shen Feng\u2019s strict upholding of Shen Yanxiao had somewhat made it hard for the people to accept it. If she didn\u2019t remember it wrongly, Shen Feng and herself simply weren\u2019t close at all. As for Shen Feng\u2019s sudden bearing, even if it was to say this was for the sake of the Vermillion Bird\u2019s face, it was still rather somewhat unconventional reasoning.Unknowingly, in the depths of Shen Yanxiao\u2019s heart, a somewhat absurd thought had been birthed.The attitude that Shen Feng had towards Shen Yanxiao during their everyday interactions simply wasn\u2019t much, but, even if wasn\u2019t because of how much other people discussed it, Shen Feng nevertheless didn\u2019t have Shen Yanxiao driven away from the main branch of the Vermillion Bird Clan, and had also never been deficient in her supply of food and clothing everyday.In fact, on that day where Shen Qiu had visited her, Shen Yanxiao had felt that it was somewhat odd for Shen Qiu was Shen Feng\u2019s trusted physician. Even if she were to be visited by a physician, it should\u2019ve been unlikely to go as far as to truly utilise Shen Qiu.Liked it?

Shen Ling, if the Vermillion Bird over there has any sort of demands, you need to satisfy him as soon as possible. As for the others, go and do what you ought to be doing! Xiaoxiao, follow me to the study room for a while.\u201d\u2026It was the first time that Shen Yanxiao had entered Shen Feng\u2019s study room. Contained within the simple and unadorned room, besides that desk, were bookshelves upon bookshelves, stuffed with ancient books. The Vermillion Bird Clan was very richly provided for, but Shen Feng\u2019s study room was unexpectedly relatively unadorned. He wouldn\u2019t treat anyone from the clan harshly, but by himself, he was nevertheless very frugal.\u201cHave a seat.\u201d Shen Feng looked at Shen Yanxiao with a smile on his face.Complying with his words, Shen Yanxiao sat. She didn\u2019t know why Shen Feng had called her over, and could only wait for Shen Feng to open his mouth.From the back of the desk, Shen Feng took out a scroll painting and passed it over to Shen Yanxiao.Shen Yanxiao unrolled the scroll painting. On top of the picture was a drawing of a couple\u2014standing side by side. The man appeared to be a little more than 20 years old, his unusually elegant face far better compared than Shen Yifeng\u2019s by a hundred times. Although this was merely a drawing, the man\u2019s elegant appearance was nevertheless vivid and lifelike. The corner of his eyes carried smiles and left people with a feeling of endearment. As for the woman whom was snuggling up at his side, and who appeared to be extremely petite, her pretty face had a pair of extremely charming, quick-witted, and big eyes. The woman\u2019s facial features were seemingly so perfect that they couldn\u2019t be picked on. She was akin to a fairy that had fallen into the mundane world, and made people unable to bear to have her move away from their line of sight.The two people in this picture were so perfect that it didn\u2019t seem to be real.\u201cThese are your parents. Merely, it\u2019s a pity that not long after you\u2019d been born, they departed from this world.\u201d Shen Feng\u2019s voice was downcast. He felt regret as he struggled to find the words to say.Shen Yanxiao was extremely astonished, and she finally understood why Shen Yue and the others had always said that she wasn\u2019t Shen Yu\u2019s child. With this pair of parents, how was it possible that the child they gave birth to would have an appearance that was so mediocre? There was no need to speak of Shen Yue and Shen Duan, even Shen Yanxiao doubted her own identity at this moment.\u201cI don\u2019t look like them.\u201dShen Feng laughed as he said, \u201cAlthough you don\u2019t look like them, after you recovered to normal, your smiling expression nevertheless has a hint of your father\u2019s look.\u201dShen Yanxiao touched her own mediocre, little face, for she found it very hard to believe that her own smiling expression unexpectedly resembles the man that was on the picture scroll.Her appearance wasn\u2019t just firmly that of an ugly duckling, and using two white swans to describe the two people that were inscribed on the picture scroll simply wasn\u2019t sufficient.Even if it were a genetic mutation, this change was unavoidably too excessive. There certainly wasn\u2019t any kind of plastic surgery in this era, and it was evident that these two people were naturally born so perfect. As a result, why was it that her appearance, as their daughter caused people to feel that she was so\u2026 so ghastly in comparison!Shen Yanxiao\u2019s mouth twitched, for the heavens truly didn\u2019t like her much. For her to look like this despite having such good-looking parents\u2026 she\u2019d really let down her parents\u2019 beauty.\u201cYour father was my youngest son, and was also my pride. I had once hoped that, if there were a day that the Vermillion Bird were able to be roused, then I must have him be the Vermillion Bird\u2019s master. He was very intelligent, and regarding Dou Qi, his gift was very high. Everyone said that Yifeng was a rarely seen genius of the century for the Vermillion Bird Clan. However, when compared to your father, there was nevertheless a huge discrepancy.\u201d Shen Feng stood behind Shen Yanxiao, looking at the son of his that was on the picture scroll. The once most-prided son of his, as of now, was eternally separated from him, and he\u2019d never be able to see him again. Even though it was Shen Feng, at present, it was hard for him to conceal the sorrow inside his eyes.Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Moreover that, throughout your lifetime, you\u2019d be incapable of cultivating Dou Qi and magic. Seeing that that time where you were still in your infancy, I felt very bad, for I\u2019m more clear than anyone else about the internal struggles of the Vermillion Bird Clan. You don\u2019t have any parents to rely on, and in regards to you, it\u2019s a fortunate thing that you\u2019re unable to cultivate Dou Qi and magic.\u201d Shen Feng sighed.Shen Yanxiao nodded. She understood that Shen Feng\u2019s implicit meaning was focused on that section of his wording. The Vermillion Bird Clan\u2019s branches were extremely numerous. The fight between Shen Duan and Shen Yue had been that ferocious already. If, during that time, she hadn\u2019t been a cripple, without the protection of her parents, it\u2019s very likely that she would\u2019ve been secretly eliminated long ago by someoneEven if Shen Feng had had the intention to protect her, he was already getting on in age, and after he exhausted the last years of his life protecting her, she\u2019d have no one to depend on once more. Shen Yue and the others would\u2019ve had no lack of methods to deal with her then.Shen Yanxiao\u2019s previous doubt instantly became clear because of Shen Feng\u2019s words.Shen Feng\u2019s estrangement and neglect when regarding her were both undoubtedly a kind of protection. So long as it made other people feel like Shen Yanxiao wouldn\u2019t be a possible obstacle through the journey they were battling, she\u2019d be genuinely safe. Shen Qiu\u2019s attending to her in the dark was certainly Shen Feng\u2019s incitation, and it was very likely that even Shen Siyu\u2019s doting had at least a small portion to do with Shen Feng.After all, Shen Feng couldn\u2019t attach too much importance to her on the surface. He could only arrange for Shen Siyu, someone who didn\u2019t have any blood relationship with the Vermillion Bird Clan, to take care of her thoroughly.Shen Yanxiao\u2019s eye sockets became slightly emitted wet for this dignified elderly man. From start to finish, he\u2019d always been secretly scheming for her, so that in the future she\u2019d have a way to survive. If there hadn\u2019t been Shen Feng\u2019s careful planning, it\u2019s very likely that she\u2019d already have died.Shen Yanxiao, who\u2019d never felt familial love before, found it very hard to express the current emotions she felt in her heart. It was as if she was a little animal that\u2019d always been tossed to the corner to emerge or perish on its own in the past, but had suddenly discovered that this whole time, there\u2019d always been someone cautiously and solemnly attending to her.As for Shen Feng\u2019s qualms, she understood his reasoning clearly. The more that she understood, the more that she felt that she was precious.At that time, she was indeed an idiot\u2014a trash\u2014but also someone that looked completely different than Shen Yu. For Shen Feng to protect her in this way\u2026 it could be said that he\u2019d exhausted a great amount of his life\u2019s blood into it.Shen Yanxiao, for the first time, felt that her own voice was somewhat choked with sobs. She wasn\u2019t cold and ruthless. Merely, there\u2019d never been anyone that have her treated as a human in her previous life. She, to the organisation, was merely a tool. And to her companions in the organisation, she had merely been a target to compete with. What she\u2019d previously confronted was an infinite dog-eat-dog world, yet in this world, because of Shen Siyu, she\u2019d begun to, for the first time ever, feel the warmth of being concerned and cared about by people.\u201cGrandfather.\u201d Shen Yanxiao, for the first time, wholeheartedly called Shen Feng.Even if she wasn\u2019t this body\u2019s genuine master,she\u2019d taken its place as its master, and had livedon.She\u2019d act as the original\u2019s replacement, and completely live her life as such.Shen Feng\u2019s eye sockets were slightly red as he gratifyingly nodded his head. Rubbing his granddaughter\u2019s hair, he lovingly said, \u201cIt\u2019s been hard on you these past years, but now that you\u2019ve reinstated your wisdom, and have also obtained the Vermillion Bird, grandfather will no longer need to be worried about you being bullied by your uncles anymore. Be at ease, so long as your grandfather\u2019s still around, you won\u2019t have anyone that can bully you again.\u201d He\u2019d originally wanted his granddaughter to proceed with the live of a mediocre persom\u2014carefree and without worries. However, the Heavens forbade it, and had unexpectedly reinstated her wisdom. In that way, he certainly had the same expectations that he\u2019d previously had for Shen Yu completely invested into this child\u2019s body.\u201cXiaoxiao, now that you\u2019ve become intelligent, there are some words that grandfather wants to tell you.\u201d\u201cDo speak, grandfather.\u201dLiked it?

Since you\u2019ve obtained the Vermillion Bird, your uncles won\u2019t dare to to do anything to you, but you still nevertheless need the capability to defend yourself. On the surface, the 5 big clans appear to be harmonious, but their relationships in private are nevertheless bad. Particularly of note is that, during these years where the 5 mythological beasts were lying dormant, the relationship between the five of us has worsened more and more. If you\u2019re to take the clan master seat of the Vermillion Bird Clan, then you certainly need to have your own ways of protecting yourself. Therefore, I\u2019ve arranged for you to go to the Holy Roland School this time. When you arrive, you must diligently study.\u201d Shen Feng\u2019s brow was tightly wrinkled. There were still many things that could happen in the future that had made him worried. Luckily, this small granddaughter of his had become very intelligent, and the things that he didn\u2019t point out, she\u2019d already guessed at.\u201cHowever, I don\u2019t understand anything about things like medicine.\u201d Shen Yanxiao was somewhat vexed, for she had the capability to cultivate both magic and Dou Qi, yet simply didn\u2019t have any knowledge or understanding whatsoever regarding medicine. Her understanding towards being a pharmacist basically stopped at those bottles of low-level face changing medicine that were expensive enough that they could scare people to death.\u201cThere\u2019s no need to worry about that, grandfather wouldn\u2019t have you go and do things that completely lacked possibility.\u201d Shen Feng laughed lightly as he pointed towards the woman n the picture scroll, whom was absolutely pretty, then said, \u201cAs for your mother, Wen Ya, people only knew her as the number one beauty of the Long Xuan Empire, but what they didn\u2019t know was that she was also an extremely powerful high-level pharmacist.\u201d\u201cEh?\u201d Flabbergasted, Shen Yanxiao gazed down at the beautiful woman on the picture scroll, whose smiling appearance was like a flower, while she digested the information that she\u2019d heard.\u201cYour mother\u2019s clan was very mysterious. When she appeared in the Long Xuan Empire, because of her good-lookingness, an awful lot of people took note of her. During that time, when your father was getting to know your mother, I too had specially dispatched people to look into your mother\u2019s identity, however, nothing was found. Later, your father insisted on marrying her, and I wasn\u2019t in a position to say anything more. However, your mother seeked me out after their marriage, and told me that she possessed the abilities of a high-level pharmacist. However, she had me keep this matter confidential, and she could only secretly manufacture medicine and supply it to our clan.After Wen Ya married into the Vermillion Bird Clan, the Vermillion Bird Clan\u2019s medicine supply once became the leader amongst the 5 large clans. The people\u2019s rumours state that the Vermillion Bird Clan had a reclusive high level pharmacist, yet no one knew that the person that was responsible was precisely the young lady that had recently married into the Vermillion Bird Clan.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t believe that your mother\u2019s clan is simple at all. However, after your mother\u2019s death, her clan didn\u2019t have any sort of movement. You\u2019re her daughter, thus you should naturally inherit her gift within your body. I\u2019ve often pondered it; could it be that your deficiency in magic and Dou Qi was due to the heredity gift that you received from your mother?\u201d Shen Feng dignifiedly said, \u201cNo matter whether it\u2019s true or not, after you\u2019ve entered the Holy Roland School, you must diligently study. It would naturally be for the best if you were able to inherit your mother\u2019s gift, but if you aren\u2019t able to, I\u2019ll think of another way of thoroughly protecting you.\u201dHaving the Vermillion Bird to accompany her, Shen Feng was no longer helpless. At least, now, the others in the clan simply weren\u2019t sufficient to threaten Shen Yanxiao\u2019s safety. He could also make more arrangements for her because of this.Shen Yanxiao inhaled deeply, for how Shen Feng had treated her was truly giving his best. Out of all of the methods that he\u2019d considered, all of them had considered her future.\u201cThat\u2019s all. You head back first. During this period of time, make sure to get a proper rest. After a few days, I\u2019ll have Siyu teach you how to be familiar with the matters within the clan.\u201d Shen Feng patted Shen Yanxiao\u2019s shoulder; and had the little bastard, who\u2019d been unendingly emotionally touched, brought out of the room.Liked it?

As he sat in his chair, he took a deep breath. His sight fell on the rear of the study room.\u201cYou already knew that when Xiaoxiao proceeded towards the lava valley, she\u2019d certainly be chosen by the Vermillion Bird, didn\u2019t you? Therefore, only then, did you insist on having me to add her to the list of candidates?\u201d Shen Feng suddenly opened his mouth and asked.\u201cWhether or not I knew that isn\u2019t important. Since you\u2019ve welcomed the Vermillion Bird and were also able to save your granddaughter, isn\u2019t that good enough?\u201d Accompanying the refined voice was a body wearing light blue clothing, Shen Siyu, who proceeded to slowly walk out from the rear screen of the room. The previous tender look he\u2019d had in the daytime was now exceptionally cold and detached.\u201cYou\u2019re right, that\u2019s very good.\u201d Shen Feng nodded.\u201cThat\u2019s already sufficient. As for the Holy Roland School, you must have people bribing it appropriately. Before she graduates, you mustn\u2019t let anyone outside of the Vermillion Bird Clan know about her circumstances.\u201d Shen Siyu coldly and detachedly looked at Shen Feng, without the slightest bit of respect of the daytime.Shen Feng looked at the Shen Siyu whom was before him, whom was as different as black and white. It appeared that Shen Feng was already accustomed to Shen Siyu\u2019s current attitude.Having Shen Yanxiao added to the Vermillion Bird\u2019s candidate list wasn\u2019t really a part of Shen Feng\u2019s last minute plan that he\u2019d devised, but rather was something that this youngster before his eyes had insisted upon.\u201cYou\u2019re afraid that the other clans will have some sort of movement?\u201dShen Siyu lightly nodded and indifferently like a cold wind, he said, \u201cI won\u2019t allow anyone to injure her before she\u2019s able to protect herself.\u201d\u2026\u201cSpeaking of it, how\u2019s that pharmacist?\u201d As soon as Shen Yanxiao had returned to her room, she\u2019d sat on the chair. She was both very careful and extremely touched regarding Shen Feng\u2019s suggestion. However, she didn\u2019t plan to inform anyone about her current strength, that she had cultivated both Dou Qi and magic, because as of now, she still wasn\u2019t strong enough. If she was to prematurely reveal her own trump card, it\u2019d only allow her enemies the ability to plan even better against her.The Vermillion Bird was currently lying on the bed on its stomach. After resting for a decent period of time, he\u2019d finally recovered some vigor. However, subsequently, his completely self-important face had also returned.\u2018Being a pharmacist is a pretty good pick, however the question is whether or not you have sufficient mental strength.\u2019 Regarding Shen Yanxiao\u2019s matter of becoming strong, Xiu paid quite a lot attention to.\u201cThen, there shouldn\u2019t be a problem, right? The main issue is about the undoing of the seal; as for the others, they\u2019re still okay.\u201d Shen Yanxiao could still be counted to be understanding towards her current circumstances. After her seal had been undone, her promotion speed was akin to a rocket taking off. Therefore, she wasn\u2019t worried about wasting too much of her time cultivating both Dou Qi and magic. Actually, this pharmacist thing that seemed to have quite an easy way to earn money held quite an awful lot of her interest.\u2018If that\u2019s so, give it a try then. However, the role of an ordinary pharmacist isn\u2019t that big; only when you\u2019ve ascended to a higher level, will you only then magnified out its role.\u201d Xiu seriously analyzed as he spoke.\u201cWait a minute!\u201d The Vermillion Bird, which had been lying down as stiff as a corpse on the bed, suddenly jumped up. He looked at Shen Yanxiao and said, \u201cSeal? What seal?\u201dShen Yanxiao shot a glance towards the Vermillion Bird, and naively rolled up her sleeve so that her 7 Stars Locking Moon Seal on her hand was visible.\u201cThis is the 7 Stars Locking Moon?!\u201d The Vermillion Bird looked astonishingly at Shen Yanxiao.\u201cYou, little girl, who have you offended for someone to unexpectedly spend this much of their strength to give you the 7 Stars Locking Moon?!\u201dShen Yanxiao looked suspiciously at the Vermillion Bird. It was very clear that the Vermillion Bird knew about this seal as well.\u201cYou know about this seal?\u201dThe Vermillion Bird snorted and said, \u201cNonsense! I\u2019ve lived more than ten thousand years. The 7 Stars Locking Moon Seal was what people researched and created a few millennia ago, during the war with the Devil God. Most of the seals were used on captives of both sides\u2014the formidable wargods.

If it weren\u2019t for the fact that Xiu had told her, it was very likely that she simply wouldn\u2019t have discovered that there was a seal on her body.\u2018That\u2019s right. The 7 Stars Locking Moon Seal was initially developed by the God Emperor of the God race in order to deal with the devil race. Later, the information was unknowingly stolen and brought over to the devil clan\u2019s side, where it then finally spread between both clans.\u2019 Xiu had actually agreed with the Vermillion Bird\u2019s words.\u2018At first, I was also very curious as to why this sort of seal would appear on you, on this human body.\u2019Shen Yanxiao was a little bit dazed. The information that Xiu and the Vermillion Bird had just given her was too much, and she truly didn\u2019t know just where should she start from.\u201cHowever, your body has this thing, which means that the power within your body is far more than what you currently have. Not bad. I believe that as soon as you\u2019ve undone the seventh layer of the seal, you ought to be entitled to become my genuine master.\u201d The Vermillion Bird was very pleased as he learned about the new discovery, for he truly didn\u2019t wish for his own master to have the ordinariness of an ordinary person, as this would greatly harm his face as a mythological beast.\u201cXiu will help me undo the seal. However, before then, it seems like there\u2019s still something that I ought to do.\u201d Shen Yanxiao recalled that she\u2019d still fallen short of the final batch of low level crystallic nuclei that she\u2019d yet get her hands on. The period of time where she\u2019d gone to the lava valley had delayed her progress, but the sage still hadn\u2019t left, and she truly felt that it wasn\u2019t proper for her to make her move on the imperial palace.\u201cHe can undo the 7 Stars Locking Moon Seal?\u201d He was flabbergasted regarding Shen Yanxiao\u2019s words. As far as he knew, the number of people that could actually undo the 7 Star Locking Moon weren\u2019t many. Moreover, a majority of them had died millenias ago, during the wartime between the gods and the devils.Shen Yanxiao nodded.The Vermillion Bird became even more curious about Xiu\u2019s identity.No matter how curious the Vermillion Bird was, Shen Yanxiao didn\u2019t have the mood to match its vigorous curiosity. She urgently needed this last batch of the crystallic nuclei to be collected, and then to properly have Xiu help her undo the second layer of the seal. She\u2019d already planned that, before she went to the Holy Roland School, she\u2019d focus on her Dou Qi cultivation until it reached rank 6.Very soon, Shen Yanxiao\u2019s opportunity had come. The sage\u2019s arrival hadn\u2019t just made every single influential official within the imperial capital take note of it, it had even made the people from the other 4 large clans restless. Everyone knew that, in this world, the only person that could rouse the mythological beasts was the sage from the God\u2019s Domain.The four large clans immediately sent out invitations for the sage to help them. In just a few days, the sage was dragged away by the people of the White Tiger Clan.There was no longer a need to think; Shen Yanxiao knew that, in the following few days, the sage and the people from the God\u2019s Domain would all depart from the imperial capital, and would proceed towards the place where the White TIger was currently lying dormant. This would be the best chance for her to make a moveOn one moonless night, this heartless little thief that\u2019d been silent for so long, finally moved once again. This time, she had her pair of sin-like claws extended towards the imperial palace that was strictly guarded.However, this time, Shen Yanxiao was extremely careful not to steal any luxury goods that were extremely special, instead targeting things that were solidly cash. Moreover, this time, she was even more bold, for she directly stole from the Long Xuan Empire\u2019s treasury. She swept through their money like a gale, storing all of the money that she could within her storage ring.The emperor couldn\u2019t even begin to fathom how powerful the Qilin Auction House was. Once the emperor discovered the theft, he\u2019d definitely have the entire city searched. She didn\u2019t want to take any golden tools or precious stones that had distinctive features and would allow others to discover her whereabouts.She couldn\u2019t help but say that the Long Xuan Empire\u2019s treasury truly was\u2026 quite well-off, ah!She\u2019d forcibly stuffed all of her storage rings full to the brim.That however, was a full one hundred cubic meters of empty space she could utilize! It was very hard for even Shen Yanxiao herself to estimate just how much money she\u2019d taken in the end. However, even with how much she had taken, she\u2019d only emptied out a tenth of the total amount of gold coins in the Long Xuan Empire\u2019s treasury.Liked it?

She immediately emptied out a portion of the gold coins she\u2019d collected, and squeezed these few hundred of high-level crystallic nuclei into her storage ring.After being certain that a single gold coin couldn\u2019t be squeezed into her storage ring, Shen Yanxiao swiped her sleeves casually and snuck out from the treasury.As for the expression the emperor would have when he inspected the treasury during the next interval, and when he\u2019d noticed that one side of it was emptied, no one would know.Shen Yanxiao returned from her rewarding journey in the early morning of the next day. After using a bottle of a low-level medicine that changed her facial features, she once again visited the Qilin Auction House. Qi Meng had already made proper preparations to allow the repossession of the golden tools and precious stones. Carrying a favourable attitude akin to \u2018at worst, they\u2019ll just think that the auction house has opened up a sideline to sell luxury goods\u2019, Qi Meng received Shen Yanxiao.However, this time, Shen Yanxiao didn\u2019t have anythings to sell in her stead. Instead, she\u2019d actually given them a large quantity of gold coins, in return for them helping her buy low-level crystallic nuclei.. The money that she\u2019d paid them wasn\u2019t a small sum, so much so that Qi Meng proceeded to purchase every grade of crystallic nuclei, from various places, for an unlimited time duration for her.Even if Qi Meng were to smash his head open, he still couldn\u2019t find an answer as to why a little bastard like this would want as many crystallic nuclei as was asked for.Although the question existed in his mind, with money it was easy to handle things. Less than two days later, Qi Meng had the final batch of low-level crystallic nuclei handed over to Shen Yanxiao.Inside of her room, Shen Yanxiao finally had the final few thousand low-level crystallic nuclei she needed, and taking the place of Xiu, she proceeded to thoroughly absorb them. However, just after she\u2019d absorbed all of the low-level crystallic nuclei, she astonishingly discovered that, within her mind, a fuzzy figure had vaguely appeared.Xiu\u2019s voice came directly from that fuzzy figure.\u2018It\u2019s time to help you undo the second layer of your seal.\u2019Shen Yanxiao was startled. Could it be that the crystallic nuclei hadn\u2019t only helped Xiu recover his strength, but had also helped him recover his body?\u2018This is nothing more than merely a mental reflection. It certainly isn\u2019t that simple to reconstruct one\u2019s body \u2018 Xiu punctually undid Shen Yanxiao\u2019s doubt.In the past few days, the Vermillion Bird had been enjoying the filial respect shown by every person of the Vermillion Bird Clan. At this moment, he was lazily loafing around on a chair. Coiling his little legs, he looked at the 7 Stars Locking Moon Seal that was on Shen Yanxiao\u2019s arm, where the seal gradually began to show a change.The undoing of the seal for the second time used an entire night. The next day, when Shen Yanxiao woke up from her slumber, she could feel that her entire body was as if it\u2019d been fished up from a river\u2014it was soaking wet all over. What made her even more depressed were the damp patches of filth that were on her body. Gloomily, she immediately had people fetch water so she could bathe.However, the servant girl that she\u2019d called into the room just stared blankly the first moment she saw Shen Yanxiao. Soon afterwards, the servant girl entered the room as if to take a closer look at something. It made Shen Yanxiao dumbfoundedly say a few sentences. Only then did the servant girl absentmindedly withdraw through the door of the room.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with her? Is fetching water that much trouble?\u201d Shen Yanxiao was somewhat baffled by the servant girl\u2019s attitude.Just then, the Vermillion Bird had woken up. On his bed, he was rubbing his eyes. Seeing Shen Yanxiao, who was standing before him, he was immediately struck dumb.Her fair skin akin to the highest quality of silk fabric. Under the erect tip of her nose was a pair of naturally red lips. Her eyes that had already originally been clear and shining, now appeared to be even more amply filled with intelligence. When she blinked her eyes, it was as if they could talk.If it wasn\u2019t that he\u2019d already set up a spiritual link with Shen Yanxiao, the Vermillion Bird simply wouldn\u2019t have dared to believe that this stunning little beauty standing before him was that previously ugly person!Liked it?

The ugly duckling had transformed into a swan!! Compared to plastic surgery, this was even more efficient!It\u2019s no wonder that, previously, that servant girl\u2019s expression had been that strange.Thinking about it again, this seal was really very malicious, ah! Not only did it seal one\u2019s strength, even one\u2019s appearance would be unexpectedly sealed!The current Shen Yanxiao\u2019s looks could be said to be a combination of all of Shen Yu and Wen Ya\u2019s merits. Compared to her parents\u2019 beauty, she\u2019d even surpassed them. If Shen Yue and the others were to see the current Shen Yanxiao, it\u2019s very likely that they\u2019d no longer say that Shen Yanxiao wasn\u2019t a person of the Vermillion Bird Clan!However\u2026\u201cThis isn\u2019t fitting!!!\u201d With her little face replaced by this kind of outstanding beauty, how would she still able to disguise herself as a passerby after she\u2019d finished a misdeed someday in the future!Shen Yanxiao was very depressed, for no matter how much she\u2019d thought about it, she would\u2019ve never expected that the undoing of the second layer of 7 Stars Locking Moon would bring about this much of an influence; and this certainly wasn\u2019t what she was willing to look at now.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d While the Vermillion Bird was still immersed in joy about his owns little master\u2019s face, where the \u2018old had been replaced with the new\u2019, he\u2019d then noticed that Shen Yanxiao had quickly shut the windows and door tight. She then immediately sat before the dressing table. She took bottle after bottle out, and jars upon jars, before she proceeded to torment her own face.\u201cDoing things that I ought to do!\u201d Shen Yanxiao, at this very moment, was rejoicing over her own previous foresight. Previously, for the matter of changing her appearance, she\u2019d frequently gone out to gather things. Although low level face-changing medicine was useful, the restriction due to the price truly wasn\u2019t worth making it a general product. In order to facilitate her future, she\u2019d had no choice but to go to the cosmetic store within the imperial capital in order to buy a few things that\u2019d make it a little bit more convenient for her to change her appearance.She had no desire or want towards carrying around this kind of face that was capable of causing the downfall of of a city. Now, within the Vermillion Bird Clan, she was already that eye-catching, and with the matter of Shen Feng also making arrangements for her to go to the Holy Roland School, she could imagine the results if she herself were to have this kind of stunning face that could cause the downfall of a city as she entered the school, and it was very likely that, from that day onwards, she\u2019d have no idle days to pass by.Being good-looking was what every woman\u2019s lifetime pursuement was, and towards this, Shen Yanxiao still didn\u2019t have too much of an interest in it. What she had even more hope for was that all of her body could match her operations.How nice it\u2019d be for her to have that previously unprepossessing face. Wherever she went, she\u2019d just be thoroughly ignored by people, and it was so much more of a convenience to her to take advantage of a crisis for her personal gain.Fortunately, changing her face and so on wasn\u2019t difficult at all for Shen Yanxiao. In her previous life, she\u2019d after all been a professional thief, and randomly giving herself a cosmetic change wasn\u2019t too difficult of a matter. If it weren\u2019t for the insufficient allocation in this era, she simply wouldn\u2019t need something like face-changing medicine, and she could\u2019ve just turned herself into a completely different kind of person.With only these few items that were in hands however, wanting to have a thorough cosmetic change was impossible; but smearing her looks for a while still wasn\u2019t a problem.In fact, there wasn\u2019t any particular changes on Shen Yanxiao\u2019s facial features, other than they were merely a bit more refined compared to the past. The biggest change rested with that faultlessly fair and clean skin of hers.Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

[Note: The saying here means that white skin can cover for the many other weak points on the face]Towards this matter of her skin being excessively fair, it was actually very easy to deal with! So long as one darkened it once again, then wouldn\u2019t it be alright?Thinking about it, because of the lifelong pursuement to be an even more stunning beauty within the 24th century, there were many beauties that had spent quite a large amount of effort towards both their body\u2019s and face\u2019s, and yet the her now unexpectedly wanted to have this good-looking face that would cause everyone to be green with envy masked over.If there was anyone that knew about Shen Yanxiao\u2019s \u2018inhuman\u2019 way of doing things, it\u2019d be very likely that that person would immediately jump out and have her choked to death.However, apart from Shen Yanxiao, the person that was particularly \u2018cruel\u2019 to herself,there was only the Vermillion Bird left within the room, whose esthetic concept was extremely twisted.In the Vermillion Bird\u2019s eyes, Shen Yanxiao had indeed become very good-looking, but she still hadn\u2019t reached the stage where it could have him, a mythological beast, prostrate before her. Moreover, as a mythological beast, its master\u2019s strength was regarded as the most important, and by no means were the looks seen as more important comparatively.What\u2019s the use in looking good? Is it that one wouldn\u2019t need to pay money after a meal if one was good-looking?Thus, as the only thing that could prevent Shen Yanxiao\u2019s ego from ruining her existence, the Vermillion Bird simply silently sat to the side and looked at Shen Yanxiao with brimming interest as she used her \u2018poisonous hands\u2019 on herself.Outside the door of Shen Yanxiao\u2019s room, the muddleheaded servant girl had brought a barrel of hot water, and was anxiously standing at the doorway. At her side was another servant girl who was carrying a bucket.\u201cAre you certain that you didn\u2019t see wrongly?\u201d The servant girl, whose face was filled with curiosity, asked her companion. Just now, after this servant girl had returned from the seventh young lady\u2019s room, it was as if she\u2019d become completely muddle headed. Only after being silent for a long time, did she burst out with the astonishing news.Within a single night, their clan\u2019s mediocre seventh young lady had turned into a huge beauty.She originally didn\u2019t believe her companion\u2019s words, after all, the beautiful dream where one turned endlessly beautiful within a single night existed within every female\u2019s heart, but it merely existed in that dream, that\u2019s all. If there truly was someone that had this kind of change happen in reality, then it\u2019d frighten people to death.However, her companion had nevertheless been very certain that she hadn\u2019t seen it wrongly, and thus she herself was finally unable to resist her interest, and so she went along with her companion.\u201cI\u2019m certain that I\u2019m right.\u201d The servant girl that had previously come resolutely and decisively opened her mouth.\u201cWhat I saw was definitely real, and if it weren\u2019t for the fact that the seventh young lady\u2019s voice hadn\u2019t changed, I also truly wouldn\u2019t have been able to recognise her.\u201d\u201cThe seventh young lady really turned into a supreme beauty within a single night? I still find it extremely hard to believe.\u201dStanding outside of the door, the two servant girls muttered, but didn\u2019t dare to knock on the door. In the middle of them chatting, the door of the room was slowly opened.Standing inside the doorway, Shen Yanxiao looked at the two servant girls at the doorway that were momentarily petrified, and was inwardly smirking. To them, she still had that unprepossessing little face, and simply didn\u2019t have even the slightest bit of change compared to her former days.Momentarily, the two servant girls were dumbstruck. The previous servant girl that had come over rubbed and rubbed her eyes, as she found it extremely hard to believe. The seventh young lady that she\u2019d previously seen clearly hadn\u2019t had this appearance!As for the one who\u2019d been prompted by her curiosity, the servant girl that had followed her companion, she was even more depressed in her heart, such that she nearly suffocated to death.Just where had the Shen Yanxiao before her become pretty? That dark and swarthy skin that was dark and lacking in light. And this was a supreme beauty? This simply couldn\u2019t be compared with even one of the Vermillion Bird Clan\u2019s servant girls!She was truly foolish for unexpectedly believing that there\u2019d been someone that had been able to become beautiful in a single night\u2014wasn\u2019t this simply a joke.Pretty girl, ugly girl, she foolishly couldn\u2019t even differentiate the two properly.Because of a certain someone\u2019s \u2018mercilessness and viciousness\u2018, the exceptional beauty of the next generation of the Vermillion Bird Clan had simply been covered in dust and hidden away in the dark.According to Shen Feng\u2019s arrangement, Shen Siyu would very soon begin to bring Shen Yanxiao to be familiar with the Vermillion Bird Clan\u2019s things.Liked it?

Every year, all of the side branches would report their circumstances to Shen Feng. The money and treasures that were harvested by them had to be delivered to the main branch to be distributed. In fact, apart from the Qilin Clan, the other four large clans\u2019 main branches that were in the imperial capital were all merely imposing existences. The ones that were genuinely making profits for their respective clans were the side branches.This was just like the financial groups of the modern era, where the ones that were actually selling the products were the staff below\u2014it\u2019d be enough for the chairman to simply sit in his office and plan strategies.Shen Yanxiao very quickly grasped a rough image of the circumstances within the Vermillion Bird Clan. Regarding her involvement, both Shen Yue and Shen Duan displayed an enormous amount of discontentment, but with the hinderance from Shen Feng\u2019s suppression and Shen Siyu\u2019s existence, they didn\u2019t dare to publicly display any displeasement towards Shen Yanxiao. Moreover, from this period of time onwards, the Vermillion Bird had begun to walk around the interior of the Vermillion Bird Clan. However every time he appeared, he\u2019d certainly cause a burst of disturbance.This was the Vermillion Bird that had disappeared for centuries and who had once again appeared before everyone. Everyone treated the sight of the Vermillion Bird as one of their lifetime\u2019s biggest points of pride. It was to the extent that, every time the Vermillion Bird appeared, there\u2019d be someone that\u2019d attempt to follow him from the front or from the back, and attempt to stay awhile longer with the the mythological beast of folklore. So much so that even the dropped strands of hair from the Vermillion Bird would incite a group of people fighting over it in order to claim it and collect it so that they could give it to their late offsprings so that they could slowly look at it with marvel.These kind of frantic idolizers couldn\u2019t help but cause Shen Yanxiao to associate them with those frantic idolaters of the 24th century.Only after Shen Jiayi and Shen Jiawei had returned, were they capable of smoothly getting out of the bed and moving about\u2014after a full five days of rest. As soon as they were able to move about, they found out that Shen Feng had already hinted that Shen Yanxiao was to be the heir to be the next clan leader. For a moment, the two brats\u2019 minds were at an incomparable loss. At that moment, they realized that the idiot that they themselves had been accustomed to usually bullying had unexpectedly became the future clan leader in one leap. That kind of frame of mind was completely unbearable compared to a third party stepping into a relationship.And, after deeply experiencing the Vermillion Bird\u2019s brutal side, they conducted themselves even more carefully by tucking their tails between their legs within this period of time. When they saw the Vermillion Bird appear, every time, in a flash, they would just rush off and flee from him, for they were deeply afraid the Shen Yanxiao, whom had already been reinstated to normal, would brazenly have the Vermillion Bird make reprisals on them.Shen Yifeng didn\u2019t actually have any response, but not long after he\u2019d returned home, he\u2019d hurriedly departed the Vermillion Bird Clan, and no one was aware as to where he\u2019d run off to.Shen Yanxiao wasn\u2019t any better either, for after the second layer of the seal had been undone, Xiu had launched an even more harsh training on her. During the day, she followed Shen Siyu in order to be familiar with all the affairs of the Vermillion Bird Clan, but as for the night, she was shut in her room by Xiu in order to do all kinds of practices.For the entire 20 days, Shen Yanxiao didn\u2019t have a single good night of sleep, but her Dou Qi nevertheless broke through to rank 6, and this time, among the sword scholar, the knight, and the archer, she\u2019d chosen the archer\u2014an extremely strong and flexible direction to develop. However, because there wasn\u2019t any systematic guidance, from the beginning to the end, she nevertheless hadn\u2019t learned about the professions\u2014even though she\u2019d already chosen which two directions to develop\u2014warlock and archer. She could only continuously purify the intensity of her magic and Dou Qi everyday.As for the studying aspect of a specialised profession, she\u2019d entirely entrust it to the Holy Roland School. The Holy Roland School was one of the the biggest schools in the Long Xuan Empire. No matter whether it was the qualified teachers\u2019 forces, or their hardware facilities, they were all high standards in the Guangming Continent. Although what Shen Feng had arranged for her was an occupation as a pharmacist, so long as she able to actually enter the Holy Roland School, taking the specialised skill books of Dou Qi and magic, to her, were as easy as pie.Liked it?

In order to ensure that she could have more empty space to improve when she was at the Holy Roland School, Shen Yanxiao made a special trip to the Qilin Auction House 3 days before she was to depart, and once again handed over a large amount of gold coins in order to have Qi Meng find a sufficient amount of crystallic nuclei for her within that period of time. After finding them, Qi Meng was to deliver them to the Holy Roland School in intervals.\u201cYou\u2019re a student of the Holy Roland School as well?\u201d When Qi Meng heard Shen Yanxiao say such a thing, he was rather astonished as he looked at this little bastard, who had quite the mediocre appearance.The Holy Roland School\u2019s reputation was enormous within the Long Xuan Empire. Not only was it so because of its formidable education quality, but it was even more so because of its exceedingly demanding conditions. Not talking about anything else, the enormous sum of tuition fees for every semester was sufficient to cause children from ordinary homes to flinch at it.What\u2019s more was that the Holy Roland School had a certain demand in regards to their student\u2019s talent level. No matter what part of the institution you wanted to enter in order to study, you had to reach a certain standard in their entrance exam. Else, even if you were the heir to the throne, the Holy Roland School would make no secret in having you drived out.Within this period of time, the customer in front of him had actually appeared quite frequently at the Qilin Auction House, but with Qi Meng\u2019s eyesight, he couldn\u2019t seriously make out this customer. Apart from being a nouveau riche, what other special talent did she have? Those attractive waist and limbs of hers were impossible to cultivate any formidable level of Dou Qi, and that dispirited mind of hers was what made people have an even harder time linking her with magic.Shen Yanxiao nodded. Xiu had already said that, if she wanted to have the third layer of her seal undone, relying solely on low level devil nuclei was already marginally insufficient. This time, she\u2019d specifically instructed that Qi Meng take note of both mid-level devil nuclei and high-level devil nuclei for her. She still didn\u2019t know how long she\u2019d be attending the Holy Roland School for, thus she might as well go ahead and have Qi Meng dispatch people to have the things delivered to her directly. As the saying goes, money makes things easier, and so long as the money went to the right place, the Qilin Auction House would be her best collaborative partner.\u201cThis is actually very coincidental.\u201d A rather conspicuous and indolent voice echoed out from behind Shen Yanxiao.It was unknown when Qi Xia had come to the Qilin Auction House\u2019s rear hall and lazily leaned on the door frame, to be just in time to hear Shen Yanxiao\u2019s words just now. A pair of fox-like eyes, that were long and narrow, carried a smile as they squinted.Was it him? Shen Yanxiao recognised the look that Qi Xia had. She remembered that when she\u2019d come to the Qilin Auction House for the first time, this youngster had been sitting in the rear hall, and from start to finish, he\u2019d gazed at her with an appearance that was full of interest. However, ever since then, she\u2019d no longer seen him in the Qilin Auction House, thus she hadn\u2019t expected that she\u2019d come across him once more today.\u201cLooking at your age, you should be a new student that\u2019s on the eve of entering the school. If that\u2019s so, you ought to call me your senior.\u201d Qi Xia looked at the little bastard before him beamingly. In this period of time, Qi Meng had always had information about this customer transmitted to him. When he\u2019d come to patrol the Qilin Auction House today, he hadn\u2019t expected to actually have come across her.\u2018Eh?!\u2019 Shen Yanxiao blinked her eyes. Could it be that\u2026\u201cI\u2019m a second year student from the magician\u2019s branch of the Holy Roland School.\u201d Qi Xia smiled as he said.Shen Yanxiao instantly said, \u201cHello, senior.\u201dIf the Vermillion Bird were to be beside Shen Yanxiao right now, it\u2019s very likely that he\u2019d have jumped over and given this master of his, that didn\u2019t seem to have any integrity, a slap for she\u2019d just called someone her \u2018senior\u2019 simply because the other people had asked for her to call him \u2018senior\u2019! Are you that familiar with other people?In fact, Shen Yanxiao was somewhat curious towards this youngster before her, because during the first time they\u2019d met, she could vaguely feel right away that this youngster\u2019s influence wasn\u2019t small, for there were very few customers that were permitted to stay within the rear hall of the Qilin Auction House.Liked it?

Currently, she was still cooperating with the Qilin Auction House. Therefore, she naturally wouldn\u2019t do such a dim-witted thing such as offending the group that was cooperating with her.What\u2019s more, it wasn\u2019t like it\u2019d hurt her to call him \u2018senior\u2019, for having one more friend would expand her options. After all, he was a student of the Holy Roland School and who knew, maybe he\u2019d be useful to her in the future.Shen Yanxiao\u2019s \u2018abacus\u2019 echoed with \u2018ka\u2019 sounds as she calculated. She\u2019d already begun to evaluate her counterpart\u2019s worth of exploitation from these few words of dialogue, and was attempting to gain the biggest possibility of squeezing this counterpart clean.\u201cYou\u2019re actually taking good care of the business of our clan\u2019s auction house, it\u2019s just that, even now, I still don\u2019t know what to address you as\u2026 I\u2019m Qi Xia from the Qilin Clan, and you?\u201d Qi Xia beamingly looked at Shen Yanxiao.Qi Xia? From this period of time alone, Shen Yanxiao had actually heard more than a few matters pertaining to the other 4 big clans from Shen Siyu\u2019s mouth. It\u2019s said that the Qilin Clan was the fastest clan amongst the 5 large clans to establish their next clan head. And the person who\u2019d long ago established their identity as the heir to the Qilin Clan was precisely this youngster before her eyes, also known as Qi Xia.According to what Shen Siyu had said, Qi Xia\u2019s gift in the field of trading was enough to \u2018instant kill\u2019 all of the merchants in the Long Xuan Empire.After learning that the true identity of the youngster before her eyes was that of the future clan head of the Qilin Clan, Shen Yanxiao realized that what she\u2019d seen was already no longer simply an outstandingly handsome youngster, but had become a walking mountain of gold!\u201cI\u2019m Shen Jue.\u201dShen Jue was the identity that Shen Feng had arranged for Shen Yanxiao to have when she left for the Holy Roland School. The affair of Shen Yanxiao having her mentality restored was only known by the main branch of the Vermillion Bird Clan. Because of the matter with the Vermillion Bird, Shen Feng had sealed every single piece of information pertaining to Shen Yanxiao from outsiders. A specific unremarkable identity from the younger generation of the Vermillion Bird branch clan was even arranged and given to her for her entrance to the Holy Roland School.It was unavoidable that, at some point in the future, she\u2019d meet Qi Xia in the Holy Roland School, so Shen Yanxiao naturally knew what to say.\u201cTwo days from now, it\u2019ll be the start of a new term\u2014if there\u2019s anything that you\u2019re unused to in school, you can find me.\u201d Qi Xia magnanimously opened his mouth.\u201cIf that\u2019s so, thanks a lot.\u201d Shen Yanxiao naturally wouldn\u2019t be modest.\u201cWhich branch of the institution are you preparing to enter for the examination?\u201d Qi Xia smiled as he asked.\u201cThe pharmaceutical branch.\u201d Shen Yanxiao didn\u2019t have anything to hide.After blanking for a while, Qi Xia then smiled and said, \u201cA pharmacist will be very well-received. I\u2019m looking forward to you someday becoming a high level pharmacist. When that happens, do remember to prioritize delivering your medicine to the Qilin Auction House. I guarantee that you\u2019ll be given a very satisfactory price.\u201d\u201cOf course, I will naturally do so.\u201d Shen Yanxiao smiled as she answered.The two exchanged a burst of conventional greetings, and Qi Meng, who was to the side, didn\u2019t dare to utter a word. Even if he were to think until his mind broke, he couldn\u2019t understand what was going on with his own clan\u2019s youngster, why he was treating this ordinary customer this well. Previously, when Qi Xia had had him pay attention to this customer, he\u2019d already felt very weird. And now, he\u2019d unexpectedly still spoken about wanting to looking after his counterpart. This was simply unimaginable.Although right now, most pharmacists were mighty figures that no one dared to approach, what kind of status did the Qilin Clan have? There were so many pharmacists that wanted to serve the Qilin Clan, that even low level pharmacists weren\u2019t able to pass through the Qilin Clan\u2019s threshold. This little customer was so young, and still hadn\u2019t even entered into the pharmaceutical branch of the Holy Roland School. And yet, the young master was already this polite to her\u2014it truly went against the third young master\u2019s usual style.Who knew what this little customer would develop into? Even if the third young master wanted to invest in someone with good prospects, this was unavoidably still too unreasonable.Although Qi Meng had his own heartfelt opinions towards her, he didn\u2019t speak them out, and could only stand to the side, and listen in a well-behaved manner.Liked it?

On the same day that Shen Yanxiao was about to set out to leave for the Holy Roland School, the two brats, Shen Jiayi and Shen Jiawei, were also setting off. They\u2019d already entered the magic and Dou Qi branches of the Holy Roland School as early as a year ago. However, because they hadn\u2019t broken through to the 6th rank yet, they were currently still stuck within the outermost circle of the two branches. The pharmaceutical branch that Shen Yanxiao wanted to enter this time was located within the core position of the Holy Roland School, and there was a certain amount of distance between the branches that those two brats were located within and the one she was attempting to enter. Shen Feng didn\u2019t wish for Shen Yanxiao to receive too much attention, therefore he had the carriage that she was actually riding on leave first.The Holy Roland School would enroll new students during each spring and autumn, and during these periods of time, there\u2019d certainly be a burst of popular craze in the Long Xuan Empire.The enrollment session this fall had brought in quite a large quantity of students that wanted to enter the Holy Roland School. There were countless carriages before the entrance of the Holy Roland School, in fact it was so cramped that not even a drop of water would be able to trickle through the entrance of the school. The students that were currently bustling with activity were like densely packed ants as they walked on the public square of the Holy Roland School.\u201cHey, did you hear? This year, the young master of the Black Tortoise Clan has come once again.\u201d A few students that wanted to participate in the entrance exam were bored from the wait, and were gossiping together.\u201cHe truly is unresigned. How many times has it been now? He should\u2019ve turned 16 this year, right? I remember that he first began continuously wanting to enter the pharmaceutical branch of the Holy Roland Scholl when he was 14 years old. It\u2019s already been 2 years, and there still hasn\u2019t been a single time that he\u2019s passed despite take the exam four times. It should be his fifth time taking it this time, right? And yet he still hasn\u2019t given up?\u201d\u201cAiyo, it isn\u2019t like you don\u2019t know. Of the 5 large clans, there\u2019s only that youngster from the Black Tortoise Clan who\u2019s continuously been unable to pass the exam, and the Black Tortoise Clan certainly felt that it was losing face. Only because of that, did they allow him to repeat the exam again and again.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re correct, ah. I\u2019ve heard that both the Vermillion Bird Clan\u2019s youngest young master and young lady have already been admitted into the magic branch and Dou Qi branch. As of now, there\u2019s only the that small young master of the Black Tortoise Clan still left stuck at the entrance exam. Why is he still taking things too hard on himself\u2014still being insistent on entering the pharmaceutical branch and not taking any other entrance exam? If he relies on the Black Tortoise Clan\u2019s strength, entering one of the other branches shouldn\u2019t be impossible.\u201d\u201cWho knows? However, within the 5 large clans, it seems like there still hasn\u2019t been anyone that\u2019s passed the exam to enter the pharmaceutical branch\u2014this move of his is a risky approach.\u201cWait a minute\u2026why do I seem to remember that, within the 5 large clans, apart from that youngster, there\u2019s still another person that isn\u2019t in the Holy Roland School?\u201d\u201cHaha, you wouldn\u2019t be thinking of that disgrace from the Vermillion Bird Clan? Stop teasing us already, who doesn\u2019t know of that girl who\u2019s both not only trash, but is also an idiot. Let\u2019s not even mention her entering the few main branches of the institution, for even the subsidiary branches of magic and Dou Qi are too much for her right? Is it possible that you\u2019re actually hoping for the people from the Vermillion Bird Clan to let out that idiot to lose face?A group of new students were happily gossiping about the 5 large clans, and had most of their attention was focused around the Long Xuan Empire. A petite figure was silently standing near them, and as the figure was listening to the gossip that was coming out of their mouths, a completely amiable smiling expression appeared on the mediocre face present.\u201cIs the pharmaceutical branch that hard to enter?\u201d The person that had been standing to the side all along, listening to the gossip, suddenly asked.The group of gossipy students had only just now taken notice of the fact that there was unexpectedly a little bastard at their side.Just when had this person gotten here?

After sizing the young person in front of them updown, they saw that the counterpart\u2019s appearance not only didn\u2019t have any distinctive features\u2014which in turn didn\u2019t even draw the slightest bit of other\u2019s attention\u2014but that even the adolescent\u2019s clothes were extremely common.

As they were confronting someone that seemed so much like a youngster that had came from a poor clan, it was natural that they\u2019d have a sort of spontaneous haughtiness.\u201cWhat you\u2019re asking is certainly quite odd, for who wouldn\u2019t know that the pharmaceutical branch from the Holy Roland School is already extremely well-known for its difficult exam.

You have to realize that the pharmaceutical branch here has also fostered numerous high level pharmacist of our own country. So, how could it be possible for anyone to just be able to enter the Holy Roland School just like that.\u201d A youngster that was rather arrogant opened his mouth and said.The thing that had the highest reputation within the Holy Roland School was precisely the pharmaceutical branch. The requirements to nurture a pharmacist to a certain level were far more challenging compared to other schools of talents. If one wanted to fully nurture an outstanding pharmacist, not only was the pharmacist\u2019s own gift in the field needed, but the pharmacist also needed a formidable force backing them.Before the pharmacist became famous, the cost of refining medicines was astronomical. There was no need to speak about an ordinary household\u2019s income, for even if it was a rich clan, it\u2019d still be an extremely economically challenging thing for the said clan to provide and raise a pharmacist.The accumulation of all the costs needed for the equipment used in refining, combined with the necessary herbs\u2026 simply wasn\u2019t a value that an average person was capable of paying.Everyone knew that a low level pharmacist was already capable of generating a certain amount of wealth, but they also knew that, if one wanted to rise from an apprentice pharmacist to a low-level pharmacist, the amount of money one needed was enormous. Rather than say that a pharmacist is a money-making profession, it\u2019d actually be better to say that it\u2019s one that forcibly obtains money, and grinds out talent in return.One of the main reasons pharmacists were so scarce was because the actual cost required to raise one was was large enough that caused a great majority of people to be intimidated at simply the first glance.The knowledge that was to be ground out, depended on the financial grindstone that was employed. This sentence was practically tailored for the pharmacists.It was hard to blame these few adolescents for looking down upon the small destitute bastard in front of them, because no matter which aspect they saw it from, it was unlikely that this kind of person would become their future classmate. In the Holy Roland School, there wasn\u2019t anyone that had come from a poor family.Although this small adolescent in front of them didn\u2019t seem particularly poverty-stricken, the clothes on his body seemed to be on the same level as their clans\u2019 servants. Therefore, how could this adolescent afford the tuition fee?People like this, who were unexpectedly still overestimating their capabilities by inquiring about the pharmaceutical branch, were simply just a joke.\u201cYou aren\u2019t actually thinking of taking the entrance exam for the pharmaceutical branch, right?\u201d Those few adolescents sniggering as they looked at a certain person who seemed to be overestimating his capabilities.The tiny small adolescent in front them smiled and nodded. The extremely genuine smiling expression actually added a hint of gentleness to his facial features.\u201cHaha, this is the funniest joke that I\u2019ve heard of this year. Boy, do you know how much a the tuition fee for a year in the pharmaceutical branch is? Even if you sold your entire family, you still wouldn\u2019t be able to afford it. You should pack up that unrealistic expectation of yours early, and turn back.\u201dThe adolescents\u2019 ridicule wasn\u2019t masked in the least, for they simply didn\u2019t care about the reaction of a commoner.The small adolescent that was standing near them and being ridiculed was actually touching his nose.He couldn\u2019t afford it, even if he sold his entire family?He really wasn\u2019t sure how much money he\u2019d get from selling off everyone within the Vermillion Bird Clan.Liked it?

Before she\u2019d departed, she\u2019d intentionally allowed Shen Feng to have the luxurious carriage changed into a common carriage, and to have her entire set of gorgeous clothes to be changed to ones made of ordinary material. Even her identity had been changed: from a young lady that hadn\u2019t yet grown up, to a half-mature adolescent boy. The retinue that Shen Feng had originally wanted to dispatch with her was also left behind by her at the Vermillion Bird Clan.It was very evident that Shen Yanxiao\u2019s excessively low-profile outfit made her become an existence that was both warm and affable to the eyes of some people.If the adolescents in front of her knew that the person they were ridiculing was actually the next clan leader of the Vermillion Bird Clan, it\u2019s very likely that they\u2019d\u2019ve long ago pissed their pants in terror.Who would\u2019ve thought that the heir of one of the 5 grand large clans would dress up like a commoner, and appear at the Holy Roland School\u2019s enrollment site?However, the current Shen Yanxiao certainly didn\u2019t have the mood to bother these few ignorant and narrow-minded brats. Faced with their ridicule, she simply treated it as the stupidity of ignorant fools. After asking for a while about the location she should go to in order to enroll in the pharmaceutical branch, she made her way thereIt was just as those few youngsters had said; if one desired to be a pharmaceutical student, one had to be extremely wealthy. As for the students that were currently enrolling for the pharmaceutical branch, all of them were wearing brocade and flowery clothing. The degree of the displayed lavishness could be compared to a modern era fashion show conference.These new students all seemed to itch to have their entire bodies fully covered with luxury goods\u2014precious stones that flickered with lustre, and dazzling and flashing golden ornaments capable of blinding people were used to flaunt their respected clan\u2019s robust strength in that their respected clans could afford to entirely use money to grind out a pharmacist.Confronting the group of adolescents that were intimidatingly rich like this, Shen Yanxiao\u2019s hand had become\u2026itchy.Fat lambs! Fat lambs everywhere!!To put an exceptional godly thief like her into a group of disciples from wealthy clans that weren\u2019t the least bit guarded against her\u2026 was equal to having a rat that was always hungry and throwing it into a jar.Rather than having repressed desires, she might as well make a move. Shen Yanxiao immediately tilted her head down, and then began to shuttle through the crowded tide of people.As a result of a certain someone being excessively low-key, everyone that was currently present simply didn\u2019t take note of the unprepossessing ugly-duckling-like existence, as all of them were all still minding their own business as they waited for the test to start. Most scarcely realised that the purse that\u2018d been on their waists had long disappeared, along with the heartless little thief, without a trace. The luxury goods that had been on their wrists had already eloped from their persons as well.Money is an inherently good thing. No matter how much more there was, there wouldn\u2019t be anyone that\u2019d avoid it out of dislike.The pharmaceutical branch\u2019s exam had continuously and unceasingly continued onwards, but when confronted with up to several thousands of new students, the testing speed could practically be considered negligible.This also gave a certain person enough time to make a move on this giant group of fat sheep.Shen Yanxiao had already returned from the upsurging crowd without spending much effort, and her storage ring was once again crammed with gold coins, which had been consumed from paying Qi Meng.There was only one word to describe this feeling from returning from a rewarding journey: pleasurable!It wasn\u2019t until afternoon that there was finally some progress in the line, where people were waiting to enroll in the pharmaceutical branch.Only after being certain that she was no longer able to take any more things, did she stand in line to wait for the exam in a well-behaved manner.Not long afterwards, she was at the forefront of the line; the place where the pharmaceutical branch was currently enrolling new students. Tens of the school\u2019s tutors were setting up batch after batch of the school\u2019s test.Of the group of tutors, the one that was in charge of Shen Yanxiao was a middle-aged male with an exceedingly solemn appearance. After glancing over the current batch of new students that were standing before him, he easily chose over twenty people, Shen Yanxiao included.\u201cAll of you follow me.\u201dAfter saying that, he turned around and walked over to the entrance exam hall.Liked it?

There were also five more batches of students that entered together with Shen Yanxiao\u2019s batch. They were all separately brought to places that were pre-partitioned long ago, in order to carry out the contents of this test.Shen Yanxiao\u2019s group was brought before a row of tables that had all sorts of things laid out on it.\u201cNow, I shall demonstrate the method to make a clear-headed medicine all the way through only once. Do you all have the self-confidence to see it all the way through?\u201d The expressionless tutor said, before immediately starting to work with the medicine refinement tools before him. The pure sparkling crystal bottle that was within his fingertips, along with one medicine herb after another, was rapidly refined by him into a half-filled bottle full of a dark-green medicinal solution. He carried out the process step by step. The twenty plus students gazed steadily at the tutor\u2019s each and every movements, deeply fearing that they\u2019d miss out on just a tiny bit.After several minutes, a perfect first-rate clear-headed medicine appeared before their eyes.\u201cNow then, all of you have thirty minutes of time to work it out. After thirty minutes, the people that have passed will remain, and the people that don\u2019t pass are to immediately leave the Holy Roland School.\u201d The tutor\u2019s deep and low voice echoed.The twenty plus new students were immediately completely shocked.After one drill, he wanted them, this random group of people, to manufacture out the clear-headed medicine by themselves? This was a joke. Although the clear-headed medicine was said to be classified as one of the most simplest of all medicines, in regards to these new students who couldn\u2019t even be considered as apprentice pharmacists, this was simply them just running into misfortune.However, everyone knew that the Holy Roland School\u2019s examination had always been something this sick. They didn\u2019t dare to retort, and only strived to rely on their memories in order to test out their fortune.As soon as the tutor\u2019s words were said, the twenty plus new students immediately gathered before the pile of medicine refinement wares, and began to turn them upside down.All of the herbs were already properly placed on the side, they only needed to operate in accordance with what the tutor had done just now, that was all.A dream was awfully ample, but reality was awfully bony.Him only demonstrating once simply wasn\u2019t enough for them to have distinctly remembered every single detail, and a great majority of them, in quick succession, had huge errors appear as they started to work. However, in order for them to enter the pharmaceutical branch, they could only brace themselves, and continue on with their work. In any case, everyone\u2019s standards were pretty much the same anyway. No matter if it they were right or wrong, so long as they followed the tutor\u2019s words and continued on to complete it, it was alright\u2014even if the one they made wasn\u2019t successful. The others, however, weren\u2019t getting anywhere. As long as the one that they\u2019d made was slightly better when compared to the others, then it was alright, for they didn\u2019t believe that the tutor could still have all twenty plus of them kicked out at once.Lou De was standing to the side as he watched this batch of new students, who were repeating the manufacturing work he\u2019d just done in the least possible order of manner. He tightly locked up the wrinkle in his brows from getting any deeper. Although these new students were already striving to clearly figure out what they\u2019d just seen, when they\u2019d actually started doing it, it was still a spectacle too horrible for him to endure.Suddenly, Lou De discovered something very interesting.During the time where all of the new students had been occupied with moving the wares that were in their hands back and forth, there was one person who stood motionless before the wares from start to finish.it was the little bastard who had both an extremely ordinary appearance, and a petite figure that was extremely unremarkable amongst everyone. He continuously stood before the table, as his quick-witted, large eyes looked here and there, at every kind of ware that was on the table, and yet, he didn\u2019t move his hands.Lou De raised his brows, but still didn\u2019t say anything, and only lifted his head to look at the time.The thirty minutes flashed by in the wink of an eye, and a great majority of the twenty plus youngsters had completed their entire work. However, the outcome they received was one that had people unable to bear looking at it.The clear-headed medicine that Lou De had manufactured was a pure dark-green colour, and didn\u2019t have a trace of impurity. Even if it was the simplest clear-headed medicine, it was sufficient enough to reflect his superlative skills in manufacturing medicine.Liked it?

If Lou De hadn\u2019t known that he\u2019d told them to manufacture the clear-headed medicine in advance, then he truly wouldn\u2019t have known just what these things held in this group of brats hands were.Of the group of youngsters, some of them were scared witless, for they too were clear about the state of these things that they\u2019d refined in a rush. There was no need to speak of helping each other, simply having no one poisoned to death was already an extremely fortunate thing.However, this couldn\u2019t be blamed on them either. Even if they were geniuses, it was still impossible for them to be able to perfectly complete the entire manufacturing process after seeing the counterpart\u2019s work only a single time.Everyone\u2019s attitude was simply \u2018you take a look at mine, and I\u2019ll take a look at yours\u2019. They were all paying quite a large amount of attention to each other\u2019s completed product. Luckily, a great majority of their results were all roughly the same: the spectacle was equally too horrible to endure.As the saying goes, the law cannot punish the many. They were somewhat gratified.Actually, there was one person\u2019s circumstances that caused everyone to expose a trace of a smile on their face.My goodness! Within this group of theirs, there was unexpectedly a fool who hadn\u2019t even manufactured anything. Just looking at the wares that hadn\u2019t been moved at all, and those intact herbs on the table, they knew right away that the poor youngster simply hadn\u2019t done anything. At this moment, everyone was sniggering, for although they hadn\u2019t been successful, they could still be considered to have imitated the tutor\u2019s manufacturing process, and had displayed their memorization ability. That youngster had had no other choice but to not manufacture anything, and they reckoned that the youngster simply hadn\u2019t memorized the tutor\u2019s movements, thus having no way to start manufacturing.Under such an intense contrast, the youngsters who\u2019d been originally incomparably dispirited over their finished products were immediately filled with confidence in themselves.Lou De swept a glance over the unknown objects that were held within everyone\u2019s hands, before his severe gaze finally fell onto the little guy\u2019s body, whom hadn\u2019t done anything.\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d Lou De asked.\u201cShen Jue.\u201d Shen Yanxiao beamingly replied.All of the new students who were to the side were inwardly howling with laughter, could it be that this foolish youngster couldn\u2019t see just how unsightly the tutor\u2019s complexion was? And yet, he still unexpectedly still able to smile!After taking a glance at the neat surface of the table behind Shen Yanxiao, Lou De asked, \u201cShen Jue, why didn\u2019t you refine the clear-headed medicine in accordance with the request?\u201dShen Yanxiao touched the tip of her nose then, shooting a glance at the few whole and intact herbs that were present on the table, she said, \u201cTeacher, that\u2019s because you simply didn\u2019t give me the right herbs to manufacture the clear-headed medicine.\u201dLou De\u2019s complexion slightly changed, and the twenty plus new students that were on the side all bolted over.Shen Yanxiao pointed at the herbs that were on the table and said, \u201cTeacher, although the herbs that you used just now looked very similar to these, there were nevertheless subtle differences. Although the herbs that teacher used to manufacture the clear-headed medicine and the herbs present on the tables are both leaves that are slender type, the leaves that the teacher used had teeth-like edges that are like a sword, but these herbs present on the table have teeth-like edges that are more smooth and round. Although the difference is very subtle, they nevertheless are completely different.\u201dAfter Shen Yanxiao\u2019s spoke, the new students immediately turned around and looked at the herbs that were left-over, and sure enough, the edges of the were relatively smooth and round. They then immediately turned to take a look at Lou De\u2019s left-over herbs, and sure enough, the edges of his were a sharp, gear-like shape. These herb\u2019s leaves were merely the width of a pinkie, and the shape of the edges were also extremely subtle. If one didn\u2019t pay attention, then there would simply be no one who\u2019d discover such a minute differenceAfter realising that this small adolescent\u2019s words were true, the twenty plus new students\u2019 complexion momentarily became unsightly.All of them had come here to participate in the entrance exam for the pharmaceutical branch, therefore they\u2019d definitely done a lot of studying prior to the exam. Although they were still unable to independently complete the refinement of medicine, they still had some understanding in regards to the most fundamental herbs.Liked it?

Therefore, when they\u2019d been watching Lou De manufacture the medicine, much more of their attention had been focused on Lou De\u2019s manufacturing process, thus no one had taken note of the Cedar RIver Grass, this sort of herb that they already knew of.However, concerning what they knew, there was still another kind of herb that had an exceedingly close resemblance with the Cedar River Grass, and that was precisely the Cold Black Jade Grass.The Cold Black Jade Grass had an extremely similar appearance with the Cedar River Grass, but their purposes were as different as heaven and earth. Moreover, the Cold Black Jade Grass wasn\u2019t as common as the Cedar River Grass. Therefore, a great majority of people had only seen a drawing of the Cold Black Jade from an herbal book.Furthermore, they\u2019d also believed that Lou De had been testing their standards in manufacturing medicine and memorization ability this time. Therefore, they simply hadn\u2019t thought that the herbs, which had been prepared long ago, would be the thing to have a problem arise. What\u2019s more was that the Cold Black Jade Grass originally looked the same as the Cedar River Grass, thus they\u2019d just carelessly used the herbs.All of the new students\u2019 complexion momentarily became extremely unsightly. As they looked at the medicine that was within their own hands, they became so ashamed that they couldn\u2019t even lift their heads up.Lou De looked satisfiedly at the unprepossessing new student, for he was very satisfied in regards to his act of observing the subtlety.\u201cNot bad. As a pharmacist, being careful is precisely the basic thing for the medicine that you all are to manufacture in the future, which is to be taken by other people. If one isn\u2019t careful, it\u2019s very probable that it\u2019d bring about an immense harm to the one that takes the medicine. The test this time was precisely for the purpose of seeing whether or not you all were able to calmly observe the difference between the two herbs, but the outcome was very obvious. All of you simply didn\u2019t discover that the herbs placed on your tables really weren\u2019t Cedar River Grass.\u201dLou De\u2019s words had everyone\u2019s hearts keyed up. A few of the new students whom were unresigned immediately struggled as they said, \u201cTeacher, I had actually also discovered that this thing was the Cold Black Jade Grass, it\u2019s just that you said that you wanted us to refine the clear-headed medicine. Therefore, I just wanted to study your technique for a while on how to make it.\u201dThe way to exculpate themselves was already opened, and a great majority of the new students began to give themselves this kind of an excuse.In any case, they previously hadn\u2019t said that the herb within their hands was Cedar River Grass, and the tutor also didn\u2019t know that they simply hadn\u2019t discovered the differences between the two herbs, so they could bluff their way out.Lou De sneered, and the appearance that was originally already very dignified appeared to radiate an even more stern aura.\u201cWhat a joke! As a pharmacist, under the circumstances where you clearly know that the herbs were incorrect, you still continued refining something that was impossible to be completed, this is simply an even bigger mistake for not researching the root of the mistake. Instead, after you noticed it, you still continued working on the error! This is even more inexcusable compared to not being careful!\u201dA pharmacist was a profession that was related to other people\u2019s life and death, so it was intolerable to have even a tiny bit of error. Lou De simply didn\u2019t dare to believe that these youngsters unexpectedly still dared to find such an excuse. This simply made people find it harder to excuse compared to them not finding the differences between the Cold Black Jade Grass and the Cedar River Grass!The group of new students whom had attempted to redeem their situation were fiercely scolded by Lou De that their want to make a stand and fight against anything again was already to no avail. Of the twenty plus exam candidates, the only one that remained was Shen Yanxiao, the one who hadn\u2019t moved her hands from the start to finish, while the others were judged to have not passed the test. Dejectedly, they left the entrance exam hall.Shen Yanxiao stood at her original spot as she saw off the other exam candidates who were currently leaving the hall with unwillingness in their hearts.Lou De stood at Shen Yanxiao\u2019s side, and his face that had been taut all along became somewhat softer by a bit.\u201cYou\u2019ve done very well, for after you discovered the differences between the two, you didn\u2019t rashly proceed with the operation. This is one of the doctrines as a pharmacist. Congratulations, for you have become a member of the Holy Roland School\u2019s pharmaceutical branch \u201c Towards the one that had high perception, Lou De would be more benevolent.Liked it?

She just hadn\u2019t known how to use the medicine refinement wares!In fact, although the exam candidates that had been driven out by Lou De were too sluggish in their observation, they had all more or less spent a large margin of effort towards preparing themselves. From the way that they\u2019d worked with the different kinds of wares that they were familiar with, one could just see that they knew a thing or two even before they\u2019d taken part in the entrance exam, and that they\u2019d already more or less established a sort of pharmacist\u2019s foundation.Compared to them, Shen Yanxiao was a complete layman!Although the Vermillion Bird Clan was domineering, they still didn\u2019t have a pharmacist that they could wantonly take out. Shen Feng had wanted to find someone who could give her an exam-cramming session, but there simply hadn\u2019t been a suitable candidate.It wasn\u2019t that she didn\u2019t want to refine medicine rather, she simply didn\u2019t know how. Although Lou De had fully demonstrated it once, and even though Shen Yanxiao had roughly memorised it, she was still completely ignorant regarding the use of the alchemical wares.She certainly didn\u2019t wish to cause an explosion, and because of that single bit of carelessness of hers, have no fate with the pharmaceutical branch.She\u2019d only discovered the differences between the two herbs on a whim. In fact, she hadn\u2019t even known what those two herbs were called from the start, as to her, they merely looked different, that was all!She was akin to a blind cat finding a dead mouse. She hadn\u2019t expected pretending to be unperturbed would end up with her passing the pharmaceutical branch\u2019s exam. Shen Yanxiao truly didn\u2019t know whether she should laugh or cry.On the surface, she was still incomparably unperturbed as she received Lou De\u2019s praising gaze, but in Shen Yanxiao\u2019s mind, she secretly swore that, before she was discovered by the others, she\u2019d think of a way to make it so that she thoroughly understood the fundamentals of a pharmacist refining medicine!\u201cLou De, this last batch of mine was another complete failure. How was it on your side?\u201d The tutor that was in charge of another batch of exam candidates took advantage of the short period of resting time after the conclusion had been drawn, and went to Lou De\u2019s side to ask.Lou De pointed at Shen Yanxiao, whom was at his side, and said, \u201cIt\u2019s was okay, of this last batch, only this youngster remained.\u201dChuckling, the tutor looked at Shen Yanxiao and said, \u201cNot bad. You have to know that the contents of the tests that Lou De is in charge of are indeed the most sick and you, a youngster, have unexpectedly satisfied him\u2014extraordinary.\u201dLou De pretended to consciously snort as he said, \u201cThat\u2019s because they were too stupid. They weren\u2019t even able to satisfy one of the pharmacist\u2019s fundamental conditions, and yet they had the wishful thoughts of becoming pharmacists?\u201d While he was saying this, Lou De glanced at Shen Yanxiao, and a bit of satisfaction appeared in his eyes.\u201cThis youngster can still be considered to be not bad, for not only does he have a sharp eye, but he\u2019s also very attentive in his observation. What\u2019s rare is that he\u2019s already begun following the pharmacist\u2019s most important doctrine already. Someday in the future, after he\u2019s been finely tempered, he\u2019ll certainly have some extent of accomplishment.\u201dThe two tutors were jumping in in the discussion with their opinions of all kinds of earth-shattering praises, all smashing towards Shen Yanxiao. Shen Yanxiao could only continue on maintaining the Mona Lisa smile on her face, and she could only \u2018modestly\u2019 receive these various kinds of praise.However, she also took note of the fact that, although quite a few batches of exam candidates had been arranged for examination within the same entrance exam hall, there was only one exam candidate from the final batch left besides her within the entire entrance exam hall after the conclusion of the exam.Of the hundred plus people that had taken the exam, only two people had passed the entrance exam in the end.This was just how sick the Holy Roland School\u2019s pharmaceutical branch\u2019s exam was!! It was no wonder that those people had said that the exam here was known to be difficult.It\u2019s estimated that, of the thousand plus people that had come for this fall\u2019s enrollment, at most, there\u2019d only be several tens of people that would remain\u2014that was it.This kind of savage recruitment rate was even more frightening than the college entrance exam of modern times!Liked it?

Only after that, did he allow for Shen Yanxiao to be brought to the new student dormitory, where she would be arranged to stay.As Shen Yanxiao walked out from the entrance exam hall, she gazed out at the lines of exam candidates which were still tremendously long, and she silently drew a cross for them in her heart.

Therefore, just how did that little demon pass like this?!\u201dOnce they thought of the past, where they themselves had laughed at the counterpart for simple wishful thinking, they were itching to immediately find a crack in the reality presented to them and bore into it. This kind of face-slapping feeling had it where they didn\u2019t dare to take more than a single glance.It was still a question as to whether or not they themselves could pass their exams, and in the end, that poor adolescent that they hadn\u2019t thought highly of, in various ways, had unexpectedly smoothly passed.This kind of intense contrast simply made people want to vomit blood!\u201cJust because he\u2019s passed, doesn\u2019t necessary mean that he\u2019ll be able to attend classes, for he has to be able to afford the tuition fee. Only then will he be able to stay at the Holy Roland School.\u201d Unable to endure this kind of discrepancy, there was an adolescent who couldn\u2019t help but begin to look for a pretext to placate himself with.\u201cSeeing how he\u2019s dressed, it\u2019s a definite thing that he\u2019ll be unable to afford it.\u201d\u201cPrecisely!\u201dAfter finding a way to reassure themselves, the group of adolescents immediately reassumed their vigorousness and liveliness that they\u2019d previously had. As before, they stood within the extremely long line, waiting for their own test to come.In any case, as long as they were able to pass, they\u2019d certainly be able to afford the tuition fee!They reassured themselves in this way\u2026\u2026The dorm that Shen Yanxiao was assigned to was located to the southeast of the pharmaceutical branch. The white-coloured dormitory closely resembled the European style buildings of olden times, from her previous life. Accurately speaking, the entire Holy Roland School resembled an ancient, yet gorgeous, palace of the Western country.Shen Yanxiao\u2019s room was on the third floor of the new student\u2019s dormitory, and within each room would be three new students. Apart from the three large beds within the extremely spacious room, there were also three extremely refined long tables. There were also cupboards that would be laid down on both sides of the long table, which were used to lay out both the books and the wares that were actually needed in the refining of medicine.The room\u2019s number was 305. When Shen Yanxiao entered the room, she discovered that her other roommates were already making their beds.Upon seeing Shen Yanxiao, one of the youngsters whom was of a small build immediately produced a very genuine smiling expression as he walked over.\u201cHello, I\u2019m Lin Xuan. Later on, we\u2019ll be classmates within the same dorm, so please treat me kindly.\u201d Adding that pure smiling expression to that fair and handsome face, it was very easy for people to have favourable impressions towards him.The feeling that Lin Xuan gave to Shen Yanxiao very closely resembled that of a conscientious yet diligent model student. During the next two to three years, she\u2019d have to live together with this kind of model student. Shen Yanxiao very courteously smiled as she said, \u201cHello, I\u2019m Shen Jue.\u201dLiked it?

Lin Xuan quite good-naturedly helped Shen Yanxiao sort out her stuff.Of the three-person dorm room, one of her roommates was an \u2018obedient child\u2019 clich\u00e9 and as of the other one\u2026Shen Yanxiao looked towards the slim-figured adolescent whom had simply been laying on the bed all along, browsing the pharmaceutical book that he was holding ever since she\u2019d entered. Although he\u2019d been extremely serious towards fixing his attention onto the book in his hands, Shen Yanxiao was truly unable to treat him as that kind of good, studious student.Where did there exist a bookworm that would wear a high-top horse-skinned shoe, and lie on his bed with his legs crossed?The adolescent\u2019s appearance was extremely outstanding. The wheat-coloured skin was matched by a pair of eyes that were as sharp as a falcon\u2019s. Even if he were merely laying down on the bed, it nevertheless caused people to perceive his unrestrained-ness.\u201cHe\u2019s Tang Nazhi\u2014one of the youngest young masters of the Black Tortoise Clan, which is one of the big five clans.\u201d Lin Xuan had taken notice of Shen Yanxiao\u2019s line of sight, and with good intentions, opened his mouth and said.The Black Tortoise Clan\u2019s young master? Shen Yanxiao slightly raised her eyebrows, for she still remembered what she\u2019d previously heard, more than a few pieces of information pertaining to this dear friend from those gossiping youngsters\u2014this guy who suffered defeat in every battle, yet had regarded the pharmaceutical branch as his own lifelong target.It seemed that Tang Nazhi\u2019s luck this year wasn\u2019t bad, for he\u2019d finally been able to pass the pharmaceutical branch\u2019s exam.In fact, it really wasn\u2019t that Shen Yanxiao didn\u2019t know anything at all about Tang Nazhi. After all, she too had once gone to the Black Tortoise Clan during that period of time, in order to \u2018gather\u2019 funds; so long as it was a room with an important member of the Black Tortoise Clan, everything would be \u2018gathered\u2019 by her in passing. Merely, she didn\u2019t know what things she\u2019d taken from Tang Nazhi at that time.Although she\u2019d concealed a certain identity of hers for her arrival at the Holy Roland School this time, she still had the identity of a branch member of the Vermillion Bird Clan. The interrelationships between the big 5 clans were very subtle, and as of now, she was unexpectedly allocated to a dorm room with a gentleman like this. She herself didn\u2019t know whether any issues would rise up someday in the future.As if he\u2019d perceived Shen Yanxiao\u2019s line of sight Tang Nazhi, who\u2019d been burying his head in a book all along, lifted his head up. Slightly facing his chin upwards, he looked at his two lightly-built roommates. His pair of eagle-like eyes caused Lin Xuan to subconsciously pull back his head.Tang Nazhi\u2019s gaze slightly paused for a moment when it fell upon Shen Yanxiao\u2019s body. Immediately, he raised his eyebrows, and suddenly stood up from the bed. With large strides, he walked towards the two roommates of his.Lin Xuan stared at Tang Nazhi who was gradually approaching, and his legs couldn\u2019t help but slightly tremble.Rumour had it that this young master\u2019s temperament wasn\u2019t that good. Although his own family circumstances were pretty good, in the presence of the Black Tortoise Clan, he was akin an ant. He could only silently pray that this young master from the Black Tortoise Clan hadn\u2019t come looking for trouble with him.Tang Nazhi\u2019s footsteps halted in front of Shen Yanxiao. He was obviously merely a sixteen years old adolescent. However, standing before the thirteen years old Shen Yanxiao, he was nevertheless taller than Shen Yanxiao by a full one and a half heads. His pair of sharp eyes that were brimming with unruliness towered above as they gazed at Shen Yanxiao.\u201cI recognise you.\u201d Staring at Shen Yanxiao, Tang Nazhi said. That wild and unruly voice was exactly like the impression that he gave people.\u201cOh?\u201d Shen Yanxiao was considering a method to get along with Tang Nazhi, for what she\u2019d come at the Holy Roland School wasn\u2019t only the pharmaceutical branch She was still hoping that someday in the future she could slip into the other branches in order to steal the fundamental books of the archer and warlock specializations, thus she certainly didn\u2019t want to create some sort of disagreement with this young man.Scuffling was a small matter, but if it was to delay her in advancing in rank, Xiu would indeed go ballistic.Liked it?

However, at the time, she simply hadn\u2019t taken note of who the other person that\u2019d passed the exam was.Could it be that that person had been Tang Nazhi?He\u2019d heard Tutor Lou De\u2019s praise towards herself, and thus, he was discontented?If it was truly this, then Tang Nazhi\u2019s mentality would be easy to explain. The disciples of the five big clans had always been extremely conceited, so how would they allow others to be much stronger than them, and even be of more importance to the tutor? It seemed that Tang Nazhi was planning to look for trouble.Just as Shen Yanxiao had been analyzing Tang Nazhi\u2019s mentality, Tang Nazhi suddenly lifted his palm and directly sent out an attack towards Shen YanxiaoSeeing that Tang Nazhi was about to beat Shen Yanxiao up, Lin Xuan cried out in fear.Shen Yanxiao mentally spurred the Dou Qi within her body so that she could give this mad gentleman, who didn\u2019t seem to know east, south, west, or north, a lesson.However, his sturdy and large palm unexpectedly fell onto Shen Yanxiao\u2019s shoulder. A smear of an exceedingly earnest expression suddenly appeared on Tang Nazhi\u2019s unconstrained face. With extreme seriousness, he opened his mouth and said, \u201cPlease give me some advice someday in the future regarding the matter of pharmacology!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Shen Yanxiao was dumbstruck.Where was the feeling of them not seeing eye to eye that was properly discussed of? Where was the unfolding path of a rival classmate?It was as if Tang Nazhi hadn\u2019t the slightest idea that Shen Yanxiao had been thunderstruck by his words until her outsides were scorched and her insides tender. Minding his own business, he held up the pharmacology book with both of his hands and placed it before Shen Yanxiao\u2019s eyes. With awful seriousness, he said, \u201cWe\u2019re already roommates as of now. As both a classmate and a comrade of the same dorm, we should know how to mutually help and learn from one another. Someday in the future, if there\u2019s a question that I don\u2019t understand in the pharmaceutical field, I do hope that you\u2019ll help me answer it. Of course, if there were any scoundrels that didn\u2019t open their eyes and wanted to bully you inside this school, you can inform me, and I\u2019ll make absolutely sure that that person is beaten up until he\u2019s looking for his teeth all over the floor!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d What the heck are you talking about!Even if she were to dream of it, Shen Yanxiao, who was originally taking full precautions to battle with Tang Nazhi, would have never anticipate that this youngster, who\u2019d seemed incessantly haughty, would unexpectedly run and discuss camaraderie with her, this kind of healthy and pure topic. This had Shen Yanxiao, who had a somewhat twisted worldview, find it extremely hard to digest.\u201cYour things haven\u2019t been put completely in order, yet? You, there! Follow me and help her put her things in order properly!\u201d Tang Nazhi pointed at Lin Xuan, who was already thoroughly petrified and standing to the side, and instructed.Lin Xuan, who\u2019d been completely left out of having the equivalent \u2018roommate status\u2019 cried out with weeping face, and was filled with grievances by Tang Nazhi\u2019s slavery.Seeing such a huge disparity in Tang Nazhi\u2019s attitude towards him and Shen Jue, Lin Xuan simply wanted to cry, but there were no tears, for wasn\u2019t it properly said that they should mutually help and learn from one another? Why was it that when it reached him, it thoroughly became slavery!Shen Yanxiao, who was to the side, stared blankly. Seeing that Tang Nazhi was having Lin Xuan put her things in order, momentarily, she truly found it hard to accept this theatrical scene. How is it that, even though I\u2019m properly attending school, I\u2019ve suddenly encountered such an overly cordial roommate?However, it was very evident that a certain young master that had come from an influential clan didn\u2019t have any talent in regards to putting things in order. The luggage that was originally already a complete mess had become an even greater spectacle that was too horrible to endure under his \u2018evil clutches\u2019. Contrarily, the pitiful LIn Xuan could only silently continue his assignment of putting things in order under a certain person\u2019s arrogant gaze.Liked it?

Although he was still struggling with the pillow in his hand, a clear and bright smiling expression still hung on his face.This Shen Jue was much easier to get close to than he\u2019d imagined!In fact, right after Tang Nazhi had arrived at the dorm, he\u2019d already known the identities of his two future roommates of his. As for Lin Xan\u2019s identity, let\u2019s not talk about it for the time being, it was actually this youngster called Shen Jue that had drawn an enormous amount of his interest, for both he and Shen Jue took their entrance tests in the same entrance exam hall. Of the hundreds of people in the entire entrance exam hall, only the two of them had passed the exam.The Holy Roland School\u2019s pharmaceutical exam was usually so sick that it caused people to draw a blank, for he himself had also been rigidly oppressed till his face was as red as blood. Only this year, with great difficulty, and after using a few techniques, did he finally slip through. As for this little bastard called Shen Jue, unexpectedly, he\u2019d relied on his own genuine skill to pass through the test. Moreover, after the test had concluded, Tang Nazhi had clearly heard that Tutor Lou De, who was well-known to be strict, unexpectedly made an exception and praised this unprepossessing little bastard.To be able to cause that old fogey to nod his head and say more than a few words of praise, it was sufficient to show this little bastard\u2019s gift towards pharmacology.Tang Nazhi had then imprinted Shen Jue\u2019s name in his heart. Everyone knew that he had an obstinateness that exceeded that of the common people towards passing the pharmaceutical branch\u2019s exam. However, his target wasn\u2019t merely passing through the exam that was as simple as this. He still wanted to become an exceptional pharmacist, and properly have that group of scoundrels carefully take a look at his own ability.However, even if Tang Nazhi was obstinate, he wasn\u2019t an idiot. He himself had used a full two and half years, and only then, had he smoothly passed through the pharmaceutical branch\u2019s exam. This was sufficient to illustrate that his own talent towards pharmacology simply wasn\u2019t that much, thus he just had to find a classmate that excelled in both morals and studies to be his helper, so that he could reach the target that he wanted to!And, Shen Jue was precisely his number one choice!At such a young age, this little bastard had already obtained Lou De\u2019s recognition. It could be clearly seen that Shen Jue had a very high talent towards pharmacology. At the time when Shen Jue\u2019s group was taking the test, Tang Nazhi had also stealthily taken note of their test. Frankly, he also hadn\u2019t discovered that there had been a difference in the ingredients used!Witnessing Shen Jue\u2019s \u2018outstandingness\u2019, Tang Nazhi had immediately made preparations to rope Shen Jue in. In fact, even if Shen Jue was unwilling to helpful to him, Tang Nazhi would forcibly tie Shen Jue to his side!However, from what he\u2019d seen, this little bastard\u2019s temper was one that was easy to get along with. If that was so, so long as he had Shen Jue\u2019s assistance, he believed that he\u2019d very soon be able to bring about a quantitative leap in his pharmacology skills!The Holy Roland School\u2019s enrollment exam continued on for three days. Only then, was it over. The fellow students that were enrolled were in high spirits. As for the enormous majority of people that had the door shut in their face, each of them couldn\u2019t help but to dejectedly return to their homes, with each finding their mothers.Of this year\u2019s student enrollment period, the pharmaceutical branch had altogether gained a hundred and sixty three students, which was only one percent of the total number of people that had entered themselves for the examination.Shen Yanxiao had passed her exam on the first day, thus for the following two days, a great majority of her time was spent being dragged by Tang Nazhi to look at a few books pertaining to pharmacology. The contents of these books to her were just like a mysterious code. When she dismantled them into single characters, she recognised them, but when they were combined together, they were completely unfamiliar.She also didn\u2019t know where Tang Nazhi got the self-confidence to treat her as a genius in pharmacology. Frequently, he\u2019d point at some herbs\u2019 properties that were in the book, and would ask her some questions about them. Shen Yanxiao could only silently look at the herbs that she was seeing for the first time, and unperturbedly return a smile back to him. This young and vigorous youngster would then immediately be just as if he\u2019d been \u2018injected with chicken blood\u2019, and would excitedly burn the midnight oil.

Young master Tang had directly neglected his existence, while Shen Yanxiao was bothered by Tang Nazhi all day long, and was unable to get away from him. Night after night, the lamp was lit, which had also made Lin Xuan unable to sleep. He could only silently hold up a book with both of his hands, and stay before his table and gnaw it.Within the period of two days, there was already a rumour spreading in the new student\u2019s dorm!In the new student\u2019s dorm, in room 305, stayed three deranged bookworms!Pharmacology was a profession that was rather fierce in competition, and there\u2019d be a huge disparity in future business potential between the good and bad ones. The youngsters were originally still immersed in the fact that they\u2019d passed their exam, but right after they discovered that there were three bookworms that were so diligent it could raise people\u2019s hackles when it came to reading books on their own floor, the hot blood in them was immediately ignited.In order to be able to earn money to get a wife someday in the future, a group of young and vigorous youngsters began to exert their utmost strength, and buried their heads into pharmacology books.The entire new student dorm now reflected exceedingly strange circumstances. During the daytime, not one person of the new student\u2019s could be seen within the passageway, and just casually entering any one dorm room, one would also be able to see two to three new students burying their heads into the books\u2014bitterly studying.These kind of circumstances not only made the tutors\u2019 of the pharmaceutical branch pleased beyond their expectations, but had also even caused those seniors that had already entered the school to be under great pressure!Why was it that each and every one of this batch of new students were as if they didn\u2019t want to live anymore as they madly ate through their books? If it continued on like this, where would they, these seniors\u2019s, face belong?!A puff of invisible smoke quietly extended over the old and new students of the pharmaceutical branch.As for the main offenders who\u2019d directly brought about this situation, Shen Yanxiao and Tang Nazhi, they were nevertheless unaware in the least about this.It wasn\u2019t until the first day after the conclusion of the three days long of enrollment exam, when it was the group placement exam, that they sensed a trace of difference.The two passed through the dining hall to forage for food, but when they passed by a certain old student to the side, they clearly felt a dense, extremely dense, murderous aura.\u201cIs this the pharmaceutical branch\u2019s tradition?\u201d With one hand carrying a lunchbox and the other still holding the Chinese Herb Encyclopedia, unable to make heads or tails of it, Tang Nazhi looked a glance at the senior that he\u2019d brushed past, who had a fierce appearance.Shen Yanxiao shrugged her shoulders to loosen off some of the ache from her body. In the period of these two days, she\u2019d practically spent all of her time sitting before a desk, cramming. The result could still be regarded as not bad, but today, all of the new students had all already been filtered out, for they were on the eve of participating in the pharmaceutical branch\u2019s class placement test.During every student intake, the students of the pharmaceutical branch would also be divided into 7 classes according to the 7 grade partitions\u2014red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue, and purple. The red class was ranked at the bottom, while the people from the purple class were the group of top students!Liked it?

Compared to Tang Nazhi, who appeared to be domineering on the outside, Lin Xuan felt that this Shen Jue, who was the youngest among the three of them, was much easier to get closer to.\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Shen Yanxiao asked.Lin Xuan panted. Secretly shooting a glance at the expressionless Tang Nazhi, very carefully, he opened his mouth and said, \u201cJust now, the tutor sent people to pass on the news that the class placement test will be pushed back by a month. Moreover, I\u2019ve heard them say that our class placement test this time will be somewhat special, and that it\u2019s very possible that it will be conducted along with students from the other branches.Shen Yanxiao raised her eyebrows. To be able to have the test postponed, speaking simply, couldn\u2019t be any better news to her, and in this way, she too would have the confidence to be able to understand even more.In fact, the pharmaceutical branch\u2019s class placement test was equal to having students of different talents separated and taught. The more inferior the grade of the class was, the lower the level the students in that said class could attain, and the students who were all previously from the violet class at the very least were able to be promoted to junior pharmacists from apprentice pharmacists after only a year of time.The worth of apprentice pharmacists was very low, for they practically couldn\u2019t make any medicine. Only when an apprentice pharmacist had reached the level of a junior pharmacist could they be considered a genuine pharmacist.With regards to their class placement, if one were to be initially allocated to the two classes below the yellow class, even if it had reached the time of graduation, it was very likely that it\u2019d be very hard for them to become pharmacists.\u201cCollaborating with the students of the other branches? This is actually quite uncommon.\u201d Tang Nazhi appeared to be rather interested towards this news. He looked at Shen Yanxiao and asked, \u201cThere\u2019s another month to study. How much of a certainty do you have in entering the purple class? Is it ninety percent?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Shen Yanxiao broke into a cold sweat, for Tang Nazhi\u2019s confidence towards her was truly so big that it was exceptional. So how could she have the nerve to tell him that she didn\u2019t even have a tenth of certainty as of now?It truly wasn\u2019t proper of her to reply Tang Nazhi\u2019s question. Shen Yanxiao could only use the old method\u2014using her smile as a reply.This smile, which Tang Nazhi didn\u2019t want to see as often as he did during these two days, made him already subconsciously treat this smile as Shen Yan Xiao\u2019s symbol of absolute confidence!\u201cIt looks like you have a hundred percent certainty. In that case, I\u2019ll trouble you to help me have a sudden breakthrough in this period of time! Fellow brother, my hopes of entering the purple class will be counting on you!\u201d Tang Nazhi solemnly patted Shen Yanxiao\u2019s shoulder.\u201c\u2026\u201d In the end, just which eyes of his had seen that caused him to think that she had a hundred percent certainty!!!The corner of Shen Yanxiao\u2019s mouth slightly twitched.\u201cSince there\u2019s still quite an ample amount of time, we don\u2019t need to urgently study like this. Let\u2019s go! Brothers, I shall take you with me, and go enrich your experiences.\u201d Tang Nazhi gave a mischievous laughter. Swinging his arms, the lunchbox and book that were in his hands were tossed to Lin Xuan who was at the side. With one of them over Shen Yanxiao\u2019s frail shoulder, facing the opposite direction, he walked over to it with a soaring heroic spirit.\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d Before Tang Nazhi\u2019s tall and slim figure, Shen Yanxiao was exceedingly petite, and could only be dragged by Tang Nazhi\u2014moving towards somewhere unknown.\u201cYou\u2019ll know it right away after we get there.\u201d Tang Nazhi gave her a strange smile, and pretended that it was a mystery.\u2026Shen Yanxiao finally knew why Tang Nazhi would be mysterious like that.Seeing betting tables of all sizes, and the scene with a boiling cauldron of voices before her eyes, the corner of Shen Yanxiao\u2019s eyebrows slightly twitched.\u201cHow is it? You, lad, have never been to this kind of place before, right?\u201d With his arm on Shen Yanxiao\u2019s shoulder, and with the posture of a close friend, Tang Nazhi hadn\u2019t sensed the slightest bit of Shen Yanxiao\u2019s facial expression twitching.Liked it?
