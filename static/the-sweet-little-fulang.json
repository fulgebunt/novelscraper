    "Chapter 1": "Chapter 1Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayQingxi Village was very close to the mountain, and was named after the Qingxi River next to the village.The second room of the Shen family on the west side of the village was very lively today.Shen Shunfu had been gone two years earlier. Under the help of his wife, Wei Lanxiang, he found a marriage for his second son, Shen Xuanqing, and married Lu Wen from Anjia village, three villages apart.Lu Wen, the shuang'er child of the Lu family, was notoriously good-looking, and had attended school for a few days in the town. No matter how he spoke or dressed, it was different.He looked good and could read. In Wei Lanxiang's opinion, he was naturally compatible with her second child, and she asked Shen Xuanqing what he meant. Seeing that her son was willing, she was resolute and promised a dowry of 20 taels of silver. The marriage was given, and today was finally the time to get married.The gongs and drums were beaten, the suona was played, and the welcoming team came back. As soon as they stopped, they were surrounded by people for money, and the shouts and music was mixed together, making it extremely lively.The more people who came to the wedding, the happier the host would be. The Shen family was naturally not stingy with throwing money for the happy event. Someone took out a lot of copper coins from the red cloth and sprinkled it into the crowd. For a time it became more lively, everyone rushed to grab it .Amidst the sound of firecrackers and joyous music, the tall Shen Xuanqing, dressed in a red cloth, took out the bridegroom with a red veil from the sedan chair, walked all the way across the courtyard into the main room, crossed the brazier and worshipped, and led the people go to the new house.He was usually not too expressive. Today was the big day to marry a fulang. Amidst the booing of the young men, Shen Xuanqing's eyes were full of satisfied smiles.In the new room, Shen Xuanqing led Lu Wen to sit beside the bed, and then went over to close the door.According to their rules here, he couldn't take off his veil yet, and he couldn't come in until after toasting to the guests outside.The person beside the bed kept clutching the fabric on his lap after he sat down. Shen Xuanqing didn't think much about it, thinking that Lu Wen was too nervous. Looking at the thin hands, he thought that Lu Wen was really working at home, and there were old scars on his hands, which should have been scratched.After the marriage was made, someone told him how to marry a young master who couldn't even work. Wasn't this nonsense?When looking for a matchmaker to discuss a marriage, the other party said that Lu family's Lu Wen was indeed a little more delicate. Although he couldn't do heavy work, he was diligent and quick. He was good at cooking and laundry. The bags of medicine sachets he made was sold in the town, either to earn a little for himself, or to subsidize the family.Shen Xuanqing never thought of letting his fulang do heavy work to earn money to support the family. He even knew how to cook and do laundry. In order to hunt, he often lived alone in a wooden house in the mountains for ten days or half a month. If he couldn't cook, he could only eat dry food.After he came in, he stood beside the bed for a while and didn't know what to do, as if he was made nervous by his own fulang. He walked a few steps on the spot, and he didn't know where to put his hands and feet. If others saw this look, It was necessary to laugh at him a few times.\"I'll go out to toast first.\" At the end, Shen Xuanqing remembered that there was still this matter, so he raised his feet and went out.As soon as he opened the door, he stopped again, turned around and said to the person beside the bed, \"I'll ask Shen Yan to get you something to eat, so let's make it for cushion first.\"Shen Xuanqing saw that he heard it, maybe he was too shy to speak, so he didn't do what he thought, and closed the door smoothly.After he went out, the people in the room sat stiffly, and when he was the only one left, he seemed to take a breath and bent his back slightly. Not long after, the door was pushed open again, and a girl in a new cyan cloth walked in with the noodle soup. It was Shen Yan, the younger sister of Shen Xuanqing and Shen Yaoqing.She looked more than twelve years old, with a round face and almond eyes. She smiled when she saw the newlyweds sitting beside the bed. She was still a little curious about this fulang who she had only met two or three times. He was the best looking. Her brother Lu Wen was already good-looking, and she didn't know what it would be like today.\"Brother Wen, I brought you noodle soup, and my mother asked my aunt who helped the cook to add eggs in it. Eat it while it's hot.\"Shen Yan said, and put the bowl and chopsticks into Lu Wen's hands. No one moved, her hand holding the chopsticks tightened. She smiled and said, \"Brother Wen, I'll go out first. You can just put it on the table after you finish eating.\"It was not the time yet, and Lu Wen couldn't show his face in front of outsiders.Shen Yan was young, so she didn't think too much, so she also closed the door and went out.After there was no one else in the room, the person beside the bed carefully placed the bowl and chopsticks on the edge of the bed, then lifted the corner of the veil and quietly looked around the room.If Shen Yan was present, she would definitely recognize that the person in the room was not the Lu Wen she had seen before.Compared to Lu Wen's literacy aura, Lu Gu looked very thin and frail because he couldn't eat enough to work all day.The window of this room was opened to the front yard. Fortunately, in order to prevent the bride and groom from being seen by others, the window was closed, and the window bolt was bolted from the inside.It was very lively outside. Someone was comparing wine with Shen Xuanqing. It should be Shen Xuanqing who finished drinking first, and the crowd burst into cheers.The liveliness of others was terrifying to Lu Gu. He felt uneasy, and when he thought that he was really put into the sedan chair and brought to Shen's house, his face became even paler.He didn't know how the Shen family was, but he knew about Shen Xuanqing. Last year, he and several other went to the tofu shop to buy tofu. On the way, there was a fight. Among them was Shen Xuanqing, tall and strong, with a fist in the face, the other person fell down.Lu Gu, who was beaten every three or five minutes, took a step back at that time. If it hit him, it would be much more powerful than his stepmother's stick and rattan. Maybe he could go to see his mother directly.Someone told him that the man was the hunter of Qingxi Village, and Lu Gu remembered it from then on. Anjia Village and Qingxi Village were not close, but they were not too far. Fortunately, he didn't encounter them again after two or three quarters of an hour.For Shen Xuanqing, he had few contacts, and he didn't dare to take a second glance at such a vicious man, but three months ago, the matchmaker told his elder brother Lu Wen about the marriage, and it was Shen Xuanqing.Lu Wen was born to his stepmother Du Hehua and the first man. After the man died, he brought Lu Wen to the Lu family.Lu Gu felt a little startled when he thought of Shen Xuanqing, but when he thought about it, it had nothing to do with him. It was for Lu Wen. What's more, at home, the stepmother would call him when she instructed him to work, and even his own father didn't pay much attention to him. He was looking for something, and the work was still good. He was most afraid of starvation and beatings.Lu Wen's marriage was only known from others. But even if he knew about it, he didn't even ask a single word when he got home, lowered his head to work and didn't speak, and tried to keep his movements light as much as possible, otherwise if he was noticed by his stepmother, he would be able to give himself more nitpicking.In the area of \u200b\u200bFenggu Town, after the matchmaker and the parents of both parties agreed on something, they would also let the two young people meet.There were also rules for seeing each other. You had to meet in another family with a daughter or a Shuang'er. Most of the daughter or Shuang'er was sitting by the window and the other was working. Stayed for a while, so that you could see each other without causing gossip.Logically speaking, how could Shuang'er go to the Hanzi's village, so when the two saw each other, it was Shen Xuanqing who came to Anjia Village.[Hanzi: the man, husband]That day, Lu Gu was stuffed with dirty clothes by his stepmother. On the way to the river, he saw the tall figure in the distance, so he went around from the other side.The stepmother often scolded him that he was an unlucky ghost. Lu Gu sometimes thought to himself, as if he really had no luck. He was afraid that bad luck would happen to him. If he accidentally angered Shen Xuanqing, he would be beaten. It was miserable, so avoid it if you could.Now, he really was an unlucky person, even the absurd thing of marrying for his brother fell on him, and the stepmother even coaxed him to say that she was kind enough to find a good marriage for him.If it was a good thing, how could it be his turn.He didn't know what his stepmother was thinking. Although he didn't know how to read, he also knew that Lu Wen and Shen Xuanqing had asked someone to write a marriage contract. It was Lu Wen's name, not his, so how dare you made such a mess.It was not that he didn't understand that the stepmother was just coveting the 20 tasks dowry and didn't want to return it to the Shen family.It was said that the Shen family gave so much dowry money, and it was a heavy gift in any village, which showed that the family was not thin, and everyone thought that it was a good marriage, but Lu Wen wanted to regret the marriage.Others didn't know, but Lu Gu knew a little. He overheard the conversation between Lu Wen and his stepmother six or seven days ago.Lu Wen seemed to be in close contact with people in the town. Lu Wen was already engaged. He was really unlucky, and the stepmother discovered this by accident.He thought he was going to be beaten, but when he squinted at his stepmother, she smiled at him and grabbed his hand gently. With a motherly appearance, made Lu Gu terrified.When he heard that he was going to give him Lu Wen's marriage to the hunter in Qingxi Village, Lu Gu shook his head at that time. The stepmother looked at him, gnashing her teeth and scolding him for not knowing what to do, and she squeezed the flesh on his arm hard, it hurt and made him wanted to pull back, and he didn't dare to say that he didn't want to.Since that day, the stepmother stopped letting him go out to wash the clothes and changed things, and he could only stay in the yard to do needlework. The stepmother was still watching him all the time, obviously afraid that he would run away or to tell other people.It was still lively outside.Lu Gu sat on the edge of the bed and didn't dare to move, but his stomach didn't live up to his expectations, and was seduced by the smell of meat outside.Early in the morning, he was dragged by his stepmother to wash and put on makeup. He just put on his wedding dress and put him on the sedan chair, without even giving him a stutter.It was not that he didn't resist, he even jumped over the wall at night the day before yesterday, so as not to be found and beaten to death by Shen Xuanqing after the incident was revealed, but he couldn't run away. As soon as he ran out of the village in the dark, he was caught by his stepmother and father.In the woodshed, he was gagged with rags, and his cries were gagged in his throat. Fear and despair made him tremble all over, but he was beaten badly. For two days after that, he could only eat rough food every day. He didn't even have the strength to run far.The noodle soup was hot, with oil and chopped green onions floating in the air. The less onion was just to give a taste, but there was a lot of oil. Shen Yan also said that there was a poached egg lying underneath.Lu Gu looked at the bowl of noodles. He hadn't eaten such hot noodles for a long time. It was made of fine white flour and even had eggs.He picked up the bowl and took a sip of the hot soup first. The oil, chives and shallots fragrantly entered his mouth. He had only tasted such a good taste when he was a child.There weren't many noodles, but it was just a pad for his stomach. After the noodles and eggs were in his stomach, Lu Gu held the bowl and was reluctant to put it down so he drank the soup.He was the only one in the room now, no one would take the bowl from him, and no stick would fall, so he sipped such a fragrant green onion soup, trying to remember the taste.With a drip, water fell into the soup, he wiped his tears, thinking that it would be good to eat a bowl of hot noodle soup before he died, at least he wouldn't be a starving ghost.The one who should in the Shen family was Lu Wen. Once it found out that he was not Lu Wen, they would definitely not give up.Lu Gu had heard more than once that someone beat his wife or fulang to death. In his opinion, Shen Xuanqing was fierce and vicious, and today may really be his death.No matter how much noodle soup was over, Lu Gu felt a little reluctant when he put down the bowl. Hearing that someone outside was making a noise about the bridal chamber, his face turned pale, and he quickly sat back on the bed and covered his head.He clenched the fabric on his leg tightly, panicked and lost, so scared that his body was shaking slightly, but fortunately, the noise outside was suppressed by Shen Xuanqing and a few others laughing and persuading him, saying that the groom was timid and shameless. Boo, his body was not good, he still ate and drank good food and wine outside, everyone fought and drank together, it was lively, and the bridal room gradually subsided, and Lu Gu had a kind of escape from death feeling.But as the guests dispersed after the banquet, the shadow of death enveloped him again.The door was opened and closed, and someone walked towards the bed. Soon, in Lu Gu's low vision, a pair of boots that were not often worn by farmers appeared. The new boots were large and obviously men's, enough to see opponent's physique.Lu Gu was trembling, the knuckles of his fingers clutching the clothes turned white, and the moment the red veil was lifted, his blood seemed to be frozen, and his mind went blank.And Shen Xuanqing, who took off the veil, saw the appearance of the fresh fulang, the smile on his face disappeared, and he suddenly became stiff.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2 Part 1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayFor a moment, Lu Gu forgot to breathe.When he saw Shen Xuanqing's cold and angry expression, his brain buzzed, and he seemed to have hallucinations in front of him. He had already imagined that he would die under the stick and fist.In a trance, he didn't know where he was, nor did he know Shen Xuanqing angrily slammed out the door, until an anxious cry rang from the door, which brought him back to his senses.There were several people around the door. After seeing that he was not Lu Wen, Wei Lanxiang fainted.\"Mother! Mother, don't worry, don't worry.\"Shen Yan and sister-in-law Ji Qiuyue hurriedly supported Wei Lanxiang who had fallen down. The aunt who helped in the village immediately came over to help, and the Shen family, who was originally happy, suddenly became chaotic.Wei Lanxiang woke up quickly, she took a breath, looked at Lu Gu in the room, and said angrily, \"Who are you?\"Tears flowed down without knowing it , her eyes widened and it was difficult to breathe.\"This seems to be Lu Gu from their family. It was born to Lu Daxiang's first wife.\"Lu Gu stammered and couldn't speak, but fortunately someone helped to recognize him. She was from the village next to Anjia Village and was not married. People used to walk around with the girls from Anjia Village, but after five or six years, she only had a vague impression of Lu Gu, and it took a while to recognize him.Hearing this, Wei Lanxiang became even more angry. For the sake of this marriage, the family had been busy for a long time and didn't 't talk about it. She took out 20 taels of honorable gifts, not to mention the things she hired at the beginning. Which one was not money?Beside, since her man died, their family had only been getting better recently.Shen Shunfu accidentally slipped and fell when he entered the mountain in winter three years ago, broke his leg, and fell into the pool of water.Although he fell on the edge of the shallow water, he struggled to climb up, but falling into the biting ice water in the winter was enough for anyone to get fever.His clothes were soaking wet, and he was so cold that he couldn't crawl out very far with a broken leg.Later, some people in the village who went up the mountain to chop firewood heard a slight movement and rescued Shen Shunfu, who was frozen blue and purple.For this injury, it cost a lot of money just to see a doctor and get medicine, and sold a lot of things. Unfortunately, no one was rescued. All kinds of good medicinal materials were hanged, and it lasted for a month and a half.At the age of ten, Shen Xuanqing worshipped an old hunter in the mountains as a teacher. Fortunately, he had already learned the skill. After his father died, he left the teacher. He went hunting in the mountains by himself. He would go to a nearby town or county as a day laborer to carry a large bag. After two or three years, their hand were not so tight anymore.Life at home was difficult for a while because of lack of money. Fortunately, Shen Xuanqing and his elder brother Shen Yaoqing were both able to live up to their expectations. At that time, they were fifteen and twenty, and they were both young men who had the strength to endure hardships.Seeing that the days were getting better and better, Wei Lanxiang saw that her second son was eighteen, and the marriage should have been settled long ago, but it was only because of the delays in the past few years, how could a good family's shuang'er or daughters be willing to suffer for someone who had no money. Besides, Shen Xuanqing was only fifteen when he tightened his trousers and worked hard with his brother, and he was only a half-year-old boy.When Shen Shunfu was there, their family life was pretty good, so even Shen Yaoqing had never suffered this kind of hardship when he was fifteen years old. She felt bad for her second son and didn't want to perfunctory about his son's marriage, until this year she fell in love with Lu Wen, betrothed him to Shen Xuanqing.The 20 taels of dowry was for Lu Wen who was good-looking and knowledgeable. She spent 20 taels, and the Lu family actually married someone else. How could she swallow this breath?\"Let's go! Go to your Lu family and reason with me. I see what Lu Daxiang and Du Hehua have to say!\"Wei Lanxiang pushed away the person who was supporting her, pulled Lu Gu and walked out, very angry, where would she care that Lu Gu was dragged by her and staggered.She walked halfway and said to Shen Xuanqing, \"Go, bring me the marriage certificate!\"The good marriage had become like this, and the rest of the Shen family couldn't bear it. After Shen Xuanqing took the marriage certificate, they all went to find Lu's house.The leftovers in the yard hadn't been cleaned up yet, and Wei Lanxiang was even more angry when she saw it, knowing that the dishes on the feast today were brought by her son who had been busy for more than a month.Shen Xuanqing had hunting skills, and he spent a lot of money on betrothal gifts. He couldn't help but be a little tight. In order to save a little on the wedding banquet, he started preparing early.All tables were served with ten dishes and one soup, including stewed chicken nuggets and wild boar, a bowl of sliced \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bpig heart and lungs, a bowl of liver miscellaneous, as well as spicy fried rabbit meat and a plate of steamed fish. There were six meat dishes alone. In this way, plus four kinds of vegetarian dishes and an old bowl of meatball soup, it could be said that it was rare and rich.Even in those wealthy villages, wedding events were not necessarily as generous as the second room of the Shen family, and the meat and vegetables were so rich.The banquet hall of their house made many people in the village unable to put down their chopsticks, and their mouths were full of oil. Not only childrens were disregarding their decency, but even some adults were like this, for fear that they would be less than others.And most of the meat dishes were attributed by Shen Xuanqing. In addition to the chickens raised by their family, he beat five or six pheasants on the mountain, chopped them into pieces and mixed them with the chickens, so there was no need to kill the laying hens at home. The rabbit was caught by him in the mountains with two hounds.It was hot in the summer. In order not to let the rabbits and pheasants go bad, Shen Xuanqing put a lot of effort into catching them alive and raising them at home for a while.He also beat the wild boars. The wild boars in the mountains were not easy to mess with, especially the male wild boars with tusks. Fortunately, he was lucky. After seven or eight days in the deep mountains, he used the traps he dug to hack and killed a big one.There were not enough pig hearts, lungs and livers for more than twenty tables, so Shen Xuanqing went to the town to buy some more. As for more than thirty fishes, he caught them in the Qingxi River.It was true that there was no money in the things from the mountains and rivers, but everything was not easy to come by.In order to prepare for these, he didn't stop for more than a month. He became dark and thin, and he almost fell asleep late at night. However, when he thought of marrying a fulang, he had a face that was not very expressive, but he felt hot, and there was a rush in his heart.Ever since the family had gotten better, Shen Xuanqing still lived in the mountains to hunt. Every time his mother gave him dry food, he would always say nothing. But if he married a wife or fulang, he would be able to eat a mouthful of hot meal.Like other men, he had no other ideas in the past, he only needed to work hard to make the family live a good life. When he got older, he saw people of the same age marrying wife and having children one after another, and his mother kept talking about it from time to time. Shen Xuanqing gradually became interested in marrying a fulang.It seemed to be more lively when two people lived together in the mountains, at least he could talk to someone.So after the marriage with Lu Wen was settled, he didn't say anything, but he was happy in his heart, and it was worth it no matter how tired he was.Unexpectedly, when the red veil was lifted and saw another shuang'er, all his joy seemed to be drowned out by a basin of cold water , and he didn't even understand why it happened.Lu Gu was dressed in red, and Shen Xuanqing, who frowned tightly, did not change his clothes, and he attracted attention as soon as he went out.Seeing Wei Lanxiang pulling the bridegroom's face full of anger, the villagers were puzzled, how could the Shen family be like this on a happy day.At the entrance of the village, they met a few young men chatting, and Shen Yaoqing, who was left behind, said a few words to them briefly, and those people went with them.If you went to other villages to find trouble, you may suffer a loss if you were weak. In addition, it was heard that the people from Qingxi Village had been fooled. These people had a good relationship with the Shen brothers, and naturally shared the same enemy.His eyes were red and full of fear, he didn't know what to do, and his thin body looked very thin against the loose clothes. This dress was made for Lu Wen. He was thinner than Lu Wen and didn't fit at all. He poked his head out, and quickly shrank back because of the angry rebuke.A group of people rushed towards Anjia Village.When they arrived at Anjia Village, they saw the bridegroom and the groom in red. Some people were still muttering that it was not the time to return to the door. It was only when they saw Lu Gu's face that they suddenly realized.He was dragged away almost all the way, and Lu Gu stumbled and stumbled under his feet, but luckily he didn't fall.The Lu family was not far from entrance of the village, and even if someone wanted to tip them off, it was too late. In addition, the group of young men stared, almost no one wanted to meddle in their business and caused trouble where they could see.The courtyard door was kicked open with a kick, and Lu Gu's heart trembled. Wei Lanxiang pulled his arm and entered the Lu's house with an angry face, \"From the Lu family, come out for me! \"Du Hehua came out of from the window .\"Du Hehua! You made it clear to me today that my son married Lu Wen from your family, so how could he become Lu Gu?\"Out of anger, Wei Lanxiang, who usually spoke softly, was forced to raise her voice. Let the surrounding Anjia Village people heard it clearly.She took out the red paper on which the marriage certificate was written, unfolded it and said, \"It's clearly written on it, it's your Lu Wen, not Lu Gu!\"\"I want to ask you Lu family? What's your heart?\"\"Look at our orphans and widowed mothers being bullied? I tell you Du Hehua, you can't think about it! \"Looking at this group of people, she couldn't help but be afraid, but she didn't want to be scolded like this. There were so many people watching the fun outside, where should she put her face?She was anxious and embarrassed , and when she saw Lu Gu, she immediately pointed at Lu Gu and scolded: \"Well, you shameless, I said that I couldn't find anyone early in the morning, so it turned out that he carried himself on the sedan chair , you shameless and skinless thing, I will beat you to death today!\"Du Hehua was used to taking Lu Gu with anger, and she didn't hesitate to beat and scold, she picked up a wooden stick in the corner and rushed over to beat someone.As soon as Lu Gu saw the stick, he wanted to hide back subconsciously, and his face was even whiter than before.But when she got to the front, Du Hehua was frightened back by a few young men staring at her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His face was made up by the old woman, so is it possible that aunt doesn't know?\"Wei Lanxiang continued to scold: \"Are you dead? Let him wear Lu. Wen's clothes?\"Then she asked, \"Where is Lu Wen? Let him come out for me, I want to see how talented Lu Gu is, and if he is promoted to become the new fulang, Lu Wen still don't know?.\"Ji Qiuyue echoed loudly: \"Yes, let Lu Wen come out. Our family married Lu Wen, and Lu Gu will send back to you. Lu Wen has to follow us back.\"\"Let Lu Wen come out.\" Two aunts who was friends with Wei Lanxiang also pointed to the other side and shouted, \"I have never seen Shuang'er married and hiding at home, and replaced by someone else. Your Lu family's work is really new.\"Du Hehua couldn't beat them, and several people have more mouths. Seeing that the situation was wrong, she immediately changed her face, and started crying while sitting on the ground.\"You're a jerk, what kind of sin have I done for you to spread such an unconscionable thing...\"She was crying and scrambling, and she didn't know who she was scolding. She refused to say where Lu Wen was.Most of the unreasonable village women were like this. Ji Qiuyue took it for granted and said, \"Auntie, you won't let Lu Wen come out, but I can go in and find him myself. It's only right and proper for our new fulang to go back with us.\"Du Hehua turned a deaf ear, screaming, ooh, ooh, and she didn't care that she was covered in dust, and she cried more and more terribly.When Ji Qiuyue saw her like this, she knew that Lu Wen was probably not at Lu's house, but she still didn't give up. She went in and searched for a circle and came out quickly, not to mention Lu Wen, not even Lu Daxiang's shadow.\"What happened?\"Bao Zhiru, the head of Anjia Village, came over after hearing the news, and behind him were some young and strong men in the village.The people of Qingxi Village were blocking the yard. When Du Hehua saw the village chief coming, she immediately cried across the crowd: \"They beat people, They beat me. If you don't come, Third Uncle, I will be beaten to death by them.\"Bao Zhiru was already sixty-two years old, and was considered to be highly respected in his old age. Because he was the third oldest, the villagers often called him the third uncle, and even the people in the nearby villages called him the same.Wei Lanxiang glared at Du Hehua, took the marriage certificate after Bao Zhiru came, and wiped her tears and cried, \"Third uncle, our family married Lu Wen, it's all written on it, but they married Lu Gu over here , isn't this bullying?, I can't take this breath.\"Bao Zhiru recognized the words, held up the red paper to identify it under the sun, and then looked at Lu Gu who was wearing a wedding dress, his brows wrinkled.It was not easy to handle this, even people in Anjia Village knew that the Lu family was at fault.Bao Zhiru thought about it, it was the Shen family who was justified, and if it really went to the county government office, the master of the government would naturally want Lu Wen to go to the Shen family when he saw the marriage certificate, so he said, \"I said Hehua, since they have the marriage certificate to prove it, you can't be confused.\"Hearing this, Du Hehua got up from the ground, crying and wiping her tears, \"Third uncle, you don't know, our family Lu Gu is so big, but he has no idea. He doesn't even have a marriage proposal, and if he drag it on like this, how can I see his mother in the future, if it wasn't for him, would I be able to give him such a good marriage?\"\"I was confused for a while, seeing him crying pitifully and softening my heart. I just nodded.\"\"I thought, whoever marry will live behind closed doors. Besides, it's the same when the lights are blown at night.\"Suddenly it was brought to him, and Lu Gu was at a loss words, he subconsciously shook his head, that's not the case, he didn't ask his stepmother for this marriage.Being so angry because Du Hehua was talking nonsense, Wei Lanxiang scolded directly: \"Fuck you motherfucker! Your Lu family fools people and treats others as fools, what's the same? I'm going to marry Lu Wen so I gave a heavy gift of 20 taels, otherwise who will be taken advantage of!\"During the quarrel, Lu Gu didn't dare to speak, but Shen Xuanqing, who was a few steps away from him, gave him a look, and the tall man's frowning and cold face made him terrified.He knew at once that Shen Xuanqing was wondering if it was the marriage he asked from his stepmother.Not only Shen Xuanqing, but other people would look at him like this. When he was discovered by the Shen family, Lu Gu was already embarrassed enough. After coming, now the stepmother turned black and white, so that his already crumbling face and dignity had been completely torn apart in front of so many people, and there was no more.\"Mother, it's obviously Brother Wen and the people from the town...\"It was summer, but Lu Gu seemed to be shivering from the cold. He didn't speak loudly, but Du Hehua, who had been paying attention to whether he could talk nonsense, immediately responded. She was furious and scolded: \"Oh, you shameless little prostitute! Your short-lived mother is so good, you didn't learn any good thing, but you learned it thoroughly! I don't know whose wild seed he is, I kindly raised you, you're not short food and clothing, but now you're here to harm our brother Wen.\"The words \"wild seed\" completely made Lu Gu's face lost the blood.Du Hehua scolded him more and more harshly, and even Wei Lanxiang couldn't stand it anymore. Just when she was about to scold her, she heard Shen Xuanqing speak.\"Enough!\" He took a step forward, his brows still furrowed, and he said solemnly, \"It was your Lu family who regretted their marriage first. Since Lu Wen doesn't want to marry, I won't force it. It's just that the 20 taels of betrothal money can't be free for you.\"Wei Lanxiang pointed at Du Hehua and said angrily: \"Yes, and the betrothal gift in front of you, which one wasn't bought with money? Your family Lu Wen received our money and clothes, but the wedding day ran away. If you don\u2019t get married but you take the money, you Lu family will take up all the good things. How can there be such a thing in the world without the king\u2019s law?\u201d\"We can't give money to your family, and we can't even see a person's shadow so pay back the money!\" Ji Qiuyue was also very angry, the more she talked, the more excited she became.Du Hehua blushed when she heard the word repayment, not ashamed, but anxious, that was a full 20 taels of silver, and it was already in her hands, to ask her to return it, it would kill her!\"You are small prostitute, I'm talking to your mother, it's your turn to yell here?\" She pointed at Ji Qiuyue's nose and cursed.Ji Qiuyue didn't faint from anger, but she was so angry that her face flushed red and she gasped for breath, but Shen Yaoqing hurried over to help her and let her calm down.\"Du Hehua, you!\" Wei Lanxiang's hands were shaking as she pointed at Du Hehua and scolded angrily.\"Auntie, you can eat indiscriminately, but you can't talk nonsense.\"Shen Yaoqing supported his daughter-in-law and looked at Du Hehua, his face was ashen, told her to shut up.Ji Qiuyue was not submissive either, where she ever suffered from this kind of anger, she was originally a lively temperament, she usually spoke lightly and slowly, but now she was getting annoyed and her mouth became even quicker, and she repeatedly scolded: \"This one is not a prostitute. Aunt's Shuang'er are prostitutes, and they are all mixed up with the people in the town, if my aunt is really ashamed, she should hang herself now, otherwise I will be sorry for your Lu family ancestors!\"Shuang'er and the girl's reputations were undoubtedly important. Ji Qiuyue knew this, she just couldn't bear it. She clearly agreed to marry, but she regretted it, co-authored and played their family like a monkey, and Du Hehua insulted her innocence first.Hearing this, Du Hehua was like a lit cannonball, blushed, scolding and jumping feet: \"You bastard, falsely accusing my brother Wen in empty words, see if I don't tear your mouth apart!\"She rushed over and raised her hand to hit Ji Qiuyue, but Shen Yaoqing grabbed her arm and shoved her to the side, she fell to the ground, and immediately burst into tears, shouting that she was going to die, she was going to die.When a group of young men from Anjia Village saw people from other villages moved their hands, they stared at them and were about to fight.Ji Qiuyue saw that they were glaring at Shen Yaoqing, on the other side's territory, if there was a real fight, only the people from the Shen family would suffer, so she sneered and said quickly: \"Sure enough, you are overbearing in Anjia Village.asking for a reason will also be beaten, I see the reputation of your Anjia Village spread out, how many people you want to stab the spine, I don't believe it, there is no justice in this world!\"After all, Bao Zhiru was the chief, he was at a loss with this Lu family, and if they did such absurd things, it would really damage the reputation of their Anjia Village. Besides, if the people of Qingxi Village were beaten today. If they went back and gathered a group of people, things would get bigger. Knowing by the county government, although he was a bit thin, he couldn't avoid being ridiculed by some people behind his back.He pressed his hand, motioned the people of Anjia Village to calm down, and said, \"Okay, alright, this matter already happened. It's like calling back and forth. If you have something to say, you don't have to be so angry. \"\" No, but the money can't be given to them in vain.\" Wei Lanxiang wiped her tears and said with hatred.Since it was the Lu family who regretted their marriage first, it was only natural for the Shen family to propose to return the betrothal money. In this way, the matter was over. Bao Zhiru looked at Du Hehua.Before he could say anything, he saw Du Hehua howling, sitting on the ground clapping his thighs and crying: \"God damn it, I've been in bad luck for eight lifetimes, and this kind of thing happened to me in the morning. You didn't send it back until now. Your Shen family said that you are a good person, but behind the scenes, I'm afraid that someone has been occupied a long time ago. Ask me for money, how can I live?\"Du Hehua cried and cried, not even having a door on his mouth, so she shouted indiscriminately.\"Du Hehua! You fart!\" When Wei Lanxiang heard that she would frame her son regardless of Lu Gu's innocence, how could she bear it, she picked up the stick that Du Hehua had just thrown on the ground. Having never suffered from this kind of cowardice, she picked up a stick and hit her.\"It's not good to beat people!\"Lu Daxiang's younger brother Lu Dahe and his two sons were originally watching from the outside. After all, their Lu family didn't take care of them, but when they saw the fight, everyone in the village watched. Unable to shrink his head, he shoved a few middle-aged men with good relationships and beat them together.Du Hehua usually had a loud voice, but now she was beaten and howled like a pig, causing Lu Daxiang, who was hiding nearby, jumped out, pretending to just come back from work in the field, holding a hoe angrily, he ran into the courtyard gate and scuffled with the people of Qingxi Village.In the blink of an eye, the situation changed. Bao Zhiru was so angry that his beard could lift up. The few young men he brought with him listened to his words and started fighting.There was a mess in the yard, the men scuffled together, and Lu Dahe's wife and daughter-in-law also came in a hurry, otherwise, they couldn't watch Du Hehua being beaten and scolded by Wei Lanxiang, Ji Qiuyue and two village women.Before everyone noticed, Lu Gu lowered his head and avoided the crowd.Even if someone knew that Du Hehua was talking nonsense just now, but even his own stepmother said that. What about his stepmother? Du Hehua had raised him for all these years. Okay, acted like a good stepmother.A shuang'er was returned the same day after they got married, and he had no face at all, and now she said in front of so many people that he had lost his innocence.Not long after, someone ran in to the head of the village, shouting, \"No, no, Lu Gu jumped into the river!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He was torn by the swirling river water filling his head.His eyes were blurred, and the wedding dress was a bit more cumbersome and heavier than the summer clothes he often wore. After sinking into the water, the fabric became heavy when it absorbed the water, making his light and helpless soul return to its place, hanging in the air, not knowing where to go. His heart gradually sank.If you died, you didn't need to be beaten anymore.He thought calmly, his body floated down the river, he gradually stopped thinking about things, but in the end, he had a pity idea, unfortunately he died without even a thin coffin, his stepmother wouldn't pay to give him a coffin.\u2014\u2014The people in the yard were still fighting, and Bao Zhiru was so angry that he yelled at them: \"Stop, stop me!\"As soon as he finished speaking, he heard someone shouted that Lu Gu jumped into the river, and Bao Zhiru quickly said: \"Don't hurry to save people.\"Life was at stake, and the fighters stopped. Du Hehua got up from the ground and spat blood at Wei Lanxiang's feet. Half of her cheeks were swollen, and her mouth was still full of blood. Cursing vaguely, she was covered in dirt, but no one else was much better in the chaos.Before Wei Lanxiang could let out her anger, she was slapped again, and she kicked her with her foot. Unfortunately, Du Hehua avoided it.Bao Zhiru was about to go out with the people when he looked back and shouted, \"you will get beaten and scolded!\"Du Hehua originally wanted to spit again, but she had to swallow it when she heard the words.Listening to a group of people outside running towards the river, because it was Shuang'er who fell into the water, the men from Qingxi Village didn't go over to join in the fun.It stand to reason that Du Hehua would have to go to see if others didn't go, but she didn't, instead she sat aside with her messy hair tucked up.Lu Daxiang didn't even go, he covered his waist and rib , hissed and inhaled, feeling that the pain was unbearable everywhere. He grinned and glanced at Shen Xuanqing, it was not that he didn't know, that this son of a bitch had the most black hand, and even picked him up to beat him. He was swearing in his heart, but he didn't dare to swear out loud.There was always some firewood piled up in the yard of the farmer's house. Ji Qiuyue helped Wei Lanxiang and two other aunts to sit on the pile of firewood to rest and tidy up.Shen Yan, who was guarded by them after the fight, was obviously frightened. The wooden stick in her hand fell to the ground with a bang. During the melee, she kept crying and calling her mother, and she even took the opportunity to beat Du Hehua a few times.But now, Shen Yan's wide-open apricot eyes were obviously a bit fearful. She was the youngest in the family, and she was usually well-behaved. Even Ji Qiuyue pinched her round face to tease her when she had nothing to do. It could be said that she was favored. Never seen such a battle at all.Ji Qiuyue was a little frightened when she saw that her sister-in-law had regained her senses, so she patted Shen Yan's arm to comfort her, her mouth kept going, she looked at Du Hehua and said sarcastically, \"People say that Lu Wen is well-bred, but Lu Gu is not. The strange way is, it's not a mother, and the stepmother didn't anxious after he jumped into the river. It turned out that the good things in the weekdays were all pretending, but behind the scenes was a black heart.\"Before marrying the Lu family, they didn't inquire about it. They also knew about Lu Gu when they had been to the Lu family, but they had only seen Lu Gu in the Lu family several times. they occasionally asked, Du Hehua said that he went to his uncle's house to play, and they didn't take it to heart because they were in Anjia Village not for him. When others mentioned Du Hehua, they said that she was good to Lu Gu. As for the occasional beatings and scoldings, who in the village didn't beat their childrens?Besides, every time Du Hehua hit Lu Gu, if someone saw and heard her, they would say that Lu Gu broke the bowl or made other mistakes. She was in a hurry to move her hand.A farmer was no better than a family in a town or county. No matter dishes or other things, they were few things that couldn't be ruined.Before today, the Shen family thought that the Lu family was good, but they never thought it would be like this.Let alone at the river.There was no one in the turbulent section, but going downstream, there were people washing clothes in several places, and the red color in the water couldn't be more conspicuous.In addition, there were shouts from Anjia Village, saying that someone had jumped into the river. Soon, Lu Gu was rescued from the river by two Shuang'er who knew how to swim. He choked on the water. Fortunately, he was rescued in time. No worries about life.A girl picked up the red embroidered shoes from downstream and brought them over.There were a lot of people surrounded by the shore. Lu Gu was wearing a red dress that was wet and dripping with water. Fortunately, the clothes were in good condition, and he wasn't looked at by the few people who were looking straight at him.\"Why are you shaking like this?\" Lu Gu's body was cold, and even Shuang'er who rescued him was puzzled. It was obviously summer, and the sun hadn't yet set, so even if he fell into the water, it wouldn't freeze.As soon as he touched his forehead and hands, it was really cold, so a few people hurriedly shouted, \"Come back and make a fire and change the clothes.\"The gate of Lu's yard was open, and the people from Qingxi Village were still inside. Du Hehua and Lu Daxiang wanted to catch up. People couldn't beat them for a while, so they had to endure it.And when the eight Shuang'er and girls brought Lu Gu back and put down the people in the courtyard, they kept talking about changing Lu Gu's clothes quickly. Du Hehua rolled her eyes and cried with half of her face swollen, \"There is nothing left at home. All of his clothes were given to him as a dowry, where can I find it now.\"\"Either they said they were bullying people, or if they didn't take advantage of our Lu Gu and didn't admit it, how could he jump into the river?.\"\"You fart, obviously you don\u2019t accumulate virtue, and even your own family is framed, and you say that he has no innocence for no reason, it\u2019s clear that you want to kill him.\u201d Wei Lanxiang sat down without getting up, but picked up a piece of wood from the ground and smashed it to Du Hehua.Ji Qiuyue also said: \"Yes, outsiders dare not say such things. Your family is different from others. You can slander other's innocence with empty words, and just force the good Shuang'er to this point.\"Lu Gu's face turned pale . He opened his mouth, as if he wanted to explain something, his white lips moved, but in the end he didn't even make a slight sound.Du Hehua's words made a girl unable to listen, and said, \"Auntie, we don't understand and ignore what you say. You see that Lu Gu's face is so pale, if he doesn't change into clean clothes, I'm afraid he will get sick.\"\"Yes, auntie, no matter whose clothes are in the family, you can just find him and put them on.\" The others also agreed.This group of Shuang'er and girls were all young, their speech was clear and fast, and they were surrounded by their family members. Du Hehua was not easy to have a seizure, so she could only pinch her nose and say, \"The door of the firewood house is open.\"\"How can someone lie in the firewood room?\" someone said casually.Du Hehua was dissatisfied and said, \"Why can't he lie down?, he is so wet, who will wash the dirty bedding when he is carried into the room?\"he might wore a dress in normal times, after all, she could get a good reputation, but today the Shen family made such a fuss, making her lose face and reputation long ago, and when she was beaten, she was full of anger.So except for Lu Gu, everyone looked at Lu Daxiang, and when he was stared at, Lu Daxiang said impatiently, \"It's alright, let's help him in first.\"This was the case with fathers. Lu Gu, who was trembling all over, entered the woodshed.Seeing this, Bao Zhiru waved to the men in the courtyard who came back, and motioned for them to come out. The men from Anjia Village and Qingxi Village followed, even Lu Daxiang, and no one had any objection.Shen Xuanqing fell behind, after all the men came out, he kept silent and closed the courtyard door from the outside.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A shuang'er in the firewood room looked out of the hole in the door and found that there were no men in the courtyard, so they carefully opened the door and asked.\"What's the hurry, he can't die.\" Du Hehua said impatiently, and then walked into the house.\"This aunt.\" Shuang'er who asked the question was also not happy, and muttered.Seeing that there was a gap in the door of the firewood house, there was nothing taboo between Shuang'er and the girl, so Ji Qiuyue went in together.The wet clothes that they took off were placed next to him, and Lu Gu was barely wrapped in the other Shuang'er's jacket. Because it was summer, no one would wear more clothes, so even if the person in the woodshed wanted to take off his clothes to cover him they can't.The exposed arms and legs were covered with large bruises, and the severe areas turned purple-black. Lu Gu was curled up, and with a slight movement, his waist and back were exposed. The bruise marks on his waist clearly told everyone that his back was also covered in bruises. It was full of wounds.He was already thin, but he was beaten like this. When he was beaten, he didn't have much flesh on his body to block his bones. Whoever saw it would feel pity.Ji Qiuyue didn't have much affection for Lu Gu at first, and felt that the Lu family members were not good things, so they teamed up to deceive them. Now, it seemed that Lu Gu was not that bad. It seemed that the injury of this body was only suffered not long ago. Maybe it was because he was afraid of being beaten by the Lu family that he agreed to marry instead.Even though he knew that the people in the firewood house were kind, Lu Gu felt embarrassed to be watched, and he curled up as much as he could while hugging his legs.Du Hehua threw in a tattered dress, and after resting for a while, Lu Gu recovered and felt a little warmer, no longer so cold, and his strength returned. He could dress himself, and the others went out from the firewood door.Ji Qiuyue whispered what she saw to Wei Lanxiang. Wei Lanxiang just nodded and said nothing. The Lu family and the others couldn't afford it.Outside the yard, a young man from Anjia Village said a few words to Shen Xuanqing. He nodded, saying that he understood, and then thanked him. Anjia Village and Qingxi Village were not too close, but it didn't prevent him from getting to know a few people here. Although the relationship was normal, they could exchange news.It turned out that Lu Wen had contacts with the gongzi of the Li family in the town, and it was even seen to have the Li family's maid delivered him something. The Li family was a wealthy family, and further up, Li Yuanwai in the county town is their own family and had a good relationship with the county magistrate.Du Hehua refused to pay back the money, and looked like she had swallowed it up. It was because of this reliance.There were quarrels and fights. Since the marriage couldn't be concluded, Shen Xuanqing and Wei Lanxiang discussed it, and they didn't want to entangle them any more.Who would have guessed that even if Bao Zhiru came forward, Du Hehua would be reluctant to live or die, rolling around on the ground, crying and saying that he had no money, and scolding Lu Daxiang and Lu Gu in his mouth, but Lu Daxiang was a coward. Yes, the dowry money was all in Du Hehua's hands, and he didn't know where it was hidden. He just kept patting his legs and pacing, constantly shaking his head and sighing, saying that he had done something wrong.Where was the Shen family willing to make concessions, it was a full 20 taels of silver.The fulang was not married, and was cheated of money. Wei Lanxiang was almost crying, and Bao Zhiru was a witness. Since the Lu family refused to pay back the money, they would repay the debt with things.When the men in Qingxi Village heard that they were going to move the Lu family's belongings, they were all young people, all of them rolling up their sleeves and gearing up, unable to hide their excitement.Du Hehua was dumbfounded all of a sudden. She never thought that the Shen family would do this, but asking her to take out twenty taels was more painful than cutting her flesh. After such a hesitation, everyone from Qingxi Village broke into the house. inside.Shen Yaoqing strolled around the kitchen, trying to find the place where Du Hehua hid the money, but found nothing. He remembered that Lu Wen was gone, maybe the 20 taels were on Lu Wen.And if the money was really hidden somewhere in the Lu family, Du Hehua would definitely stop him from entering the house, so as not to be found by them, but Du Hehua didn't do that.In the end, he had to endure the bad breath and started to carry things. Tableware and chopsticks were not uncommon. He simply removed the iron pot from the stove, which was worth a little money.Lu Gu was still hiding in the firewood room, listening to the sound of rummaging boxes outside, and a few men smashing doors and bowls, clamoring that the Lu family didn't even have any valuables.Lu Daxiang and Du Hehua stopped this and the other, crying.In the end, it was Bao Zhiru who came forward to talk and stop the people who smashed things, saying that they were asked to move things to pay off their debts, not bandits and robbers.Lu Gu regained his senses at this moment, and his mind could turn, but when he heard the voice of his stepmother, he trembled. When the Shen family left, Du Hehua was so angry that he would definitely take her anger out to him.He shrank into the haystack, jumping into a river was the most sturdy thing he had ever done, but once that determination passed, he no longer had the courage to seek death, he just felt tired, and he didn't know if how long to linger.If it was really good, not bad, Du Hehua cried and scolded him in the firewood room. She couldn't stop the men who were carrying things, and she was pushed to the brink. The hatred in her heart reminded her of Lu Gu.\"You are a murderer, why don't you die!\" She took out a piece of firewood and hit Lu Gu.Lu Gu subconsciously wanted to hide, but when he heard the dead word, the last light in his eyes disappeared. He lowered his head and said nothing, allowing Du Hehua to beat him.The stick that used to hit him came to his head, and Lu Gu was hit by a stick, and his ears were buzzing. After the dizziness passed, he noticed that something was flowing down from his forehead, and soon his cheeks were wet.In a trance, he heard Wei Lanxiang's angry voice, saying that these things were depreciated and sold, adding up, not even ten taels of silver.Hearing this, Du Hehua threw the wooden stick in his hand, walked out of the firewood room, pointed at Wei Lanxiang with his hands on his hips and yelled at Wei Lanxiang. After scolding, she played a rogue. If Shen Xuanqing took advantage of Lu Gu, the Shen family must give it to him. She said that not a single thing was allowed to be taken away, and she had to compensate Lu Gu for the money that he had been prostituted for. Otherwise, she would shake this matter out and make the Shen family shameless. Didn't even think about marrying a wife and fulang.Her words were too vulgar, Ji Qiuyue hurriedly pulled her sister-in-law Shen Yan out, so as not to be insulted by these words.How could Wei Lanxiang let her son carry this stigma, didn't marry Lu Wen, and found another good marriage for Shen Xuanqing in the future, and she must not be ruined by the splashing dirty water.The people watching the fun knew that Du Hehua jumped off the wall in a hurry and started talking nonsense, but even if it was a rumor, once it spread, it could be slanderous.The Shen family was anxious to argue, but Lu Gu, who came out of the woodshed holding the door, spoke first.He glanced at Du Hehua, then Lu Daxiang, then looked at the others in the yard, and said, \"I didn't even say a word to Shen Xuanqing, let alone anything else.\"Lu Gu's voice was not loud, because he was a little weak after being beaten again, but as soon as he came out, his face was covered in blood, which made everyone quiet and heard his words.When Du Hehua beat him in the firewood room just now, no one heard it, and it was not a big deal for the mother to beat the child. Who would have known that Du Hehua would be so ruthless.Lu Gu looked at Lu Daxiang and continued to say, \"You want to be greedy for those 20 taels. If you don't want to go back, you will frame the bitter master. How can there be people like you in the world?\"Blood filled his eyes, and his eyes were filled with blood . He came down and blinked lightly, his pale lips moved, and he wanted to say something else, but he fell down as soon as his eyes darkened, and he lost consciousness again.\"Quick, save people.\" The yard became chaotic, and the people watching the excitement outside were all startled, thinking he was about to die, but Du Hehua's face was ashen, and she didn't see any anxiety.She repeatedly slandered Shen Xuanqing for occupying Lu Gu, which was no different from forcing Lu Gu on the road to death. A shuang'er was told by his family that he had lost his innocence, and it was rumored so that Lu Gu would never think of the day when he would look up in his life.Even Du Hehua mentioned this for his sake, but Lu Daxiang didn't say a word and let Lu Gu to see this father completely.He couldn't live, but the Shen family was innocent and had been deceived for no reason.In the chaos, Shen Xuanqing, who frowned, was not far from Lu Gu. At the juncture of life and death, how could he think about so many taboos? He stepped forward in two or three steps and carried Lu Gu on his back with the help of Wei Lanxiang and a few others, ran towards the house of the doctor in Anjia Village.\u2014\u2014In the strong smell of medicine, Lu Gu, who had a linen cloth wrapped around his head, opened his eyes. He stared at the roof, and only when he heard the sound of ooh ooh outside did his sluggish eyes move.Someone pushed open the door and came in, and he was relieved to see that he woke up, it was the wife of the doctor, and Lu Gu knew where he was.\"Grandma Wang.\" He called out subconsciously and wanted to sit up.Grandma Wang hurried over to hold him down and said, \"Don't move, rest again, it's not serious.\"Lu Gu heard that it was Lu Daxiang who was shouting in pain outside. He had doubts, but he didn't have the strength to ask again. Grandma Wang heard the movement outside, and whispered to him that Shen Xuanqing had broken his leg, and he was just getting his bone treatment.\"Either way, the young man is just too frizzy. When his eyes turn red, he won't know the severity of his attack.\" Grandma Wang babbled while pouring water.He helped Lu Gu to drink a few sips of warm water, hesitated for a while, with an unbearable look on her face, and said, \"Lu Gu, it's not that grandma scare you, in the future at the Shen family, remember to stay low and be small, don't dare to contradict others.Seeing Lu Gu bewildered, she put down the bowl and looked even more indignant: \"Du Hehua, who has a black heart, sold you to the Shen family!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He only said goodbye to Grandma Wang and the doctor, and went out and walked in the front.Lu Gu subconsciously glanced at Grandma Wang beside him. He was pale and lacking in energy. Grandma Wang couldn't bear the helpless looks in his lonely eyes, but Lu Gu had already been sold to the Shen family, so he had to go back to them.Outside, Shen Xuanqing didn't hear the footsteps behind him. Looking back, Lu Gu's eyes seemed to tremble, and he quickly followed.The two walked one after the other, detoured from the back of The doctor's house to a path, and this path was closer than the right path. The Lu family lived at the front of the village, so that they didn't have to see the Lu family again.Lu Gu was in a trance, and the further he walked, he suddenly turned his head to look in the direction of Anjia Village, as if in a dream, he escaped from his stepmother, Du Hehua, but there was no joy in his heart . Shen Xuanqing, who was so tall that he was afraid, didn't even dare to approach, how would he live in the future?.The sun sank in the west and gradually descended towards the mountain. He followed Shen Xuanqing's shadow. After he fully understood his situation, he also realized that his trance was not fake, but caused by dizziness. But he didn't dare to stop, didn't dare to say anything, he gritted his teeth and followed.Before Lu Daxiang stepped out of the hospital door, he turned his head and stared at Du Hehua, his face was black, but Du Hehua was not afraid at all.Du Hehua only brought him the old patched clothes, the wedding shoes on his feet were still wet, and it was a little uncomfortable to walk, but patience was something he often experienced. He kept following without even saying a word.Shen Xuanqing in the front was carrying the medicine bag. Today was originally the big day for his marriage, but it became like this. No one would look good on him.And the fact that he bought Lu Gu had to start half an hour ago.\u2014\u2014After Lu Gu was carried away by Shen Xuanqing, Du Hehua had a livid face, she was used to beat and scold Lu Gu, who would have thought that being slapped by Lu Gu today, how could she bear it, so she whispered in Lu Daxiang's ear and said about how Lu Gu made his father embarrassed in front of the villagers, and that they were coveting the money of the Shen family, it was unfilial, and he didn't take Lu Daxiang seriously.Lu Daxiang was originally unhappy because she beat Lu Gu to the point of blood and made others saw the joke. Hearing this, his face became worse, but he didn't say anything. His face was calm, and he was about to go to the doctor's house. After all, Lu Gu was his shuang'er son, and he didn't even look at him, which would only cause more gossip behind his back.Du Hehua saw his unspoken and useless appearance, and went out to see that wild species.She sneered secretly, walked over quickly, raised her head and squinted at Lu Daxiang and said in a low voice, \"You have a good heart, you have raised a good shuang'er, and today, together with others poured dirty water on Brother Wen, you will be able to tell him tomorrow. The ancestors of the old Lu family were scolded, and the ancestors will be annoyed to see him, and I don't know which wild man's seed made you a green-headed bastard!\"The people from Qingxi Village were still in the yard. Wei Lanxiang looked at the two people at the door and didn't know what they were saying in a low voice.Even Lu Daxiang, who was about to go out, turned back, took the dry tobacco rod from his waist, squatted on the wall and took a few puffs, the smoke enveloped his hazy folded face, and he looked a little older than before. When he thought of it, Du Hehua's words made him even more unhappy, and even more hatred for Lu Gu, this wild species.Wei Lanxiang hadn't left, just to prevent the Lu family from cheating on the account, so naturally they had to guard, the money wouldn't come back, but they had to take the things.After Shen Xuanqing came back, he learned that Lu Gu had no worries about his life, and the people of Qingxi Village would go back after moving the things.Wei Lanxiang looked at these rubbish things, which were not worth twenty taels at all, but Shen Xuanqing told her to go home, she sighed and had to give up, the Lu family was shameless, and their family had to live a good life.Before the things were moved, Du Hehua blocked the door and wouldn't let him go, pointed at Shen Xuanqing's nose and scolded him for being shameless, went out with a disheveled shuang'er on his back, and then scolded Wei Lanxiang and the rest of the Shen family.Lu Daxiang stopped smoking, spit on the ground, got up and looked at Shen Xuanqing with a very bad look, but he didn't scold, only asked if Shen Xuanqing took advantage of Lu Gu, otherwise, how would he go out carried Lu Gu behind his back? .He no longer trusted Lu Gu, so he naturally wore a pair of trousers with Du Hehua.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Those eyes were like a wolf leopard with a fierce coldness, so he suddenly shut his mouth.Lu Daxiang was carried away. Du Hehua was going to follow, but she was afraid that the house would be evacuated. Thinking of Lu Daxiang's broken leg this time, he would have to spend a lot of money for treatment, plus Lu Gu, he felt hatred in her heart.Lu Daxiang had to spend money, but Lu Gu, at this moment, she wished Lu Gu would die now, and she wouldn't pay a penny. Since it was Shen Xuanqing's hands, he must lose money!When it came to money, Du Hehua's mind turned faster than anyone else, and immediately corrupted the Shen family.Who knew that after she was crying and rushing to attract Bao Zhiru again, Shen Xuanqing kicked the iron pot on the ground, and said in a cold voice that they didn't want the things. The Lu family compensated him for 10 taels of silver. As for the remaining 10 taels, for the money he bought Lu Gu, and since then the two would no longer communicate. If not, then no one would think about it.Du Hehua was originally unwilling, but after seeing Shen Xuanqing's cold and terrifying expression, she gritted her teeth and agreed.The reason why she was able to agree was also calculated in her heart. Not only did she keep these belongings, but she could also throw Lu Gu, the death star, otherwise she would have to spend more money to treat the death star.\u2014\u2014Before dark, Lu Gu followed Shen Xuanqing to Qingxi Village.The red hanging on the beam on the door of Shen's house hadn't been taken off, and the yard had been cleaned up.Wei Lanxiang was out of breath today, and when she came back, she had a stuffy chest and a headache, so she went into the room early to rest.Ji Qiuyue took Shen Yan to clean up in the kitchen, and when she heard the movement, she looked out the window. She lost the usual smile on her face and asked through the window: \"Second brother is hungry, Daqing is going to return the table and chairs, wait. We will have dinner when he comes back.\"\"Yeah.\" Shen Xuanqing agreed, sounding a little dull. Seeing that there were still a few tables in the yard, he was going to move, but after noticing the red clothes on his body, he went to the room to change the clothes first.As for Lu Gu, he didn't even know where he should stand. Ji Qiuyue saw that his face was terrifyingly pale, and the fine linen cloth wrapped around his head was oozing red blood, and she couldn't help feeling pity, and said, \"There's no chair, you go and sit first.\"Lu Gu had nowhere to go. He just sat under the eaves according to her words, his hands and feet were cramped, but he didn't dare to make a big move.Shen Xuanqing, who had changed into home clothes, saw him when he came out, and didn't say anything and went to work on his own.As for whether Lu Gu came to the Shen family to live or die, he never thought about it.Although he changed his place, Lu Gu still felt that everything in front of him was unfamiliar, and no one wanted to see him, and they didn't want to pay attention to him.However, he didn't feel sorry for himself, and he didn't understand what it was. He was only at a loss. After thinking about what Grandma Wang said, he decided to be more careful and not make mistakes, especially not to let Shen Xuanqing find out what was wrong, otherwise his legs would be interrupted.The aroma of the food wafted out of the kitchen, especially the smell of meat, which made Lu Gu, who had only eaten a bowl of noodle soup all day, even more uncomfortable.Ji Qiuyue brought out a bowl of egg custard and brought it to Wei Lanxiang's room. Seeing Lu Gu's restrained and uneasy look, she sighed in her heart, and then said: \"Daqing and the others are coming back soon, you and Shen Yan will bring the dishes first.\"Seeing Lu Gu hurriedly entering the kitchen, she shook her head secretly, it wasn't that she deliberately instructed Lu Gu to work, not letting him move, sitting here with eyes full of nervousness , it was really unbearable, it was better to let him do something.Soon, the Shen brothers came back, and Lu Gu and Shen Yan also arranged the meals.In the main room, the Shen family members who sat down one after another were much more silent than before. It was Shen Yaoqing who spoke first and said, \"Eat, you can't go hungry in your own home, and the big things will wait until you eat.\"Shen Xuan Qing said nothing, but picked up the chopsticks, and Ji Qiuyue moved the chopsticks too. She glanced at the outside yard and asked Shen Yan, \"Where's the person?\"Wei Lanxiang fell asleep after eating a bowl of egg custard in the room. She didn't eat with them, but Lu Gu disappeared.\"It was still there just now.\" Shen Yan also looked into the yard.\"You eat first, I'll look for him.\" Ji Qiuyue put down her chopsticks again. To be honest, she was so pissed off today that she didn't have a good appetite.There were no chairs under the eaves, and no one in the kitchen. Finally, she found Lu Gu in the firewood room, pushed open the door and asked, \"Why don't you come to eat?\"Lu Gu, who was curled up in the haystack, covered his stomach to keep himself from going. Wanting to eat, he never thought that the door of the firewood room was suddenly opened, he sat up in a little panic, and subconsciously opened his eyes wide to look at Ji Qiuyue.After hearing what Qing Ji Qiuyue said, his expression became more and more panicked.In the Shen family he ate the hot egg noodle soup, which was much better than the watery soup left over from the Lu family, but there were only five bowls, and the five members of the Shen family naturally didn't have his share.After serving the table, he left the main room, not knowing where he should go. If he was still in Anjia Village, if his father and stepmother would have dinner. He was instructed to go out to work, so he ran to the hillside of the back mountain to pick some wild vegetables. He ate the fruit, but he didn't dare to run around in the Shen's house. In the end, he could only find a firewood room to sleep and endure the hunger, and he was able to ease his dizziness.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After coming for dinner with Ji Qiuyue, he realized that Wei Lanxiang didn't come out to eat, and that the bowl of noodles that no one touched belonged to him.Shen Xuanqing ate fast, and he finished eating in seconds. He put down the bowl and went back to the room first.After only Lu Gu and Shen Yan were left on the table, he took a breath and was no longer so stiff and nervous, but after all, he didn't dare to move the dishes on the table, and lowered his head and only ate noodles and soup, which was far better than what he had eaten before. It would be better.Suddenly, there was a piece of pork liver in the bowl. Lu Gu was stunned for a while, and when he turned his head, he saw that Shen Yan held up the chopsticks and hadn't retracted his hand.\"It's so much, it's okay for you to eat a few mouthfuls.\" Shen Yan's almond eyes were clear, but she seemed a little unfamiliar and cautious because she was not familiar with him.The same was true for Lu Gu, because he was too timid and looked a little dull, even unable to speak.Fortunately, Shen Yan didn't care about this, she was full and got up to clean up her tableware.Lu Gu hurriedly ate the meat and noodles in his bowl. He was a little bit at a loss, and he felt remorse in his heart. Why did he eat so slowly? If Shen Xuanqing knew about it, he would suffer.He completely forgot that he was late and others ate earlier than him, for fear that if he didn't work diligently, he only knew that eating would annoy the Shen family.\"I'll wash it.\" His voice was low, and he gently took the empty bowl from Shen Yan's hand.When he was in the Lu family, it was often not his turn to eat, but he had to wash the dishes. Lu Wen was determined not to do it, not to mention his half-brother Lu Wu, who now had changed his place. He didn't dare to slack off.There was a lot of food left over tonight, and the angry Shen family didn't have much appetite, they were full after filling their stomachs.Shen Yan didn't grab him. Besides, seeing how pale he was and how thin he was , he seemed to be frightened if she spoke louder, so she didn't dare to speak more.Ji Qiuyue, the leftover vegetables and meat from the wedding banquet, had already put them away, and Lu Gu put the leftovers in the cage, his eyes fell on the basin that hadn't been poured after washing the vegetables, and he asked Shen Yan who came after him softly, \"Is this the basin? \"Seeing that Shen Yan nodding, he put the empty bowls and chopsticks in, squatted down and took the loofah and started to wash.Shen Yan seemed to be curious about him, and squatted down opposite him.Lu Gu spoke less and was timid, but Shen Yan was still a little girl, and she had no bad intentions. She just gave him some meat to eat, so he was not so vigilant and nervous about Shen Yan.He was stupid, and he was afraid of saying the wrong thing, so he buried himself to hide his helplessness.And Shen Yan tilted her head and looked at the bride in front of her. She thought that Lu Gu was not as good-looking as Lu Wen, but her eyebrows and eyes were not that bad, but she was too thin. What a nice person.But when she thought of Lu Wen's repentance of marriage and Du Hehua scolding them, she felt that Lu Wen was not very good. If she were to meet Lu Wen in the future, she would never give him a good look. How could there be such a person.At this time, Ji Qiuyue came in. She was full after eating a few mouthfuls. She went back to her room and rested for a while. She heard that there was no movement in the main room outside.Seeing a wounded person washing dishes, she wanted to talk to Shen Yan, but she felt really tired today, and Shen Yan was also frightened today, so she stopped talking.Besides, she could also see Lu Gu's embarrassment. If he didn't do some work, he probably wouldn't even know where to put his hands and feet. Washing the dishes wasn't such a big job.She took another wooden basin from the side, scooped out the clean water and put Lu Gu's washed bowl into it and rinsed it.Someone helped, and Lu Gu quickly finished washing. Just as he was about to take out the dirty water and pour it out, Ji Qiuyue grabbed it first. He had no work to do, so he stood in the kitchen and stared blankly for a while.Ji Qiuyue put the empty basin away and said to him, \"you're tired today, just scoop some water to wash and go to sleep.\"Lu Gu, Shen Yan closed the courtyard door, and followed Ji Qiuyue to wash in the courtyard together. Wiping her face and turning her head, she saw Lu Gu's pitiful and cramped look, pointed to her own basin and said, \"How about you use mine?\"After speaking, she remembered that there was a new wooden basin for the newcomer in the second brother's room. But she thought about it again, it should have been for Lu Wen.Although the second brother said that he bought Lu Gu, she really didn't know what identity Lu Gu was at home.\"Forget it, you can use this.\" Shen Yan couldn't understand this matter, and there was a bit of sadness on her round face.There were many trivial matters in getting married. The whole Shen family woke up to work from dawn, and in the afternoon, they went to Anjia Village to quarrel and fight with others. It was not an exaggeration to say that they were physically and mentally exhausted.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The surroundings were so quiet that he felt as if he was alone.He was dumbfounded, stared at the bright moon for a long time, and finally thought to himself, wait until the fifteenth full moon to go to the grave, otherwise if he died, no one would go to his mother's grave.\u2014\u2014The sun was rising, and the sky was already bright. In the Shen's firewood room, Shen Yan squatted in front of the haystack, stretched out a finger and gently poked the face of the person in the haystack.Lu Gu, with the blood-stained linen cloth wrapped around his head, didn't wake up. She was a little startled. She subconsciously reached out and probed his nose for a while, and then she was relieved after breathing lightly.The rest of the Shen family also got up. Shen Xuanqing was washing his face when Wei Lanxiang called him into the room.\"Mother.\" He said while wiping his hands with the towel.Wei Lanxiang leaned on the square pillow and sighed lightly when she saw her second son, and then asked, \"What are you going to do with him?\"It was self-evident who this \"he\" was.Hearing this, Shen Xuanqing frowned slightly, obviously not thinking about it. After thinking for a while, he said, \"Mother, it's him.\"Although it was an expected answer, Wei Lanxiang lowered her eyes in anger. She couldn't even express her remorse, and her face was full of unwillingness and discomfort.Shen Xuanqing knew what his old lady was thinking. She originally wanted to marry him a good fulang, but he became Lu Gu, but after this incident, he no longer had any thoughts and expectations for marriage, and whispered: \" I owe 10 taels of silver from my uncle's house and said that it will be repaid in May of next year. Let's not mention this. It will be the New Year's Day in half a year, and I will need money. When will it be clear?\"\"Alas.\" Wei Lanxiang sighed, how could she not understand this truth, she was just unwilling.For Shen Xuanqing's marriage this time, the 20 taels of dowry could barely get together, but the marriage was not only a dowry, but also other expenses. After the account was calculated, the money in her hand was not enough to see, so she could only borrow from her mother's family. From the eldest brother got 10 taels of silver.In fact, if Shen Xuanqing was unwilling to ask Lu Gu, it was not impossible to find the money when the debt was repaid, but the men in the countryside who couldn't marry a wife when they were old would be ridiculed, and the older they were, the worse and would be hard to find.When Wei Lanxiang saw the expression in her second son's eyes, she knew that he had made a decision. No matter what, it was not too bad to take Lu Gu to make up the number, the money was gone, at least he could get a person.She rubbed her forehead and said, \"Okay, I understand, you can go to work.\"At this point, when Lu Gu was asleep, he became Shen Xuanqing's fulang, not what he thought last night, he was bought to be The Shen servants of cattle and horses.What Shen Xuanqing didn't say was that if he changed someone, he wouldn't necessarily want it. The reason why he recognized Lu Gu was because of the few words of conscience that Lu Gu said yesterday, which made him understand that he was different with other Lu family members.It was precisely because of those words with blood on his face that the rest of the Shen family didn't have that much resistance to Lu Gu. Besides, he was not the one who broke their hearts and lungs.in the firewood room.The drowsy Lu Gu woke up because of the poke on his cheek. After he saw Shen Yan's face clearly, he realized that it was already bright outside, and his bloodless face changed a bit with fright, and he was about to get up immediately. Go out to boil water and to work.Who would have known that he got up too quickly, and before he could stand firm, it was black in front of him. If it wasn't for Shen Yan's quick hands and eyes to support him, he might have fallen.\"What are you in a hurry for? There's no ghost driving you.\" Shen Yan was puzzled, she helped him sit down again, and took a few hay from his hair.After the darkness in front of him passed, Lu Gu was no longer dizzy, he stood up.Shen Yan followed him out of the firewood room, and said as he walked, \"Your medicine is fried, you can drink it after eating.\"The yard was filled with an unpleasant smell of medicine, and others helped him decoct the medicine, this matter made Lu Gu very unfamiliar. When he was at home, once he was sick, he would either get over it, or went to the backyard to make medicine by himself, and his stepmother would scold him when the smell of the medicine came out.Shen Xuanqing came out of the room and saw the bloodless face, and his feet froze.Last night, he heard the slight movement of Lu Gu opening the door of the firewood room. At that time, he was upset. He turned over a few times and felt that as long as no one ran away, he wouldn't care. Besides, it would be inappropriate for a shuang'er to be called into the room by him.As for Lu Gu just woke up just now, he understood. Yesterday, he was hit and his head was bleeding. His body was thin. there was nothing wrong.After seeing Shen Xuanqing, Lu Gu obviously showed a bit of cowardice, and even stopped when he was going to work in the kitchen.At this time, Wei Lanxiang shouted in the room: \"Shen Yan, go and put the chicken out, it's getting late.\"\"I know mother, I'll go now.\" Shen Yan replied, and she threw the chicken in her hand and played with it. She took the bamboo basket hanging under the kitchen eaves and walked to the backyard. When she came, she looked at Shen Xuanqing, thinking in her heart what the position of Lu Gu in their house would be in the future.The somewhat familiar Shen Yan left, which made Lu Gu even more uneasy, and almost wrote the fear of Shen Xuanqing on his face.Fortunately, Ji Qiuyue stood by the kitchen window and looked out, and said to Lu Gu, \"Wash your face and bring the food in.\"Shen Xuanqing realized his fear and frowned slightly, but he still entered the main room, otherwise Lu Gu's head would drop to the ground.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There were fish and meat. They were all leftover materials from the wedding banquet, not leftovers from others.It was not easy for farmers. Where could you eat such big fish and meat easily? You couldn't care about the rest after sitting in the feast, hurriedly poured it into his own bowl and took it away.Now it was summer again, although it was almost the end of summer, but the weather was still hot, and things were easy to spoil, so you had to eat them quickly, so as not to feel bad if they became bad.Everyone on the table had a bowl of chicken soup, which was flattering for Lu Gu, and he became more and more confused.The Shen family bought him probably because he wanted to let out his breath, but since last night, he neither beat him nor scolded him , gave him food, and even gave him a bowl of oily and fragrant chicken soup today.When Ji Qiuyue saw him, he didn't dare to eat a single bite of the food. She was not angry. After a night of rest, she regained her energy. Just now, she took advantage of Lu Gu's opportunity to serve food and asked Shen Xuanqing what he meant, and she knew that Lu Gu was the new fulang.Although it was still difficult for her to take a straight look at the Lu family, when she thought about how Lu Gu was beaten up like that, it would be hard to believe if she hadn't seen the injuries on his body, so she softened a bit and said briskly, \"Eat the vegetables quickly, if you eat them later, it will be bad in two days, so hurry up and eat now. \"Lu Gu was persuaded, but still didn't dare to stretch out his chopsticks. Ji Qiuyue didn't urge him much when he saw this, people's temperament couldn't be changed in a moment.Shen Xuanqing and Shen Yaoqing ate fast and a lot. After all, young men were strong and had good appetite.\"I'll go to the ground for a walk.\" Shen Yaoqing stood up first, said to Ji Qiuyue, and left the table.As for Shen Xuanqing, he originally thought that he would stay at home for the past few days after getting married, and waited for the three days to return to the door before packing up and went into the mountain, but seeing Lu Gu bowing his head and didn't dare to speak, he thought about it and arrived at the backyard.With only the three of them left on the table, Lu Gu's tense body relaxed a little.\"There's so much more, let's eat them separately, don't leave any leftovers.\" Ji Qiuyue moved the vegetable bowl to the three of them.Shen Yan was full, she had a small appetite, and it was hard to put things in the hot weather now. When she saw that Lu Gu didn't move his chopsticks, she couldn't eat anyway, just like last night, she put a few pieces of fish in Lu Gu's bowl and then the meat.Before Lu Gu ate it, he suddenly saw three dogs running out of the backyard, smelling the smell of meat and heading straight to the main room.The two thin dogs had smooth fur, long legs and slender waists, and were taller than ordinary dogs. At first glance, they ran fast, and the exposed fangs immediately reminded Lu Gu of the words a vicious biting dog.not to mention, a big wolf-dog followed closely behind them, with strong limbs and a well-proportioned body. It didn't look like a dog, but a half-human tall wolf running out of the mountains.However, compared to the two small dogs, this big dog's gray-blue eyes drooped slightly. After walking in, its eyes turned around in the main room. Even if it found Lu Gu, a stranger, it just came around and sniffed. It went away, as if it had memorized the smell, and then walked to the shady place under the eaves and lay on his stomach. Both its movements and demeanor seemed very calm, but it was not so scary.When Lu Gu slept last night, he heard a dog barking in the backyard, but he didn't expect that the Shen family had three dogs, and they were all so tall and so big.\"Go!\" Ji Qiuyue raised her hand and waved away the two thin dogs that were circling Lu Gu.At this time, Shen Xuanqing came out of the backyard, he gave the drink, and the three dogs followed after him walked outside.When the Shen family saw that he didn't bring anything else, they knew that they wouldn't enter the deep mountains, but chased rabbits and pheasants on the periphery.\"I'm full.\" Shen Yan said, and took away the empty bowls. When she came to the kitchen, she added a piece of fine wood under the medicine stove and let them boiled slowly.Half a bowl of mixed rice, a bowl of fragrant and warm chicken soup, Shen Yan also filled him with some meat and vegetables, the first time Lu Gu filled his stomach after a long absence .The stomach was full and warm, and even the heart, liver, spleen, lungs and kidneys seemed to be warm, which gave him a bit of energy.Ji Qiuyue was busy in the kitchen after the meal. She was used to it and didn't let Lu Gu intervene. It happened that the medicine was ready at this time, so she took a bowl and poured it out.The hot medicine was difficult to swallow, so she had to put it aside to let it cooled down.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Seeing that Lu Gu had nothing to do, she had no one to accompany the ducks, so she asked, \"Are you going?\"He paid for it at home, and it was natural to work, so Lu Gu followed Shen Yan out of the house in a hurry.\"The pond is not far, just behind the house.\" Shen Yan said as she walked.Qingxi Village was close to the mountain, and the Shen family was the last family in the village. The Qingxi River that flowed out of the mountain was only half a mile behind the house. The two of them could see the river at a glance when they walked behind the house, and there was a small pond.After driving the ducks into the pond, Shen Yan didn't sit still. She looked for grass that chickens like to eat nearby, especially those with grass seeds, which chickens like to peck. Chopped it up and mixed with the bran to feed the chicken, the chicken was cute when they ate.Seeing Lu Gu swaying when he bent down and stood up, she thought it was because of a head injury. She pointed to a white stone on the edge of the pond where she used to sit and said, \"Sit here and don't move , take a bamboo pole and don't let the ducks go away. Just let them swim and I'll go there to cut the grass.\"Lu Gu sat down, he didn't dare to be lazy, but as soon as he squatted, his eyes became dark and his head was dizzy, so he had to wait for a while.In the distance, he heard a few dogs barking from the hillside, and immediately remembered the three dogs that followed Shen Xuanqing out .Sure enough, it was them.Walking towards the hillside, more trees would grow, Lu Gu could see Shen Yan's figure, two thin dogs rushed down from the hillside, thinking that Shen Xuanqing was nearby.Lu Gu didn't dare to look over there anymore, and looked at the ducks swimming in the pond looking for food.Soon, Shen Yan came over with a bale of grass. Seeing that the ducks were all there, she said to Lu Gu, \"Brother Lu Gu, Brother Erqing said the sun is getting hot, so let you go back.\"It was the first time that Shen Yan called him brother . Even if Lu Gu's expression was embarrassed. He didn't say much, just asked: \"What about the duck?\"Shen Yan pointed to the side of the hill and said, \"Just let Da Hui looking at it.\"Lu Gu followed her finger, and sure enough, the big wolf dog was walking towards the pond.\"Da Hui is so smart. The last time Brother Daqing's jacket fell on the ground, it brought it home.\" Shen Yan and Lu Gu became familiar with each other, and their words gradually increased. Besides, she met Shen Xuanqing just now. Her brother told her that Lu Gu was the newlyweds, so his identity was naturally different, so she should also talk about family affairs.As soon as the two of them entered the door, Ji Qiuyue saw it and said, \"Just right, the medicine is ready to drink.\"After Lu Gu finished drinking the medicine, he was pulled into the new room by Shen Yan.He knew that this was Shen Xuanqing's room, and he was at a loss immediately, and he didn't know why.\"Second brother said, let you drink the medicine and sleep for a while, anyway, to recover from the injury.\" Shen Yan saw that he was still wearing the shabby clothes that Du Hehua gave yesterday, and opened the box dowry to search the new clothes.Farmers didn't have many good things for dowry, and they usually put the clothes that Shuang'er often wore in his parents' house, so the dowry looked full.At that time, the Lu family had agreed to give a new quilt, but they were not fooled. Otherwise, the box wouldn't be too light, and the people who moved it from Qingxi Village in the past would shout about it.Shen Yan only found two pieces of Lu Gu's clothes in the box, but none of them were winter clothes. How could she didn't know that they were deducted by Du Hehua.\"Are you going to change?\" She turned to ask Lu Gu, saw him nodding and said, \"Then you can sleep here, or Brother Erqing will scold me when he comes back.\"Last night, Brother Erqing entered the room, she actually thought that Lu Gu wouldn't dare to go in, but she and Wei Lanxiang lived in the same room and couldn't call Lu Gu.If it was cold, there was an excuse, but it was still summer. Besides, she didn't know what Shen Xuanqing meant yesterday, and her mother was so angry again, how could she dare to make up her own mind.After Shen Yan finished speaking, she went out and closed the door for him.Lu Gu hugged his clothes in panic, unable to figure out why. If he was more courageous, he might have guessed a little bit, but he wasn't, he could only do what Shen Yan said, after all, it was what Shen Xuanqing meant.When he was about to change his clothes, he glanced at the bed covered with red quilts. It was clean and tidy, far from being soiled by him, so he went to wash his face and hands, and even his feet and calves were washed with water with his hands. There was no cloth towel here, so he had to sit in the courtyard to dry.Fortunately, Shen Xuanqing and Shen Yaoqing were not there, and the sun was hot enough, so Lu Gu quickly dried.The night before yesterday, when he was still in the Lu family, according to the pre-marriage rules, Du Hehua reluctantly boiled a large pot of water for him, and let him take a bath, rubbing his body all over till red, but also completely clean and light.So when Lu Gu changed into clean clothes and lay down on the side of the bed carefully, he didn't have so much fear of soiling his new quilt. He lay down, only to feel that the mattress under him was extremely soft, and even had a faint scent.He didn't know that in order to marry the new fulang, the Shen family added boiled herb water to the water when washing the bed and the mattress. It smelled cleaner and it was a lot of thought.Lu Gu hadn't slept in such a good bed for a long time. In the Lu family, he and Lu Wen lived in the same room, and there was a broken wooden bed made of stone and mud. Even so, Du Hehua often drived him to the firewood room to sleep.Due to the injury on the forehead, he would feel dizzy from time to time, but he recovered quickly, and he didn't take it to heart, but now when he lay down, his body and mind were like falling into a soft mattress, and he gradually became drowsy.Lu Gu originally just wanted to lie down according to Shen Xuanqing's words, so that Shen Yan wouldn't have to be scolded. He didn't expect that he would fall asleep, and he slept so deeply that he didn't even feel anything when Ji Qiuyue came in to cover him with a thin quilt.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When she saw Ji Qiuyue coming out of the new room, she lowered her eyes and sewed her pockets, and asked, \"How have you been seeing him in the past two days? \"Ji Qiuyue sat down beside her. Wei Lanxiang took out the half-finished shoe sole from the sewing basket beside her feet and put it away.\"Mother, at least be honest, he did whatever you let him do, didn't say anything, wrote everything on his face, his mind is much easier to guess than that Lu Wen.\"Ji Qiuyue's tone was brisk, because Lu Gu was still sleeping in the room, her voice was lower than usual , and she said, \"He likes to be clean, and he washed his face and feet before going to bed. I guess he is quite afraid of the second brother.\"After hearing, Wei Lanxiang shook her head, she had to admit it now, and said, \"It's good to be honest, as long as you do your duty. He can live with your second brother. Well, the courage still need to practice.\"\"That's right, mother, the second brother is less talkative, he looks like a first-class handsome man, and has a good temper. After waiting for a long time, he will naturally know it.\" Ji Qiuyue smiled. As she said this, one of her words was for her own family, and the other was that something Wei Lanxiang loved to listen.Sure enough, Wei Lanxiang smiled, and her face was no longer sad. She heard the hens clucking in the backyard and said, \"It's laying eggs. You look at them and pick the eggs, wait until tomorrow. Count ten eggs and then take a piece of meat and go back to see your mother.\"\"I know, mother.\" Ji Qiuyue said as she got up and went to get the basket hanging under the kitchen eaves, smiling all over her face.Her mother was ill a few days ago, but because she was busy with Shen Xuanqing's marriage, she only took a quick look.Everyone liked to listen to good things, she picked up what her mother-in-law liked to hear and said a few words, her mother-in-law was happy and she was happy, and Shen Yaoqing was also happy to see her made her mother-in-law happy, wasn't this better than anything else?Now the weather was hot, the hens didn't lay eggs well, and the price had gone up. Even in the past, it was not easy to eat. You had to save and sold them. These eggs could be regarded as precious things in the family. You could only eat a lot of things like this when you got married, and they still needed to save the eggs two months in advance for the last banquet.Ten eggs were a rarity anyway. Pork was too oily to eat. If you also brought these eggs, it would be enough to give to her mother to make up her body.Although she was going back to her parents' house, Ji Qiuyue took these back to save her face, and let her picky little sister-in-law have nothing to say.The others were busy with their own work, only Lu Gu slept all afternoon.When he opened his eyes again, he was stunned for a while before he completely woke up. He looked out of the courtyard from window and someone looked in. When Ji Qiuyue saw him woke up, she smiled and said, \"Wake up, let's have a good meal, I was thinking of calling you just now.\"The unhappiness at the Lu family yesterday had passed, since Lu Gu was chosen as a fulang, it was better for the family to live in harmony.After breakfast, he went to sleep, woke up and ate again. No one beat or scolded him. This was something that had never happened to Lu Gu, so he quickly went out to help, for fear of making mistake.After thinking about it, Wei Lanxiang finally felt lighter. She was sitting under the eaves and packing up the sewing basket. When Lu Gu came out, he saw her, and his face showed some fear and confusion, and he stopped in place.Ji Qiuyue saw that he was cramped, and remembered that no one had mentioned his affairs to Lu Gu, so she smiled and said, \"Don't call mother yet, mother asked me to steam a bowl of egg custard for you, you can't let the kindness in vain. \"Lu Gu was timid, he was timid only when he was frightened, and usually he would wink, otherwise he would have been beaten and scolded by Du Hehua for excuses.Hearing Ji Qiuyue said this, he opened his eyes slightly, as if he couldn't believe it, he hesitated and whispered, \"Mother.\"Wei Lanxiang was not someone who was acting like a mean mother-in-law, so she didn't deliberately make it difficult for Lu Gu. Seeing that Lu Gu was obedient in everything, so she nodded.The quacking sound of ducks came from the yard, Shen Yan carried a small basket, Shen Xuanqing followed behind her, and came back with two bales of grass on his back.Many people didn't dare to go into the deep mountains, so they often catched hares and pheasants on the periphery. It was because of this that the things on the outer mountains were rarer than before.Shen Yan threw the job of chasing the ducks to Shen Xuanqing, and brought the basket with fishes to Lu Gu. She had mud on her sleeves and pant, but her eyes were bright. She showed the fish in the basket to Lu Gu and said: \"Brother Lu Gu, look, this is what Brother Erqing and I caught. We will ate fish soup.\"There were some loach and small fish with long fingers in the basket. Although the appearance was not good, the fish soup was the best. Delicious, especially loach, it could also nourish the body.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Compared to yesterday's cloudy atmosphere, the family members had a bit of a smile on their faces, it made him also happy, and grabbed Shen Yan's little braid, asked, \"Have you had enough fun?\"The family's situation was not good in the past two years, and Shen Yan also followed suit. She kept ducks and grass every day, and sometimes she had to do some needlework. She couldn't even find time to play. Today, Shen Xuanqing didn't catch a rabbit, so he took her to the river to dig for loach. This was a rare fun for her, and she was naturally happy.\"Sister-in-law, look at him!\" Shen Yan was sore, and she knew that she couldn't beat him, so her brows were tangled together, and she hurriedly called Ji Qiuyue.With a soft sound of \"snap\", Shen Yaoqing was hit on the back of the head. After being beaten by his wife, he laughed and stopped messing with Shen Yan.A few loach fluttered in the basin, and the water splashed outside. Shen Yan used chopsticks to dip a few drops of oil into the basin, so that they could spit out the mud.The clouds in the evening were dyed orange, and the wind blew away the heat of the day. The family gathered to eat together, happily and harmoniously, which was a very unfamiliar scene for Lu Gu.In front of him was the only bowl of egg custard on the table, which Ji Qiuyue said was steamed for him alone.Without the distress of yesterday, Shen Yaoqing spoke more, and compared to his eldest brother who in his twenties, Shen Xuanqing, who was five years younger, spoke less prudently.Lu Gu felt that this bowl of egg custard was too precious, and he didn't dare to eat it at all, so he gave it to Wei Lanxiang and said, \"Mother, you eat.\"Although the voice of calling mother was small , he was still sensible, Wei Lanxiang was in a better mood, she had a two-point smile at Lu Gu, and pushed the bowl back.Because Shen Xuanqing had already recognized Lu Gu as the new fulang, and she wanted him to live with the second child in the future, so she casually said: \"No, I have eaten all these days. If you like to eat it, you can eat it, the injury will heal if you eat it, and in the future you will give it to us\u2026\u201dHaving said this, Wei Lanxiang suddenly felt bad, and quickly turned around: \"you will make it for our Erqing in the future. It's all up to you to do the food and laundry.\"What she originally wanted to say was to give birth to a big fat boy for Shen Xuanqing, but when the words got to her mouth, she knew it was not good, so she hurriedly took it back, but after all she heard it, Ji Qiuyue paused her chopsticks, her eyebrows drooping.\"Eat, eat, it's not good if it's cold.\" Shen Yaoqing rounded up the situation, and even put the vegetables in Ji Qiuyue's bowl as a show of flattery.Lu Gu didn't know what was going on, so he subconsciously held his breath, for fear that he would say a word or do something wrong and made others unhappy.He didn't know, Ji Qiuyue had been married for three years, and the family life was good when she first got married, but she didn't think that when Shen Shunfu was gone, and it became difficult. They couldn't even eat , and everyone had to work hard to earn money. For money, Shen Yaoqing discussed with her whether or not to have sex.Otherwise, the child would suffer and even adults would be dragged down. It was not easy to raise a child, not to mention for the confinement, and the milk may not be enough, so she hadn't made any movement in the past three years.Besides, she couldn't tell anyone about this. she couldn't say that my family was not living well and they couldn't afford it. When she said this, Shen Yaoqing had to slap himself a few times.The two of them didn't say much about this, but the rest of the Shen family knew a little of the reason, but outsiders didn't. For the farmers, getting married and having children was the same thing. Some gossip also entered her ears, which inevitably made her felt uncomfortable.Fortunately, Ji Qiuyue stopped lowering her head soon, and she regained her spirits. Wei Lanxiang knew she had said the wrong thing, and pushed her favorite dishes over there, saying, \"Qiuyue, you like to eat this rabbit meat, eat more.\"Shen Yaoqing was even more rude, and brought it directly to his wife, causing Ji Qiuyue to scold him.The sun set, and another day had passed.If you didn't work at night, naturally the lights wouldn't be lit for a long time. After dark, the Shen family went back to their room to rest and sleep.Lu Gu was lying upright on the bed, his entire figure seemed to be frozen, not daring to move at will.It stands to reason that after marrying, the shuang'er would sleep in the outer side. It was good to make it easier when they needed to pour tea and water for their husband at night, but Shen Xuanqing was used to sleep alone, and he felt uncomfortable when there was a person sleeping in the outer side, so he pushed him in.When entering the room, only the two of them were left when the door and windows were closed, and Lu Gu was almost frightened by the tall and strong man standing beside the bed.Speaking of which, he had never been so close to Shen Xuanqing, and even because of the overwhelming sense of oppression, he didn't dare to look at Shen Xuanqing's appearance, until today there was only a vague outline.He probably knew that Shen Xuanqing was cold and fierce, but as long as he didn't provoke him.As for his appearance, he was busy discussing life carefully, and he had to think about filling his stomach. He didn't even care what he looked like, let alone others.The two just lay together like this, and Lu Gu was barely breathing.The night was getting dark, and there were a few barks coming from the backyard, which soon subsided. He thought he would keep his eyes open all night, but as Shen Xuanqing by his side didn't make any big movements, his breathing gradually became steady, letting Lu Lu Gu slowly closed his eyes.The injury on the forehead hadn't healed yet, making him always felt dizzy, and his body had been depleted due to lack of food in recent years, so even if he slept all afternoon during the day, he finally fell asleep.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After all, he didn't oversleep, and he couldn't help but felt a little lucky.The words of Ji Qiuyue and Wei Lanxiang made him realize before he fell asleep last night that although he was sold to the Shen family, he was a little different from the servants of the wealthy families. He still became Shen Xuanqing's fulang.This was nothing compared to anything else. He never thought that he would still be a fulang one day, so he was a little caught off guard.Shen Xuanqing got up, and Lu Gu also sat up in panic, for fear of being told to be lazy. No one taught him how to serve his husband after he got married, and the hands on the thin quilt clenched subconsciously.Shen Xuanqing put on his shoes and went to the ground. To him, Lu Gu's existence was very obvious, after all, there was only one quilt at night. At this point, although he had completely falling out with the Lu family, Lu Gu was already his fulang, so it was always inappropriate to hang him in the cold.He stood beside the bed and saw that Lu Gu was nervous and his face turned pale. The linen wrapped around his head was a little loose because he slept all night, so he finally found the words and said, \"Wang Langzhong said that today we will change the dressing, get up and pack up, and go there while it's cool in the morning.\"Lu Gu nodded again and again, fearing that Shen Xuanqing would be unhappy if he didn't speak, he hurriedly said in a low voice, \"Okay.\"The fulang was even less courageous than a rabbit and Shen Xuanqing frowned, but fortunately, Lu Gu lowered his head and didn't see it, otherwise he would be terrified for several days.The Shen family got up one after another to wash up in the courtyard. Even Lu Gu used a new basin and even the green salt to clean his teeth and rinsed his mouth. This was originally prepared for marrying the new fulang. After all, Lu Wen had been studying in the town for a few days, and he had some common things in the town.When he was in the Lu family, the green salt that needed to spend money to buy was not Lu Gu's share. Afraid that people would say that the his teeth was dirty, he would break the willow branches, bite and chewed one in his mouth to clean his teeth.There was a faint wisp of smoke from the chimney, Ji Qiuyue boiled the water, and by the way, heated some miscellaneous flour steamed cakes .Normally, people in the village only ate two meals a day, unless when were busy with farming they ate three meals a day, and the Shen family had two young men who had a lot of work and had a big appetite. Otherwise, you wouldn't have the energy to work with an empty stomach.However, this was also because of the banquet recently, so they could eat like this, which would never happen in the past two years. Except for Shen Xuanqing and Shen Yaoqing, who ate two steamed cakes, the other four all had half of it . They ate too much oil and meat in the past few days, so they grabbed a bowl of small pickles and ate them.Breakfast in the morning was simple, there was no need to put chopsticks on the table, so Ji Qiuyue directly passed it by hand when she divided the cake, and even small pickles were pinched, and a few people squatted or stand in the yard to eat.Lu Gu held half of the steamed cake. The cake was soft and warm. After everyone else took it, he picked a small pickle from the bowl, imitating the rest of the Shen family to put it in the cake. It was salty and crispy in one bite, but it went well with the steamed cakes.He was able to drink a few sips of hot water and ate so early, and even he had a share, making Lu Gu felt a little grateful while he was panicking.Farmers rarely chewed and swallowed slowly their food, and the steamed cakes were not too big. Shen Xuanqing could solve it in three or two bites, and two cakes were enough for him early in the morning.Lu Gu had been secretly looking at him , and he ate fast, for fear of delaying the time to go out.\"Mother, I'll go to change the medicine with him.\" Shen Xuanqing said to Wei Lanxiang, and the two went out one after the other.It was early, the sun had just risen. This summer was hotter than before, but Qingxi Village was close to the mountains, so it was still a little chilly in the morning, but it wouldn't let people freeze.Lu Gu followed Shen Xuanqing out of the village and met several people along the way.The news of the Shen family spread in Qingxi Village, and everyone was curious. At this time, seeing a strange shuang'er following Shen Xuanqing, they guessed that it was another shuang'er of the Lu family, and they kept looking at him with their eyes.Anyone who shared this kind of thing felt aggrieved, and no one leaned forward to ask, wasn't this a bad thing, so they just quietly looked at him.Being stared at, Lu Gu's head lowered. If he hadn't been able to see Shen Xuanqing's legs and feet, he would have been trembling with fright.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Not many men came out. Although most of them were looking at Lu Gu, Shen Xuanqing noticed that someone was quietly looking at him.He didn't like being stared at, so he looked straight at him and asked, \"Uncle Lin will you go down to the ground early?\"The man shyly scratching his head and laughed haha: \"Yes, yes.\"Although what Shen Xuanqing said was a common question, he knew that he was restrained as soon as he opened his eyes with a wink, and his eyes fell on Lu Gu a lot less. The two didn't stop, and went straight out of the village towards Anjia Village.\u2014\u2014In Langzhong's house, Wang Langzhong took off the blood-stained linen cloth on Lu Gu's head and put the herbal medicine on his forehead again.[\u90ce\u4e2d l\u00e1ng zh\u014dng: doctor (Chinese medicine)]He knew a little about the pulse, and gave Lu Gu a diagnosis, then shook his head and sighed: \"The foundation is empty, it takes ten days for others, and it takes twenty days for you to recover from the injury, and you can't make it out for a while.\"Wang Langzhong was getting old, and seeing Lu Gu was so thin, he couldn't help but ramble, but Grandma Wang gave him a wink to tell him not to talk, and he stopped his mouth in shock after realizing it, and looked up to see Shen Xuanqing, his expression remained the same, and he was relieved that he didn't think of abandoning Lu Gu.Most people married a fulang to live a good life. It was not easy for peasants to marry a wife. Few were willing to marry a sick seedling and went back to drag them. Besides, Lu Gu was bought back by others. How could he care whether he could support himself or not, it was good if he was not thrown out.Once the medicine was finished, it was inconvenient to stay, and there were still various things to do when they went back. Shen Xuanqing asked Wang Langzhong when Lu Gu needed to come to change the medicine next time.It was said that the road for the enemy was narrow, and the path they took wouldn't pass in front of Lu's house, but who knew, they bumped into Du Hehua. She dig wild vegetables in the field behind the village, which was usually Lu Gu's job.In her eyes, how could she didn't complain if she did more work for nothing, and cursed a few words from time to time.She was afraid of Shen Xuanqing. Lu Daxiang was still lying in bed today, and no one would give her a head, so even if she resented Lu Gu, she was like the water mussels in the river, her mouth would be closed immediately, only after the two of them walked away, she turned back and spat on the ground.It was the most incompetent to hit a woman, Du Hehua didn't even flirt today, and Shen Xuanqing didn't even bother to look at her.As for Lu Gu, he hadn't been beaten in the Shen family for the past two days and even had enough to eat. It was a surprise to see that Du Hehua actually didn't scold him.\u2014\u2014After returning, only Wei Lanxiang was at home, Shen Yaoqing sent his wife back to her parents' house, and Shen Yan put the ducks in the pond behind the house.Seeing that Wei Lanxiang was peeling the beans, Lu Gu hurriedly came over to help. He squatted down in a hurry to work. It was Shen Xuanqing who moved a small stool for him to sit down.When he was at Lu's house, no one would get him a stool, and it made Lu Gu became more and more respectful towards Shen Xuanqing.He understood that the Shen family treated him well today because they were good people, not as dark-hearted as Du Hehua. The days of being beaten and scolded and didn't have enough to eat had passed.Wei Lanxiang saw that his hands were quick and easy, and he didn't seem to be lazy or slippery at all, so she felt more at ease.She saw that Lu Gu's face was much better today than yesterday, and when she saw Shen Xuanqing taking out the medicine bag from the kitchen, she said, \"You go to the backyard first to collect the eggs, and come here to fry the medicine, and the rest you don't have to do it.\"Lu Gu quickly got up and went to under the eaves of the kitchen to get the bamboo basket, which he saw yesterday when Shen Yan used this to collect eggs.To go to the backyard of the Shen family, you had to enter the road between the mud wall in the east, and it was about half zhang wide, enough for two people to run side by side.Originally, you could go to the backyard by passing through the main room, but most of the houses built in recent years sealed the back of the main room with a mud wall, separating it from the backyard, and the same was true for the Shen family.This was originally a layout only found in villages near Fenggu Town, and slowly spread to the surrounding area.Farmers with a better life like to raise some livestock, and they could sell them to earn more money if they were reluctant to eat them. However, raising livestock meant that there would be smell of feces, and in summer, flies would fly around it.By separating the backyard where the animals were raised from the main room, there would naturally be fewer flies fly in, and the smell of the house would be better and cleaner.The noble people in the town all paid attention to eat clean, and the dirty and dark insects in the food could easily cause people to get sick. Those high-ranking officials had said that now was a peaceful and prosperous year, and these gradually spread, even the people in the village were all willing to be particular about about it, and it would be a good thing to talk with the people in the town.Lu Gu smelled the smell of burning medicine, and he saw grass and ash scattered all over the narrow road on the ground, and some unburned hay stems. He knew that this was used to smoke and the smell could drive away the flies and stop them from buzzing and annoying people here.The three walls in the backyard were all mud walls, not fence walls. It could be seen that the Shen family took great care when building the house.Chickens and ducks were raised separately, and the Shen family's backyard was quite large. The chicken pen was surrounded by a bamboo fence, and a dozen chickens were digging and pecking everywhere.As soon as Lu Gu arrived in the backyard, he saw the three dogs on a leash, and Da Hui was alert for a moment, but after seeing him, it came back lay on it's stomach. Only the two small dogs barked a few times. Fortunately, the chicken pen was far away from the kennel, or he wouldn't dare to go in.There were chicken coops with hay mats and bamboo chicken coops on both sides of the chicken pen, and Lu Gu looked around for eggs.he didn't know how the hen lay eggs, but he tried to look for one under the chicken coop.If you wanted to touch the eggs laid by others, of course, you had to take advantage when the hens not paying attention. Lu Gu quickly picked the eggs up. The hens flapping their wings but didn't peck at his hand, and walked away with a cluck.Suddenly, Da Hui stood up, barked in the direction of Lugu.At the same time, Lu Gu's back was cold, and when he turned his head, he saw that the thin black dog that was supposed to be on a leash had gotten off the rope. The fangs were frighteningPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Lu Gu could almost feel a gust of wind coming towards him.Where he had seen such a vicious dog, even chickens were frightened by the dog, and one of the stupid ones bumped into his leg, making Lu Gu, who was already felt soft became softer. Suddenly after shaking a few times, his whole body trembled unconsciously, and he didn't even notice that the egg fell on the ground.The Da Hui kept barking, but it was more like in vain to stop the dog.At the critical moment, an angry shout suddenly sounded, it was Shen Xuanqing who appeared at the narrow passage. With this sound , the dog in front of Lu Gu stopped the offensive.The thin dog turned its head and saw that Shen Xuanqing took the shovel against the wall, and was about to hit it aggressively. Its demeanor and posture changed immediately, a few pitiful and weak whines came from its throat, and he shrank to the corner of the wall with its tail tucked.Seeing it flinched and didn't dare to attack, Shen Xuanqing didn't hit him, and stood in front of Lu Gu, frowned while trying to see if he was bitten.Da Hui, who had been barking for a while, stopped. It was so loud just now that Wei Lanxiang in the front yard also heard it. She was wondering in her heart. Just as she was about to shout and asked what was wrong, a fulang about her age came in at the gate. He brought a deflated little oil-paper bag and a bundle of wild vegetables.Lu Gu regained his senses, remembered the egg, and never thought that he had nothing in his hands, so he immediately panicked, and when he lowered his head, he saw the egg was smashed to the ground.He didn't cry when he was almost bitten, but seeing the broken egg made Lu Gu burst into tears.He actually didn't cry very often. This time he dropped the tears because he was simply frightened. He flinched and looked up at Shen Xuanqing. Tears welled up in the blink of an eye, suppressing the sobbing in his mouth.How could Shen Xuanqing didn't know his fear, if Shen Yan cried, he still had a way to deal with it, he would just get something delicious and fun, and she would stop, but Lu Gu, he still didn't know how to prescribe the right medicine.The egg yolk and the white part were all scattered, and he couldn't pick it up. There was no remedy. Shen Xuanqing shoveled soil from the side and covered the broken egg. He also smashed the eggshell. Once the loess covered it, it was impossible to tell where the egg was.Lu Gu's tears were still flowing, and he was stunned when he saw this. He looked at Shen Xuanqing's face with tears in his eyes.\"It's broken, if you don't tell her , I don't tell her, my mother doesn't know, just pretend it's not there.\" After seeing Lu Gu's tears stopped, Shen Xuanqing looked at the corner of the wall again.The black dog was stupid and not sensible, it was not as good as Da Hui, not even the two thin dogs, and because it hunted and bite too much, it was violent, sometimes the temper could only be stopped by him, but in the past few years, it had been trained to hunt with him. There were many benefits.Unexpectedly, the first time Lu Gu came to work in the backyard, its rope loosened.Now that he just got married, he threw out a lot of money. In the past two days, he had to work hard and went into the mountains. Now it was not worth it to slaughter and raised another one, so he would rest his mind for the time being.Besides, the black dog didn't bite Lu Gu. If it bite, it would be killed regardless of whether it was worth it or not. They had a rule here. The dogs which had seen human blood couldn't stay. They would become addicted.Shen Xuanqing avoided him and pulled the black dog out of the chicken pen, and whipped the black dog a few times with the rope.Lu Gu wiped his tears, cheered up and continued to look for eggs, didn't dare to slack off .He turned over the chicken pens and found four in total. If one hadn't been broken, there would had been five. Lu Gu walked out with the basket and was about to close the door of the chicken pen. Shen Xuanqing stopped him .\"I'll close it after I clean it up, you go back to decoction first.\" Shen Xuanqing brought the broom over. He originally came to the backyard to sweep the duck and chicken pens. It was hot in summer, so he had to clean up every two or three days. That was why, Lu Gu was not bitten by the dog.in the front yard.Wei Lanxiang was chatting with Zhou Xiangjun, and sighed about the bad news. When Lu Gu came out, she took the basket and took a look. There were only four, and the hens were not laying eggs well. A few were still okay.\"This is your third uncle's wife. In the future, let Erqing take you there to recognize the door. He also has a young couple, so you can be together even if there is nothing.\" Wei Lanxiang said as she walked towards the kitchen , after putting the eggs, he took a piece of meat and two fish from the urn where the cured bacon was placed.\"Aunt.\" Lu Gu in the courtyard whispered.Zhou Xiangjun smiled, pursed his lips and looked a little shy.\"Xiangjun, take this back and cook it for the third child and Yu Ge'er.\" Wei Lanxiang handed over the meat and fish. Although the fish was not a rare thing, these two had been killed and marinated. Ready-made, you didn't have to much trouble to process it when you went back.Zhou Xiangjun smiled embarrassedly, but didn't refuse, and said, \"Second sister-in-law bothered.\"There was work to be done at home, and Wei Lanxiang didn't let him stay anymore, and said, \"It's getting late, go back and do it quickly, Just in time for lunch.\"Zhou Xiangjun's husband, Shen Shunwang, was the third uncle of the Shen brothers, and even if he didn't come today, Wei Lanxiang would ask Ji Qiuyue to send some to save the heat.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Lu Gu sat in front of the small medicine stove and fanned the fire with a palm fan. Not long after, Shen Xuanqing came over.Wei Lanxiang was busy cutting the meat and vegetables in the kitchen, preparing for lunch.Lu Gu lowered his head and didn't dare to look around, but Shen Xuanqing walked straight towards him and stood still beside him.Neither of them spoke. Shen Xuanqing paused for a while before taking a thin piece of wood from under the eaves and stuffing it into the medicine stove.The fire in the stove was just right. Lu Gu didn't understand why he added another one, but he didn't bother to ask. Still Shen Xuanqing opened his mouth and explained, \"I ignite the fire and use it in the backyard.\"Hearing this, Lu Gu didn't dare to refuse. He responded, but he could only nod his head, unable to say anything else.After the firewood was ignited for a short while, the two stopped talking again, Shen Xuanqing lowered his eyes, and his eyes couldn't help falling on the little fulang who was sitting in front of the medicine stove.The sun was just right, and Lu Gu's complexion was much better than before. Perhaps because of the fire, his cheeks were slightly red.There was a narrow red mark between the eyebrows of shuang'er. It was often said that the brighter the better, it meant that the body was healthy and able to grow. The linen cloth wrapped around Lu Gu's head blocked his red marks , but Shen Xuanqing had seen it before he was injured.He was too thin, and the red mark was not as bright as Lu Wen's, but it was not too dim.Shen Xuanqing couldn't see anything on his face, but his eyes were fixed on Lu Gu's face. Speaking of which, he just calmed down and looked at his fulang's appearance carefully. His eyebrows, eyes and facial features were not much different, and he was even handsome. Only, the person was too cowardly and shy, thin and timid, always bowing his head in silence, and walking lightly, it was easy to ignore his existence.Lu Gu became more and more uncomfortable, and the knuckles of his fingers holding the handle of the palm fan turned white, which made Shen Xuanqing realized his rudeness.He lowered his head and paused for a while, Lu Gu was not so nervous anymore. When Shen Xuanqing looked at him, he couldn't even walk away. Now that he had been bought, Shen Xuanqing wouldn't be rude when he looked at him for a long time. Before long, he smelled a burning herbal smell, coming from the backyard.After covering the chicken and duck manure pile with soil in the backyard, Shen Xuanqing threw a bundle of green medicinal leaves on top, which could repel flies and insects and also washed away the smell of livestock in the backyard. Kept it for a few days.\u2014\u2014Only the four of them had lunch in the afternoon. Shen Yaoqing and Ji Qiuyue were still at their parents' house and wouldn't come back until evening.Wei Lanxiang mixed brown sugar with boiled water, and divided it into two bowls for Lu Gu to serve it on the table. She and Shen Yan, each drank half a bowl, and another bowl was for Lu Gu and Shen Xuanqing. After sat down, she said to Shen Xuanqing, \"This is your third aunt who brought it, you two should try it too.\"Sugar was more expensive than eggs, although it was only a small package, it was also Zhou Xiangjun's heart.After the wedding feast was over, the Shen family didn't have to work on the stove or stay to wash the dishes, so he and Shen Shunwang went back early, and went to the field to repair the ridges, missed the matter of going to the Lu family.Seeing that Wei Lanxiang didn't go out all day yesterday, he saw Shen Yaoqing when he went to the ground, and asked so that he knew that the second sister-in-law was not well. She lay in the house for a day.Lu Gu grew up so old, and he drank sugar water several times when his mother was still there. After smelling the sweetness, he remembered the taste, but he didn't dare to drink it casually, and pushed it to Shen Xuanqing next to him.Seeing that he was very cautious, Shen Xuanqing took a sip from the bowl, put it in front of Lu Gu, and said, \"I won't drink anymore, you can finish the rest.\"Lu Gu was not too familiar with such a good thing as sugar water, Wei Lanxiang naturally preferred her son, but because Shen Xuanqing had tasted it himself and it had nothing to do with Lu Gu, she couldn't say more, and besides Lu Gu was injured, so it would be better to drink a few more sips of sugar water. She was not too reluctant to give up.After the meal, Shen Xuanqing carried the hoe and prepared to go down to the ground. Before leaving, she said to Wei Lanxiang, \"Mother, I will go to the mountain tomorrow and come back the day after tomorrow.\"Wei Lanxiang said, \"Well, I will bake some cakes for you to bring.\"After she finished speaking, she glanced at Lu Gu, who was washing the dishes in the kitchen. She originally married a fulang and wanted him to follow Shen Xuanqing into the mountains, but the wound on Lu Gu's head was not healed yet. There was no way to follow.The sugar water made Lu Gu sweet from the body to the heart, even his eyebrows and eyes became lively, and his eyes became more radiant. He was in the kitchen himself, and no one saw such a fresh and happy look on his face that had been shrinking and depressed for many years, albeit only for a moment.\u2014\u2014Before the chicken croaked, the sky was gray outside, and Lu Gu woke up when he noticed Shen Xuanqing's movement. He knew that Shen Xuanqing was going into the mountain this morning, but he didn't expect it to be so early.Shen Xuanqing put on his coat by the dim light from the half-opened window, and said, \"You don't need to get up, I'll get dressed and go.\"Lu Gu had already sat up, he didn't know what he was going to do, but he still timidly whispered, \"I'll take you out.\"Now that Shen Xuanqing was going into the mountain, if he lay down and only knew how to sleep, it may make the Shen family dissatisfied, so even if he was very afraid of Shen Xuanqing, in order to live in the Shen family and not be rejected, he still mustered up the courage to say this sentence.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When he led the dog from the backyard, Lu Gu had already taken the cloth bag prepared by Wei Lanxiang from the kitchen, which contained the cakes baked yesterday.\"Er Qing, take the cake with you.\" Wei Lanxiang was lying on the bed and heard the movement outside, shouting through the window.\"I know, mother.\" Shen Xuanqing answered. After carrying the hatchet and hemp rope, he took the cloth bag and walked to the door with Lu Gu, said, \"I'll go out, you close the courtyard door and go back to your room.\"Before, it was Shen Yaoqing who came to close the door, but today was different, it would be Lu Gu.The village was too quiet, so everyone in the room could hear them talking. Wei Lanxiang heard Lu Gu sending her son to the door, and became more and more satisfied with the new fulang. This was how the couple should be. Seeing that Shen Yaoqing didn't need to go out and closed the courtyard door by himself, he turned over and went back to sleep.The wooden door creaked, and Lu Gu stood at the door. Under the gray sky, the tall and strong man led the three dogs and turned around. Seeing that Lu Gu was stunned, he said, \"Okay, come in quickly.\"Only then did Lu Gu close the courtyard door according to his words, maybe he got up too early, Shen Xuanqing's low and steady voice made him felt strange, but he was not afraid, just like when he broke an egg, Shen Xuanqing helped him without telling anyone.The man he feared the most was a good man.Lu Gu realized this again. He could vaguely hear the cooing of chickens in the backyard. The rooster hadn't crowing yet. It was still early before dawn. He went back to the room and lay down.\u2014\u2014A wisp of smoke curled up. Lu Gu boiled water in the kitchen. Today, there was no need to steam hot cakes. He sat on the small stool in front of the stove and ate the cake while adding firewood.The Shen family needed to drink a bowl of hot water when they wake up in the morning. The doctors here often said that drinking raw water was harmful to the body, so even if the water would become cold after a while, it was boiled water after all, so it was not harmful to the body. Now it was summer, it was more enjoyable to drink after cooling down.The water also boiled after half of the thick cake was eaten. He pushed the wooden pot lid to the corner of the stove with a long spoon. Otherwise, the white steam that came out would burn his hands and arms if he was not careful.Ji Qiuyue swept the yard and came in. Seeing that there were several bowls of hot water on the chopping board, Lu Gu was still scooping the last bowl. Whoever wanted to drink water could just take a bowl and drank it.She sat down and asked Lu Gu, \"Will we cook the loach?\"At Lu's house, Lu Gu didn't dare to touch the food. Du Hehua looked at him closely and even when he went to buy tofu, if you took it back, she had to beat and scolded him if it was slightly broken. It was obvious that the tofu residue was still in the basket. Du Hehua also said that he had no skin and face and dared to steal it.When killing fish and chickens, Lu Gu was sent far away, and he couldn't come back until the Lu family had finished eating.When he was hungry, he went to find something to eat. He found something to eat. He also ate loach, but because he had no knife or pot, he had to spend half a day wiping the fire with flint, and then pierced the loach with a branch. The whole loach was roasted on the fire, and it was not cooked properly at all.But when he came to Shen's house, he couldn't say that he didn't know anything. This was not free food. Lu Gu hesitated, looked at Ji Qiuyue and whispered, \"I'll try it.\"Ji Qiuyue knew at a glance that he wouldn't. Without forcing it, she said, \"I'll teach you. Loach is easy to kill without scales. It's enough to dig out the belly and clean the contents.\"She Yan came to join in the fun, and Ji Qiuyue caught her and said, \"Wait, you go to dig ginger.\"Lu Gu was not stupid, he was even smart, especially when he was doing something, he looked at it once, grabbed a loach from the basin, took the knife in Ji Qiuyue's hand, and learned a lot. He was obviously proficient.\"After boil the medicine, take this pot and put the loach to simmer it.\" Ji Qiuyue took out a black pot and said, \"You can just sit outside and watch the fire, you don't have to do anything else.\"Lu Gu quickly nodded. He ate meat every day for the past few days, and slept well at night. He looked better than before.The small fishes were too small. After raising it for two days, it spit out the sand. They didn't even need to open the belly. It was enough to scrape off the fine scales on its body.Shen Yan dug out a piece of ginger from the vegetable field, so that they could get rid of the coldness of the loach. The farmers planted onion, ginger and garlic by themselves, so that they wouldn't have to spend money to buy them.She went to the kitchen to cut a few slices of ginger, and when she came out, she grabbed a piece of burning wood from under the stove for Lu Gu to light the stove.Lu Gu took the firewood, and at some point a spark fell on his shoe, and he hurriedly brushed it away with his free left hand.Seeing that his feet were still the red embroidered shoes when he got married, Shen Yan asked, \"Brother Lu Gu, why are you still wearing this?.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It stands to reason that this pair of wedding shoes should be worn for visiting relatives during the Chinese New Year, so as to show the identity of the bride and groom.It was not that Lu Gu didn't know this rule, but he had no other shoes, so he couldn't go barefoot.After she finished speaking, she also remembered that there were only two summer clothes in the box that Lu Gu brought for his dowry, and there was no pair of shoes, so he couldn't change them at all, so she said annoyed: \"Look at me, I forgot this, wait, I 'll ask my mother.\"Hearing this, Lu Gu was startled and wanted to stop her from asking, how dare he asked the Shen family for something.Shen Yan's voice was not loud, but Wei Lanxiang was sitting under the eaves of the hall doing needlework, and she also looked at Lu Gu's feet. She heard Shen Yan talking about the dowry box, and she complained to Du Hehua in her heart.It seemed to outsiders that they were not worried about eating and drinking recently, and they also had meat every day. Obviously, they were not poor. As a result, the newlyweds didn't even have a pair of shoes to change. It would make people laughed when it came out. She was in the charge of the family's money. She knew how many and it was enough to pay for a shoes.The wound on Lu Gu's head hadn't yet healed. Whether changing the medicine or taking the medicine every day was money, although Shen Xuanqing paid for it with his private money, most of the money his son got from selling the prey was handed over to her . How many that left?Now that she had recognized Lu Gu, Wei Lanxiang didn't want to complain anymore. Although she had never studied, she also knew that a person must have a conscience, and she couldn't drive Lu Gu out just to save money. Thinking about how to live well was the serious reason.Before Shen Yan could speak, Wei Lanxiang said, \"I see, you are busy with your work.\"Lu Gu was uneasy, Wei Lanxiang shook her head and sighed when she saw him like this. He was too timid, so she had to comfort him: \" Don't worry, you still have your old clothes, it's just right to cut them to make shoes' uppers part\"Knowing that she was talking about the tattered clothes that Du Hehua gave, Lu Gu didn't want to throw it away, so he chose to wash it. Just in case you didn't have any clothes to wear, you could wear it.\"Mother, I cleaned that one.\" He whispered.Wei Lanxiang nodded and said, \"It's just right, you bring it.\"Even if he was reluctant, Lu Gu went into the room and took it out, Wei Lanxiang asked him again: \"How big is your feet, I don't know if there are any shoes like yours at home .\"After hearing what Lu Gu said, she took out Ji Qiuyue's shoes and asked Lu Gu to compare them on his feet, and said, \"you have the same size as your sister-in-law, save trouble and don't need to cut.\"She looked at Lu Gu's body and thought about Du Hehua's black heart, but the clothes for Lu Gu were good, so she said, \"Your black hearted stepmother dressed you well.\"After listening to her, he thought about it and said truthfully: \" This is what Lu Wen doesn't want.\"It turned out what Lu Wen wore before , and Wei Lanxiang immediately knew why. Before Shen Xuanqing got married, no matter who asked about Du Hehua, they said she was a good person, and even Lu Gu looked clean. Several clothes that Lu Wen didn't want supported the scene, and now others had already seen that Du Hehua was not good to Lu Gu.She turned over the ragged clothes and said to Lu Gu, \"I can make two pairs of shoes for you, and the rest can be used by Shen Yan. She has grown a lot recently, and her feet have grown too. These days, she always said that her shoes grind her feet.\"He could get two pairs of new shoes, which were not worn by Lu Wen. Lu Gu said that he was happy, but because of his long-established temperament, he didn't dare to show his joy at all, so he whispered, \"Listen to mother.\"Wei Lanxiang saw that he was so obedient, and even called mother, and she couldn't help but gave two more points of love in her eyes.Lu Gu went to boil the medicine and fan the fire. She thought as she did needlework, the material for upper shoes was enough, but some time ago, because of getting married, she used a lot of coarse cloth to make new shoes and jackets for her family. Now the remaining fabric was simply not enough for the soles of four pairs of shoes, so she had to think of a way.\u2014\u2014Lu Gu drank a whole bowl of loach soup at noon, and Wei Lanxiang specially gave him a lot of it. She said that it would be quicker to make up for his body. This thing didn't need to be bought, only dug it up by the river. It was not something new, and the Shen family didn't care who drank more or less.But for Lu Gu, it was very cherished. The white soup was delicious and fragrant only with salt. The loach and small fish were stewed, and even the thorns were soft, which was much better than the one he roasted with fire.After washing the dishes, Lu Gu originally wanted to help Shen Yan chopped the grass for the chickens, but Wei Lanxiang put a large basket on his arm and told him to go out, so he followed up.They could meet people along the road when they walked outside the village. Wei Lanxiang joked with the villagers, and even made Lu Gu recognize a lot of people. Let Lu Gu write down that this was his third uncle's house. If he wanted to come, he would know the door.Although Lu Gu's voice was small, he was not ambiguous when he shouted timidly along the way, and he kept all the words Wei Lanxiang said in his heart.He followed Wei Lanxiang all the way to the east without stopping, and suddenly realized that he was going to the town. Fenggu Town was about ten miles away from Qingxi Village, passing through four or five villages.A young man with fast footstep may take two to three quarters of an hour, and the peasant family didn't go out like a big family with a horse-drawn carriage. If you didn't hurry, you could take a rest on the way.Lu Gu didn't know what Wei Lanxiang was doing until she reached the town. She took out the wedding dress that Lu Gu had worn from the cloth-covered basket. She couldn't use it anymore, so she might as well sell it for some money.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Ji Qiuyue saw it and took it with her when she left.The fabric for the wedding dress was bought by the Shen family, and it wasn't originally made for Lu Gu. Lu Gu had no idea about the price of the clothes. He just wondered why Wei Lanxiang brought him.Wei Lanxiang took him to talk to the pedestrians on the commercial street to find customers. Fenggu Town was still lively, and there were more opportunities when there were more people. However, there would be a happy event in someone's home, asked for price, but Wei Lanxiang felt that she gave too little. Even if the dress not new, it was only worn for one day, so how could they sold it at such a low price.\"I said that my sister also knows the goods. Whoever sees this fabric can say it's good. It costs five hundred wen just for the dress. In addition to the embroidery work, you look at the stitches, how much thought it took, let alone you only give two hundred , if you really want it, three hundred.\"After hearing the three hundred, the bargaining woman pouted, but the material was really good, and the price was cheaper than made it herself. Pressing it again, she picked the dress: \"This dress is too big, it will take a lot of work to change it when I go back, and it will take a lot of effort to find similar materials to make the shoes.\"She said, and suddenly caught a glimpse of the wedding shoes on Lu Gu's feet, and looked at the pair of linen cloth wrapped around his head. There was a faint blood on the forehead. It looked like he had hurt his head. She seemed startled, and said: \"This is what you wore? The dress has blood, didn't he get hurt, unlucky because of wearing this wedding dress?.\"Hearing this, Wei Lanxiang immediately became unhappy, pulled back the wedding dress from the woman's hand, and said, \"What is auspicious and unlucky, sister, you want to buy it, just buy it, if you don't buy it, forget it, what do you say when you're like this.\u201dShe turned to Lu Gu and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go, don\u2019t sell it, go somewhere else.\u201dLu Gu hurriedly followed, feeling uneasy in his heart, very afraid because of him they couldn't sell the dress.The woman behind her was a little anxious. She just used the injured shuang'er to attack, so as to reduce the price. If she could win it with two hundred yuan, who would care if it was unlucky or not. She shouted twice from the back, and said to discuss it again.Wei Lanxiang just pretended that she didn't hear it. Good words made that person's words sounded too ugly. It was better to find another buyer.The two turned to another street, which was closer to Fangshi. Wei Lanxiang said to Lu Gu, \"I'm going to sell this. You wait here, don't go anywhere.\"It took a lot of thought, and people could no longer squeeze her to suppress the price.Lu Gu stood where he was and didn't follow. There were people coming and going around, and he was a little helpless in the middle of it.They walked along the street while selling the dress, seeing Wei Lanxiang walking forward, he hastily followed behind, not too close, only in the range where Wei Lanxiang could be seen.As soon as Wei Lanxiang looked back and saw him, her heart was at ease, so she no longer worried about Lu Gu.After walking around the town for an hour and a half, and finally sold the clothes for 300 pennies, Wei Lanxiang carried the cloth-covered basket tightly and took Lu Gu to the cloth shop.Wedding dress was not as easy to sell as ordinary clothes, and you had to be lucky to meet someone with a happy event. Besides, the rich and wealthy households didn't like this style of fabric. Only farmers and ordinary people in Fenggu Town would come up to take a look. If it was too expensive, people might as well buy the cloth and went back and made it themselves, so they could only sell it cheap.It was not bad to sell it for 300 pennies, at least she didn't need to touch the ones she saved.In the cloth shop, Wei Lanxiang spent 80 yuan to buy a piece of rough indigo fabric. The fabric was not as good as the wedding dress, but it was dyed brightly and looked much better and not cheap.When she bought the cloth, she compared it to Lu Gu, but Lu Gu stood still and didn't dare to move, so he let her compare.After leaving the shop, Wei Lanxiang said to Lu Gu as she walked, \"This fabric will be used to make new clothes for you. Can you do the work?\"80 pennies were an incomparably high price for Lu Gu. When he was eleven his mother died, and he hadn't learned how to sew clothes. After Du Hehua came, he had no chance. Unlike loach, he didn't dare to waste such expensive fabric, so he honestly shook his head.Making clothes was a big job. Shuang'er, who was seventeen or eighteen years old, hadn't seen much of the world, and the poor family didn't have much fabric to waste. Lu Gu was not the only one who was unfamiliar with life. Seeing that he looked a little scared, Wei Lanxiang said \"It doesn't matter if you don't know. You can learn it slowly later. Your sister-in-law is very good at making waistcoats, but it's not very capable when you make a full body. Sometimes you need to spend more fabric.\"Lu Gu couldn't answer, he just listened carefully, noon was over early, and the two hurried back.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In addition to their own, they also picked up the ones that others didn't want. There were a lot of them, Wei Lanxiang heard that there were a lot of people who buy it and the price was three pennies, to make shoe soles, otherwise who would buy a bunch of rags.Ji Qiuyue was squatting in the yard to chop grass, and when she saw Lu Gu came back with a bunch of rags, she wondered, \"Where did this come from?\"Wei Lanxiang replied smoothly: \"There are no old clothes at home , and I bought it from Grandma Ajin. Make the soles of the shoes for Gu Zi and Shen Yan.\"The Shen family had made new clothes before Shen Xuanqing got married, so when Wei Lanxiang bought new fabric for Lu Gu and said to make clothes, Ji Qiuyue was not uncomfortable, she also knew that Lu Gu didn't even have another pair of shoes, so pitiful, he wouldn't say anything.However, she was a little surprised to see that her mother-in-law was suddenly so interested in Lu Gu.Lu Gu put the rags on the ground and picked them up with Wei Lanxiang. If there was dirty smell, he took them out and put them aside. After that, they washed them with water, otherwise it would be too wasteful.Shen Yan was putting the ducks in the pond, and he took the wooden basin to the back of the house to wash the tattered clothes, and he saw her as expected.\"Brother Lu Gu.\" Shen Yan had just hit a bale of grass, and was sitting on a white stone to rest. When she saw him coming, she shouted and asked what he was doing.Hearing that Lu Gu said that her mother wanted to make shoes for them, she was naturally happy.The busy and steady day passed quickly. After dinner in the evening, Lu Gu washed the dishes as usual, while Wei Lanxiang and Ji Qiuyue visited the village before it got dark.On the way, Ji Qiuyue couldn't hold back and asked, \"Mother, why did you think of making clothes for Lu Gu?\"Wei Lanxiang sighed lightly before telling her the reason.Du Hehua was not easy to get along with. After the fight in Anjia Village, Shen Xuanqing injured Lu Daxiang, and Du Hehua cried when she saw anyone, saying that their Shen family was not good person, and even more ugly words were planted on Shen Xuanqing's head.There had been some gossips in the surrounding villages, and even Zhou Xiangjun heard about it. When he came that day, he mentioned to her that gossip was always bad, even if they were not wrong, but people could talk behind their backs.Shen Xuanqing and Lu Gu were splashed with sewage outside by Du Hehua. Let's not mention other things. Shen Yan was going to get married in the future, so she couldn't be dragged down and couldn't find a good family.Now she not only wanted to make new clothes and new shoes for Lu Gu, but also took care of people. No matter who looked at it, they couldn't say that the Shen family was at fault, and even Shen Xuanqing's reputation could be restored.Ji Qiuyue suddenly realized that this was true.The mother-in-law and daughter-in-law went to visit like this. When Wei Lanxiang was talking about marrying Lu Gu, she sighed and revealed that the reason why Shen Xuanqing bought Lu Gu was to save people, otherwise Lu Gu would be ruined by his stepmother. How could he survive, even if he did, it would be as hard as Du Hehua's hand, and Lu Gu had to be tortured to death in the Lu family.The fulang of the Xia family, who was chatting with her, nodded and sighed repeatedly, saying that it was right, and patted Wei Lanxiang's hand to comfort her.This fulang of the Xia family was good-hearted and warm-hearted. When he encountered injustice, he always had to say it bitterly. Even if he talked a lot, he could say a word to anyone, and he couldn't hide it. Told him today so that half of Qingxi Village would know tomorrow.Lu Gu, who was cleaning up in the kitchen, didn't know anything, but even if he knew, he wouldn't mind. Shen Xuanqing bought him from the Lu family, and he could eat and slept well here. For him, it was really saved him.Wei Lanxiang was very selfish towards him, but that was different from Du Hehua. Du Hehua only dressed him neatly, but didn't even give him food. So telling outsiders about that, it could be called telling the truth, compared to those bad things that Du Hehua did, this was nothing.\u2014\u2014Lu Gu was lying on the bed at night. He was the only one who slept alone tonight. He felt a little more comfortable, but he didn't dare to move things.He remembered the indigo fabric and the shoes. He couldn't believe it like a dream. Du Hehua's words that he once scolded him for not knowing whether or not he deserved to wear new clothes could still be heard in his ears.But now, Du Hehua couldn't beat him anymore.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He saved a basket of eggs and a basket of duck eggs to sell.There was no need to mow chicken grass in the past few days. The family had chopped a lot of grass. Most of the grass that chickens like to eat near the pond had been pulled up by Shen Yan. If you wanted to find it, you had to go far away. Because he was afraid the ducks would be lost, he didn't dare to go too far.When the sun was not too hot, he walked back to the white stone and sat down.The sky was blue and the trees were green, the river was rushing, and the sun was shining on his face. He raised his head and narrowed his eyes unconsciously, enjoying the heat of the sun in such silence.In the past, he couldn't get enough to eat and didn't wear warm clothes, and there were always harsh scolding in his ears. Sitting quietly like this was rare for Lu Gu. For him, it even seemed like a rebirth. The past all seemed to become distant.During the day, he lowered his eyebrows and pleaded with his eyes, and he didn't even dare to raise his head. Now, he raised his head to look at the sky, the clouds, and the sun, which was new to him, and gradually lost his mind.Quack's duck calls brought him back to his thoughts, even if he was alone, he was still a little flustered, for fear of being seen and saying he was lazy.He rubbed his hot cheeks, got up and plucked a kind of grass with slender stalks nearby. You could use this grass to ignite the fire when it dried.Summer was almost over, and it was always right to store more hay while the sun was still bright recently.The grass was too much and too heavy, and the long grass was not strong enough. Although the way back was short, if it was scattered, it had to be re-bundled. It was very troublesome. Lu Gu ran back to get the hemp rope. After taking the hemp rope, he came back and saw that the ducks were foraging for food in the pond, and his heart felt at ease.Just before dinner at noon, he plucked grass and dug up wild vegetables. It could be eaten fresh or dried. This thing grew quickly and abundantly by the water, so he dug a lot and tied it with straw rope and bring it back.Ji Qiuyue saw him rushing back with the ducks, carrying a large bale of grass behind his back, and carrying wild vegetables in his hand, so she hurried over to catch it, seeing so many wild vegetables, she said, \"It's just right, I'll mix it with miscellaneous flour tomorrow, Steam a pot of steamed buns and eat it.\"In order to prevent the meat from spoiling, they had been eating meat every day, and today they still had the last bowl of chicken. Now that they could eat meat, they would feel tired after eating it continuously for five to six days, seven or eight days, so they couldn't help but wanted to eat vegetables.Ji Qiuyue said that she would steam it tomorrow, but the more she thought about it, the more greedy she became. She simply said, \"We'll wash it, and we'll eat it at night.\"Lu Gu wouldn't say anything to her , so he nodded in agreement. After he drove the ducks back to the backyard, he came back to spread the grass out to dry.It didn't take long for Wei Lanxiang and Shen Yan to come back, and the family washed their hands to eat.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She was still young, and when she felt tired, she didn't want to go out to drove the ducks to the pond. She carried a bamboo basket and pulled Lu Gu to go with her to the pond to mow water plants.The two of them worked very quickly. The bamboo basket was full in a short time, and the pressure was particularly firm. Shen Yan didn't move her back all of a sudden, and was dragged straight back by the weight. Fortunately, Lu Gu supported her from behind.\"Too many.\" Shen Yan said in her mouth, but she also showed a silly smile, her almond eyes curved, innocent and childish.She said that she had to put it down again, and saw Shen Yaoqing in the front of the house, carrying two empty wooden buckets in his hand, came to fetch water from the river.Before he got close, he realized that the basket behind Shen Yan was too heavy, and asked with a smile, \"Can't you carry it?\"\"Brother Daqing, come quickly.\" Since there were rescue soldiers, although she could still move her back after persevering, Shen Yan simply threw the job to Shen Yaoqing.\"You said that you two, you won't make it less if you can't carry it.\" After he finished speaking, he poked Shen Yan's forehead, then put the wooden buckets down, and carried the bamboo basket on his back to go back first.Shen Yan and Lu Gu carried the empty bucket, and walked to the river for a while before stopping. The wooden bucket was not too small. According to their strength, they had to hold their breath when it was full of water, and they could lift it up with both hands at the same time.The two of them each had a bucket, they both scooped the water and brought it to the shore. Shen Yan said to Lu Gu, \"Wait until Brother Daqing comes over and let him carry it back.\"They couldn't move such a bucket full of water, they could only bring half a bucket to carry back, and it was inevitable to make several more trips.Fortunately, fetching water in these villages was usually a man's job. Before even if Lu Daxiang was old and frail, Lu Daxiang would go there most of the time. Otherwise, the villagers would see him instructed his children to do heavy work such as fetching water. They must say bad things behind their back, Du Hehua didn't dare to make it so obvious at that time.Shen Yaoqing brought the buckets full of water several times until the water tank in the house was full.Ji Qiuyue washed the wild vegetables, Lu Gu boiled water in the stove, and when the water boiled, he poured the wild vegetables into it, blanched it, and then scooped it into cold water, so it wouldn't be so hot.After chopping the wild vegetables, she and Lu Gu squeezed the water out of the vegetable with their hands.\"I'm going to take the flour.\" Ji Qiuyue saw that there were not many vegetables left, so she cleaned up the chopped vegetables on her hands, took the bowl to the flour tank and dug four and a half bowls of miscellaneous flour.Lu Gu squeezed the last of the wild vegetables out of water and put it in a basin. Ji Qiuyue would do the mixing by herself.Even at the end of summer, the kitchen would be very hot as long as the fire was on, and both of their faces were sweating. Ji Qiuyue couldn't keep her hands free, so she raised her arm and wiped it.The kitchen chopping board was right in front of the window. Shen Yaoqing saw her so hot in the courtyard, so he brought a fan and stood outside the window to fan her.Lu Gu didn't dare to look at the two of them, so he walked out of the kitchen with his brows down. He didn't know what Shen Yaoqing said in a low voice. Ji Qiuyue raised his voice slightly, and scolded: \"Go!\"Seeing that there was no other work to do at the moment, He went back to the room to cool off. The window of the room was open, and he could hear Shen Yaoqing and Ji Qiuyue talking and laughing in the yard.He didn't listen to what the two of them were talking about, his eyebrows narrowed slightly, but he thought of Shen Xuanqing.Unlike Ji Qiuyue and Shen Yaoqing, he didn't dare to talk in front of Shen Xuanqing at all, and even looked at that tall and strong man and felt terrified. Besides, he was sold to the Shen family, and he originally a fulang who wasn't married seriously. The difference was that he didn't dare to think about joking with Shen Xuanqing. In this comparison, he felt that he was the best at the moment. He was not someone who could talk, so he shouldn't do things that he was not good at.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When Lu Gu closed the window before going to bed, he looked up at the night, and the moon would be full on the fifteenth tomorrow.He was a little uneasy at the moment, how should he say that he wanted to go back to the grave?Before he got married, Du Hehua locked him at home and didn't let him go out. He didn't have time to tell his mother that he was married. It was one thing to be sold, but it was another thing to tell his mother the truth.The heat of the day dissipated, and the night became cooler. Lu Gu was wrapped in a quilt. He opened his eyes to think about something, and drowsiness gradually came. In a daze, he suddenly heard a few dog barks, from far to near.He opened his eyes again and was sure that he wasn't dreaming. The dog barked at the front of the courtyard, and there was the sound of paws scratching the door.Before he got up, he heard Shen Yaoqing walking out.\"Second brother?\" Shen Yaoqing shouted while putting on his clothes.\"It's me, eldest brother.\" Shen Xuanqing replied, when he came down from the mountain, he let go of the dogs, so he fell behind and let the dog barked at the door.As soon as the courtyard door opened, two small dogs squeezed in, wagging their tails around Shen Yaoqing, and Da Hui followed very steadily.\"Er Qing, are you back at this time?\" Wei Lanxiang shouted through the window. She sounded a little worried. Usually, he came back during the day, and it was not easy to travel in the mountains at night.Shen Xuanqing put down the things on his shoulders and said, \"Mother, I'm fine, I catched a few rabbits , I came back at night, I'll sell it early in the morning.\"\"Okay, then you go back to the room and sleep earlier.\" Wei Lanxiang was relieved.Shen Yaoqing tied the dog to the backyard, washed his hands and returned to his room. Shen Xuanqing also quickly washed his face, washing away the exhaustion of the wind and dust along the way.He pushed open the door and saw that Lu Gu was about to put on his shoes, and suddenly realized that he was married, and there would be someone waiting for him when he came back.Lu Gu raised his head when he heard the movement, but he hesitated for a while, Shen Xuanqing entered the room so quickly.Because they were not familiar enough, the two were speechless for a while. Lu Gu didn't know how to deal with this situation. He seemed a little nervous.Shen Xuanqing closed the door and walked over.It was not the first time for them to be so constrained to sleep in the same bed, so Lu Gu hurriedly moved into the bed to make room.The moonlight was like water, flowing in through the gaps in the windows, making people only felt peaceful, and there was nothing else to say at night.\u2014\u2014Lu Gu followed Shen Xuanqing and he took Lu Gu because he was going to pass through Anjia Village when he came back from the town. Lu Gu needed to go to Langzhong's house to change the wound medicine on his head, and the medicine he took was gone.Shen Xuanqing carried a large bamboo basket on his back, it was full of stuff, and it was sinking when he saw it. In addition to the three fat rabbits, there was also a half-dead deer.He set up a trap in a place where wild boars often haunted in the deep mountains. Except for hunters and herb collectors, few people dared to go there. According to their rules, he deliberately cut a few marks with an axe on a tree near the trap to make marks, people who often entered the deep mountains could understand it and avoided that place.Who knew that the wild boar wasn't caught. He took the dogs over to take a look, it caught the deer which ran into the wild boar's territory by mistake. The trap was surrounded by fallen leaves, it was not easy to see the footprints. He had seen the grass and the leaves on the trees being eaten. He knew that the deer who stepped on the trap was not the deer that ate it, there must be an old deer, but only the unlucky little one fell into it, causing the older one to escape.This young deer was not so bad if it was bad luck. It fell and was not pierced by the sharpened wood at the bottom of the pit, but it broke its spine and couldn't stand up again. After a night, there was not much breath left.He came back last night just to sell this half-sized deer. As for the rabbits last night, he was just guarding against the walls and ears.The rich and wealthy owners of the town liked this fresh deer. This deer was still small, and the meat was naturally tenderer than the old deer. It was not dead yet, and the price could go up.Shen Xuanqing's footsteps were fast, and it was a little harder for Lu Gu to follow him on the road , but he also knew that wild things were best sold alive.It was Shen Xuanqing who was walking and looking back and saw that he was struggling to follow, so he slowed down.The two of them got up very early, and it was just dawn when they arrived at Fenggu Town.There were people everywhere, and all kinds of shouts were constantly heard. Shen Xuanqing's pace became slower when there were more people, and he even walked side by side with Lu Gu.There was a tall and strong man beside him, which made Lu Gu felt a little panic but also felt inexplicably stable, all the fear brought by the noisy crowd was blocked by Shen Xuanqing.\"It's here.\" Seeing that there was an empty space in front of him, Shen Xuanqing simply unloaded the bamboo basket, took a piece of coarse cloth and spread it on the ground, put the three rabbits and young deer on it, and arranged them according to the size in a row.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

People from the yamen would come to collect money. Now that the peace was flourishing, there were occasional evil things, they were needed here. The government office was still quite clear, and there were no evil officials and dignitaries who ran rampant to oppress the small people. If you gave three pennies, you could occupy a place in the morning set.After the person who received the money left, Shen Xuanqing put away the half-sized wooden plaque that had been handed over.If you had a wooden plaque, it would be easier, otherwise there would be too many people who sell things and it was hard to remember it. This wooden plaque was a pair with three numbers on it, one, seven and five written in vermilion lacquer. He only had one of them in his hand. When he left, he would return the wooden plaque and matched it with the other one in the yamen's hand, and then made a sign on the wooden plaque as the roster.Lu Gu was still breathing slightly, and his cheeks were warm. Seeing him like this, Shen Xuanqing moved a small stone from the corner to let him sit.This was a seller who had been around for a long time, squatting and standing, tired his legs, so he made something. No one wanted to carry such a stone back and forth. Whoever came to sell something, first picked it up and sat down, when he left, someone else would used it.\"Sit and rest for a while.\" Shen Xuanqing said to Lu Gu, after that he stood aside and shouted: \"Come and see, the rabbits and deer that were just beaten.\"Farmers were rarely ashamed to open their mouths when they sold things .You could only eat food if you had money, so most of them could sell with a loud voice, and Shen Xuanqing was no exception. His voice was not too loud or sharp, but this physique stood behind the prey, and everyone knew that he was a hunter. Still a young hunter with steady eyes and handsome looks.Although he was darker and thinner, his face was handsome, and his skin and bones were not bad. Standing here, such a tall and handsome man made people looked at him more.It was such a handsome face, but Lu Gu didn't dare to look at it, and he didn't even have this awareness. He only had a cold and vague impression of Shen Xuanqing.It was also the recent interactions that made him knew that Shen Xuanqing wouldn't hit people easily, so what he thought of as \"fierce and cold-hearted\" before, now only left out the \"fierce\".As he was shouting, a middle -aged man approached, he looked like he was in his forties, with a small beard on his chin, and his slender face was shrewd at first glance \"how about the deer? \"Seeing that he was dressed neatly and thinking that he was the manager of a wealthy family in the town, Shen Xuanqing half-squatted down and replied, \"I beat it, it's still hot, it just died, if you buy it back today , the meat will be the freshest.\"\"Isn't this deer hurt?\" The middle-aged man touched the deer a few times, it was still hot, thinking that the hunter didn't coax anyone.\"The wild boars chased a group deer but didn't catch it. One of them fell off the cliff and broke its spine. After running for nothing in the mountains these days, I went around and caught it.\" Shen Xuanqing said a lie without changing his face, and there was some regret in his tone.The wild boars were ferocious and hard to hunt. He set traps just by chance. If he could catch and killed them, he could sell them for money and it could be safer in the mountains. You couldn't tell people that the prey was picked up for nothing, otherwise the price would be pushed down.The deer skin was still intact without any injuries. The middle-aged man took a look of the deer's belly, stood up and asked, \"How much?\"Shen Xuanqing also stood up and replied, \"You can give me eight taels.\"The middle-aged man opened his eyes a bit rounder: \"You are also true, you dare to ask for this price. You want eight taels for this ?\"\"Eight taels are already cheap. A doe can be sell for thirty or forty taels. This deer at least four months, it's no less than 25 pounds.\" Shen Xuanqing calmly negotiated the price.The middle-aged man didn't show weakness, but asked: \"How much is the doe, and how much is this? You will need eight taels for these few pounds of meat. Five tasks, if you can, I will give you the money directly. I don't need to go back to get it.\"This was quite lavish to say, and to carry so much silver with him, the middle-aged man looked a little smug, and five taels of silver was indeed not a small amount.\"You are also knowledgeable. Although the doe is heavy, the meat is not as tender as the young deer. You and the master in your house should know this the most. The deer in the mountains are smart and good at running, and the doe with the cub is even not easy to come out, and it's usually impossible to hit a young deer, let alone taste it.\"\"People often say that the meat of a cub that has just turned one month is tender, and the ladies and gentlemen in the city love it. We don't know what it's like, but the young deer that is only four months old is definitely more tender, so how can the price match the old deer.\"Doing business was all about being gentle and making money. Shen Xuanqing spoke calmly and gently, his words were clear, neither humble nor arrogant. Seeing that the middle-aged man hesitated, he added: \"You asked if this deer is not injured, I think it's because of your through consideration. This deer skin is so complete that it's enough to make a pair of deerskin boots for the mansion, and it's also decent to go out.\"\"Well, you know what I think\", nodded with a calm expression on his face, as if he didn't care much about it, but he was thinking.\"The price is still too high, make it less.\" He said to Shen Xuanqing.\"Eight taels of silver are already cheap. If you hadn't come to ask, I would have sold them for ten taels. In this way, if you buy it, I will give you this rabbit as a snack.\" Shen Xuanqing grabbed the biggest and fattest one. The size was completely incomparable to the other two, which was enough to show his sincerity.The good result of bargaining was not to suppress the price, but to add something as a compliment. Besides, this rabbit was the gift for the middle-aged man, which made his face grew a lot of light, but he still pretended to think. In the end, he took out eight taels of silver and gave it to Shen Xuanqing, showing his wealth and prestige in front of others, and then he carried the deer and the rabbit and left.Of course, Shen Xuanqing didn't know that after he went back, he reported to the master of the mansion that he bought it back with 10 taels of silver.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 26": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Sweet Little FulangChapter 14 Part 1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayRich people didn\u2019t care if they ate fresh wild game at the price ten taels of silvers. The meaning was to show that it was rare. Besides, the young deer was delicious, juicy, tender and nourishing. With silver could be won.Shen Xuanqing thought about it on the way here, if the price was suppressed too hard, as long as it was not lower than five taels, at least it would be enough for half of the debt he owed.Even though the middle-aged man was greedy for money, he didn't dare to go too far. He was greedy for two taels of ten taels, but he didn't dare to report sixteen taels for eight taels. It was a big deal to get this errand.In the rice shop, Shen Xuanqing borrowed the scales to weigh the scattered silver from the middle-aged man. The rice shop was not far from the stall he and Lu Gu occupied, and Lu Gu was watching alone at the moment.He thanked the shopkeeper and was about to leave when the shopkeeper stopped him and asked how the rabbit was sold. Since he borrowed someone's scales, he said a cheap price. He got a lot of money today, and a little profit was nothing.Ever since Shen Xuanqing entered the rice shop, Lu Gu looked at there from time to time, and now he was relieved to see him came out.\"The shopkeeper needs to take a look, it's almost time to go back.\" Shen Xuanqing picked up the bamboo basket and the things on the ground as soon as he came over.Lu Gu obeyed his words and followed into the rice shop.In the end, these two small rabbits sold for fifty copper coins. On weekdays, it wouldn't be a problem for these two to sell for seventy or eighty copper coins. At least they were caught from the mountains, not common chickens and ducks.Seeing that he sold it so cheaply, the shopkeeper of the rice shop smiled a little more on his already friendly face, and said that if he got any other wild game in the future, he could visit him, and even if he didn't buy it, he could help and asked the shopkeepers of other shops. He would come over if he wanted to buy rice, it would be cheaper for him.Shen Xuanqing still knew how to talk in the scene, the two regarded each other as their customers, and it was not a disadvantage to be familiar with each other, and it was also an extra friendship, and he left with Lu Gu after a few words of hospitality.With a whole eight taels of silver in his bosom, Shen Xuanqing let out a long sigh of relief silently. Only then did he truly feel at ease, and a sense of joy welled up immediately. It was the first time for him until he grew up so big like this to have this kind of good luck, and even the rest of the family, no one had ever made so much money in one go.When he picked up a young deer in the mountains yesterday, he knew he had hit luck this time, but he hadn't gotten any money at that time.When the money was not in his hands, he seldom showed it. Not only was he tight-lipped, but he didn't even have a happy mood. This stemmed from an experience he had when he was eleven years old.For ordinary people, if they got something valuable and wanted to sell it, they would definitely be overjoyed. Even if they knew that the wealth shouldn't be revealed and they tightly covered the news, they would be excited in private, and Shen Xuanqing was also like this before.He was still young at the time, and his stature and physique were not as good as now. He learned the skills from the old hunter and had a little boxing and kicking skills for a year or so. The first time the rabbit was shot with a bow and arrow.At the age of eleven, it was the first time that the bow and arrow hit the prey. He was naturally excited, and ran to the master with the rabbit. The old hunter was not a serious old man, but a kind old man with red cheeks. Seeing him hit the prey he also said he was great.The hunter hunted something and wanted to sell it for money. After taking it back and showing it to his family, Shen Xuanqing decided to go to the town and sold the rabbit, counting it as the beginning of his career as a hunter.His family members said he could sell it for at least thirty copper coins, and he thought so, but when he arrived in the town, the rabbit buyer saw that he was just a kid, so he was only willing to pay twenty copper coins.He didn't want to sell it and wanted to leave, but the rogue man held the rabbit in his hand and insisted on buying and selling by force, and the two almost got into a fight. A few peddlers couldn't stand it anymore, and hurried forward to help, yelling that this was not bullying.The rogue was punished by everyone, and finally he was given five more copper coins.Shen Xuanqing thought that he could sell for thirty copper coins, but only got twenty-five copper coins, and went back with a sullen head and frowning. When the family asked, although he was relieved, they said that he was very promising if he could sell these things. Scoundrels were nothing but hooligans who only bully children and made them angry.Because he was being bullied, Wei Lanxiang specially steamed egg custard for him to reassure him, and secretly gave him ten copper coins to buy preserved fruit and snacks.Fenggu Town was big, and they didn't know that rogue, even if they wanted to call back to ask for an explanation or vented their anger, they had nowhere to look.Shen Xuanqing later let go of this matter, but the comparison of joy and loss that day was so \"tragedy\", so that he had a long memory since then. When he went out in the morning, he didn't tell his family how much the deer could sell.In fact, he and that rogue met once two years ago, near the tofu shop. He was just passing by at first, and recognized the man with the big mole on his face. When he saw the rogue defrauding seven years-old child, he shook his head secretly, it turned out that he was really a wimp who only picked on the weak and easy to bully.The child was playing by the river and caught two big fish. He tied them with a straw rope and took them to go home. The rogue stopped the child and said that he wanted to buy them. Hearing that he could exchange them for money, the child\u2019s eyes widened. He was willing, but the rogue only gave him three copper coins.This price couldn't attract a seven years-old child. The child curled his mouth and bypassed him. Seeing that he couldn't be deceived, the rogue immediately snatched them.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He thought that the debt of ten taels of silver would have to be saved until May next year, but now it would be almost here.As for Lu Gu, when he heard about eight taels of silver, he felt it was unbelievable. A small deer could be sold for so much money, and if it was exchanged for copper coins, the number of copper coins he got was beyond his counting.Unbelievable at the same time, he also knew that it was Shen Xuanqing's money, and he had nothing to do with it.But this didn't hinder the joy in his heart, it was his selfishness, he knew that the Shen family must be happy when they got so much money, and they wouldn't beat and scold him when they were happy.When they passed by the pastry shop, the shop had just opened, and the clerk was carrying a square wooden tray and putting all kinds of pastries on the cabinet one after another, and the sweet smell wafted out from inside.Lu Gu followed Shen Xuanqing to a stop.\"Pack six pieces of Baiyun Cake.\" Shen Xuanqing took out a handful of copper coins from his sleeve, counted twenty and handed them to the clerk, then took the oil paper bag from him.Baiyun Cake was expensive, it was ten copper coins for three pieces, it was as delicate as curd fat, and as white as clouds in the sky, it was sweet but not greasy after a bite, and then melted on the tip of the tongue in the mouth, giving people an endless aftertaste.This item was sold well in the town in the past two years. Those with a little money in the countryside would learn how to eat and wear like people in the town, which made other villagers envious. If someone had spare money to buy this and went back, it would be very face-saving.Lu Gu once saw Lu Wen ate this, a cup of tea and three pieces of Baiyun Cake, Lu Wen would cover his mouth with a handkerchief while eating, the gesture of raising his hand was indeed elegant and beautiful, and he ate it. He was guarded by Du Hehua, even if he took a single glance, he was sent to wash the clothes by the river.In fact, he was not greedy, because it was useless to be greedy, it would only make people uncomfortable, so it was better to think about other things.Shen Xuanqing turned around from the door of the pastry shop, glanced at his thin and quiet husband, passed the oil paper bag over, and said, \"I'll share it with my mother when I go back.\"Lu Gu was flattered, Even if he followed Shen Xuanqing out of the town, he still couldn't believe it, carefully holding the oil paper bag.It was very light, but it cost twenty copper coins, so he became more and more cautious.On the way back, Shen Xuanqing walked slowly, so Lu Gu didn't have to hurry. When the two arrived at Anjia Village, this time they were coming from the direction of the town, they could only enter from the front of the village, and the few houses they entered were Lu's.Now the sun had came out early, and those who should go to the field had already gone to the field. Most of the families in the house were women, children and the elderly.The door of Lu's courtyard was ajar, but no one was in the courtyard, and no movement could be heard inside. Lu Gu restrained himself after a glance, lowered his eyes and remained silent, no one knew what he was thinking.Shen Xuanqing noticed his expression, but seeing that he didn't linger and hesitate, he felt relieved. People like Du Hehua and Lu Daxiang were not worth dealing with. Would mess around, the more alienated the better.When the people in Anjia Village saw Lu Gu, they all knew that he had been sold to Qingxi Village. The people who were talking stopped abruptly, and just watched him Walked past with their eyes.Lu Gu had a timid personality, although he was not generous, but he was not awkward or weird either. When he was in the village,when he met any aunt or grandma he would call in a low voice. In the eyes of the villagers, he was not talkative and a little boring, but he was still well-behaved.Now being looked at like this, he hesitated even if he wanted to call out, and since he had already walked over, how could he open his mouth.In the end, Aunt Qin, who was always straightforward, asked him where he came from. It was no different from how he was treated in the past, so he opened his mouth and called someone, saying that he was from the town.Aunt Qin couldn't help taking a look at Shen Xuanqing. Because of Lu Gu, Shen Xuanqing called Auntie along with him. Aunt Qin was a little surprised, but she still answered with a smile. Then she heard people calling her at home, and she hurriedly said to the two of them: \"Auntie has something to do, so I won't talk.\"Such a homely conversation made Lu Gu relieved from the uneasiness just now.Wang Langzhong was drying the medicinal materials in the courtyard, and he was very satisfied to see him remembering the days, at least he was concerned about Lu Gu's injury.Country people had no money in their hands, and they hated the most was injuries and illness. It was okay to get over minor illness and misfortunes, but there were always people who procrastinated until they didn't heal for a long time, making him, a barefoot doctor, shook his head every time.After removing the linen cloth from Lu Gu's head, Wang Langzhong nodded and said, \"It's okay, the wound has healed, so you don't need to wrap it up, just take medicine for a few days.\"\" Don't get injured again.\" He told Lu Gu while mixing the medicinal materials.This time they took the medicine for five days. According to Wang Langzhong's instructions, they would come to check the pulse later. If there was no deficiency of Qi and blood in the inside, they didn't need to take the medicine.The wound medicine applied on Lu Gu's head was collected by Wang Langzhong himself from the mountain, it was not a precious medicinal material, and it cost only eight copper coins for two packs.And Lu Gu had to charge money for the medicines he took, because in the prescriptions, besides the medicinal materials he picked himself, there were also money for the medicinal materials collected from others.Every time farmers came to see a him, Wang Langzhong tried to use cheap medicine with good effect, which could be cheaper, but this time Lu Gu suffered a lot of blood from the injury on his forehead. He had to add an expensive one to the medicine, the medicine for one day cost 70 copper coins, and the medicine for the seven days last time was 490 copper coins.However, for these five days of medicine, he took away the expensive medicinal materials and replaced it with the other ones.People often said that seeing a doctor dragged down the family. When Lu Gu saw that Shen Xuanqing had spent so much money, he was so frightened that he was at a loss and dared not vent his anger.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Du Hehua found out, and beat and scolded him after he recovered from his illness.Du Hehua was also ruthless, he didn't hit him in the face, he just pinched his thighs and arms, pointed the stick at his back and stomach, he didn't dare to say anything, and he didn't dare to show his injuries to others, otherwise he would be the same. If someone looked at his thighs and arms, his innocence would be gone.Now that he spent more than 600 copper coins, Lu Gu tremblingly looked up at Shen Xuanqing's face.Shen Xuanqing didn't have so many copper coins, so he took out a few pieces of silver from his bosom.Seeing this, Wang Langzhong took the scales of the family, said that it was enough for 600 copper coins, so he paid in full.Lu Gu took the medicine handed over by Grandma Wang in his hand, seeing that Shen Xuanqing's expression didn't change after he paid the money, and his anxious eyes became a little more stable.He didn't hear that deep and steady voice until the two of them went out and walked from the trail towards Qingxi Village.\"As long as the injury was cured.\" Shen Xuanqing thought about it, and then said: \"The money was spent and then earned it back. If it drags on until it can't heal, it will really cost a lot of money.\"Although there was no relationship with Lu Gu, it was possible to live together in the end. Yes, Shen Xuanqing didn't want him to be so frightened and cowering, he didn't dare to breathe, and if he didn't even dare to say a word, then if they went into the mountain, it would be no different from him being in the mountain alone.Lu Gu was stunned for a moment, he thought that even if Shen Xuanqing didn't hit him, he would blame him, but what he heard were these kind words.\"I can work.\" He muttered, wanting to show his loyalty, but because his expression was too weak and timid, he didn't have any confidence at all.Shen Xuanqing saw his hard work in the Shen family these days, and replied in a low voice: \"Yes, I know.\"After getting the answer, Lu Gu made up his mind to work hard. It cost 80 copper coins for the cloth, and the medicine today was 600 copper coins. His mother taught him to count money when she was still alive, but because he hadn\u2019t touched anything related to money for a long time, he pondered for a long time in his heart. It was only then that he figured it out, it cost him 680 copper coins in total, and that was not including the food and drink at the Shen family.680 copper coins was an amount he had never seen before when his mother was around, the more he thought about it, the more surprised and flustered he felt at such a large amount of money.After walking out of Anjia Village, there was another village two miles ahead. There was a gentle slope to the left of the two of them. After going up the gentle slope and going down, you would arrive at the cemetery of Anjia Village, where Lu Gu 's mother's grave was located.His pace was obviously slow, and he glanced towards the cemetery . Today was fifteen, and he passed by here again, and he had to help with the work when he went back, so he may not be able to come out like this again.After spending so much money and going to the cemetery to delay the journey, Lu Gu was afraid of being told that things were troublesome, so he couldn't lift up his confidence, and even directly lost his temper.Shen Xuanqing, who was still walking by, noticed that his expression was getting weaker, so he frowned slightly and asked, \"What's wrong?\"As soon as Lu Gu looked up, he saw him frowning slightly, as if displeased, and couldn't even make up a lie for a while. When it came out, he stuttered in fright and said the truth: \"My mother, my mother's grave was there.\"Shen Xuanqing stopped and asked, \"Want to go there?\"Seeing that he had no sign of anger, Lu Gu carefully said: \"I want to go there. Go and have a look, it won't take much time, and I'll be back right away.\"Shen Xuanqing didn't make things difficult for him, Lu Gu was very grateful, but he was stupid and couldn't speak nice words, he glanced at Shen Xuanqing, hesitant to speak, and then hurried to the cemetery.When he walked down the gentle slope and couldn't see his figure anymore, Shen Xuanqing remembered that he didn't bring anything to the cemetery, but then he thought, what he said was to go and have a look, not to go to the grave.They had only been together for a few days, they were not even familiar with each other, and Shen Xuanqing couldn't say more intimate words, so he suppressed the matter.In front of the grave.Lu Gu knelt down and put a handful of small wild fruits on the ground, which he picked from the thorn bushes at the bottom of the slope in a hurry when he came over.Others burnt paper money when they went to the grave, but he didn't have a copper coin at other times except that Lu Daxiang would give him three copper coins to buy it during the Chinese New Year.Now at Shen's house, he was still penniless, he couldn't even get out a copper coin, and he couldn't buy paper money, so he put some wild fruits as sacrifices as before.\"Mother, I'm married.\" Lu Gu held back his tears and said in a low voice, saying that the person he married was good, and now he could eat and dress warmly, and that person even bought him a baiyun cake, which he carried in his hand.After finishing a few words, he didn't dare to delay any longer, kowtowed three times and left.Shen Xuanqing was still waiting for him by the side of the road. Lu Gu wiped off the dirt on his body when he was going uphill, and wiped away his tears. Apart from a little red eyes, there was no other abnormality.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Lu Gu washed the dishes and saw that there was nothing else to do at the moment, so he wanted to go back to his room for a rest, but when he went in, he saw half a piece of Baiyun Cake in the bowl on the table.He finished eating his own, and other people generally didn't enter this room, only Shen Xuanqing's.At this time, Shen Xuanqing was in Wei Lanxiang's room, talking about the eight taels of silver.Wei Lanxiang's eyes widened when she heard this. After receiving the seven taels of silver, she looked at the scattered silver and said to the Buddha: \"Amitabha, Amitabha, if you lose, you gain. This was true.\"She said and couldn't stop muttering: \"People often say don't do anything wrong, good luck will come, we will earn back the money we got scammed by the Lu family.\"\"I just said, treat Lu Gu better, you still have to do good deeds, don't be as dark-hearted as that Du Hehua.\" She was rambling, and hurriedly hid the broken silver.A few taels more would be enough to repay the debt. As soon as the debt was paid off, all the money they earned in the future would be their own.Shen Xuanqing came out when she was hiding the money. The ten taels of silver was borrowed for his married husband, and he was supposed to pay it back, so he gave the money to Wei Lanxiang and handed it over to the public.When he got married, they not only spent the ten taels of silver, but half of the other expenses were from his private money, and the other half was paid by Wei Lanxiang and Shen Yaoqing. Since Shen Yaoqing paid all the money, he couldn't ask his elder brother to help him paid off the debt. Well, now that he had earned eight taels of silver, he had nothing to hide and had made it clear to his family.He kept the remaining silvers for himself, because he often went to the town to sell prey, and he bought most of the oil, salt and other things that were lacking at home, so he had some money in his hand.When he returned to his room, he saw Lu Gu holding the clothes he had changed last night and was about to go out to wash. The two met at the door, and Lu Gu quickly moved to the side.Shen Xuanqing glanced at the baiyun cake on the table, lowered his voice and said, \"I tasted it, it's not good, you can eat it.\"Shen Xuanqing kept his voice low so that no one else could hear him.Except for his own mother, no one left him something good to eat. Lu Gu felt an indescribable emotion, but this inexplicable feeling quickly dissipated. In his eyes, Shen Xuanqing was tall and cold. It must be really not delicious, otherwise how would there be leftovers.\u2014\u2014Days passed quickly, Lu Gu Indigo's new clothes were ready, Wei Lanxiang followed him first, and made a new pair of shoes.Lu Gu, who worked with shoe soles, and Wei Lanxiang each had a shoe, and the two of them could do it quickly.The weather turned colder, the sun was no longer so hot, and he was free after dinner. He wore new shoes and new clothes, and was led by Wei Lanxiang to visit Aunt Gu's house in the east of the upper village.Shen's house was close to the mountain, in the innermost part, going to the entrance of the village was almost like walking around the village.\"Aunt Lanxiang, the clothes on the second family's body were really pretty.\"Grandma A Jin and the other mothers were chatting and working under the big tree at the entrance of the village, and they all praised Lu Gu who was wearing that indigo dress.\"He's handsome too.\"Lu Gu was very embarrassed by such a compliment, but Wei Lanxiang smiled from ear to ear, went to Gu's house after chatting with them a few words.Aunt Gu\u2019s son, Gu Sheng, was a street peddler who sold all kinds of groceries. When there was not enough needlework at home, Wei Lanxiang came to buy some.When they entered, they saw Aunt Gu drying dried fish in the yard, and there was a smell of fish in the yard. She smiled and asked, \"Sheng Zi's mother, do you have any cotton thread?\"Aunt Gu said quickly, wiped her hands with the apron tied around her waist, and went into the house to get it.Wei Lanxiang also bought some colored thread, saying that she would embroider a few flowers on the shoes that Lu Gu and Shen Yan made. They didn't wear gold and silver in the countryside like they did in the county town. A few flowers embroidered on their clothes were considered beautiful.It was true that she came to buy thread, and it was true that she brought Lu Gu to show off in front of people.When Aunt Gu saw the new clothes and shoes on Lu Gu, she naturally wanted to praise him, besides, Lu Gu's appearance was indeed not bad, and he was pretty and fair, which was made even whiter by the indigo cloth.Recently, Lu Gu ate well and slept well at Shen's house, he recovered a little complexion, even the red mark between his eyebrows was a little red, white and rosy, wasn't he a handsome man.Wei Lanxiang took him around the village before returning satisfied.When the two of them arrived at home, Lu Gu looked at the colorful embroidery thread in the sewing basket, his expression slightly concentrated, as if he was thinking about something, but a few dogs barking outside the door interrupted his thoughts.Shen Xuanqing, who had been in the mountain for five days, came back and caught a few hares and pheasants. This was not bad, they were common wild animals, but when he took out the cloth bag at the bottom of the bamboo basket, Lu Gu saw what was in the bag. The strip was moving, and he was startled, it looked like a snake no matter how it looked!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If he took the snake gall and sold the snake gall separately from the snake meat , it would need to soak a snake gall in the strong wine for freshness. Some were not worth it.Although he used to get snake meat to eat, but because he didn't like it, he didn't kill the snakes for the galls many times, only twice, none of them were poisonous snakes, and the galls were not that expensive, this time it would be different, in case the galls were broken with a lot of strength, it was ruined.Besides, the long snakes was slippery and cold to the touch, and he didn't like to touch it, and Wei Lanxiang was especially afraid of snakes. If he kept it at home, he might not dare to leave the house for a few days, so he might as well sold the whole thing.Shen Yaoqing was excited when he heard it, and said: \"Snake gall was a good thing, and it was very valuable.\"After he finished speaking, he asked Shen Xuanqing: \" it didn't bite you, right?\"The Five-step snake was a poisonous snake with strong poison. At most, the skill should be better, catching poisonous snakes was always dangerous, if one was accidentally bitten, even one's life would be lost.Hearing this, Shen Xuanqing stopped rubbing the wild bath beads, turned his head and saw his husband squatting down, thin and small, looking at him timidly.he hadn't seen him for five days, today Lu Gu was wearing indigo blue clothes, it seemed to be whiter than before, and it seemed to be more beautiful.From Lu Gu's tense expression, he realized that he had been looking for a long time, so he averted his eyes and said in a low voice, \"Scramble another egg. \"\"Okay.\" Lu Gu nodded hastily, and went into the kitchen.Ji Qiuyue came out from the backyard to feed the chickens, and saw Shen Xuanqing came back and called him, she was always busy in the kitchen, now she saw Lu Gu like this , she smiled and thought that the young couple finally got along a bit.Lu Gu was uncertain about how to scramble a few eggs for Shen Xuanqing, Ji Qiuyue came in while he was hesitating, and asked him to take four from the basket.\"Erqing loves eggs, fried or boiled. For him alone, four should be enough, and there were other dishes.\" Ji Qiuyue couldn't stay idle as soon as she came in, and habitually took them from Lu Gu. After chopping vegetables, she didn't even realize it.After the water in the pot was filled, Lu Gu put six steamed buns on the drawer. Hearing this, he wrote down Shen Xuanqing's preferences, and nodded in agreement: \"Well, it's enough.\"\"The vegetables were cut, and the eggs were also beaten. Okay, but the steamed buns haven't been heated yet, so we have to wait.\"Ji Qiuyue said: \"I heard people say that there was a youzhong ladle (\u6709\u79cd\u9a6c\u52fa), which was smaller than our iron pot, and has a long handle on the side, which can be placed on the medicine stove for cooking. If you can buy one, it will be much more useful, so you don't have to wait any longer. \"Lu Gu also heard people say that that kind of youzhong ladle Seemed to be called a frying spoon, and it was lighter than a cauldron. He thought Ji Qiuyue was right, so he nodded and chatted with her in a low voice: \"It seems quite Expensive.\"\"Of course, it's made of iron.\" Ji Qiuyue turned around and said, she thought for a while and then said, \"When we get better, I'll let your Brother Daqing, go to the iron shop in the town to have a look.\"Everyone Wanted to live a good life, and Lu Gu was also included in her expectation for a better life, causing hope to quietly appeared in Lu Gu's timid eyes, and he carefully Restrained himself and hid his emotions.The kitchen was busy, and the steamed buns would be slightly hot as soon as the water was boiled. It was not that you had to eat very hot food in winter, so the waiting was not too long.Knowing that the eggs were not fried by Lu Gu, but seeing him serving the dishes and steamed buns for himself, Shen Xuanqing felt differently from before.\"Do you want to eat?\" He asked Lu Gu.Lu Gu, who put down the steamed bun basket, shook his head and said , \"I've eaten it, you eat it.\"After a few days of unoiled rice in the mountains, Shen Xuanqing was satisfied with a bite of scrambled eggs when he came back. He knew how to stir-fry, But because of poor cooking skills, the pot would be burnt when the fire was too high. He felt that it was unpalatable. Sometimes he was busy and hungry and didn't care about frying. He just boiled the vegetables with water. When they were cooked, sprinkled some salt and mix them. up.In the past two years, his family was in a bad situation and had no money to buy oil. He often ate boiled dishes and occasionally boiled eggs. Now that life was better, he was greedy for eggs fried in oil.Lu Gu felt that it was not good to watch other people eating, so he went to Wei Lanxiang's room to do needlework. Shen Yan's shoes hadn't been made yet, so he had to help.\u2014\u2014When Shen Xuanqing came back, every time remembered the date, so that he could take Lu Gu to check his injuries.At the laozhong's house, Lu Gu hadn't finished his diagnosis. He noticed someone coming in at the door, Lu Wen.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Don't forget to rest and recuperate in the future. You are still young. You have been short-lived in the past few years. Fortunately, no serious trouble has been planted.\"And the words of Wang laozhong made Lu Wen's face changed slightly at the door, and thought that someone else words would fall on his mother's head, didn't Shen Xuanqing look over now?Lu Wen clearly saw that Shen Xuanqing only looked over after Wang Langzhong had finished speaking. The face of Shen Xuanqing, who had always been good-looking, seemed to be pricked by a needle point, but he never wanted to show embarrassment on his face , maintaining his elegance and composure.\"pregnancy shouldn't be a big problem. You two are still young, and it won't be too late to get a better baby. It's good for both adults and those in your stomach.\" Wang Langzhong said, looking at the red marks on Lu Gu's eyebrows, and turned Joyfully said to Shen Xuanqing: \"If you eat like this, it will be easy to raise, and it will not be a problem to give birth to a big fat boy.\"It was not easy for a countryman to marry a wife and have children. Wang Langzhong was afraid that Lu Gu would have to rest and make others unhappy, so he picked it up. If you said something nice, if you gave a hope, he could treat Lu Gu more kindly.Besides, he didn't just talk nonsense, the red mark between Lu Gu's eyebrows was a little redder than a few days ago, it must be possible to give birth, and this also made him saw that the Shen family seemed to be very kind to Lu Gu.\"Then Uncle Wang, don't you need to take the medicine today?\" Shen Xuanqing asked, and he pretended not to see Lu Wen after looking away.\"No, go back and relax, eat and sleep well, it's better than anything else, by the way, don't be a nonsense.\" Wang Langzhong waved his hand.People in the towns paid attention to medical treatment, but farmers didn't have so much spare money, besides, he had been diagnosed, and Lu Gu had no other serious problems, except that he often didn't eat enough to make his body weak, and he would heal after slowly raising it.\"Thank you so much, Uncle Wang.\" Shen Xuanqing thanked, then Lu Gu got up and walked out with him.Wang Langzhong was not distracted when he was diagnosing the pulse, and explained the matter to Lu Gu, and only now he looked at Lu Wen in the courtyard.\"Uncle Wang, my father has finished taking the medicine, so I'll grab a few.\" Lu Wen explained why he came without waiting for him to ask, and walked into the main room as he spoke, and moved aside by speaking, avoiding Shen Xuanqing and Lu Gu.Lu Daxiang finished taking the medicine yesterday, if he had known that Lu Gu was here today, he should have come yesterday, so as not to run into him.Facing Shen Xuanqing, Lu Wen was a bit guilty. After all, he regretted the marriage first. If he hadn't seen that Shen Xuanqing didn't move or speak, he would have just looked at him coldly without even paying attention to him , otherwise he would have just left.Out of Wang Langzhong's house, for some reason, he was obviously not familiar with him, but Lu Gu felt that Shen Xuanqing was not in a good mood.He knew that it must have something to do with Lu Wen, even when he saw Lu Wen, he remembered the bad things in the past.Lu Daxiang was clearly his father, since Lu Wen followed Du Hehua to remarry , gradually, before he realized it, Lu Daxiang looked like Lu Wen like a real father .Lu Gu was almost eleven years old at that time, although he was not young, but he lost his mother, and his father treated Lu Wen better than him, how could he not feel uncomfortable.Forget about Lu Wen, after that, Du Hehua gave birth to a son. This year, he was only seven years old. This was his own son, and it was not difficult for Lu Daxiang to love him.Lu Wen had been good-looking since he was a child, and his mouth was also sweet. He called daddy and daddy all day long, and when he went out, he said he was my daddy, and even others praised him.This was exactly what Lu Gu didn't understand, he obviously called him father, and when people asked him when he was out, he also said what about my father, but Lu Daxiang liked Lu Wen even more.Later, he heard gossip from some people in the village, but it was such harsh rumors. He was so shocked that he seemed to understand with a pale face.The gossip from that day was still in his ears, so Lu Gu still didn't dare to think about it.And Shen Xuanqing, who was walking next to him, hadn't been with the Lu family for a long time. Seeing Lu Wen he was upset, he naturally had a bad face.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After three years of hard life, now that they just woke up, everyone in the family had smiles on their faces. He also didn't want to lose money, so he moved the Lu family's things and sold them, at least for some money.But Du Hehua's swearing was too harsh, and Lu Daxiang slandered the innocence between him and Lu Gu in front of everyone, and he became angry from the heart, so he stopped holding back.Shen Xuanqing's thoughts gradually returned. When she noticed Lu Gu next to him, he thought that his husband was now Lu Gu and had nothing to do with Lu Wen. He felt a little better, and he felt a little bit better than when he saw Lu Wen, overwhelmed by disgust.On the way home, Lu Wen avoided crowded places and tried his best to keep his head down so as not to be noticed. He lowered his eyes and pursed his lips slightly with an unhappy expression. His mother went to do it, and never thought it would end up like that.But when he found out later, he wasn't too afraid, even if the Shen family really went to the county government, with the Li family around , nothing would happen.The reason why he didn't directly invite the Li family to come was because he wanted a face. After all, his name was written in the marriage letter, and he wouldn't let it go unless it was absolutely necessary. Besides, this matter was really disgraceful. It would be a shame if more people knew about it, even the officials in the county.If he regretted it, he didn't regret it. He was able to agree to the Shen family at that time. Shen Xuanqing was really good-looking, handsome and tall, not to mention the countryside, even in the town.Compared with the villagers who planted food in the crops, the hunter was a business that earned money, otherwise the Shen family wouldn't have given out a dowry gift of twenty taels. After a few years of hard life, he heard people said that It was ginseng that hung Shen Shunfu's life after being ill back then, but in the end he couldn't be rescued. The Shen family owed a hundred taels or more to treat him.But no matter how rich the hunter in the countryside was, it was only a few copper coins , which was incomparable to the young masters in the town, especially the li family was still a wealthy family.If it wasn't for him living alone in the town, he would be gossiped about, otherwise he wouldn't come back, and blamed his family for being poor and having no good relatives in the town, otherwise he could stay temporarily, a former classmate's house for a day or two, It's okay, but it wouldn't last long. Li Lang once said that he would buy him a house to live in, but he was so high-minded, how could he let himself lost the reputation because being raised outside, no matter what, he had to be the husband of Li family with matchmaker.It was not that he didn't know the gossip in the village, but It was easy to deal with. As long as the country people got some benefits, they could talk to him like everything slipped through their fingers.This time Shen Xuanqing came back and stayed at home for three days, which was quite a long time. He didn't go into the mountain immediately. He sold the five-step snake to the medical clinic in the town. The snake gall of the five-step snake was the most precious among snake galls, and that snake was big and good-looking, and after digging out the snake gall, it could be cooked and soaked in the medicinal wine.In the medical hall, he had just poured the fivestep snake out of his bag, when a fat man with a big head slapped the table and told him to let him go back and drank snake wine to strengthen his yang.In the end, he got two ingots of five taels of silver, which were heavy in his hands, and gave Wei Lanxiang one ingot after returning home.At noon that day, Wei Lanxiang took the chickens and ducks and asked Shen Yaoqing and Ji Qiuyue to look after the house. She took Shen Yan, Shen Xuanqing, and Lu Gu to her natal home, paid off the ten taels of silver. After eating a meal, they felt much lighter on the way back.hunters were richer than ordinary farmers, and they usually just sold some common prey and furs, earning small sums of money, which was not bad. If you were lucky and came across a good thing on the mountain, you could sell it for a lot of money, but it all depended on luck.When borrowing money before, because ten taels of silver was not a decimal number, in order not to make mistakes, but also to let the family breathe a sigh of relief, Wei Lanxiang cautiously promised that it would be paid in May next year, they wouldn't have to tighten his belt. Also, the winter wheat in the dry land could be harvested at that time, plus what they had saved during this period, it was enough for ten taels of silver.As soon as Lu Gu got up the next day, Wei Lanxiang called him into the room.She looked at Lu Gu, no matter how she looked at him, she felt that Lu Gu was much more pleasing to the eye than Lu Wen. Not long after he got married, the family's bad luck seemed to be gradually disappearing, and good things came one after another.Although after what happened to Shen Shunfu, how many gods and Buddhas she worshiped and how many kowtows she kowtowed that year, but she didn't save her man, and she didn't believe in it in the future, but people were happy on happy occasions, and Lu Gu was obedient and well-behaved. The smile would be bigger.When Lu Gu came out of her room and saw Shen Xuanqing in the yard, his heart began to beat. Mother said that she would ask him to go into the mountain with Shen Xuanqing early in the morning, and said that they would have a good time. After all, there were only two of them in the mountain. No one else spoke.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Seeing that Shen Xuanqing had nothing else to do, she found him another job. She held the sole of her shoe and said, \"Go prepare a bowl of mushrooms, and then kill that pheasant. When it's over, go to your third uncle\u2019s house, picked a winter melon, and today we will have a winter melon stewed chicken.\u201dThey were busy separately, and when the orange sunset glowed filled the sky, they gathered around the table and ate happily.Stir-fried black mushrooms with garlic slices, mixed with tofu and a pot of stewed chicken, these three items were quite hearty, homemade meals were large, and there were steamed buns, enough for six people.Lu Gu was no longer as cramped and cautious as before, he dared to pick up some food with his chopsticks and ate.The chicken soup was very fresh. After the chicken was scooped up, Ji Qiuyue brought a few bowls over and divided the rest of the soup and finished it, otherwise it would be a pity.The whole family was well fed, and it was getting late after cleaning up. The farmers followed the custom of working from sunrise to sunset, and went back to their houses to rest without even lighting the lamps.Wei Lanxiang still couldn't sleep, so before it was completely dark, she came to help Lu Gu packed his clothes.\"It's cold in the mountains, especially at night, so remember to cover up with more quilts.\" Seeing Lu Gu's three clothes and two pairs of shoes, she pondered for a while and said, \"Your clothes are thin and can't hold you up. I changed it with jacket and brought it for you.\"\"Mother.\" Lu Gu's eyes were timid, but after hearing her words, he didn't know what to say, and finally he called mother in a low voice.Wei Lanxiang saw that he was so obedient, she couldn't close her mouth with a smile, and hurriedly said: \"I'll prepare the lamp for you and bring it tomorrow morning.\"But before going out, she said to Shen Xuanqing: \"Go to the town to buy some cotton and thick cloth, and then make him two thick jacket to wear warmly.\"\"Mother, you use this to buy, and then make more quilts.\" Shen Xuanqing knew what she meant, and from his arm, he took out a few pieces of broken silver.The door was open, and the two of them didn't deliberately lower their voices to avoid anyone. The rest of the family heard it.Wei Lanxiang accepted it with a smile, it was only for Lu Gu to make clothes, and Erqing paid for it, so she could tell the boss.When Shen Yan heard her talking about changing the jacket, she lit a lamp in the room, and the dim candlelight was reflected on the half-opened window, swaying gently with the breeze.Wei Lanxiang dug out the jacket that had been washed before from the bottom of the box, and it was a little small compared to Lu Gu's figure. It was cold in the mountains, so he shouldn't wear this to keep out the cold. This one was actually not too thick. The advantage was that the chest and back were filled with cotton, and it even had two sleeves, so he wouldn't be afraid of freezing his arms.Shen Yan didn't even ask about making thick clothes. She went to the mountains once, and it was cold at night, especially in autumn, when there was more rain, it would get colder. Lu Gu went to cook and do laundry. Brother Erqing could eat delicious hot food, so hunting would be more exciting, right?Even she knew it, how could Ji Qiuyue don't know, the clothes that should be made had to be made, besides , it took some hardships in the mountains, and it took a long time just to travel, so she naturally didn't care.In the room, Lu Gu was supporting the sack, and Shen Xuanqing stuffed the new quilt in the dowry box. He had two quilts in the mountain for a long time. The two sheets could be washed like new .He was busy hunting, and he didn't even know how to remove and wash the bedding. At most, he took advantage of the sunny weather to dry it, and when it was too dirty, he carried it down the mountain and brought it back for Wei Lanxiang to help to wash.Fortunately, the scooter was big enough, and Shen Xuanqing was young and strong. He was only eighteen years old, and when he was very strong, it was not a problem to pull a load of more than two hundred catties, but the road required more effort than usual.In the dead of night, the lights were turned off, the noise gradually subsided, and the moon gradually moved westward in the sky.A few stars twinkled, and it was almost halfway through the night. Lu Gu, who hadn't slept well, woke up after noticing Shen Xuanqing's movement.They cleaned up everything that needed to be cleaned up last night. The two of them woke up, washed their faces with cold water, rinsed their mouths with green salt hastily, and when they were resting on the road, they could eat steamed buns directly without thinking about whether their mouths were clean or not.\"Erqing, Guzi, are you leaving now?\" Wei Lanxiang called through the window, she thought for a while and said, \"I'll send you two off. \"Dahu had been released, and after Shen Xuanqing finished speaking, Lu Gu had finished reciting his bag and carried the egg basket, and he pushed the cart and went out together.Shen Yaoqing sent the two of them out, Lu Gu walked for a while and then turned back, there was no one at the door, under the night, it seemed that only he and Shen Xuanqing were left.The cart squeaked softly, Dahu followed Lu Gu, and the two puppies that had been tied to the backyard for the past few days, and as soon as they were let go, they ran forward, sniffing everywhere, and only stopped when they were far away. Turned their head and waited for Shen Xuanqing to catch up.Gradually reaching the slope up the mountain, Shen Xuanqing reversed the cart, the wheels came to the back, and then put the cloth rope between the two handlebars on his shoulders, so that he could use his body strength to pull the cart up. It was time to use your strength, just kept walking forward, otherwise it would be difficult to push it up with two hands.Lu Gu guarded behind the cart, because he was holding the egg basket in his hand, he couldn't help to push it for fear of breaking it, so he just looked at it so that nothing would fall.Shen Xuanqing was used to do heavy work with all his strength, and he could pull it without his help, so the two of them went up the mountain just like that.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Seeing that Shen Xuanqing had nothing else to do, she found him another job. She held the sole of her shoe and said, \"Go prepare a bowl of mushrooms, and then kill that pheasant. When it's over, go to your third uncle\u2019s house, picked a winter melon, and today we will have a winter melon stewed chicken.\u201dThey were busy separately, and when the orange sunset glowed filled the sky, they gathered around the table and ate happily.Stir-fried black mushrooms with garlic slices, mixed with tofu and a pot of stewed chicken, these three items were quite hearty, homemade meals were large, and there were steamed buns, enough for six people.Lu Gu was no longer as cramped and cautious as before, he dared to pick up some food with his chopsticks and ate.The chicken soup was very fresh. After the chicken was scooped up, Ji Qiuyue brought a few bowls over and divided the rest of the soup and finished it, otherwise it would be a pity.The whole family was well fed, and it was getting late after cleaning up. The farmers followed the custom of working from sunrise to sunset, and went back to their houses to rest without even lighting the lamps.Wei Lanxiang still couldn't sleep, so before it was completely dark, she came to help Lu Gu packed his clothes.\"It's cold in the mountains, especially at night, so remember to cover up with more quilts.\" Seeing Lu Gu's three clothes and two pairs of shoes, she pondered for a while and said, \"Your clothes are thin and can't hold you up. I changed it with jacket and brought it for you.\"\"Mother.\" Lu Gu's eyes were timid, but after hearing her words, he didn't know what to say, and finally he called mother in a low voice.Wei Lanxiang saw that he was so obedient, she couldn't close her mouth with a smile, and hurriedly said: \"I'll prepare the lamp for you and bring it tomorrow morning.\"But before going out, she said to Shen Xuanqing: \"Go to the town to buy some cotton and thick cloth, and then make him two thick jacket to wear warmly.\"\"Mother, you use this to buy, and then make more quilts.\" Shen Xuanqing knew what she meant, and from his arm, he took out a few pieces of broken silver.The door was open, and the two of them didn't deliberately lower their voices to avoid anyone.

People often came here, and there were few wild animals. There was no need to be afraid of bringing dogs. Those ferocious wolves, tigers and leopards were all deeper and farther away in the mountains.After walking for a quarter of an hour, to the forest with few people behind, the sun would come out, and the things that roamed at night would retreat to their nests before the sun came out , so there was no need to be afraid.It was not impossible to travel during the day, but Shen Xuanqing was used to walking at this time, and it was only half of the morning when he arrived in the deep forest house, and the remaining half of the day was enough to do many things.But at this moment, listening to Lu Gu's movements behind him, he thought to himself that next time, he should wait until the daytime to leave. Now that he didn't have to work so hard to pay off the debt, he should take his time and didn't hurry too much.\"These chopped wood piles, keep going forward, and after a few trees in front, you can see the traces of axe cuts on the tree, just follow along.\"Hearing Shen Xuanqing's words, Lu Gu's eyes followed to look at the stake, and he wrote it down carefully.There were still some stepped roads in the front mountain, which disappeared at the back. In order to let him see it more realistically, Shen Xuanqing even told him to go to the front and pointed out the road signs all the wayThe sun hadn't come out yet, but it was much brighter than before. It was a struggle to pull the cart to the end, and when they saw a flat boundary, the two stopped to rest, and ate a steamed bun to cushion their stomachs.Stopping and stopping, originally Shen Xuanqing could get there in an hour and half, but today it took nearly three hours to get there because of pulling a cart.Lu Gu looked at the courtyard in front of him, who would have thought that there was such a tall mud courtyard wall in the deep mountain forest, which was higher than the wall of the house at the bottom of the mountain, and even the courtyard gate was tall, so it looked solid.Seeing the surprise in his eyes, Shen Xuanqing opened the door and pushed the cart in, and told him the reason when unloading.His master, that was, the old hunter, lay down early one evening after drinking alcohol. Before it was dark, he heard movement outside. It was an old bear coming from the depths of the old forest. When it came in, it broke into the kitchen outside and ate all the food.The rice and flour were swallowed, the bags of flour were torn apart and scattered all over the ground, the pumpkins and wild fruits were eaten up, and the litter of rabbits that were captured alive\u00a0 to raise them were all killed by the old bear.Meeting a bear in the mountains was not a trivial matter, especially this kind of bear that had lived for some years. It was like becoming a spirit. It could dig out any delicious food, and it looked terrifying. It could cut a person's head with a claw.The old hunter didn't dare to make a sound in the room, it kept wandering outside, trying to break into the room, wandered around outside a few times, and slammed into the door, fortunately, the old hunter locked the door with a thick tree trunk before going to bed, and after it hit a few times, it didn't break open, then walked to the window and smashed the wooden window with its claws.The old hunter's bed was right under the window. When he realized that the old bear was in front of the window, he quickly turned over and hid under the bed, and he didn't make any movement.The window was so small that the old bear couldn't get in, and it didn't scratch when it stretched its paws in. Maybe it was too lazy to move after eating, so it found a place outside to sleep on its stomach. It snored loudly all night, and the old hunter kept hiding and didn't dare to move under the bed, it could be described as a night of torment.It wasn't until dawn that the old bear had enough to eat and sleep, and then the old hunter dared to show his head, and hurried down the mountain while the sun was bright.Fearing that the old bear would often came to look for food here in the future, he called his whole family, four young and strong men in the village who could build walls with yellow mud and straw, and took some twenty dogs with them. Even the dogs from the next village were borrowed, and a group of people brought hatchets, bows and arrows, and marched into the mountain in a mighty manner.Being a hunter was risky, but it earned more money than ordinary farmers. The old hunter was unwilling to give up this work, so he spent a lot of money to build such a high courtyard wall in the deep mountain, blocking the beasts wandering out of the old forest.Not only the courtyard walls, but also some of the houses that were destroyed were repaired.Now this house was given to Shen Xuanqing to live in when he came to the mountains. It was still strong after more than ten years, not only the courtyard walls, but also the beams and wood. The most indispensable thing in the deep mountains was wood, and no one could manage it here. All the huts were built with good wood, otherwise there would be heavy wind and snow in the mountains, and people would go down the mountain in winter, and if the roof collapsed, they would have no place to live when they came up again in the next spring.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He knew the dangers in the mountains before, but he didn't expect an old bear to come to the place where the two of them were going to live. But after Shen Xuanqing finished speaking, he saw that the courtyard wall was so high, if something really came, it wouldn't be able to break in, so his heart fell back again.He helped to move the dishes on the cart to the kitchen. He took a look at the mess inside, but he didn't dare to speak. He frowned and thought he would clean up after breakfast.The two walked on the road for three hours, the mountain road was not easy to walk, Shen Xuanqing was still pulling a cart weighing more than 200 jin, now he was tired and hungry, Lu Gu saw that there was nothing he could move, so he He rolled up his sleeves and got busy on the stove.He brought about a dozen steamed buns from home, and he could eat them as soon as they were warmed up. He picked up well-ripe vegetables, washed them and fried them, and scrambled a plate of eggs.When he was at Lu's house, he didn't go into the kitchen very often. Du Hehua was afraid that he would steal food, so she watched closely and didn't let him touch those things. After arriving at Shen's house, there was Ji Qiuyue cooking.Eggs were precious, so when he scrambled the eggs, he was very careful, for fear that they would be burnt. Who knew that even with such excessive caution, the eggs still burned a little bit.Lu Gu was so frightened that he quickly took out the eggs, his face was pale, and he didn't dare to take the eggs out for Shen Xuanqing to see.But he was hungry and wanted to see if the meal was good. Shen Xuanqing pursed his lips slightly and came in. This was the first time he had breakfast with Lu Gu. It was different from at home.But as soon as he came in, he saw Lu Gu standing in front of the stove with a pale face, embarrassed, and then looked at the plate of somewhat mushy eggs, and he knew the reason.sometimes someone cooked messily, even Wei Lanxiang used to burn the pot dry when cooking, and the rice in the pot turned into black burnt, but she couldn't bear to throw it out, so she insisted on sharing it with the whole family. Shen Xuanqing still remembered the bitterness of that black burnt rice.Although the eggs were burnt, not all of them were burnt. It was much better than his mother's time.\"Let's eat when we're done.\" He took the egg plate and took the steamed bun basket as he walked out.Not being reprimanded, Lu Gu dared to pant, took the chopsticks and followed out with the bowl of green vegetables.The sun was shining, and it was already noon when the two of them arrived here. After eating, Shen Xuanqing didn't hang around in the mountains like before. He rubbed his shoulders and entered the room. After a whole morning's journey, no matter how strong a person was, he had to rest for a while .Lu Gu was washing the dishes alone in the kitchen. In fact, there were only two pairs of chopsticks and two bowl. It didn't take much effort. But he was so careful, after realizing that there was a figure at the door of the kitchen, Lu Gu, who was squatting down to pack firewood, looked up.Shen Xuanqing held a porcelain bottle in his hand, and held it tightly. After Lu Gu looked over, he lowered his eyes and said in a low voice, \"I can't touch my back shoulder. You can rub some medicine for me.\"Lu Gu was stunned for a moment , then reacted, responded in a low voice, and said quickly after getting up: \"I wash my hands.\"That being the case, Shen Xuanqing went back to the room first, and when Lu Gu came in, he hesitated, and took off his clothes. He looked calm and composed, but in fact he was a little cautious in his actions.The young man in front of him was slender and strong, different from the short and stout one, tall and strong, he was indescribably good-looking. Lu Gu didn't dare to look at him casually, walked behind Shen Xuanqing with his head down, took the porcelain bottle from the table, followed Shen Xuanqing's whispered instructions, poured the red viscous medicine into the palm of his hand, rubbed his hands slightly to warm them up, and then put the palm of your hand on the red mark on Shen Xuanqing's back shoulder and rub it so as to dissolve the medicine.It was different from Shen's house, it was only the two of them here, there was no Shen Yan and Ji Qiuyue who could talk to him, and because he fried the eggs himself, he felt empty in his heart, so he didn't dare to approach Shen Xuanqing even more , so he simply hid to Clean up the kitchen.It didn't take long for the medicine to be applied, but it was quite a long time for Lu Gu. Even if they slept together at night, they were both wearing underwear, and he had never seen Shen Xuanqing who was shirtless. He was originally a tall man who he didn't dare to get close to. After taking off his shirt, his bronze muscles showed a bit of wildness and aggression, which made him even more frightened, almost trembling.Shen Xuanqing was only eighteen years old. He had worked hard in the past few years and honed some muscles that shouldn't be underestimated. However, he was still young, and he was still a green young man. Even so, it was scary enough for Lu Gu.\"Okay .\" Lu Gu's voice trembled a little, and he didn't dare to touch anymore.Shen Xuanqing's Adam's apple moved with his back turned to him, and his voice was deep: \"Well, I'll do the rest.\"Not only his back shoulders, but also his shoulders were red and worn out, even because his little husband's hands were light and soft , let him think a little bit more, and then rubbed the wound on his shoulder, but when he heard Lu Gu's voice trembling slightly, it was obvious that he was still afraid of him, so he stopped thinking about it.Growing up so big, and often doing some physical work, it was common for him to apply medicine for injuries. Sometimes he couldn't reach it and asked others to help, but other people were not as meticulous and gentle as Lu Gu, and when Shen Xuanqing was asked to apply medicine himself, the ears were slightly redLu Gu, who was able to escape, returned to the kitchen. And after he walked the mountain road all morning naturally his legs were tired, so he sat on the small stool while the fire was burning to rest.he was terrified, but his palms were scorching hot. The outrageous thing of touching the flesh of a man made him felt terrified. After a while, he realized that it was Shen Xuanqing, not another man. Speaking of it, there was no need to shy away from it.Even though it was the reason, he was still a little at a loss. In the end, Shen Xuanqing was thinking about his tired legs and feet. After applying the medicine and getting dressed, he called him into the room, and they lay side by side side on the bed as they were at the foot of the mountain.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He was used to live here and never changed it.Because of the coldness in the mountains, only one window was opened on the south wall, the window faced the front yard, and the relatively strong wooden bed in the room was placed on the west side avoiding the window, facing the door horizontally.Lu Gu was lying on the innermost side, there was a narrow gap between the bed and the mud wall, different from that at the bottom of the mountain, Shen Xuanqing's room had elaborate bed curtains, here was a bare board bed, for fear of soiling the mattress by leaning against the mud wall , it was farther away.The sun shone in through the window, bright and majestic, and fine dust could be seen floating in the beam.It was different from working or standing up. Once he lay down and was under the eaves, he felt cool after a short while, but Lu Gu lay straight and didn't even move, let alone pull the quilt.He was nervous, and Shen Xuanqing was also a little nervous, and both of them remained silent .The mountain was quiet, but a few dogs barking outside broke the silence. After going up the mountain, the three dogs were not tied up, and they didn't run around. They just ran and played nearby. When they were thirsty, they went to the river to drink water. Lying down on the ground, Shen Xuanqing knew it was all right after hearing it, but just barked, and stopped paying attention to the outside.He noticed Lu Gu's stiffness, and remembered that when the two of them slept together at night, Lu Gu was also like this, so cautious that he wouldn't turn over even if he was asleep, what he looked like when he was sleeping, and what he looked like when he woke up, rarely would change.Feeling cold, Shen Xuanqing sat up and pulled the quilt from the foot of the bed, covering him and Lu Gu.The new quilt was still in the sack, he was still young and childish, and his shyness hadn't faded away. Shen Xuanqing quietly looked down at the quilt. Fortunately, it had been exposed to the sun a while ago, so it didn't smell bad or dirty.\"Get up early, don't do anything else today, it's okay to sleep for a while.\" After he lay down, he finally found the words.Hearing his deep and steady voice, Lu Gu gradually relaxed for some reason, and finally hummed softly, his stiff body finally relaxed a bit.Chasing the mountain road all morning was not easy for anyone. After relaxing physically and mentally, Lu Gu closed his eyes and gradually fell asleep.Shen Xuanqing also closed his eyes and fell asleep, after a while, when Lu Gu's breathing became stable, he opened his eyes again.The hand that was pressed against his back shoulder when applying the medicine was so soft that he was still thinking about it in a daze.Lu Gu was sleeping next to him, his arm was not far from his arm, as long as he moved a little, he could touch that hand.The lightly clenched hands were hidden under the quilt, no one could see them, not even the person whose hand was clenched knew.This sleep lasted for more than half an hour. When Lu Gu woke up, his fatigue faded a lot, and his spirit returned.In the afternoon, the sun reached the slanting upper part of the west, and it hadn\u2019t set yet. He boiled medicines for repelling snakes and insects bought by Shen Xuanqing, and stirred it with a wooden stick, and it turned into half a pot of black steaming water.Shen Xuanqing found some unused cloth strips for him, and wrapped them around wooden sticks, so that the potion could be applied to the doors and windows. One layer was not enough, and after it dried a little, he had to apply it twice, so that the potion seeping into the wood, so there was always a smell of medicine, which could prevent snakes, insects, rats and ants from crawling into the room and biting people.These things in the mountains were not the same as outside, they were more or less poisonous, if they were fine during the day, they could be seen, killed and thrown out, but at night, people couldn't find it when they were asleep, the pain of being bitten was mild, red, swollen and hard for a few days. Needless to say, pain and itching were uncomfortable.Not counting the firewood room, there were five rooms in total including the kitchen and the small room with sundries. They all had doors and windows, and Lu Gu just applied it to all. He bought it with money, and he was not willing to lose, so he went to apply the firewood door again.Although there were no people and no food in the firewood room, if there was something hiding in the firewood and hay, he had to worry about it, so he might as well wipe it all off.The courtyard door was wide open, and he was busy inside. Shen Xuanqing took the shovel outside and dug a narrow hole around the courtyard. The pit was about as deep as the head of the shovel, which was not too deep. He planned to bury the medicine in it. .When he finished digging and sprinkled the medicine powder inside, Lu Gu finished his work and came out.Seeing Shen Xuanqing tilting the medicine bag while walking and pouring it into the pit, he picked up the shovel on the ground, followed behind and began to fill the soil.\"No, I do it myself.\" Filling the soil was a laborious task, so Shen Xuanqing switched with him.Dahui and the two small dogs watched them work, and they seemed to understand what Shen Xuanqing was doing. The three dogs straddled the narrow pit, half playing and half helping, they used their claws to dig the soil, and it looked quite hard.This scene made Lu Gu had a clear and shallow smile in his eyes. He never smiled very often, and now he smiled gently, but it dissipated in an instant.Shen Xuanqing was filling the soil, and because of the actions of Dahui, he couldn't help laughing, and inadvertently raised his head to look at Lu Gu, and it was this look that made him see that smile.There seemed to be a \"Zheng\" in his heart that broke the strings, making him stunned in place, and it seemed that there were ripples, stirring up a pool of spring water to ripple.he was used to see Lu Gu's cowardly appearance. Where Shen Xuanqing had seen this scene before? At a loss, he panicked, and when he came back to his senses at the end, he only knew that Lu Gu was his husband, fortunately, he was his husband.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If Shen Xuanqing was alone, there was no need to buy these, but when buying medicines, he wanted Lu Gu to come up with him. No matter what, the skin and flesh were tenderer than a rough man, so it was always right to have an extra precaution.It took four whole packs of medicine powder to finish this round. Shen Xuanqing was fast when he was filling the soil. After Lu Gu finished, he would step on the filled soil so that the empty soil could be solidified, so that he wouldn't be afraid when it was rain, the powder was washed away by the rain.After the two of them finished their work, the sun walked to the west again, and without doing anything else today, Lu Gu went to the kitchen to cook.It was autumn here, and they usually ate rice porridge when they got up early. The warm and soft white rice was warm and moist in the stomach. This morning, because they were hungry, they didn't cook rice and only cooked vegetables. This meal they had time to cook rice porridge.There was not much water in the tank, so Shen Xuanqing carried the wooden barrel to the river to fetch water. There was a low place more than a mile away from the house, which was the Qingxi River that flowed from a deeper place, so it was very convenient to fetch water.After the white rice was put into the pot, Lu Gu put the drawer up, put the steamed buns and four sliced pumpkins, added a fire to the bottom of the pot, then turned around and went to the counter to chop vegetables, busy all by himself.Shen Xuanqing ran a few times to fill up the waist-high water tank. At this time, the pot was steaming, and\u00a0 \u00a0the vegetables were cut. He wiped his hands with his apron, squatted on the ground and added two sticks of firewood. Let the fire simmer for a while longer.Shen Xuanqing, who put down the barrel, glanced at the chopping board. There was only one vegetable, which was the winter melon he picked from his third uncle's house yesterday. He brought two big ones, one was enough to fry a big bowl, and Lu Gu also cut three Green Chilies, he planned to use chili to fry.they ate stewed chicken yesterday, but today it was normal to switch back to vegetarian. it was like this in the countryside, and eating meat was only occasionally.But for Shen Xuanqing, he was a hunter, and he was different from the man who worked in the crop field. In the past, he himself was reluctant to eat meat in order to sell it for money on the mountain, so he just dug some wild vegetables and cooked them. Now Lu Gu came up with him, you had to prepare something meaty, even if you didn't eat it all at once, you couldn't suffer if you could cut a piece of pork or sliced meat when cooking.He was so tall here, it was hard for people to ignore him, but fortunately, Lu Gu had work to do, so he wouldn't be embarrassed by standing still.The pumpkin was steamed, and the steamed buns were steaming hot. When he took out the drawer, he saw that the rice porridge was also cooked. It was so hot that it was hard to eat. Just as he was about to stir-fry the vegetables, Lu Gu scooped out the rice porridge first.Shen Xuanqing had nothing to do, but his eyesight was not bad, so he poured a gourd of water into the pot after he scoopped the rice porridge.Lu Gu scrubbed it hastily, wiped the water in the pot dry with a cloth, and added some firewood to the bottom of the stove. Once the fire was hot, the pot dried up visible to the naked eye, and the cooking was done in one go.Seeing that there was only half of the oil left in the clay pot, Shen Xuanqing thought to himself that the oil would be brought up next time, and there were only the two of them, these would be enough for a while, so no need to worry.He was thinking again, if it was getting colder today, a can of lard would be delicious to cook. Now wild boars were all in the deep forest. If you were lucky, you could meet one. If you couldn\u2019t meet them in half a month, you should go to the town to buy some fat meat and came back.Lu Gu didn't know what he was pondering about, but he just saw that the dishes were fried and not sticky, and his heart was at peace.During the meal, Lu Gu also picked up a small bowl of pickled vegetables, steamed buns and rice porridge, steamed pumpkin and stir-fried vegetables, one meal was enough to satisfy the two of them.They had eaten early today, and the sun was just about to set when Lu Gu finished cleaning up in the kitchen.Shen Xuanqing didn't intend to go out to see those traps. Firstly, it was tiring to drive the cart in the mountain road, and secondly, it was because of selfishness. He looked at Lu Gu and couldn't help wanting to get closer.As for what to do after getting close, he couldn't think of it himself. With a calm and handsome face with little expression, his heart was tangled and tense. In the end, he couldn't think of a reason, so he had to give up.\"I'm going to set up a net in the river, will you go?\" Shen Xuanqing asked, and then added: \"Let you recognize the nearby road.\"Lu Gu came out of the kitchen and was thinking about what to do, when he heard the words, he moved a little, nodded, followed him out together.The river was not far away, and you could see it at a glance to the west from the gate of the courtyard. Two pepper trees were planted on the west side of the courtyard wall. When the trees grew up, they were like a barrier, and the two were not small when they were connected together.It was early autumn, and the green pepper will turn red after a while. Now that they were close, they could still smell a faint numbness.\"There were more than 30 miles in there, and you will go deeper into the old forest. Don't go there if you have nothing to do. The old forest was dense and it was difficult to get out without a dog. I don't go there often, so don't go there.\"Shen Xuanqing carried the net on his back, pointed to the north while walking and told Lu Gu, and finally he also said: \"If you have something urgent to go back and you don't remember the way you come, you won't get lost if you follow the river. However, some parts of the river are difficult to walk, and you have to detour in the mountains before flowing down.\"\"Yeah, I see.\" Lu Gu nodded seriously.Dahui and the little dog were eating in the courtyard. They smelled the hot wheat bran and flour mixed with leftover soup in the basin, turned their heads and were reluctant to eat, but Shen Xuanqing went out, obviously there was no bone or stick today, so they had to accept their fate and bowed their heads to eat.Shen Xuanqing never treated the dogs badly. After all, if he wanted them to hunt along with him, they needed to have good physical strength. He could raise the three of them so that their fur were smooth, but they couldn't gnaw on their bones every day.After he cast his net by the river, the three dogs ran over after eating, and circled around them.Having been frightened by the black dog before, Lu Gu didn't dare to get close to them, but Dahui was okay, he followed his legs to protect him when he went up the mountain, he seemed very loyal, he even dared to touch Dahui's head.Shen Xuanqing tied the edge of the net to the big rock on the river bank, and when he came back tomorrow morning, some fish might be caught.The river was rushing and flowing, and the afterglow of the setting sun shone on the water surface, which was really beautiful.The mountains and forests were quiet, and sometimes there was a mellow or crisp bird song, which made people forgot their minds, as if they were in that paradise, far away from the entanglement of the world.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As a result, others saw him and laughed at him for being stupid , and he felt embarrassed. It was rarely like that after that.After returning home, a very thick tree trunk leaned against the wall next to the courtyard door. Shen Xuanqing closed the courtyard door, and then struggled to half hug and half drag the heavy long tree trunk against the door. Even the bears couldn't break through the gate.Ever since the old hunter went through that incident, he even taught Shen Xuanqing how to do it, and he often told him that he must press the door well at night , otherwise he would die.While it was still dark, Lu Gu boiled water for the two of them to wash and wash their feet. It was really cold in the deep mountains, and the cold came after the sun went down. Fortunately, Wei Lanxiang brought him a jacket.The crescent moon hung quietly in the sky, the windows creaked and were closed, and the room became much darker, and only outlines could be seen in the haze.Lu Gu was sleeping in the bed, Shen Xuanqing closed the window and groped into bed. The quilt was lifted and closed again, and there was a warm and tall man beside him.Lu Gu only slept with Shen Xuanqing, and lying next to such a tall and strong man, he sometimes felt oppressed and afraid, and when he was thinking wildly, he once thought about it, could it be that all married shuang'er and girls were afraid of the men around them at night .But these words must never be said to the second person. He was ashamed, so naturally he couldn't say it, and he didn't even dare to think about it because he was too outrageous.Both inside and outside the house were very quiet, they covered two layers of quilts, and they warmed up after lying down, and Lu Gu gradually fell asleep.The other person on the bed couldn't fall asleep for a long time.Shen Xuanqing didn't know what was wrong with him, listening to the soft and shallow breathing in his ears made him even more impatient. As for what he was impatient with, he couldn't tell, he just felt like something was missing in his hands, and there seemed to be something in his chest that couldn't be filled, empty and empty.When the forest became quieter, you could hear the faint rustling of the wind outside. Lu Gu's breathing was steady, apparently he was in a deep sleep.Shen Xuanqing turned over gently, grabbed the soft hand under the quilt, and gradually clenched it tightly, so that the palm of the hand was at ease.People were greedy, just looked at whether the greed was big or small.He held his hand, and he should have fallen asleep like at noon, but he didn't know whether it was the long night or something, but the closer he got, he could smell the warmth and softness of Lu Gu's body, the hotter the bed, it was so clean and soft, the smell seemed to come out more and more.Shen Xuanqing was almost in a mess, he was a reckless boy who was only eighteen years old, and he had never even held Shuang'er's hand before, let alone facing this charming that only he was aware of.The night blinded the vision, invisible but tangible, since no one could see, it strengthened the courage.When Lu Gu was still at Shen's house last night, he didn't sleep well because he was worried about going up the mountain, and today he walked the mountain road for a long time during the day. Didn't wake him up.After hugged him into his arms, Shen Xuanqing breathed a sigh of relief, his empty chest was filled, and it turned out that people often said the word \"satisfied\", that's it.The dew was very heavy in the morning, and it didn't take long to walk into the grass, and the trousers on the uppers of the shoes would be wet. After Lu Gu woke up, Shen Xuanqing had already dressed and got out of bed. As for sleeping in each other's arms last night, he didn't know at all.The usual thing after got up early was to boil water and ate steamed buns, which was no different from that at the foot of the mountain.\"I'm late, I can't make it for lunch, you can eat by yourself, you don't need to wait for me.\" Shen Xuanqing carried a long hatchet, a bow and arrow, and a bamboo basket on one shoulder, with hemp rope and a small cloth bag of steamed buns in the basket.The two of them crossed the threshold, and outside the courtyard, he turned his head and told Lu Gu: \"There are no wild animals in the forest around here, but don't run too far, it won't be too late to go out after I get you familiar with this place.\"Nodding in response, Shen Xuanqing had nothing to say after explaining, and paused for a while before saying: \"Then I'm leaving.\"After he finished speaking, he didn't hesitate anymore, and headed to the east, and the three dogs ran towards the forest in a familiar way.Lu Gu watched, the dog barking gradually faded away, and as Shen Xuanqing's figure disappeared into the forest, he could no longer see him, he felt a bit of emptiness and silence, he was the only one left here.Birds fluttered their wings and the sun rose, bringing some warmth. Lu Gu went back alone, because the sun was not yet bright, he was panicked, turned around and closed the courtyard door, surrounded by high walls, he felt at ease.The front yard was quite big, but it hadn\u2019t been taken care of much. The long and heavy axes were thrown on the ground, and there were a lot of unsplit firewood scattered here and there. Juicy.Lu Gu picked up the ax and leaned it against the wall, and piled the unsplit wood next to the firewood shed, at least they were neatly put together.He either washed or wiped the chopping boards, stoves, pots and bowls in the kitchen, and dusted the small jars of oil, salt, sauce and vinegar.Because it was difficult to transport things in the mountains, except for the water tank, the rice,\u00a0 and flour were all in cloth bags and placed on the mud platform on the other side of the chopping board. Otherwise if there was water on the ground, wetting the cloth bag would easily make the rice and flour damp and moldy, so it was good to put it in a high place.He took a broom and swept the house and the kitchen again. There were many trees on the mountain, but there were fewer leaves in the front yard and the backyard where there was no tree, because the trees around the yard had been cut down to avoid blocking the sun. Enough open space, so that there were no trees blocking the way when you went out.When Lu Gu finished his work, the sun rose and shone brightly on the world, he dared to go out. Seeing that the water in the water tank was low, he went out to fetch water with a wooden bucket, and when he got to the river, he remembered the net that Shen Xuanqing had laid yesterday, not far away.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 40": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Sweet Little FulangCH 21.2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySure enough, a big fish was caught in the net. It was too big to get out of the net, so it bumped and stirred wildly. The fish twisted so badly that the water splashed out.The fish hadn't been caught for a long time, and the strength hadn't been exhausted yet. The net was not too big, and it could be lowered in the gentle and narrow section of the river where the water and grass were lush. Lu Gu was afraid that the big fish would break through the net and ran away, so he quickly collected the fish.He worked a lot, and he still had some strength in his hands, but the fish was slippery. He was afraid that the net would be broken, so it took him a while to get the big fish out of the entangled fishing net.Now that he caught it, there was no coarse salt to pickle the fish here, and he couldn't take it down the mountain to sell. He remembered that he had heard people say that the fish stewed with pepper and chili peppers was delicious and spicy. It was time to eat something meaty, and it was cold in the evening, so it was warm to eat a stewed fish.Lu Gu glanced at the fish in the wooden bucket, and thought that there was water here, so it was better to take a knife and killed it by the river, so as not to pollute the yard.It could be said that he was the only one in a ten-mile radius. He took the knife and came over, but the wooden barrel was still in place.This fish was too big, it was not dead right now, it fell out and fluttered on the ground, it was slippery, Lu Gu couldn't hold it down a few times, let alone kill it, the head of the fish was also big, he slapped it a few times with a knife but it didn't faint from the shot, so he had to pick up a fairly clean stone and smashed it to death.After dissection and scraping the scales, he cleaned up the big fish. He washed the kitchen knife and the blood on his hands, and went back with the fish in one hand and half a bucket of water in the other hand.There were plenty of meat fish after it was chopped into pieces. Lu Gu used a wooden basin to hold them. After chopping, he didn't take a break. He carried the wooden bucket and ran a few times, filling the water tank until full.He was busy in and out of the courtyard by himself, and felt the sun was shining brightly in the courtyard, but it was already noon.This meal should be rice porridge, but he added a small handful of rice and a ladle of water by himself, and it was easy to burn the pot.He also thought that rice porridge was good for people, and if Shen Xuanqing wanted to eat it, he could make more, scooped out a large bowl from the pot and put it away. When Shen Xuanqing came back, he even put the bowl in the drawer and heated it up.In the main room, Lu Gu had lunch alone.There was not much rice in his bowl, he only scooped up the thin porridge on it, and the dishes were simple, only half a bowl of pickles, and he ate two steamed buns.Such a simple meal was enough for him. When he could eat in the Lu family, he ate leftovers, most of which were cold, which couldn't compare to hot rice porridge and hot steamed buns.Shen Xuanqing was not around, so he didn't dare to eat those dishes.The vegetables they brought were mostly green onions, ginger, and garlic, such as green vegetables, autumn spinach, autumn cowpeas, and winter melons. They would wilt after a few days when they were dug out, and they couldn't bring too much If there were too many vegetables and they were rotten It was a pity, he had to dig wild vegetables in the mountains in the future.People in the country didn't feel rare if they ate too much wild vegetables, and the vegetables they grew were expensive. Of course, Lu Gu didn't dare to eat alone behind his back.The sky was blue and high, and thin clouds drifted past like a light mist. Lu Gu found a hoe to loosen the soil in the vegetable field in the front yard, and ran back and forth three times with the wooden bucket, watering several rows of vegetables.he had been busy for most of the day by himself, and now he stopped, there was silence in his ears, no one's voice was heard.He put the barrel back to the door of the kitchen, and stood there in a daze after he had no work to do. The secluded forest gave him a kind of hesitation and loneliness, as if he was the only one left in the world, abandoned outside bythe world.Shen Xuanqing would come back.Lonely and helpless, he thought of Shen Xuanqing, and he was firm in his heart, Shen Xuanqing would be back soon.Lu Gu made himself busy again, and there were only ten steamed buns left. Shen Xuanqing ate a lot, and it was not enough for two days. With the pot empty, he started making pancakes.Wei Lanxiang specifically told him to eat pancakes in exchange steamed buns , and he would get tired of eating only one thing all day long. People lived to earn this mouthful of food, not only to be full, but to be happier when they could eat well.Although the thick pancakes he baked were not as fragrant as the oiled shortbread, they were more chewy and more delicious, because they were baked on the bottom of the pan, round and thick, and one was as big as three shortbread. It was also very full, and it was very durable to bring one as dry food when you were on the road.There were five big ones and one small baked in a pot. If you usually ate them, you cut them into four. According to Lu Gu's own appetite, one fourth of the big pancakes was enough.six pancakes plus those steamed buns were enough for the two of them to eat for several days, so Lu Gu didn't make any more.It was getting late, so he went outside the door to pick peppercorns, and while there was fire at the bottom of the pot, he started to stew the fish, maybe when Shen Xuanqing came back, he could just eat it.The autumn peppercorns brought here were still green, and they look good together with red dried chili peppers. The autumn peppercorns would disappear after a few days, and only dried chili peppers would be eaten in the future.Although Lu Gu had never stewed fish, he remembered it when Ji Qiuyue stewed spicy rabbit meat. He fried red and green chili peppers and Chinese prickly ash with less oil. The numbness and spicy taste made him cough and teared up. Fortunately, it would be less stronger after pouring the fish meat and adding water.Soon the pot was gurgling, spicy and tangy, and the pot was neither sticky nor spoiled. He was very happy, if his mother was still there, he would definitely say that he was really good.The fire at the bottom of the stove was changed to a small fire, Lu Gu looked at the gate of the courtyard, and there was no one in the forest, not even a dog barking.Waiting was the longest, making people gradually startled. Lu Gu looked at the gate for a long time before going back to add two sticks of firewood.The sun was setting in the west, he added firewood several times, added water to the pot twice, and set up a drawer to heat the rice porridge, but Shen Xuanqing still didn't come back.Hunting was like this, coming back sooner or later, he told himself, maybe he would see someone when he looked up.The afterglow of the setting sun shone in front of the house, and Lu Gu sat on the threshold with a panicked expression.It was getting dark, if Shen Xuanqing didn't come back, there were wolves and old bears in the old forest, what if something happened, he didn't know the way, he couldn't even find Shen Xuanqing.These terrifying thoughts made his face turned pale, he had no time to think about the fish in the pot now, and for the first time waiting for Shen Xuanqing to return late, he was full of panic.Until a few barking dogs broke the silence of the evening, Lu Gu looked over subconsciously, and saw Shen Xuanqing appearing in the forest, already very close.And when Shen Xuanqing got closer, he seemed to have just realized that he got up and was about to meet him, but he stopped his pace immediately and stood there for a while, finally regained his composure, and said with a trembling voice: \"You come back .\"Shen Xuanqing had come to the front, and when he heard the words, his eyes seemed guilty, and he said in a low voice, \"you have been waiting for a long time.\"In the forest, he saw Lu Gu sitting on the threshold, thin, gazing at the east with a terrified and pitiful expression, as if he had been waiting there for a long time, and didn't even react until he came over.Shen Xuanqing, who originally brought back something good, felt a little pain in his heart because of this scene. Although he hadn't expressed love at this time, but Lu Gu waited for him like this, even a man couldn't be hard- hearted. This was his husband, but he didn't take good care of him, which made him felt guilty, so he unloaded the bamboo basket, took out something wrapped in several layers of big leaves from inside, and after peeling it off , a golden honeycomb was revealed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 41": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Sweet Little FulangCH 22.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAs soon as you picked up the golden honeycomb, you could see the honey flowing slowly from a small opening. Lu Gu was a little panicked at first, but when he saw that the honey was about to flow down, he quickly turned around while saying: \"I'll go take the bowl.\"Shen Xuanqing wrapped the honeycomb with big leaves and followed him, the bamboo basket was placed at the gate of the courtyard without carrying it, and said: \"There is an empty jar next to the stove, use that.\"Lu Gu listened to him, took the jar to wash it, and wiped it dry with a cloth towel.Shen Xuanqing took the small wooden spoon on the chopping board, it was used by Lu Gu when making the pancakes, it was not stained like the wooden spoon for cooking, it was relatively clean.The honeycomb was not that hard , and could be cut or squeezed with a wooden spoon. Lu Gu put the small jar on the chopping board, and couldn't help standing here watching the honey flow into the jar. The two stood together, if it wasn't for Shen Xuanqing was too high, it would be head to head.The golden honey was bright, and it smelled mellow and sweet. The honeycomb in the mountains were not only on the trees. There were clusters of honeycombs under the cover of weeds and wild flowers. Took the time to find it.Shen Xuanqing found a lump of honeycomb in the grass today, the honey couldn't flow completely, even after being squeezed, he picked a better place and broke off a piece and handed it to Lu Gu.Seeing that Lu Gu was hesitating, Apparently he had never eaten it, he said in a low voice: \"you can eat it, just chew for some sweetness, don't swallow it.\"When he was a child, his mother gave him honey water or dipped honey with chopsticks and stuffed into his mouth and let him taste it, but the honeycomb had never been eaten, and when he heard that it was edible, Lu Gu bit it carefully. The mellow and sweet taste made his eyes widen as soon as he took it in, and Shen Xuanqing, who looked at him, smiled unconsciously.Speaking of which, Shen Xuanqing was only half a year older than Lu Gu, and he was young enough that his face was actually a bit green. This smile faded away from his usual stability and maturity, and there seemed to be warmth in his eyes, just like the sun in the sky. It made Lu Gu inexplicably felt at ease, and he didn't even feel so embarrassed about his clumsy appearance that he hadn't eaten any good food.He was thinking again, Shen Xuanqing was a good person, and if he was given such a sweet honeycomb , he would not really laugh at him for not eating a good one.\"Don't throw this away, keep it for you to eat every day.\" Shen Xuanqing broke off a small piece for himself, and put the squeezed and deformed honeycomb into the bowl.The sweet taste overflowed in the mouths of the two of them, and no matter how bad their emotions were, they were appeased. Before Lu Gu finished eating, he asked, \"Are you hungry? I stewed fish.\"As soon as he entered the kitchen, he could smell the spicy taste, but because honey was important, Shen Xuanqing didn't bother to ask about it. At this moment, he nodded his head and said frankly: \"I'm hungry.\"After running in the mountains for a day, he brought a few steamed buns as dry food. How could he not hungry?Lu Gu didn't eat honeycomb anymore, and lifted the lid of the pot to bring out the rice porridge, and filled a large bowl of stewed fish. Although it had been stewed for a long time, the pot was not burnt after adding water, only the fish sticking to the pot was a little burnt. Spices and salt had been added, the taste was not too bad.By the time the food was served, it was dark outside.Shen Xuanqing brought the bamboo baskets in and sealed the gate of the courtyard. It got dark quickly, so they had to light the oil lamps that they didn't usually use.The dogs wandered around, Shen Xuanqing threw a steamed bun into each of them, and let them eat freely, so as not to come over during the meal, and said to Lu Gu: \"No need to feed at night, they caught a few big bamboo rats before they came back I\u2019ve roasted it and they ate it.\u201dDahui and the others were used to eat leftovers, and the bones was made for stewed soup and left some meat on top for the three of them to eat, so they got used to eat cooked food, Shen Xuanqing found a safe place to light a fire and roast it at will, and also got some water for himself in a bamboo tube to drink.Farmers' dogs sometimes couldn't eat at home, so they would dig outside to find something to eat. The country people had long been used to it, but they could catch big bamboo rats to eat, which was still very powerful in Lu Gu's ears.The pancakes baked in the afternoon was still fluffy. The thick pancake itself could be eaten cold without reheating.Although the taste of Lu Gu's stewed fish was not as good as that of Ji Qiuyue and Wei Lanxiang, but this was the first time he cooked it, and it was good to be able to do it like this.he didn't know if this was the first time for Shen Xuanqing. For him, he could have a bite of hot food and hot dishes after hunting, and he didn't need to cook it himself.Such a big pancake couldn't be eaten, at least two or three meals, but with the addition of Shen Xuanqing, there would be only soup left after eating.This soup was so spicy and spicy that the dog poured it all out, as long as the meat was gone, it was not a pity.It was getting dark, and Lu Gu was washing the pots and dishes in the kitchen. He originally could see it by the moonlight, but after a while Shen Xuanqing came in with an oil lamp , and the kitchen was much brighter.\"Boil some water. I'll wash at night. There's a lot of firewood in the forest.\" Shen Xuanqing put the oil lamp away, and went to the woodshed to gather firewood after speaking.Because it was something like taking a bath, he didn't look at Lu Gu's eyes when he was talking. If he was tired when he came back, he would wash his face and went to sleep, but it would be different from now on .If the body was dirty and smells of sweat, wouldn't it be dirty to your husband.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After Lu Gu blew out the oil lamp, he sat back in front of the stove to add firewood.Shen Xuanqing came in with a bamboo basket from the outside, he didn't know what was going on, and subconsciously turned his face away.Seeing his dazed eyes, Shen Xuanqing's Adam's apple moved slightly, walked to the stove and squatted down halfway, and took out the things in the bamboo basket by the light of the fire.On the top was a ball of cloth, which was usually used to spread the prey on the street, otherwise it was directly placed on the ground and soiled, and some people in the town would be picky.Lu Gu originally thought that the cloth ball should be put aside, but he didn't expect that it wrapped something, which looked like eggs.\"I caught a bamboo chicken, the female, and she was so frightened that she gave birth to an egg as soon as I caught it.\" Shen Xuanqing's voice was slightly smiling.He put the eggs into Lu Gu's hands, and took out the hemp rope from the big bamboo basket. Below that was the bamboo chicken. It was not dead yet. Chickens were not very courageous. Although their eyes were open, they were still alive.Besides the bamboo chicken, there were two fat doves and a pair of hares. He shot down the fat doves with a slingshot when he heard the sound. It didn't move, and it looked like it was dead, but it was just a fake death.Now Shen Xuanqing's hunting skills were quite good, even the dogs had been trained. The bamboo chickens were only injured in their wings, and they were alive just like the rabbits. In the past, he used to be heavy-handed sometimes, or he didn't kill the wild animals in time. If the prey was taken out of the dog's mouth, the prey would be killed. Generally, this kind of food couldn't wait too long, so you had to go down the mountain to sell it as soon as possible.The living things were easy to handle. After a few days of raising a bunch of things, took them down the mountain and sold them together, saving you a lot of trips.Lu Gu held the egg and watched Shen Xuanqing took out one thing after another, even if it wasn't for him, but the joy of harvest, just looking at it could make people felt happy.No wonder he had been there all day, these were not a waste of time.He thought about it now, Shen Xuanqing often went into the mountains, so he naturally knew how to avoid danger. He was too scared in the afternoon, and he frightened himself to death. Shen Xuanqing would often go hunting in the future. You had to get used to it.He secretly felt embarrassed, fortunately Shen Xuanqing didn't know what he was thinking.Shen Xuanqing took out all the things, raised his head after a pause, and said to Lu Gu: \"This rabbit is still alive, if it can be kept, it happens to be a pair, and it will be raised to give birth to cubs, and they can be sold when they grow up.\"Hearing this, Lu Gu hesitated, and asked in a low voice: \"Then I'll weave them a cage to keep them?\" He knew how to weave bamboo cages, and when Lu Daxiang couldn't find a part-time job to do in the slack time, he would go to the mountains to cut bamboo and he had to weave things made of bamboo strips to sell.Hearing this, Shen Xuanqing pushed the rabbit to his feet and said, \"Well, I'll keep it for you. It's easy to feed. It's enough to pull some grass outside, and you don't even need water.\"There were green grasses everywhere in the forest, There was no need to run far, Lu Gu nodded in response.At this time, the water boiled, and Shen Xuanqing got up first to uncover the pot lid. Seeing that there was a lot of water, his throat tightened, and he turned his head and asked, \"Would you like to wash first?\"Lu Gu was obviously flustered. When they were at the foot of the mountain, Ji Qiuyue and the others would boil a pot of water and scrub their body every few days. They took advantage of the time when there was no man in the house.After working for the past two days, he must have been covered with dust. If he could scrub it with hot water, it would be great. Moreover, he himself didn't dare to refuse Shen Xuanqing, so he lowered his head and said \"OK\" in a low voice like a mosquito. Fortunately, there were only the two of them here, and there was no other movement, otherwise Shen Xuanqing would not have heard it.The two took turns scrubbing in the kitchen. There was a fire burning at the bottom of the stove, and once the kitchen door was closed, it was warm and not too cold.Lu Gu didn't dare to delay, he lay down first after hastily washing, there was no light in the room, his ears were slightly burning in the night, and it didn't subside for a long time.While he was scrubbing, Shen Xuanqing waited in the west room and didn't come out of the room, but for a Shuang'er who didn't even understand human affairs, being known by a man that he was undressing and scrubbing was enough to make him felt hot and afraid to see anyone.Because Shen Xuanqing washed his hair, he put more firewood in front of the stove and warmed it up for a long time. After a long delay, Lu Gu's embarrassment subsided after he came in, and he felt sleepy.There were more people in the bed, and they were so close, Lu Gu could smell the wild bath beads in Shen Xuanqing's hair, it was faint, and it smelled clean.He didn't dare to wash it in such a cold night, because he was still very cold, so he thought, he should also washed his hair at noon tomorrow when the sun was shining, otherwise if it got dirty, he would be disgusted.It was getting late, and the two of them didn't speak in the dark, each fell asleep thinking about their own thoughts.In the middle of the night, Lu Gu, who was supposed to be sound asleep, woke up in a daze. He dreamed that his hands and feet were tied up and felt uncomfortable. He never thought that he would find himself in Shen Xuanqing's arms after waking up.Being hugged by such a tall man, he was so frightened that he immediately woke up, his heart seemed to tremble, and tremblingly tried to roll back from the man's embrace to his original position, but Shen Xuanqing moved, hugged him even tighter.He clung to that hard and strong chest, broad and powerful, unshakable.Lu Gu was neither tall nor short, he was an ordinary boy, sometimes he could show some height when he met someone who was shorter, but in front of the overly tall Shen Xuanqing, he was like a skinny chick. There was no need to struggle in someone's arms.His heart was beating incessantly. The heat and oppressive feeling on the young and strong man made him panic. He was nervous in the dark alone, and the person holding him never let go, as if he had fallen asleep, too much didn't even wake up when he moved around.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He was hugged to sleep all night, when he woke up in the morning, Shen Xuanqing let him go calmly, but he couldn't be so calm.he thought Shen Xuanqing was going to take the dog into the mountain again after eating and drinking, but he didn't go today. The tall young man raised a long machete and said, \u201cThere was a bamboo forest not far from here. I'll go and chop some bamboo. Come back to weave bamboo cages, will you go?\"His eyes were full of expectation, he didn't leave after speaking, he obviously wanted to go together, no matter how stupid Lu Gu was, this could still be seen, he nodded after hesitating.Shen Xuanqing breathed a sigh of relief, he knew what happened to Lu Gu last night, the movement in his arms was so obvious, he could have woken up, but out of some selfishness, he pretended to be asleep and didn't let go, the softness in his arms allowed him to relax. A good night's sleep.Lu Gu carried an empty bamboo basket with a hatchet inside, and Shen Xuanqing carried a machete and hemp rope. Although they were in the mountains, they still locked the door.The dog trotted through the woods, sniffing everywhere, and sometimes raised its hind legs to urinate on tree roots to mark it.After walking for about two quarters of an hour, Lu Gu saw the dark green bamboo grove in front of him. Shen Xuanqing said that there were autumn bamboo shoots in it, which were not as crisp and tender as spring bamboo shoots, but they could be stewed with fat dove in soup, and they could be boiled to make pickles, but the two of them only had a pickle jar, and they hadn't finished eating, so they didn't need to pickle at the moment.So after arriving at the place, Shen Xuanqing went to cut bamboo by himself. He was looking for bamboo shoots in the bamboo forest. Seeing him walking aside, Dahui followed, and the two dogs scattered in the forest, finding a pothole or something. When they dispersed, they were always where Shen Xuanqing could see them.As for Lu Gu, this bamboo forest was deeper and quieter than the one in the front mountain. The autumn bamboo shoots were quite big, and he took a hatchet and slashed them hard several times before breaking them off. Since it would only to be eaten in soup, one large autumn bamboo shoot was enough, but since they all came here, and he still cut two.He memorized the road to the bamboo forest, so he could come and find it by himself when he wanted autumn bamboo shoots in the future.The long bamboo fell down, making a dull sound in the air, Lu Gu walked over with the bamboo basket on his shoulders, and whispered to Shen Xuanqing who was looking at him: \"When I came in, I saw mushrooms outside, I'm looking for it.\"Shen Xuanqing couldn't help it, and said: \"You shout loudly, let the dog follow you.\"Taking a dog in the mountains was a reassuring thing, Lu Gu listened to him, and shouted loudly. As expected,\u00a0 DaHui followed him.Someone in the village died from eating poisonous mushrooms. It happened when he was a child. Lu Gu always remembered it, so he only dared to pick what he knew.He was lucky today, he found a cluster of xanthella mushrooms, the florets were so big, one flake can fry for half a bowl, not to mention that there were several flakes in this nest.Looking under the tree, he could still hear the sound of chopping bamboo. He looked back from time to time, afraid that he would not see the bamboo forest if he walked far away.For unfamiliar mountains and forests, it was always good to be cautious, otherwise, if you stray into the dense forest, there would be trees everywhere, and you wouldn't be able to tell the direction at all, let alone go out.Some mushrooms looked good on the surface, but when they were picked up, insects and ants gnawed them under the canopy, so he threw them away.he walked all the way to search, maybe there were few people in the deep mountains, and the mushrooms hadnt rotted yet, so he found a lot. If he couldn't finish eating them in two days, he could dry them in the sun and save them for late autumn and winter, not afraid of picking more.When he realized that he couldn't hear the sound of chopping bamboo, he hurriedly called Dahui to go back. He didn't feel it when he was looking for the mushrooms, but he didn't realize that he had walked a long way when he walked back.Before entering the bamboo grove, he saw Shen Xuanqing coming out. Seeing him coming back, his expression didn't look so bad, and he said, \"I'm going to call you.\"You could only call to find someone in the mountains. Lu Gu brought a dog again, and Dahui's ears were sharper than a human's, and he ran towards the sound after a shout .Lu Gu quickly said: \"I didn't pay attention when I was looking for the mushrooms, and I walked away.\"Afraid of being blamed, he also showed the bamboo basket to Shen Xuanqing, carefully asking for credit.Shen Xuanqing glanced at the mushrooms in the basket, there were quite a lot of them, seeing Lu Gu's fear, his face became more gentle, and said: \"Well, it's fine, the bamboo was cut, and I'll tie it up and drag it back.\"After not being reprimanded, Lu Gu felt at ease, carried the bamboo basket on his back and went into the bamboo forest with Shen Xuanqing.The weight of the six long bamboos was really not light. Shen Xuanqing tied the bamboos together with hemp rope, and carried the bamboo on his shoulders.Of course, this was for him, if it was Lu Gu, it would be heavy enough to carry two bamboos, and the wet green bamboos just cut down were so tall, it really wasn't light.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Shen Xuanqing scolded them, the gray and white dog let go, and the black dog took it back.On the way back, Lu Gu looked at the wormwood in the field. When he was in Lu's house, Du Hehua bought cloth heads and colorful embroidery thread and asked him to make a sachet or medicine pouch. Regardless of the sachet or medicine pouch, he would put some wormwood leaves in it.When Wei Lanxiang bought colored thread that day, he thought about it a little. When his mother was around, she was good at embroidery. She embroidered the sachet and medicine pouch delicately and beautifully, and it sold well in the town, so at that time, his mother had some money in her hand, so that he could live a good life for a few days when he was a child.His mother left early, so that he didn't learn all the embroidery, but he still had some points, and it was no problem to embroider a medicine pouch, but he didn't have a copper coin, no money to buy cloth and embroidery thread, and no medicinal materials. He didn't have the guts to ask the Shen family for money, but after seeing the red goji berries covered with twigs, his heart moved slightly, and he had an idea.Even if goji berries were cheap, they were worth selling more, and there were many good things in the mountains, as long as you worked hard to find them, you could always find some that sold for money.If he could really sell it for money, even if he didn't buy colored threads, it would at least make Shen Xuanqing happier, and maybe he could be given a few copper coins, so that he would have money.Thinking of this, Lu Gu quietly glanced at Shen Xuanqing who was walking in the front with the bamboo on his shoulders.He was timid and stupid and had no idea, but he had a little selfishness in his heart. He knew that Shen Xuanqing was a good person. If not, he wouldn't take the initiative to make money like this, or he would be like Du Hehua and took all the money away, he didn't even have a penny.He secretly calculated in his heart, but he didn't dare to say anything, he only paid attention to what was on the way back.When he reached the open space outside the courtyard, Shen Xuanqing threw the heavy green bamboo on his shoulders on the ground, and turned his shoulders a few times before opening the lock.The black dog put the killed bamboo rat on the ground, barked several times, and motioned to roast delicious meat for it, but Shen Xuanqing ignored it, opened the door, unloaded the bamboo basket from Lu Gu's back, and carried it in.\"I'm going to kill birds by the river. There's a medicine stove in the house. You can look for it and use that to make soup later.\" He said as he took the two fat doves, which were shot down with a slingshot yesterday. It was time to die, just to make a meaty meal.Lu Gu complied naturally, searched around the house according to his instructions, and found the medicine stove covered with a thick layer of dust.This was used by the old hunter. Shen Xuanqing was young and strong. He hadn't been sick a few times in the past few years. Occasionally, he had a typhoid fever and drank a bowl of ginger soup. The medicine stove was basically never used.It took a long time to cook the stewed soup, and\u00a0 they couldn\u2019t eat it at noon, and the big pot needed to be fried and cooked, so the stewed soup couldn\u2019t be taken up. Fortunately, there was still this thing.The two of them were busy with each other, and the morning passed like this. After lunch, Shen Xuanqing was cutting bamboo outside the courtyard gate. The open space outside was large and spacious. He sat on the stool, thinking of the bamboo chicken, and turned to Lu Gu who had finished cleaning the kitchen. Said: \"Look at how the bamboo chicken was doing, and see if it has eaten the chopped chicken grass.\"Lu Gu went to the backyard to see, last night Shen Xuanqing applied herbs to the bamboo chicken's injured wings, at least let it live for a few days. It was festering and smelly, and he got some chicken grass when he got up early.Seeing that the chicken grass was less, the bamboo chicken cooed a few times when it saw people coming, and hid in the corner, Lu Gu knew that it was all right.\"the chicken grass was eaten, it will also make a sound.\" He went outside the courtyard and whispered to Shen Xuanqing, but he didn't leave after he finished speaking, and he seemed to have something to say.The courtyard faced the south, and the sun was very bright in front of the house. Sensing his hesitation, Shen Xuanqing looked up at him and asked, \"What's wrong?\"Lu Gu then said in a low voice: \"I, I want to boil water to wash my hair.\"It was not without reason that he was so timid. He would be scolded for using more firewood in the Lu family. Although the Shen family hadn't treated him badly, but be careful and told him what to do. Shen Xuanqing was working, but he was taking a bath.Shen Xuanqing paused before saying: \"Just boil it, enough water, enough firewood.\"Finally he said in a low voice: \"Just do whatever you want, you don't have to agree with me in everything.\"These words made Lu Gu Startled for a while, finally with eyes full of gratitude, he whispered again and again: \"Okay.\"The moon set and the sun rose, the cycle continued, and a few days passed in the blink of an eye.Lu Gu gradually got used to the life in the mountains. During the day, Shen Xuanqing took the dog out to hunt, he cooked and waited, and worked to weave bamboo cages in his free time. Taking advantage of the good weather these few days , he even unpacked, washed and dried the bedding.In the past two days, he had been picking wolfberry in the weeds outside. The grass in the mountains was tall and dirty, and he would inevitably bring dust with him when he came back.The embarrassment of that night made him learn to be a good boy. He boiled water to scrub during the day when Shen Xuanqing was away, and the sun was shining at noon, so he was not afraid of the cold after washing his hair.Shen Xuanqing scrubbed diligently so that he didn't dare to get dirty.Just after noon, the sky changed, dark clouds gathered, covering the sun, the sky was gray, Lu Gu was looking outside the door, not long after he heard a dog barking from a distance, he knew Shen Xuanqing was back.Fortunately, he came back early today, and it started to rain after dinner. The rain was heavy, pattering on the eaves and ground.Bamboo chickens were driven to the firewood house to shelter from the rain, and the rabbit cage was also inside. The goji berries had been harvested from the sun, and there was nothing to be drenched in the yard. Lu Gu had nothing to do, and sat in the main room before dark. Weaving bamboo baskets while listening to the rain, the room was not bright, and he was reluctant to light the oil lamp, so he could only sit here.As for Shen Xuanqing, he noticed the clean smell of wild bath beads on Lu Gu's body today, obviously after washing, he didn't want to get dirty in front of his fulang and lost face, so he boiled water and was taking a bath in the kitchen right now.After the head and body were all dry, the kitchen door opened. Lu Gu raised his head subconsciously when he heard the movement, and saw Shen Xuanqing running in from the rain with a few steps.He stopped what he was doing, murmured a few times and didn't know what to say, and he didn't dare to look into Shen Xuanqing's eyes, so he just lowered his head.Shen Xuanqing was not annoyed either, he left early and came back late these days, and he could only hold Lu Gu at night after he fell asleep, and he came back early today, allowing him to spend more time with Fulang, and it was too late to be happy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The three dogs also hid in the main room to avoid the rain, and found a dry place to lie down. With more people beside him, Lu Gu's hands in weaving bamboo baskets became more cautious, and he felt a little uncomfortable.Shen Xuanqing was stunned for a moment, feeling that it was not good to stand still, so he moved a bench and sat next to Lu Gu , and also picked up the bamboo strips and said in a low voice: \"I'll do it with you.\"\"Yes.\" Lu Gu couldn't say no, with lowered eyebrows, he complied.As long as the words were uttered, he slowly opened his mouth. Shen Xuanqing, who was a little bit at a loss just now, gave up and thought about something to say, and asked about Lu Gu's livelihood in the past few days.\"I see you dried a lot of goji berries.\"Hearing this, Lu Gu paused his hands, raised his eyes and said nervously, \"I heard people say that the medical center accepts it.\"Shen Xuanqing pondered for a moment, and said, \"That's right, not only doctors, if it was sold in the market and some people buy will buy it, but the price is not high.\u201dThey could see wild goji berries all over the mountains and plains, and it could be used as medicine, but because people often picked and sold it, it was not a scarce commodity, so the price hadn't changed.After speaking, he got up to look at the two bamboo plaques of wolfberries on the table. Lu Gu picked them up and they were all big. They were of better quality than those from Qianshan. Even if the price didn't go up, they were easier to sell.He grabbed a handful and took a closer look, then said to Lu Gu: \"I'll take you to sell it when I go down the mountain.\"wasn't that what he had been busy these days? It was a lot calmer than before, and he didn't feel so cramped when he didn't speak.A gust of wind blew, carrying the rain and rushing towards the two people in the main room.There was cold rain on Lu Gu's face and hands, he hurriedly moved the pile of bamboo strips on the ground to the back, he didn't add any clothes, he felt cold at the moment.After a little effort, there were more and darker clouds in the sky, let alone the main room, and it was not very bright outside, as if it was going to be night.Seeing that the wind was getting stronger, Shen Xuanqing put down the bamboo strips that he had just woven at the bottom, and said to Lu Gu, \"It's cold, let's go into the house.\"After saying that, he got up and closed the door of the main room to prevent the rain from blowing in.It was so dark, and the door was closed again, and there was no way to work, so Lu Gu had to follow him into a warmer room.The doors and windows in the room were closed, and the heavy rain outside could still be heard, even the wind was blowing violently. Fortunately, in the deep mountains and forests, they had such a strong house to withstand the wind and rain.Sitting at the table with nothing to do, and unable to see clearly, Shen Xuanqing paused and said, \"I'm tired these days, and the rain won't stop for a while, so why not lie down and rest for a while.\"This was indeed the truth, in the past, he had to cook in the mountains by himself in the evening, so he would come back earlier, but now that Lu Gu was with him, it saved him the trouble of cooking, and he came back later than before. He went out early and came back late for six consecutive days, and was busy in the mountains, so he should take advantage of the rain today to rest for a while, not only him, but Lu Gu also had to do a lot of things every day, so it would be good for his body to have a free time to lie down and rest.Sleeping on the same bed was a bit customary for Lu Gu, he opened his mouth after hearing this, but finally didn't dare to refuse, besides, if Shen Xuanqing went to sleep, he would just sit at the table and do nothing, it would be even more stupid. The new quilt was pulled out on the bed. He had washed the old quilt two days ago, and when it was too cold at night, he put the old quilt that had been washed on top of the new quilt, covering with two layers.Right now, he was no more sleepy than at night, Lu Gu was lying in bed thinking about something, Shen Xuanqing said to take him to sell things, then could he bring more, whether it was medlar or other medicinal materials, he had to look for it. The bed was gradually getting warmer, and the other person on the bed was also thinking about something.It was just that as the clean and soft breath from Lu Gu came over again, Shen Xuanqing forgot about the business.It was only been a few days, but he was used to sleep at night, and now he was lying down, with nothing in his arms, and the emptiness was getting bigger and bigger, like blackness swirling in his chest. When it got out of hand, it would swallow up reason.Lu Gu was just a little bit distracted, and suddenly he was caught by the hand leaning on Shen Xuanqing's side. He was shocked and immediately came back to his senses.Shen Xuanqing's hands were bigger than his and strong, even the palms were dry and warm, which made him a little frightened, not knowing what this meant.In the past few days when he woke up in the morning, he would always be hugged, but that was only after he had fallen asleep at night, how could it be like this in broad daylight now.Shame made Lu Gu moved his hand slightly, and the big hand holding him was even more forceful, clenched tightly, let him know that Shen Xuanqing didn't touch by mistake.He had to lie quietly and let his hands be held.Who knew that this was not the end yet, after a while of silence, the tall man beside him turned over and hugged him into his arms.Lu Gu's whole body was stiff, he didn't dare to move, he was flustered, he smelled the wild bath beads on Shen Xuanqing's body, as if he was warmed by the man's hot chest, he became quite aggressive, it reminded him of that day. The fear that he felt when he helped Shen Xuanqing wiped the medicinal wine.He seemed to hear a soft and satisfied sigh, but he was too nervous to tell if he heard it wrong.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He saw a few fallen leaves on the ground that had been beaten by the wind and rain, and there were still water marks. The leaves had turned yellow, which made him suddenly felt the feeling of autumn.Shen Xuanqing went out with a fish basket and net, saying that he was going to catch fish, shrimps and loaches by the river. Both of them got up late this morning, so he didn't 't go out to hunt, and he didn't see the sun until noon.Lu Gu was a little drowsy from the sun, and his mind became dazed, and it was at this moment that he realized that he really seemed to become a fulang last night.He was bought to be Shen Xuanqing's fulang. He didn't expect these things before, but now it had indeed happened. It seemed that this was what a real husband should be like. While he was afraid of shame, he also accepted his fate.So what if he didn't admit it, he didn't dare to move last night, he bit his lower lip in pain, and didn't say a word, he couldn't change his mind today and say no, besides, he didn't have the courage to tell Shen Xuanqing.He sat alone for a long time, and when he finally couldn't bear it anymore and wanted to go back to his room to sleep, the dog jumped over the threshold and rushed in from the outside, followed by Shen Xuanqing.His clothes were wet, but he didn't care, his rolled up sleeves were not put down, revealing his slender and strong forearms, his legs were long and his waist was slender and straight, when he saw Lu Gu at this moment, his face was full of spring smiles than the one on that day. In the sun it was eye-catching.Because of his drowsiness, Lu Gu raised his head and stared blankly, not avoiding his eyes for the first time, this look made him realize that Shen Xuanqing looked so, so handsome and heroic.The vague and cold outline became clear in his heart, and he seemed to suddenly realize that Shen Xuanqing looked like this.\"I used a dense net to carry two big fish. If they were trapped in the net, they will not die because there was river water. The edge of the net was under the blue stone. If you want to eat tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, you can go there and get it.\" Shen Xuanqing walked over a few steps , with long legs and a handsome figure, his posture was still straight, and even a bunt couldn't hide his posture. These few steps could be called high-spirited.He smiled more than usual, squatted halfway in front of Lu Gu, showed him the fish basket, and said with a smile: \"These loaches and miscellaneous fish are for you to make soup, and there are small shrimps. It rained yesterday, the river has risen, and the white-shelled shrimps in the mountain stream have been washed down. I caught a lot and boiled it in the water for you to eat.\"The small fish basket was heavy, and it could be seen that a lot had been caught. Seeing himself in his smiling eyes, he realized that he had been staring at him for a long time, and panicked, he quickly lowered his head and pretended to look at the fish basket. After what happened last night, being looked by his husband, Shen Xuanqing was no longer at a loss when facing Lu Gu as before.He half-squatted and half-kneeled in front of Lu Gu lightly on his left knee, the sun shone on Lu Gu's face, making it looked more radiant.Lu Gu's cheeks were not fleshy, but they were also soft, he knew it last night.The breath gradually approached, and the cheek was lightly rubbed by another person's lips. The fear from last night came again, and Lu Gu tightly grasped the fabric on his leg.After a while, Shen Xuanqing realized his gaffe, reluctantly backed away , and said in a hoarse voice, \"I'm going to kill the loach.\"\"Yeah.\" Lu Gu nodded with lowered eyebrows, the place where his cheek was rubbed was hot, and he couldn't lift it up at all.Shen Xuanqing got up and walked a few steps to the kitchen, then turned his head and said: \"If you are tired, why don't you sleep for a while, and I will call you when it's time to eat.\"Lu Gu answered okay and hid in the room.As for Shen Xuanqing, who cooked by himself, as long as it was not frying, he could handle it.At home, he had seen Wei Lanxiang stewed loach. After killing it, cut some ginger and spring onions and put them in a jar, added water and boil it in a small medicine stove. The water was just boiled, Lu Gu steamed some steamed cakes yesterday, just warmed up a few to serve.Lu Gu couldn't hear the movement outside after lying down for a long time, and fell into a deep sleep. It was not that he was not in good health, he was used to work and weeding grass on weekdays, and he could stand the toss. If he progressed step by step like an ordinary young couple, he wouldn't be so tired.It was just that Shen Xuanqing was too young, his tanned muscles seemed to have nowhere to exert his strength, and it was the first time that he was careless, he was a little reckless, he didn't want to let go of the taste of meat, and the world was turned upside down.There was a change in life, and this change stayed, and Lu Gu gradually got used to it every now and then.With more personal care, there had been some changes inside and outside the house. A few wild flowers were moved by Lugu in front of the courtyard gate. After watering, these few plants survived, and they bloomed big red or yellow flowers. Added some color to the front of the house.He saw that there were exquisite people in the village who could grow flowers. When he saw beautiful ones in the mountains, he even dug up the roots and brought them back.The breeze blew in the morning, and the flower branches sway gentlyLu Gu locked the door with the bamboo basket on his back, and after turning around, he went down the mountain with Shen Xuanqing who pulled up the cart. The cart was full of prey, and it was time to sell it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 47": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Sweet Little FulangCH 25.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe mountain road was rugged, and the journey was tiring and difficult, but the full load of prey filled the heart with enthusiasm, and the legs seemed to have endless strength.On the hillside behind the village, two small dogs barked and rushed home, just in time for Shen Yaoqing, who was carrying a hoe to go to the ground, to hear, and hurriedly looked over, seeing that Shen Xuanqing was pulling a cart that seemed heavy, he called out to the yard. He put down his hoe and hurried over to meet him. In the haste, he rubbed the dog's head twice, otherwise they would keep rubbing against his legs and wagging their tails.The three of Wei Lanxiang also rushed out when they heard the commotion. Seeing that Lu Gu and Shen Xuanqing were doing well, the worries in her heart went away. When they came down from the mountain, they were dressed clean and tidy, no longer looked like a bandit with a disheveled face, and they smiled more. Looking at it, it was called a spirited head.In this way, even if she died now, she would be worthy of Shen Shunfu when she went underground.\"Mother, sister-in-law.\" Lu Gu whispered to her and Ji Qiuyue.\"Hey, it's good to be back.\" Wei Lanxiang smiled happily, and unloaded the bamboo basket on his back with Shen Yan.\"Brother Guzi, can you give me one of your flowers?\" Shen Yan saw several mountain flowers on the bamboo basket. They couldn't name them. The petals rose from the bottom to the top, turning from pink to orange like clouds blooming in the evening sky, very beautiful, because there were several flowers, she couldn't help asking.Lu Gu saw this when he was resting on the road. He picked a few branches from a cluster and brought them. He took them out and said, \"It's for you.\"He saw Ji Qiuyue again and handed it to her, he whispered: \"Sister-in-law, there are for you and mother too.\"Wei Lanxiang laughed from ear to ear, and she handed the flowers back to Lu Gu, but Lu Gu shook his head and whispered no, so she gave it to Ji Qiuyue, Said: \"It's hard for you to be filial, it's because mother is old enough to wear flowers for what, and people will laugh at the old monster.\"The whole family talked and laughed, and pulled the cart back together.Shen Yan had beautiful flowers in her hair. Although she was young, she had a round face and lovely almond eyes, and wearing flowers made her even more cute.She was anxious on her feet, eager to go out and wanted to show off to girls of the same age, but the cart brought so many things back, which made her stumble, and after some struggles, she had a choice. First, let's see what Brother Erqing brought back. It was not too late to show off the flowers on your head.\"This is a black-hoofed sheep? Amitabha, it can be sold for a lot of money, and there are a lot of pheasants.\" Wei Lanxiang looked at the things on the cart, and saw each one muttering one by one, full of joy.When she knew that the dried goods in Lu Gu's bamboo basket were dried by himself, she got Shen Xuanqing's wink, and she was full of praise: \"Guzi picked so many goji berries and a lot of wormwood. It sells for a lot of money, and tomorrow, mother will get you some rice wine, and grab some goji berries to cook rice wine to drink.\"Lu Gu took good care of Shen Xuanqing, and he was so diligent, and she was not partial to her son's selfishness, the more she looked at Lu Gu, the more she felt God opened his eyes, thankfully she didn't marry that Lu Wen back, thinking about it, she clapped her hands and said: \"I won't wait until tomorrow, mother will go with your sister-in-law.\"Lu Gu bowed his head shyly after being praised , Before he even looked up, Wei Lanxiang went out to make rice wine with Ji Qiuyue, with a basket on her shoulders.Shen Yan also finished looking at the cart at this moment, pulled a few long colorful feathers from the buttocks of a dead pheasant, and said to Shen Xuanqing: \"Second brother, I'm going to play with Caixia and the others.\"He was happy to be back today, Shen Xuanqing didn't care about her playfulness and didn't let the ducks go, he took a small cloth bag for her, said: \"Share it with them.\"Shen Yan took it over and took a look, it contained Wild fruit, with a bigger smile on her face, she went out happily.The things on the cart were not unloaded, only three pheasants and two hares were taken down, and they were left for Wei Lanxiang and the others to eat, and the rest would be taken to the town tomorrow to sell.Lu Gu and Shen Xuanqing washed their faces and sat in the yard to rest, Shen Yaoqing also stopped going to the ground, took a bowl and sneaked into Wei Lanxiang's room, grabbed more than half a bowl of melon seeds, and sat under the eaves chatting cheerfully with his second brother.The melon seeds were bought two days ago, the fragrant roasted seeds and nuts, Wei Lanxiang was not willing to take out more, thinking that if someone came from the family, it would be honorable to serve this treat.Lu Gu had eaten melon seeds twice at such an age, and there were not many, so he could sit and nibble slowly at this moment.Someone in Qingxi village made rice wine, and Wei Lanxiang and Ji Qiuyue went to the tofu shop in the next village, planning to stew tofu with meat sauce. Tofu was not available in the mountains, so they would be rewarded when they came back.It was just that the family hadn't bought pork recently, so she inquired, and finally asked Mrs. Lin Jinhu from the village for half a cattie, and she would pay it back tomorrow.When she came back, she saw Lu Gu and Shen Xuanqing resting in the courtyard. She didn't let Lu Gu help her, and went to the kitchen with Ji Qiuyue to light a fire and cook. As for the melon seeds Shen Yaoqing stole, she glared at her eldest son. Knowing that he thought like a child.But she glared and laughed again. Speaking of which, she favored Shen Xuanqing more, but she was not bad for the eldest son. The palms and backs of the hands were full of meat, and they were nothing more than melon seeds.As for Shen Yan, the youngest daughter was not comparable to the two sons, she always took Shen Yan to the town when she was selling eggs and duck eggs, even if she didn't say anything, Ji Qiuyue knew that she took her daughter to the festival, Either bought a bowl of hot and sour bean curd or a shortbread.Of course Lu Gu didn't know, he just arrived after all.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The tofu was stewed until the tofu was brown. Let\u2019s have another soft white flour steamed bun. The white flour was finer and much tastier than mixed flour. This meal was very satisfying.There was constant chatter and laughter in the yard, everyone in the Shen family had smiles on their faces, Lu Gu didn't have to wash the dishes after eating, Ji Qiuyue asked him to go back to his room to rest, after walking all the way.This day passed happily, and the next morning, Lu Gu followed Shen Xuanqing to the morning market.The official road was flat, much easier to walk than the mountain road. The cart was pushed forward. Lu Gu was used to running in the mountains for the past ten days. Walking on such a flat road suddenly felt easy. After all, it was better to go down the mountain.He was carrying a big bamboo basket, there was goji berries and wormwood, he also picked a lot of wild bath beads, which were much cheaper than fragrant bath beads, even people in the town often used them, so someone would buy them.As for the dried mushrooms, he thought there were not enough of them. He heard people said that they were good to eat, and they could eat them when they cooked soup or stew in late autumn and winter. Except for the ones he kept in the mountains, they also brought some for home. If they found more mushrooms in the future, it wouldn't be too late to sell them.They got up early, and the flow of people coming and going increased after the morning set.Because he pushed the cart today, Shen Xuanqing brought two benches from home, so he could sit and rest his legs.Lu Gu's bamboo baskets were placed on the back of the cart, not occupying any other space, so he only had to pay a fee. He took out the bundle of mugwort leaves so that people could see them, and put the cloth bag containing the wild bath beads on the bamboo basket. Next to the basket, you could see it at glance.Shen Xuanqing yelled, he hesitated at the side, and when he saw the old lady passing by, he shouted: \"The bath beads are cheaper, five copper coins, wolfberries are also available, three copper coins.\"Because it was a dry product, three copper coins referred to a catty, which was the market price of goji berries. Last night, Wei Lanxiang went to the village to borrow a scales, so that he could use it when selling things, so he didn\u2019t have to go to the shop to borrow it from others. Yes, otherwise it depended on the face of others.\"Auntie, look at this bath bead. It's big enough to wash your hands for two days.\" Shen Xuanqing heard his voice, a smile flashed in his eyes, and he helped him talked to people.Seeing the woman looking over, he said again: \"The ones picked from the deep mountain forest are better, and you can keep the fragrance after washing your hair.\"Hearing this, even the two passing couples and women came forward. Yes, grabbed a handful, looked and smelled it.Shen Xuanqing didn't lie, the tree that Lu Gu found was really good, it was what they used in the mountains, and they could smell it after washing their hair.\"It doesn't smell as good as fragrant bath beads.\" A fulang picked it, and even glanced at the wolfberry in the bamboo basket, pinched two to taste.Shen Xuanqing was used to see it, and said gently: \"How can wild bath beads compare with fragrant bath beads, ours is cheaper, and it's already more fragrant than the other bath beads.\"\"So, I will buy six for six copper coins.\" Fulang Bargained with him.\"Fulang is just joking. The things are not expensive at all, and they are so good. My fulang walked on mountain roads for three hours for carrying them back. It's not cheap.\" Shen Xuanqing didn't agree.This thing was sold at a low price,\u00a0 a copper coin, and now one copper coin couldn't even buy a sesame seed cake, if the price was lowered, Lu Gu would be busy in the mountains these days for nothing.The fulang felt that he really wanted something, and seeing that Shen Xuanqing didn't let go, he said a lot in his mouth, and finally Shen Xuanqing said that if he bought six for twenty copper coins.Originally wanted to sell it for twenty copper coins, but when he heard that it was only fifteen copper coins, Shen Xuanqing became a little annoyed, and finally asked Lu Gu what he meant, as long as he bought it for fifteen copper coins, it would be six.It was Lu Gu's first time to sell things, he was nervous and didn't figure out how much he would give for fifteen copper coins, and he was quick to think, he memorized it silently, and counted it.When the Fulang left, he reached out to take two more, Shen Xuanqing pretended not to see it, this kind of person was quite common in business, and the most important thing was to make money with kindness, so there was no need to worry too much about it.As for Lu Gu, he also understood this truth, besides, he sold it for fifteen copper coins at once. Shen Xuanqing didn't pick up the money, the Fulang handed it to him.Fifteen copper coins were not light, and they were heavy in his hand, but he had no time to think about it, because there were two women who wanted to buy them, and they agreed with the Fulang to lower the price just now, and since there were six for fifteen copper coins, they both wanted it.After Lu Gu finished counting the wild bath beads and collected the money, together with the fifteen copper coins on the cart, there would be a total of forty-five copper coins.Farmers were very happy to earn forty-five copper at a stroke, let alone Lu Gu, who hadn't touched many copper coins, the most that passed through his hands was ten copper coins, when his mother was around.This large handful of copper coins seemed to him like a dream, but dreams would wake up, so he reluctantly gave the money to Shen Xuanqing.Shen Xuanqing was puzzled, frowned lightly and asked in doubt: \"What are you doing for me? Don't you bring a small cloth bag.\"Lu Gu thought that he was going to put everything in the cloth bag, and handed it in after the sale, so he hurriedly followed the order.While talking, someone came to see the wild things, so Shen Xuanqing had to stop talking, turned around and got busy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After the first payment, Lu Gu's shouting voice no longer trembled, at least he dared to talk to the woman and fulang when they passed by.\"Ma'am, look at the medlars, it's all good.\"Shen Xuanqing was selling prey at the side. Seeing that he dared to speak out after being busy, he was relieved and joyful in his heart, and the smile on his face became more obvious. Lu Gu was timid but not too much cowardly, he knew how to do what should be done, and it would definitely get better and better in the future.The gray-haired and elderly woman was carrying a basket, and she really leaned forward to look at it. She asked, \"How much?\"Lu Gu quickly said, \"Three copper coins.\"It was a habit of people to say that things were expensive at the beginning, and then it was easy to lower the price. The old woman was like this. No matter what she bought, she had to negotiate the price. She was used to it.Although Shen Xuanqing told him that three copper coins was the market price, and the goji berries he picked were big and good, which was already cheap, but Lu Gu had never done a small business before, and he was a little uncertain without someone's help, so he had to turn to look at Shen Xuanqing .\"Auntie, it's not expensive. It's cheaper than the little ones, which sell for three copper coins.\" Seeing him timidly looking over, Shen Xuanqing felt like being scratched in his heart, and opened his mouth without thinking.Lu Gu was very grateful, because there was such a \"reassuring pill\" standing beside him, he also followed suit: \"Ma'am, it's not expensive.\"The old woman often bought things, so she naturally knew the market price, and after picking things for a while, she saw that the price was lower.Lu Gu hurriedly took out the scales, he knew how to do it, and Wei Lanxiang taught him after borrowing it back last night.He got another six copper coins, and when Lu Gu put the money into the cloth bag, he heard the crash of the copper coins colliding, even though the money would be given to Shen Xuanqing later, but just listening to it made people happy, and he even smiled.After this time, if someone lowered the price when buying goji berries, Lu Gu would follow Shen Xuanqing's words and didn't need help.Compared with Shen Xuanqing's income, he had small money here. When there was no one around, he would watch Shen Xuanqing sold prey and did a favor or something.Today was a good day, the sun was getting bigger and hotter. Because there were quite a lot of wild animals, there were still a few that hadn't been sold out.Shen Xuanqing felt hot, and saw that the water in the bamboo tube had been drunk, and he was hungry, so he let Lu Gu to look at it, and went to buy food nearby.The busiest and noisy time of the morning market was over. There were not many people buying in the market, and many hawkers who had finished the morning market had left.Seeing that no one came to ask, Lu Gu just sat on the bench to rest. He had been standing almost all the time, and now he had time to sit down.He searched among the few people with his eyes, and soon found Shen Xuanqing's figure, after all, such a tall man was quite rare.Not long after, Shen Xuanqing came back with two bowls of noodles, and said casually: \"This Yangchun noodles is good, I have eaten it twice.\"Lu Gu took a bowl, he had heard that a bowl of noodles costs ten copper coins, Lu Wen often ate it when he was studying in the town. After returning to Anjia Village, he sometimes talked to Du Hehua about wanting to eat Yangchun noodles.The two sat on stools and put the bowl on the cart as a table.The noodles were thin and white, sprinkled with emerald green scallions, and the clear soup was embellished with soy sauce and bright yellow oil. It looked greasy, but the noodles were smooth and chewy. The soup was light and delicious. You could even finish the soup in one bowl. You were satisfied and comfortable, and you felt that it was worth ten copper coins.And when Shen Xuanqing returned the bowl, he also brought a bamboo tube of green plum wine. This wine had a very light brewing flavor and the taste was sweet and sour. It was often drunk by women and Shuang'er.Lu Gu originally thought that he brought the bamboo tube to ask for water, but he didn't expect that when the lid of the bamboo tube was opened, he could smell such a sweet and sour taste.\"Drink.\" Just as Shen Xuanqing finished speaking, someone came over and asked how to sell the pheasant.Lu Gu held the bamboo tube and carefully tasted it. The taste was sour and then sweet, and there was a slight taste of wine. This taste was strange to him. After two sips, he felt that it was delicious, and his eyes seemed to be brighter.After Shen Xuanqing sold two pheasants, he turned his head and saw his joyful expression, and he was also happy in his heart.The sun was getting higher and higher, so that people's eyes were hard to open.There were only two pheasants and the black-hoofed sheep that was still alive on the cart. Shen Xuanqing took another look at the goji berries in the bamboo basket. It was halfway down, but there were not many wild bath beads left. Many of bundles of solid mugwort leaves were also sold.\"Go to the medical clinic to see if they accept wolfberries, and then go to the pork shop and sell the sheep and you can go back.\" He said, tidy up the cart, put the benches on it, and since Lu Gu didn't need for the bamboo baskets, he put it on the cart and pushed it away.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 50": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Sweet Little FulangCH 26.2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter leaving the market, they handed over the wooden sign, and the two of them walked towards the east of the town, and they arrived at the medical clinic first. The people in the medical clinic looked at the quality of the goji berries, tasted them, and accepted them all at the market price of three copper coins. Well, at the end when the two of them were leaving, the man also said that if there was any more such goods, just came over, and they would accept as much as they sold.This undoubtedly surprised Lu Gu. Few people went to the deep mountains and forests. He was the only one who picked those wild goji berries by himself. He never thought that he would be lucky.Because it was dry goods, and he picked and dried them by himself, there were many goji berries in the mountains, but they were not everywhere. The rest in the bamboo basket weighed ten catties.There were too many copper coins and it was not easy to take them, so Shen Xuanqing asked the staff to replace all the copper coins for silver, and the five taels of silvers went into Lu Gu's hands.Not to mention the rest of copper coins in the cloth bag, Lu Gu held the broken silver tightly, his feet were a little erratic, and he stared at Shen Xuanqing in a daze when he left the clinic.\"What are you doing in a daze.\" Shen Xuanqing said with a smile.Lu Gu just woke up like a dream, and put the broken silver into his sleeves, so that even the inner pockets of his sleeves seemed to become precious and heavy.The pork shop was on another street. Shen Xuanqing met a butcher surnamed Zhao, and they finally agreed that the butcher Zhao would give Shen Xuanqing five taels of silver, and Shen Xuanqing would take away the slaughtered sheepskin and a hind leg.Compared with pork and chicken, mutton that was nourishing and could be stewed with medicinal materials was more expensive. When the price of pork was 20 copper coins per catty, mutton can be sold for copper coins when it was cheap, but sheep were not as fat and big as pigs, and the meat produced naturally not as many as pigs, and this black-hoofed sheep was a small sheep, so five taels of silver was considered fair, and Butcher Zhao made money himself.The two of them had always been on good terms with each other, so they made a plan, boiled a large pot of water, sharpened their knives and slaughtered the sheep in the courtyard.Shen Xuanqing was a hunter and knew how to skin the sheep. It was not difficult for him to kill pigs and sheep, and he wanted the sheep skin, so he handled it with the knife.Lu Gu and Mr. Zhao's wife, Ji Shi, were sitting in the shop. Ji Shi was holding their one-year-old fat boy with some drool.Ji Shi's body was slightly plump, she loved to talk and laugh, the child wouldn't let her sit, she had to stand up and move around, she gossipped with Lu Gu, it was mostly about their little tiger (the baby), and she also complainned about the difficulty of raising children.Listening to what she said, Lu Gu responded in a low voice from time to time, his eyes fell on the fat face of the little tiger, and the little tiger giggled at him, and he couldn't help laughing too.Seeing the wild bath beads in the bamboo basket on the ground next to the chair, Ji Shi asked, \"Did you buy these wild bath beads to use it, or to sell?\"Working in a butcher shop, it was inevitable that you would get greasy hands, so you had to wash your hands frequently. Although Zhao Butcher\u2019s family was rich and could afford the fragrant bath beads in the powder shop, it felt like a waste if you used these to wash your hands. So they often bought some wild bath beads back.Knowing that it was for sale, she wanted to buy it. It was bigger than the ones she bought earlier, and she could scrub and wash it in her hands many times.Lu Gu saw that there were only a dozen of wild bath beads left. Just now he heard Shen Xuanqing talking to Butcher Zhao, he was familiar with him, he thought for a while and said: \"Sister-in-law, you can just take it, you don't need to give me money.\"\"Hey, why are you like this? Say, it's not easy for you to pick it.\" Ji Shi smiled and gave a way.Lu Gu said again: \"There are only a few left, it's nothing.\"These ten were sold for three copper coins. He\u00a0 got a lot of copper coins today, not to mention the Ji Shi, if he went back and met people in the village,\u00a0 If they asked him, he would give it to them. This thing was picked in the mountains, and it didn't cost money, so it didn't matter if you gave up a few.\"If that's the case, then I'll accept your kindness. If you come to the town later, come and have a sit if you have nothing to do.\" The smile on Ji Shi's chubby face widened, and he helped Lu Gu refill the tea.The two chatted and laughed for a while, and teased the little tiger. After a while, because someone came to buy meat, Lu Gu help Ji Shi to hold the child. The little tiger was heavy, and after being held by him, his fat little hands were still stretched out. Pointing at Ji Shi who was cutting the meat, he was whimpering, as if talking to him.Six years ago, Du Hehua gave birth to Lu Wu. Lu Gu was about twelve years old at the time. Every time she ate, Du Hehua asked him to hug Lu Wu, she couldn't eat well by himself, so holding a baby was no stranger to him.But for Shen Xuanqing, he had never seen it before, his eyes paused slightly, and his expression seemed strange.Butcher Zhao came in from the yard with him, and went to weigh the meat for Ji Shi. After the work was done, Ji Shi took the children from Lu Gu, and Shen Xuanqing said goodbye to them. When he left, he originally wanted to buy a piece of meat, so he could pay back the half that he borrowed from the villager yesterday, and he could still ate some at home, but Zhao Butcher confiscated the money.After going out, Shen Xuanqing pushed the empty cart much more easily. On it was a bamboo basket, sheepskin and the sheep's legs. The sheep's legs were wrapped in sheepskin so that it was not exposed. When they got home, they stewed it with nourishing herbs.It was noon and the sun was very bright. Fortunately, it was autumn and it was not so hot. Lu Gu was thinking about the money he got today, maybe after he went back and gave the money, Shen Xuanqing could give him ten copper coins.But even if he didn't give it, he had nothing to complain about. He ate well and slept well at the Shen's house. Today Shen Xuanqing even bought green plum wine for him to drink, so that was enough.The two of them walked out of the town, and there were some people around an alley in front of them. It looked like they were joining in the fun, and they could vaguely hear crying and a few curses inside. When they got closer, they could piece together a rough idea from the gossip of those people.It turned out that there was a maid in the alley who was about to sell by the Zhang family. They said her hands and feet were not clean in the courtyard. The maid had an affair with the eldest son of the Zhang family who his wife died. She wanted to be his wife, so Mrs. Zhang would sell her out.It was impossible to know exactly what happened, but Lu Gu was a little surprised, it turned out that after buying someone, it could be sold again. He had been staying in Anjia Village, and he had been to the town a few times. He had only heard that there were people in the countryside who sold their sons and daughters. As for what happened after the sale, he didn't know.Looking at Shen Xuanqing again, there was a bit of fear in his eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He didn't think deeply when Wang Langzhong said the matter of giving birth that day. Just now, when he saw Lu Gu holding a child, his heart was suddenly touched. He had been thinking about it until now, so he only listened to what those people at the alley said, and didn't pay much attention to it.Although he didn't forget what he said about buying Lu Gu back then, he didn't take it to heart. What's more, he made an agreement with Wei Lanxiang at that time to let Lu Gu be his husband. It wasn't as a servant, and he usually didn't think about it at all.As for Lu Gu's look at him, because he often had such a timid expression, he didn't connect the things in the alley for a while, and said: \"If your legs are tired, sit and I will take you back.\"Lu Gu shook his head and said no, he wasn't tired, and he was far away from the alley, so he thought in his heart that at least he could eat in the Shen family. People were different, as long as he was obedient and worked hard to earn more money, he probably wouldn't be sold again.So he was a little relieved.After leaving the town, there was still a long way to Qingxi Village. Shen Xuanqing thought about his hard work all the way, so he let him get on the cart.Country people didn't have a carriage, so they often used the cart to carry people and loads. Some people who earned money by driving carts used donkeys or mules to hitch the cart, which was faster than people, and could run if the cart was light.Lu Gu sat on the cart, looking at the tall figure in front of him, he didn't know what to think, he felt that such a Shen Xuanqing wouldn't\u00a0 sell him.Both the cart and the bamboo basket were empty when they came back, Shen Xuanqing directly pulled Lu Gu into the yard before stopping.Wei Lanxiang, who was sitting under the eaves and working, greeted them. Beside her was a woman who Lu Gu had never seen before. She was about the same age as her. When Shen Xuanqing called her aunt, Lu Gu got out of the cart and he also called in a low voice.\"Come back so late, are you hungry?\" Wei Lanxiang helped Lu Gu took down the bamboo basket, and asked them with a smile.\"Mother, we have already eaten at noon, so we don't need to eat anymore.\" Shen Xuanqing picked up the sheepskin, without revealing the legs inside, and carried it into the kitchen.\"Erqing sold a lot today. I heard people say that you got up early and pulled a cart full of things to go to town.\" Zhou Yunzhi, the auntie said with a smile.When the voice came, his heart skipped a beat. Not all people with a sharp voice were bad guys, what caught Lu Gu's attention was the way Zhou Yunzhi looked in her eyes when she spoke, there was nothing wrong with it, but it reminded him of Du Hehua.Shen Xuanqing came out of the kitchen, heard her say this and replied: \"Auntie is joking, they are all worthless things, they just look like a lot. \"\"It's cheap but there's a lot of them, so you've made a lot of money.\" Zhou Yunzhi smacked her lips, with obvious disbelief on her face.\"No matter how much I sell, all I earn is a small amount of money. How can like the big brother who earns a lot of money every month doing errands in the town.\" Shen Xuanqing didn't want to continue talking to her, so he dragged the conversation aside.Zhou Yunzhi smiled proudly.Wei Lanxiang's expression remained unchanged, she pulled out a handful of green onions from the vegetable patch, and asked with a smile: \"Sister-in-law, do you have enough of these green onions?\"After talking about Shen Xuanqing, she came over to take a look. After looking at it, she looked at the cart without any wild things and there was nothing left, so she took the green onion and left.She didn't know that Shen Xuanqing had already left some food for the family, and he put them in the backyard.After she left, Wei Lanxiang still looked out the door, and then dragged Lu Gu back to the main room, and said in a low voice, \"This is your first uncle's wife, her name is Zhou Yunzhi, and everyone in the village calls her sister-in-law Zhou. Don\u2019t talk to her.\u201d\u201cAnd those from Dafang\u2019s (first family, from the the eldest son) family, I\u2019ll tell you later, keep in touch with your third uncle and aunt, and be careful with them (dafang), hid if you run into them, don\u2019t tell them about the family affairs, if you hear something unpleasant, just ignore it, tell me when you come back, and Erqing.\u201dLu Gu didn\u2019t like Zhou Yunzhi\u2019s counting eyes when she spoke, which reminded him of Du Hehua, upon hearing this, quickly nodded and said to write it down.After Zhou Yunzhi left, Shen Xuanqing went into the kitchen to chop the legs of sheep. Wei Lanxiang heard the movement, and hurriedly told Lu Gu to go to the kitchen. Seeing that it was legs of sheep, she couldn't be unhappy.Shen Xuanqing also gave her ten taels of silver, and made her smiled, and she even liked Lu Gu more and more.The debts owed by the family were all paid off, and all the money they earned belonged to themselves. After Wei Lanxiang hid the money, she called Lu Gu into the room and showed him the clothes she had made.she was so happy they came back yesterday, thinking that Lu Gu was too tired from walking the mountain road, and she still had a cuff confiscated, so she didn't mention the clothes, and took them out after finishing them today.The money for making clothes for Lu Gu was paid by Shen Xuanqing, this time she didn't take any money out, and when she bought cotton, she paid 80 copper coins cash for it herself, and made two thick jackets for Lu Gu, including tops and trousers. Saved your legs from freezing in the mountains.In addition to the jacket, there were three thick cloth clothes and a pair of cotton-padded shoes. These were all real materials. She couldn't do it by herself, so she asked Ji Qiuyue to help.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The new shoes fit snugly. There was a thin layer of cotton on the upper and inside of the shoes, which was very warm and soft to step on. He seemed to be stepping on a cloud, and the earth was soft.Not to mention wearing it in the mountains in late autumn, such shoes were enough in winter.In previous winters, he didn't have thick shoes and cotton clothes to wear, so he shivered and had frostbite on his hands and feet every year.He knew that it was Shen Xuanqing's money, but Wei Lanxiang was the one who made the clothes, so his gratitude to the Shen family poured out again. There was so much gratitude that he didn't know what to say.It was Wei Lanxiang who saw him holding the shoes with wet eyes after taking off his cotton shoes, smiled and folded the new clothes, put them all into his arms, and said, \"From now on, as long as you and Erqing live a good life, If you are harmonious and beautiful, our family life will be better, we have what we want to wear and eat, and we will not be hungry or cold.\"Lu Gu nodded heavily holding so many clothes and shoes, and there seemed to be something in his throat choking, unable to speak, he could only hum, with a muffled nasal sound.After dinner, when Shen Yaoqing from the field came back, they ate a pot of stewed mutton, which was more nourishing with some medicinal herbs. Because it was hot, everyone's face was rosy after eating, and they seemed to have more strength.Gradually at night, the dogs took up a place in the yard to gnaw on their bones. There was no one in the yard, so they all washed up and went back to the house to rest. The days were getting better and better,\u00a0 and they slept in a dream with a smile on their face.In Shen Xuanqing's room, a candle was lit, the doors and windows were closed, and the two of them sat at the table and counted the money.Lu Gu put the small cloth bag on the table, and took out five pieces of silver from his sleeve pocket and put it on the small pile of copper coins. He no longer thought about Shen Xuanqing giving him the copper coins, and pushed them all over.Shen Xuanqing was lowering his head to count the money, when suddenly these things appeared in front of his eyes, he subconsciously raised his head to look at Lu Gu, wondering, \"What's wrong?\"Lu Gu didn't understand, and whispered, \"The money is all inside.\"\"Give it to me?\" Only then did Shen Xuanqing understand, but this was Lu Gu's own hard-earned money, how could he want it, so he pushed it back, saying: \"Just keep it for yourself, and you have money in your hand for whatever you want to buy.\"He said and put an ingot of five taels of silver into Lu Gu's hands, and said again: \"Ask me if it's not enough, and you won't be short money.\"The money was collected. Blowing the light out, the room was plunged into darkness, not long after Shen Xuanqing came up, he rolled over and hugged Lu Gu.He was just happy today, except for the ten taels for Wei Lanxiang, what he kept and what he earned before made a total of twenty-nine taels. Moved and slowly accumulated wealth for yourself.The remaining five taels were given to Lu Gu, and he kept more than four taels for himself, and there were more than two hundred copper coins that were not included in the scattered silver, which could be spent on weekdays, and these were enough for a long time time to spend.And this time he gave his mother a lot of money, so he didn\u2019t need to give it again when he came back next time. The meat in the house was basically his prey, and the vegetables were grown by themself, so they didn\u2019t need to spend much money to buy it. It was either he or Shen Yaoqing, Wei Lan Xiang could also save some money in her hands, kept some money for herself, and decided what she wanted to buy.The night was getting darker, people were living with enthusiasm to move forward, and the days were also rushing forward, which was the best thing in the world.In the evening, when the farmers returned home, the village was full of smoke, and it was peaceful.Shen Xuanqing took a pheasant out in the afternoon, saying that he was going to have a few drinks with the village chief Chen and the others, but Lu Gu watched him went out without saying anything.After the meal, he and Wei Lanxiang went to Aunt Gu's house to buy cloth and colorful embroidery threads. This was the first time he said he wanted to buy something, and Wei Lanxiang agreed and came with him.Now that he had money in hand, Lu Gu picked better cloth and colored threads.\"What did you buy these for?\" Wei Lanxiang asked him casually on the way back.Lu Gu hesitated, and said in a low voice: \"I think Erqing's purse is old, so I'll make him a new one. I also want to make some sachets, so that my family can wear them even if I don't sell them.\"Erqing, he followed suit, but he had never yelled like this in front of Shen Xuanqing. Seeing that the purse Shen Xuanqing was using was old last night, he thought about it for a long time in the morning. Although he was still easy, he still wanted to help made one. It was always right to do more things.When Wei Lanxiang heard it, he was relieved and sighed that he was sensible, and asked in surprise that he could embroider sachets.\"My mother taught me, but I didn't do it so well.\" He said honestly, fearing that he didn't make it clear, he added: \"My mother.\"Mentioning this, Wei Lanxiang's eyes became more stressed, it was pitiful to see that his mother was gone, and he suffered such a big crime at the hands of the black heart. She had a son and a daughter. Just thinking about this kind of thing made her eyes sour. A child who lost his mother early had to suffer so much.She was afraid of making Lu Gu sad, so she said with a smile: \"Okay, when it's ready, you will give one to\u00a0 mother, she will wear it wherever she goes, and show it to others, our Guzi is good.\"\"Yes.\" Lu Gu nodded, Wei Lanxiang was kind to him, not only Wei Lanxiang, but also the rest of the Shen family, so it was nothing to make a few sachets, he still had to work hard to repay the Shen family.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He sat under the eaves and embroidered a money bag, which was bigger than a purse, so that he could hold a lot of copper coins and loose silver in the arms or sleeves.Even Ji Qiuyue came over to take a look, and finally said with a smile: \"The craftsmanship of Guzi was really good, much more refined than those sold outside.\"Let Lu Gu lower his head shyly.\"Come on tomorrow let Shen Yan also learn to do some needlework, so that you don't have to run around all day long, and you will be able to embroider flowers on clothes in the future.\" Wei Lanxiang smacked her mouth.In the past two years, the family was busy planing food and earning money, and Shen Yan had to work with the adults, and only occasionally taught him how to do needlework a few times. Seeing that Lu Gu was doing so well, she thought that Shen Yan should also learn from him. Yes, as for the work of releasing ducks and weeding grass, it was enough to do it once a day. When she had free time, she would follow her and gather more chicken grass and duck grass to feed.\"Yes, it's always right to know more.\" Ji Qiuyue echoed, most of the country people ate and made clothes by themselves, which was cheaper and more practical than the things bought there.While talking, someone walked in from outside the door, and it was Zhou Yunzhi.She smiled all over her face, and when she saw Wei Lanxiang, she said, \"Second sister in law, she's sewing clothes\"Lu Gu also greeted her.\"It's not like getting up early and eating too much, going out for a walk, and then coming here.\" Zhou Yunzhi said, and looked at the things Lu Gu was embroidering, and said, \"Oh, you can embroider lions, what a skill!\u201d\"Sister-in-law, are you free now?\" Wei Lanxiang put down the work in his hand and asked with a smile.Lu Gu lowered his head in embarrassment, and said in a low voice: \"No, no, just do it casually.\"Seeing that he was embarrassed, Wei Lanxiang grabbed the words and said, \"He is shy, he hasn't seen many people here, he is going to go up the mountain with Erqing again in the morning.\u201dShe asked again: \u201cI saw that sister-in-law and brother went to town? It looks like you two from a distance.\u201dZhou Yunzhi pursed her lips and smiled, with a reproachful tone, she said: \"My son Yutao sent someone a message to insist that I go live with him in the town. Look at the eldest grandson.\"She paused, the smile on her face didn't diminish, and she said: \"The strange thing is that people say that things in the town are expensive, so I had to go to the tavern to eat and drink at noon yesterday. I ordered a plate of Hongqiao, it\u2019s so expensive! Then a small stack would cost fifty copper coins, I can\u2019t eat spicy food, I ordered something fried with autumn peppers and boiled soybeans, it\u2019s even more expensive, seventy copper coins!\u201d She stretched out her hands and gestured with seven fingers, her eyes widened as if she was frightened, and she wanted to scare others with this price.How could Wei Lanxiang not know that she was showing off, and said with a smile: \"Sister-in-law, the son you gave birth to is good. Yutao is capable and filial. You said, this Hongqiao is really so delicious?\"Hongqiao was a kind of snail meat from green snails with thin shells . It could only be found in mountain streams in autumn. It was expensive. After looking at it in the mountains, soaked the green snails in the wine jar. After ten days, the shells would turn into powdery debris and sank to the bottom of the wine jar, while the red snail meat floated on top. The vegetables were fried together, delicious and fragrant, and the pickled vegetables were also crunchy and salty.As for stir-frying with autumn hot peppers and boiled soybeans, it was the most popular among men who drink, and it went better with wine than peanuts. Took the effort to go up the mountain to look for it yourself, otherwise you would be reluctant to eat it. Even ordinary people in the town only ate it once in a while when they had money.This Hongqiao was originally called Hongxiao or Xiaohong. It got its name because the snail shell disappeared and only the red snail meat was left.Zhou Yunzhi liked the flattery of others the most, and her chin was raised a little higher than before. Hearing the words, she said, \"That's right, it's so expensive and so little, it's really like eating gold.\"Wei Lanxiang didn't mend, looked at her and smiled, she said: \"Then if I go to the town some other day, if Yutao is here, I can tell him not to treat his second aunt badly. Let's get a taste of Hongqiao.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Not even the two of us dared to stay longer, I came back after dark last night. I don\u2019t let you go, I'm afraid that he won't be home if you go. It\u2019s not a waste of time?. We\u2019re so far away from the town.\"She couldn't stay any longer, she was afraid that the Erfang (second family from the second son) would eat and drink from their house, so she got up after a while and said, \"It's getting late now, your elder brother is in the field, I'll bring him some water.\"\"Then Sister-in-law, I won't keep you.\" Wei Lanxiang put down her things and sent her out, Lu Gu and Ji Qiuyue also got up.Zhou Yunzhi's legs were obviously faster than when she came here. After she was out of sight, Wei Lanxiang said: \"This dog looks down on people, and I can be rare for her things?.\"Shen Shunde was the eldest, Shen Shunfu was the second child, Shen Shunwang was the third child, and the three brothers had separated in the early years. After Shen Xuanqing's grandpa was gone, the second and third child didn't often go to the old family.After Shen Shunfu left, Erfang of Shen's family was poor, and Shen Shunde's family was rich, but the whole family was snobbish who disliked the poor and loved the rich. When they met in the village, even if Erfang family talked to them, they would just snort and\u00a0 ignore it, borrowed something from Erfang's house once in a while, that was how to show a good face.After they paid off their debts and married Shen Xuanqing, and let the villagers know that their family was rich, Dafang talked to them again.Wei Lanxiang was about to die of embarrassment, if Zhou Yunzhi hadn't come to help when Shen Xuanqing got married, and also followed the village custom, bringing eggs and white flour, although there were not as many as others, but the face was still passable, otherwise how could she went along today? She said those few words, of course, the following words were purely to drive Zhou Yunzhi away, otherwise she would have to show off.Ji Qiuyue said to her: \"Mom, we don't need to get angry with her, just keep our contacts less.\"Wei Lanxiang nodded, she wasn't angry either, she had been angry two years ago, and now it was not worth getting angry and making noise, so she laughed again: \"When the new rice is harvested, we'll be happy, and we'll go to a restaurant in town too , what kind of sauced beef and duck feet, you guys can eat whatever you want.\"Ji Qiuyue said quickly after hearing this: \"Mother, you said this, I have written it all down.\" \"\"I said it \" Wei Lanxiang smiled and gouged her out, afraid that she wouldn't count?Although she hadn't tasted it yet, just talking about it was enough to make people extremely happy. Ji Qiuyue also said to Lu Gu: \"Guzi, remember to be polite when the time comes. Mother will pay the bill. You can eat whatever you want.\"Lu Gu also had a slight smile on his face, he didn't speak, and nodded habitually.While joking, Shen Yan came back with bundles of chicken hay, and seeing them so happy, she asked out of curiosity, but Ji Qiuyue didn't hide it from her, and Shen Yan's almond eyes widened after she finished speaking, and she kept calling mother , causing Wei Lanxiang to poke her on the forehead.For a while, the courtyard was lively, which made Lu Gu, who didn't talk much, felt happy.In the afternoon, Shen Xuanqing, who had been out for a long time, came back with a bamboo basket on his back. He went out in the morning and didn't even come back for lunch. When he went out, he only said to buy something, and Lu Gu didn't dare to ask more questions.Seeing Shen Xuanqing coming back, he put down the embroidery work in his hand and went to him, helped Shen Xuanqing unloaded the bamboo basket. The bamboo basket was covered with a lid, and through the exposed gap, he seemed to hear the soft chirping.He put the bamboo basket on the ground, Shen Xuanqing stretched out his hand to open the lid, there was a smile on his handsome face, and said: \"I bought a few autumn chicks, and I will bring them to the mountain tomorrow for you to raise.\"Lu Gu saw the little chickens and ducklings inside raised their heads and squeaked, the sounds were delicate and tender.Unlike rabbits and pheasants, they often raised chickens and ducks here. chickens eggs and duck eggs were precious, and they could be sold for money. For example, in the Shen family, the chickens and ducks belong to Wei Lanxiang, she had the final say on whether the eggs were sold or not, and the money for the sale was spent by her and Shen Yan, and no one else could see it.It was the same when he was in Lu's house, the chickens belonged to Du Hehua, even if Lu Gu who threshed the grass, it was not his turn to take care of the eggs.This was a symbol of status in the family, but Lu Gu didn't understand this, he only knew that if these chickens and ducks were really in his care, then he was really in this family, just like the rest of the Shen family.Shen Xuanqing saw that he was squatting in front of the bamboo basket without speaking for a long time, so he said: \"After going up the mountain, I will surround the fence in the backyard, and then I will dig a small pond by the river, bring the water in, and put the ducks in it.\"\"that part of the river is gentle, and the ducks can swim in the river when they grow up.\" He said, and saw Lu Gu reached into the bamboo basket, carefully touching the chicks and ducklings inside.\"It's just that autumn chickens were not easy to raise as spring chickens, so be more careful when it was cold at night.\" Shen Xuanqing said again.The little soft chickens and ducklings brought Lu Gu back to his senses, he no longer panicked, raised his head and asked cautiously: \"For me?\"Hearing this, Shen Xuanqing nodded subconsciously: \"For you.\"Only then did he have a sense of reality, and joy surged up. Shen Xuanqing said that it was for him, and felt more and more that the chickens and ducks were fluffy, and he couldn't put it down.\"When I got up early and left, I heard people said that the next village was going to kill pigs. I went to buy some meat to take to the mountain.\" Shen Xuanqing asked him by the way: \"Do you want to buy anything? I haven't left today, so prepare it early.\"Lu Gu shifted his attention from the chickens and ducks, raised his head and thought for a while, and then whispered: \"I want to buy a small jar of wine.\"Shen Xuanqing was surprised, he didn't expect that such a cowardly fulang wanted to buy wine, but after thinking about something else, he put his fist on his lips and pretended to cough to cover it up. He nodded and agreed as if he hadn't thought about anything , didn't even ask Lu Gu what he was going to do to buy wine.Shen Xuanqing didn't stop when he wanted to buy something, the bamboo basket Shen Yan used to use was in front of him, and he went out with Lu Gu with bamboo basket on his back.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In addition, the bamboo chickens laid eggs that day, which made him felt that if he raised chickens in the mountains to lay eggs, There was no need to bring eggs from home every time.The mountain road was far away, and the eggs had to be carefully guarded. It would be a pity if they were broken. He used to run alone in the mountains and forests and couldn't serve the chickens and ducks. Now it was different with Lu Gu.There were chickens and ducks cooing and quacking in the yard, it would be more lively, and it wouldn\u2019t be deep and lonely. Besides, he himself loved to eat eggs. Although the autumn chicks wouldn\u2019t lay eggs until the beginning of next spring, it was better to buy them early and raisd them. Next year, they could eat it earlier, and when they got tired of eating fish and poultry in the mountains, they could also feed Lu Gu a bowl of custard.Today when he went to the market in the town, Shen Xuanqing not only looked for chickens and ducks, but also looked at the puppies, but because he wanted a mastiff with a good appearance, he couldn't pick one for a long time. he had no choice but to come back and ask Shen Yaoqing and other people in the village to help inquired about where there is mastiff puppies for sale. It was best to be like Dahui, which was more humane and more powerful than ordinary dogs. Take it to the mountains so you could also rest assured.He also wanted to buy a dog for Lu Gu since Dahui went to hunt with him. If he only caught rabbits, he would let Dahui stay with Lu Gu. If he gave Lu Gu a dog, he wouldn't worry too much after he left.The village next door was not too far away, and Meng Dayue would greet people from several nearby villages every time before slaughtering a pig, so there were quite a lot of people on the way to the village next door.Meng Dayue didn't kill pigs every day. If it was short, every six days, if it was long, he killed pigs once in a half months. Because he was close to here, he didn't need to go to the town to buy them. People in several villages only needed to hear that he slaughtered pigs and they would buy some meat.When Lu Gu and Shen Xuanqing arrived, the two pieces of pork had just been pierced with iron hooks, and they were picked up and hung on the wooden frame.There were quite a few people who bought it. Because Shen Xuanqing wanted more meat, he cut it first. Meat with fat was expensive. He asked for ten catties, another five catties of hind leg meat, and two big bones.He knew more or less people in the nearby villages. When they saw him bought so much, they asked whether he got rich or had a happy event at home. Shen Xuanqing smiled and dealt with it casually, saying that he would save some for the family and take it to the mountain.They all knew that he could hunt and usually went to the mountains, so he should buy more.After paid the money and have a chat with Meng Dayue, Shen Xuanqing picked up the bamboo basket and left with Lu Gu.\u00a0If you wanted to buy wine, there were wine brewers in Qingxi Village, so you didn't have to go far, just picked it up on the way back.On the way home, Shen Xuanqing bought two jars of wine, a small jar of two and a half catties of rice wine.\u00a0The two of them were more inconvenient in the mountains than in the village. If they wanted to drink rice wine, they had to come back and bring a jar.This trip alone cost a lot of money, and the bamboo basket was heavy. Fortunately, Shen Xuanqing was strong enough, so he didn't need Lu Gu to help him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He also heard that Shen Xuanqing drank a lot of wine when he got married, so he knew that he could drink it. Although eating meat in the mountains was not so bitter, but Shen Xuanqing should be happier with a refreshing appetizer.Even if you didn't drink, Hongqiao was so expensive in the town, it was good for Shen Xuanqing to try it out, it didn't cost him to cook it himself.Shen Xuanqing was happy that his fulang was thinking about himself, and assured Lu Gu: \"Eat, definitely eat, I don't drink too much wine, three or two glasses are enough, and I won't get drunk. \"Wei Lanxiang often told him to drink less alcohol, and didn't imitate the drunk man to do things that lost his reputation. He had educated himself, and his rationality was a bit more than that of a reckless man who hadn\u2019t educated. He also knew that alcohol could hurt the body, It was easy to make mistakes if you drank too much.No matter which man in the village went back drunk, if his body reeks of alcohol, his wife and fulang would felt disgust when they saw it. Even if a man vomitted all over, no one wanted to approach him, so he always rememberred not to drink too much, and in the past year, when he drank with others he rarely got drunk, firstly, he could really drink, and secondly, he wouldn\u2019t pour too much alcohol into his death, and mostly he drank until he had finished.Seeing the smile on Shen Xuanqing's face, Lu Gu was relieved, it seemed that he had done nothing wrong, and he nodded in agreement after hearing it, indicating that he understood.When the two of them went back, Wei Lanxiang was delighted to see her son smiling so much, and she kept looking at Lu Gu's face, so she knew they were getting along well, so there was nothing to worry about.Not long after the cock crowed ,Qingxi Village gradually began to have human voices.Lu Gu and Shen Xuanqing got up and had breakfast, then pushed the cart into the mountain again.This time they didn't go at night, and they could see the road under their feet more steadily. When Lu Gu reached the slope and turned his head, he saw Wei Lanxiang who was still standing at the door.He felt stuffy in his heart, with an unspeakable sour feeling, but he also felt that it was warm, but he couldn't say it. He walked forward with his head down, and lost his mind when he thought about it. If his mother was still there, he definitely would send him the same way.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although it was not as exquisite as the people in the town who carved flowers and birds, it was new anyway. It was only used by Shen Xuanqing and the new fulang, which was enough to see that the Shen family spent a lot of money and great effort on this marriage.But after arriving at Shen's house, neither Lu Gu nor Shen Xuanqing had ever used the bathtub. It was summer a while ago, just boiled some water for scrubbing. What's more, taking a bath with a bathtub required boiling a large pot of water. It was convenient to fetch water, but burning firewood like this was also costly, and firewood was not obtained out of thin air, and you had to go up the mountain to cut it. Except before the New Year's Day, how could the country people be willing to take such a big bath.Shen Xuanqing was scrubbing on the mountain a few days ago. It was colder in the mountain than outside the mountain at night. He was fine. If it went on, when even he couldn't stand it, Lu Gu would be let alone, so he moved the bathtub, if no one used it at home, it would also accumulate dust.In the kitchen, Lu Gu was busy cooking rice wine, which was faster than cooking rice porridge. Put some goji berries and boiled them. Shen Xuanqing moved things down, and when the meal was ready, he even swept the fallen leaves in the yard.It was past noon, and because their legs were tired from the journey, the two of them lay down on the bed to rest after eating, and took a nap for a while.Lu Gu was used to be hugged while sleeping, but Shen Xuanqing was too tall, with a hard chest, long legs and long arms, so he felt coerced and frighted when he used a little strength.Being able to eat enough and hugged his fulang who was comfortable, Shen Xuanqing slept peacefully for a while, and when he woke up, his spirit returned, and his eyes were radiant.He originally wanted to get up and go to work, but the little fulang in his arms made it hard for him to let go.\u00a0He hadn't shared the same bed for several days, his Adam's apple rolled, and he couldn't help rubbing against Lu Gu's cheek.\u00a0Lu Gu was lying on the bottom, his eyes were flustered, but he tried his best not to move, because outsiders would have no way of knowing what was going on under the quilt.Fortunately, it was broad daylight, and Shen Xuanqing didn't really do it. After a while, he got up and said in a low hoarse voice that he was going to make the fence in the backyard.Lu Gu's face was red and his ears were red, he clenched his underwear and sat up slowly.When that kind of thing happened at night, Shen Xuanqing was always different from usual, which made him even more fearful, he didn\u2019t dare even to say a word, his heart was trembling, his throat seemed to be choked, he clenched his lips tightly and didn\u2019t dare to say anything. He didn't dare to curl up his body even if there was no sound, and spread out his limbs and remained motionless.If you put it on someone who understood people and understood fun, he was undoubtedly jerky and boring, but Shen Xuanqing was the same as him. How could he understand these things? With experience, he couldn't do those things for now, and right now, it was enough for him.The mountain wind blew through the hall, blowing away the heat and embarrassment, Lu Gu took a while to feel at ease.There was still a pile of dried bamboo and wooden sticks in the firewood room. Shen Xuanqing carried them directly to the backyard, cut them open, and surrounded two places against the wall.They mostly hatced the chickens and ducks in spring, and there were very few autumn chickens, so he spent a lot of effort when he went to the market that day to find them, but he didn't buy many, seven ducks and eight chickens, and the chicken coop and the duck coop didn't have to be too big.When he was working, Lu Gu was boiling water in the kitchen. After boiling, he brought a bowl and put it aside to let it cooler, and then helped Shen Xuanqing inserted the bamboo poles and sticks into the ground.\"Let the chickens out during the day, and they will look for food outside. The ducks can also enter the water. They can eat grass on the ground or fish, shrimp, and earthworms in the water. If you don't want to let them out, just grab some bran. They can be eaten after being soaked in water.\"Shen Xuanqing explained to Lu Gu, he thought for a while and then said: \"It is better to fence the outside and enclose a large area, so as not to prevent the chickens from running far in the woods and encountering \u00a0something a little bigger and get taken away.\"Hearing this, Lu Gu nodded quickly and said, \"I'll follow you.\"These were the chickens and ducks raised for him, and they were precious in his heart, and he must not let the things in the mountains took them away.After the fence was completed, Lu Gu drove the chicks and ducklings that were locked in the firewood house over, and put them into the fence separately.The chickens and ducklings made childish calls, which made him a little reluctant to leave. He squatted down and touched the chickens\u2019 head, and the chickens twittered and chirped, and surrounded him.When he looked up at the duck pen, Shen Xuanqing leveled the ground with a shovel inside, and when he was walking out, the ducklings lined up and followed behind him, step by step, as if following a mother duck.Ducklings were like this, if you put them in the water, they were much more attractive than chickens, Lu Gu smiled.Shen Xuanqing blocked the ducklings inside and closed the fence gate, and when he turned her head, he saw a smile on his face.At this time, the autumn air was refreshing, Lu Gu's face was a little rosy under the sun, his skin was no longer as white and bloodless as before, it had become radiant, and the red marks between his brows were as beautiful as flowers, but he was still thin.It would be better to be fatter, Shen Xuanqing couldn't help thinking this way, but he didn't say anything, even if he said it now, he wouldn't get fat immediately.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Lu Gu used the soft hay to make nests for chickens and ducklings. He even put the pair of rabbits in the bamboo cage in the backyard. He stuffed a lot of grass into the cage when he was walking two days ago. He came back today and saw that they ate them all, and they didn\u2019t starve to death. Lu Gu plucked some of them before cooking.Unlike chickens and ducks, wild rabbits could dig holes, and they were not slow to dig the soil so it was better to use a cage.Before evening, Shen Xuanqing carried a shovel and a long hoe, and Lu Gu went with him to the river with a smaller hoe. They picked a suitable location and dug a hole for a pond for the ducks to swim, the river in the mountain was long, if they went down the river, Lu Gu couldn't find them.When he was in Qingxi Village, because there were a lot of ducks in the village, he was afraid of the ducks being caught if he traveled far away, and he was afraid of mixing with other people's ducks. If he met someone who liked to take advantage, it would take a lot of effort to get the ducks back, so Shen Yan often released the ducks in the pond. If she was free and didn't need to hunt chicken grass, she only watched the ducks swam in the river for a while.Shen Xuanqing used a shovel to draw a square of two feet. This pond was really not small. They only had seven ducks, enough to flop in it.Digging a pit was a laborious job, and it would definitely take a lot of work to dig it deep. Even if Lu Gu bent down and swung a hoe, he couldn't finish digging today.There were many rocks in the mountains. Fortunately, the old Orion chose a good place. There was a lot of soil beside the river and the forest. When they were digging, they rarely encountered rocks.When the sun sank to the west, Lu Gu went back to cook first, and Shen Xuanqing rolled up his sleeves and continued to work. Whether it was a hoe or a shovel, it seemed powerful in his hands. The muscles on his arms seemed to be cast in copper during his actions, and his physique was strong. He was much stronger than ordinary men, and he was not lacking in handsomeness.The smoke rose, and the steamed buns were heated in the pot, and he was cutting vegetables and meat. Even if it was shady and cool in the mountains, the raw meat wouldn\u2019t last long, and it would be fresh only if it was eaten early.He and Shen Xuanqing often ate fish and hunted birds in the mountains. Shen Xuanqing shot accurately with the slingshot and could often bring back the birds that were shot. Wild animals such as hares and pheasants could be sold for money, and most of the birds were dead so they ate it by themself, and they also had a meaty smell.But compared to these things, country people were reluctant to eat and drink all year round. Most of them like to eat fatty pork, and pork with more fat was more delicious. Lu Gu was no exception, and Shen Xuanqing who had three years of hard life, the same is true.Lu Gu fried the meat with autumn chili peppers, the meat was plentiful and rich, and mixed with a vegetable, which was crisp and greasy, two bowls of vegetables were enough for the two of them.You need to be very careful in this kind of deep mountain forest. As soon as it got dark, Shen Xuanqing came back and didn't stay outside.After the three dogs came in, he lowered the threshold and closed the courtyard door, and covered it with a thick tree trunk. Taking advantage of this time, Lu Gu brought all the meals to the table.After washing his hands, he went into the main room and saw that there was meat to eat tonight, so Shen Xuanqing went to the kitchen to get a bowl, and poured a small bowl of wine.After he sat down, he asked Lu Gu, \"Have a taste?\"Lu Gu shook his head, the wine tasted spicy, he couldn't drink it, Shen Xuanqing didn't force it, and drank half of the bowl by himself while eating the meat.The mountain breeze was cold, and the taste of being full of wine and food made people felt at ease, and good days were nothing more than this.After washing and lying down at night, Shen Xuanqing held Lu Gu in his arms, and smelled such a soft breath again. He obviously only drank a little, but now he was slightly drunk from the alcohol that had disappeared while drinking, making his heart itchy and hot. As soon as he turned over, he crushed the person underneath.Shen Xuanqing and Lu Gu worked for another three days to dig the pond and the big fence outside the house. The outside of the house was no better than the backyard. The fence must be denser, otherwise the chickens would squeeze out along the cracks or other things would come in and drag the chickens away, as this would require a lot of bamboo, and the two of them went to the bamboo forest and cut ten more. Shen Xuanqing couldn't resist once, so he ran twice.The pond was dug to a depth of about one person. When Shen Xuanqing was standing inside digging, Lu Gu took a hemp rope and hung a basket on the top of the pit, and poured the excavated soil to the side. Because of the size of the pond, Shen Xuanqing was also cautious. After digging, people standing inside were afraid of the soil collapsingso he\u00a0\u00a0used the shovel to pat the soil wall tightly.After the pond was dug, a small canal was dug from the side next to the river to divert water from the side of the river. Finally, with a shovel, the small canal was opened, and the river water flowed in. Several big stones were moved to block the river, allowing the water to flow towards the pond.\u00a0Those few stones were really not light, and he pushed and moved them, which made him slowed down on the shore for a while after coming up.Lu Gu wanted to help just now, but such a big rock couldn't be moved at all. Shen Xuanqing laughed when he saw it. He tried it, and then moved away with a sullen head.The river water was rushing into the pit, and when Shen Xuanqing saw him squatting in like a small ball by the pond, it made people felt sorry for him and wanted to lift him up.\u00a0After taking the breath, the tall man finally couldn't hold back, picked him up, and gently rubbed his hair in his arms.Lu Gu who was suddenly picked up was startled. Shen Xuanqing was still panting because he was too tired to move the stone. His strong and broad chest seemed to be hot. The big strong hand pressed on his head and rubbed it lightly, letting his face accidentally stuck to Shen Xuanqing's chest.Obviously he couldn't see the expression, but from the ups and downs of Shen Xuanqing's chest and the faint beating of his heart, he felt that Shen Xuanqing was happy.was it so happy to hug him? He was actually puzzled.It wasn't until he realized that he was hugged for a long time that he blushed later, and felt that Shen Xuanqing's body was too hot. The heat came to his face, and even he felt hot, and he didn't dare to raise his head in his arms.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Because it was cold at night, he would drive the chickens and ducks to the main room to sleep at night. He made two shallow flat baskets with bamboo strips and spread hay inside. Before going to bed, he used two newly made small bamboo baskets to cover the grass nests of the chickens and ducks, and poked a wooden stick on the mouth of the upside-down bamboo baskets, leaving a gap.Shen Xuanqing was too tired these days, and he hadn't woken up yet. When Lu Gu woke up, he knew that it was sometimes like this when he woke up early. Lu Gu first boiled water to heat up steamed buns and pancakes, and then he slept for a while.Remove the bamboo baskets. Some chickens and ducks were awakened, fluttering their wings and chirping twice. Seeing that they were all well, Lu Gu covered the bamboo baskets and let them out after the sun came out.He opened the two doors of the main room, and the coldness came in. The three dogs sleeping in the corner of the room curled up even tighter. Dahui still glanced at him, but he didn't seem to get up.The flames at the bottom of the stove rose, and some fine firewood was added to it, and it quickly became hot. Lu Gu opened the lid and saw that there were still about ten steamed buns. Shen Xuanqing brought a few into the mountains as dry food.He put a drawer in the pot and put four steamed buns on it to heat up. After covering the pot, he hesitated for a moment, then picked up a bowl and scooped up a bowl and a half from the bag of white flour.White flour didn't even weigh 30 catties, so naturally he should eat sparingly. Since he entered the mountain, he had only made scallion pancake with soup twice, and he was reluctant to eat more.The water boiled quickly, and the steamed buns became soft and hot after covering them for a while. He used a bowl to cover the hot steamed buns, otherwise the heat would escape.\u00a0Listening to the movement in the room again, Shen Xuanqing was awake, the sky in the east had just turned white, and it was still early.Lu Gu scooped boiling water to heat the flour, so that the pancakes could be cooked faster, and you didn't have to wait for the flour to rise before making them.\u00a0Having been in the mountains with Shen Xuanqing for so many days, he was more proficient at cooking and frying vegetables than before. He kneaded the dough very neatly. Five small dough cakes came out quickly. The fire at the bottom of the pot hadn\u2019t been extinguished yet. Put the pancake dough on the pan and turned it over to bake.Shen Xuanqing finally got up, and the three dogs followed him out.Dahui yawned, and the little dog stretched its four long legs in the yard, and stretched its waist.Shen Xuanqing was washing in the courtyard, and he was not afraid of the cold, so he washed with cold water.\u00a0Lu Gu had just washed, he picked up the pickles, brought out the four steamed buns in a bowl, there were two bowls of water on the table in the main room, it was warm enough to drink now, the two of them sat at the table to eat and drink.Lu Gu ate less in the morning, one steamed bun was enough, and the remaining three belonged to Shen Xuanqing.\"Want to look for the snails today?\" Shen Xuanqing asked him, and after seeing him nodding, he said, \"I will keep the Dahui for you, don't go too far, it's okay if you can't found it.\"\"Yes.\" Lu Gu nodded in response.he had been busy with fences and ponds for the past few days, and he didn\u2019t go hunting in the mountains. He had to go out today. Shen Xuanqing packed up after eating. Seeing that the small cloth bag that usually hold dry food in the bamboo basket was shriveled, he went to the kitchen by himself and took the food.Lu Gu was washing the pickle bowl, saw him came in to remove the lid of the pot, took six steamed buns with mixed flour \u00a0and stuffed them into the cloth bag, Shen Xuanqing packed them before he could speak.He stood up so anxiously that he didn't even have time to wipe his wet hands. Shen Xuanqing walked out with a cloth bag, just in front of him. In a hurry, he reached out to grab the corner of Shen Xuanqing's clothes, and found that his hands were wet, leaving behind a little wet mark in the corners of his clothes. He was frightened and cowardly, quickly let go and said anxiously: \"You wait.\"Shen Xuanqing had to stop, and for the first time, Lu Gu held the corner of his clothes and approached timidly, which made him smile a little meaning.The cloth bag in his hand was taken away by Lu Gu, he didn't know what to do, he saw Lu Gu lifted the lid of the pot and took out five white flour pancakes from it.This thing was different. It was made for Shen Xuanqing alone. He bought chickens and ducklings for him and treated him so well. Embarrassed, he lowered his head and gave a short, shy smile, and said in a low voice, \"Eat this for dry food in the mountains.\"white flour were better than miscellaneous flour, and Shen Xuanqing had to work hard to hunt, so he must eat better.After receiving the cloth bag, the white pancake inside was still hot, making Shen Xuanqing felt warm in his hands, and seeing Lu Gu smiled so shyly, the string in his heart seemed to be gently plucked, his own little fulang thought about himself so much that he didn't know how to express that joy, his handsome face was smiling a little silly.Lu Gu looked at him with such a smile, he became more and more shy and didn\u2019t dare to raise his head. Finally, he heard the dog barking twice towards the courtyard gate, and Shen Xuanqing came back to his senses.Lu Gu escorted him to the door, he and Dahui watched him and the dog walk into the forest, and turned back to the yard to start a busy day when they could no longer see him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 60": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Sweet Little FulangCH 31.2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter\u00a0the sun came out, the quiet mountain forest was no longer as scary as at night. When encountering a place with dense grass, Lu Gu used the long wooden stick in his hand to explore the grass and clear the way, and Dahui followed him all the way.\u00a0Walking along the direction where he picked the mushrooms last time, he really found a mountain stream.The stream flowed down the mountain. The water looked extremely clear, even clearer than the Qingxi River. There were tender green watercress growing beside the stream. Lu Gu felt fresh and tender when he pinched it. After taking a bite, he decided to pick more and wait for Shen Xuanqing to come back to eat it at night.This watercress was tenderer than the ones he picked by the river in the village before. He thought it would be delicious when he made it into salads. It could also be stir-fried or fried with meat. There were not many pickles in the jar. The watercress could be marinated in vinegar for a day or two. You could eat it, it was sour and crunchy, and you could eat it with sour pickles, otherwise you would always eat salty.\u00a0Fortunately, he came out today with a big bamboo basket on his back, so he could get some back.He was not in a hurry, there was no one else here, so he took off his shoes and socks, rolled up his trousers and got into the water.\u00a0Since he came here specially to look for the snails, he naturally wouldn't go back too early. Lu Gu brought himself four steamed buns with mixed flour and put them in a cloth bag. Now that he was in the water, he tied the cloth bag to the back rope of the bamboo basket.There were quite a lot of stones in the water, he opened several pieces and finally saw four green snails with thin shells, all of them were quite big, but the shells were too fragile and thin, some of them were not mature enough, they would break if you squeezed it hard .Lu Gu's hands were light, and he didn't want to crush them, so he touched them and threw them into the bamboo basket behind his back gently.\u00a0He walked along the stream to the place where there were many rocks above, and searched all the rocks that could be turned over, looking for them very carefully.He even found a small crab which was called purple belly in the mountain stream, which was either under the stone or hidden in the muddy water. It got its name because of the purple color on its belly. He didn\u2019t know what the other place called it. If it was like in their countryside. It was called a kind of expensive mountain delicacy.When he was in Anjia Village, he saw someone went up the mountain to catch some, but that person didn't sell them, he took them home and fried them himself, and after eating them, he showed off in the village for a while, saying that he was eating like the rich men in the town. This stuff could be fried with peppercorns, since it was for food, Lu Gu wouldn't let it go easily, and catched the purple belly and green snails together.When he saw the purple belly, he remembered that this thing was as expensive as green snails, but this deep mountain was not as good as when he was in the foot mountain, and he could go to the town to sell something he caught. Shen Xuanqing was better, he walked fast, and he could go to town in an hour and a half.But he also thought that snail and crabs were like loaches when they were caught. They needed to be raised for a few days to spit out mud, and they could survive for a few days in the water. If you catched some and kept them in the water for two days, you could take them back with wooden barrels, and they were easier to carry than fish. Small crabs could live well out of the water for a while. He would soak the green snails in wine and left only the snail meat, which was still lighter.\u00a0Thinking of this, Lu Gu became eager. He wanted to find more. Shen Xuanqing and his family couldn't finish eating, and they could even sell them in the town for money.Fearing that the small crabs would be crushed or the green snails would be eaten, he picked a few large leaves to wrap the green snails. After he found a lot of leaves, he wrapped them with slender and strong grass stems and threw them into the bamboo basket. No need to be afraid.Belly purple used its sharp legs to move in the bamboo basket. Sometimes it seemed that they were climbing up. Lu Gu patted the bamboo basket with his backhand a few times, and the little crab that had just climbed a little fell into the bottom of the bamboo basket again. .There was a splash of water, it was Lu Gu who grabbed a purple belly from the muddy water, held it in the clear water, shook it with his hands and washed it, and it was clean quickly.The stream was muddy due to him walking and washing the mud, but after he left, it cleared up again not long after.Dahui waded in the water for a while, then returned to the shore, fluttering his body and flicking his fur, splashing water on Lu Gu's body, he looked up at Dahui, with a slight smile in his eyes, followed by a dog was really reassuring, even if you went far, you wouldn't feel that you couldn't find your way back.This mountain stream was quite long. He searched along the stream for a long time, rummaging both upstream and downstream. When he felt hungry, he looked up and saw the sun above his head. It was already noon, so he went to the bank and sat down. Rest on a big rock.He moved his shoes and socks as he walked, so as not to lose them. After his feet were dry, he put them on. When he saw edible red fruits in the grass beside him, he picked them all up, squatted by the stream, washed them, and tasted a sweet one, it was too small.Seeing Dahui approaching, he tried to feed Dahui two, but unexpectedly, he ate it. It turned out that dogs also liked to eat fruit.\u00a0Not only grass red fruit, but when he waded over the water just now, he saw a water bun tree. The fruits on it were all red, and they were still big, but he didn't know whether it was bitter bun or sweet bun.\u00a0This kind of wild fruit was small and juicy, and when it was ripe, it could burst open like a water bun, so it was called water bun tree.\u00a0Lu Gu walked over and tiptoed to pull off a branch, picked a small red fruit and bit the skin lightly, feeling the sweetness of the juice, his eyes were full of joy, it was a sweet bun.There were more bitter bun tree than sweet, eight out of ten trees were bitter, the kind of bitterness that even adults couldn't stand, let alone ate it, just like he just bit the fruit peel and the tip of the tongue got the juice, The tip of the tongue was bitter and numb, and people who were not used to the bitter taste would retch, not to mention how uncomfortable it was.So after tasting the sweetness, Lu Gu was very pleasantly surprised. He picked some red ones and took them to the stream to wash. The redder the fruit, the riper it was. The flesh inside was soft and full of juice. He stuffed one in his mouth one bite, and the sweet juice would overflow.Seeing Dahui beside him, he broke open a sweet bun and handed it over. Dahui smelled it, opened his mouth and ate it, and even licked the sweet juice from his fingers.\u00a0One person and one dog shared and ate the sweet buns he had picked.Lu Gu gnawed two and a half of the four steamed buns, and gave the remaining one and a half to Dahui. Dahui followed him today and didn't have time to catch bamboo rats and chase rabbits, so he couldn't let him go hungry.After eating, he found a clear place, took a few sips of it with his hands, and Dahui followed him to drink water with his head down. He looked like human and intelligent.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He took out the cloth bun \u00a0from the basket. The pancakes were already cold, but his heart was warm.He thought of Lu Gu, but his fulang was not around, so he had no choice but to give up, even the smile in his eyes was replaced by sadness, he sat down with no expression on his face, and ate the white pancake after drinking water.Before he knew it, he thought of Lu Gu again. His little fulang was obedient and hardworking. He wanted to make it for him when he heard that he wanted to hunt, he was so cute. He looked pretty when he smiled, but he was too thin.That day at Zhao Butcher's house, he saw Lu Gu hugging the child, and he remembered it to this day. Wang Langzhong also talked about childbirth. Now that he calmed down, he thought a lot. The first thing was to earn more money, with white flour, new rice and meat to eat, Lu Gu would be well-fed and fat. Otherwise, when it came time to give birth, if he was too thin, he would suffer.Besides, you needed to be rich to raise a child. The poor people in the country could marry and have children, but the childrens were as thin as monkeys. They either ran around or worked early for others, they had to suffer more than ordinary farm childrens.He had studied and often went to the town, and he had seen more people and things. Now that he thought about childbirth, he naturally didn\u2019t want his children to suffer and suffered to be herd cattle and worked for others, no matter whether it was a boy, a girl, or a shuang'er, it was best to be able to read, at least you wouldn't have to suffer from illiteracy in the future.What was Shen Xuanqing thinking alone? Lu Gu didn't know, he continued to search along the stream after eating, and walked back after more than an hour.It was just over halfway in the afternoon, and it was still too early for the sun to set. The reason why he was walking back now was that he was afraid of the mountains and forests after dark, and because he walked along the stream for a long time, and went to other nearby streams to search for it. If you wanted to go back, you had to follow the stream to find the way you came, which took more effort, so naturally you had to leave early.Under the bamboo basket were more than 70 small purple crabs, and green snails wrapped in big leaves. There were several big bun s, at least two hundred, and it took him a long time for just these, not long after the sun rose in the morning. At this moment, it was also fortunate that there were few people here, otherwise there would be nothing like this in a day.There were purple belly, green snails, sweet fruits, and the tender green watercress neatly stacked. He picked more than half of the basket. Because the bamboo basket was big, there were quite a lot of these, and it could be eaten for a long time.Finally, when he found the way to go back, Lu Gu saw a few edible mushrooms by the roadside, and picked them up. In the deep mountains where there were many things, as long as you knew what to eat, you wouldn't starve to death.As he was walking, he saw a big fallen tree in the distance, so he probed the grass with a wooden stick, and when he saw that there was no snake, he walked there, and Dahui didn't make any noise, presumably there was nothing hidden in it.When he came last time, he found that the tree had fallen down. It should have been there for a long time, but because he was anxious to go back after picking the mushrooms last time, he didn't go to see it.This tree had been down for a while, and it was all rotten. As Lu Gu imagined, there were several clusters of black mushrooms growing on it. This thing not only grew on the rotten wood, sometimes it could be seen on the tree, but it needed to climb or used the long bamboo pole with the hook.There were not many black mushrooms, and he only ate them a few times after picking them all up and drying them, but he didn't miss them. Wasn't these things just accumulated little by little.The mushrooms and black mushrooms were placed on top of the watercress. Lu Gu saw that there was nothing to pick here, so he went back to the road just now, and came back to see after a while, maybe the mushrooms would grow again.The sky was blue and far away, and the mountain breeze was warm. It really was autumn and the air was refreshing. With so many things, Lu Gu's mood was also more relaxed, with joy in his eyes and heart.Before Shen Xuanqing left in the morning, he gave him the key to the courtyard door. As soon as Lu Gu came back and opened the door, he ran to the backyard to see the chickens and ducklings. He thought they were grazing, and he went outside to pluck young grass and chop it up. If he was not busy at the moment, he would have to go to the river to dig earthworms. They would eat it, both chickens and ducks, and they would grow flesh after eating them.After finishing all this work, he packed up the things in the bamboo basket. There were red and yellow sweet bun s fruit. The red ones were too ripe and the skins would be easily broken when bumping and colliding on the road. So he also picked the yellow fruits with thick skins and ate them today. It could be eaten after a few days of ripening, and he had picked a lot.\u00a0Now that he knew where there was a sweet bun \u00a0tree, he would go there again before going back down the mountain, and brought some to Shen Yan and the others to taste.He took out a lot of watercress piled up in a pile, and then there were a few packages of green snails with thin shells, some of which had only one layer of leaves, which were crushed by crab claws, and some green snails were exposed. He put them in the wooden basin. Poured water and dropped a few drops of oil, poured all the green snails in, and keep them for a few days to spit out sand.As for the small purple belly crabs at the bottom, most of them were alive. He picked out a dozen or so and scrubbed them clean. He was going to fry a plate for Shen Xuanqing to try something new, and put the rest in a bucket, sprinkled some salt and raised them for two days. He also used bamboo plaques to buckle and press the wood to prevent them from climbing out.The newly picked black mushrooms was edible, so he took out a bamboo plaque and put it on to dry, and soaked it to eat after drying.He made some bamboo baskets last time, but he felt that they were not enough for such a use. No wonder there were so many bamboo plaques in the homes of the people who gather herbs and mountain products in the village to dry.There were still some bamboo strips from the previous two days, so he would have to weave some more when he was free tomorrow.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 62": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Sweet Little FulangCH 32.2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe autumn vegetables planted in the front yard were no longer wilting, and they were watered every two days to make them looked juicy, just fried with mushrooms, mixed with watercress, and purple belly, this meal was very good.When Shen Xuanqing came back in the evening, Lu Gu had already cooked. The hot dishes and rice wine were stuffed in the pot, and they were still warm when they were brought out.Shen Xuanqing\u00a0was washing his hands in front of the kitchen door. Seeing Lu Gu bringing out a bowl of small fresh crabs from the mountain, he smiled and said, \"There was this. Did you run far away today?\"\u201cI just caught it back, and there were still some in the bucket.\" Lu Gu replied in a low voice, because today\u2019s harvest was quite good, he was really happy in his heart, and he and Shen Xuanqing became a little familiar, he hesitated and continued: \"There are more, I found the sweet buns, watercress. The pickle jar is empty, and so I pickled some sour cress to eat.\"As soon as Shen Xuanqing entered the door, he saw the washed watercress on the bamboo plaque, nodded and smiled, he said: \"Okay, I'll listen to you.\"For some reason, this remark made Lu Gu felt a bit unspeakable, as if he could decide some things, but he was very cautious, so how could he ask such a question? .Because sweet buns were hard to come by, when he put away the bowl and came to the kitchen to get steamed buns, he saw the washed red fruit, so he took two to the main room, lowered his head and handed them over, whispering, \"Here you are.\"Shen Xuanqing saw the fruit in his hand and was stunned for a moment before he took it with a smile, something melted in his heart, it was warm.The watercress was fresh and tender salad, and the fried small crabs were spicy and numb. With the addition of fried vegetables with mushrooms and rice wine, both of them were full and refreshed.It was getting dark, and Shen Xuanqing was about to close the courtyard door after feeding the dogs, when Dahui who was eating suddenly raised his head and barked outside, the two small dogs also barked, and Lu Gu, who was washing dishes in the kitchen, was caught by the sound and startled him, he had lived here for so long, he had never heard the dogs barked like this before at night.Fortunately, it wasn't some wild beast, and the barking of the dogs was not very intense. A figure came out from the woods in front of the courtyard, and Shen Xuanqing recognized it carefully.\"Amitabha, Benefactor Shen, I went to the mountain to collect herbs, but I couldn't make it down the mountain at night, so I came to disturb your quietness again.\" Huitong stood still in front of the courtyard, and didn\u2019t rush in.Shen Xuanqing saluted him back, and said: \"Master Huitong, please come in.\"\"Thank you, Benefactor Shen.\" Then monk Huitong came in.Seeing that Shen Xuanqing was going to push the gate of the courtyard, he helped to lift the thick tree trunk before the bamboo basket was unloaded, because he was a monk before, although he was not as tall as Shen Xuanqing, he still had some strength.He turned around and saw Lu Gu, chanted a Buddhist name and asked, \"I wonder what the honorable name of this benefactor is?\"\"My fulang\u2019s surname is Lu and his name is Lu Gu.\" Shen Xuanqing smiled.\"It turned out to be the benefactor Lu, disrespectful, disrespectful. The poor monk Huitong was a monk of Jingxin Temple.\" Huitong gave the Buddhist ceremony again.Lu Gu quickly folded his palms and said: \"Master Huitong.\"He had met the monk twice, but he had never spoken to him, so he was inevitably a little nervous.Shen Xuanqing was familiar with Huitong. When the other party went up the mountain to collect medicines and couldn't go down, he would come to spend the night and leave some medicinal materials when he left. He asked: \"Master, have you eaten? There are vegetarian dishes here, and the oil is also vegetarian oil.\"\" That's it, thank you very much.\" Then, Huitong took out a pack of dry food from the unloaded bamboo basket, and he didn't need to help, he went to the kitchen to heat the water and the dry food.Shen Xuanqing grabbed a large handful of watercress from the bamboo plaque and took it in. Huitong knew how to cook vegetables, it was always good to eat some hot vegetables and rice after running in the mountains for a day.Seeing two bowls of red sweet bun fruits on the chopping board, Lu Gu picked quite a lot, Shen Xuanqing only took a smaller bowl, and said: \"Master can take this fruit to eat.\"\"Thank you.\" Huitong, who was burning the fire, nodded his thanks without being overly polite.Lu Gu just drove chickens and ducks in from the backyard, Shen Xuanqing took the bowl of sweet bun fruits to the main room, and said: \"I will let Master Huitong eat that bowl, if you want to eat later, I will pick it with you before come back.\"This was brought back by Lu Gu after a long journey, and he was anxious to give it to him as soon as he came back. How could he spoil this intention, so he had to tell him.And the monk Huitong used to help the old hunter as a langzhong and gave the medicinal materials, but he didn't take any money. The same was true for the poor people. It was enough to show that he had a good heart.\"It's good, we can't finish it, so it's okay to give it.\" Lu Gu said, the sweet bun fruits would go bad if they were kept for a long time after they were so red. The yellow astringent fruit could be eaten after two days of ripening.\"Hmm.\" The smile on Shen Xuanqing's face was even bigger, he knew that his fulang was a rare good fulang in the world, and in order to reassure Lu Gu, he also told about Huitong's medical treatment to the old hunter.Now Lu Gu felt that he should give others more food, such a good monk, how could he be stingy with this little thing.It was getting dark, and there was an extra monk Huitong, and later he would lay a mattress in the east room to rest at night, so Shen Xuanqing lit the oil lamp, and by the way, took out the things in the bamboo basket by the light.The stupid rabbits that had been caught had already been locked in a cage in the woodshed. There were still chestnuts wrapped in big leaves in the bamboo basket, which he picked up when he passed by. They were crisp, it would taste even better when the sun came out tomorrow.He peeled some for Lu Gu to eat, no one peeled chesnut for him except his mother, who gave him a sweet chestnut, he carefully raised his head, and looked at Shen Xuanqing who was peeling chestnuts with drooping eyebrows and eyes under the candlelight.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The resolute and cold face seemed to soften a bit. He lowered his head to peel the chestnuts. The keenness he acquired from hunting made him aware of something. When he looked up, he saw Lu Gu dazed eyes.Caught off guard into those pair of star pupils, the candles reflected in Shen Xuanqing's eyes, bright and a little softer, Lu Gu suddenly became at a loss, and hurriedly looked away.He lowered his head and was embarrassed, and wanted to cover up the rude behavior of staring at him just now, so he stuffed the chestnuts into his mouth. Raw chestnuts were not as sweet as ripe ones, they were not crunchy and sweet. He even picked up the chestnuts and peeled them himself, couldn't wait for others to peel it for him.Shen Xuanqing was also stunned for a moment, he didn't understand love, but he was happy to live with Lu Gu, he didn't know what Lu Gu was thinking when he saw him, he wanted to ask, but seeing Lu Gu was so nervous, the words that wanted to come out of his mouth couldn't come out.Then he lowered his head and smiled, and passed the chestnuts in his hand again, pretending not to notice anything, and said: \"It's late at night, it's better to eat less raw things, and dry them in the sun for two days. If you want to eat them again, I'll pick them up again.\"\"Yes.\" Lu Gu nodded obediently, he chewed the one in his mouth, peeled off the one in his hand, hesitated for a while and wanted to hand it to Shen Xuanqing, but he didn't make any movement yet, and saw Shen Xuanqing bowing his head to himself. After peeling one and eating it, he had to rest his mind.It was getting late, and the stomach felt uncomfortable after eating too much of this food. After eating a few, they went to the east room with candlesticks to make a bed for monk Huitong.There was an extra person, it was not easy for Lu Gu to wash his face in the yard, so Shen Xuanqing brought a basin of water into the room for him to wash, and brought in water for washing his feet.After the monk Huitong finished eating, Shen Xuanqing chatted with him for a while, Lu Gu didn't intend to listen to what he was saying, and besides the door was closed, he couldn't hear clearly, so he lay down first after washing.The night was dim, and the light in the room was not lit. He lay on his back and looked at the roof. For a while, he thought about weaving two bamboo plaques tomorrow. he had to pickle the watercress tomorrow, and Shen Xuanqing would be able to taste it the next morning.He turned over and closed his eyes, and there was a faint voice of someone talking outside the door, as if he was blocked by the door.The emptiness around him made him a little uncomfortable, but he didn't notice anything because of his dullness, and when he fell asleep and stopped thinking about things, he fell asleep soundly.The habit was there, but not to the point of being intolerable or even noticeable.In the early morning of the next day, Monk Huitong left some medicinal materials and bid farewell to Shen Xuanqing and Lu Gu.The kindly-eyed monk chanted the Buddha's name, bowed his head slightly and gave a small salute, raised his head again, turned and left.The night was dark last night, Lu Gu didn't dare to look at people, until now he saw the face of Monk Huitong clearly, when he met those eyes, he suddenly knew what \"compassion\" was.The two of them went back to the yard again, Lu Gu went to boil water to heat the steamed buns, Shen Xuanqing evenly put the medicinal herbs on the bamboo plaque to dry, they were common medicinal herbs for treating typhoid fever, it was good to prepare some, and took the chestnuts to the yard to dry for a few days.The stupid tit in the firewood house cooed like a chicken, but the sound was more dull. Although this thing was called a tit, it couldn\u2019t fly. It looked stupid and big, with sharp claws and a long beak. Came here to peck and scratch a few claw marks, blood would flow profusely immediately, most people didn't dare to look for it, and it was hidden deep in the old forest, which was rare in recent years.The stupid tit meat was not very delicious, but the feathers were bright and beautiful and \u00a0quite popular among Fucheng people, and they were used to decorate screens or other things.When Shen Xuanqing caught it, he only hurt its wings, and tied it with hemp rope before approaching. He carried a small bundle of chicken grass into the firewood house, and threw it in front of the stupid tit that was tied up and couldn't escape. If he wasn't there, he couldn't call Lu Gu to approach it, otherwise it would be enough to be pecked.He took another look at the hemp rope on the stupid tit's feet, and found that it had been pecked a little bit. The thing's beak was really sharp, so he turned around and took a thicker and stronger hemp rope to tie it again.\"The door of the firewood room is closed. Don't open it until I come back. This stupid tit broke two strands of the hemp rope with its beak.\" He bolted the door of the firewood room and told Lu Gu.Lu Gu was timid, and he could be said to obey his words, so there was no one who wouldn\u2019t listen.After eating, Shen Xuanqing took the dog and left. There was no Dahui left behind today. Lu Gu watched them walked away, turned around and returned to the yard, and remembered that the bamboo strips were all placed in the woodshed. When Shen Xuanqing locked the door, he didn't remember it. Now he had to give up.Since he stopped weaving bamboo plaques, he saw that there were some unsplit logs piled up in the courtyard, so he simply took a long ax to chop firewood.This ax was heavy, but fortunately he was used to the work, so he wouldn't be unable to swing it. There was also skill in chopping wood. With a swing of both hands, the weight of the ax could be used to chop down, and the wood would be split in one fell swoop without much effort.He chopped all the firewood by himself for less than half an hour, and piled it up neatly. Seeing that there was not much firewood left. Shen Xuanqing cast a net into the river the day before yesterday, and he might have fish later. In the evening, stew a fish soup with a small medicine stove.Thin firewood was better for stewing things, and the fire woPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Yesterday he came back a little late and didn\u2019t come to check the fish. Now he saw that there were three fish in the net, one big and two small, the small one was also longer than his palm.These three fish must have been trapped for a long time and didn\u2019t break free. They looked rather listless at the moment. He collected and killed them on a flat stone on the shore. He took out the internal organs and threw them into a basket to take it back and feed the ducks.The chickens and ducklings that Shen Xuanqing bought back were not too small, and after several days of raising, they were ready to be eaten, just chop them up.After killing the fish, he dug some earthworms in the mud by the river, which could be eaten by chickens and ducks.Before Lu Gu went back with the fish basket, he grabbed the aquatic plants by the river and the chicken grass on the ground. He didn't think much about it. He felt that people should eat vegetables and meat, and the ducks and chickens ate earthworms and fish offal, you still have to eat some grass to relieve the greasy.On the way back from the river, you could see the large dense fence surrounded, which was for him to raise chickens, but because he was too rare for chickens and ducks, he wanted to raise them in the backyard for another two days to make them a little bigger, otherwise if they were too small, what should he do if they couldn't beat the big bugs, or they would choke when they ate it.The little paws of the chickens were just that big, and they were incomparable with the big hen. He couldn't even think about how they hold the bug down with such small paws.No one knew about his worries, and fortunately no one knew, otherwise people would laugh at him for being childish and careless.Using a knife for chopping chicken grass, he crushed fish viscera, crushed the grass and mixed them together, then Lu Gu took the food bowl to the backyard to feed the chickens and ducks.Touching the fluffy chickens and ducks, he felt satisfied. When they grew up, they would be able to lay eggs. Ji Qiuyue told him that Shen Xuanqing loved eggs. He never dared to forget that hens lay eggs every day, so Shen Xuanqing would have eggs to eat every day.As for duck eggs, there was a river here, and many people raised ducks, but because duck egg were more fishy than chicken egg, it was often pickled into salted eggs instead of fried. People liked it, but he didn't know much about it yet. When he really saved duck eggs, whether they were sold or pickled, Shen Xuanqing shouldn\u2019t care, then he could be the master for a while.After thinking about it, he realized that he was thinking too far, and he felt a little embarrassed himself.Lu Gu went back to the front yard and saw that the goji berries he had picked earlier had dried up. While the things were turning red, it was better to get more, so he put the bamboo basket on his back, put the hatchet and scissors, locked the door and went out.Not far from the courtyard, there was a field of wild wolfberry, which was full of red fruits. He cut off the branches full of small red fruits with scissors, bundled them up and put them into bamboo baskets. When it was full, he picked up two small wolfberry trees that could be chopped and had more fruit, and he could drag them back even if they were not easy to carry.A busy morning has passed, and Lugu hadn\u2019t picked the branches, so he made a simple lunch for himself.He continued to work after eating, and when the goji berries were finished and the watercress was soaked in the jar, he had time to sit and rest under the eaves for a while.There were fish and boiled lard in the kitchen, green snails and small purple crabs soaked in water and spit out sand, vegetables were grown in the yard, there were five bamboo plaques on wooden shelves to dry things, wolfberry, black mushrooms, mushrooms and medicinal materials, Lu Gu saw that all of these were more or less related to him, and after passing through his hands, he could also eat and use them, and even sold them for money.He still remembered when he couldn\u2019t eat until full before, so he was more grateful and satisfied now that he was full, and he was never tired of working, because he could also share of these things.After resting, he went to his room to get a sewing basket. He had been busy going up the mountain for the past few days, so he didn't have time to make a purse.People who were capable of embroidery were generally dexterous, and Lu Gu was like this. He was not likely to get suntan when he was young, and his fingers looked fine and white.\u00a0But his hands were different from those who only do embroidery work. They often had scars or scratches. After all, they were used for work, and the palms of his hands were not delicate.He sat alone in the yard embroidering things without being disturbed, and the purse came out in the afternoon, and the smaller purse also had a figure of a tiger pattern for Shen Xuanqing to use.When he used to embroider sachets and medicine pouches, he knew that men in towns would also use patterns of flowers and plants. They said it was elegant, because Shen Xuanqing was taller than others, and all Lu Gu could think of were patterns like lions, tigers and leopards. Afraid that Shen Xuanqing wouldn\u2019t want it.In the evening, Shen Xuanqing came back, the fish soup stewed on the medicine stove was gurgling, and the smell of vegetables wafted from the kitchen, and the new money bag that Lu Gu handed over carefully, saying it was for him, surprised him and pleased him a bit.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 65": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Sweet Little FulangCH 34.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayShen Xuanqing looked at the money bag embroidered with lion patterns, it was more delicate than the ones he had used before, and it was not too small, it was more than enough to hold more than two hundred copper coins on hand.The peasants were poor, their money bag mostly made of coarse clothes and few bright colors. When he was young, his home was fine, but Wei Lanxiang\u2019s embroidery work was not as good as Lu Gu\u2019s. If he could make it at home, there was\u00a0 no reason to buy it outside. Besides, he didn\u2019t pay much attention to these things, as long as he could hold money.After Lu Gu gave him the money bag, he lowered his head and said embarrassedly: \"I'll serve the food.\"The food in the kitchen was ready, just waiting to be eaten.Shen Xuanqing looked away from the money bag, the day's hard work seemed to be wiped away after receiving the money bag, it was made for him by his fulang\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 .He unconsciously showed a smile, and when he saw Lu Gu brought something out, he quickly stuffed the money bag into his arms, stepped forward courteously, and because of the surprise and excitement in his heart, he snatched Lu Gu's works, and said, \"I'll do it.\"Shen Xuanqing looked over with a smile in his eyes, which made Lu Gu a little flustered. Recently, he knew that Shen Xuanqing was handsome, but he didn't expect that with smile he would become even more handsome. He didn't dare to look more, thinking it would be rude and offensive.When the two of them sat down to eat, the smile on Shen Xuanqing's face remained undiminished, and the money bag was still in his arms, and he used this to pack the twenty taels of silver that he had exchanged after going down the mountain.There were often people in the family, so it was\u00a0 more at ease to put the money down the mountain, so as to avoid the need to carry it back and forth up and down the mountain.The fish soup was delicious, and there was a bowl in front of both of them. Lu Gu tasted two mouthfuls, and the salt was just right. He only stewed two small fish, and the big ones was killed, and it was wrapped in coarse salt. Kept it for two days.The river was so close, and there were only two of them catching the fish. Once they were caught in the nets, there was\u00a0 almost no chance of missing them. So they often ate fish on the mountain.Shen Xuanqing's mind was always on the money bag in his arms, it was a joy, like a blossoming of joy.\u00a0It wass just that he suddenly remembered something, stopped his chopsticks, hesitated before asking: \"When we are in Lu's house, you and Lu Wen both know how to do these things?\"Because the Lu family was mentioned, he felt a little uneasy.\"Money bags and sachets.\" Shen Xuanqing added.It turned out to be this, Lu Gu nodded subconsciously and said: \"Well, he can do it too.\"Shen Xuanqing heard that this was not quite right, and asked again: \"Then he often makes it and sells it to subsidize his family?\"Lu Gu was stunned, Putting down his chopsticks, his brows and eyes were puzzled, and he denied: \"He often said that he would read and copy books, and occasionally he made one or two, Du...\"He paused and continued: \"Du Hehua took his, and the ones I made together. Sell it in the town.\"From Lu Gu's point of view, Lu Wen's doing this was by no means a regular practice.When he was in Lu's house, Lu Wen ignored him. In the village, they seldom went out together. Because he was boring and not talkative at that time, and Du Hehua threatened him again, so he seldom talked to the villagers or gossipped together, so he didn\u2019t know how Du Hehua bragged about Lu Wen to outsiders.And even if he heard someone praise for Lu Wen, he bowed his head and left because of his cowardice. People often said that he was\u00a0 out of sight and out of mind, so he wouldn't be sad if he couldn't hear it.Hearing this, Shen Xuanqing frowned. At the beginning, the matchmaker told him that Lu Wen was sensible and caring, and that he was not like a young master who didn't do any work. It turned out to be a lie, but it made sense, if Lu Wen was really like what the matchmaker said Well, how could you do things like crazy.He hated the Lu family even more, but after seeing Lu Gu's uneasy expression, he felt a sense of gratitude that made him stretch his brows. Fortunately, it was Lu Gu who married back, not a villain like Lu Wen.\"It's nothing, I'll just ask. When we got engaged, Du Hehua told the matchmaker that he made the money bag and sachet, but now it seems that's not the case.\" Shen Xuanqing said a few words, seeing Lu Gu in a daze, he hesitated , and said: \"What you made were better than the ones I have seen in the town.\"When\u00a0Lu Gu heard that Du Hehua put the money bag and the sachet he made on Lu Wen's head, he felt awkward and uncomfortable. It was him who did a lot.It was just that before the grievance surfaced in his heart, he heard Shen Xuanqing said that he was good.The word \"good\" made him bowed his head shyly, and he felt joyful because of the praise, so he couldn't help whispering: \"This money bag is big, it can hold a lot of silvers and a lot of copper coins, and I bought other cloth, and I'll make it for you a small money bag, which can hold scattered silver and a hundred or so copper coins, and can be used when going out.\"When he was at home at the foot of the mountain, Shen Xuanqing glanced at Lu Gu's sewing basket, but didn't pay attention, his mother and sister-in-law often did some needlework, he thought that Lu Gu was also doing it, so he didn't think about it at all, and now he heard that he wanted to make a money bag for him, and he put aside all the bad things, and nothing was as good as his fulang making things for himself, he was happy.\"Okay, give it to me when you're done.\" He promised again and again, and urged him earnestly as if he was afraid that Lu Gu wouldn\u2019t give it.\"En.\" Lu Gu nodded, and asked one more question: \"Then do you have any patterns you want me to embroider?\"Shen Xuanqing said, \"I will use whatever you do, and I don't understand these things .\"Hearing this, Lu Gu thought for a while, then it was better to use tiger stripes, and it always felt inappropriate to use anything else.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In the large fence outside the courtyard, the fluffy chickens and ducklings screamed from time to time, pecking the grass and chasing insects.Lu Gu released them today, and picked peppers outside the courtyard with a bamboo basket.He was afraid that the ducks would swim along the river when he couldn't see them, so he didn't put them in the pond. Anyway, the ducks also ate the leaves and the caterpillar, so they were locked in the fence with the chickens.Autumn peppercorns were turning red, bright red peppers were numb, and they should be picked within two days, otherwise the peppers would be dried and cracked by the sun, and it would be difficult to pick up when they fell to the ground, and it would be worthless if to sell.Bunches of bright red peppercorns were picked off and thrown into the nearly full bamboo basket at his feet. His hands were black and dirty after picking them all morning, and there was a smell of numbness. Be careful, or it would hurt if you got pricked by it.There was\u00a0\u00a0only one person in Lu Gu. The two peppercorns trees were quite big, and there were a lot of peppercorns. He had only picked half of them now, and he would have to work all afternoon like this.Just picking it off was not enough. If the sun was\u00a0\u00a0good these days, it would be dry in the sun for two days. After drying it, you could store it up. This thing was\u00a0\u00a0not like vegetable. Even if you used it for every meal, you couldn\u2019t eat much. If so, a large bamboo basket may not be eaten until the beginning of next spring. After a while, he would go down the mountain and carried a basket back home.Once before, he saw that Ji Qiuyue fried the dried peppercorns in oil when cooking, and the oil became numbing after it was taken out. After heating it up, she poured it on the cold dishes with a prickly sound. It tasted very special. .Because he wanted to finish this job earlier, Lu Gu worked alone for a whole day. He ate two steamed buns at noon and served with sour watercress to satisfy his hunger. Even dinner was a simple meal. The eggs, which he was not willing to eat, were stuffed in the pot together with steamed buns, and he just waited for Shen Xuanqing to come back and cooked some rice wine, poured some rice wine and added some water, and boiled it to drink, which was\u00a0\u00a0faster than cooking rice porridge, and there was\u00a0\u00a0no need to worry about setting fire.It was simple, but compared to the spicy fried rabbit meat and fish soup before, it was good for country people to eat scrambled eggs.When Shen Xuanqing came back in the evening, he heard a dog barking and hurried out from the side of the west wall, and three dogs ran over to surround him. During this period of time, even the black dog was familiar with him, but because of the previous incident, Lu Gu still liked Dahui the most.His hands were black and dirty, and he didn't touch the heads of the three dogs.Shen Xuanqing unloaded the heavy bamboo basket at the gate of the courtyard. Seeing that he hadn't finished his work, he also went to look outside the west wall.\"Not much.\" Seeing that there were not many peppercorns left on the trees, he simply picked them together with Lu Gu, and it wouldn\u2019t be too late to eat later.The chickens crowed in the fence circle, the fence door was closed, and Dahui stood upright, resting his front paws on the bamboo fence and looking in. He seemed relieved, and after getting down, he regained his composure. The other dogs itself were not very stupid, and they would follow suit, and imitated him and took a look inside.Lu Gu and Shen Xuanqing turned their backs to them, and they didn't see this scene.Shen Xuanqing ran in the mountains for a day and didn't see Lu Gu all day. He also wanted to talk to fulang when he came back, so he thought of a word and asked, \"What are we eating today?\"Lu Gu seldom asked what he got, so he had to ask Lu Gu.He wasn't annoyed if Lu Gu didn't ask him, he was a timid character, and every time he took something out of the bamboo basket, Lu Gu would squat beside him, watched and listened carefully.As soon as he heard that rice wine needed to be cooked, Shen Xuanqing said: \"Then you cook it first, and I'll pick the rest and carry it back.\"In this case, Lu Gu obeyed and went back first, and saw Shen Xuanqing's big basket at the gate of the courtyard, He wanted to carry it by hand, but he didn't move after a while, it was so heavy that he had to give up.When the sky darkened, Lu Gu cooked the rice wine and put the food on the table. He was about to go out to call Shen Xuanqing for dinner when he saw him coming back with the peppercorns and bamboo baskets while driving the chickens and ducks.After a day of hard work, he was able to rest after closing the courtyard door. The black dirt on Lu Gu's hands couldn\u2019t be washed off after several times of washing with wild bath beads, but it could only slowly fade away. That was how it was when picking peppercorns. He was not in a hurry, just washed it and it would be clean in a few days.\"The fishes and shrimps in the river are getting fatter, and the loaches are fatter too. I won't go out tomorrow. I will cast a net by the river to catch some fish, then catch some purple belly and green snails, and take them down the mountain to sell in two days.\" Shen Xuanqing was still eating, he took a bite of scrambled eggs, and he was satisfied. There were not many eggs brought up the mountain this time, and they had eaten them twice. This time, there should be no more eggs.When it came to this season, some people said, \"When the autumn wind blows, the loach is fat, and the loach is better than the ginseng in early winter\". In the past few years, he had learned from the people in Fucheng that they paid attention to \"eating autumn\". Wild things were sold well in restaurants in the town. Why not sold it for some money, at this moment purple belly and green snails were quite expensive.Shen Xuanqing was tired of running around in the mountains and forests every day. He had no horses or carts, and only relied on two legs to run around. After a long time, people who were hard-pressed couldn't stand it. Now he didn\u2019t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0had to work hard to earn money, but also wanted to change jobs to rest your legs.The other one was his selfishness, he seemed to be getting more and more familiar with Lu Gu, but he could only see him when he came back at night, besides, he had never experienced what other people said about being newlyweds. Don't mention anything else, it was inevitable that he had some thoughts in his heart, and he wanted to spend more time with fulang.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 67": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Sweet Little FulangCH 35.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe dew washeavy in the morning, the mountains and forests were quiet, and there wasstill white mist when you got up early.After the sun came out, the mist dissipated quickly, gradually there wasmovement in the yard, Lu Gu and Shen Xuanqing both got up.\u00a0Last night, they boiled two large pots of water and they soaked in the bathtub one after the other to wash away their fatigue. they went to bed late because of the spring festival, so they got up later today.Hunting fresh fish and digging loach was also labor-intensive work. If you were full, you would get twice the result with half the effort. If Shen Xuanqing didn\u2019t go out in the morning, Lu Gu would cook rice porridge with his own hands.It was cold in the mountains, so they got up early and had a bowl of hot rice porridge, and their body waswarm after eating.Before going out, Lu Gu watched the sun came out and the mist subsided, and it was no longer damp, so he poured the four baskets of peppercorns he picked yesterday on the bamboo plaque to dry. Fortunately, there were only two trees, otherwise there would be too many and a bamboo mat would have to be used. It was cool in the mountains in summer, Shen Xuanqing didn't bring a bamboo mat at all, it was not easy to get it.The peppery smell spread out in the yard, and the two of them spread the peppercorns evenly with their hands. At the end, Lu Gu asked in a low voice, \"Is there a stone mortar here?\"After the peppercorns were dried, they could be pounded into powder with a stone mortar, and they were fried with salt.\"No, go back down the mountain and bring one up.\" Shen Xuanqing replied, Wei Lanxiang and Ji Qiuyue came up to pick the two peppercorns when they were ripe before, or he picked and brought them down the mountain by himself, and had never processed it in the mountains.Lu Gu nodded and said nothing more.After finishing these things, they went out with bamboo baskets and fishing nets on their backs. They also drove the chickens and ducks out to find something to eat outside the fence. You didn\u2019t need to worry about feeding them anymore, the grass outside was full of small bugs and they could eat them.Shen Xuanqing cast a good net in the gentle and deep stream, and moved many stones with Lu Gu to build a half-leg-high small dam to block the downstream water surface. The river water flowed out from the gaps in the stones, and both nets and stones could block the fishes, not to mention small ones, the big fishes could still be blocked by the stones.After the big net was cast, the large mesh could only stop the fat fishes, and other small fishes could hardly get blocked. The two of them set up another small net with dense mesh downstream, intending to catch some river prawns. The shelled river prawns were also bigger than in the summer.After finishing all these, Lu Gu followed Shen Xuanqing to the north forest behind the house. When he first came here, he heard Shen Xuanqing said that the north was dangerous, so he never got close to it.Walking to the north, there was a large dense forest, more than 30 miles away from here, which was not far away, but because there were wild boars there, and even the bear that the old hunter met came from the north, Shen Xuanqing had a lot of traps were dug in the forest in the north, several of them were big pits as deep as one person, and several rows of sharpened wooden wedges were buried under the pits.It was a good thing that Lu Gu didn't come here before, but now that he came, he pointed to the cut marks on several nearby trees, one on the top, one on the left, one on right which looked like the word \"\u53e3\".He told Lu Gu that once he saw these things in the mountains, he shouldn\u2019t go any further. There were traps or wild boar traps. Wasn\u2019t the traps were dug just for waiting for wild animals to fall.\u00a0This was a custom in their place. People who often went up the mountain knew about it, even Lu Gu knew it, but they had never seen it. The front mountain was full of small things, such as hares and pheasants. These years, they were rarely seen because people often catched them. So they were not going to set any traps.Shen Xuanqing would come to the north to look at it every few days. The day before yesterday, he saw nothing, and the dog didn't bark. There should be nothing falling in the traps, so he followed Lu Gu, who was carrying a bamboo basket to the hickory tree and picked the leaves.The leaves were a bit poisonous, mashed them up and pour the juice into the river to intoxicate the fish, the fish wouldn\u2019t die, they would turn their stomachs over, they would pass out and wake up after a while when the effect of the medicine wore off.\u00a0Besides hickory leaves, there was also a kind of Buddleia, but unfortunately it was not so easy to find, not as convenient as hickory leaves.they saw a lot of hickory nuts, this was autumn walnut, it would be ripe after a while, but Lu Gu didn\u2019t dare come to pick it alone, he was timid and cowardly, if he really encountered any wild boar, wolf or leopard, he might not even be able to run.But it was not a bad thing to cherish life sometimes, at least he wouldn't be worrying about walking around in the mountains.The leaves of the hickory tree were not very poisonous, so a lot of them had to be picked to be effective. The leaves in the bamboo basket were compacted, and when it was full, Shen Xuanqing carried it on his back.The two of them went to the river to crush the leaves with stones. After they were done, they poured the juice and debris into the river in the water area of the lower net. The green juice and broken leaves flowed in the water. Lu Gu stood by the river, he looked at it, but because the effect of the medicine hadn't taken effect, he didn't see a drunk fish, but a grass carp had already been caught in the net.Shen Xuanqing was not idle, anyway, he had to wait for a while, he carried a bamboo basket to dig loaches in the silt by the river, Lu Gu also followed, took off his shoes and socks, and rolled up his trousers very high.\"In less than a month, the rice in the paddy fields would be ripe, and then you could catch loaches , eels, and autumn rice fish in it, which were more delicious than fish in the river.\" Shen Xuanqing bent over and rummaged in the mud while talking, his hands were covered with mud.\"Yeah.\" Lu Gu listened beside him, and he also stretched out his hand to rummage in the mud. Fortunately, he and Shen Xuanqing were the only ones here, otherwise it would be fine if they were barefoot, but the trousers could never be pulled up so high.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In a short time, the two of them had caught eight loaches, and they were all fat and big.\"I'll make some soup tomorrow. It's easy to feed. It's not like fish. It turns over after being put in a bucket for a long time. It could survive for a while with mud and water. I used to raise it in a wooden bucket.\" Shen Xuanqing searched again. Talking to Lu Gu, stewing loach was indeed delicious and nourishing, so he had to make it for his fulang.While talking, the fish in the river gradually became drunk, no longer hiding at the bottom of the water, and swam to the surface to wag their tails, as if drunk, so this method of catching fish was called drunk fish, and some even turned white, it looked like a dead fish.Maybe there was no one to catch here, so there were quite a lot of fish. Lu Gu's eyes widened when he looked at the surface of the water. Surprise made his eyes brightened.This year's weather was so good and beautiful, even the aquatic plants were luxuriant, and the autumn fish ate and became fatter. This net was heavy to drag up, and even Shen Xuanqing had to put in a lot of effort.In the fishing net on the shore, the undrunk fish writhed and slapped their tails on the ground, but the drunk one didn\u2019t respond, because the water area where the drug was poured was long, and catching fishes with the net was not finished yet, Shen Xuanqing asked Lu Gu to go back to take wooden barrels, bamboo baskets and deep bamboo baskets, he jumped into the river and caught fish and threw them on the bank.Lu Gu ran back in a hurry, took the things and came back in a hurry, full of joy and busyness, the dog barked at the swaying fat fish, seeing so many fishes on the shore, the joy of harvesting a lot, unconsciously there was a smile on his face. for a while, he only felt the beauty of the mountains and rivers, and even the wind blowing by his ears while running was joyful and carefree.Shen Xuanqing scooped fishes in the water with a bamboo basket, and the river water seeped out from under the bamboo basket. Lu Gu also fished in the water with a larger, deeper bamboo basket. When one basket went into the water and then came out, there were several fishes fluttered in it.Today's harvest was beyond Shen Xuanqing's expectation. Hundreds of fish were thrown on the shore. Besides grass carp, there were also many more the expensive crucian carp and river eel, especially river eel, which was fattened in autumn, it could be stewed together with tofu, many people in the town liked to make this.He had never catched fishes this way in the mountains before. The journey was long, and the fishes were easy to die. On the way back, they had to be kept in water, which would only sink more. Besides, the Qingxi River flowed all the way down the mountain, and fish could be caught anywhere. He didn't expect to work hard to get a cart of fishes back to sell.Just now too many fishes appeared in front of him, he was still young after all, he got excited and jumped into the river and threw the fish on the bank.Now that he calmed down and took a look at the fat fish on the shore, he only went to catch river eels that were better and more expensive. Such a lot could sell for a lot of money. It was still early in the morning, and he could go down the mountain directly.Lu Gu originally thought he would be back in two days, but now that he said he would go down the mountain today, as a subordinate he worked even harder.Shrimps and small fishes were caught in the dense net, and Lu Gu threw the small fishes back into the river. The remaining white-shelled river prawns were so big and plentiful that they filled more than half of the fish basket.In order not to waste so many fishes, they used all three wooden barrels and two bamboo baskets to put the fishes on the cart, locked the door and went down the mountain.River eels were as easy to feed as loaches, and they were put in the bamboo baskets. The cheapest grass carp was also in the bamboo basket, and the rest of the more expensive fishes were in buckets. Even if the grass carp died after going back to the mountain road for two hours, that was the same. Today's fresh fishes were not afraid of people saying that it was dead fish and stinky fish. Because of the large quantity, it could be sold for a lot of copper coins at a low price, so it was considered a hard-earned money.Although they were in a hurry, both of them were inexplicably happy. Even if this carload of fishes couldn\u2019t be sold for five or eight taels, it was enough for two taels. Two taels of silver was also very good.Although Shen Xuanqing made money from hunting, but when he was unlucky and couldn't get anything, he could only bring a few hares down the mountain to exchange for some copper coins, so two taels of silver was by no means a small amount. Earning two taels of silver was pretty good.To make it easier for Shen Xuanqing to walk, Lu Gu carried the fish basket and a bamboo basket on his back, and put the heavy bamboo basket on the cart after walking for a certain distance.The road was bumpy, and a lot of water in the wooden barrels swayed out. Fortunately, most of the roads they walked were not far from the river, and they could replenish some water while walking.This kind of astonishment like unexpected joy was with Lu Gu, and seeing his fulang\u2019s eyes sparkling, seemed very happy, which made Shen Xuanqing felt good, tiredness was nothing, he still could move.Eighteen years old was too young, full of drive, they just went down the mountain in such a reckless manner, and when they arrived at the door, even Wei Lanxiang was surprised to see the cart full of fishes, seeing that they were out of breath, they seemed urgent on their way, she was a little dumbfounded, she couldn't do it like this with great strength, the bucket was heavy, she hurriedly let them go home to rest.Seeing that there were so many fish, Ji Qiuyue hurriedly went to the field to sell the fishes while they were still fresh, and asked his husband to pull the cart to sell the fish in the town.The author has something to say:Note: In reality, it\u2019s illegal to use hickory tree leaves to drug the fish, so don't do it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was past noon and the rest of the Shen family had already eaten. As soon as they asked, they said that they ate dry food on the way, and Wei Lanxiang hurried to the kitchen to cook.Shen Yaoqing and Ji Qiuyue came back from the field, saw so many fishes on the cart at the door of the house, shook their heads and smiled helplessly, these fishes plus water were heavy enough, thanks to the strength of the second boy, if it was others, they would get tired halfway down on the road.He came in and put down his hoe to greet Shen Xuanqing, Ji Qiuyue went to the house to get the scale, and the two of them pulled the cart to the town to sell fish. Most of the fishes except river eels and loaches turned white. For a long time, even if you went to the town, the dead fishes couldn't be sold at a good price.Even if you kept it at home, you couldn\u2019t keep too much. It would be a pity if you let it smell bad after two days, so he pulled the cart and drove it in the village. After passing through several villages, some of them could be sold by hawking along the way.After the water boiled, Wei Lanxiang poured two bowls of brown sugar water first, feeling sorry for both of them, this trip was really hard.The sweet brown sugar water was steaming, it was very hot at first sight, Lu Gu took a sip carefully after blowing on it.Wei Lanxiang glanced at the two of them from the kitchen window while chopping vegetables, and said with a smile: \"You two came back just in time, yesterday I fried some dried peppers and sliced meat, and fried a winter melon to eat \"Shen Yan came out with some freshly picked red dates, some of which were not yet fully red, half red and half green, these dates were picked by her at the third uncle's house, they were crisp and sweet, she just gave them to Lu Gu and Shen Xuanqing, she was called into the kitchen to help.\u00a0The fried dried chilies were stored in a large clay pot, and she took a bowl and a large spoon to scoop out a bowl.Dried chili was fried bright red and oily, cut into thin slices of lean meat the size of a thumbnail and mixed with it, fried spicy with dried chili, the meat slices and chili were both crunchy when they came out of the pan, put them in the jar. People who didn't know how spicy this dried chili couldn't stand it. On the contrary, the more you chewed it, the more delicious it became. The salt was also adequate. The fried meat were slightly salty and spicy.Before covering the pot, Shen Yan pinched some slicedmeat and chili for herself to eat, it was delicious.When Wei Lanxiang was heating the steamed buns, she put two eggs on the cage drawer, so she boiled them for a while longer. She took off the lid of the pot when the eggs were cooked, stuffed the steamed buns and eggs on the bowl, and scooped out the water from the big pot.The winter melon was so ripe, it didn't take long to fry it, Lu Gu and Shen Xuanqing also recovered after a while of rest, the dried chili was really fragrant, especially with rice, even Lu Gu ate a few more mouthfuls.After eating, Shen Yan washed the dishes and tidied up, Lu Gu followed Shen Xuanqing into the room, afraid of delaying time on the way, the fishes would all die and it would be worthless, so he was in a hurry to go out, Shen Xuanqing just pushed forward the cart, the rope tripped and rubbed his shoulders red, it was worn out and needed some medicine.Speaking of it, although the two of them got married, it was all at night. Once Shen Xuanqing took off his clothes, Lu Gu still didn't dare to look at him. It was also because of those things at night that he was still afraid, but at least he didn't tremble like the last time he applied the medicine.The broad back with clear texture looked strong, and Shen Xuanqing was tall. Lu Gu was usually afraid of him, but every time he went to the town or the mountains with Shen Xuanqing, he felt reliable for no reason.Outside, Shen Yan saw the fish basket with shrimps, called Guzi brother outside, and asked him what to do with the river shrimps. After the medicine was wiped off, Lu Gu didn't dare to touch it again, so he moved his hands and said: \" Okay, put it on, I'll go out and have a look first.\"Lu Gu carried the fish basket and put it under the eaves of the kitchen when he entered the house. Shen Yaoqing forgot to take it when he left. Lu Gu washed the medicine on his hands and squatted in front of the fish basket with Shen Yan. There were two white-shelled shrimps in his hands. These shrimps were quite big. It had been a long time since they were caught, and they were not jumping around now.After Shen Xuanqing dressed up he came out, Lu Gu asked him what he wanted, since he forgot to bring it, and this thing couldn't be kept for a long time, they might as well eat it by themselves at night.Such big prawns could only be found in the deep mountains. Shen Yan could rarely catched them in the river outside the village. When she heard that she could eat braised prawns, she was so happy that she poured water and began to wash them.Wei Lanxiang fed the chickens and ducks and came out of the backyard. Seeing Shen Xuanqing sitting in the yard chopping firewood, she said, \"Erqing, don't be so reckless in the future, the fishes are not easy to carry. If you rush too fast, you will hurt yourself.\"She was a bit worried, because Shen Shunfu didn't make it through when he was seeing a doctor, in addition to being too cold for too long and hurting his roots, the doctor also said that he was too strong when he was young, and he worked hard like old cow without rest, country people didn't eat that well, and didn't know how to recuperate. People often said that overwork could lead to illness, but it was just that they didn't see it when they were young , not until they were middle-aged.How could it be so easy to walk on a rough mountain road for more than two hours, and to pull a cart?\u00a0It was also that the country people had no other way to make money. It was good to have a hunting skill to earn money and lived a good life. Although it was better than other farmers, it was still a labor-intensive job.\u00a0Now there was no need to rush to pay off the debt, but to take a break.Shen Xuanqing knew her worry, he kept working, and said: \"Mother, I know, there is no need to worry. I will rest for two days when I come back this time, and I won't be in a hurry. Take it easy.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Lu Gu and Wei Lanxiang went to the third uncle's house. There were a lot of shrimp in the fish basket, so they sent some over. When they came back, they didn't have an empty hand. they borught half a bag of dates in the third uncle's courtyard.Wei Lanxiang asked the two of them to take them up the mountain to eat. If they couldn't finish eating too much, they would wilt, so they might as well dried them in the sun. The dried dates would also help Lu Gu replenished his energy and blood. First, listen to Langzhong\u2019s words, and the dried dates he bought had already been eaten. Fortunately, the Shen family didn\u2019t treat people badly when they ate, and they often ate meat and fish, and Lu Gu had no other problems. He ate and drank well and slept well, so his body was naturally stronger than before.Shen Yan came back with a bundle of grass, but Dahui was not tied after he went down the mountain, so he followed her when she went out, and also entered the courtyard gate.Seeing that Wei Lanxiang and Lu Gu came back, she said, \"Mother, I met Caixia just now, she came down from the mountain and said that their family went to the mountain to pick up chestnuts and hazelnuts, and Caixia alone carried more than half of the basket. \"After autumn, when the chestnuts and hazelnuts were ripe and fell to the ground, not only people would pick them up, but also the mice and squirrels in the mountains would pick them up for the winter. Several villages near would go up the mountains to pick them up. When there were more people, everyone would pick them up, each family could pick up less, Caixia's family picked up a lot, Shen Yan was naturally surprised to see it.Chestnuts and hazelnuts were dried and could be eaten in winter. There were few vegetables in winter, and Shen Xuanqing wouldn\u2019t go into the mountains after the heavy snow. The only meat was bacon and dried meat. The villagers could make more food for winter.Wei Lanxiang was plucking onions in the courtyard and was about to make dinner. She said without raising her head when she heard that, \"What's so unusual about this? Didn't your second elder brother always pick it up for you in the deep forest? Or do you want to go to pick chestnuts?\"There were many people in Qianshan, but there were few things. Shen Xuanqing could pick up a lot in the deep mountains. Chestnuts and hazelnuts could be picked up by everyone in the mountains, and they were sold cheaply in the town. Ji Qiuyue would bring them to town when autumn came two years ago. Shen Yan went to pick it up, selling more and selling less would be money, not to mention repaying debts, at least it could maintain the family's livelihood, and it could also be used as winter rations.They not only picked up in front of the mountain, but also went to the mountain with Shen Xuanqing, and picked up more in the deep forest, but Shen Yan rarely went there, only once last year, she was only eleven this year, and the small mountain road was too long to walk, When they came back, they had to carry bamboo baskets, so Wei Lanxiang would go with Ji Qiuyue, and Shen Yaoqing, who had to work in the field and couldn't go, would make do at home to cook.Going to the mountain to pick up chestnuts was interesting for Shen Yan. It was more fun than driving ducks and hunting chicken grass. After selling it, the money was her own, and the family wouldn\u2019t want it. It didn't matter if it was only five copper coins or ten copper coins. It would crackling when you put it in her own small money bag, which was very nice.\"Mother, do you want to go?\" Shen Yan didn't say that he really wanted to go, but her expression showed everything.Wei Lanxiang was peeling the onions, and she looked over when she heard her say that, and said with a smile: \"You can talk about it if you want to go, what are you doing with your mother?\"She thought for a while and said: \"But it's really good to pick chestnuts. We will keep some more this year, and we\u2019ll eat it differently during the winter. In the past few years, we\u2019ve steamed it with rice, but this time we\u2019re bored with it, so let\u2019s cook it with chicken, and it\u2019s said to be more delicious, so let\u2019s try it too.\u201dShe walked towards the kitchen, and said: \"Your brother Erqing is resting at home these few days, don't rush away, let's go around the front hill first.\"Shen Yan was happy when she heard it, and said to Lu Gu: \"Brother Guzi, do you want to go or not? Let's go together.\"When Lu Gu listened to the two of them talking, he also remembered the chestnuts that Shen Xuanqing picked up for him last time, and there were still some unfinished chestnuts. In the mountains, before he went down the mountain, he wanted to pick some, but these days he was busy with other things and didn't find any time, so he nodded and agreed.The three of them were talking in the yard, and Shen Xuanqing came out after lying down in the room for a while, and ate a few dates.When Shen Yaoqing and Ji Qiuyue came back, it was already dark, and they were quite capable, watching the sun go to the west, and there were still some fishes left, so they took the cart to the restaurant and told them what fishes they caught today, yes, even if they were dead, they were still fresh, not to mention the half-dead ones in the bucket, which were even fresher, because the fishes were big and fat, as well as crucian carp and river eel, and finally sold them to a restaurant at a cheap price, as long as they were sold, they wouldn\u2019t lose money.After they came back, there were only two small river eels left in the cart fish, which were specially reserved. After autumn, these things were stewed and nourishing. , If you wanted to eat it, you had to make up for it now.The money for selling the fishes was given to Shen Xuanqing, and the copper coins and the scattered silver added up to two taels of silver. This day they earned two taels, and the hardship of the journey was worth it.There were stewed prawns and fried chili meat slices, both of which could be served with wine. Shen Yaoqing brought out the wine, and not only his brothers drank it, but Ji Qiuyue and Wei Lanxiang also tasted a small cup. There was meat and wine, the whole family was chatting and laughing, even if Lu Gu didn't drink, the fried chili would make his cheeks blush and his body warm.He listened and watched, even if he didn't speak and just listened to others, he was happy. A kind of hope gradually appeared in his eyes, looking forward to living such a happy and harmonious life forever.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When reached the forest, the crowd dispersed, so they couldn't see them anymore. Sometimes, they could hear parents shouting to the wild boy to stop messing around. There was a vague movement of running.Shen Xuanqing followed. Originally, Wei Lanxiang was thinking about him walking on the mountain road yesterday and refused to let him follow. He said that if something happened or Shen Yan and Lu Gu couldn't carry it, they would have to call him.Lu Gu was also tired yesterday, and Wei Lanxiang didn't let him carry the bamboo basket today, he picked it up with Shen Yan and put it in Shen Yan's basket, even this may not be able to fill it up, people in several villages had gone to the mountain to pick up chestnuts.When the days were better, you didn\u2019t have to rush to pick them up before others when you went to the mountain. The five of them could walk more slowly. They found a cluster of edible mushrooms, and quickly picked them and put them into a bamboo basket.Shen Yan was a girl, and she was young. She didn\u2019t dare to go to the mountain by herself without being accompanied. At most, she dug wild vegetables and collected mushrooms on the hillside not far from her home, but people often passed by there. There were wild vegetables, but there were not many mushrooms, so when she picked up a bunch at this moment, she was naturally happy.Lu Gu had never been to the mountains of Qingxi Village before, but the Shen family often came here and knew where the chestnut trees were, so he just followed.\u00a0Usually he was used to carry the bamboo basket on his back, but there was nothing on his back today, which made him felt much lighter.Their house was the closest to the mountain, and they came out quite early. When they arrived at the chestnut forest, there were two figures in the distance. They were from the same village. Wei Lanxiang greeted through the trees, and the other party also smiled back then continued to pick up things.Ripe chestnuts fell on the ground, Lu Gu bent down to pick up a few, and he had to search under the fallen leaves in the grass. Someone picked it up here, but there were not many things. They walked into the woods while picking up.Picking it up, Lu Gu came to the side, unable to hold the chestnuts in his hand, he looked up and saw that Shen Yan was about ten steps away, and just as he was about to go over, he heard Shen Xuanqing speak.\"Give it to me, you pick up yours, and I'll put it away if you have any more.\" Shen Xuanqing took the chestnuts he was holding in both hands, and held them with the hem of his clothes, so that he didn't have to occupy his hands. He followed Lu Gu all the time, nothing to worry about.As soon as he turned his head, he could see Shen Xuanqing picking up chestnuts beside him. He put the chestnuts that he couldn't hold on Shen Xuanqing's clothes, which made Lu Gu felt unexplainable. He simply didn\u2019t think about it, and concentrated on picking chestnuts.Shen Yan came over with a bamboo basket, Shen Xuanqing poured all the chestnuts in his clothes into it, and walked forward with Lu Gu, there were indeed not many things here, he saw many in the deep forest that day, but he was busy hunting so he just picked up some for Lu Gu to eat.When passing by a water bun tree, it was covered with red fruits, the fruit was bigger than an adult's finger, and could be stuffed into his mouth. Shen Yan pointed to the tree and said to Lu Gu: \"Brother Guzi, this was bitter buns, you could\u2019t eat them.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d Lu Gu nodded, thinking of the sweet bun tree he found, he said, \u201cI found the sweet ones in the mountains, and I wanted to bring you some. But I was\u00a0in a hurry to go down the mountain yesterday, so I didn\u2019t have time to pick it.\u201d\u201cThen you bring me some next time.\u201d Shen Yan was not polite to him, sweet buns were scarce, and when she heard that Lu Gu had found them, she was very rare and wanted to eat them, she said: \"Look at whether my mother would go to the mountains to pick up chestnuts in two days. If she go, I will go with you too. You just tell me where the sweet buns, and I can pick them back for us by myself. I will pick a lot of them. Well, I still want to bring it back to brother Daqing to eat.\"When Lu Gu heard her said this, it seemed as if she had found the sweet buns, and she wanted to pick a lot of them back. Such childish but serious words made him unable to help but bend his eyes slightly, revealing a very faint smile, he nodded in agreement.\"Shen Yan, come quickly, there were raspberries to eat.\" Ji Qiuyue shouted from the front, and she walked to the side of the chestnut forest. A dwarf raspberry tree with small fruit hanging from it, already red.As soon as Shen Yan heard this, she hurried over. These three dwarf raspberry plants had traces of being picked by someone else. The remaining green fruits should be ripe again. There were only a dozen fruits in total. She picked one and tasted one, sweet and sour, this kind of berry was a bit small, not enough to fill a mouthful.She divided the picked fruits, Shen Xuanqing and Wei Lanxiang didn't want it, Ji Qiuyue tasted two, Lu Gu didn't eat much, and gave her the rest.The whole family wandered around the mountain all morning, and they didn't go back until noon when it was time to eat. Shen Yan carried half a basket of chestnuts, and Wei Lanxiang and Ji Qiuyue had about the same amount in their bamboo baskets, not many, but they also picked some mushrooms. With the wild fruit, fried the mushrooms when you went back, and ate them while they were still fresh.Shen Yan took a bunch of mountain flowers in her hand, she walked with Lu Gu, and said: \"Brother Guzi, I went to the town and saw someone selling flowers on the street, I should be able to sell these if I pick them, that is our\u00a0place is a bit far from the town, so we have to go there in the morning, and we won\u2019t be able to sell it if it\u2019s dry at noon.\u201dLu Gu nodded in agreement, when he went to the town with Shen Xuanqing, he also saw someone selling flowers, the beautiful and fresh ones were expensive, and he followed Shen Xuanqing into the mountains. If he saw beautiful mountain flowers in the mountains, he could pick them up and bring them back but they would dead on the way. It was not as cost-effective as dried wolfberries and wild bath beads.As Shen Yan said, her heart came alive. The next time Mother took her to the town to sell duck eggs, she would pick some flowers and planted them in the yard, when the time came, maybe she could sell them for some copper coins too.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The sun was hot for a long time, so he moved to a cool place under the eaves.Lu Gu collected the eggs from the backyard and put them away in the kitchen. Seeing him chopping firewood, he paused at the door of the kitchen, hesitantly approached, and squatted on the ground to collect the chopped firewood. But before he picked them up, he looked up at Shen Xuanqing.\"What?\" Shen Xuanqing asked subconsciously.Then Lu Gu said anxiously: \"Can you go up the mountain tomorrow, the chickens and ducks are still on the mountain.\"His voice was very small, and his voice still sounded a little trembling, which showed how nervous he was.When they came back yesterday, they drove the chickens and ducks back to the yard, and put a lot of grass and chaff for them to peck at themselves. Lu Gu was careful, so he put the hay nest in the leeward place and covered it with a bamboo basket, and put the firewood on the bamboo basket. Under the mouth of the basket, there was a slanted opening. Chickens and ducks were used to sleeping in hay nests at night, and they would squeeze in by themselves when the night was cold. Now that they have grown up, they were fluffy and huddled together, and they wouldn\u2019t freeze to death.But this time he went down the mountain in a hurry, which made Lu Gu felt uncertain. It would be fine for a day or two. If he went down the mountain for a long time, he wouldn\u2019t be at ease. He thought for a while before he dared to discuss with Shen Xuanqing, but it's not that he didn't hear the words between him and Wei Lanxiang, afraid that Shen Xuanqing didn't have a good rest, he swallowed in fear, and said carefully: \"Then we will leave the day after tomorrow. You rest when we go to the mountain, and I will cook and work.\"Counting back yesterday, today the chickens and ducks had only been in the mountains alone for a day, and they put a lot of grass, so it was not impossible to go back the day after tomorrow.Shen Xuanqing knew before that he was very rare about those chickens and ducks, and seeing that he wanted to go back but was timid, he nodded and said: \"Then go up tomorrow, and rest at home was also resting.\"Hearing this, Lu Gu was very grateful in his heart, and said thanks repeatedly, he was so grateful and joyful that he didn\u2019t know what to say. He picked up the bundle of fine firewood and put it into the firewood room. Shen Xuanqing was working, but he didn\u2019t dare to rest. He sat by the side and waited for Shen Xuanqing to chop the firewood and he pick it up and put it in the woodshed.As soon as Wei Lanxiang came out of the room, she saw the two of them under the eaves, one chopping firewood and the other holding firewood. They really looked like a young couple who were used to their daily lives, so she didn't bother them much, and went out.Shen Xuanqing originally frowned slightly because Lu Gu was too afraid of him and he felt uncomfortable, and he didn't know what to do to dispel this fear, but who knew that Lu Gu didn't leave, and sat beside him, obediently, all of a sudden it made him abandon other thoughts, and his star pupils were stained with a smile.When he was happy, his thoughts changed a little bit. He thought to himself, and felt that although Lu Gu was still afraid of him, he didn't just nod and say yes like before, and didn't dare to have any objections. He told him today that he wanted to go to the mountain early, anyway, he dare to speak, he thought that he was not as afraid of him like before.\"I'll go for three or five days at most, you didn\u2019t need to cook anymore, go to Uncle's house for a meal, and I'll make it for you when I come back.\"Ji Qiuyue called Shen Yaoqing into the kitchen, lifted the lid of the cage and she explained that the steamed buns and pancakes were all inside, and he could warm them up if he wanted to eat them. There was still some rice wine at home, and if he could\u2019nt make rice porridge, he could make rice wine to drink. With these, he wouldn\u2019t be hungry if he was hungry.\"Sure, I see. I'll take the remaining river eel over there, buy a few more pieces of tofu, and bring it over for my third aunt to cook. I'll eat it for the next few days.\" Shen Yaoqing didn't take the matter of eating to heart, and mentioned that somethings could be eaten for two or three days in the past, without him having to do it himself.When Ji Qiuyue heard the same thing, she said, \"It's fine, you go and eat, and I will get a basket of chestnuts for my third aunt when I come back.\"Before the dew dried up early, the sun came out from the east like a salted egg yolk, Shen Xuanqing pulled the empty cart, he went into the mountain with Lu Gu, Wei Lanxiang and the others.There were many people entering the mountain this time, and the journey was even more lively. Even the dogs were a little excited, running and barking, and wagging their tails.Ji Qiuyue spoke briskly, and Wei Lanxiang was not rigid and mean. She had become familiar with the eldest daughter-in-law after three years, chatting and laughing along the way, and Shen Yan interrupted from time to time. Lu Gu listened to the commotion.\u00a0\u00a0They rested for a while, he went to pick mountain flowers with Shen Yan, and felt that even the journey was shortened.When he got to the mountain, Lu Gu went to the backyard as soon as he opened the door. The chickens and ducks were fine, but after for two days, the fence in the backyard was a little dirty. He took a shovel and started to tidy up, shoveling up the excrement and dirt on the ground into a pile Heap it up, he would find some green medicine leaves later, at least to smoke the smell and it would be cleaner.Wei Lanxiang saw that the courtyard and the kitchen were neatly tidied up, which was much more tidy than when Shen Xuanqing was alone, and she knew that Lu Gu was diligent, and she had more smiles on her face.She was hungry after walking for so long, so she and Ji Qiuyue cooked in the kitchen first.When Lu Gu came out from the backyard, seeing that he couldn't help in the kitchen, he went to the east room to sweep and make their beds.Shen Yan followed him in to help. The bed in the east room was quite big, and the three of them could squeeze together to make do with it. It was cold on the mountain, but it was warm enough to squeeze together at night.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Gray-brown squirrels came down from the trees to look for food, stuffed the chestnuts into their mouths and bring them back to their nests to store it for the winter.\u00a0Not only squirrels, mice and voles also hid the chestnuts and hazelnuts in their holes.There were quite a lot of these things in the deep\u00a0\u00a0forest, and people had to pick them up quickly while there were still on the ground, otherwise they would either break or be taken back by them.It was the first time for Lu Gu to come to this chestnut grove, and he saw a layer of hairy chestnuts on the ground, which was much more than the previous mountain, so he took off the bamboo basket and began to pick it up, picking the heavy ones, the flesh of the chestnuts inside was watery and sweet, the small ones didn\u2019t matter if it was light, it would be better to fill the basket after a while, and when he picked it up, there were ripe chestnuts that fell from the tree and landed on the ground with a clatter.When they came, they brought the dogs along, and squirrels and voles hid vigilantly early on, occasionally poking their heads out of trees or holes. They were very cautious and looked at those with people with bad eyes.Shen Xuanqing saw a squirrel with a big tail in the tree, but he didn't hit it, he just bent down to pick the chestnuts, but two small dogs were sniffing around in the woods, or digging holes, in the hole a mouse could be heard screaming, but it didn\u2019t escape the pursuit of the dogs, and even the hazelnuts and chestnuts stored in the hole were dug out.Hearing the movement, Shen Xuanqing saw that there was a fat field mouse in the dog's mouth, not the slender and annoying mouse, so he stopped caring about the small dogs and roasted it for them later.\u00a0As for the things in the field mouse hole, no one took them, there were so many on the ground.Like the things in the mouse hole, they usually dug out when there was nothing to eat, or if they couldn\u2019t find chestnuts in the mountain, there would be children and dogs to dig the hole. Anyway, they had to be shelled, so took them back and washed them, It didn't get dirty after washing.Children were greedy and playful, and digging holes was fun. As for adults, these squirrels and voles in the mountains had to spend the winter, they wouldn\u2019t starve to death since it was not a famine year, and there was no shortage of food, so let them have a way to survive.The five people carried five bamboo baskets and two big sacks. They filled them up after picking them in the\u00a0\u00a0grove for a long time. In such a large grove of chestnuts, there were still some chestnuts that hadn\u2019t fallen from the trees. They were the only ones here to pick them up. One time was enough for them this year, and they didn\u2019t have to worry about whether the squirrels were enough to eat.Except for the one on Shen Yan's back, the bamboo baskets were all big bamboo baskets, which were quite heavy when they were full, and they had to take turns carrying the sacks. Shen Xuanqing carried the bamboo baskets on his back and carried the sacks, it was even heavier, and they had to rest after walking for a while. Wei Lanxiang and the others were used to pick up in the mountains, so they didn\u2019t think it was too rare, but Lu Gu was different.When he was in Lu's house, he would follow Lu Daxiang and the others to pick up chestnuts, but after taking them back, he didn't eat much. He only ate it in the hillside when Du Hehua sent him out to look for them, everyone in the village went to pick chestnuts, and he could find few, but at least chestnuts didn\u2019t need to be roasted or boiled, they could be eaten after peeling. He still liked autumn very much, when chestnuts and wild fruits were ripe , could satisfy his hunger, so that his chest wouldn\u2019t stick to his back.So even though the bamboo basket was so heavy, he was very happy, the more he found, the more he could eat.The chestnut\u00a0\u00a0grove was far away from the courtyard. They set off in the morning and returned in the middle of the afternoon. They couldn't run around in the mountains. It would be dangerous if they went far and didn\u2019t come back at night, so they only picked chestnuts today.\"It's a good day this year. There are so many wild chestnuts. Let's take rest for today. Tomorrow, we will go pick the hazelnuts. We will pull the cart over and push them back together, otherwise it will be too heavy with only bamboo basket\u201d Wei Lanxiang said while rubbing her shoulders.\"That's right, it's better to take the cart tomorrow.\" Ji Qiuyue also said, they didn't pick up so many last year and the year before, they were only full of bamboo baskets and a sack, but the year before was about the same as this year.After Lu Gu put down the bamboo basket, he went to scoop up water to wash everyone's dirty hands.After resting and eating, seeing Shen Yan coming slowly, he asked her if she would go pick wild bath beads. After washing his hands just now, there were only three left in the small basket, not too far from the yard there was a big wild bath bead tree, from which he picked the ones he sold in the town before.They were going out to pick wild bath beads, Shen Xuanqing took the dogs and followed, leaving Wei Lanxiang and Ji Qiuyue resting in the room.After all, Shen Yan was young, and her legs didn't feel tired after recovering. Picking wild bath beads was just for fun for her, so she was naturally happy.The sun was heading to the west, but it was not evening yet. About a quarter of an hour later, they arrived under the wild bath bead tree. Lu Gu, even the short Shen Yan went to pick the wild bath bead.They picked the bigger wild bath beads. Shen Xuanqing didn't climb the tree, so he stood under the tree and took a basket to pick them up. He was tall, and it was very convenient to lift his arms up. Lu Gu could pick it with Shen Yan and throw it into the basket.The wild bath beads were round, like a fruit, but they were not red. They were green from fruiting to falling. The bath beads that fell on the ground were too ripe to rub out the white foam that could clean the hands and hair. So no one would pick it from the ground, only from the tree.This tree was big, and the wild bath beads it produced were also big, only smaller than quail eggs, and one could last for two days, so Lu Gu sold them well before.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After picking more than half of the basket, they went back, as long as they had enough for their use, they would pick it again later for sell.In the early morning of the next day, they went to the hazelnuts grove again. This time they brought on the cart, and when they came back, they also had a good harvest. In addition to the hazelnuts, they also had a basket of pine nuts and a lot of mushrooms.This thing was not available every year, because the trees were too tall, and pine cones were often knotted on the treetops. It was dangerous to climb up the tree, the treetops were towering, and the wind in the mountains was even more dangerous, even his life was gone.Shen Xuanqing was not a picker of pine cones. In the previous years, most of them were picked under the trees. There was a lot of wind in the mountains, and a strong wind could blow down the ripe pine cones. But like chestnuts and hazelnuts, squirrels and other small animals could also pick them up, so there were not many.There were quite a lot of mushrooms, and they couldn\u2019t finish them. They could sell what they could sell when they went down the mountain.With Lu Gu and the others pushing behind the cart, it was easy for Shen Xuanqing to pull the cart. Normally, he and Lu Gu went up and down the mountain together, without Ji Qiuyue and Shen Yan. Thanks to the large number of people they came up to the mountain this time, otherwise it would be heavy to carry so many things home.Wei Lanxiang and the others spent four days on the mountain, even rushing to pick up things. On the fourth day, they packed up the cart early in the morning and were about to go down the mountain.\u00a0they left some chestnuts and hazelnuts for Lu Gu and Shen Xuanqing, so they didn\u2019t have to run to pick them up anymore, there were so many.Before setting off, Shen Xuanqing fed the three dogs meat, patted Dahui's neck, and told them to go down the mountain first.Ji Qiuyue also came over and said something more, let them go to Shen Yaoqing, Dahui was smart and like a human, he ran away first with two small dogs, Ji Qiuyue was still muttering in the yard, saying how she felt Dahui seemed to really understandd.Shen Xuanqing usually didn\u2019t call Shen Yaoqing to pick him up, after all there was work in the field, and sometimes Shen Yaoqing had to go to the town to do part time job to earn money, but this time before going up the mountain, because his mother and Ji Qiuyue both came, Shen Yaoqing remembered his father who suffering from a serious illness when he was young, he said that the things he wanted were too heavy, and he would help him take them back halfway. The dogs knew the mountain road and the house, and as long as the dogs ran back, he would know what it means.During the day, when the sun came out, there were few wild animals on the way down the mountain, so it didn't matter if there were no dogs. Besides, there were so many of them, so they didn't have to be so afraid on the road.After half a way on the mountain road, they finally saw Shen Yaoqing, and three dogs followed him. These three dogs were hunting dogs. They were good at running, and they were used to run with Shen Xuanqing in the mountains. When they saw people going up the mountain, they followed him again, but looking at the way they stick out their tongues, Shen Xuanqing knew that they would lie on their stomachs when they went back.\"So many.\" Shen Yaoqing came over to see the cart and was delighted.Since they stopped here, they decided to rest for a while. It happened that this place was not far from the river, and the three dogs all ran to drink water. There was still water in the bamboo tube on the cart, so they shared it.\"I met Da Chen yesterday, and said that the dog cub in Niujia village was out of the moon, and it can be brought back in the next few days.\" Shen Yaoqing ate two sweet buns brought by Shen Yan, and sat down with him while eating.Shen Xuanqing said \"I'll be there tomorrow.\"Before he asked someone to inquire about a suitable wolf pup in Niujia village, the price had been agreed, and he himself calculated that it would need two months. He had seen the bitch, good-looking and smart, and the family also knew how to raise the dogs. After the puppies were weaned, the bitch would take care of them for a few days and taught them. It would be more humane and easier to raise.\"Do you still want a dog?\" Wei Lanxiang asked while sitting beside him.When Shen Xuanqing first started raising the dogs, she saw her son fed the dogs with meat and bones, which made her felt distressed. People in the countryside always fed the dogs with leftovers, and then boiled the wheat bran for them to eat, or the dogs just went out to look for food, and it was rare to feed it so well, even if it was wild rabbit meat, it would be distressing.Shen Xuanqing told her that keeping a dog was for hunting, if you didn\u2019t eat well, how could you run, what\u2019s more, the mountains and groves were dangerous, and the dog was full of momentum, so he could feel at ease with them, and after talking about it once or twice, Wei Lanxiang gave up , but when she heard that he still needed to raise another pup, she couldn't help but ask one more question.\"Now the two of us were on the mountain, I take the dog out, and I worry about Lu Gu walking outside alone.\" Shen Xuanqing explained that he had already decided to adopt the pup, and no matter what the rest of the family said, he wouldn\u2019t change his mind.How could Wei Lanxiang didn\u2019t know his temperament, just by looking at his expression, she knew that this pup would have to be brought back tomorrow, but that was true, she also worried about Lu Gu being alone on the mountain, so she just raised his head, nodded and said: \"Yes that's right.\"Lu Gu didn't know that he was asking about puppies before, and he was stunned for a moment when he heard his name, and then he realized that he had never raised puppies, so he didn't feel much in his heart at the moment. Dahui and the others came back from drinking water, wondering what kind of puppies they were.Firstly, there were many people here, and secondly, he was also timid, so he didn't ask Shen Xuanqing.After taking a rest, Shen Yaoqing put a rope on his shoulders, and it was his turn to pull the cart, while Shen Xuanqing and the other five pushed the cart behind.\"Brother Daqing, now is different, much lighter than before.\" Shen Yan pushed the cart and said, even Lu Gu nodded, it was indeed easier to push.Men who had been doing farm work all year round had the strength to handle it. Shen Yaoqing also went to the town to carry large bags for work from time to time, so he naturally had the strength to pull a cart.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

From a distance, it looked small. It really looked like the flat boat that people said. Both people and poultry needed to rely on the boats to cross the river.There was a bridge in the narrow section of the stream, this bridge was called Liangzhang Bridge, Lu Gu walked across the bridge with Shen Xuanqing carrying a small bamboo basket on his back.Niujia village was on the other side of the Qingxi River, far away. It took almost 35 minutes to walk along the river bank to the Liangzhang Bridge. Most of the villages and towns here were built along the river. Fork the road and turn to the southwest avenue, followed the avenue, Fenggu Town was in the front, but after getting off the bridge, according to what Shen Xuanqing said, you would reach Niujia village after one more village.There was a flood of people on and off the bridge, peddlers carrying loads and yelling, there were needles, threads, knives, groceries, fruit, cakes, and biscuits. The woman with the basket led the child, and the child stretched out his hand to eat candied haws, and his arm was grabbed by the woman and they hurried down the bridge.The bearer carried a small sedan chair onto the bridge from the opposite side, and the curtain of the sedan chair window was gently pushed aside, and the fulang sitting in the sedan chair looked out.The gray-haired but elegant old lady wore a black embroidered forehead band on her forehead. She was riding a donkey led by a half-grown boy in the front, and the donkey's hooves pattered to her house.Liangzhang Bridge was similar to the bustle of the town. There was a big market on the first and fifteenth day of the Lunar New Year, and people from all over the world would come to the market to buy and sell things.The ships on both sides of the bridge were unloading. Shen Xuanqing used to carry large bales and unload timber here, so he was quite familiar with the surrounding area.The candied haws seller passed by with a pile of wood on his shoulders. Lu Gu had never been to Fenggu Town for few times before, let alone come here. He was watching curiously, when he heard Shen Xuanqing yelling to stop the candied haws seller.Seeing a customer coming to ask, the peddler grinned and asked courteously: \"A string is three copper coin, how many strings do you want?\"\"One string is fine, pick a big one.\" Shen Xuanqing took out a new purse embroidered with tiger patterns from his bosom. It was sewn by Lu Gu when he was free these days. It was given to him the night before, and when he went out today, just put it on.\"Okay.\" As soon as the peddler collected the money, he took a piece from the pile. The size of his pile was fairly uniform, otherwise it would be difficult to sell if he was picked on.Shen Xuanqing put the purse in his arms, but didn't intend to take it, so the peddler handed it to Lu Gu.There were eight red fruit wrapped in sugar syrup. People often sold this thing in the streets and alleys of the town, but country people didn\u2019t buy it easily. Where they got so much spare money? Besides, it was a favorite food for children, and some adults still hated the sour of hawthorn.The peddler left, Lu Gu looked up at Shen Xuanqing with the sticks of candied haws in his hand, his eyes worried and cautious.\"Let's eat.\" Shen Xuanqing said.A bunch of candied haws was not a precious thing. Liangzhang bridge was like a small fair. It was nothing to buy a snack for his fulang. When he was young, he went to the fair with his family to eat delicious food. When he went to the big market he bought what he loved the most and when he returned to the village he ate it together with his peers.For the country folks whose circumstances were not bad, it seemed necessary to go to the market to buy something that they didn't usually eat.Shen Xuanqing walked down the bridge, Lu Gu took a half step behind and followed him, he hesitated before biting into the red fruit on the top, it was wrapped in sugar syrup and very sweet, the bit of the flesh of the fruit was sour, he tasted it and thought it was not good to eat alone, so he turned his head and asked in a low voice: \"Do you want to eat?\"Before he finished speaking, the candied haws were passed to Shen Xuanqing.\"No, you eat.\" Shen Xuanqing didn't like candied haws very much.After the two got off the bridge, it was still bustling. The fortune-teller who set up a stall twisted his beards to explain his hexagrams, and all kinds of snacks were fragrant. There were many people sitting in the tavern and teahouse. When he saw the pancakes seller, Shen Xuanqing paused and went to buy it, he \u00a0ordered two pancakes, which cost six copper coins.The hot shortbread was wrapped with a small piece of oil paper, and could be eaten in the hand. The pancake was not big, but it was better since it was oily, crispy and soft. Shen Xuanqing gave one to Lu Gu, and the other one was settled by himself in three bites.With something to eat in both hands, Lu Gu didn't know which one to eat first. After making a choice, he finished the pancake first, otherwise it would be cold.He couldn't help looking at Shen Xuanqing when he was eating, even when his mother was around, he never bought him two delicious foods once, filling both hands.After being cautiously startled, an indescribable joy surged up, making his eyes brighten when he looked at Shen Xuanqing, but gradually, there was an inexplicable sourness quietly permeating his heart and eye sockets, he never thought that there would be someone who treated him as well as his mother and bought more things than his mother.So when Shen Xuanqing turned his head, he saw that his little fulang\u2019s eyes were wet, showing a bit of pity. He was shocked, but he couldn't figure it out. He didn't know what happened, why he cried, and asked immediately: \"What's wrong? Why are you crying?\"Hearing this, Lu Gu shook his head subconsciously, meaning it was nothing. He thought for a while before saying, \"It's a little sour.\"Shen Xuanqing glanced at the candied haws he was about to eat in his hand, and felt relieved. You couldn\u2019t buy this one next time, the hawthorn could make people shed tears, he said: \u201cDon\u2019t eat it if it\u2019s too sour.\u201dLu Gu\u2019s sourness was the sourness in his heart, but he didn\u2019t know how to express his emotions. He still felt embarrassed when he say it, and he was afraid of being scolded as a mourning ghost. In addition, those emotions would be broken as soon as he opened his mouth. He was too embarrassed to explain. He had to say it quickly: \"It's not sour, there's only one left.\"Shen Xuanqing thought it was a pity for him, but he couldn't grab it and threw it away, so he didn't say anymore.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The bitch was lying in the front yard, and four puppies were playing around her. After a while, one of the puppies wanted to get into her belly to breastfeed. The bitch got up and left without letting it to eat.Thirty-something-year-old Niu Hong was smoking a cigarette, and caught the biggest pup over, saying, \"Just this little pup, take it home so that it can be raised and keep it healthy.\"The pup was plump, He pinched the back of the neck and lifted it up. His eyes were bright, and he made a lot of whimpering noises. His limbs were thick and fat, and his claws were not small.the little pup was a male pup, Shen Xuanqing thought his appearance was very good, and he would feel relieved if it could follow Lu Gu when he grew up, so he gave Niu Hong one tael of silver, mastiff like this was more expensive than other dogs , but worth it for a hunter like him.After hugging the pup, Niu Hong sent the two of them out. At the end, he said that if anyone wanted a pup, let them tell that person that he had one here. Shen Xuanqing nodded and said yes, and left with Lu Gu.Returning along the way, Lu Gu held the pup in his arms. He originally wanted to put it in the bamboo basket, but once he put it in, the pup kept barking since it was away from the bitch, so he had to take it out again.The pup was very lively and not afraid of people at all. He barked a few times in his arms and arched his head in his palm. After he stopped barking, he bit his cuff and licked his fingers a few times, whimpering in his throat. Ugh, let Lu Gu stroke its fat and round body to soothe it for a while.The\u00a0pup was raised for Lu Gu, so he took it with him when he went to the mountain the next day.Dahui and the two small dogs were very curious about the arrival of the pup. They approached cautiously and sniffed the scent. The pup was not afraid of the big dogs and wanted to play with them. They whined and barked, more courageous, Dahui was bigger and more lively when he was young, and Shen Xuanqing thought that he would be a naughty in the future, so he had to be trained well so that he could be more stable when he grew up.After entering the mountain, the two of them cooked first, and Lu Gu took the pup out of the bamboo basket and played in the yard.The pup was two months old. He could run around and bite. He usually played and learnt from the bitch. Now that there was a big dog, he also wanted to play and bite. It was bigger than other puppies. But the mouth and teeth were not as good as those of a big dog, and soon because of it was too naughty, it was pushed down by the paw of the bigger dog, and it pressed against its neck with its teeth bared.The pup screamed in alarm, but didn\u2019t break free from the big dog's paws, twisting its fat body and barking, the sound really loud, so scared that Lu Gu hurried out of the kitchen to protect and drove the dog away. Finally, the puppy made a pitiful whining sound and moved towards his feet.\"It don't really bite, just scare it.\" Shen Xuanqing was chopping firewood in the yard and waiting for the meal to be ready. When he saw the pup was playing, he didn't care. The dogs would fight and play, but seeing Lu Gu was so anxious, he also came over to take a look. There was no injury at all, and besides, the pup was so fat, it looked tough enough to be beaten.It turned out to be like this, Lu Gu then put down the pup in his hand, in fact, with Shen Xuanqing in the yard, nothing would happen.The pup had learned a lesson and didn\u2019t dare to approach the big dog again, but it was not honest and went to catch Dahui after a while.Dahui was lying on the ground sleeping, and his big furry tail became the target of the pup. It seemed a little impatient to wag its tail. The pup got up and swept across the ground, then got up and found a place to lie down again.In the kitchen, Lu Gu uncovered the red cloth bag on the wine jar. The green snails were soaked in it. When he opened it, the red snail meat floated on top of the wine jar. He took the wooden basin used on the stove.Last time he found a lot of green snails, and fortunately he bought two jars of wine, otherwise one jar wouldn\u2019t be enough, Shen Xuanqing saved some wine before soaking the snails, this time he went to the mountain and bought another jar of five catties.After pouring, there was still powder slag of the green snail shell in the wine jar. Compared with other snails, this kind of thin-shelled green snail was very wonderful. After spit it out for a few days and wash it with sand, soak it in the wine directly, and the shell itself would be gone, the red snail meat was separated, and it could be eaten with just one stir-fry.Lu Gu only poured out one jar, and the remaining jar wouldn\u2019t spoil if soaked in wine, so he would bring\u00a0\u00a0it back home.\u00a0He scooped out the snail meat and there was still clear layer of wine on it. Wei Lanxiang had prepared autumn chili peppers and boiled soybeans for him yesterday, so he just fried them today.There were a few green ones in the pile of autumn chili peppers, and he cut them up. They looked good with the red hot peppers. Added soybeans, and put them into the pot one after another as soon as the oil became hot.They didn\u2019t grow many autumn chili peppers, so they asked the villagers to exchange some. This chili pepper was not very spicy. When it was out of the pot, sprinkled a handful of green autumn vegetables, red, yellow, and green. It looked pretty good and beautiful, the red snail meat tasted fresh and slightly spicy, and had the aroma of wine. It was really a good dish to accompany wine.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Now that the sun was out, it was time to let the chickens and ducks out to graze and swim. When he went to the backyard, he saw that the chickens and ducks all had come out of their grass nest and walked around while digging the ground.As soon as the fence gate was opened, the puppy followed Lu Gu in. When it saw the fluffy chickens, it ran over and wanted to bite, which caused the chickens to flee in a hurry, flapping its wings and screaming, and it became chaotic. Lu Gu quickly grabbed it, carried it away by the back of its neck so as not to bite the chickens or ducks.Because he wanted to drive the chickens and ducks out, Lu Gu could only lock the pup in the main room and closed the door of the main room, but the pup kept barking as soon as he was away from people. The more it barked, the more panicked it became, and the voice was not low. If he heard this voice at night, it would be quite scary in the silent mountain forest.Lu Gu couldn't lock it in the main room anymore, so he carried the small bamboo basket in front of him, and put the pup in it, the pup could see people when he looked up, and the barking immediately became quieter, Lu Gu touched it again, and there was nothing wrong with it. After a while, it stopped barking, tried to scratch a few times in the bamboo basket with its paws, and wanted to bite a few times.The chickens were the first to be driven outside the fence, and they were full after a day of eating. Lu Gu went back to the stone mortar and brought a basket of dried peppercorns and a long bamboo pole. The ducks followed him, lined up like he was a mother duck, and went out.He drove the ducks into the water, they swam a few times, and they were born with it, so there was no need for Lu Gu to drive them into the water. He put the stone mortar and the bamboo basket on the ground, and then unloaded the bamboo basket that carrying the puppies on his back.He moved two stones to sit on one and the other for the mortar, pounded peppercorns by the pond, looked up at the ducks in the pond from time to time, if they swam to the other side of the river, he would pick up the long bamboo pole on the ground and slapped the water surface, the water splashed, and the duck was scared back.The pup\u2019s fur was thin, but it was still pretty good. It played beside Lu Gu and didn\u2019t go far. At first, it wanted to go to the stone mortar to smell it, but Lu Gu pushed it away gently with his feet. He himself covered his mouth and nose with a cloth towel. It approached the basket full of peppercorns to smell it, and he probably didn't think it smelled good. Its wet little nose wrinkled, and it didn't come any closer.Later, the smell of pounding peppercorns dissipated, and it didn't go in front of Lu Gu, biting the hem of his clothes behind Lu Gu's back, imitating a big dog's threatening whine in its throat, but it was so small that it couldn't even make children afraid.Lu Gu was busy with work, as long as he could hear the movement behind him, he knew it hadn't run far, and besides, the numbing smell of peppercorn was on his hands, he couldn't play with the puppy, so he let it go first.When it was almost noon, he looked at the sky and felt hungry, so he went to the river to wash his hands. The pup followed him at his feet, step by step. The little head rubbed against his leg, which made Lu Gu smile a little.The life was busy and fulfilling, but seeing the accumulation of mountain goods and prey in the yard, no matter how tired he was, he was happy.The mountains and forests were far away, and the valleys were deep. A few dog barks echoed. Lu Gu bent down to search for purple bellies and green snails in the mountain stream. It rained yesterday, and the stream was bigger than before, and it was rushing.Today Shen Xuanqing came with him, followed by two small dogs, and locked the door to let Dahui watch the puppy in the yard.Both rolled up their trousers and walked barefoot in the stream. Lu Gu came out this time with an extra sack, caught a purple belly and threw it in, and the bamboo basket on his back was filled with green snails, so they could be separated easily.The mountain stream was colder than before, and when autumn came, the stream seeped deeper and deeper, but the green snails became fatter, and they would grow old and hide in the late autumn, and they would never be found again.\"If it's cold, go up and rest first.\" Shen Xuanqing grabbed a handful of purple bellies and waded over to the water, throwing the small purple bellies into the almost half-full sack.Now that he came over, Lu Gu also threw the green snails he found into the bamboo basket on his back, the two of them worked together as one.\"It\u2019s not cold just now.\" Lu Gu shook his head, he had just gone up to rest for a while, it was really not very cold right now.Hearing this, Shen Xuanqing said: \"That's fine if you pick it up again, it will be colder in the day after tomorrow, this much is enough to eat for a long time, and you don't need to look for it anymore.\"Lu Gu nodded and agreed.The two of them went into the water specially when the sun was bright, and it was past noon by now. This mountain stream was brought by Shen Xuanqing to Lu Gu. It was not the place last time, and it was far away, but there were a lot of green snails and purple belly crabs. .After the two of them landed on the shore, Lu Gu sat on the stone and stroked the water on his calf with his hands. His legs were a little blue from the cold. Even though the sun was shining, he subconsciously covered them with his palms and rubbed them lightly, trying to keep the calf and feet hot.Shen Xuanqing, who was sitting next to him drying his legs, saw it, hesitated, but stretched his arms and moved his legs over.Lu Gu was still dumbfounded, and his foot landed on Shen Xuanqing's thigh.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He rubbed his legs with both hands. he didn't know if it was caused by the heat because of rubbing or embarrassment, but the cold soon became less.Lu Gu didn't dare to refuse or speak, the young man who helped him to rub his legs bowed his head in silence.Rubbing and rubbing, Shen Xuanqing's adam's apple rolled, his lowered starry eyes gradually dimmed, Lu Gu's paleness, compared to the man's hard legs, Shuang'er's legs were completely soft and smooth, even the toes were round and cute.So the hands gradually slowed down, and the rubbing movements became lighter, with a certain impenetrable meaning.Even Lu Gu, who didn't understand any emotion, could feel the charm, but he didn't dare to let out his breath, his heart trembled slightly, he raised his eyes nervously and confused, and carefully looked at Shen Xuanqing's face.Shen Xuanqing, who was gradually getting lost, caressed such fair skin lightly, and slid his warm and rough palms like blasphemy, until he inadvertently raised his eyes, and the dark color in his eyes directly frightened Lu Gu.After seeing Lu Gu's terrified expression, Shen Xuanqing woke up. He froze, and it took him a long time to recover. He pretended to put down Lu Gu's legs naturally, and said, \"It's getting late, let's go back.\"Lu Gu hurriedly put on his shoes and socks, the trousers tightly covered his legs, the texture of the fabric made him felt at ease like never before, he didn't quite understand what was going on, but he also knew that he was embarrassed, so he didn't dare to look at Shen Xuanqing again .It happened that there were a lot of watercress here, so Lu Gu squatted by the stream and picked half a basket of the tender ones.After he finished his work, Shen Xuanqing came out today carrying his big bamboo basket as usual, with half a basket of green snails in it. It could be seen how many he found today, which was definitely enough to eat for a long time. He tied the sack containing the small crabs, to avoid them climbing out, he put it in a bamboo basket and carried it together.Lu Gu followed him back with a smaller bamboo basket on his back, and the two small dogs followed him unhurriedly.Compared with the previous journey, both of them were a little silent and uncomfortable.\u00a0On weekdays, even after having intercourse, Shen Xuanqing wouldn\u2019t feel anything, this was his own fulang, intercourse was a matter of course, but now he couldn't figure it out, he didn't understand why he would like that.Even if a countryman had studied, what he usually worried about was earning money and rations. He didn't have the time to think about other things. He only knew how to have sex.As he was walking, Lu Gu stopped to pick wild tea. He saw them when he came, and told Shen Xuanqing to pick some when he came back. The wild tea he picked last time had already dried in half a basket. He picked it often, but he could take it down the mountain for Wei Lanxiang and the others. Sometimes if he wanted to exchange things with the villagers, he could take this tea.Shen Xuanqing came back to his senses and picked tea leaves with him. It was not as embarrassing as it was just now. While picking tea leaves, he said: \"I saw a lot of them on the other side before, and I picked them some other day. When Master was here I would pick them for him, he likes to drink wild tea from the mountains.\"\"Yeah.\" Lu Gu nodded and agreed in a low voice, and when the bamboo basket on his back was full, the two set foot on the road again.In the yard, three bamboo plaques were placed on the horizontal wooden frame to dry goji berries, and two large bamboo plaques were placed on the pile of firewood to dry wild tea.\u00a0Chestnuts and hazelnuts were air-dried in a cool and ventilated main room, otherwise the sun would dry out the meat inside and it wouldn\u2019t taste sweet.There was also a lot of slender grass in the front yard. After drying, it could be used for fire or as a nest for chickens and ducks. In late autumn, when there was a lot of rain, the grass in the nest could be replaced frequently. There was straw in the house at the foot of the mountain, but not much was brought up. The mountain road was far away, and it took effort to carry everything, so it was better to dry your own hay here.The mushrooms he picked were also sliced and shredded to dry, and he put half of them in a clean cloth bag. It rained yesterday, and he would go out in the next two days. There must be a lot in the forest and the road in the mountains.Autumn colors were getting thicker and the weather was colder than before. In previous years, he was very worried at this time. Once winter came and he couldn\u2019t find food outside, he would be cold and hungry. This year was different. He had food and clothing but he still cared about winter, so he wanted to save all the winter rations he could save. He even dried some wild vegetables, put them in sacks and put the mushrooms in a cool and dry low room, and put two baskets of dried goji berries in it.Lu Gu moved the goji berries on the bamboo plaque with his hands, and turned them evenly for better drying. He was still thinking that when he went out, he saw a lot of horse-tooth vegetables (\u9a6c\u9f7f\u83dc) on the road, and they were edible. The tender ones could be fried or steamed, after being dried in the sun, it could still be eaten in winter.As long as there was enough water, horse tooth vegetables would grow very vigorously, and there were few other wild vegetables, and it should be possible to add this to dry, and there were also ground vegetables. When he went uphill with Shen Xuanqing, he saw them not far away, you could pick them up for eating, and you could dry them and eat them in winter when you carried them back.Compared to mushrooms, wild vegetables were worthless, so Lu Gu always put them in sacks. He also prepared a sack for dried mushrooms.After two days, the sweet nest roots (\u751c\u7a9d\u6839) could be dug up. They were also wild vegetables, but they were eaten in pieces, and the big ones could be bigger than his fist. When they were dug up, they were piled in the corner of the wall, covered with soil, and could be eaten until the next spring.There was quite a lot of work to be done, Lu Gu hurried into the kitchen to cook while thinkingPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Shen Xuanqing was with him, and this time he came out without locking the courtyard door, but the puppy and the big dogs, they all stayed in the yard and were not allowed to follow, otherwise they would trample on the ground vegetables (\u5730\u76ae\u83dc) and sniffed them.The green and black ground vegetables were soft, a bit like black mushrooms soaked in hair. After it rained, a lot of them grew on the ground. Lu Gu and Shen Xuanqing picked them up, and turned a large area on the hillside, and picked them up. I went back with a full basket.After they came back, neither of them was idle. The ground vegetables grew on the ground, and the grass leaves and broken branches were caught in them when they were picked up. Lu Gu washed them three times before spreading them on the bamboo plaques.Shen Xuanqing stepped on the wood and sawed the wood. This tree was cut by him two days ago, and he sawed it into sections so that it could be chopped into firewood.Lu Gu got up and wanted to pour water, but the dog's thick paws stepped on his shoe and bit his trousers. His fat and round body was quite heavy, so he had to pull the dog away first.Busy, it was getting late, Lu Gu boiled a pot of hot water to wash his hands, he was used to clean his teeth with green salt and wash his face at night, he still felt uncomfortable without washing for a day, after washing, he poured hot water to soak their feet and sat on the bed. Their feet were hot, and the mountain stream was icy cold. The two of them soaked in the stream for a long time, and it was good to drive away the cold.Lu Gu originally wanted to wait for Shen Xuanqing to finish washing before soaked his feet. There was still water in the pot. If the water was not dirty, added some hot water to the basin, but Shen Xuanqing glanced at him and said: \"The wooden basin is big, why don\u2019t you and I wash together, and take a rest early after washing.\u201dHearing this, Lu Gu felt that it was inappropriate, but when he thought that Shen Xuanqing was not someone else, and he never dared to refuse Shen Xuanqing\u2019s words, he hesitated, and finally under Shen Xuanqing's gaze, he lowered his head, moved a chair opposite, took off his shoes and socks and carefully put his feet in.The room was silent for a while, neither of them spoke, only the canddlestick was burning.Speaking of it, Shen Xuanqing was actually impulsive, and didn\u2019t move after Lu Gu put his feet in, for fear that his rough big feet would hurt his white and soft feet.Lu Gu was more cautious than him, he lowered his head and didn't dare to look at anyone, but what he saw was the soaked feet of the two.The wooden basin was indeed quite big, Shen Xuanqing put his feet on both sides, he had to be careful not to move in the middle of the wooden basin, otherwise he would bump into Shen Xuanqing.If it wasn't for him being confused, he would soak his feet together with Shen Xuanqing, the hot water would actually be quite comfortable to scald his feet.After a while, Shen Xuanqing, who had slowed down first, made a movement. He moved his foot slightly to make the water sway slightly. He raised his foot and gently pressed it on Lu Gu's foot, rolled his Adam's apple, pretended to be natural with a slightly hoarse voice, and said : \"It's good to rub your feet.\"Most people would rub their feet subconsciously when they were scalding their feet. Even if they didn't use their hands, they would rub their feet overlapping.However, it was not normal for Lu Gu right now, he sat stiffly and didn\u2019t dare to move, the sound of water was soft, and the touch on his feet was very obvious, this was a strange but not unfamiliar emotion, sometimes at night when Shen Xuanqing pressed him, he could touch his waist or other places, so he was not very unfamiliar with touching.It was the first time for Shen Xuanqing to wash his fulang\u2019s feet, his throat was tight, and his eyes were darkened. He had never done this kind of thing before, and after rubbing it for a while, he felt that it was too abrupt and offensive, and he didn't dare to use any strength, for fear of stepping on Lu Gu, he gave a fake cough and took a cloth towel and handed it to Lu Gu to wipe his feet first.After wiping his feet, Lu Gu went to bed first, and Shen Xuanqing took out the basin to pour the water. He turned over on the bed and couldn't help but wanted to curl up. Even if he didn't understand love, he was ashamed and couldn't just wash with a man.It was cold at night, Shen Xuanqing closed the main room door and the bedroom door, turned off the light and went to bed in the dark, he couldn't sleep, Lu Gu\u2019s raw feet were dangling in front of his eyes, his feet were hot after scalding, it seemed that even the little uneasiness in his heart became hot, and when he couldn't bear it anymore, it became very urgent.When the man next to him stretched out his arms, Lu Gu thought he was going to let him sleep in his arms, but he pressed him directly, as anxious as the first few times, and rushed straight in as soon as he was ready.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The autumn rice was ripe, so they had to cut it back as soon as the weather was good, otherwise the rice would be too ripe and fall into the field, and it would be difficult to pick it up .The sun was shining at noon, and almost no one in the village with paddy fields went back to eat. It was enough for the whole family to go back to cook, and the rest continued to cut rice, and sat on the ridge of the field to rest, ate and drank when the food and water were delivered.Shen Xuanqing's family originally had five acres of paddy fields and five acres of dry fields, which were earned by Shen Shunfu's hard work when he was young. In the village, it could be said that there were many fields, and there was no barren land. Sold two acres of paddy fields and three acres of dry fields.After paying off the debt this summer, Shen Yaoqing thought about buying a few more acres, but if Wei Lanxiang wanted to marry off Shen Xuanqing, she didn't have too much money in her hand, so she put it aside and saved it later.The three acres of paddy fields had a bumper harvest, and the two acres of dry land have already harvested autumn beans and then planted winter wheat. Recently, there was no need to worry too much. Harvesting autumn rice was a big deal.Lu Gu stepped into the mud and bent over to cut the rice. His body was covered with a lot of muddy water. The sun was very hot. After cutting for a while, he straightened up slowly, wiped the sweat on his forehead with his sleeve, and looked forward. The images of people coming out of the village were Shen Yan and Ji Qiuyue.\"Mother, take a break.\" From a distance, Ji Qiuyue yelled, she and Shen Yan both carried baskets filled with water and food.Wei Lanxiang straightened up when she heard the voice, she said, \"Breakfast is here, take a rest.\"Shen Xuanqing and Shen Yaoqing cut quickly, and they were already ahead. Lu Gu wanted to catch up with them, but Wei Lanxiang told him to stop, and to work again when he was full and strong. It was early in the morning, so he had to take a break.Ji Qiuyue warmed up a lot of steamed buns, fried loach and eel with oil, brought pickled vegetables, and fried a dish. During the busy farming season, people must be full and had enough oil and water, otherwise they would be hungry quickly after work.The loach and eel were caught by Shen Yaoqing before the water in the paddy field was cut off, and some autumn rice fish were kept in the pots at home, and they were eaten immediately after catching them, without having to buy meat.She and Shen Yan also sat on the ground to eat together, filled a bamboo tube with a lot of water, and made a bowl of brown sugar water for the whole family to share.\"This year's harvest is good. After the harvest is over, let's go to the town to eat.\" Wei Lanxiang looked at the golden rice with joy in her eyes. After so long in the sun, her face was red and there were some wrinkles on her face. But the face was kind, and the smile on the slightly weathered face revealed a bit of kindness.\"That's for sure.\" Ji Qiuyue swallowed the steamed buns in her mouth and said: \"I don't want to talk about the back, I just washed the rice, I will steam it and eat dry rice at night, and we will have more strength tomorrow.\"Dry rice naturally was better than rice porridge with added water, and it filled the stomach. Their family was not bad, and many families in the countryside could only eat a dry rice during the busy farming season.\"Hey.\" Wei Lanxiang nodded her head in agreement, she must eat better after work.In the joy of the rice harvest in the past few days, the three-acre paddy field was cut, and it was pulled to the grain field by a cart to dry.Since it was early, Wei Lanxiang made up his mind, went back to wash and rest his feet, and went to the town for lunch in the afternoon, they would come back in the evening after eating.Meat could be eaten even at home, but restaurants were different. Everyone in the Shen family had smiles on their faces, even Lu Gu looked forward to it, he had never eaten anything in the restaurants and taverns.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There were many carts carrying loads along the way. It was very busy. It was all about the harvest, and the red and tanned faces were full of joy.In the previous years, Lu Gu was brought by the Lu family to harvest the autumn rice, he was tired of working hard, but now, seeing other people's family harvesting so much rice with a smile on his face, he also felt the joy of a good harvest.When they arrived at Fenggu Town, there were quite a lot of people on the street, and they could still see people pushing rice carts. Not all of the towns people were craftsmen, ordinary people were also farmers, and they had land outside the town. In fact, it was no different from country people.Wei Lanxiang looked at the restaurants and taverns on the street, and asked Shen Yaoqing: \"I said Daqing, where do you think we can eat?\"Shen Yaoqing thought about it and said: \"We had eaten at Chen Ji Restaurant, why don't we go there?\u00a0It\u2019s also an old shop for many years.\u201d\u201cokay, let\u2019s go there.\u201d Wei Lanxiang hadn\u2019t eaten in a restaurant in the town in the past few years, so she was a little hesitant just now, not knowing where to go, and now she also thought of Chen Ji\u2019s sauced beef, Shen Shunfu took her to eat several times when she was young.People in the country often ate chicken, duck and pork. Beef and mutton were expensive, and they were rarely bought. Moreover, the stewed meat in sauce made by the cooks in the restaurants was really different from the taste at home.Chen Ji's restaurant was on the East Street, since it was decided to go there, there was no need to look around the street, a group of six turned into the East Street and went straight to Chen Ji.Xiaoer greeted them at the door, and when he saw them coming in, he quickly said courteously: \"Guests, please.\"After sitting down, Shen Yaoqing and Shen Xuanqing asked Wei Lanxiang to pick up her favorite food. There were so many of them, and there were two tall men, even if they were all dressed as countrymen, they were rich if they could come in to eat. Xiaoer poured water for them, and reported the name of the dishes while pouring water, speaking quickly and smoothly.Lu Gu had never been in a restaurant before, and knew nothing about ordering food. He looked at the layout of the restaurant nervously and curiously. When he heard Xiaoer's words sound like singing, he couldn't help but listened a little longer, feeling novel.After Wei Lanxiang listened, she pondered for a while and said, \"Let\u2019s have duck feet, big elbows, and sauced beef, and two pots of good wine.\"Everything was expensive, and it was not worth it to eat vegetarian dishes. Only these few big meats were enough. When people in the village asked about it after returning home, it was decent to say it.\"Okay, sir, wait a moment, let's have a cup of tea first.\" Xiaoer threw the towel over his shoulder, and then said the name of the dishes to the back kitchen. A few more people came in at the door, and he stepped forward to welcome them in again.When Wei Lanxiang lived a good life with Shen Shunfu when she was young, she had seen the world, and she was not afraid of ordering food, and she was not stingy. Most of the meat and drink must had entered Shen Xuanqing and Shen Yaoqing's stomach. If you couldn't eat too much, you wouldn\u2019t \u00a0be full.Even if she was partial to her two sons, they were the main earners of the family, and she got all the money for going out to restaurants today from her two sons, so it was understandable to reward her son and eat some big meat.\"Is there any green plum wine?\" Shen Xuanqing asked when Xiaoer came over with two jars of wine.\"Yes, sir, would you like a jar?\" Xiaoer asked with a smile.Asked the price of green plum wine, it was three copper coins more expensive than outside, Shen Xuanqing asked him to bring a jar, seeing this, Wei Lanxiang didn't say anything, since Shen Xuanqing wanted it, she couldn't stop it for her son\u2019s face.The big elbows, sauced beef and the duck feet came up. It took a while to burn the elbow, and it was delicious when it was hot and soft.Meat and wine was here, today was happy, even Lu Gu and Shen Yan had a small glass of wine, they hold like Shen Yaoqing and Shen Xuanqing, and toasted Wei Lanxiang a glass.Wei Lanxiang laughed so hard that she couldn't close her mouth. After drinking the wine, she hissed softly, and said quickly, \"Eat meat, eat meat, today, let's go back after eating to our heart's content.\"The food at Chen Ji Restaurant was more expensive, but the meat dishes they served were all in large plates. The sauced beef had a strong fresh flavor, neither hard nor firewood. It tasted meaty and refreshing.Lu Gu had never eaten beef before. He took a piece of beef and tasted it. He felt that there was no more delicious meat anymore. He stuffed the remaining half of the meat into his mouth and chewed the meat. His eyes widened a little, as if surprised. Shen Xuanqing, who looked sideways at him, couldn't help but chuckled, and took another piece of beef for him and handed it with the chopsticks.Lu Gu hadn't finished chewing, his cheeks bulged slightly and he couldn't speak. He glanced at Shen Xuanqing and found a smile on Shen Xuanqing's face, so he carefully clamped the piece of beef.Shen Yaoqing ate and drank, and when he was happy, he said to them: \"I heard people say that eating beef in winter warms the stomach. I will buy a big piece of beef and take it home. Let's eat it.\"\" Look at you, you are so beautiful, you can eat a big piece and don't cut it up.\" Ji Qiuyue gave him a sideways glance, even though she said so, the smile on her face didn\u2019t diminish.People lived for the sake of getting better and better, so even just talking about it was enough to make people happy.The smell of the good wine was clear, and it smelled different. The duck feet was a little bit salty with the aroma of wine, which was salty and fragrant.The hot big elbow was also brought, and a large plate was placed in the middle of the table.\"Bring a bowl or a plate.\" Shen Xuanqing said to Xiaoer, the meat of the elbow was soft and rotten, not to mention the lean meat, the fat one was not easy to pick up, it would be a pity if it fell off, and the meat was hot while holding it with his hand, took the bowl and no need to worry it would fall when you ate it.The Xiaoer was quick with his hands and feet, and quickly brought them bowls, one for each of them.Everyone's chopsticks went towards the elbows. Lu Gu was a step slower than others, and he didn't dare to be the first. Besides, with five pairs of chopsticks, he was also afraid that he would stretch it out and blocked the others. Before the big elbows reached his mouth, he could smell it. Such a strong meat aroma, even after eating beef and duck feet, could still make people greedy.After everyone else had pinched it, Lu Gu was about to stretch out his chopsticks, but Shen Xuanqing, whose arms were much longer than his, put a piece of fat and big elbow meat into his bowl.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She smiled and looked at her second child. At first, she thought thi kid and Lu Gu couldn't get along, but now he had learned to love others.Knowing that Lu Gu was reserved, Shen Xuanqing had to let his fulang ate well for the first time when he went out to eat at a restaurant, otherwise he wouldn\u2019t be capable as a husband.The big red elbow was warm and soft, the fat meat was soft and not greasy, the meat was fragrant and mellow, and the lean meat was also tender and soft, which was very satisfying and palatable.Country people always liked meat with fat, and it tasted good to satisfy their cravings, and Lu Gu was no exception, he was not picky about fat meat, not to mention that this elbow was very tasty, and the fat meat was full of fragrance.After eating the meat, drank the sweet and sour green plum wine. These days, even Shen Yan sighed in satisfaction. She was young and greedy, and said to Wei Lanxiang, \"Mom, let's come next time.\"\"Okay , come next time too.\" Wei Lanxiang nodded and promised her.Seeing her daughter so happy eating a meal, the corners of her eyes gradually became moist. The two brothers Shen Yaoqing and Shen Xuanqing were fine. A few years ago, one was fifteen and one was twenty, but her little daughter had no father when she was only a little over eight years old. Well, even if she ate some good ones when she was young, she was too young to remember things, and she had long forgotten the taste. she had suffered from eating bran and vegetables with them these few years.She was happy today, and tears came out for no reason. Since Wei Lanxiang lost her man, she cheered up and figured it out how to be better than in the previous years. She turned her head and pretended to wipe her mouth with a handkerchief. Ate and drank happily.The other people at the table actually saw it, but when they saw that she had recovered, they kept silent, eating meat and drinking happily, chatting and joking from time to time, in a lively and amicable way.Lu Gu was more cautious in picking up vegetables. Wei Lanxiang picked up a chopstick and elbow meat for Shen Yan. When she turned her head and saw him, the mother was soft-hearted. Wasn't Lu Gu just like Shen Yan, who was even more miserable under the hands of\u00a0\u00a0Du Hehua, she picked up another meat for Lu Gu, she said: \"Eat quickly Guzi.\"\"Mother.\" Lu Gu's eyes were full of gratitude, and he called mother in a low voice without knowing what to say, which made people felt softer.Shen Xuanqing sat beside him, watched and listened, harmony at home was the best thing in the world.Satisfied with wine and meat, Wei Lanxiang was a little bit pained when the bill was settled, it was good meat and good wine, which was completely different from the wine they usually bought in the village, and they ate 650 copper coins for this meal alone , more than six hundreds.\u00a0Fortunately, she brought enough money when she went out, so she wouldn't be embarrassed.Xiaoer sent them out, accompanied by the voice of \"Guests, please come again\", the whole family went home satisfied.The sun was in the west, the sky was full of clouds, and the faces of pedestrians were glowing red. Wei Lanxiang and Ji Qiuyue walked in the front, Lu Gu and Shen Yan were one step behind, and Shen Xuanqing and Shen Yaoqing were at the end.Turned out from the East Street, and went out of the town, who knew that before going out, Ji Qiuyue had sharp eyes, and saw a fairly familiar figure walking on the street, and it was Lu Wen, and Lu Wen was followed behind a servant girl and a boy, this behavior really looked like the young master Shuang'er in the town.\"Who is it? It turned out to be the young master of the Lu family.\" Thinking of those bad things, Ji Qiuyue became furious. She was young and couldn't hide her words. \u201cIf you look at another taller branch, I'm afraid you regret your marriage and hid in the town, don't blame others for poking your back.\"When Lu Wen saw them, he felt bad, hearing this his face became ugly, and he tightly held the handkerchief in his hand. Although the servants behind him didn't know the Shen family, they could tell that she was scolding Lu Wen, and immediately shouted: \"You don't had long eyes, who are you scolding?\"Shen Yaoqing and Shen Xuanqing both came forward, the two brothers were taller than the other, no boy could compare to him, Ji Qiuyue was of course not afraid when she was with her man, she sneered and said, \"Who am I scolding? I didn't scold him for\u00a0such a snobbish person, scold him for disliking the poor and loving the rich, scold him for regretting his marriage and hooking up with wild man!\"\"Well, you bastard...\" Before the boy could swear, Shen Yaoqing stood in front of Ji Qiuyue, his eyebrows furrowed. He couldn't hide his anger, and said: \"Shouting and scolding woman, are you still a man? Today we are talking about those people who have no conscience and will\u00a0\u00a0be punished by God. If you are not convinced, come and tell me, let's compete. \"Although he was not as tall as Shen Xuanqing, he was also taller than ordinary men. Naturally, his physique was not weak after working all year round. The bullying boy would\u00a0\u00a0be cowed at once, but with so many people on the street watching, he could only stand in the front.Lu Wen wanted to save face the most. Seeing that there were more and more onlookers, and Ji Qiuyue's shrew was so talkative, he couldn't afford to lose this person, so he had to whisper to the boy: \"Okay, it's just some vulgar and slanderous words. Why bother with them, if there is a big trouble and the officials come to ask, won\u2019t it be harming them.\"\"I\u2019m born in poverty, and I know that it\u2019s not easy to be a countryman. How can a family like this\u00a0\u00a0survive, forget it, go back, just pretend you don\u2019t hear it.\" Lu Wen backed down again and again, speaking with forbearance and a merciful look.Ji Qiuyue laughed angrily with his words, and said loudly: \"Just go, when I get to the yamen, I will\u00a0\u00a0show the original marriage certificate to the big guys to see who was engaged and regretted the marriage and hooked up with other man.\"Hearing this, Lu Wen's face turned pale, and he almost tore the handkerchief in his hand. He was so annoyed, but there were more and more people, so he had to leave bitterly.Ji Qiuyue got a little angry, and even Wei Lanxiang patted her on the arm, but what Lu Wen said just now let them know that this restless shuang\u2019er must had hooked up with powerful people in the town, but so what, scolding and cursing, facing this hated person, there was nothing else to think about except anger and resentment.Lu Gu hid behind and didn't dare to speak, he was married because of Lu Wen, and it was his blessing that the Shen family didn't beat him up, so how dare he spoke at this time.Shen Xuanqing didn't say anything, but after hearing what Lu Wen said, he thought of\u00a0\u00a0Li Mingshan, whose surname was Li. He had asked someone to inquire about it before. Knowing a thug in a brothel, it was not difficult to deal with.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It\u2019s the best if this kind of person is not married.\"Upon hearing this, Wei Lanxiang began to chant Buddha: \"Amitabha, isn't it? Thanks God we didn't marry him back.\"Lu Gu walked behind and didn't dare to speak, Shen Yan was next to him, and she stopped smiling when she saw Lu Wen just now, and she still glared at Lu Wen like that, this man was good-looking , but the heart was really bad.Just now Ji Qiuyue was so angry that she didn't care about her superiors. Now that she found Lu Wen's words, she was a country woman after all, so she asked worriedly: \"Mother, is there anything wrong?\"Wei Lanxiang was still thinking, and Shen Xuanqing spoke first, he said: \"It's okay, leave it to me, you don't care, just live as usual, these few days I'm in the town to manage things.\"He spoke quite reliably, without the slightest worry, which made Ji Qiuyue's heart dropped back all of a sudden to her stomach, nodded in response.Walking back out of the town, under Shen Yaoqing's jokes, the whole family smiled again, Wei Lanxiang also talked with a smile, if there was a real trouble, they who were bare feet were not afraid of people who wearing shoes, at worst they would fight for old bones.[the\u00a0barefooted\u00a0people are\u00a0not afraid\u00a0of those who\u00a0wear shoes\u00a0(idiom); fig. the poor, who have nothing to lose, don\u2019t fear\u00a0those\u00a0in\u00a0power]Shen Yaoqing agreed with her to show his determination, which made his mother happy anyway.Speaking of which, the Shen family really had a marriage contract in their hands. It was a private contract, not an official. This was done according to Qingxi Village's customary rules. The private contract only needed to invite a matchmaker and a prestigious elder who could read and write. It was not easy for rural people to get married. Once the marriage contract was written and married, they would live together.When Wei Lanxiang got married, it was a private marriage contract, and Ji Qiuyue too. It could be said that every family in Qingxi Village was like this, and other villages were also like this. Besides, before the Lu family showed their fox tails, how could they had thought that they wouldn\u2019t marry, so Even if Shen Xuanqing had studied, because of this vulgar agreement, he never thought about the government at all when he got engaged.At the beginning, Shen Xuanqing didn't make a fuss with the government, but then Shen Xuanqing knew that the members of the Li family had a good relationship with the county magistrate. The people in the village were not very familiar with the law. It would be fine if the county magistrate reasonable and lawabiding, but if he did something to help the Li family, he wouldn\u2019t be able to fight with his mud legs, and he would also implicate the family. After seeing the face of the Lu family, he was unwilling to get involved with them again.As for Lu Gu, Shen Xuanqing said that when he bought him, he had no time to speak plain words, and asked Bao Zhiru and several people in Anjia Village to testify. He pressed his finger without knowing it, in order to prevent the Lu family members from making troubles one day, so they could have a slave contract to talk about.The deed of sale was clearly written with the money and was pressed with the finger. Someone witnessed that the buyer and the seller were voluntary, not forced to buy and sell. Lu Gu had a father who didn't love and no mother only his stepmother, so no one would take the trouble to run around for him.After bringing back Lu Gu, Shen Xuanqing only asked someone to inquire about Li Mingshan, and didn\u2019t take any other actions. He was unable to deal with people in the town by himself. He had to spend money to invite people to drink and eat. Because he had to pay off his debt so this matter was on hold.After being with Lu Gu for a long time, he felt better. He closed the door to earn money to live. What was Lu Wen? .But since Lu Wen threatened them first, he wouldn\u2019t be polite.The rice had to dry for two days before threshing. Before getting busy, Shen Xuanqing went to town again the day after eating at the restaurant.The brothel was located on the West Street, and at night this was a place where the lights were always bright. People came and went during the day, but it was not as lively at night.Shen Xuanqing didn't enter the brothel, and turned into the alley behind the brothel. This alley was narrower, and the door looked a little more messy and dilapidated than other places. He stopped in front of a black lacquered door, diagonally opposite to the backyard of the brothel.After knocking on the door a few times, he heard a man's rough voice from inside, asking who was outside the door.Shen Xuanqing talked to him, and soon the door opened, and a slovenly man came out, he just got up from the bed, his clothes were not well dressed, and his hair was messed up.\"I said who is it, it's you, come in quickly.\" Luo Biao greeted him, caught the wine jar Shen Xuanqing threw towards him with both hands, opened and smelled it, then smiled, he said: \"This is good wine.\"Shen Xuanqing also carried an oil paper bag in his hand, opened it turned out to be a roast chicken, Luo Biao rolled up the bedding, moved the table in the middleof the kang, and the two sat on the kang to eat and drink.[\u7095\u00a0kang: a heatable brick bed]The strong wine was spicy, Luo Biao took a sip, put down the wine cup, shook his head and sighed, \"Good wine!\"He asked Shen Xuanqing how his family was and how his business was, and while drinking, he said a few gossip, After four or five cups wine and meat he was full of joy, Luo\u00a0Biao\u00a0said: \"Second Brother Shen, if you had anything to say, just ask, brother will never refuse.\"\u00a0He couldn't even eat, his mother was dying of illness, his father died and he couldn't even buy a coffin, and he dug a hole with the broken mat and buried him. He took his old mother and knelt on the street to sell himself to save his mother, but the treatment would cost a lot of money, except for the rich and benevolent people, who wanted to buy a long-term handyman and brought back a sick burden.Shen Xuanqing passed by when he came to the town to work as a coolie. Seeing that his old mother was dying and screaming hungry, he stopped and hesitated, he gave Luo Biao two cold steamed buns in his arms. This was the ration that Wei Lanxiang brought for him for a day.He gave it and was about to leave. Luo Biao stopped him and asked his name. He shook his head and didn't say much. Luo Biao turned around and broke a piece of cold steamed buns to feed his old mother. Shen Xuanqing didn't see why he carried his old mother on his back to bury her. He had to catch up with the merchants when he went to work to carry the big bags.Hearing this, Shen Xuanqing was not polite to him, and said: \"Do you still remember Li Mingshan I asked you to inquire about?\"Luo Biao thought about it for a while before saying: \"It's that grandson, I saw him in the building a few days ago, Don't look at him like a man on the outside, his eyes when he is staring at the girl in the building are straight, but his old lady was so strict that he can only sneak around if he is greedy, and dare not come here often, you haven\u2019t seen his dirty face, as soon as he enters the room, he take off his pants and arch to them, and his legs tremble when he is in a hurry, and sister Yao laughed behind his back.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He didn't know how to hide his words, and Shen Xuanqing didn't feel anything when he heard it. He looked as usual and just said: \"I came here today to entrust you with this matter. Since he likes to visit brothels, ask someone to take him go\u00a0often, if you can make him rest in the building, it\u2019s best not to go home for ten days and a half months.\"He said, Shen Xuanqing pushed the money wrapped in red cloth over the table, which contained ten taels of silver, which was quite a lot.\"Second Brother Shen, you are...\" Luo Biao wanted to say no, but was interrupted.\"Don\u2019t you need to drink when you are looking for someone to do business? The girls in the building also buy rouge and gouache.\" Shen Xuanqing raised his eyes slightly, and then said quietly: \"I beg you to do something, and I will naturally spend the money. There is no need to shirk, just deal with the matter, later, I have to find you again.\"\"Since that's the case, don't worry, Second Brother Shen, I will definitely do it.\" Luo Biao put the money aside and poured the wine for both of them.After getting drunk, he asked one more question why he had to deal with Li Mingshan at this moment. He knew about Lu Wen. He went when Shen Xuanqing got married before. When he heard that Lu Wen threatened the Shen family with the government, he patted the table and cursed a few foul words, and then patted his chest to guarantee that Li Mingshan, this grandson would be too hungry (for sex) to walk around.Shen Xuanqing didn't underestimate his words, and explained a few more words to him, asking to find out about how Lu Wen was with in the town, and then drank again.Speaking of which, there were quite a few wealthy merchants in Fenggu Town, and there were two surnamed Li. Li Mingshan's family opened a silk and satin shop in the town, and they had money, the power was also there.It was impossible for a countryman to go head-to-head with a rich man, so he could only find another way. Li Mingshan was worthless, and he could only deal with lust. If he lingerred in the flower house and didn't come home, who could blame others .After Shen Xuanqing left, Luo Biao was considered reliable, after sleeping in the afternoon, he went to drink with the regular customers who often came to the building to had fun and knew Li Mingshan. A man who ate, drank, prostituted and gambled was not a good thing. Luo Biao still intentionally or unintentionally talked about Lu Wen who had hooked up with Li Mingshan, thinking of that handsome appearance, the man surnamed Bu licked his lips and an evil light appeared in his eyes.The sun was setting, and just as it was getting dark, the lanterns in front of the brothel were lit up, and the inside was even brighter and more lively.Luo Biao came in from the backyard, turned his eyes around the downstairs lobby, and saw that Bu Zicheng brought Li Mingshan, and the food was not in vain. He winked at Hong Yao, a familiar sister, Hong Yao understood, and went to pull Li Mingshan with a smile. Pressed him to sit down and drink a glass of wine.Li Mingshan's appearance was not bad, the silk clothes were noble and decent, and he looked like a gentleman who was studying when he shook his fan, but it was a pity that he just drank a glass of wine at this moment, smelling the fragrance of the powder on Hong Yao, he was intoxicated, and immediately embodying the prototype of lewdness, he caressed her waist lightly, and even pinched her buttocks when others were not paying attention, making Hong Yao laughed at him in her heart.The girl in the brothel just resorted some tricks to make Li Mingshan stayed for two nights. He usually only came for an hour or two before leaving to enjoy himself secretly.After returning home, his mother Zhang Shi blocked him at the door. Li Mingshan lied, saying that he was sleeping at a classmate's house. If you were superior, you would never go astray, so that's all.Speaking of which, most of Li Mingshan's cronies and friends who came and went in the daytime were the same as him, with a shell of a scholar, only they knew the dirty inside, and they would help each other to make excuses to cover up, thinking that visiting brothels and drinking flowers wine were nothing, what was wrong with men having fun, if the family didn't allow it, just didn't let the family know.How could Lu Wen, a Shuang'er from the countryside knew about it even Zhang Shi didn\u2019t know? The Shuang'ers and girls of good people in the town, just like him, who hadn\u2019t left the burdoir couldn\u2019t easily know the dirty things of those men.Two days later, before evening, Li Mingshan was thinking about the feeling in the middle of the afternoon, and found a pretense of looking for a classmate friend to leave the house. Even Lu Wen, he didn't bother to look at him, and went straight to the brothel.It was a coincidence that he met Bu Zicheng again, and the two sat at a table in the lobby to drink.While drinking, Bu Zicheng saw that Li Mingshan was holding the sister in his arms and was about to float away, so he couldn't suppress the evil thoughts in his heart, and said with a light smile: \"Brother Li, if Brother Li doesn't dislike it, this shuang\u2019er beside me will be happy with you for tonight. Treat you as a brother.\"As soon as he opened his mouth, Shuang'er beside him sat down beside Li Mingshan, which made Li Mingshan's eyes widened in surprise, there was such a good thing.Bu Zicheng didn't invite him for nothing, and when he saw him taking the bait, he lowered his voice and said, \"I heard that Lu Wen live in the town recently, if Brother Li doesn't mind, how about we play for a while?\"Hearing this, Li Mingshan's expression changed after a while, and he sneered and said angrily, \"What are they, they are going to be replaced? Brother Bu dares to speak.\"Li Mingshan also had a temper, not a little temper, immediately turned down his face and pushed sister HongYao away, but Bu Zicheng hit the wall, his sensuality failed, and he sat there holding his wine glass tightly with an ugly expression on his face.Besides, Li Mingshan and Lu Wen had been in love since they met, but because of the upright and noble person on the surface, they only held hands and never slept.Speaking of which, Lu Wen was really good-looking, otherwise, Li Mingshan, who was used to see beauties in the town, wouldn\u2019t fall in love with him. He was handsome and beautiful, bright and charming when he smiled and frowning he was sad could make people's hearts soften. Sighed, with his pitiful and charming appearance, he gave everything he wanted.After leaving the brothel, he remembered that he hadn't visited Lu Wen in the past few days, so Li Mingshan passed by. He didn't notice that Luo Biao glanced at him from behind, and soon an inconspicuous short and thin boy followed.Lu Wen pretended to be studying, on the surface, it seemed that he was staying at the house of his classmate Shuang'er, but in fact, he entered a courtyard in the back street through the secret door in the backyard of that family. It was bought by Li Mingshan. Usually Lu Wen and the servant girl lived in the back street, and came through the secret door when he went out. His classmate's family took the money and favored him, and they naturally supported him and they didn't dare to reveal any words, so anyone couldn't find any fault on the surface.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The Shen family made him lost face in the street. He was very annoyed and wanted to find a way to suppress them. At worst, he would make Shen Xuanqing unable to sell his prey in the town, even if he couldn\u2019t interfere for a long time.But Li Mingshan hadn't been here for the past few days, and the servant girl said that she didn't see the young master when she went back to Li's house, and the maid said that he went to find his classmates to write poems and compete.Lu Wen was not suspicious of this, after all, he didn't know anything.Just as he was thinking about asking the maid to go back, there was movement in the front yard. Lu Wen himself used the secret door, and only Li Mingshan would go through the front door. This was the yard he bought. The front door was usually locked, so no one could find Lu Wen. Lu Wen lived here, and every time he wanted to find Lu Wen, sometimes Li Mingshan would go through the secret door. Lu Wen's classmate's elder brother and Li Mingshan were also classmates, so it was easier to get in and out under the name of a classmate.Sometimes he wanted to stay with Lu Wen for a while longer, but he felt that if the others knew and became his weaknesses for someone to take advantage of him. Li Mingshan would enter through the main entrance of the courtyard, and his classmates wouldn\u2019t know.Lu Wen greeted him from the room, saw the handsome Li Lang with a shy smile, and said, \"You're here.\"[\u90ce\u00a0l\u00e1ng: a youth]After drinking, Li Mingshan still smelled of powder on his body, but he was drunk now, and seeing Lu Wen, with a handsome and lovely appearance, he was so beautiful, he swallowed his saliva and walked forward, without even thinking about the aftertaste of the fragrance.\"Have you been drinking?\" Seeing that his cheeks were flushed, Lu Wen still didn't suspect anything. Drinking was not a big deal, so he asked with concern.It was just that after asking, before hearing Li Mingshan's words, as soon as he got close, Lu Wen smelled the scent of powder on his body, and his face became hesitant.However, Li Mingshan didn't know it, and he read two sour poems, praising Lu Wen's beauty. In the past, Lu Wen liked this kind of thing the most, so he must be shy.Lu Wen originally wanted to make him a bowl of hangover tea, but he stopped talking. The smell of cosmetics became more and more annoying, and finally he couldn't help but ask with reddened eyes: \"Why is there a scent of powder on your body? Could it be, could it be there is someone else.\"He was about to cry with red eye circles, he was so pitiful that Li Mingshan immediately wanted to wipe his tears away, and wanted to hide this smell from himself, so anxious that he didn't know what to say.Lu Wen burst into tears, and asked again: \"Or, you went to drink flower wine.\"Li Mingshan's heart was agitated immediately, and he lied all over his mouth, he said: \"Why do you say this? My heart to you, don\u2019t you know? I\u2019m not going to hide it from you, today they got up and dragged me to the brothel for a drink. I couldn\u2019t help it, so I had to go.\u201dHearing this, Lu Wen was stunned, and the tears were like a broken thread. Li Mingshan hurriedly said: \"They poured me wine and brought prostitutes to serve me. I couldn't refuse. I drank a few glasses, but don't complain. They slept with prostitutes in their arms. I don't want to to do such dirty things, I quickly escaped, and I was thinking about not seeing you for a few days, so I came to see you.\"\"Really?\" Lu Wen was relieved when he heard this, it was broad daylight now, Li Mingshan came to look for him, he believed most of it in his heart.\"Really, if it's not true, I will be struck by thunder...\" Before Li Mingshan could finish his sentence, Lu Wen covered his mouth.\"Don't say that, I believe you, otherwise, you just make my heart hurt.\" Lu Wen's tears stopped, and he looked like he loved Li Mingshan wholeheartedly.With the beauty covering his mouth, and the fragrance in his weak and boneless hands, Li Mingshan immediately became lustful. He had been with Lu Wen for so long, and he really made him as a treasure. That Bu Zicheng was also blind, he took a prostitute who how many men he had slept with to exchange for\u00a0 Lu Wen with him. But he had never touched him before, so how could he make it easier for others.The more he thought about it, the angrier he became, but Bu Zicheng wasn't around, so he couldn't scold him, and now that the beauty was in front of him, he didn't want to be distracted.The desire in the brothel came up again, Li Mingshan still pretended to be noble, and said: \"You don't know, there is something about the wine in the brothel, which makes people feel uncomfortable after drinking it. I\u2019m too uncomfortable. They stuffed me with a prostitute to relieve myself, but I didn't want to, I pushed people away and ran away, and I didn't know what to do on the way, so I came to find you.\"\"Good Lu Wen, please be considerate and considerate of me.\" Li Mingshan couldn't help begging, He even made an oath that he would never betray him, that he would go to the Lu family to propose marriage, and made Lu Wen the young fulang of the Li family.Hearing that Li Mingshan was so loyal to him, that he could break free and come to look for him after drinking the drugged wine, Lu Wen felt both ashamed and happy, and when he heard that he could be the young fulang of the Li family, he felt that this life was complete. He was poor, but he determined to study hard, he finally found a good confidant like Li Lang to rely on.After making a promise and making an oath, Li Mingshan half-coaxed the blushing Lu Wen into the room.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If the old lady of the Li family knew, even if the quarrel in the street was not his fault, then the fact that theShen family had entanglements with him before, and he had made an appointment with Shen Xuanqing, it must not be known by the Li family, otherwise it would be bad for the marriage.So he took a break from his thoughts for a while, even after the cloud and rain, he didn't say anything when the affection was strong and tender, he just snuggled to Li Mingshan and intentionally or unintentionally mentioned something about getting married as soon as possible.Li Mingshan was very tender-hearted towards him, and he agreed with all his heart. Lu Wen was even happier. He thought that after getting married, he would become the young fulang of the Li family. It was not too late to give them a small punishment.Lu Gu didn't know anything about the people and things in the town. These days, the whole family was busy threshing the rice, separating the chaff and grain, sifting with the ox, and finally pounding the rice to remove the bran, so that the new rice could come out. Couldn\u2019t think about anything else.The weather was beautiful. The sun was hot recently, and the rice was not afraid of sprouting when it was dried. It was hot and tired, but they were happy to grab a handful of white and clean new rice.Farm work was not exhausting. In front of the gate of Shen\u2019s courtyard, Lu Gu raised a dustpan to separate the grains. There was a lot of dust on his face and hands. He stopped to take a rest when it was too hot. He raised his arms and wiped his sweat with his sleeves. When he was about to get busy again, Shen Xuanqing spoke.\"You, mother, and Shen Yan all take a break. There are not many left. Brother Daqing and I are fine. The sun was good these few days, so don't be too anxious.\"Shen Xuanqing said, and took his dustpan. After leaving, Lu Gu couldn't work anymore, so he had to go back to the courtyard to rest according to his words.\"Mother, are you hungry? Let's have a steamed bun first.\" Ji Qiuyue was cooking and asked when she saw them coming in.Tired all morning, Wei Lanxiang replied: \"Yes, let's wash our faces and eat.\"Lu Gu scooped water for the three of them to wash their hands and faces, rubbed wild bath beads in their hands, and closed their eyes tightly. Washed the white foam on the face, and the dirt would be removed.Ji Qiuyue brought them the lukewarm but soft steamed buns, pickles, and cut a few salted duck eggs for them to eat.Duck egg yolks were poked with chopsticks to produce a red oily juice. It was not too salty, and it went well with the steamed buns and the pickled vegetables. If you didn\u2019t have chicken eggs, you could eat duck eggs to make up for the tiredness of the past few days.Lu Gu ate half of the salted duck egg very cleanly, and in the end there was only half an empty shell, and there was no residue left. He was still thinking in his heart that salted eggs were delicious, and when the ducks he raised lay eggs next year, he would also make salted eggs for Shen Xuanqing to eat.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There were chaff and rice bran on the ground outside the village. These chaff were not thrown away. Every family swept it and saved them to feed chickens, ducks, cattle and sheep. Poor people didn\u2019t dare to throw it away, rice bran was something that could satisfy hunger and satiety.After getting up early and eating, Lu Gu chopped up a large dustpan of grass, mixed it with chaff, and took it to the backyard to feed the chickens and ducks.\u00a0The pup followed him, because it would bite chickens and ducks, Lu Gu had no choice but to ask Shen Yan to take it away and play in the front yard.Harvesting autumn rice was busy at home. Before going down the mountain, Shen Xuanqing told him that he would stay at home for a half months. He was worried about the chickens and ducks. When he went down the mountain, he locked the chickens and ducks in a bamboo cage and pulled them down with the cart. Now it was only half grown, no bigger than a hen, and it could fit in a bamboo cage.The hens were cooing and the ducks were quacking. They were kept separately in two fence. After he poured the food for the chickens, he poured it for the ducks. Finally he turned over the bamboo dustpan and patted it on the back to remove the residue.With an empty dustpan in one hand, he counted the chickens and ducklings who were pecking at their food, and he was relieved when he saw that none of them were missing, but he watched the limp chick in the corner, why was there blood on its body?Lu Gu became a little anxious, went in and caught the chick, and found that it had wounds on the back of its neck and the base of its wings, and its feathers were stained with blood.What should he do? Did he want to get some medicine? Thinking about it, he looked carefully at the other chickens and ducklings. Fortunately, only this one was injured, so he hurriedly grabbed the chick and went to the front yard.Shen Xuanqing was entering the door with Shen Yaoqing, they had just gone out to inquire about the price of new rice, and they negotiated to bring some new rice to the town to sell in the next two days when the price was good, when they looked up, they saw Lu Gu's anxious expression.\"What's the matter?\" Shen Xuanqing's eyes fell on the chicken in his hand, and he stepped forward to check the injury, and finally said: \"It's okay, it's just a small injury, it must have been pecked by a big chicken, don't worry, get some medicine and it wil be allright.\"Lu Gu also thought that it should be the big chicken who bullied his little chicken, the big dog wouldn\u2019t bite, and the puppy had been in the front yard today, so it could only be the big chicken.\"Can I separate them?\" Lu Gu asked in a low voice, the chickens were not raised in one litter, so he thought it was better to separate them.Shen Xuanqing couldn't help it, and said: \"Okay, I'll go to set the fence. The old fence that I pulled out before hadn\u2019t been burned, so it's good to simply surround it. It doesn't need to be too much trouble, and we will go up in a few days.\"Shen Yan was sitting on the eaves, she was doing needlework, and the puppy was biting the leg of the stool she was sitting on. Hearing what they said, she interjected and said, \"Brother Guzi, there are medicine for bleeding on the hillside behind, and I will pick it for you.Lu Gu nodded hastily, put the chicken in the bamboo basket, and said, \"I'll go with you.\"When\u00a0the two of them came back from picking the medicine, Shen Yan smashed it with the stone to make a green medicine juice, and Lu Gu carefully found a piece of rag, since when he put the medicine on, the chick would shake and the medicine would fall off, so it was better to wrap it around.After the two of them finished, Shen Xuanqing also set up a small fence in the backyard, drove the chickens and ducks into it, and separated them from the big ones.\u00a0Lu Gu put the injured one in as well.He originally wanted to keep the injured one alone in the front yard, but seeing the lively and sturdy appearance of the pup that could only bite the leg of the stool, so he had no choice but to give up.Speaking of which, the cub was quite close to Lu Gu. Once Shen Xuanqing left on the mountain, there were only the two of them left. Compared to the chickens and ducks, the cub really looked like a child. He followed Lu Gu wherever he went, with a pair of bright black eyes open. He tilted his eyes and barked a few times, his small ears swayed with his head, sometimes his fat little paws would step on his shoe uppers, and his fat and round body, not to mention it was very cute.When Lu Gu returned to the front yard, the pup who had been yelled at by Dahui didn\u2019t dare to go to Dahui again. It found a corner and lay down, with its small head resting on its two front paws. His eyes looked pitiful and aggrieved.Seeing this, Lu Gu walked over, knelt down in front of it, patted its head, and lightly squeezed one of its ears, and said, \"If you are a good boy, Dahui won't mad at you.\"No one spoke to him in the mountains, sometimes the cub was too naughty, he couldn't help but to hug it and say a few words, the cub was not human, even if he didn't understand what he was talking about, he would still wag his little tail and tilt his head to listen.As Lu Gu said, he picked the pup from the ground, turned his head and saw Shen Xuanqing coming out of the main room, and stood there in a little embarrassed, thinking that no one would talk to a dog like him, if he was heard, they would definitely laugh at him.The pup was touched and hugged, and the grievance disappeared. He barked twice in his arms, licked his fingers, played with him and bit him a few times. It was tickle but it didn't hurt.Shen Xuanqing did hear Lu Gu talking to the pup. Lu Gu usually had a low voice, or he would lower his head and talk in such a low voice, looking timid, and whispered to the pup, but Shen Xuanqing felt that it seemed a little different, so he looked at Lu Gu subconsciously.Compared to him, Lu Gu seemed to be more comfortable with the puppy.After noticing Lu Gu's embarrassment, Shen Xuanqing narrowed his gaze, he thought for a while and said, \"It's been so long since we carried it back, so we should give it a name.\"He didn't mention what happened just now, and didn't laugh at him, letting Lu Gu quietly put back the raised heart, he thought for a while and couldn't figure it out, so he said: \"I don't understand this, you give it.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He had never studied, so it was not convenient to call him by a polite name.Guaizi, Lu Gu said the name, hugged the pup and called out Guaizi, but the pup was busy biting his sleeve and didn't respond to the name.Shen Xuanqing saw it and said: \"He will know after barking for a while.\"\"Yes.\" Lu Gu nodded, his sleeves were full of drool, and he put the pup down.At the time of You shi (5-7 pm), the sun was slowly setting towards the west, a fire was set up in the yard, and the firewood was crackling. Lu Gu and Ji Qiuyue sat in front of the small fire and roasted some autumn rice fishes.Shen Yan pierced a slightly bigger one with a clean wooden branch, and even rubbed pounded prickly ash powder and chili powder on the belly of the fish, and she also leaned forward to roast it.This was what Shen Yaoqing asked to make. He said that he often ate stewed fish, and he was tired of it, so he wanted to eat it differently.\u00a0Country people sometimes catched some fishes in the river, and they were reluctant to fry or stew them with salt, so they simply build a fire by the river and eat them casually, just to fill their stomachs.They were grilling fish at home, what to do if they were tasteless, so they took out the pepper powder and chili powder according to what Shen Yaoqing said. The autumn rice fish hadn't been eaten two days ago, so they killed it for fear that it would stink. Wrapped it with coarse salt, and now you didn't need to spread salt when it was baked on the fire.The three of them grilled together for a while, Ji Qiuyue saw that Shen Yan's fish had turned black, and said quickly: \"It's burnt, lift it up.\u201dThe spicy and numbing smell from the grilled fish was delicious, so she said: \"Sister-in-law, let me taste whether it was done or not.\" , but it failed to stop the greedy Shen Yan.\"It's quite delicious outside.\" Shen Yan tore some burnt fish meat, it wasn't completely black, it was different from the usual stewed fish, the fish skin was a bit dry and crisp, the salt taste was enough, and the pepper and chili were added, it tasted delicious, slightly numb and slightly spicy.\"It's okay, you eat it while roasting, and you'll finish eating after roasting.\" Ji Qiuyue joked with her with a smile.Wei Lanxiang came out of the room when she heard the commotion, and was happy to see them talking and laughing, so she brought a stool over and baked one too.Shen Yaoqing caught a lot of autumn rice fishes in the fields, and he ate the rest today, so it didn\u2019t take a space in the kitchen, and if he wanted to eat fish in the future, he would go to the river to catch the fresh ones.The pup smelled the scent and approached, Lu Gu was afraid that the fire would burn it, so he stopped it with his feet, but luckily it didn't jump into the fire, it must have seen the power of the flames.Wei Lanxiang glanced outside the door and said, \"Daqing and the others should be back.\"\"Yes, when they went out, Daqing said that he will be back around this time.\" Ji Qiuyue said, turning the wooden sticks so that the fish could cook evenly.Although Lu Gu didn't speak, he also glanced outside the door.Shen Xuanqing went to the town to sell new rice. The two brothers, one pulled the cart and the other pushed it behind, which was lighter than one person.While talking, Dahui, who was lying down and sleeping, raised his head and yelled at the door twice, then got up and ran out. Wei Lanxiang knew at a glance that his sons had returned.Not long after, Shen Yaoqing came in with an empty cart, he smelled the smell of grilled fish and said with a smile: \"Coincidentally, it just happened to be back.\"Ji Qiuyue laughed at him: \"Just worry about your greed.\"Shen Xuanqing followed, he came in from behind, he immediately met Lu Gu who was looking outside the door. Although the money for selling rice had nothing to do with him, it belonged to the eldest brother, but the family had a good harvest, and his fulang was also waiting for him at home, so he was in a good mood.Shen Yaoqing took care of the land, watering, weeding and fertilizing, he was mostly busy, Wei Lanxiang and Shen Yan were at home, and he and his wife took care of it more, so the harvest in the field was naturally in his hands, and the Shen family had no objection.At this moment, he didn't say much about the money when he came back from the sale. At night, he would pay Wei Lanxiang some money for the old lady's public money, and saved some money for himself, and his life would gradually get better.\"Go wash quickly, take the steamed buns and put them on the mat, this fish you can eat it with the skin.\" Wei Lanxiang said to them.The two brothers washed their hands and faces with water. Wei Lanxiang turned her head, the joy on her face was undiminished. The whole cart of rice was sold, and the price should be good.She turned the fish in her hand, thought for a while and said with a smile: \"Tomorrow, I will go to Da Chen's house to pick some long beans, fry them with red sauce, and fry an egg. I have saved some eggs these days. Let\u2019s steam dry rice tomorrow, and steam the new rice, try it out and be happy.\u201dThe long beans fried in red sauce was salty and delicious, and it was the best served with dry rice. Divide the sauce separately, and mixed them into the rice, which was very delicious, not to mention the steamed new rice, the grains were crystal clear and plump, and the steamed rice was also mellow and soft, and it was even delicious to eat plain rice without vegetables.Lu Gu had never eaten this dish, so he didn't know how delicious it was. Shen Yan had eaten it twice, and at the end of the meal, she took a piece of steamed bun and wiped off the remaining traces of the sauce on the bottom of the bowl, and she couldn't bear to let it go. It was also because she didn't eat much good food in the past two years, which made her felt that this dish was the most delicious, but now hearing that it would be eaten tomorrow, she swallowed greedily.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The puppy chewed several leaves of qiuchai (\u79cb\u83dc\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 qi\u016b c\u00e0i: autumn vegetables).The vegetables grown by the country people were expensive, and their family was better, so there was no shortage of this kind of food, otherwise the pup's fat buttocks would suffer.Lu Gu heard the movement and looked out of the kitchen. Ji Qiuyue took the puppy out and knocked on his forehead with her fingers as a small punishment, and also to make him a memory, remembering that the food shouldn\u2019t be spoiled casually.The pup was knocked and barked in pain. He was still young, unlike the big dogs who didn\u2019t dare to look at people or make noise when they made mistakes. Lu Gu was not worried at all when he saw this. He was so fat that even if he fell and knocked he would be allright, the skin was strong enough to withstand beatings, and Ji Qiuyue didn't hit him hard enough.Shen Xuanqing came out of the woodshed with a pile of furs in his arms, and the qiuchai that the puppy had been scurrying about in the vegetable field were there. He glanced at him and said, \"It's better to let the Dahui out and teach him, so as not to waste things when you were too busy to take care of him. \"Ji Qiuyue put the puppy on the ground, she heard the words, nodded and replied: \"That's right, we didn't watch him just now, let him play by himself.\"Seeing Shen Xuanqing holding the fur, she asked him: \"Why do you think of cleaning this?\"\"I'm free these two days, it's time to visit shifu (\u5e08\u7236\u00a0sh\u012b fu: teacher, master) and pick some good ones for him.\" Shen Xuanqing squatted down, too lazy to pick the furs on the pile of firewood.\"It's time to go.\" As Ji Qiuyue said, she heard Shen Yaoqing calling her in the room, saying that he couldn't find the bunt to carry the big bag, so she hurried into the room to help find it.When Lu Gu came out of the kitchen after washing the dishes, the puppy was chasing after him, trying to bite his trousers, he was really like a monkey.After selling the rice yesterday, there was no other work at home. The busy autumn harvest was over.Now they didn\u2019t have to work anymore after eating, and they could take a rest.As soon as Lu Gu came out and saw Shen Xuanqing picking up fur in front of the woodpile, he hesitated, it was okay when there was work to do, even if he was with Shen Xuanqing, he was busy, and the two of them were more comfortable together, but there was nothing to do at this time, he didn't dare to go to Shen Xuanqing, he turned his footsteps, and went to the room to get the needles and threads to make the sachet these days.The pile of fur mostly rabbits fur. The rabbits fur killed by the family, they didn't throw it away. They dried and kept it. It didn't matter whether they sold it later or made some boots and leather jackets for winter.As for the rabbits that were sold in the town, it was not that he never thought of selling the fur and meat separately, so that he could earn more money. It was all lean meat, and its price was not as good as pork. It was even lighter if you peeled the skin and dug out the internal organs. If you couldn't sell it all in a day, it would attract flies. The people in the town were more particular.There were also people who had a lot of things to pick and choose. He had tried to sell it like this twice and found it troublesome, so he wouldn\u2019t do it anymore. Anyway, the fur would be expensive to sell, so he wouldn\u2019t lose money.He kept three ugly furs, Shen Xuanqing tied up the rest and took the fur to the old hunter for the winter.The sun was shining outside, Lu Gu was sitting under the eaves embroidering sachets, and the puppy was playing in front of him, Shen Yan felt less uncomfortable after walking around for a while, and leaned over to look at the things Lu Gu embroidered.Shen Xuanqing went to the room where the grain was stored and brought out a sack of new rice, put it on the cart, and took a bamboo basket to hold hazelnuts and chestnuts, and filled a basket.The old hunter loved to eat the wild tea in the mountains. He took a cloth bag and poured it into a bag, and kept some for his family. This kind of thing could be found in the mountains, and he could pick it when he wanted to drink it.The goji berries were also packed, and even a lot of wild bath beads, which he picked with Lu Gu before going down the mountain, and they brought back a lot, the wild bath beads could be stored for a long time as long as they didn't get wet. Seeing him putting everything on the cart, Wei Lanxiang came over to take a look and said, \" The qiuchais are mature recently, dig some and bring them to your shimu (\u5e2b\u6bcd\u00a0sh\u012b m\u01d4: term of respect for your teacher's wife) to try.\"It tasted good when you ate it cold. Almost every family in the countryside grew this stuff. It could be dried or pickled to eat in winter. They had a large vegetable field in the front yard, and they had planted a lot. They even cultivated a piece of land behind the house. No worry about eating.Wei Lanxiang said and went to dig qiuchai by herself, and said while digging: \"This year is not good, it\u2019s cold, and next summer, we will plant some winter melons and long beans, and then we will give it to your shifu.\"\"Well, we will grow more next year.\" Shen Xuanqing agreed, and took another cloth bag to pour chaidou (\u67f4\u8c46).Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They ate early today, and it was only noon now. Shen Xuanqing looked at the sky and said, \"Now that it's ready, just\u00a0\u00a0go after the sun is not so hot.\"Wei Lanxiang nodded, she glanced at Lu Gu, and asked, \"Are you alone or not?\"Shen Xuanqing also looked over, met the eyes of Lu Gu who raised his head, and said, \"Let's go, and see shifu and shimu.\"\"Well, it's a long way to go, it's good to have a companion, come back tomorrow night, I'll leave some food for you two.\" Wei Lanxiang said while washing her hands.When Lu Gu heard that he wouldn\u2019t be back until tomorrow, and he had never met Shen Xuanqing's shifu and shimu, he couldn't help but felt a little uneasy. Now Shen Yan couldn't bear it anymore, so she took the embroidery frame and asked him to teach embroidery and he got busy talking so he slowly forgot about his anxiety.After noon, the sun was not so bright, so he packed up and went out with Shen Xuanqing.\"Shifu and the others live in Jixing Town. After passing Fenggu Town, it\u2019s about 20 miles away, which is far away.\" Shen Xuanqing said while pulling the cart.Lu Gu nodded. It was indeed far away. Their Qingxi Village was more than ten miles away from Fenggu Town, and they arrived in three quarters of an hour.\u00a0Jixing Town was on the other side of Fenggu Town, he had only heard of it.Knowing that he had never traveled far, Shen Xuanqing comforted him again: \"It's not urgent, you don't need to hurry too much. If you're tired, take a rest halfway, and you'll be there when you walk.\"Apart from his apprehension, the farthest places he had been to were Fenggu Town in the south and Niujia village in the west. He was still a little curious about Jixing Town in the south, wondering what the scene was like there.Lu\u00a0Gu was very familiar with the road to Fenggu Town. He was used to walk on mountain roads. This time, only Shen Xuanqing was pulling the cart. He didn\u2019t carry anything on his back. They walked slowly and even took a break on the road, so he didn\u2019t get tired.When they reached Fenggu town, Shen Xuanqing stopped and asked Lu Gu to watch the cart at the door when passing by the cloth shop. He went in and bought some cloth for his shimu.\u00a0The old hunter had furs, and his shimu was kind to him, so he had to make new clothes for the old lady.Lu Gu waited outside the door, picked up the bamboo tube and drank a couple of sips of water, Shen Xuanqing came out after buying the cloth, pulled up the cart and walked forward again.Coming out to the south of Fenggu Town, Lu Gu looked carefully and curiously at the places he passed. He had never been here before, and he felt strange.The two had to talk on the way. When passing through the village, Shen Xuanqing also told him the name of the place and the village, and said that although Jixing Town was far away from them, it was close to Yuqingfu City.The town was big enough and lively enough for Lu Gu, but now he couldn't even think of the more prosperous prefecture.Walking and resting along the way, after entering Changxing Street in Jixing Town, there were more and more people, Lu Gu approached Shen Xuanqing and the cart, he was not familiar with the place, so he was inevitably nervous when he came here for the first time, and he was a little afraid of being lost.The restaurants on the street were bustling, all kinds of shops were open, and the mellow oily smell was wafting from the oil mill, especially the sesame oil.\"We will go back and make some sesame oil. It will be more fragrant when we put it in the steamed custard.\" Shen Xuanqing turned his head and said to Lu Gu.Lu Gu carefully nodded his head and hummed, because a few people came across, and he got closer to Shen Xuanqing.He didn't notice it before, but now Shen Xuanqing saw it, and realized that he was timid, and his eyes were stained with a smile before he knew it, and he let Lu Gu approach him without saying a word.In front of a tavern\u2019s door there was a sign of wine, and some people were sitting inside. After Shen Xuanqing said \"here\", they stopped in front of the tavern.Xiaoer was about to come out to greet him, when he saw that it was Shen Xuanqing, he smiled courteously and said, \"So it's Brother Shen, I'll call the shopkeeper.\"Yang Xian came out quickly, and Shen Xuanqing pulled the cart, It was not good to stop in front of the tavern, and it would block the business. After asking if the old hunter was at home, he pulled the cart and headed towards the entrance of the alley.\"This is the new fulang?\" Yang Xian was pushing the cart on the other side. He was fairly handsome, with a beard, wearing a long gown and a hat, and he was friendly. He looked like a businessman.\"His name is Lu Gu, and this is Brother Yang Xian.\" After Shen Xuanqing finished speaking, Lu Gu called out in a low voice, timidity was timidity, and there was still a proper courtesy.Yang Xian nodded with a smile, he was a man, it was not easy to talk to Shuang'er, he still asked Shen Xuanqing, as for the doubts about the name Lu Gu, just asked in private.After entering the rather spacious alley, they arrived after five houses ahead. The slightly red-cheeked old Yang Tou sat while smoking on the rod at the door, taking out a few dates from his arms to amuse his grandchildren.\"Father, let's see who's here.\" Yang Xian shouted before he arrived.\"Shifu.\" Shen Xuanqing also shouted.Seeing his apprentice, Lao Yang felt happy all of a sudden, stopped smoking, tapped the cigarette on the wall, wrapped the cigarette bag around his waist, and stood up with a smile on his face.Shen Xuanqing pulled the cart to the front and stopped, and called Shifu again.Old Yangtou was about to talk to his apprentice, when he saw Lu Gu looking at him timidly, he also called out Shifu, his voice was a little bit softer, but he was even happier, the old man's face was full of wrinkles, this was his apprentice Fulang.\"Shifu, this is Lu Gu.\" Shen Xuanqing said before he spoke.Old Yangtou was always getting old, but he was not slow to react, the smile on his face didn't change, he said cheerfully: \"It's Guzi, your shimu is inside, just steamed pumpkin and dates, go in and eat.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When the younger brother, who was almost two years old, saw his sister went in, he also entered the courtyard like a bum beetle.\"Grandma, daddy said that Uncle Erqing is here.\" Ni'er was four years old and could speak clearly what adults needed her to say.An old lady came out of the kitchen. She seemed to be older than Wei Lanxiang, but she tidied up neatly and looked very energetic. She wiped her hands with her apron when she saw Lu Gu, and hesitated with a smile: \"This is...\"Ni\u2019er heard her father's words just now, she jumped\u00a0ahead of the adults and said triumphantly: \"Grandma, I know, this is my xiaoma Guzi.\"Yan Shi was stunned for a moment, when Shen Xuanqing came in with a cart and saw her in the yard.\u00a0Then he shouted: \"Mother \"[Yan Shi: After marrying,\u00a0a woman name become her father\u2019s surname and the affix \u201cshi,\u201d meaning clan/maiden name]\"Hey!\" Yan Shi was also happy to see Shen Xuanqing, and the little old lady laughed and scolded: \"My son said about you before, the second boy has no conscience, so he doesn't come to see mother.\"\"Am I not bringing my fulang to see you now?.\" Shen Xuanqing said with a smile after stopping.\"Mother.\" With this sentence, Lu Gu called out timidly. He knew the reason for the old lady's reaction and Shen Xuanqing's mention of his name several times, no matter how stupid he was.\"Okay, okay, I'm more happy you bring your fulang here.\" Yan Shi took Lu Gu's hand and patted it lovingly twice. Their second boy smiled so handsomely and looked at fulang differently, so she didn't care Why Ahwen (Lu Wen) became Guzi (Lu Gu).\"There is no shortage of food on the road. mother steamed pumpkins and dates, sat down to rest and eat.\" Yan Shi said, pushing Lu Gu on the stone bench in the yard and let him sit down, and she hurried to the kitchen to get food and drink.Yang Xian and Shen Xuanqing unloaded things from the trolley, saw a basket of mixed hazelnuts and chestnuts, he said with a smile: \"Bring so many, why don't you keep some for home?\"\"There are still some at home, bring some for you to try \" Shen Xuanqing picked up the bag of wild tea, opened it to Lao Yangtou, he said, \"Shifu, this is a tea for you.\"[\u8001\u00a0lao: old (of people),\u00a0\u6768\u00a0yang: surname,\u00a0\u5934\u00a0tou: the head, chief, boss]Lao Yang took a look inside and saw that it was his favorite wild tea. How could he be unhappy.\"And this one, it's a fur coat for winter, the one in the front was old.\" Shen Xuanqing showed him the rabbit fur again.Seeing his apprentice cared for him so much, Lao Yang was so happy that his eyes became smaller, and he couldn't help but said yes.Yan Shi brought pumpkins and dates for Lu Gu, and made two bowls of honey water for him and Shen Xuanqing to drink. When she heard that there was something for Lao Yang, she told Lu Gu to try it quickly, and walked to the cart to see if there was any for her.Shen Xuanqing knew she was waiting when he saw her expression, and said with a smile: \"Aniang, this medlar is often soaked to drink, it\u2019s good for the body, and there are also wild bath beads, which my fulang picked and brought a lot. The qiucai at home were dug by my mother, let you try something new.\"After telling her this, Shen Xuanqing took out the cloth and said: \"This cloth is for you to make new clothes for you. There are a lot of furs for the master, and there are still some furs left, you can make a pair of fur shoes and wear them for warmth in winter.\"The old lady took the cloth from him with a smile, and complained: \"I just said, you only remember the old man and don\u2019t think about me.\u201dThe cloth was very good, thick and comfortable, Yan Shi turned to the side when Lao Yang came over to look at it, stared and didn\u2019t let him touch the cloth, thinking his hands were dirty, she hurried into the room and put it in the box, and brought Lu Gu some pastries and dried fruits when she came out again.When Ni\u2019er saw the sweet cake, she clamored to eat it. Lu Gu took a piece for her and her younger brother. She ate the sweet cake and went to the cart to have a look. There were so many chestnuts and hazelnuts in the tall bamboo basket that her mouth was open. She had eaten both, so she knew they were edible.Shen Xuanqing and Yang Xian carried the rice down, as well as the two live bamboo chickens with their feet tied. Looking down, they saw the fat baby in front of the bamboo basket reaching in and grabbing a handful of chestnuts and hazelnuts. She was only four years old, no matter how big she was, she could only grab two.Ni\u2019er held the chestnut and looked up at him, hiding her fat hands behind her back. She knew that the things belonged to someone else, so she felt a little guilty when someone found it.\"Eat.\" Shen Xuanqing said with a smile, and asked her again: \"Will you peel it?\"He smiled, and Ni'er smiled too, took a bite of the sweet cake and shook her head, and said vaguely in her mouth: \"No, but my grandpa can peel it.\"Shen Xuanqing took a chestnut from the basket while she was talking, peeled it a few times and handed it to her, Ni\u2019er still held the pastry in her right hand, so she had to put the two chestnuts in her left hand back into the bamboo basket.\"Chestnuts are raw, you can only eat one, and the hazelnuts will be knocked and eaten by Grandpa.\" After Shen Xuanqing finished speaking, he saw her bulging cheeks, and she was busy eating, but he didn't know if she listened.\"Second boy, wash your hands quickly, sit down and rest.\" Yan Shi asked Yang Xian to carry all the things into the grain room, and she fetched water for Shen Xuanqing to wash.Lu Gu sat in front of the stone table, the younger brother finished eating the sweet cake, he spoke late, not very quick, pointed to the cake on the table and looked at Lu Gu, motioned for him to take it and said: \"Eat, eat.\"\"Ouch , you still eat, how much you have eaten this day.\" When Yan Shi heard that her grandson still wanted to eat, she only broke off a small piece.In the alley next door, the little grandson of the Wang family ate too much and went to the doctor crying and complaining because of stomachache. She was not afraid of her grandson eating, but she was afraid of him getting hurt. That was called suffering.Shen Xuanqing washed his hands and sat down next to Lu Gu, Yan Shi dismissed her grandson and also sat down to talk to her second boy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Shen Xuanqing worshiped Lao Yangtou as his shifu at the age of ten, and Yan Shi was still living with Lao Yangtou in Qingxi Village at that time.Shen Xuanqing was a handsome boy when he was a child, he grew tall since he was a child, and he was flexible in running and jumping. Lao Yang saw that he was a piece of material, so he not only taught him hunting skills, but also taught him some fists, feet and sticks.After worshiping as a teacher, he often went to Lao Yangtou's house. Yan Shi saw that he was Junsheng. After a long time, she treated Shen Xuanqing as half of her son, and it was strange to call her shimu, so she simply asked Shen Xuanqing to call her mother.[\u4fca\u00a0j\u00f9n: smart; eminent; handsome; talented,\u00a0\u751fsh\u0113ng: to be born; to give birth; life; to grow]At that time, Wei Lanxiang was not happy because of this matter, why did her youngest son call someone else mother, but seeing that Lao Yangtou and Yan Shi were both good to Shen Xuanqing, sometimes she didn't need her own mother to control the food and drink, and even made clothes for him, she had to give up and admit it.Shen Xuanqing was also smart, and when he realized it, he always talked good about his shimu in front of Wei Lanxiang.After three years of his apprenticeship with Lao Yang, Yang Xian's wife gave birth and had to be taken care of by someone, so Yan Shi had to come to Jixing Town, so she couldn't see her Erqing boy from a distance, and sometimes he kept talking about him.Another two years later, Lao Yang was getting older, and he had taught Shen Xuanqing everything he should have taught him. He had no one to cook in the village, and it was not decent to go to Shen's house to eat often. It was flourishing, and Yang Xian had money in his hands. Seeing that his father was getting old, he asked him to come to the town. It happened that he and his second brother both had children, so he let the old man and the old lady who had nothing to do to play with their grandchildren and enjoy themselves.At that time, Shen Xuanqing's father was gone, some money for seeing a doctor and getting medicine was given by the old hunter, and later Wei Lanxiang asked him to borrow the money for the good medicine and hanging his father\u2019s life. After Shen Shunfu left, Lao Yang went to town, Shen Xuanqing had been away from his shifu since then, busy helping his family to earn money to pay off the debts.In the past three years when Shen's family still busy to pay off the debts, their young daughter-in-law had another child to take care of, and Yan Shi was still worried about her grandson. She was so busy that she only went back twice, carrying meat and eggs, and urging Lao Yang to drive the donkey cart.Before going back for the first time, she knew that the second wife of the Shen family was not doing well, and she already knew it, but when she really saw her dark and skinny second boy, she wiped her tears and cried, he was so thin as if he had never eaten meat, she felt so uncomfortable.She was old, had an illness, and the donkey cart was bumpy. After seeing Shen Xuanqing twice, she never went back. She either scolded Lao Yang to bring meat and food back to Qingxi Village, or called Yang Xian to go.This summer, when Shen Xuanqing got married, she went back to live in Shen's house for two days. On the day he married his fulang, after the feast, Yang Xian was busy going back to the town to take care of the tavern, and then drove back with his family.\u00a0Besides their rules here, the bridegroom was covered with a veil, which had to be uncovered by the groom. After the family members had seen him, they didn't go out to meet outsiders the next day.Jixing Town was far away, so the Yang family didn't know what happened after they got married.While talking and laughing, a slightly plump woman came in from outside the door, and Yan Shi quickly said: \"Ni\u2019er\u2019s mother, let's see who is coming, Erqing and his fulang called Guzi.\"Zhang Shi came back after buying hair oil. She was also a very kind person. Knowing that her mother-in-law regarded Shen Xuanqing as her son, she said with a smile: \"Erqing and Guzi are here, hurry up and sit down. It's a coincidence that we will go to the tavern tonight to eat.\"\"Look, Ni'er loves to eat chestnuts and hazelnuts, all of which are brought by the second boy, a sack of new rice and goji berries, etc. I took some old ones, and carried them into the house.\" Yan Shi was even happier to hear her say that they would go to the tavern to eat. Her second boy was so filial, so everyone should know.When Zhang Shi saw the basket full of things, she really had a lot of thoughts. She knew that the Shen family hadn\u2019t been doing well in the past three years. Most of the time, the old lady scolded and asked her to make up for her precious second boy. A lot, but it's all for nothing.She didn't say it to the old lady, she just figured it out in her heart, and sometimes she felt uncomfortable and had a calculation with Yang Xian, but Yang Xian was filial and refused to disobey the old lady's wishes, so he could only comfort her and let her open some.Looking at the kitchen now, there were a lot of qiucai, and there were two pheasants outside the kitchen. Shen Xuanqing presumably brought them here. After thinking about bringing so many things here, it seemed that the Shen family was not the white-eyed wolf that she thought before.Although Zhang Shi had a bit of a plan, she was not a bad person. People treated her well and she treated others well. Now the kind smile on her face became sincere, and she smiled in response to Yan Shi's words: \"Erqing is tired all the way, I come back to see Aunt Wang\u2019s house picking sour fruit at the entrance of the alley, I want some for you to try.\u201dShe put away the hair oil as she said that, and Ni\u2019er wanted to follow her.It was getting late, Yan Shi thought of something, got up and said to Shen Xuanqing beside her, \"Don't leave tonight, I will make a bed for you two, stay for two days.\"There was still a wink, so needless to say, he followed into the room and joined hands.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Originally, he wanted his wife and children to go together, but Yang Yi's wife had been ill these two days, and she had already taken the medicine and fell asleep, so he only brought the children over.Yang Yi studied well and was a scholar. Now he was teaching in the academy in Jixing Town. He and Yang Xian both practiced boxing and kicking with Lao Yangtou when they were young. He was also a man from the countryside, so even if he was wearing a green long robe, he was easy-going and his words were a bit refined, but he didn't seem to be as weak as some teachers.Lao Yangtou's second child was a girl and he also sent someone to call her. Yang Yujun married a butcher who sold meat in Jixing Town, and his life was good. When Yang Yi came from the west of the town, he met Yang Yujun and the butcher Qian, so they came together.LaoYangtou and Yan Shi were getting older, so they were naturally happy to see them, let alone Shen Xuanqing, a pro-disciple, it was even rarer, so naturally more people were needed to accompany her, especially Yan Shi, so that she could show off to others that the second boy was so filial.Shen Xuanqing brought a lot of things. Jixing Town was far away from the mountains, and mountain products were rare. Gave Yang Yi and Yang Yujun some to take back and taste, especially qiucai. There were so many they had dug, they were easy to get withered, it was better to divide them.They were all the sons and daughters of Lao Yangtou, and Shen Xuanqing had no objection to give some to them. He also knew that there were many Yang family members, so he specially brought these here.The chef cooked a table of special dishes, and the good wine was brought up. Everyone sat around, eating, drinking and laughing, which was extremely lively.Lu Gu sat next to Shen Xuanqing, he spoke cautiously, most of the time he just listened to others, Shen Xuanqing picked up a dish for him from time to time, when Yan Shi saw, she knew that the second boy would be considerate to his fulang.It was dark after the lively meal, and the group of people went to Yang Xian's house to sit and chat for a while. After drinking wine and eating meat, they became hot, so they lit lanterns and sat in the courtyard. Ni'er took her younger brother and cousin to have fun in the courtyard, adults were joking.Yan Shi also took out the cloth that Shen Xuanqing bought for her from the box to show off to her daughter, looked at how good the cloth was, and showed the fur of the rabbits. There were so many furs, and it cost a lot just to buy them outside. The furs were brought for the old man to make a pair of shoes for him, as well as those chestnuts and hazelnuts, which they brought in baskets for the second and third families to eat.As the night gradually deepened, Yang Yi and Yang Yujun left with a basket of Qiucai. Yang Xian still had a work to do in the tavern tomorrow, so Zhang Shi took the child to bed first.Lu Gu was also led by Yan Shi to wash his hands briefly, and he was still soaking his feet in the room to relieve fatigue. Yan Shi didn't care about Shen Xuanqing, but she cared about his fulang. She smiled and asked him to rest quickly after wiping his feet, and went out by herself.After the excitement was over, it felt a bit awkward to be alone in the room, but Lu Gu was indeed tired, so he lay down on the bed first.Shen Xuanqing was still talking to the old Orion in the yard, because everyone else had fallen asleep, so the shifu and apprentice were quiet.Everything in the mountains gradually had faded away for Lao Yangtou. When he was old, he always liked to talk about the old things. When he was young, hunting in the mountains was painful and tiring, but he brought his dogs to hunt and run in the mountains and shoot the prey with his bow. This kind of pleasure was unforgettable.His two sons both make a living in the town, and it was a pity that no one learned his hunting skills. He was already old when he took Shen Xuanqing in, and he had grown older in the past few years. It was still the same as before, when you went to the mountain, you could tell if there was something haunted at a glance, but after all, you were old, and you were no longer as brave and vigorous as you used to be.Lao Yang was smoking a cigarette, listening to Shen Xuanqing talking about what he had encountered in the mountains and how he caught them. In the dim light, his eyes were nostalgic, as if he had seen everything in the mountains and forests in these words.In the morning, Lu Gu woke up when he heard the movement outside. Last night, he didn't know how late\u00a0\u00a0Shen Xuanqing came to the room after he slept.Ni'er got up, and just got up to see if the uncle and xiaoma from yesterday were still there, Ni\u2019er yelled outside the door, Lu Gu was already dressed and got out of bed, he turned his head to see Shen Xuanqing sitting on the bed and put on his shoes, he quickly opened the door.Yan Shi was busy on the kitchen to boil water and heat up the foods. Ni\u2019er came in holding Lu Gu's hand. She looked curiously at Shen Xuanqing who stood up, and her eyes gradually moved up, even raising her head. This action made Shen Xuanqing laughed, and Lu Gu's eyes were also stained with a slight smile.Ni'er raised her head, he was too tall for her small body, maybe she felt tired, so she turned her head and said to Lu Gu: \"Xiaoma, I want to eat hazelnuts, but grandpa still didn't get up.\"She dragged Lu Gu out , the bamboo basket was on the table in the main room, so Lu Gu had no choice but to go with her.One big and one small squatted on the ground and knocked on the hazelnuts. Lu Gu looked at Ni\u2019er and remembered that Ni\u2019er called him Xiaoma. He didn't feel anything when he was called. Maybe he just woke up and didn't wake up completely. He suddenly felt that he really got married, it was like becoming an adult, and you would be called Xiaoma by children.Shen Xuanqing poured the hot water and called him to wash his face in the courtyard. Lu Gu's thoughts were interrupted. Before he got up, he couldn't help but touched Nier's chubby cheek.After staying in the Yang's house for a long time, after the afternoon sun was not so hot, Shen Xuanqing went back with Lu Gu.Yan Shi and LaoYang sent them out of the alley, and when they were about to send them off, Shen Xuanqing stopped them. The old man and the old lady were old, especially Yan Shi, whose legs were not as good as before. The daughter-in-law was busy in the tavern, and there were children to look after.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Shen Xuanqing stopped at the door after walking for a while, and went in to say goodbye to Yang Xian.When Lu Gu and Shen Xuanqing walked to the oil shop on Changxing Street, smelling the aroma of sesame oil, Shen Xuanqing stopped again to buy, they came out without a pot, and the bamboo tube was to hold water for drinking on the road. They bought some clay pots together, and kept some at home when they went back, and brought some to the mountain.It wasn\u2019t that they didn't have an oil shop, but since they passed here and the oil smelled really good, it was better to buy it.Pedestrians were in a hurry, and they were among them.Lu Gu followed Shen Xuanqing on the return road, and they didn\u2019t come back until the setting sun was shining, and it was dusk.\u00a0As soon as they came back, Wei Lanxiang made a fuss about serving food for the two of them, and they must be hungry after walking all this way.Shen Xuanqing took the clay pots to the kitchen. Wei Lanxiang, who was serving rice, smelled it and said with a smile, \"This sesame oil is really fragrant. I will steam an egg tomorrow. Let's pour some sesame oil on it and try it, Okay?\" she asked again.When the Yan Shi was still in Qingxi Village in the early years, she had a very good relationship with Wei Lanxiang. Later, Shen Xuanqing became his husband\u2019s apprentice. Even if there were occasional bickering and anger, it would be fine within two days.Shen Xuanqing nodded and said yes, and briefly told her about the people and things he saw in the past. When she heard that Ni\u2019er was chubby and cute, Wei Lanxiang said nothing, but she also wanted to hug her grandson and granddaughter in her heart.The days were getting better now, not to mention the second child, the eldest daughter-in-law should also have a baby, but this kind of thing couldn't be rushed even if it was urgent, she could only say something to the eldest son and the eldest daughter-in-law in private.His legs were tired from the journey, and Lu Gu was lying on the bed after washing at night. Speaking of which, he had only been in the Shen's house for a few months, and he stayed outside for the night last night.He looked at the top of the bed curtain and thought about something on his mind. For a while, he thought of the word \"go home\", and for a while it was something else, and it was difficult to fall asleep in a short time.The lights in the room hadn't been turned off yet, and Shen Xuanqing poured the foot washing water outside and came back.Lu Gu was already lying down, seeing him coming in now, he sat up with his arms propped up, hesitantly looked at the man beside the bed who wanted to blow the lamp.Seeing this, Shen Xuanqing didn't turn off the lights, and asked: \"What's the matter?\"Lu Gu who was worried didn\u2019t dare to look up, lowered his eyes and asked in a low voice: \"Are you going to the mountain tomorrow?\"\"Do you want to go or not?\" Shen Xuanqing asked him patiently.\"The day after tomorrow is my mother's death day.\" Lu Gu was a little nervous, but he still said: \"I want to go and see.\"Shen Xuanqing paused, and then said: \"Then wait until we go to the grave, and we will go the day after tomorrow. I will take you with me tomorrow, go buy yellow paper ingots.\"Lu Gu looked at him, full of gratitude, and finally gave a solemn \"um\" with a nasal voice.On the day of Lu Gu mother's death, he and Shen Xuanqing went to the grave on the hillside behind Anjia Village with bamboo baskets carrying offerings, yellow paper, joss sticks and other things.When he was thinking about things alone, he thought about it, now that he had money in his hand, he must burn a lot of paper money and ingots for his mother, so that his mother could have money to spend underground.\u00a0He didn't dare to bother Shen Xuanqing originally, but Shen Xuanqing wanted to take him to buy it. He bought a lot and brought some offerings.The grass on the grave was taller, and it was not autumn yet, and hadn\u2019t dry yet. There was no one in the Lu family to take care of it, so Lu Gu and Shen Xuanqing pulled the grass on the grave first.Because it was Lu Gu\u2019s mother, Shen Xuanqing knelt beside Lu Gu, took a branch and set the fire together, and added paper money and ingots to it.\"Mom, with so much money, you can buy whatever you want, don't worry, I dried the goji berries myself, I'll burn some for you, and you can taste them, and there are also hazelnuts and chestnuts, which I picked up in the mountains. I ate a lot of them, you eat too.\"\"Gongguo.\" Lu Gu turned his head to look at Shen Xuanqing, choked slightly and said, \"Erqing brought you the Gongguo, you can eat it if you want, it's all yours.\u201d[\u4f9b\u679c\u00a0g\u00f2ng guo: the fruits for sacrificial offering]His eyes were moist and he said: \"There is also new rice. This year we have harvested a lot of new rice and steamed it to eat. It\u2019s very delicious. I ate several bowls, and Erqing bring it for you when we come.\"The offerings were made, and the burnings were finished. Lu Gu wiped away his tears and was about to kowtow when Shen Xuanqing spoke.\"Mother, don't worry, I will take good care of Guzi, let him eat and wear warm.\"Lu Gu didn't expect Shen Xuanqing to call his mother, and he was stunned with tears in his eyes. It was Shen Xuanqing who told him after speaking. It was time to kowtow, and only then did he come back to his senses.After getting up, Lu Gu bent slightly to pat the dirt on his legs, and couldn't hold back his tears fell straight to the ground, but he kept silent, Shen Xuanqing only realized it when he saw the teardrops falling on the ground.The last time he saw Lu Gu crying was because he accidentally dropped the egg, but he didn't cry for a long time, and it wasn't like now, obviously he didn't make a sound, but the tears couldn't stop.After Lu Gu straightened up, he still lowered his head, he wanted to slow down, but when he thought of the word \u201cmother\u201d just now, he still burst into tears.Shen Xuanqing had never seen such a battle before, the almost seven-foots-tall man was at a loss, and went to wipe the water on Lu Gu's face clumsily.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The tall man was usually rough, so he looked a little at a loss since he had never done such a delicate job of coaxing people.The tears kept flowing and he couldn't wipe them away, Shen Xuanqing was anxious, but in the end he had no choice but to hold Lu Gu tightly and clumsily.The face being pressed against the strong and broad chest was no stranger to Lu Gu. Shen Xuanqing often hugged him when he slept at night, but never during the day, after all, it was broad daylight.The tears on his face were all rubbed on Shen Xuanqing's clothes, he slowly stopped crying after he noticed it, it would be bad if it got dirty.After regaining his senses, Lu Gu felt embarrassed, crying so much that he didn't know if Shen Xuanqing would dislike him or scold him.As soon as this idea came out, it was rejected in his heart. If Shen Xuanqing despised him, why would he hug him, without a word of reprimand or abuse.Hugging this kind of thing was certainly embarrassing for Lu Gu. It could be said that except for Shen Xuanqing, no one had hugged him like this.He was familiar with the smell of the tall man, the faint breath of the wild bath beads was warm, mixed with the strong and vigorous masculinity, the smell was indescribably reliable and reassuring.Lu Gu was ashamed and didn't dare to move, and wanted to step back, but Shen Xuanqing hugged him.The helplessness in the depths of his heart found a stable place at this moment. His fingertips trembled slightly, but he still couldn't hold back. He boldly grabbed a bit of fabric at Shen Xuanqing's waist and held it tightly, as if he used a lot of strength, but he still didn't dare to squeeze too much.Lu Gu didn't move much in his arms, but Shen Xuanqing could feel that he was no longer crying, so he sighed very lightly, hugged him, and the stiffness and clumsiness just now disappeared, this was his fulang, now there were no outsiders watching, so what if you hugged him.Shen Xuanqing slowly let go of him when he realized that it had been delayed for a long time.Lu Gu lowered his head and wiped the remaining traces of water on his face with his sleeve, Shen Xuanqing carried the bamboo basket on his back, and the two walked back.After the mood calmed down, Lu Gu's eyes were still red, and he walked about halfway, raised his eyes to see Shen Xuanqing's face, who knew that he was caught right away, and slammed into those star eyes.He was a little flustered, but before he could look away, he saw Shen Xuanqing smiled helplessly, and said: \"You don't need to be afraid of me, whatever you want to do in the future, just open your mouth, I'm not someone else, I won't hold you back.\"The deep voice was indescribably pleasant, Lu Gu sniffed lightly, and his eyes were a little sore after hearing this, but he didn't cry, he just nodded his head heavily, and gave a nasal \"huh\".As he walked, Lu Gu thought about everything that happened after he arrived at Shen's house, and Shen Xuanqing's words just now, his heart was inevitably sour, and this sourness made him wanted to grab Shen Xuanqing's clothes again, but he himself didn't know why.They hadn\u2019t arrived at Qingxi Village yet, the autumn harvest was over, and there were few people on the road, Shen Xuanqing was beside him, Lu Gu couldn't hold back, and quietly raised his hand to hold some fabric from Shen Xuanqing's clothes.After holding it, he himself was too flustered. Seeing someone approaching from a distance, he was so frightened that he quickly let go.After realizing what he did just now, it was so outrageous, Lu Gu lowered his head and didn't dare to lift his head, for fear of being ridiculed for being out of order.When\u00a0the corner of his clothes was being pinched and held by his fulang, even if only for a moment, Shen Xuanqing was stunned for a moment, and smiled brighter than when he was married.Fortunately, he knew that Lu Gu's face was too thin, and he would be overwhelmed with fright if he took a second glance, so he didn't speak, only the smile on his face didn\u2019t disappear.After returning to the village, even the familiar men of the same age in Qingxi Village were a little surprised to see him like this, and those who didn't know thought that whether he had encountered some great thing or he had gotten rich.After finishing all the things that should be busy, Lu Gu and Shen Xuanqing packed the next day and went to the mountain again. It was mid-morning when they left, and as soon as they went out to the north hillside, there were red persimmons hanging from the persimmon tree outside the mud wall of the north of Shen's house.Wei Lanxiang saw it and said, \"The persimmons are ripe, bring some for you two.\"\"Mother, there are some on the mountain, no need.\" Shen Xuanqing didn't go to pick them, and the wild persimmons in the mountains were beginning to ripen, and the taste was not much different , they were all sweet persimmons, why bother to pull the ones from the bottom of the mountain to the top of the mountain.Lu Gu had been in the mountains with Shen Xuanqing for so long, knowing where there were persimmons to pick, naturally he was not greedy for them. That being the case, Wei Lanxiang didn't say anything else, stopped outside the house, and watched the two of them went to the mountain.There were some things on the cart, and there were Lugu\u2019s chickens and ducks in the cages. Dahui and the other dogs were exploring the way ahead, sniffing at the roots of the trunks, sometimes lifting their hind legs to pee as a mark.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As soon as Lu Gu lit the fire, Shen Xuanqing came in from the outside. He squatted in front of the stove and subconsciously looked up.After a slight pause, Shen Xuanqing said, \"I'll cook the pot, and you chop the vegetables.\"He looked more natural than Lu Gu, and it was not like he didn't help Lu Gu to light the fire before, but after yesterday, there was something different between the two of them. Yes, even Lu Gu noticed it.\"Yeah.\" Lu Gu nodded, got up and stepped aside, and went to the chopping board to chop the vegetables.The firewood crackled softly, and he buried his head to chop the vegetables, seemingly concentrating on it, but actually felt an inexplicable feeling in his heart, like joy or anxiety, he couldn't figure it out whether he was happy or unhappy, his delicate eyebrows frowned slightly, a little depressed, didn't know what's wrong with himself.Autumn leaves turned red and yellow, and the mountains and forests were dyed with beautiful colors, like clouds in the evening sky. In autumn, various fruits were gradually ripening, and the days on the mountains were busy. Too much thought to think about those.Withered and yellow leaves fell from the branches, Lu Gu walked to the small slope of the pine forest with a wooden stick, stepping on a layer of fallen leaves.A long-tailed tit fell on a tree not far away, and some of its feathers were blue. He saw it, but his eyes were focused on the ground. He came out to pick mushrooms today, and found many, he picked and put them in the bamboo basket on the back.He left the pup in the yard, and he couldn't take him with him everywhere. Now the pup was almost three months old. When he bought him outside, he had to grow up a bit so he wouldn't keep barking to people.In a few months, the pup would be half-grown, and he could take him with him when he went out, otherwise the mountain road was far away, and the taller grass would block the pup.At the foot of the pine tree, a nest of yellowish mushrooms was fat and big. There were several flowers. Lu Gu squatted down and brushed away the broken branches and weeds on it with his hands.There were many white mushrooms in the basket, they were white and full, and the mushrooms had a skirt that looked like a fishing net. It was the bamboo fungus he picked in the depths of the bamboo forest. The sticky black mushrooms head had been removed, he would dry and sell them in the town. They were also valuable and a rare treasure.When Lu Gu was young, he went to the mountain with his mother to collect mushrooms, and remembered a lot of edible ones. The appearance of bamboo mushroom was different from other mushrooms, so it was easier to distinguish. Just picked up the white ones and didn\u2019t pick the kind that can't be eaten.Before picking the bamboo basket, he took a look. There were bamboo mushrooms and other miscellaneous mushrooms. He had already picked up half the basket, which was quite a lot. He walked around for a long time, and he walked a little far. Today, Dahui and Shen Xuanqing\u00a0\u00a0went to hunt, so he went back alone.The mountain forest was dyed in autumn colors, and it was more beautiful than before. Lu Gu walked back with a wooden stick, and the bamboo basket on his back was lighter than usual, so he walked more briskly.The autumn wind was refreshing, and with the beautiful scenery in front of him, Lu Gu was in a good mood. On the way, he came across a mountain persimmon tree with fruits hanging on the branches, some of which were red. He tiptoed to pull down the branches and picked the ripe fruits.The wild persimmons in the mountains were eaten by birds, especially the ones on the top of the branches, which turn red early. When Lu Gu saw a few pecked ones at the bottom, he didn\u2019t pick them. He wondered how the birds knew the persimmons were ripe. Yes, maybe like the Dahui, they could smell it.Persimmons could be soaked in wine and vinegar. Before going up the mountain, he heard from Wei Lanxiang that he would make persimmon vinegar this year. Before he went down the mountain next time, he would pick more mountain persimmons and bring them back. You only needed to make some so you wouln't have so much to eat, and you had to save the sun-dried persimmons for winter.There were already mushrooms and persimmons. Lu Gu saw a beautiful mountain flower next to him, so he picked two, and played with it in his hands as he walked. Thinking of this, his brows and eyes were stained with a slight smile.He was busy picking in the mountains every day, and even Lu Gu didn't realize it. He hadn't thought of the fear when he first came to the mountains for a long time, and gradually got used to such days. In addition, you could find a little fun for yourself in your busy schedule.And when he saw Shen Xuanqing in the evening, he would feel more at ease. Sometimes Shen Xuanqing looked at him and smiled, and he would be happy in his heart, but he didn't know how to express it, so he lowered his head in embarrassment, and just said to Shen Xuanqing that the meal was ready, or he politely gave Shen Xuanqing a pile of the fruits he picked during the day to eat.As he was walking, he heard a mountain stream flowing, so Lu Gu went over to wash his hands, sat on a rock by the stream, and took a mountain persimmon from a bamboo basket.The ripe persimmons were soft. Gently peeled off the outer skin to reveal the sweet and soft flesh inside. There was a layer of slightly astringent skin outside the flesh, but it was quite delicious and not astringent.After tasting the soft and sweet persimmon fruit, Lu Gu felt relieved, picked up the bamboo basket again and walked back, picked a lot, and brought it to Shen Xuanqing when he came back, if he couldn't finish it, he could mix it into the noodles hen he made persimmon pancakes, the pancakes were sweet and delicious, otherwise it would be a pity if the persimmon fruits rotted.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Lu Gu looked into the forest, and soon saw Shen Xuanqing and Dahui.Shen Xuanqing seemed to drag something, Lu Gu remembered that he was still carrying a bamboo basket, and he didn't know if it would hard or not, so he simply went to pick it up.\"I caught a dwarf deer, and I shot it in the leg. I will raise it for a few days and take it down when we go back down the mountain.\" Seeing Lu Gu approaching, Shen Xuanqing was very happy. The dwarf deer had a cloth to wrap around its limp front leg, oozing the green medicine and red blood stains, he couldn't run anymore, he wrapped a hemp rope around his neck and pulled him all the way back.This dwarf deer had quite a temper, and sometimes it would stick its neck to fight against Shen Xuanqing, pulling the rope backwards and unwilling to go forward, but there was Dahui roaring fiercely at the side, making a gesture of attacking and biting it, the dwarf deer frightened, it finally moved forward. Shen Xuanqing was not used to it, and when it didn\u2019t want to walk again, he whipped the hemp rope like a whip a few times, so he didn't need Dahui to threaten it anymore.Now that it was autumn, the vegetation han\u2019t completely withered, and the wild fruits were ripe and luxuriant. During this period of time, most of the wild animals in the mountains were fattened up. There were more edible fruits and grasses, so they were naturally fatter.\"I'll carry it.\" Seeing that Shen Xuanqing had to drag the dwarf deer, Lu Gu knew that he couldn't control it. If the dwarf deer broke free, wouldn't it be a waste of work for today, it would be better for him to carry the bamboo basket.It was not far from the yard, and the bamboo basket wasn't too heavy, so Shen Xuanqing gave it to Lu Gu, saying: \"Dahui and the others caught two long-tailed pheasants, and they are all inside.\"The bamboo basket was big enough, but Lu Gu\u00a0was also able to carry it, and seeing Shen Xuanqing smiling all the time, he was also happy, and said: \"I picked some persimmons, they are all red, you can eat them when you peel them off.\"\"Okay, I'll eat one.\" Shen Xuanqing agreed, with a smile on his handsome face.And compared to the timid and cowardly one before, Lu Gu would gradually show a light smile, although not many times, but his brows and eyes were slightly curved, his eyes were bright and energetic, and he could tell that he was in a good mood just by looking at him.Once back, Shen Xuanqing drove a wooden stake to the corner of the backyard, nailed it deep into the ground, and tied the deer with a short hemp rope.The puppy was very curious about the dwarf deer, and he followed Shen Xuanqing to the backyard when he was working. The chickens and ducks were all in the fence, so he couldn't get in. When he wanted to bite the chickens and ducks, he was taught a lesson by Dahui\u2019s growl. Now that he had a little memory, he only opened his mouth to bite when he was excited to play, but with Lu Gu watching, he grabbed him away every time.\"Woof!\" The puppy leaned forward slightly, jumping and calling at the dwarf deer, as if he wanted to show off his abilities. Although the dwarf deer was shorter than the sika deer, but it was bigger than the puppy, especially this one was an adult deer.After Shen Xuanqing finished his work, he went to the front yard to wash his hands and eat. The puppy was still playing in the backyard, barking powerfully. Even if the owner was not there, he was not afraid of living creatures taller than him at all.The picked persimmons were placed on the window sill of the kitchen window, and they were lined up in a row. Lu Gu had already scooped the water for washing his hands. After Shen Xuanqing finished washing, he first handed over a soft red persimmon. He also said: \"I\u2019m still heating the steamed buns and rice porridge, you can eat this first, and then you can eat after that.\"\"Yeah.\" There was a smile in Shen Xuanqing's eyes. The persimmons picked by himself were not as sweet as the persimmons fulang brought back and handed to him. Lu Gu was washing the dishes in the kitchen. By now, the courtyard door should be locked, but Shen Xuanqing hesitated, and went into the kitchen to help Lu Gu to wash the dishes. He could put the clean bowl away.\"I want to hunt foxes these few days. It's cold, and fox fur can be sold at a high price. Shifu said that he has a network in Fucheng. If I can find good furs, the price will be higher than in the town.\"Lu Gu raised his head and listened to him carefully without interrupting.\"It's just that when I go out tomorrow, I guess it will take a day or two to come back. Foxes are cunning, quick-witted and hard to catch, and they often come out at night, so it's more troublesome to track them down. I'm going out tomorrow, so I probably won't come back at night.\"Lu Gu suddenly felt a little nervous, he was at a loss, but he couldn't hold Shen Xuanqing from hunting. After a moment of stupor, he asked, \"Then where do you sleep at night?\"Shen Xuanqing said, \"There's no need to worry about it. Take the dogs and find a place, bring thick clothes, one night is over.\"\"I'm not here at night, you have to remember to lock the door, so come and take a look how Iock it.\" Shen Xuanqing said and walked out, Lu Gu naturally followed.The thick tree trunk used to cover the courtyard gate was heavy, and it was specially strong wood. Otherwise, if a wild animal attacked the gate, it would be too light to hold it.\"When I open the door tomorrow, I will lean it to the left, and only open one door to go out. You can move it at night, and the door bolt can be held when you move it over.\" Shen Xuanqing didn't worry much about himself, but he was a little worried about Lu Gu who was alone, and he would bring all three big dogs with him tomorrow, leaving Lu Gu alone.\"Okay.\" Lu Gu nodded his head and made a note. He didn't need to hold the tree trunk from the wall, but it was still possible for him to hold it by moving it to the middle. It only took a little effort.It was agreed and there was no further objection, the two of them washed up and fell asleep.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 98": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Sweet Little FulangCH 50.2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayOn the bed, Shen Xuanqing didn't fall asleep for a while, turned over and hugged Lu Gu in his arms, and then felt satisfied and comfortable. When he couldn't talk back just now, he thought that Lu Gu would be frightened.Lu Gu's eyes were indeed a little flustered, but he didn't say anything, even after thinking about it, Lu Gu had never told him that he was afraid, and trembling with fear, he couldn\u2019t speak.\u00a0He thought about it, sighed slightly, hugged the person in his arms and gradually fell asleep.The next day, after Shen Xuanqing left, Lu Gu went back to the courtyard, closed the door and tried to move the tree trunk. It was really difficult, but he could move it, so he felt much more relieved.It was still early, and the dew outside was a bit heavy. He didn\u2019t let the chickens and ducks out. After sweeping the house and the sun came out, he moved the bamboo plaques out from the main room. The mushrooms and goji berries he picked yesterday were dried before they could be put up.The puppy who was sleeping on the sack woke up, no longer curled up into a ball of fluffy meat, he yawned, stood up and stretched, then shook his round and fat body and walked towards Lu Gu , barking and rubbing against Lu Gu's legs, it was time to eat.Lu Gu broke a steamed bun for him, and a few pieces of cooked rabbit meat. Dahui and the others like to eat the cooked ones. After the meat was cooked, the puppy also ate with them together. Lu Gu gave the remaining pieces to him, put it into the basin and poured water into the nearby dogbowl.The puppy put his head down and picked the meat to eat first. He could eat meat every two or three days, and he was really well-raised.\u00a0Seeing that he was eating fast, Lu Gu couldn't help touching his head. The puppy was taught not to be too protective of his food, so he allowed Lu Gu to touch him.When the sun was high, it was time to let the chickens and ducks out to graze. Lu Gu went to the backyard. The dwarf deer was still tied in a corner, lying on the ground. When people came, he raised his head vigilantly. Lu Gu saw that it was still alive. He didn\u2019t need to worry, as for the leg injury, Shen Xuanqing said it didn't matter, and he would change the medicine when he came back.After driving the chickens and ducks to the fence outside the yard, Lu Gu pulled a bundle of grass before going back.\u00a0Both the long-tailed pheasant in the woodshed and the dwarf deer in the backyard had to be fed. The long-tailed pheasant could fly by flapping its wings. Shen Xuanqing was worried, so he locked the pheasant in the woodshed.The pheasant was alright, Lu Gu thought that if he wanted to raise the dwarf deer, he had to feed it, otherwise it would be a pity for such a fat prey to be bred and sold. He still remembered the first time Shen Xuanqing took him to the town Although the dwarf deer was different from the sika deer, the young deer price was worth some money.He asked last night, and Shen Xuanqing said that the dwarf deer ate both grass and leaves. He pulled out different grasses and went back to see which kind of grass the dwarf deer like to eat, but the dwarf deer was wary, and it didn\u2019t move its mouth much in front of him, so he had to carry the basket to pick dipicai first.Lu Gu was picking dipicais around the courtyard. He didn't walk too far, and the courtyard door was still open. The puppy followed him all the time, running, dancing and having fun.After picking up a basket of dipicai, Lu Gu sat in the yard and cleaned it, washed it twice with water, and spread it on a bamboo plaque to dry when it was clean.After finishing all this, he didn't stop to work. He carried a bamboo basket and took a short hoe to dig the tianwogen (\u751c\u7a9d\u6839,\u00a0sweet root). At the bottom of the hill not far away, there were several clumps of tianwogen. The fibrous root was broken off and only the bottom large root was left.Because he was not far away, he didn't lock the door, and let the puppy follow him. He dug tianwogen and the puppy helped him to dig the soil when he saw it, but he was so excited that he splashed the soil all over Lu Gu.\"Okay, okay, I'll come, you dig here.\" Lu Gu said and carried him to the side to avoid trouble.The tianwogens here were quite big, almost as big as his fist. Lu Gu squatted on the ground, he dug out some tianwogens and put them into the bamboo basket.More than 20 tianwogens were dug out from these clumps, and Lu Gu didn't want the ones that were too small. He didn't stop until he had dug up all the ones here.He saw a lot of sour red fruits in the grass. People didn't eat them very much, but Shen Xuanqing said that the dwarf deer preferred them. The bamboo baskets were full with tianwogens with soil. The sour red fruits were too small, so he even cut off the branches, got a bunch of them back.After returning, he went to the backyard to have a look. The dwarf deer ate the grass, and the rest probably didn't like it very much. Now he knew what kind of grass to plant.Throwing the sour red fruit to the dwarf deer, Lu Gu didn't care about it, went to the front yard to wash three tianwogens, put a mixed-flour steamed bun in the pot, and lit the fire to steam it.Tianwogens were said to be sweet, but they didn\u2019t actually taste very sweet. They tasted delicious when they were steamed. Some people dipped them in honey to make them sweeter. The golden honey that Shen Xuanqing found before was still somewhat sweet.With Shen Xuanqing not around, Lu Gu didn't dare to eat too much. He opened the honey jar and looked at it, thinking that it would be good to take some and rub it on tianwogen.During the day, he was busy alone, digging things and taking care of the chickens and ducks. When the ducks swam, Lu Gu sat on the edge of the pond with bamboo strips in his arms and weaved bamboo plaques.Don't be too distracted if you want to do more delicate work.No one talked to him, he just thought about things by himself, there were not many bamboo strips, and when Shen Xuanqing was busy hunting foxes, he had to chop some bamboo back, the bamboo plaques were small, and it was convenient to dry the wolfberry and mushrooms, and poured them into the cloth bag directly after drying, but he still had to weave a big bamboo mat to dry a lot of wild vegetables.When he was busy, he didn't feel anything, but at night, the mountains and forests seemed extraordinarily quiet.After fixing the courtyard door, Lu Gu sat in the courtyard and waited for a long time, afraid that if he closed the door, Shen Xuanqing wouldn\u2019t be able to enter the door if he came back.The puppy stayed with him in the yard until the moon was in the middle of the sky. There was no sound of people or dogs barking outside. He looked up at the moon for a while before going back to his room to sleep.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 99": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Sweet Little FulangCH 51.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIn the early morning, the mountains were misty, and a wisp of cooking smoke wafted from the high-walled courtyard in the deep mountains . Lu Gu sat silently in front of the stove to boil water, looking a little tired.The puppy came in from the outside and rubbed his head against his calf. He stroked the puppy's furry head and pinched his soft ears. Then there was a smile on his face, and he said, \"Are you done eating?\" When the Dahui come back, if he catchs more rabbits, you will have meat to eat.\u201dLast night the big dogs were not there, and the puppy didn\u2019t want to sleep alone in the main room, so he barked at the door of his room and scratched the door with his paws. He had no choice but to open the door and bring in the sack, and let the puppy sleep under the bed.Besides, Lu Gu couldn't sleep alone. The mountains and forests were too quiet at night, and sometimes you could hear the screams of unknown night birds outside. Fortunately, the closed doors and windows were solid. The kind that was propped up outwards was much stronger than a lattice window pasted with paper if it was tightly closed.Sleeping at night without the tall man next to him, it seemed that something was missing, worry and fear were unavoidable, Lu Gu woke up from a dream, he woke up but couldn't remember what dream he had, only knew that his heart was terrified, and he couldn't bear it and he slept late at night.The light of the fire reflected on his face, driving away the coldness of the early morning. After the steamed buns were warmed up, Lu Gu sat on the small stool in front of the stove to eat and drink. It was cold, and the fire at the bottom of the stove gradually went out but there was still some heat. There were still a lot of watercress, he picked up a few and ate them.He was sitting and eating, and although the puppy had eaten, he still stood up, resting his fat front paws on his lap, wanting to smell the watercress in his hand.\"So greedy.\" Lu Gu said, he pinched a small piece of sour watercress for the puppy to smell. Sure enough, the puppy turned his head after smelling it a few times, and didn't want to eat it. Lu Gu threw it into the bottom of the stove after he smelling it, and elbowed the puppy's paw off his leg.Shen Xuanqing didn't know if he would come back today, Lu Gu thought so, he didn't delay after eating, and went to work as usual.He waited for the sun to come out to dry things every day, otherwise the fog and dew were still heavy when he woke up early, and the mushrooms and goji berries that were about to be dried, if they were taken out too early they would become damp again.Shen Xuanqing said that the dwarf deer also liked to eat mushrooms, but these mushrooms were picked up by Lu Gu from many places, and they were good things for people. He wouldn\u2019t be willing to give them to the dwarf deer, and they had to be dried and kept for stewing soup and vegetables in winter.The thick trunk at the door was heavy, so he moved it to the left door panel with all his strength, took the sickle and went out to mow the grass, and brought back a large bundle of grass to feed the dwarf deer and pheasants.Patting some grass and dirt on his body, Lu Gu and the dog let the chickens and ducks out again. The dog ran back and forth, barking at the chickens and ducks from time to time, learning how Lu Gu drove the chickens and ducks, and locked the chickens in a large cage to let them look for food by themself in the fence, then Lu Gu led the ducks to the pond.The pond was quite big, and every day the ducks were released, he need to ensure not to let them swim to the river. Even the puppy learned to stand by the narrow ditch leading to the river, barking loudly and threatening the ducks to swim back.The ditch was relatively narrow, and as soon as the ducks swim here, they could meet the dog standing next to it, and when the dog barked, they would hurriedly paddle their palmate feets and swim back.Today, as soon as the ducks entered the water, the puppy ran to the ditch and squatted, his back looked very reliable.Lu Gu saw that he was so smart, the puppy could take care of the ducks without Dahui around. He really liked him, so he walked over to pet the puppy who wagging his tail, and said with a slight smile, \"Guaizi, you are so good. Then you stay here and watch them, I'll go back and fetch water from the wooden barrel.\"Seeing him leaving, Guaizi subconsciously wanted to follow him, but when he turned his head, he saw the ducks were still in the pond, and he stood guard again.Lu Gu ran back and forth five times, fetching water from a clean place upstream, filling up the water tank, his body warmed up as soon as he moved, and it wasn't so cold anymore. He went to the river again with the fish basket to see the net he had set the day before yesterday. He often watched Shen Xuanqing set the net, and he would try it sometimes, as long as he was diligent, he could learn everything by doing it.The dense net he set caught some fishes and shrimps. Fortunately, he came to see it now, and there was a big fish flopping inside. Seeing that the fishing net was about to be broken, he quickly squatted by the river to pick them. The pond was not far away, and the puppy also ran over.He didn't want any fishes or shrimps that were too small, so he threw them into the river again, and pick the big fish out of the net. Out of the water, the big fish slapped its tail on the ground, and the water on its body splashed the puppy that get too close together.\"Wow, woof!\" The puppy was so easy to provoke, it immediately barked loudly at the fish, he tried to hold down the big fish with his paws and bite it, but the big fish hadn't exhausted yet, and was thrashing so hard that he failed for a while.With a smile on his face, Lu Gu also tried to catch the big fish. This fish was so powerful that he could feel the strength of the fish tail hitting the ground when he stretched out his hand. It was not easy to caught, so he first caught five small miscellaneous fish. He put them into the fish basket with the river shrimps, looked at the fishing net again, and he had to mend it later.Turning his head to look at the ducks, fortunately, they didn't swim into the river, but Lu Gu still walked over, picked up the long bamboo pole that had been placed by the pond and hit the water surface, driving them into the pond.The big fish had no strength to toss, so Lu Gu put it into the fish basket before the puppy bit, otherwise people wouldn't be able to eat it.Shen Xuanqing was not here, he couldn't finish the big fish by himself, besides, there were small fish and river prawns, when Shen Xuanqing came back he would make fish soup and stir-fried shrimps, he would eat very well, this big fish, he might as well killed and dried it in the sun, and kept it for winter.In this case, Lu Gu went back to get the knife and scissors. The puppy was smart, and saw that no one was looking after the ducks after he left, so he went back to squat by the ditch, and looked back at the fish basket, as if he was afraid that someone would steal it.Lu Gu was very proficient at killing fish, he scraped the scales of the big fish and small fishes, and threw the viscera into the pond for the ducks to eat.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 100": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Sweet Little FulangCH 51.2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayRemembering that he hadn\u2019t dug loach recently, the sun was hot now, and it wasn\u2019t cold in the water, so he took off his shoes and socks and went to the river to dig the mud to find the loach. The loach would have to be raised for two days to spit out the sand, so it wouldn\u2019t be too late,\u00a0\u00a0Shen Xuanqing would definitely come back tomorrow, just in time to eat.The fish soup was made with miscellaneous fishes, and the stewed loach would be a little too much, so he\u00a0\u00a0cut the loach into long pieces and fried it, added some dried chili and pepper, and fried it with a little more oil to make it spicy.There was a lot of work to be done, while Lu Gu was digging the mud, he was thinking that it was time to pick goji berries tomorrow. Once he got busy, he forgot the loneliness of being alone, and there were puppy barking from time to time, and the ducks quacking. It was still lively .In the middle of the afternoon, he drove the ducks out of the pond, put them in the fence with the chickens to let them eat grass, he cut the grass and carried it to the backyard for the dwarf deer to eat, and found sour red berries and other things outside.The pair of wild rabbits that Shen Xuanqing caught alive before were still alive, and they were brought home when the autumn harvest. Because the mother rabbit was pregnant, she didn't bring the cubs, so Shen Yan raised them. When she made a litter of rabbit cubs, the cubs could be raised to sell.The sun moved to the west, and before evening came, Lu Gu drove the chickens and ducks back to the backyard. Before cooking, he looked at the door for a while, although his eyes were full of disappointment, he still went back to cook and work.After eating alone, he also fed the puppy. It was still bright, so he took a needle and thread and sat in the yard to embroider a sachet.When the afterglow of the setting sun fell, he thought that Shen Xuanqing wouldn\u2019t come back, and thought that he would lock the gate of the courtyard after the flower was embroidered, but before the flower was embroidered, he heard a dog barking in the distance, and the puppy barked, Lu Gu couldn't care about anything else, put down the things at hand and ran out in a hurry.Shen Xuanqing came back, carrying two pieces of red fox fur with a long fork on his shoulders. There were quite a lot of equipment used in hunting, such as bow, arrow and slingshot, as well as spear and long fork, hatchet and machete. When he went out to spend the night in the deep mountains, apart from the long-fork, he brought a hatchet, machete, and several knives of different sizes.He also carried a bow and arrow, but it was useless, because the arrows would damage the fur. When hunting the foxes, most hunters used slingshots\u00a0\u00a0with clay projectiles to hit. It was best to stun them, but it depended on the hunter's eyesight, ability, and quick response.Skinning was a bloody job, and it was not easy for Lu Gu to see it, so as soon as the fox was caught, Shen Xuanqing peeled off the fox's fur and only brought back the fur.\"You're back.\" Lu Gu ran forward, excited by the joy and didn't know what to say for a moment.\"Well, I'm back.\" Shen Xuanqing said with a smile. Seeing that Lu Gu was in a hurry to help him carry the bamboo basket, he handed over the long fork. This one was light, but there were all kinds of things in the bamboo basket.Lu Gu walked beside him and looked at him, he said: \"This is fox fur.\"Shen Xuanqing was very happy to hear his fulang\u2019s voice, and said, \"Yes, this is. If I can caught more this year, I will give you a few pieces of fox fur to make a quilt, cover with it and be warm at\u00a0night in winter.\"Hunting foxes was not an easy task, otherwise the fox fur wouldn\u2019t be sold at a high price. Shen Xuanqing wanted to leave some furs for Lu Gu, as the further back the mountains, the colder it would be at night, there was a fox fur quilt that was light and warm.And his mother didn't even wear fox fur yet, so it wass not good to be so obviously partial to Lu Gu, if it was made into a fox fur quilt, it wouldn\u2019t be as conspicuous as fox fur.Besides, if you made fox fur quilts, it didn\u2019t matter if the color of the fox fur was not good. Killed a few more stupid mixed-haired foxes and made fox fur quilts for his mother. Older people didn\u2019t have a good winter like they did when they were young. .Lu Gu wanted to say that he didn't need it, it would be very warm with a cotton quilt, and it was more important to sell it for money, but he didn't know how to refuse, Shen Xuanqing was so happy, he didn't dare to go against his kindness, he nodded in agreement, he was thinking about what to say when the time came.Back in the yard, Lu Gu was about to cook, put down the long fork and said: \"Today, there are fishes and shrimps in the net. It takes a lot of time to stew the fish. I'll fry river shrimps for you, and rice wine.\"\"Okay, you can do whatever you want.\" Shen Xuanqing unloaded the bamboo basket, and his handsome face was full of smiles.Lu Gu was cooking in the kitchen, and listening to Shen Xuanqing's movements outside made him felt more at ease. The movement of the big dogs and puppy playing and fighting made the courtyard lively, and made him felt at ease and no longer afraid.After a hot meal, his fulang sat beside him, and Shen Xuanqing was so satisfied.Because he spent the night outside, his body was unavoidably dirty, and after running in the mountains for two days, sweating was unavoidable. After eating and resting for a while, he said he wanted to take a bath, and Lu Gu went to the kitchen to boil a large pot of water for him. Shen Xuanqing moved the bathtub into the kitchen, adding a big firewood to the bottom of the pot later to make it warmer.It was already dark, there was a lot of water boiled, Lu Gu also took a bath, he washed first, now it was Shen Xuanqing's turn, he went into the room and made the bed in the dark, reluctant to light the lamp and lay down, besides, there was nothing to do at night.After Shen Xuanqing dried his hair with the fire in front of the stove, he also went to bed in the dark after entering the room.Lu Gu hadn't slept yet, and he really felt at ease after lying next to someone. Shen Xuanqing came to hug him without saying a word, closing his eyes and going to sleep.\u00a0Unexpectedly, Shen Xuanqing couldn't sleep, and gradually became restless.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
