Though she had made mental preparations, she still couldn\u2019t help but be amazed by the cold and fierce man pressing down on her. In the next moment, she felt his shaft thrust deep inside her, and she moaned.\u2018Ooh\u2026 haa\u2026 Hey, System, according to the plot, the male lead was drugged by me, right?\u2019System: \u2026The System didn\u2019t answer, and Ruan Jiaojiao didn\u2019t care either. She answered the question herself.\u2018But in the plot, the female lead found him, and that\u2019s how their first papapa happened. Tsk\u2026 how come she got to reap the benefits when I was the one who drugged him? And she even acted like she got taken advantage of. What an ungrateful woman\u2026\u2019 Ruan Jiaojiao moaned as she let her mind drift.The System thought: You think everyone is like you? The female lead is a pure white flower, okay? A man is forcing himself on you, yet you\u2019re just happily lying there and moaning while chatting with me! Who does that?However, as much as the System was complaining, it still had to do its job.System: You already know the plot. Since this is your first mission, I lent you a hand. But you\u2019ll need to rely on your own abilities after this world.Ruan Jiaojiao understood the System\u2019s meaning. After responding with a short \u2018OK,\u2019 she finally turned her attention to the male lead of the story, Huo Yuting.She stared at his handsome face for a while. As expected of a Mary Sue novel; the male lead was a great beauty! However, Ruan Jiaojiao was more interested in something else.And that was\u2026 she moved her lecherous gaze from his attractive face down his tanned body, past his defined V-line and powerful eight-pack abs. Her fingers gently slid down his body until they reached his taut buttocks, then she gave them a squeeze.System: \u2026President Huo: \u2026Huo Yuting glared at the brainless woman lying under him. Though she was bolder than he expected, he had already decided how he should kill her afterward.Meanwhile, Ruan Jiaojiao paid no attention to what the male lead was thinking. At this point, she didn\u2019t even bother to think about the plot. So what if she failed her mission? This was her first one anyway.\u2018This godd*mn System thinks it\u2019s so smart.\u2019She didn\u2019t even get to experience the pain of having her clothes ripped off and her body forcefully penetrated. The moment she opened her eyes, she was already pressed under the male lead and in the middle of doing this mechanical pistoning exercise!\u2018Seriously\u2026 what a disappointment!\u2019System: \u2026System: Hey! I can hear your thoughts, you know?!Ruan Jiaojiao smiled slightly.\u2018I wanted you to hear it!\u2019Since the man was looming above her, her expression was in plain sight to him. She seemed a little distracted.This delivered a heavy blow to Huo Yuting\u2019s male ego.Did this woman know that it was his first time?! Compared to the other gold masters she\u2019d slept with, was he a disappointment?! Was she secretly ridiculing at him for being a virgin?Provoked by this thought, Huo Yuting\u2019s original intention of quickly venting and leaving flew out the window. He was going to teach this woman a lesson!With that, he gripped her ankles and pulled her legs to rest on his shoulders.

    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2 \u2013 Seven Times a Night My Ass! (H)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayRuan Jiaojiao didn\u2019t know why Huo Yuting\u2019s beast was suddenly unleashed, but she didn\u2019t really care. At the moment, the man\u2019s thickness was aggressively stirring up her insides, making her entire body tremble in pleasure. Her plump bosoms bounced up and down with his movements. Ruan Jiaojiao knew that her current body belonged to a beautiful and voluptuous female actress. Though the female lead\u2019s appearance was pure and sweet, she lacked the type of charm and allure that a mature woman possessed. The pure little female lead was pampered and doted on by every male character in the story. However, men were all the same in bed; even the most well-dressed ones would turn into starving wolves when their clothes were off. The female lead had been papa \u2019d so intensely by the male lead that she couldn\u2019t get out of bed the next morning. Huo Yuting raised his body and continued pounding into Ruan Jiaojiao, his balls slapping repeatedly against her an*s. From their current position, Ruan Jiaojiao could admire not only the male lead\u2019s body but also her own slender waist, long legs, and large chest. Thinking about how miserably the owner of this gorgeous body had died in the original story, Ruan Jiaojiao really felt bad for her. It was the fate of a supporting role, born without the female lead halo. However, thanks to the intervention of the System, Ruan Jiaojiao was able to change her role. She was no longer a random cannon fodder, but the woman who took the male lead\u2019s first time! That\u2019s right. The original host wasn\u2019t even a villainess. She was just an actress who wanted to obtain a rich and handsome gold master, nothing more. The reason she chose the male lead as her target was simple. After years of hard work, the original host barely managed to become a C-list actress. However, at an earlier point in the storyline, just before Ruan Jiaojiao took over her body, she found herself being plagued by countless rumors and scandals. Because she looked like a fox, she was accused of being kept by a gold master. The media\u2019s only evidence was a few everyday pictures of her that looked \u201cambiguous.\u201d To them, her face was the best evidence. \u2018This goddamn superficial society!\u2019 Ruan Jiaojiao lamented. At first, the original host didn\u2019t want a gold master. They were usually fat and ugly, and she just couldn\u2019t bring herself to do it. But eventually, she was left with no other choice. In the entertainment circle, there was no shortage of fresh faces and talents. Someone like her, who remained unpopular despite being in the circle for so long, was useless. Therefore, her company didn\u2019t bother to spend money on her. The original host was stuck in a mess of negative comments and black stains. She felt incredibly bitter and unjust, so she finally decided to find a gold master. She thought that since she was going to do it, she might as well aim for the best! Thus, she drugged the male lead. Of course, the emotional details of this backstory were all filled in by Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s imagination. After all, the original host was barely mentioned in the novel. When the sexually satiated male lead discovered that she was the one who had drugged him, he\u2019d casually waved his hand and sent some men to deal with her. The original host\u2019s reputation became so poor that only third-rate film productions bothered to approach her. However, her contract with her agency was still ongoing. Faced with an overwhelming amount of liquidated damages, she had no choice but to grit her teeth and enter the AV (adult video) industry. She became depressed and ultimately chose to kill herself by overdosing on pills. Unto death, the C-list actress who was rumored to be a slutty fox was actually still a virgin. Ahem. The last part was made up and added by Ruan Jiaojiao. Truthfully, Ruan Jiaojiao believed that the original host was more unlucky than pitiful. If she hadn\u2019t picked the male lead as her target, maybe she wouldn\u2019t have met with such a miserable end. After all, the male lead could only belong to the female lead. When her train of thought got to this point, Ruan Jiaojiao looked at Hu Yuting with enthusiasm. \u2018Ohoho\u2026 Doesn\u2019t that mean I\u2019m using the female lead\u2019s man right now? How exciting!\u2019 Huo Yuting felt both disdain and resentment when he saw the look in her eyes. Instead of surrendering to his relentless thrusting, she was filled with enthusiasm. As expected of a loose woman! However, he had to admit that her body was delicious. As he thought this, Huo Yuting slid out and rammed back in. Her warm and wet insides licked and sucked on his hard shaft, sending shivers of pleasure up his spine. When his gaze fell on her chest, his heart began to pound faster. Reaching out, he placed his hands on her mounds and kneaded them. A numbing sensation suddenly traveled through Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s sensitive body. She let out a shuddering moan as her walls abruptly tightened around his member. At the same time, he shot out. Huo Yuting\u2019s expression immediately stiffened and turned dark. Ruan Jiaojiao felt his member softened inside her as scalding heat flooded her walls. She looked at him suspiciously. Did he just come? She curled her lip. Barely any time had passed since she opened her eyes and felt him thrust into her body, you know?! They had just started! The unconcealed look of disdain on Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s face enraged Huo Yuting. How dare this woman look down on him? Does she want to die, die, or die?!! His limp member slid out of her walls. Ruan Jiaojiao looked at it with some regret. The male lead\u2019s legendary \u201cweapon\u201d was big indeed; unfortunately, its \u201clifespan\u201d was short. Huo Yuting tried to resist the urge to beat this woman! He doesn\u2019t hit women!! He is a gentleman!! Why is she looking at him like that?! What is that look supposed to mean?? Not only disdain but even\u2026 As though he were a bullied little wife, Huo Yuting pulled a blanket over from the end of the bed and wrapped it around his body. Meanwhile, Ruan Jiaojiao was sporting a relaxed I-wish-I-had-a-cigarette expression on her face. She had anticipated a fierce battle and never thought it would end with her waist still intact and her energy level still full. Goddammit! How could he finish prematurely right as she was getting hot and excited?! According to legends, wasn\u2019t the male lead supposed to be able to go seven times a night? Huo Yuting saw the woman\u2019s originally contemptuous gaze suddenly light up. It was directed at his blanket\u2026 or more accurately, at his crotch area. \u201cHey\u2026\u201d As soon as she opened her mouth, she noticed the terrifying storm brewing in Huo Yuting\u2019s eyes. She swallowed the rest of her words, feeling that he would strangle her if she continued. The atmosphere turned awkward. Huo Yuting wasn\u2019t sure why he hadn\u2019t left yet. His original plan was to dispose of the woman as soon as he finished using her, but\u2026 he felt that if he left now, he would lose too much face. And feel a little\u2026 Unhappy? The male lead\u2019s mood was complicated. Ruan Jiaojiao yawned in boredom. She paid no attention to what the male lead was thinking and doing. There were only two options left for them anyway: either he leaves, or they continue. Therefore, under the man\u2019s unblinking stare, she calmly got out of the bed without covering her bare body and walked into the bathroom. As she moved, a turbid white liquid trickled down her inner thighs. Soon, the silent hotel room was filled with the muffled sound of running water from the bathroom. Huo Yuting\u2019s body started to heat up again. As he listened to the sound of the water, he could imagine the woman\u2019s sexy, voluptuous body standing under the showerhead. He had to admit that she was an exceedingly beautiful and alluring woman. Unfortunately, she was also stupid and devious for intentionally drugging him and climbing into his bed. It wasn\u2019t his first time encountering a woman like her, but he never thought he would actually slip up and lose his virginity to one. She even ridiculed him! While she was inside the bathroom, Ruan Jiaojiao heard the sound of a door closing. When she finished and walked out wearing a bathrobe, the hotel room was empty. The male lead had left. Was she going to worry about her fate as a cannon fodder? Of course not. She didn\u2019t care. Not one bit. Ruan Jiaojiao laid on the messy bed and closed her eyes. Soon, she was asleep.T/N: OOF. And am I the only one who found HYT kind of cute here?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3 \u2013 A Fresh Pretty BoyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAlmost one month after Ruan Jiaojiao rolled in the sheets with the man who finished prematurely\u2026Despite being aware that her reputation was bad, Ruan Jiaojiao didn\u2019t try to do anything about it. Since she was only an unknown C-list actress, the rumors weren\u2019t that bad anyway. She focused on doing whatever she wanted to do and felt completely at ease as she went about her filming.Her role was a minor supporting role with very few scenes. She had plenty of free time on her hands, so she decided to secretly observe and rate the looks of the other actors on set.After all, she was also a member of the superficial society!Soon, she became engrossed in observing.It was a large-scale ancient drama. The costumes and props were extremely beautiful and intricate, and the actors were either professionals or inexperienced students.The male lead and second male lead represented two types of aesthetics.One was the cold and seasoned Film Emperor, the other was a fresh pretty boy.Even the System couldn\u2019t help asking Ruan Jiaojiao, \u201cWhich one do you like more?\u201dPersonally, it thought that the Film Emperor was more suitable for a mature woman like her. Moreover, he was also the novel\u2019s second male lead.\u201cThis old lady likes the ones that are so fresh they can\u2019t be fresher,\u201d she replied.The System was rendered speechless.\u2018Well, a mature beauty paired with a puppy-like man seems interesting too.\u2019The System absolutely refused to admit that it had been corrupted by its host.Just as Ruan Jiaojiao was enjoying herself by staring at the handsome men in the crew, almost forgetting about the novel\u2019s male lead and female lead, the male lead finally launched an attack on her.This time, it wasn\u2019t a gossip magazine or a street tabloid. It was the most influential media company in the entertainment circle. The article talked about the dark side of the entertainment industry, using Ruan Jiaojiao as the primary example.It was not an insinuation but a public execution.The wording in the article was so sharp and righteous that it would make anyone who read it want to chase Ruan Jiaojiao out of the entertainment circle.The phone in her hand suddenly rang with a call from her agent. As soon as she accepted the call, she heard her agent ask, \u201cRuan Jiaojiao, did you offend someone?\u201d\u201cYeah. An important man wanted me to sleep with him. I rejected him, so now he\u2019s retaliating.\u201dRuan Jiaojiao lied without a change in her expression.Just then, Shen Muyan, a handsome young man who was sitting in the same dressing room, looked up at her. Ruan Jiaojiao threw him a wink. When she saw his pale cheeks turn red, she grinned in satisfaction.Her efforts throughout the past few days of filming were not in vain. She\u2019d sent him many ambiguous looks and was just waiting for an opportunity to charge forward and jump him now.Shen Muyan also played a role in this Mary Sue novel. He was a sheltered young master of a rich family, pure and well-protected from many things in the world. After getting scouted on the streets, he signed up to join the entertainment circle in a moment of curiosity.His family spoiled him and treated it as a momentary interest, so they let him do whatever he wanted. They were rich enough to afford it, anyway.Later on, Shen Muyan shot an idol drama with the female lead and fell in love with her. He was infatuated and often helped her out in secret, but the female lead only saw him as a good friend.At this point in the storyline, the youth had yet to meet the female lead.\u2018If I don\u2019t make a move now, it\u2019ll be too late,\u2019 Ruan Jiaojiao thought.With that being said, she wasn\u2019t intentionally trying to rob the female lead of her men. If she was, she would have aimed for Qin Rui, the Film Emperor, instead of Shen Muyan.After she ended the call with her agent, Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s mood was completely unaffected. She was thick-skinned enough to be able to ignore the ugly things people were saying about her online.At the moment, she and Shen Muyan were the only people in the dressing room.In fact, she had purposely entered this room to answer the call because she knew that Shen Muyan would be here. He liked to play games in the dressing room during his breaks.Ruan Jiaojiao put away her phone and walked toward Shen Muyan. He was sitting on a couch and appeared somewhat unnatural and shy as he watched her approach.The System looked at the scene in excitement.Ahhh, his perverted host was going to extend her evil claws to the innocent youth!Under Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s influence, the System had evidently transformed into a System whose \u201cmind\u201d was filled with indecent thoughts. It was undeniably corrupted!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

(HH)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cYou heard everything?\u201d Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s voice was seductive with just the right touch of huskiness. She looked like a fox spirit from ancient folklore, ready to seduce an innocent scholar.Shen Muyan made a sound of agreement.Ruan Jiaojiao sat down on the couch and kicked off her high heels, then she plopped her head on his lap and asked, \u201cI don\u2019t want to go out. Can you stay with me for a while?\u201dHe made another sound of agreement. His body had frozen up, while his face and ears were burning with embarrassment.Ruan Jiaojiao turned her face to the side, but due to the positioning of her body, the movement brought her bright red lips right to his crotch.Wah!This technique!!The System was on the edge of its seat!Shen Muyan\u2019s body became even stiffer as his member started to strain against the fabric of his jeans. The embarrassment he felt made him wanted to dig a hole and hide.&amp;nbsp;The woman on his lap laughed and gave the bulge a little kiss before sitting up, her eyes twinkling with amusement. She placed her palms against the wall behind the couch, effectively trapping him between her arms.What she did next almost made him jump off the couch.\u201cY-You\u2026\u201d he began to stutter nervously.It was his first time encountering such a bold woman. Though he knew he was good-looking and had been confessed to many times by countless girls, the most those girls had done was confess to him in person.Yet this woman didn\u2019t even say she liked him, she just\u2026 just\u2026The hand Ruan Jiaojiao had placed on his bulge moved, squeezing it lightly.\u201cYou\u2019re hard,\u201d she pointed out calmly.With a poomf , Shen Muyan\u2019s face turned into a tomato.Ruan Jiaojiao took his hand and guided it to the area between her thighs. She extended one of his fingers and placed it right on her damp panty-clad entrance.\u201cI\u2019m wet.\u201dShe moved her face closer and whispered in his ear.\u201cWanna do it? I won\u2019t ask you to take responsibility afterward~\u201dShen Muyan\u2019s eyes widened.\u2018S-She\u2026\u2019Before he could think of a response, Ruan Jiaojiao had already parted her legs and straddled his waist. She wrapped her arms around his neck and gently licked his ear.\u201cMuyan, I have condoms with me. I don\u2019t have a gold master. I don\u2019t like other men, I like your type the best.\u201dClear and concise.After saying that, she pulled a condom out of her bag and tore open the wrapper with her teeth. Holding the rubber between two fingers, she turned around and looked at him.Shen Muyan knew he should push this woman away. He knew he should reject her.But despite knowing that, he remained stiff and motionless, as though someone had immobilized him by hitting an acupoint. He could only watch as the woman unzipped his pants and freed his stiff member from the confines of his boxers.She was about to take away his first time. Knowing this, a satisfied expression spread across Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s face. She placed the condom on the tip of his member and swiftly sheathed his energetic little Muyan.Under Shen Muyan\u2019s gaze, she took off her dress and pulled down her white lace panties. Her soft buttocks brushed against the head of his erect member as she positioned herself, causing him to shudder.\u201cHere I come!\u201d she said, licking her lips.Her eyes seemed to suck him in, trapping him in a bewitching spell. He couldn\u2019t move his eyes away from her, and his mind was a complete blank.Ruan Jiaojiao slowly lowered her body. As his hot member slid inside and rubbed against her walls, she couldn\u2019t help but moan.Earlier, she had measured his bulge with her eyes and knew his size was impressive, especially for a man with a pretty face like his. Alas, in the story, it was never used. Because of his unrequited love for the female lead, he kept himself clean and remained a virgin till the end.\u2018But now, his virginity is mine. So happy!\u2019Ruan Jiaojiao gently rocked her hips as she continued to sink down on his huge member. Their current position allowed her to take him all the way to the hilt.\u2018So big, so thick, so good\u2026\u201dWhen his entire length was finally inside her, she hummed in satisfaction. The original host\u2019s body was not only beautiful but also extremely sensitive, so the amount of pleasure she was feeling already was almost overwhelming.\u201cMuyan\u2026 Muyan\u2026 haaah\u2026 I like you the most, you make me feel so good\u2026\u201d she moaned as she started to bounce up and down on his member.Shen Muyan felt like he was going crazy. Her tight walls felt so good wrapped around him that he couldn\u2019t even think straight, let alone question the authenticity of her words.The two had worked in the same crew for a long time without exchanging more than a handful of words. Moreover, his agent had quietly told him many bad things about Ruan Jiaojiao. There was always disdain in her voice when she talked about her.But the current Shen Muyan thought that his agent must\u2019ve been jealous of Ruan Jiaojiao. Ruan Jiaojiao was clearly so beautiful and good. Those people didn\u2019t know her at all!At this moment, Young Master Shen was completely addicted to the new sensations he was feeling.As he slid in and out of her hot body, it didn\u2019t take long for him to come, but he became hard again in no time at all. Ruan Jiaojiao pulled a string of condoms out of her bag and impatiently took him inside her again.They stayed in the dressing room for a long time, but little Muyan remained energetic and refused to go down. Ruan Jiaojiao had to praise her own good vision. Sure enough, the young man\u2019s stamina was top-notch.Shen Muyan eventually turned the tables, pressing her against the full-length mirror on the wall as he thrust into her from behind.\u201cMore,\u201d Ruan Jiaojiao gasped, her heavy pants fogging up the glass in front of her.\u00a0 Shen Muyan grunted in response. He gripped the backs of her knees and lifted both of her legs, fully exposing the place they were connected to the mirror. Half of his thick member was stuffed inside her swollen entrance, and the other half was glistening with her juices.He pulled out until only the head was inside, then he slammed her down on his shaft. After repeating this a few times, Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s walls began to twitch and spasm. The tightness was both heavenly and unbearable at the same time, causing Shen Muyan to release again inside the condom.However, he wasn\u2019t done. The two explored numerous positions around the dressing room. Ruan Jiaojiao laid on the dressing table as Shen Muyan held her waist and pounded her body, over and over again. She moaned into the seat of the couch as he entered her from behind. Her legs felt like jelly around his waist as the head of his member rubbed and grinded against her sweet spot.By the time they were finished, the set was already empty, and the sky was dark. Ruan Jiaojiao felt as though she had turned into a puddle of water.Shen Muyan checked his phone and saw a weak message from his assistant.It seemed that the assistant had stopped by the dressing room and heard what he was doing inside. Naturally, he didn\u2019t dare disturb him. The thoughtful assistant had even helped him ask the director for a leave.Shen Muyan looked up at the woman standing beside him. She was in the middle of dressing. His eyes softened, and he quickly walked behind her to help her zip up her dress. His gaze was fixed on her pale, exposed back.When he was thrusting into her from behind earlier, he had been fascinated by her smooth back, her beautiful shoulder blades, and her soft skin. The thought of it made his blood boil, and he wanted to be inside her again.Ruan Jiaojiao turned and looked up at Shen Muyan\u2019s pretty face.\u201cGood boy\u2026\u201d She smiled, appreciating his considerate gesture.She couldn\u2019t help but reach up and pinch his cheek.Her words made his eyes flash with a touch of discontent.What did she mean by that? Was she still treating him like a child?Shen Muyan\u2019s eyes flared with indignation. He reached behind her and pulled the zipper down again. Ruan Jiaojiao was momentarily stunned as the silk fabric of her dress slid down her body.The \u201cgood boy\u201d lifted his leg and forced her legs apart just enough for his shaft to slide inside her. He pulled down her white lace bra without unclasping it from the back, and her perky mounds happily jumped out.He lowered his head and wrapped an arm around her waist. As he thrust upwards into her body, his pink tongue teased and licked at her erect nipples.The young man\u2019s actions filled with lust and desire, yet his eyes were still clear and innocent. He really made it hard for her to keep her legs closed!Ruan Jiaojiao smiled. Though her legs were soft and her waist was sore, the little fresh meat in front of her was too delicious.Her little puppy had suddenly turned into a baby wolf. What should she do? Grit her teeth and meet him head-on, of course!T/N: MVP of this chapter is the assistant ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Her expression was speechless as she turned to the System.\u201cSo what if the female lead has appeared? Why you so excited?\u201dThe System hehe\u2019d without responding.A minute later, when Ruan Jiaojiao saw the man who appeared on the set, she immediately understood the meaning behind the System\u2019s evil laughter.Although she had been the one to take the male lead\u2019s virginity this time, it was naturally not enough to stop the progression of the plotline. The female lead still possessed her halo, so she had already encountered and became familiar with the male lead some other way.Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s body was still sore after rolling in the sheets with Shen Muyan yesterday, and the fatigue showed on her face.Who would\u2019ve expected a side character\u2019s physical strength and stamina to be so much better than the male lead\u2019s, what the heck?!She licked her lips at the memory, her eyes glinting wickedly.Huo Yuting swept his gaze over her as though she was just an ordinary crew member. He noted her \u201cdejected\u201d and \u201chaggard\u201d expression and thought back to his retaliation.But\u2026 it wasn\u2019t enough.He had been feeling somewhat uncomfortable and unhappy since that night.The woman didn\u2019t look for him again. Even after he passed down her punishment, she did not appear to beg him for mercy. Though he had no plans of letting her off, either way, he still felt odd.\u201cBrother Huo\u2026\u201dA sweet, soft voice pulled his attention back. Huo Yuting\u2019s gaze softened unconsciously as he looked down.The girl standing beside him, Liu Luoxue, seemed to have fate with him. They\u2019d already bumped into each other several times by coincidence. At first, he had believed she was yet another golddigger who wanted to use him to get rich, but after a while, he realized she was different.Liu Xuoxue was pure and kind. Every beautiful adjective in the world could be applied to her. Though her appearance was not outrageously beautiful, her temperament could easily melt a man\u2019s heart.When her gaze met his, her pretty face turned red, and she shyly looked down.Ruan Jiaojiao looked at the ambiguous interaction between the two main leads and yawned. She looked at her nails and saw that they were chipped from yesterday\u2019s vigorous exercise. She would need to visit a salon later.The System watched as its host ignored the main leads and walked into a dressing room.\u2018Hey, hey! Why aren\u2019t you doing anything?\u2019Ruan Jiaojiao ignored it. She just wanted to find somewhere to lie down and sleep; if it weren\u2019t for the fact that she needed to shoot a few scenes today, she wouldn\u2019t have come to the set at all.The System was already used to this. In any case, it didn\u2019t have the power to control its host.Ruan Jiaojiao suddenly paused.\u201cSpeaking of, what is my mission again?\u201dSystem: Great ancestor, how could you forget your own mission? What are you even here for?!!\u201cTo sleep with handsome men, of course!\u201dMales were already rare enough in her previous world, let alone handsome males. She had no way to vent her sexual desires, but now she was inside in a Mary Sue novel. What did that mean?It was akin to bringing a starving man a table full of food. Why would she care about the mission? She was too busy stripping her clothes and spreading her legs!System: \u2026Huo Yuting stared at Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s back as she disappeared. She was dressed in a beautiful ancient dress that swayed with every step she took, making her appear as though she were a goddess from a fairy, forever pure and untainted by the earthly world.But she had drugged him and climbed into his bed. Her heart was ugly and greedy!Yet, despite this thought, Huo Yuting couldn\u2019t control the restless fire that lit up in his lower abdomen. It spread quickly throughout his body, making his eyes darken with hidden lust.He couldn\u2019t help but recall the image of her bare body pressed under him. In his memory, her skin was pale and smooth, her body sensitive and voluptuous. When he thought about her slick walls squeezing around his member, he immediately felt his pants tighten a little.Liu Luoxue was confused when she noticed Huo Yuting\u2019s dark expression. Even the air around him had turned cold.Fortunately, he quickly calmed down and met her innocent gaze. However, when her face suddenly overlapped with Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s coquettish countenance, his mood became complicated again.\u2018If I were to do it with her\u2026\u2019\u2018No! How could I bully her? She should always remain pure and untainted like she is now.\u2019Even as he thought this, a different man was thinking the same thing.It was Qin Rui, the Film Emperor. His handsome face alone was enough to ensure that he would never go hungry, yet he chose to rely on his own strength and acting ability to bring his career to the peak.He was undoubtedly one of the most powerful people in the nation.As such, he didn\u2019t expect to be drugged by someone during an ordinary business dinner.And it was by a man, at that! Qin Rui had seen his share of people who believed they could do anything as long as they were rich and powerful, but it was his first time encountering one who would project their filthy fantasies onto his body and actually act on those desires. They probably thought that since he was an actor, he would be afraid to speak up in fear of getting into a scandal.However, they\u2019d forgotten that when he first started acting, he\u2019d hired a special martial arts trainer to create a hellish training routine for him. He never stopped practicing it.Therefore, even when he was drugged, he was still much stronger than the average man. It only took him one blow to knock out the man who wanted to take advantage of him.Afterward, Qin Rui quickly went through his options. Neither his agent nor his assistant would be able to put out the fire in his body. He\u2019d already tried masturbating and found out that the drug was too strong to be dealt with on his own, and trying to endure it would only damage his body. The only thing he could do now was to find a woman to help him.He couldn\u2019t trust a stranger, so his only option was to choose from the actresses in the crew. The ones that were too popular couldn\u2019t be touched. Fortunately, there were some actresses with tepid popularity too.The first person who came to mind was Liu Luoxue, as he was rather fond of her, but he immediately dispelled the idea. Liu Luoxue was not an \u201ceasy\u201d girl.\u201cSo you came to me because you think I\u2019m easy?\u201d Ruan Jiaojiao raised an eyebrow.Just a few minutes ago when she entered the dressing room, she was picked up by Qin Rui and pressed against a wall. With his deep and magnetic voice, he\u2019d told her the story and asked her to help him.Qin Rui\u2019s thin lips pressed into a line. His forehead was already drenched in sweat. Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s body was trapped between his hot, heaving chest and the wall.Ah\u2026 the strong smell of masculinity enveloped her.To eat or not to eat?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 6": "Chapter 6 \u2013 Bigger, Thicker, Better (HH)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEven if Qin Rui didn\u2019t answer, Ruan Jiaojiao knew what he was thinking. Her reputation in the outside world was terrible right now. Obviously, he believed that she would do it as long as he agreed to her conditions.Moreover, he was the Film Emperor who had everything from looks to money to power. Never mind the other benefits, as a little star who\u2019d practically been driven out of the entertainment industry already, just sleeping with Qin Rui would allow her to brag about it afterward and thus satisfy her vanity. If she was lucky, she could even make a comeback.In any case, it was a good deal for her.Ruan Jiaojiao sighed. She touched her clean fingertips to his muscular chest and scrutinized his tall body. Compared to her, he was like a powerful eagle in front of a weak chicken.And right now, this powerful eagle\u2019s blood was boiling, his breath was hot, and his eyes were as dark as ink. Clearly, he had reached his limit. Feeling that she would have to agree even if she didn\u2019t want to, she couldn\u2019t help but sigh again.The System asked curiously, \u2018Do you really have no interest in this handsome guy?\u2019\u2018How could I not? But I feel bad for my waist\u2026 I can tell just by looking at this guy that he\u2019s the strong stallion type. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll die from overeating.\u2019System: Haha\u2026\u201cAlright.\u201dAs soon as the words fell from her lips, she didn\u2019t even have time to state her conditions before Qin Rui buried his face in her shoulder and bit down on her slender neck.&amp;nbsp;\u201cHng\u2026\u201d\u2018That hurts!\u2019Suddenly, she was reminded of Shen Muyan. As expected, there was a big difference between a little puppy and a real wolf.&amp;nbsp;\u201cNot\u2026 not here\u2026\u201dShe could feel her body weakening from how roughly he was pressing her against the wall.\u2018Seriously, this man is so insensitive!\u2019The last thing she wanted was for her body to be black and blue the next day, so she reached out and wrapped her arms around his neck, then did the same with her legs around his waist.\u201cBed\u2026 to the bed\u2026\u201dShe pushed away his relentless lips. The man seemed to be obsessed with biting and leaving red marks all over her slender neck.\u2018How am I going to leave the house tomorrow?\u2019Truthfully, she was reluctant to sleep with the second male lead. He was a loyal and doting dog for the female lead, but for the other female characters in the book, he was as cold and ruthless as a man could be. Ruan Jiaojiao never thought her bad reputation would lead him to sleep with her like this.Qin Rui carried her to the bed. She laid there quietly and obediently, letting him do whatever he wanted with her body. After all, he was currently desperate to conquer and vent. But\u2026 he looked at her calm expression and her dead-fishlike posture, as though she was being forced to accept him, and frowned.His sharp eyes darkened with gloom. Though he had always been a gentleman, Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s reluctant expression dealt a great blow to his male ego. He couldn\u2019t help but blurt out sarcastically, \u201cWhy are you trying to act innocent in front of me? That wasn\u2019t the case when you were fooling around with Shen Muyan in the dressing room!\u201dQin Rui\u2019s dressing room was next door to Shen Muyan\u2019s dressing room. When he walked by it yesterday, he had heard the woman\u2019s voice through the door. Even after he finished filming and returned to his dressing room to change, they were still going at it.At the time, he had wondered how good her body had to feel to be able to make Shen Muyan neglect his filming and stay in the dressing room for the entire day.Now, his curiosity could be satisfied, but the woman looked like he was forcing her to do it with him!When Ruan Jiaojiao heard Qin Rui\u2019s taunt, her expression remained unchanged. She didn\u2019t show any sign of embarrassment either.\u201cYou\u2019re the one who asked me to do it with you, not the other way around. I\u2019m just trying to satisfy your request by acting as an inflatable doll.\u201d Her slightly mocking tone instantly ignited his fire.\u201cInflatable doll?\u201d A dangerous storm was brewing in his dark eyes.He stopped talking and pulled off her panties with one dry, calloused, and slender finger.Ruan Jiaojiao was only wearing a loose T-shirt over her underwear, so as soon as he slid her panties off her legs, he was able to see her entrance.His Adam\u2019s apple bobbed as he stared at her soft-looking hair and pinkish folds. Then, before she could even react, he thrust his finger inside.As soon as he plunged his finger inside, he felt her hot walls clamp down around his digit.\u2018So tight?\u2019Qin Rui was a little surprised. If he thrust in all at once, could such a small hole really accommodate his entire length? However, there was no time for him to be worrying about that. His swelling member was already prepared to replace his finger and let loose inside of her, desperate to rid itself of the painfully arousing effects of the drug.He hesitated for only a second before pulling out his finger and unzipping his pants. When his shaft was finally free from its confines, he didn\u2019t even take off his pants before positioning himself at her entrance and ramming in.\u2018What the f*ck!!\u2019Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s body immediately stiffened from the pain of the sudden invasion. Without any foreplay, it was almost no different from being raped. However, she couldn\u2019t really say anything when he was already inside. She simply laid there and let him do his thing.Qin Rui entered her in one stroke, burying himself to the hilt. Then, like a wild animal with no sense or skill to speak of, he began to thrust in and out of her at a rapid speed.\u201cAhhh\u2026\u201d A series of breathless moans fell from her seductive red lips. Qin Rui\u2019s gaze, which was somewhat bloodshot from lust, fell on her delicate neck. His earlier actions had caused a reddish mark to form on her pale skin.Seeing it, he couldn\u2019t help but lower his head to suck again on that exact spot. The contrast between the redness and the white of her neck excited him even more as his member throbbed and swelled inside her. The desire to break and completely dominate her mingled with the effects of the aphrodisiac, overtaking his mind.\u201cAh, it hurts\u2026\u201d Ruan Jiaojiao furrowed her eyebrows when she felt his teeth against her neck.\u2018Is this man a dog? Why is he still biting me? What is this, a kink?!\u2019She refused to be outdone. She raised her hand and unbuttoned his black shirt. Since he was the main actor of their crew, she dared not bite him on the neck. However, this did not dissuade her. After all, she was the master of revenge.She lifted her chin and bit down on his sturdy chest.\u2018Hmph! Who told you to bite me?\u2019Qin Rui\u2019s eyebrows furrowed slightly. He was on a strict exercise plan year-round, so even if she bit him, he wouldn\u2019t feel anything.However, she didn\u2019t care and bit him again on his sensitive nub. The man\u2019s eyes narrowed and he delivered a particularly forceful thrust, causing her head to hit the bed board with a soft bang .Before the pain could register, he placed his palm on the back of her head and pressed her forehead to his.\u201cDon\u2019t play around, hm?\u201d he growled in his deep magnetic voice.She couldn\u2019t help but retort, \u201cYou bit me first!\u201dHer angry voice sounded coquettish and soft. Qin Rui felt his abdomen tighten. He looked at her body lying beneath him, drank in her red lips and pale skin, felt her slick walls squeeze tightly around his member. Her eyes were misty and charming, making his heart pound and his mind cloud with the desire to swallow her up.He never expected this forced sex to feel so good. Neither of them had wanted it. After he came inside of her once, he rubbed her perky tips through the fabric of her cotton T-shirt and felt himself get hard again.\u2018Sh*t!\u2019\u2018Is she a vixen?\u2019He suddenly recalled the sounds he had heard from her and the newbie, Shen Muyan, the other day and felt a little sour.\u2018So she likes the weak, scrawny type?\u2019Clearly, he was much bigger, thicker, and better than him. Shouldn\u2019t women be more infatuated with his type when it came to sex?T/N: These men gotta control their egos, dang where\u2019s my Muyan?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

A gloomy expression was present on his face, and his fists were clenched tightly in anger.It was Huo Yuting.She was still in the mood to be fooling around in bed with another man? Her situation was already in a dire state. She should have taken the initiative to find him and begged him to forgive her!He knew he should leave, but his body refused to listen. Through the door, he could hear the ambiguous gasps and groans of the pair inside. His feet were nailed to the floor, and as he continued to listen to those sounds, he felt his pants begin to tighten around his crotch area.The memory of that night, of her exquisite body and delicate skin, surfaced in his mind. Just one touch had made him want to possess her and cover her entire body with his traces. He\u2019d thought that the overwhelming ecstasy and excitement he felt when he entered her was only an effect of the aphrodisiac.But when he heard the sound of the shower in the bathroom and imagined her wet body dripping with water and recalled his seed flowing down her slender thighs, his member became so hard that he thought it would explode.The stronger his desire grew, the more he hated it and rejected it. On one side was his carnal instincts, and on the other was his rationality. Therefore, even though he had wanted nothing more than to rush inside the bathroom and indulge in her body again, he resisted. As a result, his dream that night was filled with her charming visage.Huo Yuting didn\u2019t know what was wrong with him. Instead of killing her like he had planned, he waited\u2026He waited for her to find him and use that night as blackmail to force him to agree to a demand. But she didn\u2019t.&amp;nbsp;Therefore, he made a move. He thought to teach the woman a lesson, but he was merciful, destroying only her reputation so she would struggle a little more with her career. He wanted to see how she would react, and if her fox\u2019s tail would come out.Yet\u2026She sounded like she was enjoying herself with the man inside the room. Huo Yuting could hear her loud moans and breathless gasps from behind the door. They were a stark contrast to how she had sounded when she was with him.It was an obvious slap to his face!The more he thought about it, the darker his expression became.&amp;nbsp;Was she secretly thinking about and laughing at him now, just like she did that night?Speaking of, just how long were they planning to keep going for?!Huo Yuting looked at his watch. Forty minutes had already passed, yet there was no sign of them stopping any time soon. On the contrary, the sounds were growing in intensity. He could hear the rapid collisions of their bodies against the bed board. For some reason, he felt like a husband who had been cheated on and wanted to rush in to catch the adulterers in bed.That d*mned woman, how dare she look down on him!He wanted to see just who she was in bed with right now, which wild man was making her sound like that. A capable man should be working hard to earn money, not rolling in the sheets with a cheap woman!After almost an hour of listening to Ruan Jiaojiao and Qin Rui\u2019s coupling, the male lead\u2019s thoughts were beginning to become muddled. Of course, the thoughts of pair inside the room weren\u2019t any less muddled, though for a somewhat different reason.T/N: This man needs to control his ego lmaoPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8 \u2013 Hard and Soft (HH)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayQin Rui was sure that the woman beneath him was a vixen, and she was going to suck him dry\u2026He\u2019d already came inside of her countless times, pumped her so full of his seed that it had long begun to spill from the place they were connected, yet as soon as his hand came in contact with her tender body, his limp member would harden again.It was never-ending. Once again, he entered her slippery walls, causing a spurt of their combined fluids to gush out of her entrance. He was insatiable. He wanted to stay inside her forever, greedily take her for himself, meld their bodies into one.He wanted to attribute this obsession to the effects of the aphrodisiac, or the buildup of stress from how busy he had been lately, but he knew those were only excuses. Although his muscles were beginning to feel a little sore, his actual stamina was a different story. His sexual libido was like that of a pervert\u2026Yes, Qin Rui felt like an insatiable pervert . Despite finishing inside her so many times already, he was still not satisfied. He still had to film tomorrow.On both the inside and the outside, he had always been a disciplined, rational, and unshakeable workaholic. Wholly dedicated to his career, he\u2019d never coveted or been addicted to anything. That was how he succeeded in reaching the pinnacle of the entertainment circle.As for women, it wasn\u2019t like he hadn\u2019t filmed any romance or bed scenes with them before. However, even during those scenes, he would be entirely focused on giving a flawless performance, trying his best to figure out the perfect camera angle and emotions to show for the character he was playing, as well as the people who would watch the drama or film. He paid the women no attention at all. As soon as the director yelled \u201ccut!\u201d he would quickly withdraw from his character state and return to being the indifferent, arrogant, and courteous Qin Rui.But right now, his mind was yelling at him to stop. He should leave this woman\u2019s body. He shouldn\u2019t indulge in this vulgar activity. He should take a shower. He shouldn\u2019t let his body be covered in sticky sweat and body fluids.The smell of obscenity in the room was almost tangible. This was an act of depravity and indulgence, an act he had once disdained and despised.But he couldn\u2019t stop.Like a relentless machine, he continued to slide in and out of her body. As though it was an acting performance he was dissatisfied with, he redid it over and over again.Meanwhile, Ruan Jiaojiao was exhausted.&amp;nbsp;The man\u2019s enthusiasm had become too much for her, and she wanted nothing more than to lift her foot and kick him away. However, he caught her as soon as she tried to escape. His sharp eyes were locked on her, as though he was a hunter, and she was his prey.Her attempt to flee was met with a punishment. He pulled out and thrust back in, burying himself to the hilt in a single hard stroke, eliciting a weak and pained groan from the tired woman.&amp;nbsp;The sound made his blood boil. He wanted to throw himself into this carnality and forget everything else.Was it because he had suppressed himself for too long?When he gave one particularly hard thrust, Ruan Jiaojiao felt her head smack against the headboard. She hissed in pain.This was precisely the reason she hesitated when he asked her to help him. She\u2019d had no clue what this man was like in bed.And as it turned out, he had both terrifying physical strength and stamina! She had a feeling she was going to be too sore to get out of bed tomorrow.Even as she was lamenting over the fate of her poor body, she felt a rush of molten heat flood her walls. The man had come again.He pulled back slightly, allowing a stream of sticky white liquid to flow out of her entrance, drenching the bedsheets.He pulled her into his arms and sighed. This woman was just like her name; her soft and delicate body was so addicting that he never wanted to stop f*cking her.His gaze fell on her T-shirt. They had not taken it off during the intercourse, so the fabric was a little wrinkled and stained with a few drops of a certain fluid.Their bodies had remained together in the same standard military position the entire time, the main reason being that he thought it was a good position. The sight of her snow-white legs, spread wide open and folded around his waist as her walls squeezed around his member, was already enough to drive him crazy. Her voluptuous chest would also bounce and tremble with every thrust.Another reason, one that he didn\u2019t want to admit, was that he didn\u2019t know any other positions.Reaching out, he carefully lifted up her T-shirt, finally revealing her tantalizing upper body. Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s eyes were filled with tears after being fed to the brim.She wanted to rest, but when she felt her T-shirt being lifted up and a rough finger touch her sensitive bud, she couldn\u2019t help but tremble. Then, she saw the cold and indifferent Film Emperor Qin Rui slowly lower his head\u2026 and take the bud inside his wet mouth.\u2018Oh, my god! Goosebumps\u2026\u2019\u2018This is killing me\u2026\u2019When the person in question was a typical hardcore straight man, even the smallest changes in their actions could cause a distinct gap moe.In Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s mind, Qin Rui\u2019s domineering and majestic presence on set, an awe-inspiring image of an iron-blooded knight riding on a horse, was now overlapping with the image of him lying on her chest, wantonly licking and biting at her aroused peaks.It was clearly the same face, yet the latter was so much more obscene\u2026She suddenly felt a small pinch on her stiff legs, causing her to flinch and instinctively squeeze them tighter around his waist.\u201cYou\u2026 Don\u2019t bite\u2026 \u201d she scolded half-heartedly.Qin Rui raised his head and looked at her. His lips lifted in a smirk, and all of a sudden, his dignified face seemed to fill with sinful mischief. Then, before she could react, he shoved his thick member inside her again. With the help of their combined fluids from the previous rounds, it slid through her walls with no effort at all.\u2018Godd*mmit, this beast!\u2019But\u2026 she liked it!He felt immensely satisfied but also confused. Why was he still unsatiated despite having released inside her so many times already? He began to examine his own physiological needs.When Ruan Jiaojiao felt him stop moving inside her, she opened her eyes. The sight of her hazy eyes immediately made him harder. He withdrew slightly and slammed inside, burying himself to the hilt, and pulled back again before repeating his actions. The tip of his member collided with her cervix over and over again. As the wet sounds of their flesh slapping together filled the room, Qin Rui caught her gaze and refused to let her look away.His hips moved back and forth without rest. He was like a decisive general on the battlefield, engaged in a long battle. His muscles were sore, his blood boiling, his eyes red with desire. Her moans, as well as the obscene sounds of their union, sounded like the beating of a war drum, urging him to fight harder.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dRuan Jiaojiao could not bear his simple and crude thrusting. Her body felt numb and sensitive to the extreme. She immediately abandoned her armor and weapons and surrendered.More juices leaked from her entrance, flowed down the place they were connected, and made a bigger mess on the bedsheets.Though she was already stuffed to the brim, he was still trying to feed her more. His hard shaft continued to stir up her insides.\u201cAre you done yet? My body is going to break if you keep going!\u201d she frowned and complained angrily.As the renowned Film Emperor, no one in their crew dared to act carelessly around him. He stood at the top of the pyramid, worlds away from everyone else, yet right now, he was being disdained by a little actress.Qin Rui wanted to vent his anger, but he couldn\u2019t. His hard member was still inside her body, frozen in a mid-thrust. He wanted to continue, but the other party said no. In this case, he should be an elegant gentleman and leave.But her walls were sucking so fiercely on his member\u2026 it felt so good that despite his rationality, he wanted to continue. Therefore, he pretended to be deaf. He decided to ignore what she said and quickly finish first before saying anything.However, the irritated Ruan Jiaojiao wasn\u2019t taking it. Completely disregarding what he wanted, she lifted her leg and gave him an utterly heartless kick in the abdomen.\u201cGo away! I don\u2019t want to do it!! I\u2019m tired!\u201d She barely held herself back from directly telling him to screw off.\u201cBehave\u2026 just a little longer,\u201d he breathed in her ear. His voice was deep and husky and sounded so sexy that she thought her ears were going to become pregnant.But she didn\u2019t fall for it. She kicked him in the leg and hissed, \u201cBehave my ass, get off me!\u201dQin Rui caught her ankle and also felt irritated. This woman changed faces too quickly. She was moaning in pleasure just a second ago, then as soon as she was satisfied, she switched to trying to kick him away?Ruan Jiaojiao struggled to free herself from his grip but to no avail, so she raised her claws and scratched at him. Fortunately, she cut her nails, otherwise, they would have left a few scratches on the Film Emperor\u2019s sexy body.At this point, he had no choice but to pull out of her. He sighed helplessly as he looked at his member. It was glistening with her juices.Pulling down her t-shirt, she grabbed her phone and checked the time.\u2018Oh, my god!\u2019Two hours!No wonder she couldn\u2019t feel her legs!Her legs had been spread wide open for two hours as he pounded her nonstop. Who wouldn\u2019t feel sore after that?! She thrust her phone in his face and said huffily, \u201cLook at the time!\u201dQin Rui didn\u2019t realize how much time had passed until he saw her phone screen. He was so immersed in the pleasure that he hadn\u2019t felt the passage of time at all.When Ruan Jiaojiao finished speaking, she felt the last bit of energy drain from her body. The other side of the bed sank down, and she looked over to see Qin Rui lying down with his eyes closed. His breathing was steady as though he had fallen asleep.She laid down too and turned her back to him, too tired to care about his presence.\u2018He\u2019ll leave when he\u2019s slept enough,\u2019 she thought.And with that, she fell asleep.T/N: Phew\u2026 \ud83e\udd75Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Judging from the rhythm of her breathing, she had fallen asleep. Dissatisfied with her posture, he gently grabbed her shoulder and turned her over to face him.As expected, the woman did not react. She was sound asleep.He stared at her face. She looked attractive even without any makeup on, and from his experience just now, he knew her voluptuous body was completely natural.This rare beauty had been pressed under him, and she\u2019d allowed him to do whatever he wanted with her body. To tell the truth, he felt a great sense of satisfaction from their coupling, both physically and mentally.He actually had some impressions of her performance on set.She was neither a good actress nor a hard worker. Why was she wasting her time in the entertainment circle if she had no intentions to climb higher?To find a gold master?When the image of this woman being pressed under another man suddenly surfaced in his mind, he felt a little unhappy.Though he had no interest in the affairs between men and women, he didn\u2019t feel comfortable letting other men touch a woman he had been in bed with.Ruan Jiaojiao woke up after a short twenty minutes. After all, she was in an unfamiliar room, so she couldn\u2019t relax and sleep for a long time no matter how tired she was. She sat up and stretched before slowly opening her eyes. To her astonishment, another pair of eyes, deeper and sharper, were staring back at her. Her grogginess disappeared in an instant.&amp;nbsp;\u2018What the hell, why is he still here?!\u2019\u201cAren\u2019t you filming today?\u201dThe man in her bed was the main character of their crew. This was a blatant display of skipping work and abusing one\u2019s authority, wasn\u2019t it?Well, he could definitely afford it.But this man was the Film Emperor, who was said to be married to his job!\u201cI want to talk to you.\u201d Qin Rui\u2019s tone was serious. He exuded an imposing aura of authority that made people unconsciously submit.But\u2026\u201cThen talk,\u201d Ruan Jiaojiao responded dismissively.His eyebrows furrowed slightly as he watched her get out of bed without bothering to cover herself up. The mess on the bedsheet was unceremoniously revealed, and she didn\u2019t even want to look at the dried traces between her thighs.\u201cHurry up, I need to take a bath.\u201d\u201cTogether.\u201dShe froze for a brief moment as the man got off the bed and walked into the bathroom without saying another word. Pretending to reject him would be pointless, so she followed him in.After the short nap, the two had regained some energy and thus went for another round in the bathroom.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dHer hands roamed his body and touched the legendary package between his legs. He truly deserved to be ranked first in the list of top sexiest male stars in the entertainment circle.\u201cHnng\u2026 Don\u2019t stop\u2026 Faster\u2026\u201dHer body was enclosed in his strong arms, her legs wrapped around his waist, her back pressed against the wall. Stuck between the cold ceramic tiles and his hot, muscular body, Ruan Jiaojiao felt like a delicate flower caught in a violent storm.Due to her poor stamina, her body quickly lost its strength. She leaned against his chest, her nails digging into his back. Everything about him was hard, which made her feel pleasure and pain at the same time.\u201cAlready?\u201d he teased in a low voice.\u201cHow can I compare to your rock-hard body that\u2019s been trained every day for god knows how long?\u201d she retorted, digging her nails deeper into his back. It was a pity they were trimmed.She still remembered the embarrassing red scratch she\u2019d made on Shen Muyan\u2019s back that day. However, he hadn\u2019t minded at all and even comforted her with a smile. His role did not require him to take off his clothes.Although the youth\u2019s figure was not as built as Qin Rui\u2019s, he had a lean physique and sinfully long legs. Since the main lead was skipping today, Shen Muyan was probably in the middle of filming one of his own scenes in advance.When Qin Rui noticed she had turned silent, he lifted her chin and saw the absentminded expression on her face. His self-esteem suddenly took a hit. Consequently, the atmosphere around them changed, becoming colder as his face sunk.After all, he was no longer under the effects of the aphrodisiac. Though he was still reluctant to pull out of her, he was able to control himself this time.Afterward\u2026\u201cDidn\u2019t you want to talk to me?\u201dRuan Jiaojiao walked out of the bathroom with a towel wrapped around her chest. She saw Qin Rui, fully dressed already, with his hand on the doorknob. He looked back at her, his image restored to that of the cold and indifferent Film Emperor, and said coldly, \u201cThink about what you want in return for this, then we can find time to talk.\u201dAnd with that, he left.\u2018Tch, putting on airs now? What the hell is wrong with him?\u2019Ruan Jiaojiao cursed, though she didn\u2019t really mind. She knew that the gentle Qin Rui depicted in the original story was reserved for the female lead only.As far as her personal preference was concerned, Ruan Jiaojiao still preferred Shen Muyan\u2019s type over Qin Rui. Sex with Shen Muyan was pleasurable, and she didn\u2019t have to sacrifice her legs to enjoy it.T/N: If you previously read on Sultric Translations, you may have noticed that the chapter numbers don\u2019t match up, and there\u2019s a time gap between the release dates on the NU page. That\u2019s because I split my chapters in order to accommodate my 5x/week schedule at the time, but chapter splitting is forbidden on SLT unless the English word count is over 3k, so I merged all of the split chapters. Chapter 9 on Sultric is equivalent to Chapter 6 on SLT. NU replaced the links and changed the translation group but not the release dates.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10 \u2013 Stirring Up TroublePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHuo Yuting was waiting for Ruan Jiaojiao, and so was Qin Rui.They thought that since she\u2019d slept with them, she would ask for something in return, whether it be in the form of a condition or blackmail. They even thought up several countermeasures to deal with her in case her demand was too exorbitant.And the result of all this preparation was\u2026 Nothing.Ruan Jiaojiao lived like a monk without paying them any heed, simply eating, drinking, and sleeping whenever she wanted. Huo Yuting and Qin Rui\u2019s reaction to this was the same; they both believed that she had deeper motives and was deliberately ignoring them.But the truth was, she forgot.Every day, she and her favorite Shen Muyan would seize every opportunity to hug and touch each other and then roll the sheets in various positions. She was extremely happy and tired at the same time.The young man was good in bed and had an endearing personality, and best of all, he always switched seamlessly between acting like a small puppy and a hungry wolf. When the small puppy was given meat, he would turn into a fierce, wild wolf, but when he was full, he would revert back to being a cute puppy\u2026\u201cMuyan, I really like you\u2026\u201dQin Rui had just finished filming his scenes and was returning to his dressing room to change. When he passed by Shen Muyan\u2019s dressing room, he heard the woman\u2019s charming voice from behind the door and halted his steps.\u201cNgh\u2026 I like you so much\u2026\u201d she cried out again.This time, he heard the woman\u2019s voice clearly. His expression stiffened and became dark, then he felt that his anger was wrong. He knew Ruan Jiaojiao was having an affair with Shen Muyan, he\u2019d heard them before.Then why was he angry? Because she was ignoring him?Qin Rui sneered coldly. He should have expected this from that lascivious woman.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Senior Qin?\u201dHe gave the girl beside him a sidelong glance. She was blinking up at him with a pair of innocent eyes.\u201cAhem!\u201d he coughed suddenly, loudly, as if to tell the couple inside that there were people outside. And sure enough, the room became silent.Afterward, Qin Rui felt secretly annoyed. That woman was completely shameless, so why did he cover up for her? Her reputation was already in the dirt anyway.Once Qin Rui and Liu Luoxue were gone, Ruan Jiaojiao laughed while Shen Muyan\u2019s face flushed with embarrassment. The two were currently nestled on the couch with her body straddling his thighs. From the top up, they looked completely normal; however, the youth\u2019s trousers were lowered to his feet, and the woman\u2019s skirt was raised to her waist.From this, it was obvious that they were doing something unspeakable.When they were enjoying themselves a moment ago, Ruan Jiaojiao had felt so good that she couldn\u2019t help but praise him. She liked to tease him and watch his shy reactions. Just now, she was enthusiastically bouncing herself on his shaft when a deep, masculine cough sounded from the door, causing Shen Muyan to immediately lose control and shoot out inside her.Ruan Jiaojiao collapsed on the couch and started to laugh. As he watched her laugh, he felt slightly annoyed.\u2018She\u2019s still laughing\u2026\u2019And it was making his heart melt\u2026Before long, he couldn\u2019t help but join her laughter.\u201cJiaojiao, your part in this drama is going to end soon. What are you going to do next?\u201d he asked afterward, his eyes filled with anticipation and determination.\u201cCall me jiejie .\u201dShe pinched his smooth cheeks.\u201cNothing much, I\u2019ll do whatever my company gives me. If there\u2019s nothing, then I\u2019ll just chill at home.\u201d\u201cThen can I accompany you?\u201d He finally said what was on his mind.She raised an eyebrow and joked, \u201cHow could I let you do that? Your agent won\u2019t allow it either. You\u2019re making it big now, you know?\u201d\u201cHe can\u2019t control me.\u201d Shen Muyan didn\u2019t care about what his agent thought.Ruan Jiaojiao knew that this young master was rich and willful, so he wasn\u2019t lying. However, although she was moved by this proposal, she still refused.\u201cMuyan, when I leave, \u2018we\u2019 will also be over.\u201dHe looked at her in disbelief.\u201cI\u2019m in a scandal right now, and I\u2019ve been in it for a long time already. If you get caught being together with me, your reputation will be damaged too,\u201d she explained solemnly.He lowered his head and asked in a somewhat dejected tone, \u201cAre you serious?\u201d\u201cMhm\u2026 but if you miss me, I don\u2019t mind if you come to find me. Or if I miss you, I\u2019ll go over to you!\u201dSystem: You\u2019re so freaking shameless!Ruan Jiaojiao immediately retorted, \u2018Bite me!\u2019The System lit a candle for the innocent pretty boy.\u201cJiaojiao, maybe you should leave the circle.\u201d He suddenly raised his head and looked at her with a sincere expression. Then, as if afraid she would misunderstand, he immediately continued, \u201cI don\u2019t want to see you being cursed at by those people. Leave the entertainment circle and let me support you.\u201dShe looked at him in surprise. \u201cAre you going to take care of me?\u201dShen Muyan was stunned. He didn\u2019t expect her to say it so directly, but he nodded regardless.\u201cIf you want to put it that way, yes.\u201dRuan Jiaojiao was overjoyed. Who would\u2019ve thought that she would receive an offer to be kept by a man one day?But on the outside, she showed a different reaction. Her eyes were filled with disappointment and hurt.\u201cSo you think I\u2019m that type of person too.\u201d\u201cNo!\u201d Shen Muyan reached out to hold her, but she pretended to be heartbroken and refused to listen to him.\u201cShen Muyan, I was wrong about you. I don\u2019t like you anymore!\u201d As soon as she finished saying this line, she ran out of the dressing room. The System watched this dog blood drama scene play out in silence.He chased after her anxiously and unwittingly, they reached the set. Ruan Jiaojiao spotted the female lead and second male lead talking in a corner and strode over.Liu Luoxue was asking Qin Rui for acting advice when she saw another actress walk over.\u201cMr. Qin, about what you told me last time,\u201d Ruan Jiaojiao started.Yeah?Yeah?After saying that, she looked at Shen Muyan. He returned her gaze without looking away.\u201cI\u2019ve decided on what I want,\u201d she said, putting on a beautiful smile.T/N: Didn\u2019t get that hallway confrontation everyone was anticipating, rip.On another note, I get that she only approached him to get the papapa and Shen Muyan is probably confusing sexual attraction for romantic feelings, there\u2019s little reason for our FL to actually fall in love with him if you think about it, but still \ud83d\ude2d why she gotta hurt the smol baby like that??On yet another note, a lovely reader found some pictures to represent our three male characters so far:<figure><figure></figure> <figure></figure> <figure></figure></figure>They\u2019re all smexy but personally, I imagine them like this:<figure><figure></figure> <figure></figure> <figure></figure></figure>Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

(H)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe System couldn\u2019t suppress its curiosity and asked her what she was trying to do.Ruan Jiaojiao put down her lipstick and gazed at her beautiful face in the mirror.\u2018I love this beautiful face. I\u2019m going to be a big beauty in the next world too, right?\u2019System: \u2026 Why are you thinking about the next world already? You\u2019re not even halfway done with this world yet.\u2018Because I\u2019m bored,\u2019 Ruan Jiaojiao replied.And in order to relieve her boredom, she\u2019d purposely stirred up some drama. She also wanted to see if Shen Muyan would fall in love with the female lead, thus following the original storyline, if she left him alone for a while.Between Shen Muyan, Huo Yuting, and Qin Rui, Shen Muyan was the one she shared the closest relationship with, but it was purely a physical attraction. Shen Muyan had never tasted a woman or been in a relationship like this before so he didn\u2019t know better, but Ruan Jiaojiao did.System: What if he does?She smiled. \u2018Guess.\u2019System: \u201cGuess\u201d my ass!\u2018Say\u2026 What is the mission?\u2019The System retaliated: Guess.She fell silent.It was all because she was too excited about receiving the System that she didn\u2019t pay attention to what it was saying.\u2018If the key to the mission doesn\u2019t appear, will I be stuck in this world regardless of if I fail or succeed?\u2019The System responded unapologetically: Ding, ding, ding, correct!Ruan Jiaojiao began to think hard.\u2018F*ck! What is the mission?!\u2019***In the middle of the night, Shen Muyan knocked on Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s door.Ruan Jiaojiao opened the door. She was wearing only a bath towel around her body, her delicate skin still damp from a shower.\u201cYes?\u201dHe felt a knot form in his throat as his lower abdomen tightened.\u201cJiaojiao\u2026\u201d he whimpered, wanting to be let inside.But as soon as he looked into the apartment, he saw another man on her bed. He was sitting there with the blanket pooled around his waist, his upper half completely exposed. The man looked over with a sharp gaze, bringing with it a heavy, invisible pressure.Shen Muyan\u2019s eyes widened, and his entire body froze up. Ruan Jiaojiao looked at him, and before she could say anything, he turned around and ran. He was gone within seconds.\u201cIs that your condition?\u201d Qin Rui pulled back the covers and walked over to her.In return for her help last time, she asked him to be her partner in this little dog-blood play.\u201cMhm. You can go now.\u201dShe yawned and climbed into bed, ready to turn in for the day. However, he stayed by her bed and stared at her without speaking for a good minute or two.\u201cWhat? You\u2019re not going to act like a beast again, are you?\u201d she sneered slightly as her eyes closed shut.Qin Rui had no idea what this woman was thinking.She seemed to care a lot about Shen Muyan, yet she got rid of him using such a cruel method. But if she really had feelings for Shen Muyan, why didn\u2019t she refuse him when he asked her to help with the aphrodisiac?Maybe she had her own reasons and was suffering on the inside. Even as Qin Rui thought this and considered whether or not to comfort her, she suddenly opened her eyes and sat up.She reached for him, her soft arms coiling his neck and her legs around his waist.\u201cYou can stay, but I\u2019m going to say this first\u2026 you have to stop if I say to stop. I have the final say.\u201dHer movements caused the bath towel to unravel and fall onto the bed. Her soft, full chest pressed directly against his. Qin Rui felt himself get hard as soon as he reached down and touched her smooth buttocks.Their bodies were no longer strangers to each other.As they entangled on the bed, he unzipped his pants and directly shoved himself inside her, causing her to groan.\u201cBe gentle, assh*le!\u201d Ruan Jiaojiao scolded.Qin Rui\u2019s eyes narrowed. No one else would dare to scold him like this. Moreover, her tone was filled with obvious, genuine disdain. She wasn\u2019t trying to play coy.However, what could he do when he was already buried inside her body? To begin with, he could not remember a single instance when this woman played by the rules.Qin Rui pulled out and paused for a moment, then he controlled his strength and speed and slowly slid back in. He tried to do it gently, but her walls were already drenched in her juices.Just as he was contemplating whether to speed up, she spoke up in a commanding tone.\u201cMn\u2026 now go faster, and harder.\u201dAlthough it coincided with his intentions, he felt strange taking orders from her.After one round, she decided she was satisfied enough with his service. Thus, she happily closed her eyes and prepared to lie down again and sleep.It took Qin Rui a few seconds to register and react to her actions.\u2018Did she fall asleep?!\u2019Just as this infuriating thought crossed his mind, she opened her eyes just a crack and looked at him.\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you gone yet?\u201d she asked somewhat impatiently.Film Emperor Qin, who was recognized as the good-natured and gentlemanly representative of the entertainment circle, immediately burst into anger. He pressed down on her and forcefully grabbed her wrist with one hand, forcing her to open her eyes and straighten her attitude.He thought Ruan Jiaojiao would resist, and he wanted to take this opportunity to teach her a lesson. However, to his surprise, she did the opposite. Her drowsiness dissipated in an instant. She blinked her eyes and suggested with enthusiasm, \u201cI\u2019ve never tried a rape fantasy before. I\u2019m feeling it right now, so let\u2019s do a roleplay!\u201dQin Rui: \u2026Was this an invitation to \u201crape\u201d her?What the heck was this woman\u2019s brain filled with?System: It\u2019s filled with dirty thoughts, all dirty thoughts!T/N: I saw a review condemning RJJ for making light of rape, and I wanted to say this: Having a rape fantasy does not mean you want to be raped or that you\u2019re making light of rape and its victims. Google \u201crape fantasy\u201d and you\u2019ll learn that a \u201crape fantasy\u201d is a sexual roleplay fetish whose dynamics have nothing to do with the horrifying act of rape. I doubt anyone would want to put themselves through such a traumatizing experience on purpose.Why is \u201cBDSM\u201d accepted by more people than \u201crape fantasy\u201d? Because of the name. The word \u201crape\u201d is a disturbing one that carries infinite negative connotations, and this fantasy just so happens to be named after it. For that reason, many women are ashamed to admit that they have these fantasies. A better name would be \u201c consensual ravishment,\u201d or simply \u201crough/forceful sex.\u201d I want to emphasize that a \u201crape fantasy\u201d derives from the desire to be forcibly ravished\u2014with consent \u2014to submit and surrender under a domineering force (and that\u2019s not weird at all considering BDSM is a thing) and to be so desperately craved for by a man that he cannot stop himself from taking her.Thank you for listening to my Podcast *bows*Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Donation bonus chapter count: 1/4 released.Ruan Jiaojiao lounged in a chair with a bottle of milk in hand. When Qin Rui left her room that night, his face was ugly. Just thinking about it made her want to laugh.Anyway, the scene she would shoot today was the death scene of her character. As soon as she entered the filming studio, however, her attention was drawn by the System\u2019s high-pitched exclamation.\u2018Wow, the plot sure moves fast! Shen Muyan and the female lead have already gotten familiar with each other!\u2019Before she could respond, it burst out again.\u2018Ooh, the male lead! The male lead has appeared!!\u2019As soon as Ruan Jiaojiao looked up, she spotted the slender figure of the man who\u2019d just entered the studio. He was surrounded by an entourage of assistants and exuded the obtrusive aura of a domineering president.The man\u2019s gaze landed on Shen Muyan and Liu Luoxue. The pair was eye-catching and well-matched. They were both smiling, and the atmosphere around them was harmonious. As they chatted quietly, their bodies were gradually moving closer and closer to each other.Ruan Jiaojiao remembered a part of the original story where Huo Yuting became jealous after seeing how close Shen Muyan and Liu Luoxue were. It was the trigger point for a series of other events.However, there were too many people in the studio at this time. Huo Yuting\u2019s face was completely expressionless. His gaze moved from Shen Muyan and Liu Luoxue and swept around the studio. Ruan Jiaojiao was casually looking at him from afar when his gaze suddenly stopped on her.&amp;nbsp;After a few seconds, he looked away.\u2026 And looked back again.Compared to Liu Luoxue, Huo Yuting\u2019s gaze stayed on Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s face for nearly five seconds before moving away. Upon realizing this, the eyes of their gossip-privy onlookers immediately filled with interest.Ruan Jiaojiao curled her lips. Despite herself, she felt goosebumps run down her spine. His cold gaze was really no joke.\u2018Ugh, forget it. I\u2019m out of here after today anyway.\u2019The filming began.Qin Rui and his men stormed into the palace. In this drama, Ruan Jiaojiao played the role of a minor antagonist. She gave a few off-handed waves of her sword and waited for Qin Rui to stab her so she could leave and have lunch.Unexpectedly, when the time came, she felt a genuine sense of danger and fear from his acting. Her body immediately reacted, causing her legs to soften. Her knees knocked painfully against the floor. When she lifted her head, she immediately burst out in tears.\u2018Wu\u2026 it hurts\u2026\u2019Naturally, Qin Rui\u2019s sword ended up slicing the empty air, but as the Film Emperor, he was skilled at adapting to the various inevitable mishaps that occur on set. Thus, he managed to finish the scene without having to redo it.Even after the director shouted \u201cCut!\u201d, Ruan Jiaojiao failed to recover from the fright and remained sitting on the floor. Fortunately, the director did not scold her.After all, mistakes like hers were not uncommon during fighting scenes and could be fixed with editing. Ruan Jiaojiao secretly sighed in relief. Fortunately, her role was an unimportant one.\u201cAre you alright?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d\u201cJiaojiao\u2026\u201dShe looked up in surprise.At this moment, the atmosphere is extremely strange.Qin Rui, Shen Muyan, and Huo Yuting were all standing in front of her while she was collapsed on the floor, looking up at the three handsome yet different men. After being blinded for a few seconds, she suddenly realized, \u2018Oh, sh*t! Isn\u2019t this the classic falling scene seen in most Mary Sue novels?\u2019\u2018Will I get the same treatment a typical female lead?\u2019Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s eyes suddenly brightened.

At the same time, a black Maybach drive up and stopped in front of her. The window rolled down, revealing Huo Yuting\u2019s handsome face.\u201cGet in the car.\u201dHis tone was always so curt and commanding.Ruan Jiaojiao, of course, was not as polite and humble as the female lead was. She immediately opened the door and got in.The car ride was silent, which tickled her mischievous side and made her want to tease the female lead\u2019s man.Their meeting was inevitable, but who told the female lead to lay her hands on her little pretty boy so soon? Although she knew it was due to the power of the plot and the female lead\u2019s Mary Sue halo, Ruan Jiaojiao still felt upset when she thought about it.\u201cMr. Huo, did you miss me?\u201dHuo Yuting was thinking about what to say to this woman to straighten her attitude and made her apologize and ask for his forgiveness when she suddenly fell on his lap and rested her claws on his crotch.While he was frozen in shock, she stroked his member through his pants. Her buttocks were raised and rubbed against his body. Although the driver in the front seat was expressionless, his mind was going crazy.\u2018Holy sh*t!\u2019He had not seen such an exciting scene in his several years of driving!!!Huo Yuting wanted to push the woman away and tell her to get out of the car, but his member was currently gripped in her hands, almost as though she was threatening him. She smiled and whispered hotly in his ear.\u201cYou\u2019re hard. Want me to help you?\u201dThe cold aura exuding from his body was terrifying, but she didn\u2019t back down. Society in this story world was ruled by the law. The most he could do to get revenge on her was ruin her career in the entertainment circle. She was only a third-rate actress anyway, so it wouldn\u2019t be a big deal at all.No matter how she played around, she would not die unless it was by suicide. As she was thinking this, she suddenly felt a grip on her wrist.\u201cYou want to die, don\u2019t you?\u201d Huo Yuting growled.\u201cNo, I want to sleep with you.\u201dShe fearlessly parted her lips and licked the shell of his ear.Half an hour later\u2026He threw her onto the large bed of his presential suite. The mattress was so soft that she sank in and didn\u2019t feel hurt at all. She quickly sat up on the bed.\u201cWhat, didn\u2019t you want to sleep with me?\u201dHuo Yuting grabbed her wrist again, this time with so much force that it almost crushed her bones. His cold gaze was like a thousand needles prickling into her face, but as his body drew closer, she could sense his arousal and impatience with ease.\u201cTsk\u2026 Don\u2019t you think I\u2019m dirty?\u201dRuan Jiaojiao felt that the direction the current plot was going was a little off. Did this man take the wrong medicine again?His eyes narrowed dangerously.\u201cDirty? You are dirty,\u201d he agreed.

As soon as he heard the bathroom door close, he realized what he had done.He\u2019d agreed to sleep with that lascivious woman!!But if he left now, she would laugh at and mock him\u2026 again.That\u2019s right!

She put on the bathrobe pre-prepared by the hotel and happily hummed to herself as she prepared to step out of the bathroom. The sight that greeted her when she opened the door, however, immediately put a stop to her humming.Huo Yuting was looking at her with an impossibly dark look on his face. He was even gnashing his teeth.\u201cErr\u2026 I think I have something else to do today\u2026\u201d she said hesitatingly.The murderous expression on his face immediately reminded her of how the leads in some Mary Sue novels would start out with a bloody love-hate relationship before falling in love.It was definitely a fun type of relationship to read about in novels, but experiencing it in real life? It was the same as asking to be abused, okay?Ruan Jiaojiao carefully retreated backward into the bathroom and retrieved her clothes, but she didn\u2019t change out of the bathrobe. She just wanted to bolt as quickly as possible. The man didn\u2019t stop her when she walked to the door, but when she tried to turn the doorknob, it refused to bulge.\u2018F*ck, he locked the door!\u2019All of a sudden, she felt a chill run down her spine. She slowly turned around to see Huo Yuting\u2019s eyes narrowing dangerously as he advanced toward her step by step.\u201cStop!\u201d she yelled, thrusting out her palm.\u201cIf you come any closer, I\u2019ll call the police!\u201dMomentarily stunned by her defensive yet imposing stance, his steps faltered. His expression stiffened and quickly turned cold.\u201cDidn\u2019t you say you wanted to sleep with me? Why are you trying to run now?\u201dThis turn of events caused his expression to ease. His eyes filled with doubt.&amp;nbsp;The corner of Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s lips twitched when she heard him, and she responded, \u201cI did say that, but why did you look like you wanted to murder me? Do you know how terrifying that was?\u201dShe patted her chest and plastered on a look of fear.Huo Yuting stiffened. The \u201cmurderous expression\u201d had been, in fact, a completely unintentional side effect of the mental battle going on inside his head. But was he going to tell her that? Obviously not! He would only be ridiculed by her if he did. Just the thought of her disdainful expression that night made him uncomfortable.\u2018Sh*t, this d*mned vixen!\u2019Snapping out of his thoughts, he gestured for her to walk closer.\u201cCome here.\u201dHowever, Ruan Jiaojiao kept her hand on the doorknob and showed no sign of moving.\u201cYou think I\u2019m gonna go over and sleep with you just because you told me to? What\u2019s in it for me?\u201d she drawled.Huo Yuting was stunned, then he sneered.\u201cWhat do you want?\u201dMoney? Resources?Right now, the male lead of the story, the female lead\u2019s thickest golden thigh, was standing before her and asking her what she wanted. Yet, she couldn\u2019t come up with anything and remained silent. Huo Yuting was not so patient as to wait for her to think of something.\u201cA leading role.\u201dHe thought that since this woman was an actress, her greatest desire would be to become famous.However, she shook her head.Filming was too much work.\u201cI\u2019ll just take cash,\u201d she said straightforwardly.Huo Yuting was not surprised, but for some reason, he found this act of negotiation amusing.He, the great President Huo, was paying to sleep with a woman.Meanwhile, Ruan Jiaojiao paid no attention to what he might be thinking. The original host had really been quite poor. Although she was in the entertainment circle, she was not popular and didn\u2019t have a gold master, so she was just barely scraping by. Moreover, she recently got caught in a scandal. The main reason Ruan Jiaojiao stayed with the crew was so she could sponge meals off them.When her thoughts reached this point, she walked to Huo Yuting and stretched out her palm.\u201cGive me money and I\u2019ll sleep with you, or I\u2019ll go find another man.\u201dHe stared at her outstretched hand. It was beautiful and slender, pale and soft. He couldn\u2019t help but remember how it had stroked and played with his member that night.As soon as the image entered his mind, he grabbed her hand, intertwined their fingers, and pulled her into his arms.\u2018Is this a yes?\u2019She had no time to react before her body was lifted and thrown onto the bed. The man looked down at her with a burning gaze. His eyes were filled with undisguised lust, contempt, and disgust.It was a complex and contradictory mix of emotions, but when Ruan Jiaojiao saw it, she thought that it made him seem somewhat cute and pure. In any case, he had given her his first time, so she should at least shoulder the responsibility and teach him the ways of the bedroom. Moreover, he was going to pay her for it!Having made up her mind, she wound her snowy arms around his neck, her eyes bright and clear like morning dew.Such a tender little beauty was lying obediently under him, allowing him to do whatever he wanted with her. Huo Yuting\u2019s heart softened, but it hardened again as soon as he remembered that this was a money transaction.Then, as if to vent his anger, he forcefully tugged on the tie of her bathrobe. Unfortunately, his hastiness only made the knot tighter.\u201cYou\u2019re so clumsy. Lie down and let me do it myself!\u201dAt this point, Ruan Jiaojiao considered herself an old veteran. Seeing Huo Yuting like this, she sat up and pushed him down. In this reverse position, her body was looming over his. Huo Yuting watched as her fingers grasped the knot and easily unraveled it. Then, under his hot gaze, she slid the soft fabric off her shoulders.The sight of her tantalizing body, naked save for the bathrobe around her shoulders, made his eyes darken further.Ruan Jiaojiao leaned in, lifted her buttocks, and sat down on his lap. She straddled him and reached out to unbutton his shirt, but he stopped her by grabbing her wrist. She was startled, but not surprised. Instead of forcing it, she changed trajectories and reached for his belt. This time, he didn\u2019t stop her.The conspicuous tent in his pants made her grin from ear to ear. She reached out and palmed it.\u201cBe good, let this big sister love you\u2026\u201d\u2018Oh, sh*t.\u2019As soon as she blurted out these words, she remembered that the man under her was Huo Yuting, not Shen Muyan. She hurriedly took a peek at his expression. Fortunately, whether it was because he didn\u2019t hear her or that he simply didn\u2019t care, he didn\u2019t seem to be displeased. In order to cover up her slip of the tongue, she quickly released his shaft and leaned back.When she looked at his size from a moderate distance, she swallowed her saliva and felt her mouth go dry. She couldn\u2019t help but stick out her pink tongue and lick her lower lip, but the more she licked, the dryer it became.Seeing her nervous expression, Huo Yuting felt inexplicably pleased.\u201cWhy did you stop?\u201dHearing his ridicule, she promptly reached for his zipper and freed his shaft from its confines. Her impression of it was very vague. After all, when she transmigrated, she had been penetrated as soon as she opened her eyes.Thinking about it in retrospect, her body was still dry when he entered her, and she\u2019d felt some pain after the event. Something, a tissue or maybe even her hymen, had probably been torn by him.\u201cWait.\u201dShe shifted and tried to get off his body so she could check the hotel room for lubricants and whatnot. But how could he let her escape? Grasping her ankle, he pulled her back with ease.\u201cOh\u2026 I said wait, don\u2019t\u2026\u201dBut he couldn\u2019t wait any longer, and the more she resisted, the more excited he became. It seemed that only by tormenting and ravaging this shameless and money-hungry woman would he be able to relieve the resentment in his heart.He lifted one of her legs and gripped his cock. Then, he positioned himself at her entrance and pushed inside in one unceremonious motion.As soon as her walls enveloped him, he frowned. Her body was too tight, and too dry. The lack of lubrication hindered his advancement, and the tightness was a little uncomfortable. Despite that, he was reluctant to pull out and stubbornly stayed inside her body.When Ruan Jiaojiao felt him grab her and ram his length directly inside without arousing her or even applying lubrication, she immediately flinched and hissed in pain.\u201cF*ck, you son of a b*tch!\u201d she cursed. Her sudden outburst stupefied him, but two seconds later, his surprise turned into anger. Widening her legs, he forced himself deeper, intending to punish her!\u201cThis is rape, you f*cking assh*le!\u201d she erupted immediately, then without holding back, she raised her hand and delivered a sharp, sound slap across his face.The man was first caught off guard by her rage, then when the slap landed on his cheek, his entire body froze. She immediately pushed him away and glared at him.\u201cD*mn it, you noob! Did you seriously think that was okay? I don\u2019t want your money anymore, just get out of my sight!\u201d she snapped, impatiently tugging the bathrobe on to cover her body again. Then, she tied the robe belt and got off the bed. She entered the bathroom to change, slamming the door behind her.\u2018F*ck being his teacher, I quit! The female lead can take this job!\u2019Seeing her enraged like this, Huo Yuting felt stifled, and\u2026 a little regretful. Judging from her reaction, he had been too impatient. Did he really hurt her? She even said she didn\u2019t want the money anymore and unreservedly cursed at him.He lowered his eyes. All of a sudden, the domineering president was reduced to an embarrassed and anxious man.\u2018Should I apologize?\u2019\u2018No! Why should I apologize to her? She drugged me\u2026\u2019But that was one thing and this was another. It seemed like he was the one at fault this time\u2026 maybe.Meanwhile, inside the bathroom, Ruan Jiaojiao had already drawn a big fat \u2018X\u2019 on Huo Yuting in her mind.\u2018What\u2019s the use of having a big c*ck if the man is an assh*le? Negative review!!\u2019\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dShe was just about to put on her bra when he burst into the bathroom and blurted those words, effectively rendering her speechless. Since he was the male lead, she\u2019d expected him to at least have a sense of propriety, so she didn\u2019t lock the door behind her when she entered the bathroom to change.Meanwhile, Huo Yuting had not expected to see a scenery like this after barging in\u2026The woman\u2019s bathrobe was lying messily on top of the toilet seat. She was holding a bra in front of her, and the only thing covering her nakedness was a pair of skimpy panties that left little to imagination. It was a splendid, naked spring scenery\u2026Truthfully, he was more shocked than she was. He tried to move his gaze away from her body, but the next thing he knew, he was attracted by the black lace bra in her hands and found himself unable to look away from it.Ruan Jiaojiao soon regained her composure. Ignoring the man\u2019s stare, she put her arms through the bra straps and bent down slightly, then she moved her hands under her chest and stuck her fingers under the bra cups to adjust them for a more comfortable fit.Huo Yuting felt hot. Very, very hot. The bathroom still contained some of the water vapor from her shower earlier, and the fragrance of the body wash she had used lingered in the air.Countless images filled his mind: Her bare body on his lap, straddling him. Her bathrobe, unraveling to reveal a nosebleed-worthy visage.Her fingers, touching her chest\u2026 her chest\u2026Her soft, plump mounds with their attractive pink tips\u2026 just the thought of them made him hard.At this point, he had no choice but to accept the facts. He genuinely wanted this woman. Not for the sake of his self-esteem or revenge, but for his own physiological desires. He just wanted to have sex with her.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t do it on purpose. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d After he\u2019d thought it out, his second apology was more sincere than the first one.Ruan Jiaojiao was in the middle of hooking her bra when she heard his words. Her lips immediately curved up into a playful smile. Releasing the hook strap, she moved closer to him and turned around, showing him her back.\u201cGive me a hand,\u201d she smirked, looking at him over her shoulder.Huo Yuting was stunned again for the nth time that night as he stared at her attractive back view. Her black lace bra was hanging loosely from her chest, unhooked, and the thin fabric of her matching panties was squeezed between her two perfect buttocks, teasing and tempting him to spread them apart and push a finger inside her hidden entrance.He could imagine himself gripping her full, curvaceous hips as he pounded into her sensual body from behind\u2026\u2018This cheeky, dissolute woman! D*mned vixen!\u2019 he thought, but he had already submitted to his desires.Lifting a hand, he slapped her round buttocks and admired the slight, quivering bounce it gave in return. His other hand reached around her front and pinched a tip through her bra.Then, leaning down, he buried his face in her neck and took a deep breath, reveling in the fragrance of her body wash and the natural scent of her body. It was like an aphrodisiac, causing his member to swell to a painful degree and lust to cloud his mind.\u201cI\u2019ll listen to you this time. I\u2019ll slow down and be gentle when you tell me to, okay?\u201dHuo Yuting himself did not realize how utterly compliant his tone had become, but Ruan Jiaojiao did.He was begging her: Please don\u2019t go. Give it to me.Her smile deepened. She turned around, revealing her amused expression, the slight arch of an eyebrow, and wrapped her arms around his neck.\u201cOkay~\u201dT/N: This chapter is literally 3x longer than the average\u2026 welp.Anyways, you go girl!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15 \u2013 Too Good (HH)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayRuan Jiaojiao showed a smug expression that made Huo Yuting\u2019s eyes darken when he saw it.\u2018This sly woman! Was she exaggerating just now? Playing hard to get?\u2019However, he was in no state to be worrying about her cunningness. How could he when her warm body was enveloped in his arms and her soft mounds and round buttocks were gripped in his hands? He had never felt so impatient and reckless before.It took only one slip of his finger to pull away the tiny piece of cloth covering her entrance. His lips and tongue glid hungrily down her bare back as his large palms stroked and rubbed her smooth skin.\u201cJiaojiao\u2026 I want to be inside you\u2026 \u201cHis hot breath fanned across her neck, the place she was most sensitive nub, causing her body to melt from the stimulation. Slick juices began to seep from her entrance, and her walls felt empty. She wanted him to fill her up already, and the timbre of his deep voice in her ear only drove her crazier with need.Without bothering to put on airs, she quickly hugged his neck and wrapped her legs around his waist.\u201cHere or in bed?\u201dHuo Yuting could feel her warm mounds through his shirt and her perky tips rubbing against the fabric. When has he ever experienced such a beautiful situation? He gripped her buttocks tightly, bringing his palm flush against her skin.&amp;nbsp;He almost couldn\u2019t control the desire to take her right against the cold wall, but he endured it and carried her out of the bathroom without saying another word.They tumbled onto the bed together. This time, he took the initiative to unbutton his shirt and hastily removed the rest of his clothes. Ruan Jiaojiao smiled like a flower, enjoying the strip the male lead was putting on for her.\u2018Ohh\u2026 that\u2019s a nice body.\u2019Huo Yuting\u2019s physique fell between Qin Rui\u2019s and Shen Muyan\u2019s. He didn\u2019t have the former\u2019s crazy bulging muscles, nor the latter\u2019s untrained leanness. His body was strong and mature with just the right amount of muscles from regular exercise.She brought her index finger to her lips and ran her tongue over the tip before drawing it inside her mouth and giving it a little bite to suppress her impatience.Pleased by the look in her eyes, Huo Yuting took her finger and slid it from her mouth, then he leaned down and pressed his lips against hers. He sucked on her soft lips before thrusting his wet, greedy tongue inside.Ruan Jiaojiao was momentarily dumbfounded.\u2018He\u2019s kissing me? We\u2019re just going to have sex, so why is he kissing me?\u2019Her eyebrows furrowed in confusion, but she let him suck on her tongue and bite her lips. The man was inexperienced, so when he was finally satisfied and released her, her mouth was left with a numb, stinging sensation.He shifted his position and moved down her neck and collarbones to her chest and abdomen. Along the way, he greedily licked and sucked on her skin as if he wanted to leave marks on her entire body.\u2018This is killing me\u2026\u2019Ruan Jiaojiao didn\u2019t want to continue with the foreplay any longer, so she buried her fingers in his dark hair and clamped her legs around his head. Suddenly, she felt a hot, wet tongue lap at her sensitive clit until a sudden shiver ran up her spine.Huo Yuting raised his head. His eyes were dark and shining, his thin lips slick with her juices.\u201cIt\u2019s wet now, can I go in?\u201d\u201cStick it in\u2026 hurry\u2026\u201d she responded with a tremor in her voice, still stunned from the stimulation of his tongue.It was just too surprising. How did the male lead suddenly become so impressive? Did he switch souls like she did and was taken over by an old veteran?Meanwhile, the man in question was observing her expression. From her reaction, he could tell that he had done it. He was capable of making this woman feel better than that other man did!He gripped his shaft and positioned it at her dripping entrance. His waist moved forward, and he sunk inside. As expected, her walls were already wet and slippery with her juices.This time, he was able to go in without much hindrance; nonetheless, he stopped when he was halfway in and parted her legs before slowly pushing in deeper.Inch by inch\u2026They could both feel the delicious friction of his member sliding against her walls. Breathless gasps fell from their lips at the same time.When Huo Yuting was almost entirely inside, he paused and then without warning, he suddenly rammed in with one hard thrust that reached all the way to her cervix.\u201cAhh!\u201d\u2018It\u2019s so deep, so thick\u2026!\u2019The man held onto her waist and began a rhythmic tempo of deep and shallow thrusts, pulling out all the way, thrusting in halfway, then slamming to the hilt. Ruan Jiaojiao felt like a sailboat lost at sea when a towering wave came and crashed over her, causing her walls to twitch and spasm from the impact.Her back arched off the bed and she desperately grabbed onto his strong arms, her nails digging into his skin. Her toes curled tightly, and it wasn\u2019t until several seconds later that her entire body relaxed again.Huo Yuting knew that she had reached a climax, but he refused to let her go so soon. He turned her body to the side and pulled out his still-hard member. After taking a moment to admire the wetness that dripped from her entrance, he lifted one of her legs and placed it on his shoulder. Then he was inside of her again, buried to the hilt.The intense climax had left Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s body soft and sensitive. She couldn\u2019t even muster the strength to move her fingers. She was like a fish pulled ashore, panting breathlessly as she let Huo Yuting continue f*cking her.When another climax crashed over her, he released her leg and slid a hand under her body and pulled her against his chest. She felt him finish inside of her, pumping her full with his seed. His hands rested on her waist.\u201cYou came?\u201dHuo Yuting\u2019s proud voice sounded in her ears, just like a child asking for praise. Ruan Jiaojiao almost laughed at his childishness.\u2018What\u2019s the matter with the male lead?\u2019Still, she suppressed her laughter and rested her chin on his shoulder. She blew in his ear and agreed, \u201cMhm, it felt very good. You\u2019re awesome, Mr. Huo.\u201dThose words satisfied him, though for some reason, they sounded a little\u2026 off?Before he could figure out why, Ruan Jiaojiao leaned back in his lap and pushed his face into her chest.\u201cIt felt so good. One more time.\u201dShe cupped his cheeks and raised his face, then she leaned down and gave him a little kiss to express her approval. Her wet tongue darted his lips before retreating. With the help of the bare skin-to-skin contact between their bodies, it didn\u2019t take long for Huo Yuting to get hard again.Ruan Jiaojiao was very satisfied with the male lead\u2019s excellent stamina this time. She parted her legs and lined up his member before taking it inside her.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dAs he slowly stretched her walls, she hugged his neck and closed her eyes, her lips parting slightly to express her pleasure. She was like a small, greedy animal that didn\u2019t know when to be satisfied.Huo Yuting\u2019s eyes were as dark as ink. He held onto her squirming body as it swallowed his length. The image in front of him is absolutely obscene. When he closed his eyes and opened them again, Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s face seemed to look more beautiful and seductive than before. He thought that if she wanted his soul, he would gladly give it to her\u2026\u201cAh\u2026\u201dHe suddenly pushed her down, regaining the dominant position. His grip tightened on her waist, and without warning, his thrusts became faster and harder. He rammed against her cervix each time and filled the room with obscene wet sounds as his balls slapped against her bottom, so quick and rough that her skin began to turn pink.\u201cAhh\u2026 too much\u2026 slow down, I\u2019m\u2026 coming\u2026!\u201dPleasured cries spilled uncontrollably from her lips, and a third climax overtook her, this one so intense that her mind blanked, and she nearly blacked out.T/N: The Domineering CEO has been tamed.

As expected of the domineering president character; the four-digit sum in her bank account had turned into an eight-digit sum.Even an A-list actress would find it extravagant. The male lead was also attractive both face and body-wise. It was a total bargain no matter how she looked at it.Satisfied and content, she walked into the bustling streets. Compared to the passerby rushing about, she was leisurely and \u201crich\u201d enough now to visit the shopping mall and buy, buy, buy.Suddenly, she stopped outside of a fast-food restaurant and stared through the glass window at the family having a meal inside.It was a warm but ordinary family of three. The child was about three or four years old, with a chubby, babyish face, and two pigtails at either side of her head.Before the System could ask what she was doing, she had already put on a pair of sunglasses and walked away as if nothing had happened.System: Host, are you missing your family?It remembered the look in her eyes just now.Ruan Jiaojiao smiled.\u2018No. I just remembered what the mission is, that\u2019s all.\u201dThe System knew it should feel happy and congratulate its host for remembering the mission, but for some reason, it felt a little disappointed instead?Anyway, the mission was very simple and common. Before she died, the original host had felt extremely guilty and regretful toward her parents.&amp;nbsp;Her vanity had led her astray and ruined her life, and the two people she was most afraid of implicating were her parents. Their daughter, the apple of their eye, had not only become infamous and cursed by the public but also committed suicide and was even trampled upon by the keyboard warriors after her death. One could only imagine the old couple\u2019s grief.Thus, Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s mission was to leave the entertainment circle with a clean reputation and shower her parents with filial piety.&amp;nbsp;So far, Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s mission progress was at zero. After all, she had done nothing except sleep with the three male leads since she arrived in this world. Knowing this, she only had one idea in her mind.If she had remembered the mission sooner, she would\u2019ve treated the male lead better before leaving his bed. Would it be too late to go back and cajole him now?The System gloated at her regret.That night, Huo Yuting had internally struggled for a while before solemnly asking her to cut off contact with other men. Ruan Jiaojiao had refused and given him a \u201cWho do you think you are? I\u2019ll do what I want, don\u2019t think you can control me after sleeping with me twice\u201d attitude.When she finally ran out of patience, she\u2019d dropped a single \u201cDon\u2019t forget to pay\u201d before patting her bottom and leaving. The System recalled Huo Yuting\u2019s gloomy expression and couldn\u2019t help but shudder. Its host was really too arrogant and fearless in front of the male lead.Ruan Jiaojiao felt her head throb at the thought of having to fix her reputation. She had no choice but to do it, but she had just offended the male lead and accepted his money. Not expecting this, her original plan was to stay away from the male and female lead as soon as she received the money as to avoid bringing further trouble upon herself.She was not afraid of being called shameless. What she was afraid of was offending the male lead further and making a fool of herself for nothing. Due to this dilemma, she felt truly powerless for the first time since she entered this world.To her surprise, the situation worsened in the following days, which didn\u2019t help at all.Some tabloid suddenly exposed her for having an affair with Shen Muyan, one of the rising stars in the industry. To the ordinary actress, this would be nothing but small gossip. But to her, it was a blatant accusation of prostitution!When Shen Muyan\u2019s agency saw the reputation of their most important cash cow being threatened, they immediately pulled out the big guns and pushed Ruan Jiaojiao out to take all the blame. They even wished they could throw her into the mud and stomp on her for implicating Shen Muyan!It took no time for her to be labeled as a loose woman who deliberately seduced the popular new actor and colluded with the tabloid to hype herself.Needless to say, Shen Muyan\u2019s fans were furious. They cursed her for being brain damaged and shameless enough to extend her evil, filthy claws to their pure male god. Did she think she was worthy? Because she wasn\u2019t!!So the overwhelming malice and curse came to Ruan Jiaojiao.Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s popularity shot up like a rocket and her reputation had never been so terrible. And in the face of this accident, she was a little confused.\u2014T/N: Sorry for the sudden MIA T_T I wanted to come back with a mass release, which proved to be impossible with my irl schedule.

Moreover, she had a boyfriend and was considering marriage with him. After this matter subsided, she was ready to quit the entertainment circle.Though they allowed it, Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s parents never liked seeing their daughter be a part of the messy entertainment circle. Therefore, they were very relieved when they heard her soothing words.They didn\u2019t use the Internet, so they were oblivious to the malicious comments the netizens were writing about her. Once they were abroad, they would be away from their gossipy neighbors too.After seeing the old couple off, she sighed in relief. Just then, her phone rang with a call from Shen Muyan.\u201cJiaojiao, let\u2019s meet.\u201dSpeaking of Shen Muyan, their scandal was officially in full swing, but the parties in question hadn\u2019t seen each other since her character died. She agreed to meet him, and before long, she arrived at the address he sent her. It was his apartment.Decked in a complete disguise with a loose black men\u2019s shirt, baggy jeans, a baseball cap, and a mask, her curvaceous figure was nowhere to be seen. At first glance, she looked just like a little errand boy or assistant.She lifted her hand and pressed the doorbell. When Shen Muyan opened the door, he stood motionless in the doorway and stared at her in confusion. She pulled off the mask and smiled.\u201cWhat, do you not recognize me anymore? All I did was change clothes, you know.\u201dShe was clearly the same glamorous and beautiful woman as he last saw her, but the neutral outfit gave her a whole different look and feel. He felt his face heat up as his heart began to race. He was convinced that she would look attractive and sexy in anything she wore.After stepping inside, she stopped and looked around. The simple yet comfortable suite had been arranged for him by his agency. Shen Muyan was usually busy with work, and there were only a few things in the entire apartment. It seemed that he didn\u2019t live here often.As Ruan Jiaojiao observed the apartment, Shen Muyan was staring at her back, as if he could see the delicate and seductive body wrapped in her loose attire. She thought that he would question her, or at least say something, anything, but he kept silent.She turned her head and was just about to ask him what he called her for when he suddenly drew close and hugged her waist from the back.\u201cJiaojiao\u2026\u201d His voice was inexplicably low and seemed to contain a lot of emotions.\u201cCall me jiejie,\u201d she teased, but instead of playing along, he spun her around and made her face him.The baseball cap on her head fell to the floor. She was stunned. Frowning, she patted his arm, indicating that he let her go, but the young man was unexpectedly stubborn. His arms tightened around her.\u201cMy hair is all messed up. Wait a minute.\u201dShe tried to free herself from his embrace so she could fix her hair, but he didn\u2019t let her. He gripped her waist and suddenly pulled her body down, then he kissed her.\u201cMy heart is all messed up. I can\u2019t wait!\u201dT/N: So I found this Japanese voice roleplay ASMR channel in my YT recommendations one day, and the SMY vibes\u2026 https://youtu.be/xcKuW2dOWHsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 18": "Chapter 18 Mu Yan, it\u2019s too deep (H)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayMu Yan pushed Ruan Jiaojiao down on the floor, looking like a beast who had just been released from his cage, and they both urgently tore at each other\u2019s clothes.He lifted her shirt up and eagerly pulled down her bra, revealing two perfectly round white mounds that undulated along her breathing, drawing a soul-sucking arc.Shen Muyan looked at her infatuatedly as he pressed his slightly cold lips on her full mounds. His delicate face stuck close to her skin, rubbing against it with fondness and inexplicable sorrow.What a h*rny little beast.Ruan Jiaojiao felt desire arising from his caresses and without saying another word, she pushed him down and climbed on top of him. With a tug of her hands, Shen Muyan\u2019s shirt and buttons were ripped off, dropping down on the floor and producing clear, crisp sounds.Shen Muyan was stunned by her boldness before immediately smiling in response, revealing pure white teeth, his smile bright and clear.Raising a brow, the tip of her charming eyes narrowed, her eyes were like that of spring water, melting his soul into it.Ruan Jiaojiao skillfully undid Shen Muyan\u2019s trousers, her soft fingers fondling and rubbing his tender meat stick.\u201cHave you done it with any other woman?\u201dLiu Luoxue\u2019s pretty little face resurfaced in her mind.Shen Muyan shook his head before soon recalling something and his gaze turned vicious, even suffused with glistening tears.\u2018Bang,\u2019 Ruan Jiaojiao was once again pushed down by Shen Muyan, the back of her head hitting the ground. Surprised by the sound, Shen Muyan quickly held her head and rubbed it.\u201cJiaojiao, does it hurt? I\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d He quickly apologized remorsefully.\u201cThen why did you push me?\u201d Ruan Jiaojiao was speechless.\u201cWho told you\u2026to\u2026.on that day\u2026\u201dShen Muyan\u2019s pretty eyes turned misty with ripples forming on it, his pupils looking clear and limpid. The sight of it rendered Jiaojiao entranced.She slowly realized that the last time they had a quarrel, she took advantage of the situation to have a falling out with him and used Qin Rui to get rid of Shen Muyan.Ugh..Since it felt as though her debauchery was completely exposed in Shen Muyan\u2019s eyes, there was nothing more she could hide.\u201cThat\u2019s right. I slept with Qin Rui. He was drugged that day and had knocked on my door\u2026mmmhhh\u2026\u201dRuan Jiaojiao had yet to have finished speaking when her lips were muffled by Shen Muyan.\u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to speak!\u201dRuan Jiaojiao secretly laughed to herself. Today was a pleasant surprise, seeing Shen Muyan put on a stubborn expression of refusing to listen.She shut her mouth as Shen Muyan looked at her with incomparable bitterness, as though he was denouncing her for being a heartless traitor.\u201cYou said you liked me.\u201dRuan Jiaojiao nodded. That\u2019s right.Shen Muyan\u2019s eyes glinted in excitement before quickly dimming down once again.Ruan Jiaojiao looked like she was bullying Shen Muyan and had wanted to say something before stopping herself.\u201cWhat did you want to say?\u201d Shen Muyan spoke on her behalf, breaking the air of awkwardness.\u201cUm\u2026Are we still continuing?\u201dShe wasn\u2019t interested in holding a conversation.Shen Muyan was stunned. He saw that Ruan Jiaojiao looked calm without the slightest twinge of guilt and instead, looked slightly impatient.He suddenly realized that, what this woman liked, was his own physical body, not what he was thinking about nor what he cared about.A wave of acridness washed over Shen Muyan. That\u2019s right. What had sparked between them was lust and not love.Every time they met, they would always automatically take off their clothes and roll in the sheets. He had also never asked her about anything before and she had never mentioned anything about dating or responsibilities.So what right did he have to rebuke her for having relations with other men?Ruan Jiaojiao saw that Shen Muyan was silent, hence, she started tidying her clothes and retracted all thoughts of having s*x. Since the other part was not willing, she wouldn\u2019t insist on it.\u201cWhy did you call me over?\u201d She adopted a proper professional attitude.In the blink of an eye, the two had gone from sharing a bed to solemnly negotiating.Shen Muyan hung his eyes down, his fingers clenched into fists.With a \u2018bang\u2019, Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s head once again hit the floor, but this time, Shen Muyan pursed his lips, looking like a vicious little wolf. He tore her pants off, revealing the girl\u2019s long white beautiful legs. Shen Muyan\u2019s eyes turned dark upon laying eyes on it, glinting with the flame of lust.Parting her legs, he pulled her panties off and faced her flower seams, he pressed against it, inserting his meat stick inside.Ruan Jiaojiao shut her eyes. His stiff hard object forced her tight hole to open and before the entire root could be pushed to the depths, her cave instantly felt filled to the brim, the sour and numbing pleasure instantly hit her, causing her to moan out loud.Before she could even carefully reflect, Shen Muyan had changed from his previous gentleness and consideration and without any foreplay, he started fiercely thrusting into her without hesitation nor halting.Just like a hungry wolf charging forward, greedily tasting her body.Ruan Jiaojiao couldn\u2019t be bothered to speak and didn\u2019t have to think. Swallowed by the turbulent waves of lust, she was simply done to heaven, leaping high up before dropping down. Her sweet and soft voice made his rod swell even more, as he pounded her until her juices splattered everywhere.\u201cMuyan\u2026.Muyan\u2026\u201dRuan Jiaojiao looked at Shen Muyan\u2019s innocent face, his gaze ruthless as his c**k pumped into her even more fiercely, wreaking havoc in her hole recklessly. A burst of shiver hit her, making her cl*max and leak out a stream of water.Because she had worn a loose hoodie today, the hem of which reached past her derriere, the water leaking out of her hole had dampened her clothes, making her bottom feel sticky. However, Shen Muyan only continued to pound her, causing more water to be squeezed out of her noisily.\u201cSister, you\u2019re leaking so much water\u2026\u201dShen Muyan inserted his fingers into the place the two were joined at, his palm groping her firm butt. Feeling the wetness in his hand, his youthful and beautiful face, was now inexplicable dyed with an malevolent air, looking incomparably gorgeous and brimming with s*x.And being the bold animal that Ruan Jiaojiao was, she immediately responded.\u201cThat\u2019s because little brother is amazing, f**king sister so good.\u201d <sup>1</sup> The previous translator used jiejie for sister but I figured it would be easier for people to remember the english counterpart. Also, this does not mean that they are biological siblings, sometimes, people call friends as brother or sister as a way to sound affectionate.Shen Muyan raised the corner of his lips. What a truly shameless woman. He drew back, pulling out his c**k out before bending his waist and plunging in strongly, eliciting a cry out of her lips.\u201cMuyan, it\u2019s too deep\u2026\u201dShen Muyan bent down, turning over her clothes. Her black shirt contrasted against her fair white skin, making it striking to the eye and a delicate fragrance wafted out of the girl\u2019s body.At times, he would dream. He would dream of the captivating scent on her body, the soft sensation of her skin, the sweet feeling of her hole and once his er*tic dream has come to an end, he would wake up and realize that he hadn\u2019t seen her for a long time.Shen Muyan felt that the time they spent together back when they were crewmates seemed like an er*tic dream because once he woke up, it disappeared without a trace. This woman seduced him into having the most inexplicable and mindblowing s*x yet he had ever had yet she was also able to simply and cruelly put an end to their relationship as though she no longer wanted to have any relations with him from now on.That was why he felt vexed. And in reality, he was the one who had deliberately leaked news to the gossip media in hopes that she would take the initiative to come find him and through a bout of shocking scandals, the two would be forcibly tied together.If she was willing, he even wanted to publicly announce their relationship and help her wash away those dirty rumors and break off all the relationships she had with other men.Shen Muyan thought too beautifully but his efforts were still dashed.Because she didn\u2019t care at all.How infuriating!!Shen Muyan\u2019s anger rose the more he thought about this. Using his white teeth, he nipped Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s soft chest but he couldn\u2019t stand using too much force and so, it eventually turned to licking and sucking. Ruan Jiaojiao let out a whimper from the feeling of him sucking her t*t, waves of desire once again washing over her. She wrapped her arms around Shen Muyan\u2019s neck and clamped her legs around his waist, bearing the wolfdog\u2019s fierce and violent thrusts as each and every one of her pores screamed in pleasure.\u201cMuyan, I really like you\u2026\u201d Engulfed in the moment, Ruan Jiaojiao couldn\u2019t help herself from exclaiming.Words of endearment naturally flowed out of her lips in bed.Mindless words could cause offense. Shen Muyan heard her spit out these words whilst he was positioned in between her legs and his body stiffened. His arms wrapped tightly around her as his waist slammed even more ruthlessly into her cave, pounding Ruan Jiaojiao so good that she couldn\u2019t help but speak more words of endearment.\u201cMuyan\u2026 Ahnnn.. Muyan I love you\u2026Haaah\u2026.fasterrr.. I\u2019m going to comee\u2026 Ahhhhh\u2026.\u201dRuan Jiaojiao heaved a long sigh of satisfaction as she once again reached the peak of desire before her body turned limp. The two people\u2019s bodies were intertwined and Shen Muyan\u2019s meat stick was still buried in her body without any signs of pulling out, but this time, the two people had reached cl*max together so they were tightly wrapped around each other, feeling the calming of the tide, the air suffused with unprecedented affection.\u201cJiao Jiao, are you telling the truth?\u201d Shen Muyan\u2019s voice carried a twinge of darkness.\u201cI don\u2019t lie.\u201dRuan Jiaojiao was in an extremely good mood. She combed her fingers through the man\u2019s soft hair and gently caressed it.Did this mean that she really likes him? She likes him more than any other man?Shen Muyan lifted his head, his gaze burning brightly as he sincerely kissed her on the lips. Ruan Jiaojiao parted her lips, allowing his tongue to slip in and coiled her tongue around it, the two sharing a particularly passionate kiss.The system couldn\u2019t help but sigh, \u201cHow scummy.\u201dT/N: If you\u2019re curious about my personal favorite in this arc, my brain says Qin Rui but my body says Muyan.

    "Chapter 19": "Chapter 19 PromiscuityPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayRuan Jiaojiao languidly laid on the bed, narrowing her eyes and donning a face of satisfaction.Shen Muyan looked at her incomparably gorgeous appearance. He only felt his heart swell with love, begrudging that he couldn\u2019t assimilate into the blood and flesh of this beautiful piece of meat, trapping her tightly beside him with nowhere else to go and forbidding any other man to touch her, making her his forever.The youth\u2019s train of complicated and muddled thoughts were interrupted however, when Ruan Jiaojiao lifted her legs up and hooked them around Shen Muyan\u2019s long legs, using her foot to stroke his thighs in an erotically naughty and teasing manner.In an instant, Shen Muyan turned her over, pressing her down and his once again hardened member eyed her covetously, pressing against her flower seams. With just a few inches left in distance, he\u2019d be able to enter her sopping wet seventh heaven.\u201cUnnnn\u2026 I surrender\u2026.I was wrong\u2026.\u201dRuan Jiaojiao didn\u2019t have the strength to go for another round and immediately mewled for mercy, retreating slightly as she implored, to pull the distance between them farther.\u201cMuyan, sister is tired, come and massage me.\u201dShe sighed and pulled Muyan\u2019s fingers towards her back, motioning for him to give her a rub.Realizing that Ruan Jiaojiao really did look tired and recalling the \u2018fierce battle\u2019 they had just been engaged in, Shen Muyan\u2019s heart softened and his hands automatically began to help alleviate her soreness.When his palm and fingertips touched Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s satiny skin, Shen Muyan once again felt his desire surge. The youth\u2019s lust had always been particularly strong, his stamina was bottomless, as though he could never ever tire.Ruan Jiaojiao could feel a hot and hard object poking her in the rear and immediately quivered in response. Originally, she became drowsy from the comfort of being massaged. She immediately leapt off the bed nimbly, leaving behind a sentence.\u201cI\u2019m going to take a shower.\u201dAfter washing up and changing her clothes, Ruan Jiaojiao tiptoed and cupped Shen Muyan\u2019s face, unable to help but put on a smitten look.Ahhh, he\u2019s really handsome, like a little fresh meat that she couldn\u2019t part with.Ruan Jiaojiao planted a kiss on Shen Muyan\u2019s lips and because the two people\u2019s heights differed greatly, she was unable to reach him so instead, she hooked her arm around Shen Muyan\u2019s neck, forcing him to bend down as she ruffled his soft hair.\u201cMuyan is such a good boy. Sister is going first then. I\u2019ll come find you next time.\u201dAfter she finished, Ruan Jiaojiao picked up her baseball cap and went out. She looked refreshed, cheerful and content, the vestiges of fatigue she had on earlier were nowhere to be found.The door shut gently with a \u2018click\u2019 in front of Shen Muyan. Seeing her leave without hesitation after eating him cleanly, Shen Muyan\u2019s heart was filled with both love and hatred, his expression twisting constantly, looking extremely conflicted.\u2727\uff65\uff9f: \u2727\uff65\uff9f: :\uff65\uff9f\u2727 :\uff65\uff9f\u2727\uff65\uff9f: \u2727\uff65\uff9f: :\uff65\uff9f\u2727 :\uff65\uff9f\u2727Looking at the sight of perfumed clothes and gorgeous hair at this drinking party in front of her, Ruan Jiaojiao lifted her wine cup up to down the remaining content.She didn\u2019t know what the male lead was thinking, suddenly inviting her to participate in the reception.There were several people from the entertainment circle attending this banquet, including directors, producers, and entertainment media.Ruan Jiaojiao was wearing a red fishtail dress that outlined her enchanting waist, her snow white legs occasionally peeked out every time her dress fluttered, and the v-neck design emphasized her plump bunnies.She was like a pomegranate flower in full bloom. Even if she was only standing in an inconspicuous corner, wearing a bored and indifferent look, she still managed to attract the gazes of several lusty men, who inquired about her identity in private.Upon hearing that she was the infamous third-rate actress who had just been involved in a recent s*x scandal, the men\u2019s gazes had turned into those of desire to conquer as well as contempt. They continued to inquire about her current benefactor and see whether there was any opportunity to get on intimate terms with her.Huo Yuting took the sight of the men\u2019s lusty and lecherous gazes into his eyes. He was originally prepared to ignore this woman to deliberately embarrass her but was now walking towards Ruan Jiaojiao with a gloomy expression.Ruan Jiaojiao watched as Huo Yuting approached her with an unkind expression. The male lead\u2019s domineering side was leaking out, provoking her instinct to flee for survival. She unconsciously wanted to retreat but before she could do so, he had seized her wrist.\u201cWh-\u2026What do you want?\u201d Recalling the last time she had gotten him furious and had suffered, Ruan Jiaojiao felt a little uneasy.They were currently in broad daylight. Why did the male lead look like he was itching to eat her?When the perverts who were secretly eyeing Ruan Jiaojiao, saw that Huo Yuting had appeared, they immediately became speechless, and decided to change their minds.That\u2019s not right. Since her backer was Huo Yuting, how did she garner such a dirty reputation?When Huo Yuting pulled Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s hand, she swept a look at the crowd\u2019s sinister gaze and was suddenly struck with an idea, immediately revealing a delighted and excited expression. She spontaneously held Huo Yuting\u2019s arm and adopted an intimate attitude, calling out sweetly.\u201cBaby\u2026\u201dHuo Yuting, \u201c\u2026.\u201dWhy did this woman suddenly turn h*rny?\u201cDon\u2019t be angry with me anymore. I was wrong before.\u201d Ruan Jiaojiao continued, wrapping her arms around Huo Yuting\u2019s and rubbing her round fullness against them.Huo Yuting\u2019s anger simmered down at this but his lust only surged. His pupils became dark as he cast a long meaningful glance at her.\u201cNo matter what you\u2019re planning to do, the money has already been transferred to you, so tonight, you are mine.\u201dRuan Jiaojiao was stunned for a moment before quickly reacting back, using an odd look to measure Huo Yuting.Tsk tsk, why did the male lead\u2019s character suddenly turn so vulgar?He was openly conducting an exchange of money for physical contact.Immediately, Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s eyes curved into crescent shapes, her bright, alluring lips hooking up into a cheerful arc.So straightforward?She liked it!Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s scarlet painted fingernails streaked across Huo Yuting\u2019s white ironed shirt, caressing his tight pecs through the fabric.\u201cAlright, President Huo, tonight, I\u2019ll accompany you.\u201dHearing her delighted response, Huo Yuting\u2019s thin lips pursed into a straight line, feeling not at all elated.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 20": "Chapter 20 Satisfy your s*xual needsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayStanding next to Huo Yuting, Ruo Jiaojiao couldn\u2019t help but feel stifled by the icy air he was emitting. He was so eccentric and temperamental. If it wasn\u2019t because she had a favor to ask him, she wouldn\u2019t even have paid him any mind.She still preferred soft and delectable fresh meat like Shen Muyan.Female Lead!!This time, without even needing the system\u2019s reminder, Ruan Jiaojiao spotted Liu Luoxue who looked as moving and elegant as small lilies.Huo Yuting also had noticed her.Ruan Jiaojiao attentively poked Huo Yuting and winked at him, saying.\u201cIsn\u2019t that lady kind, pure and adorable? She\u2019s a good match for you.\u201dHuo Yuting originally thought the same, harboring a good impression of Liu Luoxue, however, when he heard these words come out from Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s lips, he always felt it strange.\u201cPresident Huo, let me be frank with you. I don\u2019t plan to continue mingling in the entertainment circle, my current reputation is too shameful and my parents aren\u2019t getting any younger, I\u2019m also an only child so I need to reconsider my circumstances for their sake.\u201dThe moment she saw Liu Luoxue, an idea quickly struck Ruan Jiaojiao. Feeling that nothing good would happen if she got involved with the male and the female lead, she put on a rare solemn face and told Huo Yuting her plans seriously.Huo Yuting narrowed his eyes, his expression becoming harder and harder to discern.\u201cAnd so?\u201d\u201cAnd so, I apologize to you. Back then, I was blinded by greed, I\u2019m guilty of a terrible crime, to actually dare covet and use you to climb up the social ladder. You can punish me any way you want but please help me get rid of the current scandal I\u2019m in. I want to retreat from the circle cleanly and in a low-key manner.\u201dRetreat?Huo Yuting felt his mood turn sour. This woman\u2019s words turned everything he was planning into waste.The reason why he brought her to this banquet was so that he could let a small actress like her see that all the resources she needed were completely right in front of her.Directors, producers, public relations media. Apart from giving her money, he could also help boost her popularity.But now, she was telling him, she had no desires nor favors.How vexing!\u201cSo I think you should go and fall in love with that girl, have a serious relationship, and satisfy your sexual needs through healthy ways lest our ambiguous relationship defiles your glorious image.\u201d Ruan Jiaojiao continued to chatter on, wearing an expression that looked as though she was being considerate of him.Defile?!At this moment, Huo Yuting was exercising utmost restraint in order to hold himself back from interrupting her.Once Ruan Jiajiao had finished speaking the words she thought to have been very reasonable, she lifted her head to look at Huo Yuting expectantly.However, faced with Huo Yuting\u2019s frosty handsome face, she was immediately rendered dumbfounded.What was going on? Why did he look angry again?!The male lead\u2019s temper was so bad. If she didn\u2019t have a favor to ask him, this great aunt wouldn\u2019t have fucking wanted to attend to him!\u201cI\u2026I want to go to the washroom\u2026.\u201dSensing that the situation was far from reassuring, Ruan Jiaojiao immediately planned to flee to the washroom.However, she didn\u2019t expect that Huo Yuting would abruptly seize her wrist and pinch it tightly. Hurt by his hold, Ruan Jiaojiao frowned and said.\u201cLet go of me, what do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201dThe two people\u2019s interactions naturally attracted a lot of attention.Seeing Liu Luoxue look over suspiciously towards them, Ruan Jiajiao inwardly cursed. If this female lead misunderstood them, once the male and female lead got together, she would suffer a calamity and run out of luck as a cannon fodder.Just as she was burning with anxiety, Huo Yuting suddenly spat out something unexpected.\u201cLet\u2019s go out!\u201dHis voice of proclamation wasn\u2019t low, so people nearby had heard it.While Ruan Jiaojiao was still still processing her shock over these words, Huo Yuting took one step closer to her, his arm snaking around her petite waist, nearly taking her whole person into his embrace. He lowered his head to her ear and used an ambiguous tone of a lover to say.\u201cYou said it yourself. Fall in love and satisfy my sexual needs through healthy ways.\u201dHearing this, Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s body turned stiff.System, did the male lead lose a screw in his head?Ever since Huo Tingyu confessed to her in public, Ruan Jiaojiao had been labelled as Huo Yuting\u2019s woman.At the same time, her reputation was also being washed clean. She wasn\u2019t some lewd slut who would shamelessly sell her body to climb up the ranks but was known as the girlfriend Huo Yuting was officially going out with.She didn\u2019t even give consent to this! How did she become the male lead\u2019s girlfriend!!System: \u201cPtooey! Why can\u2019t you be satisfied with what you have now!\u201dRuan Jiaojiao spat back at the system in retort.Ptoo Ptoo Ptoo! You think I wanted to become Huo Yuting\u2019s girlfriend!!How was she going to sleep with the little fresh meat from now on, she couldn\u2019t even happily roll in the sheets with other handsome guys!!Ruan Jiaojiao was really feeling resentful\u2026If she was going to be forced to look at the male lead\u2019s ice block face everyday and sleep with him for free under the guise of his girlfriend, she would rather leave this world!ASAP! Now! Immediately!When Shen Muyan came over, Ruan Jiaojiao immediately threw herself into his arms and complained tearfully.\u201cMuyan, do you remember the time I burst into your dressing room, I was complaining about a bigshot who wanted to do unspoken rules with me but I rejected him so he took revenge on me. That was Huo Yuting! He\u2019s now forcing me to become his girlfriend, woe is me, woe is me, wuuuuu\u2026..\u201dWhat a shameless act of manipulation\u2026The system thought, dumbstruck.Ruan Jiaojiao hugged Shen Muyan, genuinely sighing in lament on the inside, wuuu could she still take a bite of this tender and delicious young man?The two of them were currently locked in a tight embrace, enveloped in a soft atmosphere, when suddenly, the doorbell rang.Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s heart dropped down with a clunk as she hurriedly started tugging Shen Muyan into her own bedroom and pulled the closet doors open.\u201cMuyan, if he sees you, you\u2019re dead. Hide in here for a while.\u201dShen Muyan naturally felt unwilling to be stuffed into the closet, but faced with Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s teary charming eyes that contained pitiful imploration, he surrendered.Ruan Jiaojiao opened the door and found Huo Tingyu as expected.\u201cWhat are you here for again?!\u201d She said impatiently.Huo Tingyu glared at her, a head of green clouds hovering darkly over his head. <sup>1</sup> Green clouds is a euphemism for green hat which means that the person wearing it is being cheated on.\u201cThe paparazzi are downstairs. Shen Muyan was caught visiting you.\u201dRuan Jiaojiao was about to start ushering him out angrily but she quickly straightened her spine and haughtily told Huo Tingyu.\u201cI didn\u2019t agree to go out with you. The one I like is him!\u201dShen Muyan who heard these words behind the bedroom doors, hooked his lips up into a smile.However, Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s proclamation of love was only returned with a cold sneer from Huo Tingyu.\u201cTell this to the paparazzi yourself. I\u2019ll wait and watch you drown in the insults Shen Muyan\u2019s fans throw at you.\u201dAt this time, a pleasantly crisp voice rang out.\u201cJiaojiao, I\u2019ll leave the entertainment circle with you. I won\u2019t let anyone hurl insults at you.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She was an actress who was a part of the film she partook before.Recalling her enchanting and gorgeous face, Liu Luoxue felt very uncomfortable.When she came across the scene of that woman kissing and hugging Shen Muyan in private at the backstage of the press conference, this feeling morphed into a strong feeling of anger and jealousy.That woman called Ruan Jiaojiao actually dared to have her feet in two boats <sup>1</sup> To have feet in two boats means to have two lovers at the same time .She needed to expose her true face and prevent Huo Yuting from being deceived by such a shameless woman!Liu Luoxue clutched her phone tightly, preparing to stealthily take a picture as evidence. However, a hand suddenly fell on her shoulder, making her shiver out of fright.She turned around promptly and was met with a cold pair of black eyes.Teacher Qin?Qin Rui was the most extremely admired figure in Liu Luoxue\u2019s circle. Regardless of whether it was his looks, his acting skills or his character, to her, he was like a spring breeze and she secretly viewed him as her male god.Now, at this moment, her male god took her phone and sharply measured the photo on her screen.

She clearly\u2026.\u201dUnpleasant words were nearly about to burst out from her mouth but Liu Luoxue stifled them back. She was a wise and virtuous lady, she couldn\u2019t speak such filthy language.Qin Rui raised the corner of his lips, forming a clear smile.\u201cShe\u2019s certainly not a good woman, but\u2026what does that have to do with you? Clever girl, don\u2019t do anything that doesn\u2019t fit with your image, besides, you won\u2019t be able to get the man you want doing this.\u201dLiu Luoxue\u2019s face paled and she bit her lip.Seeing her appearance, Qin Rui knew she understood his implications. He turned around and was about to leave when Liu Luoxue asked him unreconciled.\u201cWhy? Why are you protecting her?!\u201dAt this moment, she was overcome with sorrow and jealousy, she could no longer maintain her expression and yelled out loudly without any concern.She wanted everyone to know!Qin Rui paused in his tracks, their small ruckus catching the attention of people nearby.However, the two people who were having a secret tryst, still didn\u2019t part, remaining in their mutual embrace.Liu Luoxue simply shed all pretense of cordiality and rushed towards Ruan Jiaojiao and Shen Muyan, criticizing Ruan Jiaojiao with a chest full of anger.\u201cYou\u2019re Brother Huo\u2019s girlfriend, how could you do this behind his back?!\u201dRuan Jiaojiao blinked, the corner of her lips twitching.\u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201dLiu Luoxue was about to blow her top off. She was still sticking onto Shen Muyan now. How could she tell such a bald-faced lie and refuse to admit it!This woman was simply too shameless!!Ruan Jiaojiao looked at the red-faced little beauty and innocently explained.\u201cI didn\u2019t do it behind his back. If you don\u2019t believe me, turn your head around and look. I\u2019m clearly doing it in front of your so-called Brother Huo.\u201dLuo Luoxue promptly swished her head around and saw the tall and slender figure she had been watching smittenly amongst the crowd, standing behind her. She didn\u2019t know how long he had been there and whether he had seen the whole course of events.At first, she was overjoyed, but then she suddenly recalled something and turned to look at Ruan Jiaojiao once again. But she only saw the woman remain in Shen Muyan\u2019s arms, appearing intimately close as conjoined twins, exhibiting no intentions of separating at all.Could it be\u2026.Could it be that her going out with Huo Yuting was a lie?! Were there any hidden secrets?!Luo Luoxue once again turned her head to Huo Yuting in bewilderment but the other party didn\u2019t spare her a glance. He gloomily walked towards them, intending to pull Ruan Jiaojiao away from Shen Muyan\u2019s arms forcibly but Ruan Jiaojiao held onto Shen Muyan tenaciously.Huo Yuting\u2019s complexion was fairly unsightly but he didn\u2019t get mad, his tone was ice cold as he uttered.\u201cLet go! Come with me!\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201dRuan Jiaojiao sounded extremely impatient as she glared at Huo Yuting.\u201cCan you please stop pestering me!\u201dLuo Luoxue was stunned at the scene happening right before her very eyes, her petite body shook for a moment as though she had suffered a strong psychological impact.In contrast to Liu Luoxue\u2019s reaction, Qin Rui was calm and unflustered, without the slightest fluctuation of emotion visible on his face.Ruan Jiaojiao was truly feeling exasperated, rolling her eyes on the inside. If her task hadn\u2019t been finished and she couldn\u2019t offend the male lead too much, she simply wouldn\u2019t have fallen into the present quagmire.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Muyan.\u201dOnce Ruan Jiaojiao weighed the gravity of the matter, she decided to appease the male lead first. Just as she was about to turn around and cast herself into Huo Yuting\u2019s embrace, Shen Muyan seized her wrist.\u201cJiaojiao! Don\u2019t go!\u201dThe rims of Shen Muyan\u2019s eyes were already red. He didn\u2019t know why but lately, Ruan Jiaojiao had been avoiding him and was unwilling to see him when she clearly said she likes him the most!It was because of this man in front of him. No matter how much the world praised him, no matter how amazing his identity and status was, he was just a beast who forced Jiaojiao to go out with him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22 The EndPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cMuyan, I\u2019m leaving. Don\u2019t miss me.\u201dRuan Jiaojiao left Shen Muyan this message before completely disappearing.News of her public announcement of withdrawing from the entertainment circle was still lingering around the internet with some rumors floating around that she was preparing to marry into a rich family. After all, celebrities often look bright and pretty on the surface but the entertainment industry was a billowing smoke of scumbags and snakes, it naturally didn\u2019t suit the image of being Huo Yuting\u2019s woman.Shen Muyan\u2019s eyes turned red as he shut himself in his dressing room. He kept calling Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s number over and over but only a mechanical woman\u2019s voice sounded, informing him that the other party had its phone turned off.He knew that she was forced to flee from Huo Yuting\u2019s tyrannical abuse.Just like that day, even if she was completely unwilling, she still left with Huo Yuting and even sent him an eye signal, begging him not to involve himself with their matters.As such, Shen Muyan could only watch wide-eyed as she pulled her hand away from his hold and the two people were pried apart just like this.It felt as though someone was hammering Shen Muyan\u2019s heart, making it hard for him to breathe.It has been a month since the woman had left.Huo Yuting was able to find records of her leaving the country but the trail was cut off once she had stepped foot into another country. Her parents were spending their holidays in Europe, seeming to be looking at houses with intentions to settle there.Huo Yuting had never felt this vexed in his life before. It was clearly her who provoked him in the first place, even resorting to the nasty use of drugs. Why did it now seem that their roles were completely reversed?Up until now, he couldn\u2019t figure whether he had been tricked or not.Though if there was one thing Huo Yuting had to admit, it was that his attitude towards her that night wasn\u2019t something to be proud of.However, despite having already publicly announced her to be his official girlfriend, she still continued to whisper sweet nothings to Muyan in front of him, making him wear the green hat of cuckold thrice and embarrassing him in front of others, leaving nothing of his dignity.If he didn\u2019t get angry, would he still be considered a normal man?!\u201cBrother Huo.\u201dLiu Luoxue looked at Huo Yuting with teary eyes. She finally understood what she felt towards him and now that she had learnt that the woman who had been cheating on him had finally taken the initiative to leave him first, she naturally started acting on her feelings.Huo Yuting looked at the pure and sweet girl in front of him but a touch of annoyance arose in his heart.He couldn\u2019t hold back his bubbling anger. If she hadn\u2019t gotten involved with her self-righteousness, exposing the ambiguous relationship between him and that woman, he wouldn\u2019t have had a falling out with that woman.He continued to turn a blind eye to further their relationship, hoping that the woman would slowly feel his sincerity and gradually become willing to make amends with him.The more Huo Yuting thought about it, the more he felt stifled. It felt as though a fish bone was stuck in his throat, a dense ball of impatience lodged in his heart, unable to be shifted from place.As such, he coldly swept Liu Luoxue a glance, unwilling to give her any shred of attention and strode forward, leaving the place.Liu Luoxue watched him depart with eyes of disbelief, sparkling tears pooling in her misty eyes.At this moment, a handkerchief was handed to her. Liu Luoxue lifted her head and saw Qin Rui. Though he displayed a gentleman\u2019s thoughtful behavior, having always been the perfect and gentle male god in her eyes, at this moment, his pupils were dark and gloomy, causing a chill to run down her spine.\u201cI told you back then. Don\u2019t provoke her. Even if she\u2019s out of the picture, you still won\u2019t be able to obtain the man you desire.\u201dSeeing that she didn\u2019t take the handkerchief he offered, he retrieved his hand and left these cold words of mockery, brushing past her shoulders.Liu Luoxue clenched her fingers tightly. It was as if she was given a fierce slap on the face, but on the inside, a voice in her heart seemed to be screaming in protest, complaining about this injustice.She had always felt that the matter shouldn\u2019t have unfolded like this. Brother Huo clearly treated her differently from everyone else before, so she was confident that he would fall in love with her. Besides that, Senior Qin Rui hadn\u2019t always been this cold, and Shen Muyan\u2026.She originally thought that Shen Muyan was approachable and that they\u2019d become good friends. But ever since she bumped into them and accused that woman of cheating in front of him, Shen Muyan seemed to loathe her very much.However, at this moment, she could only watch as Qin Rui\u2019s figure became fainter and fainter, and she could not utter a single word.The system broadcasted the above events for Ruan Jiaojiao to listen to.At this moment, Ruan Jiaojiao was wearing sunglasses and lying lazily on a chair, basking in the sun.A ball flew over and coincidentally stopped rolling by her feet.A handsome hunk with blond hair, blue eyes and sexy bronzed skin, walked towards her, wearing only his beach shorts.Tsk tsk\u2026With this body and alluring looks, even male models would pale in comparison.Ruan Jiaojiao almost made a catcall but she immediately lifted the blanket covering her body and picked up the ball to hand to the other party.She was wearing a black bikini, showing off her fair skin and red lips. Even though her round fullness couldn\u2019t compete with a foreign beauty\u2019s jugs, it was still an impressive sight to see, especially considering that she was a petite Asian beauty.The handsome hunk had actually noticed her long ago and had deliberately hit the ball to land right next to her.Even though this Asian girl was wearing sunglasses and lying in her place quietly, her character and looks were still particularly eye-catching.She took off her sunglasses, revealing a charming Eastern face which was even more beautiful than he expected, causing the handsome hunk\u2019s breath to stop.The handsome hunk then decided not to play ball any longer and instead, started using all the tricks he knew to hit on her.Ruan Jiaojiao was also feeling secretly giddy. Though she didn\u2019t understand what he was saying, his looks were very much her taste, especially that big big weapon he seemed to be hiding in his pants.System: \u201d\u2026..\u201dIts host seemed to have a parasite leeching on her brain, to think that she wanted to ooxx with the handsome hunk and have a taste of this exotic love. Even though it didn\u2019t have the heart to interrupt her, the system still needed to put out a reminder.Mission complete, you may now step into the next world.As a result, before Ruan Jiaojiao could even put her hands on the handsome hunk, she was ruthlessly taken away by the system.Ruan Jiaojiao: \u201c!!!\u201dNoooo!Author\u2019s note:The first world ends like this. If I feel like it, I might write an extra for this world in the future. After all, the female lead isn\u2019t some serious female lead, if I write a proper ending to this, it would just seem weird.Translator\u2019s thoughts (more like rant):Confused and surprised by how fast the world ended? Same. To be completely and perfectly honest, if this were not translated and I had read the raws first, I wouldn\u2019t have picked this novel up. So many things are lacking even for a smut without plot novel, for one thing, the disconnected scenes annoy me the most. However, if you still want me to continue translating, this, please do keep reading it, I will judge whether to continue translating this based on how many views it gets.Also, I noticed that the original translator didn\u2019t leave a summary of the different worlds available for this novel so here it is in case you\u2019re curious.I\u2019ll be moving it to the TOC page in the future but putting it here incase some of you haven\u2019t seen it.WorldsFirst World: The Infamous ActressSecond World: The Abandoned Perfect GirlThird World: The Shameless Demonic WitchFourth World: The Celestial Who Fell Down to EarthFifth World: The Betrayed Underworld AssassinSixth World: The Bullied \u201cGreen Tea Bitch\u201dSeventh World: The Marquis\u2019 Mistress Who Was Used As A Stand-InEighth World: The Canary in CaptivityNinth World: The Little Slut That Everyone ReviledTenth World: Little Jiaojiao Who Was Ravaged By AliensEleventh World: The First Female Demonic Head of the Cultivation WorldTwelfth World: The Little Lady of the Mafia Head.Thirteenth World: The Love Battlefield of the Rich and PowerfulFourteenth World: A Woman in a Chaotic World Must Be Self-ReliantFifteenth World: A Survival GameSixteenth World: Jiaojiao\u2019s Leisurely VacationSeventeenth World: It\u2019s Isn\u2019t Easy To Become A StepmotherEighteenth World: Wilderness Survival Guide: Dodder or Man-Eating Flower?Nineteenth World: You Little Minx (City)Twentieth World: The Survival Guide Of A Hated Supporting FemaleTwenty-First World: This Abominable Witch (Gods and Demons)Twenty-Second World: What To Do When The Male Lead Is A Pervert?Twenty-Third World: How To Handle Four Shitty Male Leads?

Her p*ssy unable to ignore the hot thick c*ck stirring and thrusting frantically inside.\u201cSurprised? Shocked?!\u2019While she was being f*cked by the man in a frenzy, the system\u2019s smug voice rang out.Ruan Jiaojiao, \u201c\u2026..\u201dShe opened her eyes but her field of view was completely pitch black.\u201cMotherf*cker!\u201dShe blurted out this profanity, shocking the man atop of her to stop in the act and turn the lights on.When the black room suddenly became bright, it allowed Ruan Jiaojiao to see the other party\u2019s face quickly.Even though she was already experienced in bed matters, the man\u2019s attractiveness still took her breath away.Moreover, it was her favorite type of fresh meat. His face was handsome and tender, yet also carried a twinge of the delinquent, roguish type.Ruan Jiaojiao felt very satisfied. Her lecherous hands streaked across the man\u2019s firm yet supple pecs and abs. The man also seemed to be stunned by her attitude which she returned with an extremely warm and bright smile.\u201cWell what are you waiting for? Go on, don\u2019t stop moving!\u201dBefore she could even thoroughly enjoy this affair, the system\u2019s prompt rang out abruptly.\u201cIn one minute, your fianc\u00e9 will be entering through that door and catch you red-handed in your affair ohohoho!~\u201dThe system was unable to suppress the excitement in its tone.Pffff!Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s smile froze as if she was struck by lightning, yet the system turned her words against her to unscrupulously mock her.\u201cWell what are you waiting for? Go on, don\u2019t stop moving!!\u201dRuan Jiaojiao, \u201c\u2026.\u201dAt this moment, the system started counting down in a smug manner.Nineteen! Eighteen! Seventeen! \u2026\u2026Ruan Jiaojiao decisively kicked the man away and nimbly rolled off the bed, picking up the scattered clothes on both the bed and the floor then crawling under the bed and holding her breath, not daring to exhale loudly.At this moment, the door was pushed open and someone walked in.How thrilling and exciting!Ruan Jiaojiao stared at the glossy men\u2019s leather shoes and the straight long legs wrapped in black trousers, visualizing the appearance of the original host\u2019s fianc\u00e9.\u201cHave you seen Ruan Jiaojiao?\u201dThe man\u2019s voice was cold, gloomy and magnetic but his tone revealed an air of indifference as he talked about her.\u201cYou barged into my room to find your woman?\u201dThe young man who had been having a passionate time with Ruan Jiaojiao minutes ago, asked in amusement, his tone mocking.The two seemed to have been stuck in a stalemate for a while before her fianc\u00e9 left the room first.Ruan Jiaojiao heaved a breath of relief. She had just finished receiving the plot.This was a melodramatic and clich\u00e9 story about a separated couple reconciling and reuniting.However, this time, her role wasn\u2019t that of a cannon fodder but a very important supporting female in the book.Her fianc\u00e9 was the male lead Ji Che, who once had a pure campus love with the female lead Su Xue. Due to the difference in their status and lifestyle, and the female lead\u2019s strong self-esteem, the two people often quarreled over trivial matters which eventually led to their break up.Many years later, despite Ji Che having been arranged a fianc\u00e9e who matched his status, he couldn\u2019t forget his feelings for the female lead, treating her existence like a white moonlight <sup>1</sup> White moonlight is a term used to refer to things or people that you covet or desire but cannot attain. .And though the female lead had a warm and caring boyfriend, she often reminisced and regretted her past love.Later on, they were reunited and through all sorts of coincidences, their feelings for each other were revived. The male lead ultimately chose his true love, the Cinderella female lead, abandoning his perfect fianc\u00e9e behind.After learning the plot, Ruan Jiaojiao once again discovered the system\u2019s nasty taste in plots. This bugger was clearly up to no good!Because in the original book, there was simply no such thing as the current scene playing out!Rolling in the bed with her younger brother-in-law and putting a green hat on the male lead? What the hell was going on?At this moment, the system explained mischievously.Before he cheats on you, I helped you cheat on him first, whaddya think? Aren\u2019t you happy? No need to thank me too much!Ruan Jiaojiao responded through gritted teeth.\u201cIn that case, I really have to thank you for your kindness.\u201dIf she hadn\u2019t reacted quickly, she would\u2019ve been caught red-handed by the male lead in bed alright!! Hmphh!!At this moment, her younger brother-in-law Ji Xun, popped his handsome face under the bed and wore a wicked grin.\u201cSister-in-law, shall we continue?\u201dRuan Jiaojiao pouted her lips at him and calmly ordered.\u201cLock the door first. I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll turn impotent if it happens once again.\u201dCrawling out from under the bed, Ruan Jiaojiao didn\u2019t rush to continue her saucy affair with her younger brother-in-law. Instead, she walked to the mirror and appreciated the beauty of her current body.Mmm! She was very satisfied.As her character design was the perfect girl this time, apart from having a beautiful countenance, she had an exceptionally elegant character, magnanimous bearing and even her hair exuded the alluring fragrance of affluence.While she was admiring herself in the mirror, a man\u2019s hot body stuck close to her bare back, leaving no gap between their bodies. His stiff hard d*ck grinded between the seams of her derriere, expressing its impatience and poking at her slightly.\u201cSister-in-law, are you dissatisfied with my performance? How could you still be in the mood of looking in the mirror?\u201d\u201cAhnn\u2026..\u201dRuan Jiaojiao called out tenderly as she was pushed by Ji Xun and pressed against the mirror.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24 [2nd World 2] Done \u2018Til She BledPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayJi Xun lifted one of Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s legs up and glanced at her reflection in the mirror. His narrow eyes glinted with a mischievous light, his lashes were thick and there was a small mole at the corner of his eye. His lips hooked up in a smirk, giving off a sinister licentious vibe.Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s heart uncontrollably skipped a beat. At this, she couldn\u2019t help but feel grateful for the system for making her put a green hat on her fianc\u00e9e and bestowing her immense luck with beauties as soon as she arrived.Ji Xun raised his lips in a smile, pressing his thin lips on her ear for a kiss before inserting his long thick c**k slowly into her little p**sy.\u201cLook at how I put it in you carefully, my dignified and beautiful sister-in-law.\u201dAs soon as his voice fell, his malevolent c**k immediately plunged straight into the depths of her flower pot.\u201cAhhhhh\u2026..\u201dRuan Jiaojiao\u2019s soul nearly left her body from this thrust of his.She felt like she was going to die from his frantic thrusting. Seeing the originally virtuous and dignified beautiful face in the mirror, dyed with the tides of lust, her eyes carrying pools of tears, her expression wearing an unspeakable licentious heat.Her lips were slightly ajar, her tongue at a loss on what to do inside. Ji Xun stared her enraptured expression and turned her head strongly to give her a fierce French kiss, plunging his tongue deeply into her throat while his member plundered the deepest parts of her body even more wantonly and viciously.Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s head turned blank from Ji Xun\u2019s wild and unruly p*netrations, her erect br**sts shook madly following their intense movements. She fell back into his arms like a drowning person, his arms wrapped around her in support as her body fell completely limp.She panted for breath, feeling the surging waves of peaking bringing her ashore\u2026.\u201cI-\u2026.I can\u2019t anymore\u2026.\u201dShe cried out softly. Ji Xun skillfully grasped her slender waist and turned a deaf ear to her pleas, still maintaining the high intensity pounding.\u201cMmhhhhhh\u2026\u2026\u201dThis body was inexperienced and sensitive. How could it withstand such heavy and ruthless f**king? Ruan Jiaojiao couldn\u2019t help but raise her head and moan as she was pushed to cl*max. Her whole body fell limp in Ji Xun\u2019s arms, and he enveloped her firmly in his embrace.Ji Xun watched the girl in his arms reach orgasm from being f**ked by him. Sweat seeped out of her forehead, causing a few strands of her hair to stick onto her porcelain white skin. Under the warm orange lights, there was an indescribable beauty to her, like an exquisite piece of crystal, fragile yet emitting a breath-taking beauty.Her cheeks were flushed and her pearly whites were biting on her tender lip. Before the high could even fade, her eyes possessed a watery luster, exuding an inexplicable allure.Ji Xun stared at the girl who leaned softly and weakly in his arms, recalling the first time he had met her. She was the proper daughter of a wealthy family, a virtuous lady from a prestigious house.It was his brother\u2019s engagement ceremony back then, and he had been called to return to the country by his parents from abroad.Ji Xun casually appraised Ruan Jiaojiao for a moment before retracting his gaze, feeling that it was merely yet another boring political marriage. He had never been interested in this type of woman.However, he didn\u2019t expect to reap a harvest today. This woman had shown him a side to her that was unfamiliar, especially when she took off her clothes, turning into such an unexpected enchanting beauty.Ji Xun hoisted Ruan Jiaojiao up and placed her on the bed. He sincerely admired her beautiful naked body, marinating in the details for a few seconds. Unable to hold back his surging desires, he grunted and pried her legs apart, impatiently sticking his meat stick into her tight wet cave.Ruan Jiaojiao narrowed her eyes and spread her legs, allowing Ji Xun to toss and turn her around. Even though she enjoyed this affair, the more he plundered her, the more it started to hurt, so she reached out a hand to feel around the place they were joined at, but only saw a red liquid staining her fingertips.Despite being shocked frozen for a few seconds, Ji Xun kept madly f**king her without any concerns, as such, her anger was immediately stirred, and she raised a foot to kick him away.A muffled \u201cKathunk\u201d sounded and Ji Xun was kicked off the bed caught unguarded. Before he could even react, he saw Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s pretty face twist in anger, her brows furrowed as she howled at him.\u201cLook at what you\u2019ve done!! You\u2019ve f**ked me til I bled!!\u201dRuan Jiaojiao ran to the bathroom butt naked, only to confirm that it was actually her great aunt that had come for a surprise visit <sup>1</sup> This means that her period came. .Confronted with Ji Xun\u2019s dark mien, she smiled sheepishly and immediately admitted her mistake.\u201cSorry for blaming you wrongly. Looks like there\u2019s no way of continuing today. Let\u2019s talk about this next time.\u201dSeeing that the atmosphere had turned awry, Ruan Jiaojiao was prepared to put on her clothes and slip away. Ji Xun watched her from the side with his arms crossed, picking up the cigarette and lighter from the bedside cabinet. Just as he was about to light it, a fair hand reached out and took the cigarette away from his mouth.\u201cDon\u2019t smoke. It would be bad if the smell clung onto my body.\u201dJi Xun raised a brow, his lips hooking up into a nefarious smile.\u201cAs expected, sister-in-law is very attentive.\u201dHe took a step and pulled Ruan Jiaojiao into his arms.His figure was so tall that Ruan Jiaojiao seemed particularly petite and dainty in his arms. The invasive testosterone he emitted caused Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s legs to turn soft, stirring her amorous feelings and making her heart feel itchy.\u201cSister-in-law, you really surprised me today.\u201d Ji Xun\u2019s sultry voice and breath brushed past her ears.\u201cBrother-in-law also surprised me today.\u201dRuan Jiaojiao turned around and faced Ji Xun.She raised her head to look at him but seeing that there was a bit of difference in their heights, she gave him a push, and Ji Xun obediently complied, sitting down on the bed.En, this height was much more comfortable.Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s finger hooked up Ji Xun\u2019s chin, her glossy pink lips pressing against his and her tongue licking the corner of his lips.Before today, the two did not exchange any suggestive actions, let alone any interactions.Ruan Jiaojiao didn\u2019t have any good impression of this Ji Xun. Rumors outside say that he deals with matters without any scrupulousness, his behavior was reckless without restraint and afraid that he would invite disaster onto their family, his parents sent him abroad.Just an hour ago, the original host was having a dispute with Ji Che.And upon realizing the existence of the white moonlight, Su Xue, in Ji Che\u2019s heart, and finding out that the two had a reunion, disputes arising between them had become the norm.The original owner was proud and arrogant, having grown up pampered with all the attention on her. Moreover, the reason she had gotten engaged to Ji Che was because she liked him, not because of the robust wealth and influence the Ji Family had nor to establish familial connections with them.That was why she could not accept that Ji Che held another woman in his heart! This fact made her mad with jealousy!!Of course, Ruan Jiaojiao did not find it weird that the original owner acted extremely lovesick. As a proud girl who was born with a golden spoon in her mouth, she was blessed in every aspect possible and didn\u2019t lack anything nor chased anything. Upon easily falling in love, she had lost her sense of reason.The so-called \u2018one mistake leads to fatality\u2019 described her situation perfectly. For the sake of a man, a proud rich daughter like her was reduced to a laughingstock, her self-esteem taking a hit. The original owner reluctantly framed the female lead, intending to destroy the feelings between them but little did she know that she was just a malicious supporting female who served as a stepping stone to further the male and female lead\u2019s love in this melodramatic romance novel.The system had mischievously tampered with the plot so when the original owner discovered the encounter between Ji Che and Su Xue, she had been burning with jealousy and anger. And blinded with these negative emotions, upon bumping into her brother-in-law Ji Xun who was on his way back to his room, she forcefully kissed Ji Xun as a way of retaliating against Ji Che, but didn\u2019t expect Ji Xun to react back, pulling her directly into his pitch black room.\u201cAre you sure this was only done for revenge? Not because she fell for his charms?\u201dRuan Jiaojiao couldn\u2019t blindly agree with the system\u2019s explanation.If Ji Xun were to be replaced by a bald and paunchy ugly man, she reckoned that the original host wouldn\u2019t have the guts to throw herself at him.The system only gave a vulgar chuckle in response to Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s ridiculing words.\u201cAs long as you complete the mission, you can do whatever you want.\u201dT/N: Hey guys, short note.

    "Chapter 25": "Chapter 25 [2nd World 3] Tongue-tiedPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayRuan Jiaojiao didn\u2019t forget the mission this time.She couldn\u2019t help but sigh\u2026Speaking of which, the original host\u2019s wish made her feel tongue-tied.Apart from wanting to change her destiny of being abandoned, she was unwilling to give up and was dead set on destroying the marriage between the male lead and female lead, becoming disturbingly paranoid.The system curiously asked.\u201cDo you think this mission is difficult?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not the slightest bit difficult at all!\u201dRuan Jiaojiao was quite confident in herself. She could immediately cook up several mischievous schemes.\u201cThen, why do you look so depressed?\u201dRuan Jiaojiao couldn\u2019t help but sigh again as she quietly said.\u201cI can\u2019t be abandoned by the male lead and I have to destroy both the male and female lead, that means I have to bear the name of a married woman for a long time and I can\u2019t sleep with the handsome man out in the open.\u201dThe system, \u201c\u2026..\u201dBut very quickly, as though she had managed to figure out something, the dispirited look on her face was swept clean, her eyes gleaming in delight\u201cBut keeping a clandestine love affair seems to be quite exciting!\u201dRuan Jiao rubbed her hands excitedly.One week later.Ruan Jiaojiao came to the Ji residence for dinner and Ji Che couldn\u2019t help but measure her several times.There was something unusual about his fianc\u00e9e. After the last time they got into a fight, she hadn\u2019t come to see him for a whole week, nor had she contacted him.In reality, the two still had feelings between each other.Even though the two weren\u2019t as affectionate as how normal lovers were, their relationship was still considered to be harmonious. Moreover, his parents were very satisfied with her. That was why he had agreed to the marriage, and how everything fell into place.After ending his unforgettable first love, Ji Che felt that he had already spent too much energy on that woman. That woman called Su Xue seemed to have wasted all his youth.Several years after their break up, he would occasionally think of her. After the two were reunited, he was unable to help himself and grew closer to her and that was why when his fianc\u00e9e had discovered their encounter, their originally harmonious relationship started to show cracks.Upon encountering Su Xue several times by coincidence, Ji Che found that she could still form ripples on his calm lake of heart, his heart still beat for her.Because of this, Ji Che began to contemplate whether or not to terminate his engagement to Ruan Jiaojiao.However, a man\u2019s heart was always so fickle. Even if he initially wanted to dissolve their marriage contract, when Ruan Jiaojiao acted contrary to his expectations and treated him coldly and indifferently, it not only befuddled him but also made him feel unpleasant.Particularly when she ignored him who was her fianc\u00e9 yet smiled like a flower at his younger brother Ji Xun. The two people would exchange glances whenever they met and it even carried a bit of ambiguity. Were they exchanging flirting glances?Ji Che frowned, was this just his misconception?Ji Che immediately shook off this weird thought that popped out of nowhere.Ever since he was young, the pair of brothers were as different as sky and earth. He was perfect and outstanding, the target of all the women\u2019s affection whereas Ji Xun was a troublemaker, often sporting a bruised face and was a little devil that girls feared and kept away from.If Ruan Jiaojiao were to know of Ji Che\u2019s thoughts, she would have certainly jeered at the male lead\u2019s overconfidence.From a secular perspective, Ji Che was certainly more attractive to women.But from her perspective, she still preferred Ji Xun\u2019s bad boy behavior. He was unrestrained in bed and was so rough in lovemaking that he could bring a woman from death and back.After dinner, Ji Che mentioned that he had something he intended to discuss with Ruan Jiaojiao so she followed him up the stairs.Speaking about it, ever since the two were engaged, apart from holding hands, they rarely even kissed.After all, for Ruan Jiaojiao, it was her first time falling in love. She maintained the bashfulness of a young girl and felt that the man should always take the initiative in a relationship. Because of this, her passive attitude resulted in little physical contact between the two.\u201cWhat did you want to tell me?\u201d Ruan Jiaojiao looked indifferent, her tone light.Faced with this kind of Ruan Jiaojiao, Ji Che was rendered stunned for a while.Little did he know that his fiancee was thinking about how she was left unfulfilled with her last affair with his younger brother-in-law, so their footsie under the table earlier had caused her to feel impatient and she only wanted to go back and continue rubbing and feeling good. Seeing Ji Che\u2019s hesitant face, she grew slightly irritated.\u201cJiaojiao, recently, I\u2019ve been thinking about our engagement.\u201dJi Che was, after all, the male lead, so he was quickly able to recover his senses and get to the point.Ruan Jiaojiao was dumbfounded.Fuck! Was this bastard trying to break their engagement?!Motherfucker\u2026This was all her fault for slacking off. It wasn\u2019t easy to have become the perfect girl <sup>1</sup> The title of this arc \u2018The Abandoned Perfect Girl\u2019 uses \u767d\u5bcc\u7f8e (Bai Fu Mei) or Fair, Rich and Beautiful to describe the perfect girl in chinese so Ruan Jiaojiao is referring to the current body she\u2019s in when she says that she\u2019s become the perfect girl. PS. If you\u2019re curious, the perfect guy in chinese is \u9ad8\u5bcc\u5e25(Gao Fu Shuai) or Tall, Rich and Handsome but because she had been preoccupied with swiping her card, shopping here and there, she had almost forgotten about this matter.Ji Che\u2019s thin lips parted. Seeing that he was about to continue speaking, Ruan Jiaojiao was so scared she immediately wrapped her hands around his neck and tiptoed to kiss him, instantly blocking his mouth.Although he was disrupted by the sudden kiss, since Ji Che was still the male lead, he still had a basic sense of self-control and only pursed his thin lips without responding to her, intending to let her calm down before continuing.Ruan Jiaojiao became annoyed.Tsk. This scumbag. Not even responding to her kiss, do you think this grandma wanted to kiss you! This grandma only wants to wholeheartedly sleep with your brother!Just as Ruan Jiaojiao shifted her lips away, Ji Che was about to continue his previous topic but she blocked his lips with her hands this time around.\u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to say anything that will make me unhappy. I just want you to kiss me!\u201dShe glanced at him affectionately, her tone carrying an unprecedented tenderness to it that Ji Che was rendered stunned by her sudden change in attitude.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26 [2nd World 4] Something was wrongPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayRuan Jiaojiao knew clearly in her heart that the male lead naturally wasn\u2019t someone easy to deceive, so when she covered Ji Che\u2019s lips, her eyes worked hard to squeeze out tears.In an instant, a heartbroken and bitter expression emerged on her beautiful delicate face, glistening teardrops twinkled in her lustrous eyes, her pearly whites biting down on her lip. Due to the fluctuation in her mood, a red flush appeared on her fair cheeks.Ji Che had never seen this kind of Ruan Jiaojiao before. It was as if he had gained a new found understanding of this woman, of his fiancee.She seemed to have done this because of him, finally being unable to take it any longer. Was this all his fault?So perhaps in truth, this woman knew exactly what he wanted to say and had been backed up to a wall, discarding all her pride and self-esteem in a gamble and taking the initiative to kiss him, but due to his cold indifference, she felt hurt and was now spilling tears because of him.When Ruan Jiaojiao noticed the ripple in Ji Che\u2019s eyes, she knew that he had been shaken and was relieved, loosening the hold on his mouth.However, she knew that he was only baffled for a while. It didn\u2019t mean that after he had calmed down, he wouldn\u2019t muster his staunch confidence and decisively take action.\u201cJi Che\u2026\u201dRuan Jiaojiao lowered her head sadly, her slender fingers clutching onto the corner of his clothes.\u201cCan\u2019t you at least give me some face? I know what you\u2019re thinking. Just give me a bit of time and I\u2019ll sort out my feelings. Besides\u2026this isn\u2019t only about us, it\u2019s about our two families. Let\u2019s go about it slowly so that the older generation will have time to mentally prepare themselves.\u201dRuan Jiaojiao knew that she couldn\u2019t convince Ji Che on her own so she continued the struggle and even used a bargaining chip.Ji Che\u2019s parents were very satisfied with Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s background and character so they had been the ones to facilitate this engagement in the very beginning.Unsurprisingly, Ji Che agreed to Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s request and upon seeing her gaze, his expression became a little more complex.Ruan Jiaojiao did not give a hoot about what the male lead was thinking. For her, this unforeseen event was equivalent to being splashed with cold water just after taking delight in the fact that she had transmigrated into the body of a perfect girl.After all, the male lead and the female lead have had a relationship before, if she weren\u2019t careful, the two would have shagged up and she would have abandoned in a heartbeat.What fucking lousy luck she had!!For the sake of maintaining a desponded appearance in front of the male lead, Ruan Jiaojiao could only secretly gulp down her desire for the male lead\u2019s younger brother on the inside as she dejectedly left the Ji Residence.Sitting in the car, while looking at the waning lit nightscape outside, Ruan Jiaojiao sighed quietly.Ji Che looked at his own fiancee and couldn\u2019t help but reach out a hand to brush the hair covering her cheeks, taking her dispirited look into his eyes. His heart sank, feeling a bit uncomfortable.This gesture should have been normal considering the relationship of the two but it was Ji Che who had initiated it, and especially considering that things have been a bit awkward between them most recently, both of them were taken aback.Ruan Jiaojiao was flummoxed for a while before she suddenly raised the corner of her lips, revealing a smile. Ji Che felt slightly regretful, wondering if this action of his would cause her to misunderstand.\u201cJi Che, I know the one you like isn\u2019t me. Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ve already figured out a way. When I also fall in love with another man, we can break our engagement then. This way, it\u2019ll be fair, right?\u201dRuan Jiaojiao\u2019s words stunned Ji Che for a good while. The two had been stuck in an awkward and silent atmosphere just now and he had started regretting being soft hearted, wondering whether she would still harbor delusions about him. He also didn\u2019t know if her previous words were only spoken just to delay matters but was, in truth, a scheme to retreat for the sake of advancing.But now, she was clearly telling him that she would fall in love with someone else just to make it fair.What else could Ji Che say following Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s straightforward attitude?After sending Ruan Jiaojiao home, on the way back, Ji Che suddenly had a strange thought.Looking at her words from another perspective, was she planning to fall in love for the second time while still carrying the name of his fiance?Ji Che couldn\u2019t resist furrowing his brows.But he also had someone in his heart, so it shouldn\u2019t matter whether she fell in love with some other man.Then, why did he feel that something was wrong?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Fresh meat actually sent himself to her door.Ruan Jiaojiao raised her head and looked at Yan Xingyan who was blocking her.She hadn\u2019t had time to assume an innocent dazed and started expression when Yan Xingyan cut right to the chase.\u201cI\u2019m curious. What intentions does Miss Ruan have towards my girlfriend as Mr. Ji\u2019s fiancee?\u201dUhh\u2026Well\u2026Actually, this grandma rather has intentions towards you.Since the opposite party was already so direct, Ruan Jiaojiao no longer assumed a facade and stared straight at Yan Xingyan, mocking neither coldly nor warmly.\u201cMr. Yan is such a handsome, elegant and talented man. But why can\u2019t he hold his girlfriend\u2019s heart firmly? I don\u2019t understand why she has to keep looking into other people\u2019s pots when she already has her own bowl to eat.\u201dSystem: You just wanted to praise him for being good-looking, didn\u2019t you!!Yan Xingyan was a little taken aback. He didn\u2019t think that Ruan Jiaojiao would say such words so he didn\u2019t know how to respond and had actually turned mute for a while.However, in the next second, Ruan Jiaojiao had reached out and taken off his glasses, catching Yan Xingyan off guard.\u201cEh? These are actually just plain glasses, what are you wearing them for? To be a pretentious prick?\u201dYan Xingyan simply couldn\u2019t believe his eyes. Was this coarse and frank speaking woman in front of him really the daughter of the Ruan Family?The good demeanor he cultivated for years had nearly cracked.Yet Ruan Jiaojiao only played with his glasses, wearing it on her nose bridge and even leaning her face in front of him to let him get a closer look.\u201cMiss Ruan, please conduct yourself with dignity.\u201dThe distance between the two had become a little too ambiguous, so Yan Xingyan took a step back.Ruan Jiaojiao took off the glasses but didn\u2019t return it to him.\u201cMr. Yan, I\u2019m sure that we share the same standpoints. Your girlfriend and my fiance\u2019s previous relationship have led to the awakening of their remnant feelings for each other today. I know that Mr. Yan is a smart man, who knows what it means to allow the current situation to develop further, which could only bode ill for the both of us.\u201dWithout the glasses, Yan Xingyan\u2018s pupils visibly darkened and he started emitting a gloomy and unfathomable air, his tone dark.\u201cWhat is Miss Ruan trying to say?\u201d\u201cI was trying to stay that since we\u2019re both being cheated on, let\u2019s give them a taste of their own medicine!\u201dYan Xingyan, \u201c\u2026..\u201dSystem: \u201cPft, you took the words right out of my mouth!\u201dRuan Jiaojiao burst out into laughter and patted Yan Xingyan\u2019s stiff stature, even taking advantage of the situation to feel him up a bit.Oho? \u00a0He\u2019s quite impressive. He might look refined and scholarly on the surface but his figure\u2019s not bad.\u201cI\u2019m kidding\u2026you wouldn\u2019t have really believed it, would you?\u201d Her eyes curved, forming crescents as she smiled, revealing a hint of mischief.Yan Xingyan couldn\u2019t understand this woman\u2019s train of thought. He had never come across such an unfathomable woman as her.\u201cDo you really like Ji Che?\u201dWhy did she sound so casual mentioning her fiance?Ruan Jiaojiao snaked her arms around Yan Xingyan\u2019s waist in the next instant, her claws still randomly feeling around.\u201cWhat do we do? I seem to have fallen for you at first sight!\u201dYan Xingyan\u2019s face was dark when he returned to the restaurant, taking Su Xue by surprise. She had never seen her boyfriend with fury written all over his face.\u201cXingyan, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d she asked.He had been molested by a mad woman!!Was this something you could say out loud?Of course!At this moment, Yan Xingyan had already labelled Ruan Jiaojiao as a nut job.But, what he absolutely didn\u2019t expect was that this nut case could actually do something that was even more brazen and horrifying.And that was making him lose his chastity!!T/N: Next chapter basically skips to him having his virginity (forcefully) taken.

If this is not your cup of tea, don\u2019t waste your breath and skip the chapter.<figure></figure>The moment Yan Xingyan recovered his senses, he realized that something was wrong. He opened his eyes abruptly and a sense of incredulity and despair surfaced on his usually calm and composed countenance.He couldn\u2019t believe it!At this moment, his hands and feet were both tightly bound to the bed with a strong nylon rope and he was unable to move a single inch.\u201cMr. Yan, you\u2019re awake.\u201dA soft voice rang out and a beautiful, elegant face appeared in his view.You?!!It was the madwoman!! Ji Che\u2019s fiancee!!!Seeing that Yan Xingyan was awake, Ruan Jiaojiao appeared cold, seemingly completely different from the frivolous woman who had lecherously groped his last time.But, under these circumstances, how could Yan Xingyan have the mind to notice the difference!\u201cWhy did you kidnap me?\u201d He tried his best to maintain a calm tone as he asked.He had just been in the company today, handling affairs until late and just as he turned in a parking lot corner, someone had covered his nose with a towel without warning, rendering him unconscious.Faced with Yaning\u2019s questioning, Ruan Jiaojiao raised a brow, but in the next moment, she climbed atop of the bed and sat down on top of him.Her following actions nearly made Yan Xingyan lose his mind.\u201dWhat the hell are you trying to do?!!\u201dRuan Jiaojiao was actually sitting on top of him, unbuckling his belt. The crisp sound of metals clinking rang out and the clothing on Yan Xingyan\u2019s waist loosened as she pulled the belt off and casually threw it on the floor.Then, she pulled down the zippers of his pants strongly and hauled off his underpants.Following this action, Yan Xingyan\u2019s sex was exposed in the air. He shut his eyes, taking deep breaths. When he opened his eyes again, the woman\u2019s decisive appearance entered his eyes, mixed with bravery and even great bitterness?!When Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s soft hands made contact with the limpid object in between Yan Xingyan\u2019s legs, he nearly sucked in a breath of cold air, still believing that the scene happening in front of him was too bizarre and too unbelievable.However, when the woman\u2019s soft hands started softly stroking his sensitive d*ck, he couldn\u2019t control his physiological reaction as an indescribable numbing electricity surged from his abdomen.He was hard!! She had actually gotten him hard!!Ruan Jiaojiao lowered her head and watched his d*ck attentively, turning it even harder until it became thick and long. He had turned so big it had started to hurt a little because her nails were digging into him!!Yan Xingyan nearly lost his mind having his root of life fall into the clutches of this strange woman. However, he still maintained a cool-headed look on the surface, despite the fact that the thin sweat on his forehead, his pursed lips, tightly clenched fists and heaving chest were already giving him away.\u201cNow do you know what I want to do? I want to r*pe you\u2026.Mr. Yan\u2026\u201dSuch terrifying words easily came out of Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s mouth so heedlessly.Yan Xingyan took a few more deep breaths but found it difficult to suppress his ragged breathing.\u201cWhat\u2019s your purpose?\u201d He asked.If Ruan Jiaojiao were not sitting on the man at this moment, with one hand holding onto his member, as she slowly moved up and down lasciviously from position, the air between them could have been considered solemn and hostile.Ruan Jiaojiao swept a light glance across Yan Xingyan and finally released her hold, pulling her skirt up and reaching inside, taking off her underwear in front of Yan Xingyan.Today, she had worn a long silk skirt and a knitted sweater. Her face was completely devoid of any cosmetic powder, but she still looked charming and pretty, a complete contrast to her current behavior.Ruan Jiaojiao looked at Yan Xingyan, propping two hands beside his body. She hesitantly and slowly shifted her butt to his crotch and held his er*ct c*ck, aiming it towards her entrance.Realizing that she was being serious, Yan Xingyan\u2019s long-cultivated educated demeanor crumbled down and he finally couldn\u2019t hold himself back from bellowing.\u201cAre you mad! Do you know what you\u2019re doing?!\u201dRuan Jiaojiao bit her lip, the light in her beautiful eyes flickered, revealing a tinge of purity. She licked her dry lips seemingly to ease her tension and nervousness.\u201cI know. I want Ji Che to get what he wants, to obtain the woman he loves, and Miss Su also loves him, so I hope you can do them a favor, Mr. Yan.\u201dRuan Jiaojiao revealed a sweet yet distressed expression as she blinked. A big teardrop leaked out of her eye, trickling down her face.\u201cIf something were to happen between us, then you and Miss Su definitely wouldn\u2019t be able to stay together.\u201d Ruan Jiaojiao gave a low sigh.After saying this, she seemed to put on a determined look and while Yan Xingyan was still struggling to process her words, she aimed his stiff and hard c*ck at her entrance and sat down in a huff.\u201cSorry! Ahhh\u2026. It hurts\u2026\u201dShe was the one r*ping others yet in the end, she was the one who let out a miserable shriek, her body quivering and her face turning pale.While Ruan Jiaojiao was engrossed in acting out her melodramatic play, the system couldn\u2019t hold back from interjecting.\u201cWhat the hell are you doing? Isn\u2019t making the second male lead break up with the female lead adding fuel to the flames? You\u2019re supposed to break them up, not play matchmaker!!\u201dRuan Jiaojiao gave a profound yet nefarious smile, saying.\u201cI\u2019m doing exactly the opposite! In the original plot, if the supporting male and female hadn\u2019t created any conflicts and entanglements, adding twists and turns to the plot, the male and female lead wouldn\u2019t have so easily reconciled. Moreover, they had a reason for breaking up back then. If there weren\u2019t any obstructions or disturbances in their path, they wouldn\u2019t have had a rebellious mindset to overcome all obstacles and insist on being together.The woman\u2019s words sounded quite logical to the system but upon mulling it over\u2026Who the hell was she kidding! She was obviously finding an excuse to sleep with the second male lead!!In any case, Yan Xingyan had started to believe Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s excuse.To tell the truth, he really couldn\u2019t find a more reasonable explanation.If the daughter from the grand Ruan Family didn\u2019t have a loose screw in her head, why would she force herself on some unfamiliar man? If this were to be exposed, it wouldn\u2019t be of any benefit to her, in fact, it would only negatively affect her reputation, making her sink into eternal damnation.The only explanation was that she loved Ji Che so much she had lost her rationality because of him.What a pitiful psychopath!!For the first time in his life, Yan Xingyan wanted to curse someone!But\u2026Because her earlier action was borderline self-abuse, his c*ck being sucked tightly by her flower cave, Yan Xingyan was feeling slightly odd.He should\u2019ve felt despair for being r*ped by a girl, but physiologically, he couldn\u2019t help but admit\u2026that he felt shamefully and extremely good\u2026.However, after Ruan Jiaojiao took his c*ck into her, she remained motionless. Yan Xingyan\u2019s body and mental state had been drawn taut to the extreme. His head was in shambles as his mental and physiological states were engaged in a fierce battle, he felt conflicted and entangled.He wanted her to get off of him but he wanted her to move even more.In reality, Ruan Jiaojiao was truly in pain. Her previous shriek was not false, it had really come from the stimulation she had felt.The two did not do any kind of foreplay as she had only taken off her underwear and directly climbed atop. Her c*nt wasn\u2019t even wet enough. After putting on a show of dramatic tension, she abruptly sat down on him, causing the massive girth to open up her dry passage.She was in pain\u2026.so much pain that cold sweat was seeping out\u2026F*ck!The gap in men and women\u2019s physiology made it unfair for women to even carry out such a scheme like rape.The system couldn\u2019t help but interject again.\u201cYou could have just achieved your goal by drugging him, why go through such a brainless route?\u201dRuan Jiaojiao slowly loosened up. She lowered her head and with both hands propped against the bed, she started moving slowly. She raised her body, pulling out a little and then slowly sat down. Under the pure friction of their bodies, her sensitive hole was slowly stretched open, and pleasure started to surge. Her p*ssy started secreting lascivious liquid, lubricating the area they were joined at.Phew\u2026She heaved a breath of relief. After getting used to it, this sensory experience wasn\u2019t bad at all.\u201cI\u2019ve only acted in scenes where I was the one being r*ped, not the other way around, so I\u2019ve always been curious to try it out.\u201d She said, finally satisfying the system\u2019s curiosity.System, \u201c\u2026..\u201dAs expected, she was just vulgar and obscene!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

To her, he was just a tool. \u00a0For Ji Che\u2019s sake, she established an illicit affair with him just to get him to break up with Su Xue.Yan Xingyan then realized that since the beginning up until now, he had never even thought of his girlfriend.He liked Su Xue because she met his expectations of his ideal partner. She was smart, independent, lively and beautiful, the perfect person to add a touch of color into his dull life.However, when he found traces that Su Xue was unable to forget her feelings for her ex-boyfriend, he was certainly unhappy. It was natural for a man to feel possessiveness towards his other half.He didn\u2019t want to seem like a small minded man so he didn\u2019t question her about it, instead, he sent someone to investigate and was able to draw his own conclusions. Apart from this small lingering affection, there was nothing that dissatisfied him.But now that the situation has progressed to the present, according to this woman, he would have to break up with Su Xue regardless of whether he was willing to or not.Yan Xingyan cleared his thoughts and his originally alarmed heart also recovered its calm, quickly accepting the reality.Ruan Jiaojiao had only wanted to do a r*pe play on a whim. She sat atop of Yan Xingyan and moved for a while and when laziness finally hit her, she immediately got tired of the game.But, it wasn\u2019t easy to have kidnapped this man to bed, and she hadn\u2019t even tasted muchRuan Jiaojiao cast Yan Xingyan a resentful look as if he had done her wrong.Having finally let go of his grudges and was preparing to enjoy the forced sex since he couldn\u2019t resist anyway, Yan Xingyan was speechless.Why did this woman stop now!Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s whole body turned soft and limp, lying weaklessly on top of Yan Xingyan\u2019s body. She snaked her arms around his waist and gloomily asked.\u201cDoes this count as doing it? Are you going to break up with Su Xue?\u201dYan Xingyan tried to hold back his anger but to no avail. He barked.\u201cUntie these ropes for me. Now.\u201dRuan Jiaojiao quivered, seeming a little afraid. She asked with a quivering voice.\u201cAre you going to hit me?\u201dYan Xingyan pressed down the urgency in his tone, sounding more tolerant.\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d\u201cYou promised that. You won\u2019t hit me.\u201dRuan Jiaojiao looked at him, her gaze actually carrying a little naivety. She untied the ropes while muttering apologies.\u201cPlease don\u2019t hate me. Su Xue loves Ji Che so please just treat me as a fellow sympathizer. It\u2019s true that what I did to you wasn\u2019t right. After all, you are in the same boat as me, we\u2019re both unable to get the ones we love, so at least let them have their own happiness. I hope that Ji Che can go out with the woman he loves and of course, if you wish for me to compensate you, as long as you don\u2019t ask for anything out of my abilities, I will\u2026.Hik (sniff)\u2026.\u201dRuan Jiaojiao rambled on endlessly but moved slowly. Just as she untied one of Yan Xingan\u2019s hands, he impatiently put a stop to her long-winded words, kissing her on the lips.Good, she finally shut up.At this moment, Yan Xingyan didn\u2019t notice that he had plenty of other ways to make this woman shut up but he still chose to kiss her. This showed that the earlier unfinished affair made him unable to maintain his rationality.Yan Xingyan very quickly untied the other ropes bounding his hand and legs and after regaining freedom of movement, he quickly turned around and pulled Ruan Jiaojiao underneath him.\u201cYou said that you wanted to compensate me right? That you\u2019ll do anything I ask?\u201dWithout his glasses, his deep dark eyes narrowed, revealing a sharp and dangerous glint.The system couldn\u2019t help but utter tsk tsk\u2026Sure enough, men were beasts who thought with their lower body. No matter how educated or serious he was, even if he hated the woman so much his teeth itched, he was still provoked by his desires, as such, after attaining freedom, he only wanted to roll in the sheets with her.Ruan Jiaojiao assumed a dumbfounded look, quivering. In this kind of position where the man dominated the woman, it was natural for her to feel a little apprehensive.However, on the inside, she was actually hooting madly in encouragement.COME ON, BABY! MAKE IT RAIN!!Hottie!! Don\u2019t take pity on me just because I\u2019m a delicate flower!!Seeing Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s timid face made Yan Xingyan waver slightly. However, his hesitation was soon overwhelmed by the burning lust in his bodyHe looked down at their current condition and saw that Ruan Jiaojiao had taken off her underwear whereas he was still wearing his pants, having his belt undone by her.In fact\u2026He could also take a few seconds to pull his zippers up and immediately recover his cold and calm demeanor. He could end this absurd farce and stay far away from this neurotic woman.Ruan Jiaojiao saw that Yan Xingyan remained still and couldn\u2019t help but reflect on whether she had acted too excessively. This man wouldn\u2019t just stop here, would he?As soon as this thought came up, she was immediately alarmed. How could she let this piece of juicy meat go after having just taken a lick!!While Yan Xingyan was feeling entangled, the woman beneath him started to misbehave. She quickly reached out a hand in the speed of lightning and grabbed a hold of his c*ck!!She held onto him very tightly as though she was afraid he would leave\u2026Yan Xingyan, \u201c\u2026..\u201d\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dHe asked darkly. Clearly, he should have had the upper hand between them, yet time and time again, this woman\u2019s unreasonable action completely took him by surprise.Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s fingers gripped Yan Xingyan\u2019s member firmly. With bright eyes, she was afraid that the peculiarity in her behavior would look too schizophrenic and so, she shyly lowered her eyes and softly whispered.\u201cI thought\u2026.what we did earlier felt good\u2026do you\u2026.want to do it until the end?\u201dYan Xingyan was stunned by her frankness, however, it was soon replaced by a pleased feeling and his original gloominess and restlessness were swept away.Ruan Jiaojiao could feel the member in her hands twitch and it felt scorching hot, shooting a current of numbing electricity into her lower abdomen and making her hole feel more itchy. An intense lust and emptiness made her feel as though she couldn\u2019t wait to immediately have this c*ck pound her c*nt.She cast Yan Xingyan an urgent and yearning look.Yan Xingyan also turned a little red from her scorching gaze.Ruan Jiaojiao felt that the dry \u201cwood\u201d was already ready, it only needed a little spark, and so, she stuck out a pink tongue and licked her soft lips. She raised her neck and wrapped her arms around the man\u2019s shoulder, pressing her lips against his cool, thin lips.\u201cWuuu\u2026You can treat me as your girlfriend, I won\u2019t mind\u2026\u201dAfter saying this, she felt his body stiffen and he seemed to have turned colder.\u201cWhy? Are you going to treat me as Ji Che?\u201d Yan Xingyan spat out this chilly sentence in return.Such a gentle and refined man had a very ugly look on. The smile on Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s face stiffened and she cursed herself on the inside.Who told you to open your stupid f*cking mouth!!Ruan Jiaojiao quickly shook her head, and said in an attempt to remedy.\u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t treat you as him! I\u2019ve never done it with him because he loves your girlfriend!\u201dYet, Yan Xingyan\u2019s mood remained sour. He coldly stared at Ruan Jiajiao, making her delicate figure quiver inadvertently.In an instant, she summoned her acting prowess again, squeezing out a few tears as she stared at Yan Xingyan with watery eyes.\u201cI was telling the truth that day, when I said I fell in love with you at first sight!\u201dYan Xingyan couldn\u2019t tell which of the woman\u2019s words were real or false but his heart certainly skipped a beat from her confession.On the other hand, Ruan Jiaojiao couldn\u2019t wait any longer. Feeling that the fire would be completely doused if this situation persisted, she immediately spread her legs and wrapped them around Yan Xingyan\u2019s waist. Holding his c*ck, she positioned it to her entrance and lifted her rump upwards.With a \u201cpuchi\u201d sound, she inserted half of the c*ck inside. Afraid that he would resist, Ruan Jiaojiao immediately held onto him with all of her limbs and once again and thrusted her rump upwards, taking the entire thing in.T/N: Taking a break for the whole of Feb. Updates will come on March. Thanks for understanding!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 30": "Chapter 30 [2nd World 8] Trying to steal a chicken only to end up losing the rice used to lure itPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cAhhh\u2026.\u201dIt felt so good\u2026The two people\u2019s bodies turned limp from the sudden union. Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s cave had already started turning wet from her desires so the entry this time had gone much more smoothly. Her little cave was spread apart by his c*ck, and the flesh of her walls immediately started to greedily suck on the massive member that invaded her.To tell the truth, Yan Xingyan had already enacted all his intentions towards the girl and had gotten a bit used to acting tyrannical.Moreover, he had been unable to come to a decision for a long time but after being approached so barbarically and aggressively by her, all his worries instantly vanished. At this moment, he had only one thought in his mind, he wanted to f*ck her!Regardless of who she was and regardless of what her intentions were, he only wanted to taste her body.Yan Xinyan\u2019s waist dropped down, causing Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s suspended body, clinging onto him, to instantly touch the mattress. Then, he moved forward, slamming his c*ck deeper into her hole and this friction brought about such indescribable ecstasy to the point Ruan Jiaojiao couldn\u2019t stop herself from letting out a moan.Her charming voice stimulated Yan Xingyan and as if having turned a motor on, he started moving intensely, pounding deeply into her cave like a pile driver.Ruan Jiaojiao simply didn\u2019t think that Yan Xingyan would actually have such a fierce and rough side, so this discovery made her pleasantly surprised. She became more engrossed in the act, enjoying the pleasure brought about by their physical entanglement.For a while, the woman\u2019s delicate moans and the man\u2019s heavy pants intertwined in the room. Without exchanging any words, the two lost themselves deeply in their union.Perhaps because his previous intentions of struggling prolonged the wait of his desire, after Yan Xingyan pounded her to his fill, he penetrated her very deeply and shot out his hot thick essence deep into her cave.When he pulled away from her body, he felt slightly bewildered.Yan Xingyan was not a man with heavy desires. When he was dating Su Xue, he always acted like a gentleman, usually holding her hand, sometimes even initiating kisses to fulfill his affectional obligations, but they were also done half-heartedly.He also had physiological desires but he would normally relieve them through exercise.However, today, this woman had managed to stir up his long suppressed desires through her incomprehensible behavior.Once the man had a taste of meat and strayed off the vegetarian lifestyle, how could he be satisfied by just eating once?Yan Xingyan\u2019s gaze turned dark and deep like the night sky. His rod that had just turned soft, quickly stood erect once again.Once something had happened, it would repeat itself again. Now that they had broken through that obstacle, he had turned completely unconcerned.Ruan Jiaojiao lifted her gaze and stared right into Yan Xingyan\u2019s dark eyes brimming with desire, turning stunned. Immediately after, the corner of her lips hooked up into a smile, and an enchanting allure appeared on her dignified and pretty face.\u201cDo you still want more?\u201dYan Xingyan didn\u2019t respond, merely using actions to express his thoughts.He looked at the woman laying beneath him and bent down, pressing his thin lips against her ruddy lips. His slender long fingers trailed into her skirt, stroking her smooth satiny skin.\u201cTake it off.\u201d He spat three words out, concisely and forcefully.The two people hadn\u2019t taken off their clothes up until now.Ruan Jiaojiao narrowed her eyes and reached her hands towards her back to hold the zipper, however, her hands turned languid as laziness once again overwhelmed her. She turned around.\u201cHelp me pull the zipper down.\u201dYan Xingyan pulled her zipper down to the bottom. This was the first time he had taken off an article of clothing for a woman. The two didn\u2019t even share any relations, having only met for the second time.As soon as the zipper was pulled down, the woman\u2019s pretty figure was revealed. Her white jade-like skin caused Yan Xingyan\u2019s breath to turn heavy and he lowered his head, pressing kisses on her bare back. The act was akin to peeling an egg. Taking her out from her clothes, her beautiful and lustrous body was revealed.Ruan Jiaojiao turned around and faced the front, looking at Yan Xingyan. At this moment, only her white lace bra was left intact, holding her plump br*asts. Although they weren\u2019t considered huge, they were still perfectly shaped, her red cherry nipples peeking through the white lace.While appreciating the sight of this beauty, Yan Xingyan felt an impatient urge for the very first time. He wanted to pull away the remaining piece of cloth and stick her br*ast into his mouth, sucking strongly and f*cking her hard several times \u2019til she broke like a beast.But just as he was about to enact on his desires, she crossed her arms, blocking his way.\u201cYou also have to take your clothes off.\u201dYan Xingyan was stunned before he broke into laughter from her frank words of pursuing equality. He quickly unbuttoned his shirt and threw off his pants and the two candidly exposed themselves to each other.Ruan Jiaojiao did not act the least bit ashamed at all. She calmly started measuring Yan Xingyan\u2019s figure.Even though Yan Xingyan\u2019s muscles were not as defined as Ji Xun\u2019s, she could still see that he frequently worked out. His shoulders were wide, his buttocks were narrows, he was unexpectedly impressive. His skin was on the fairer side but not the snow white that girls desired to be. It was an ivory white that perfectly complemented a gentleman.Yan Xingyan could see the admiration in Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s eyes and actually felt a bit proud of himself. However, he couldn\u2019t help but claim once again that he had never seen such a bold and honest woman.\u201cCan we continue now?\u201d He asked politely.Ruan Jiaojiao loosened her arms, even arching her back to raise her pair of perfectly soft jugs towards him as though she was presenting a tribute.Yan Xingyan circled his arms around her back and tried to undo the buckle but his actions were clumsy and he couldn\u2019t unhook it despite several attempts. Ruan Jiaojiao chuckled and quickly undid it herself.Once her br*asts were released from their confinement, Yan Xingyan hooked his fingers around the straps and pulled it down .He lowered his head and parted his lips, taking the alluring little fruit into his mouth, sampling its taste.Ruan Jiajiao\u2019s n*pples were contained in his warm mouth and his tongue continuously flicked the red tip, turning it a little itchy and a little sore. She mewled in response, rubbing her legs together and feeling the heat envelop her body. She wrapped her arms around Yan Xingyan\u2019s body and their skins stuck close to each other without any obstructions.She held his head as he buried himself into her bunnies. His hair tickled her skin as he continued sucking on her warm mounds, increasing her arousal.\u201cMmm\u2026.Quickly enter me\u2026I want it\u2026.\u201dRuan Jiaojiao spread her legs, wiggling her rump on the bed impatiently. Yan Xingyan watched her red cheeks, her teary pupils and silky eyes. Every part of her exuded a tempting seduction, like a prostitute in bed. Who would\u2019ve thought that she was a wise and virtuous daughter from a prestigious house in the outside world?This kind of distinct contrast only stirred Yan Xingyan\u2019s desire to explore her wild side. He wanted to see what she looked like, as she lost herself in depravity.As for the lovemaking that was about to come next, the two took to it familiarly like a fish takes to water.Yan Xingyan aimed himself at her flower seams and rubbed at the entrance, purposely inserting half an inch while he pressed his finger onto her nub and grinded it, eliciting a pleasured cry out of her lips.\u201cIs it here?\u201dRuan Jiaojiao hummed in agreement.Yan Xingyan only let out a low laugh before he plunged his whole length into her warm cave. And just as he invaded her, turbid liquid leaked out of the area they were both joined at, it was the remains of their previous intercourse. Once he started thrusting into her, he could hear the sloshing sounds of sticky liquid ringing.\u201cCome on top. Move by yourself.\u201dRuan Jiaojiao knew that he was deliberately doing this in retaliation for the previous incident and couldn\u2019t help but cast him an angry glare.\u201cYou\u2019re so mean!\u201dEven though these words came out of her mouth, her hole still strongly clamped onto his meat stick, fearing that he would really pull out and leave her to fend for herself.\u201cI don\u2019t have any more strength. R*pe was too tiring\u2026I beg you\u2026don\u2019t make me go on top\u2026\u201dRuan Jiaojiao didn\u2019t have any moral principles as she uttered her pleads without any difficulties.Yan Xingyan had just been speaking casually, how could he not know how lazy the girl was when she previously stopped just after moving twice, as such, he found her difficult to torture.However, he didn\u2019t want her to lie down without making any effort. He pulled her up from bed and grabbed her waist, making her sit on his lap.Because of this posture, Yan Xingyan\u2019s d*ck was inserted very deeply, hitting the innermost parts of her cave. This made Ruan Jiaojiao sensitively feel each and every move he made.Ruan Jiaojiao didn\u2019t need him to tell her to hold onto his shoulder tightly and quickly twisted her waist like that of a snake, making his c*ck hit her sensitive spots precisely.\u201cAhhhh\u2026Ohhh\u2026I\u2019m coming\u2026Mmhh\u2026\u201dShe had just cried out when Yan Xingyan fiercely kissed her and turned her scream into sobs. Gripping her slender waist, he ferociously quickened his pounding and the two soon reached cl*max together.Then, Ruan Jiaojiao lost count of how many times she had done it with Yan Xinyan. The two of them kept doing it in bed to the point she felt that she had a bit too much of this meat to eat.Never did she expect beforehand that the scholarly-looking Yan Xingyan could actually last so long. She could feel him pounding her c*nt sore and the bed had already turned into a huge mess, the scent of s*x permeating the air.\u201cI\u2026I can\u2019t anymore\u2026\u201dRuan Jiaojiao pushed Yan Xingyan\u2019s approaching body and pinched him angrily. At this moment, his body was covered with her scratch marks, front and back, whereas her fair skin was covered with little strawberries he had planted.Yan Xingyan kissed her swollen lips and stuck his tongue inside her mouth. Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s tongue had already turned numb so she turned her head to avoid him.\u201cGo away!!\u201dShe tried to kick him but he spread the base of her legs and once again inserted his hot iron rod into her swollen cave.Beast!! This insatiable beast!!Yan Xingyan f*cked Ruan Jiaojiao til she was in tears, her whole body losing strength. She could only lay there powerlessly until exhaustion overwhelmed her and pulled her into dreamland.Within her slumber, she seemed to have heard the system\u2019s scummy voice heartlessly jeering at her.\u201cI can\u2019t believe you wanted to r*pe a man with this kind of strength, you tried to steal a chicken only to end up losing the rice used to lure it. <sup>1</sup> This means to try and gain an advantage only to end up worse off \u201dF*ck!It was just a small setback. Wait til this granny gets some rest and she\u2019ll show you another thing or two!Important announcement from tler:After a month of hiatus and gaining some realizations, I\u2019ve decided to drop this novel.I think it\u2019s better for someone else who likes this novel better and can put more chapters out per week to take over this project rather than have me continue it half-heartedly especially when I don\u2019t even like the writing. (It\u2019s also 600+ chapters and ongoing after all, so you\u2019re looking at a minimum of 600-1200+ hours going into translating just to finish this novel.)With that said, I will only translate up until the end of the third arc (Demonic Sect Witch) so interested translators can pick up from there and please notify me about picking it up by contacting me on Discord or on the Contact Us page.

    "Chapter 31": "Chapter 31 [2nd World 9] Yan Xingyan wanted to cursePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cGood morning.\u201dRuan Jiaojiao opened her eyes and upon seeing Yan Xingyan\u2019s refined and handsome face inches away from her, she blinked. Once her consciousness became clearer, she couldn\u2019t help but frown.Why was this guy still here?Yan Xingyan seemed to see through what she was thinking and his heart sank. At this time, a phone started ringing so he could only answer it.Su Xue was the one who had called. Yan Xingyan didn\u2019t avoid Ruan Jiaojiao, instead, he cast glances at her while answering the phone.Ruan Jiaojiao pulled off the quilt and got off the bed naked. Without even looking at Yan Xingyan, she headed straight to the bathroom which soon emitted splashing sounds.Yan Xingyan only spoke with Su Xue shortly before hanging up the call. He had asked to meet Su Xue today and had already made his resolve yesterday, having no intentions to delay his decision.Ruan Jiaojiao was currently taking a shower. The bathroom door was opened and in walked Yan Xingyan. He looked calm and composed, walking over to her naturally and standing underneath the showerhead together with her, the warm water trickling down the two people\u2019s naked bodies.She lazily cast him a glance but when Yan Xingyan reached out a hand to take her into his arms, sticking the two bodies close, Ruan Jiaojiao felt the man\u2019s crotch starting to stir recklessly.She pressed a hand against Yan Xingyan and turned to the side, pulling the distance between the two.\u201cMr. Yan. I\u2019ve already achieved my goal. I don\u2019t think we should have anything outrageous happening between us again.\u201dHearing this, the look on Yan Xingyan\u2019s face turned frozen, his actions turning stiff.The system couldn\u2019t help but utter \u2018tsk tsk\u2019.This woman was really cold and heartless!!Ruan Jiaojiao wrapped a bathrobe around herself and left after pushing Yan Xingyan away.10 minutes later, Yan Xingyan saw Ruan Jiaojiao already dressed properly and drying her hair on the bed. Her expression was cold and not once had she given him a look ever since coming out of the bathroom.If it weren\u2019t for the traces of mess on the bed reminding them of their joyous affair yesterday, he would\u2019ve thought he had been hallucinating how deeply he was buried in the woman\u2019s body and how tightly the two had been entangled the previous night.Yan Xingyan pursed his thin lips. He was not a man who kept ambiguous relationships, especially with women who were already taken. He recalled the words she said before and looking at her current attitude, his belief strengthening.\u201cI\u2019m going to break up with Su Xue today.\u201d He calmly said.Ruan Jiaojiao hummed in acknowledgement but still didn\u2019t lift her head.Just as Yan Xingyan was about to speak, Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s phone rang. She picked up the call and the look on her face immediately changed.Ji Che had just called her and he was nearby the area, intending to come visit her on the way.\u201cJiaojiao, I\u2019m at your house downstairs.\u201dRuan Jiaojiao quickly turned her head to Yan Xingyan and looked a little flustered.Shit! If Ji Che were to catch her, her mission would be in imminent danger.The system watched its lascivious host try to get out of a pickle in schadenfreude.\u201cWait for me downstairs, I\u2019ll be there in a moment.\u201d\u201cNo worries, I\u2019ll come up to find you.\u201dShe also didn\u2019t know what was going on with Ji Che. seeing that he was acting particularly proactive today, Ruan Jiaojiao only felt very stifled.Forget it!She casually said a few words listlessly before hanging up and looking at the time.Shoot\u2026it was already afternoon\u2026\u201cJi Che is going to come up in a while. Don\u2019t go out of the room. You can leave once we\u2019re gone.\u201dAfter Ruan Jiaojiao said her own piece, she realized Yan Xingyan\u2019s expression looked unsightly, and so, she added a few more words.\u201cAfter all, you\u2019re still someone else\u2019s boyfriend. It wouldn\u2019t be too good for you if someone else were to discover all of this.\u201dYan Xingyan felt something blocking his chest. Looking at her unfazed expression that didn\u2019t contain a tinge of shame or guilt, he was rendered speechless.And so, he stayed inside the bedroom, listening to her conversing with Ji Che. Once the two people had left, he came out of the room with a stuffy heart and left Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s residence.When Yan Xingyan brought up the matter of breaking up to Su Xue, Su Xue was at first shocked. She immediately asked him for a reason and seeing that he looked conflicted, she no longer tried to ask him and sadly accepted it. Perhaps because she still harbored lingering affections for Ji Che, she was already mentally prepared for them to break up.Originally, Yan Xingyan thought that he was going to feel sad after breaking up cleanly with Su Xue. After all, he dated Su Xue with a sincere heart, however, in the dead of the night, a certain enchanting woman twisting and turning in an attempt to pleasure him, appeared in his dreams, making his member swell until it started hurting. Upon reliving the night they had crazily entangled their bodies and comforting himself, a strange stuffy feeling remained in his chest, making it so that he couldn\u2019t dwell too much on his lost love nor feel sad about it.And this stifling feeling didn\u2019t fade away with the passage of time. Instead, it picked up intensity.The whole week after that incident, not once did Ruan Jiaojiao call him. She also didn\u2019t announce the absolution of her marriage with Ji Che as though nothing had ever happened between them at all!!Yan Xingyan started to feel as though he was unhesitantly thrown away by the woman after being used\uff01Could she have regretted it? Did she not want to help Ji Che and Su Xue get together?! Then what was he to her?!Yan Xingyan didn\u2019t want to admit it but he had no choice but to realize that he didn\u2019t want to have just a casual fling with her.Shrouded in this gloomy thinking, he finally did something he never would\u2019ve expected himself to do.He stalked Ruan Jiaojiao.Then, he saw the woman who kept saying she loved Ji Che to the point she was willing to give him everything, hug Ji Che\u2019s younger brother affectionately. The two people looked very close, the atmosphere around them sticky and sweet.If he didn\u2019t know the inside story, in other people\u2019s eyes, they would\u2019ve looked like an enviable couple, made up of a good-looking man and a beauty.Seeing this scene, for the first time in his life, Yan Xingyan felt the urge to curse.F*ck!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 32": "Chapter 32 [2nd World 10] Testing the watersPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayYan Xingyan narrowed his eyes, the pupils behind the lenses turning gloomier and darker. He pursed his lips into a straight line, the originally scholarly and handsome face now hiding a dangerous air.Ruan Jiaojiao who was sitting not too far away, was completely clueless about all of this. For today\u2019s date, she specially dressed differently from her usual style, donning a white tee and a denim skirt, revealing fair legs and even sporting a high ponytail, appearing youthful, lively and charming.The original owner\u2019s fashion was more on the coservative side and although it made her look virtuous and pure, it also seemed old-fashioned. For the sake of matching with Ji Xun and preventing others from misunderstanding them as brother and sister, she spent quite a lot of effort on dressing herself up.Inside the dark movie theater, the interweaving warm colors of light and shadows of the big screen projected on the two bodies that were behaving intimately, highlighting the ambiguity of their actions.Ruan Jiaojiao intentionally chose a slow-paced romance film not for the sake of watching it but to flirt, to flirt!If they had chosen some blockbuster action movie that was extremely loud with special effect sounds, how could they focus on making little tempting moves. It hadn\u2019t been long since the film started when Ruan Jiaojiao and Ji Xun looked at each other and released a signal. The two people\u2019s lips pressed together and the atmosphere became sweet and dense, the two people losing scruples about their surroundings.Apart from the two, there were also a few other couples inside the theater. The two were seated near the rear so they didn\u2019t attract a lot of attention.Of course, flirting was allowed in public places, but anything more than that would just attract scorn.Ruan Jiaojiao rubbed her delicate and beautiful face against Ji Xun\u2019s arm.\u201cI\u2019m hungry. Let\u2019s go.\u201dJi Xun looked at the screen. It had only been 10 minutes since the film had started. However, this foreplay was enough.He hooked his lips up into a faint smile whereas Ruan Jiajiao lifted her face. The two met eyes and no words were exchanged between them.\u201cSister-in-law, should we go to your place or mine?\u201d Ji XUn neared her ear and asked softly, his tone akin to a lover\u2019s whisper with a twinge of provocation that made one\u2019s heart itch.After Ruan Jiaojiao had gotten engaged, she moved out of the Ruan residence expecting to get more opportunities to spend some alone time with Ji Che, but she never expected that she would have her first sexual experience with another man instead.And ever since coming back from abroad, Ji Che didn\u2019t think it was convenient for him to live in the Ji residence.The previous fling they had was enough, if they did it again one more time, she felt like testing the waters continuously would only lead to certain doom.As for opening a hotel room, Ruan Jiaojiao felt that with her identity, it would only be inappropriate.As such, Ruan Jiaojiao decided to bring Ji Xun back to her own place.However, before this, she decided to go get some takeout at a restaurant.She told Ji Xun she was hungry which was a double entendre. After all, by nature, we desire food and sex.Ruan Jiaojiao and Ji Xun had just arrived at the restaurant when her cellphone rang. Ruan Jiaojiao knit her fine brows. She had no idea what was going on inside the male lead\u2019s head in recent days. Just as she had stopped bothering him, he, on the other hand, started to ask her out on dates.As far as she knew, Yan Xingyan had already broken up with Su Xue, so shouldn\u2019t he be taking this opportunity to swoop himself back into her heart?\u201cWhere are you? I just finished work, let\u2019s go get something to eat together.\u201d Ji Che\u2019s words were concise and succinct. His voice was low and magnetic, emitting a kind of charm only male leads had.\u201cNo need, I\u2019m already at the restaurant.\u201d Ruan Jiaojiao tactfully declined.Who could\u2019ve expected that Ji Che wouldn\u2019t give up.\u201cWhich restaurant, I\u2019ll come over and find you.\u201dRuan Jiaojiao choked at this and looked at Ji Xun.\u201cI\u2019m with a friend right now, it\u2019s not convenient.\u201dShe felt that her attitude was already crystal clear but didn\u2019t expect that Ji Che played the ignorant card once again and simply spat out one word.\u201cAddress?\u201dRuan Jiaojiao couldn\u2019t bring herself to offend the male lead. After all, even if her desires usually took control of her, she still knew that she had a mission to complete.The system tsk-ed once again. It must be hard on you.Since the male lead was coming over, Ruan Jiaojiao could only cast Ji Xun a tangled and difficult gaze.\u201cYour brother\u2019s coming over to find me, you\u2026\u201dJi Xun should probably realize what she meant with just these words. It was going to be troublesome trying to explain why they were together if they bumped into him.\u201cThen let\u2019s all go together. I\u2019m also hungry.\u201d Ji Xun cast her a wicked gaze that said \u2018This daddy doesn\u2019t want to go so don\u2019t even think about driving me away.\u201dThis insensible brat!Ruan Jiaojiao took her purse.\u201cThen you can eat by yourself here. I\u2019m going somewhere else.\u201dIf you don\u2019t want to leave, I\u2019ll be the one to leave instead.\u201cI\u2019ll tell him what happened between us. You shamelessly seduced me and as a hot-blooded young man, I\u2019ve committed a mistake I shouldn\u2019t have made.\u201d Ji Xun said indifferently.Ruan Jiaojiao instantly sat back on her chair as if nothing had happened and put on a considerate, affectionate and kind expression.\u201cLittle brother, come. Let\u2019s order some dishes first. What do you want to eat?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

See what you\u2019d like to eat.\u201dSeeing her gentle smile, Ji Che swallowed all his doubt and decided to ask her when they were left alone in private.However, when Ji Che\u2019s gaze landed on Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s body, he noticed that her attire was different from what she usually wore, it was a subtle yet distinctive difference.The man wore a black bomber jacket and denim jeans, appearing handsome and confident. The girl wore a hoodie and denim skirt, appearing youthful and pretty. He had just finished a business meeting so he was donning a straight suit, appearing like the older brother of the two.And they were the pair of lovebirds.Ruan Jiaojiao naturally noticed Ji Che\u2019s odd gaze and she told herself to keep calm.Hold yourself! You can hoodwink your way through this!Ji Xun reached a hand out to take the cup in front of her and drank the remaining half a cup of water, even ambiguously licking his lips.Fuck! There\u2019s always a wicked citizen trying to harm zhen <sup>1</sup> Zhen is the term chinese historical emperors used to refer to themselves !!Flip table!Ruan Jiaojiao stood up.\u201cI\u2019m going to the washroom.\u201dJi Xun, this little brat, even just put his hand on her thighs and felt her up!If the male lead weren\u2019t here, this would be considered having a little fun. If the male lead was here by their side, this would be considered digging a pit for her!Ruan Jiaojiao came out of the bathrooms and was once again obstructed by someone.Seeing Yan Xingyan abruptly appear in front of her, she was dumbfounded in place.\u201cMiss Ruan, long time no see.\u201dYan Xingyan\u2019s gaze was unfathomable. His usually gentle mien appeared to be covered with a gloomy air which made Ruan Jiaojiao take a step back in alarm.\u201cCan I help you with something?\u201d Ruan Jiaojiao asked.\u201cBecause of Ruan Jiaojiao, I am without a girlfriend now.\u201d Yan Xingyan\u2019s tone was slightly low.\u201cSo?\u201d Ruan Jiaojiao finally felt a bit guilty, shifting her eyes away.If you often walk by the riverside, you\u2019ll certainly get your shoes wet. <sup>2</sup> This means you reap what you sow. She had a feeling that Yan Xingyan was here to make trouble for her.\u201cYou hooked up with me to make Ji Che get together with Su Xue, so why are you hooking up with his younger brother? Is it so that you can enhance their brotherly feelings and increase family harmony?\u201d Yan Xingyan uttered the last few words through gritted teeth, the mockery in his tone extremely apparent.Seeing Ruan Jiaojiao look aghast, the system laughed particularly happily.Since you insisted on sleeping with the second male lead, suffer the consequences of your own actions.Confronted with Yan Xingyan\u2019s hostile and aggressive behavior, Ruan Jiaojiao lowered her eyes and stayed silent for a while, feeling as if there was a bone stuck in her throat. She then lifted her head to look at him.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I lied to you.\u201dShe had on a calm look that accepted her fate that was also mixed with relief.\u201cEverything that I\u2019ve done is to take revenge against Ji Che. Do you remember what I said during our first meeting?\u201dYan Xingyan\u2019s heart promptly dropped. Hearing her say that it was for the sake of taking revenge against Ji Che with a particularly calm tone and expression, it looked like the calm before the storm.\u201cI told you since we were both being cheated on, why not give them a taste of their own medicine!\u201dRuan Jiaojiao drew the corner of her lips up, revealing a mocking smile which soon turned into a calm and indifferent face.She took one step forward and looked into Yan Xingyan\u2019s deep eyes, whispering in the tone only audible to the both of them.\u201cWhat goes on between man and woman should originally be based on mutual consent. Although I was no doubtedly the one who forced you in the beginning, in the end, it was evident that Mr. Yan also took great pleasure from it. In fact, after the first round, it was Mr. Yan who had taken the initiative. Even when I said I didn\u2019t want it any longer, Mr. Yan continued to press me down and do me continuously. Is this not true?\u201dAfter saying this, Ruan Jiaojiao then turned around and left, leaving Yan Xingyan to watch her slender figure with complicated eyes.The system simply wanted to applaud and cheer for its host\u2019s clever impromptu reaction.However, when Ruan Jiaojiao returned to the table, the atmosphere between the two men seemed to have reached freezing point, awkwardness seemed to congeal and the urge to excuse herself to the toilet from this awkwardness arose.Ji Che sent Ruan Jiaojiao home but silence prevailed throughout the whole journey.The car came to a stop and the mentally weary Ruan Jiaojiao pushed the doors open, intending to slip away as soon as possible, however, Ji Che also got out of the car.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to see me off.\u201d Ruan Jiaojiao forced a smile and said.\u201cJiaojiao, can I stay tonight?\u201dWhat?!!Ruan Jiaojiao was extremely taken aback!!Seeing her astonished expression, Ji Che smiled at her and the atmosphere around him became more mellow.\u201cJiaojiao, actually, I have something I want to tell you.\u201dRuan Jiaojiao felt restless bringing Ji Che into her home. Once the door shut closed, her heart also dropped down with a clunk.The male lead wouldn\u2019t be asking her for a dissolution of their engagement right?She had been deliberately evading the male lead in hopes that he would forget about this matter and push it to discuss at a later date.\u201cWhat did you want to talk to me about?\u201dRuan Jiaojiao felt that this situation was too annoying.If she was doomed to die then it was better to make it quick.\u201cIt\u2019s about our engagement.\u201d Ji Che said calmly, the expression on his face indiscernible.Ruan Jiaojiao impatiently complained.\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you to give me a bit more time? Since you already have someone you like, you should at least wait for me to move on as well. Moreover, even if you really did find your true love and you can\u2019t wait to be together, you should at least take in consideration the elders\u2019 reactions\u2026\u201dRuan Jiaojiao rambled on immediately like a machine gun until Ji Che suddenly cupped her face and sealed her chattering lips with his thin lips.\u201cMmm\u2026.\u201dWhat kind of sorcery is this?Could this be the legendary forced kiss used by man to shut a woman up like those written in the books?!!!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Her dainty appearance looked lovely and charming.Ji Che remained calm after being pushed, as though what he had done just now wasn\u2019t out of impulse.In this period of time, he had been coming across Su Xue frequently at different places, connected coincidentally by fate just like their previous reencounters. It was as if the red thread of fate was deeply intertwined around the both of them.However, Ji Che realized that the thumping of his originally restless heart, that previously harbored feelings for Su Xue, no longer beat more with every encounter they had, instead, they beat less, and instead of growing deeper, they only grew fainter.It was as if the memory that seemed like an incomparably delicious dish was placed in front of him, but upon reaching his lips, it was not as delicious as he imagined it to be.Su Xue was still the same Su Xue. The estrangement between them hadn\u2019t dissipated at all with the passage of time. The two of them didn\u2019t suit each other and the longer they stayed with each other, the more this fact would only be highlighted.And so, Ji Che realized that what he felt, was perhaps not reluctance, but regret.The two could never go back to how they were. Even if they tried to force the meal into their mouths, they would only be able to taste a dish that has a different flavor and would be unable to swallow it.Contrary to this, the words spoken on that day made him realize that he didn\u2019t completely understand his fiancee.Previously, he thought the two of them matched but when he heard her say that she was going to start liking another man, he felt faintly discomfited at the thought. Moreover, her increasingly cold attitude towards him only proved that she was truly serious about leaving him.The pain of losing something you once had was greater than the feeling of obtaining something.And tonight, once he saw the sight of her together with his younger brother, Ji Che was deeply affected. Because of this, his strong desire to possess was provoked.After all, she was his fiancee!!Ji Che neared Ruan Jiaojiao and took her into his embrace with one arm. He pressed his thin lips against hers once again and the more he kissed her, the deeper the kiss grew, their breaths turning hot.Ruan Jiaojiao was taken aback. She felt confused as to how the male lead had suddenly gotten aroused and what he was actually trying to do.System: \u201cThe male lead wants to f*ck you!\u201dRuan Jiaojiao was only stunned for a moment and by the time she regained her senses, Ji Che was no longer satisfied with the entanglement of their lips. His scent wrapped around her and his firm arms itched to meld her deep into his body.Moreover, with the two bodies seamlessly fitting close, Ruan Jiaojiao could feel Ji Che\u2019s erect desire poking her legs.Her desire was provoked early on by Ji Xun back in the theater and now, Jie Che\u2019s action was akin to lighting a dry matchstick on fire. He had lit her aflame. Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s eyes started to glaze and turn foggy. She was unable to hold back from moaning softly from Ji Che\u2019s fierce attacks.Now that the male lead had sent himself to her doors, the question she had right now was, to eat or not to eat?Ruan Jiaojiao was a little conflicted, her limbs trying to muster a bit of resistance.The system only felt surprised. In its eyes, its host was extremely immoral. Why was she still able to resist when the piece of meat had delivered itself to her mouth?Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s struggle was like a ladle of water dousing Ji Che\u2019s fire. His eyes darkened as he tried his best to suppress his turbulent feelings. He eased his hold on her, allowing her to easily push him away but she didn\u2019t move. As such, the two people\u2019s bodies stuck close together.\u201cJiaojiao, I want you.\u201d Ji Che\u2019s voice rang out low and magnetic, revealing his restrained and repressed urges.Ruan Jiaojiao smothered herself in his arms, staying silent for a good while until her shoulders started shaking. She sobbed softly and spoke in an aggrieved tone.\u201cJi Che, how could you bully people like this!\u201dJi Che was stumped for words. The more Ruan Jiaojiao cried, the sadder she grew. She wailed and complained.\u201cI know you like Su Xue so I was willing to completely give you up. I\u2019ve already accepted my fate but how can you continue liking someone else while treating me like this!\u201dHearing Ruan Jiaojiao say this, how could Ji Che continue to let his imaginations run wild. He immediately explained with guilt and remorse.\u201cJiaojiao, I\u2026I\u2026.I\u2019m sorry. I got muddled. I don\u2019t feel that way for Su Xue\u2026\u201dRuan Jiaojiao quickly raised her eyes which looked particularly bright due to the tears. Her big black eyes stared straight at his.\u201cHow did that happen? Did you realize that you actually didn\u2019t like her that much and you were also worried about me being taken away by someone else so you wanted to cook the rice while it\u2019s still hot <sup>1</sup> Cook the rice while it\u2019s still hot refers to knocking her up. ?!\u201dJi Che\u2019s eyes brimmed with shock, realizing that his hidden complex thoughts were completely uncovered by Ruan Jiaojiao. He suddenly realized that the person who knew him the most was actually his fiancee whom he didn\u2019t know well at all.Ruan Jiaojiao hooked her lips up in a mocking smile.\u201cJi Che. I\u2019m not that lowly. I\u2019m not something you can just throw whenever you feel like it and want whenever you do! Get the hell out of my face!!\u201dRuan Jiaojiao instantly exploded, pushing Ji Che out and even shutting the door loudly, enough to express her grievance and indignance.When the door shut closed, Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s anger immediately vanished and she spat out the word 'scum\u201d under her breath before plopping down weakly on the sofa.Sigh, acting was such a tiring thing to do for this granny!One had to act accordingly towards men like Ji Che. The more you didn\u2019t give in to their desires, the more their longing would grow for you. That was also the reason why he pined over Su Xue for many years.A few minutes later, someone knocked lightly on her door.The other party didn\u2019t ring the doorbell as if he was giving her a secret signal.Ruan Jiaojiao immediately ran over in excitement and opened the door. Seeing the handsome youth standing outside, her eyes curved and a smile as charming as peaches and plums bloomed on her face. She jumped into the youth\u2019s arms, wrapping her limbs around him like a koala and her ruddy lips pressed against his cold thin lips.\u201cBrother\u2019s car is still downstairs and it looks like he hasn\u2019t gone away yet. Perhaps he\u2019ll come back in a while.\u201dJi Xun said in a relaxed and arrogant tone. His hands held Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s plump rear as they walked further inside the room, With just one leg, he kicked the door shut.\u201cSshh..Don\u2019t talk, just kiss me.\u201dRuan Jiaojiao wrapped her arms around his neck and initiated a fervent French kiss.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You\u2019re the biggest!!!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayPerhaps the thought of Ji Che still being downstairs excited them, or perhaps because they hadn\u2019t had their fill of fun the last time and it came to an abrupt stop.Ji Xun carried Ruan Jiaojiao to the sofa of the living room and the two impatiently entangled with each other.Ji Xun pulled his zippers down and Ruan Jiajiao clamped her legs around his narrow waist. He tore away her little panties, and their genitals met at that moment, the stiff c*ck abruptly invading her tight and wet passage.The two people left no gaps between their bodies, immersed in their rhythmic thrusting while hurriedly taking off their clothes.Ruan Jiaojiao raised her upper body, taking off her T-shirt as she looked into Ji Xun\u2019s lusty eyes. She cupped his face, kissing his lips, before sticking out a warm tongue to lick the teardrop-shaped mole on the corner of his eye.Ji Xun removed his jacket, revealing a white T-shirt which Ruan Jiaojiao took the initiative to peel off of him. She also took this opportunity to stroke his 8 pack abs, fondling them admiringly.Ji Xun felt slightly odd about Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s wandering hands. It was as if this woman was treating him like a male prostitute. And so, he restrained her hands and pressed her down on the sofa.He fiercely thrusted his hip forward, ramming his d*ck into the deepest parts of her flower pot.As he expected, Ruan Jiaojiao let out a low moan. She turned limp and powerless, her soul f*cked out of her body. He maintained this strength and pounded her deeply and heavily over and over again. Quick several thrusts later, the woman underneath him suddenly quivered. Her hole clamping tightly onto his c*ck as if intending to bite it off. This caused a hard-to-resist numbing pleasure to travel up his spine.F*ck!Ji Xun swore under his breath. He originally wanted to f*ck her until she cl*maxed but he didn\u2019t expect to reach his limit on the very first round. Her hole was akin to an endless number of greedy mouths all sucking on his rod firmly. Within just a few strokes, Ji Xun felt as if he was about to ascend to heaven.Ruan Jiaojiao didn\u2019t fare any better than him. Back when she provoked Yan Xingyan, she didn\u2019t think that the scholarly face that appeared warm and caring, was actually just a facade. He had almost f*cked her waist broken, her cave swelling as an aftermath.That was why she had been cultivating her body during this period. She was planning to eat meat today, playing a game of fire with the little brat in the theaters but was suddenly interrupted by Ji Che.Now that she had attained release after enduring to her peak, the pleasure instantly engulfed her, making her body spasm for a while.Youths were always full of vitality. After just a few minutes, while Ruan Jiaojiao was still basking in the after-pleasure, Ji Xun had already started trailing kisses on her nape. His energetic c*ck entered her from behind, feeling the dampness inside, and just like a fish that had attained water, his member slid all the way to the base, pressing against her uterus.\u201cOhh\u2026..\u201dRuan Jiaojiao moaned, the sounds of thrusts interspersed with the sloshing of liquid ringing out.\u201cSister-in-law, you\u2019re leaking so much..\u201d Ji Xun chuckled softly in her ear, his meaning profound.Their little fun on the bed was enough to expose Ji Xun\u2019s nasty taste. His sister-in-law was already calling out incessantly, yet he still insisted on adding fuel to this immoral circumstances. Then again, who was Ruan Jiaojiao? She was someone who liked and chased after excitement, \u00a0her mind already coming up with several porn plots on its own.However, she felt that she was being pleasured much more than the female lead of a porno. Her partners were all good-looking, well-built, high-quality handsome men who thirsty women would kneel over and lick.Ruan Jiaojiao turned around and faced him, the two squeezing in the narrow sofa with their bodies leaving no gaps. She appreciated the view of Ji Xun\u2019s looks and was extremely satisfied with him, pecking his handsome face again and again, leaving a trail of wet kisses on his face.\u201cLittle brother, you\u2019re really good-looking. Sister wants to get f*cked broken by you!\u201dShe gave him the highest praise she thought of.Who would\u2019ve thought that Ji Xun\u2019s face would turn dark in response.Little brother?!This woman dared to call him little?!!He lifted her up, arms coiled around her waist like a python.\u201cLift your butt up.\u201dJi Xun held his big c*ck and positioned it between the peach blossom spring between the girl\u2019s legs, ruthlessly plunging it in.\u201cPa! Pa! Pa!\u201dThe sounds of flesh slapping rang out, Ruan Jiaojiao was pounded so hard, her juices splashed everywhere. Fair white bosoms shook back and forth frantically, popping out of her brassiere.What a savage little wolfdog.Ruan Jiaojiao felt her consciousness slipping away during this intense round of thrusting. Due to the high speed of friction, her hole felt so hot as if it had caught fire. It also ached a little bit. She bit her lip in forbearance, confused as to why he was suddenly having a temper.As Ji Xun played with her roughly, Ruan Jiaojiao let out a low curse. If he continued to f*ck her this aggressively, there were no doubts she was going to be f*cked broken.The taming of a beast relied on skillful words so Ruan Jiaojiao could only soothe its angry fur first.\u201cJi Xun\u2026I was wrong\u2026\u201d She cried out but it was hard to discern whether it was out of pleasure or out of asking for mercy.Ruan Jiaojiao held Ji Xun\u2019s neck and clamped her legs around his waist, sitting up.Ji Xun still had on a dark face. He straightened his waist and rammed her hole deeply, however, because her weight was pressing down on his legs, he certainly wasn\u2019t able to f*ck her as wildly as he did moments ago.\u201cWuuu\u2026\u201dRuan Jiaojiao sobbed quietly in his ear while grinding her soft flaky chest against his firm ones.\u201cCan you do it a little gentler, please? You\u2019re starting to hurt me\u2026what if I start bleeding again?\u201dRuan Jiaojiao grumbled softly but it only sounded coquettish to the ear.Ji Xun remained silent for a while before he suddenly asked.\u201cIs he big or am I bigger?\u201dRuan Jiaojiao was taken aback by this question. Whaaaaat? What was big?Seeing her remain silent, Ji Xun\u2019s anger rose. He leaned forward, pressing her down on the sofa once again and gave her another strong thrust, nearly causing the inattentive Jiaojiao to slide and fall down the couch.She let out an exclaim of surprise, nearly falling headfirst. Fortunately, Ji Xun had grabbed onto her waist.However, now, her upper body floated mid-air, blood rushing towards her head.\u201cQu-quickly pull me up!\u201d Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s arms fluttered as she tried to climb back up.Ji Xun deliberately pounded her once again mischievously, making Ruan Jiaojiao yelp. Her fingers dug deeply into his arm as if she was a drowning person grabbing hold of a lifebuoy in fear of sinking.Motherf*cker! This bastard!!\u201cIs he big or am I bigger?\u201d He once again asked patiently.\u201cYou\u2019re bigger! You\u2019re bigger!! You\u2019re the biggest!!\u201d Ruan Jiaojiao howled in fury.\u201cSay it one more time.\u201d Ji Xun repeated.Ruan Jiao gritted her teeth but the fear of falling as well as the blood rushing to her head made her frightened and uncomfortable, even if the other party wanted to call him granddaddy, she was willing to do it.\u201cYou\u2019re bigger! You\u2019re bigger! You\u2019re the biggest!!!\u201dRuan Jiaojiao howled loudly once more.At this time, a sharp doorbell sounded and the air in the room stilled for a few seconds.With a \u201cthump\u201d, the sound of a body falling down on the ground rang out.In the next second, Ji Xun\u2019s enraged voice was heard.\u201cRuan Jiaojiao, you kicked me again!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She tried her best to suppress her guilty conscience and put on a polite but not awkward smile.\u201cJi Che, I was only playing along with Ji Xun. The one I truly love is you!\u201dSystem: Pft!After saying these words, Ruan Jiaojiao lowered her eyes in gloom and said in a distressed tone.\u201cWe were originally planning to annul our marriage anyway.

Ji Che\u2019s gaze fell on his arm and because he was wearing a T-shirt, his wheat colored skin showed several gashes clearly made by fingernails.They must have had a lot of fun\u2026Provoked, Ji Che suddenly grabbed Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s wrist.\u201cCome with me!\u201dHe coldly spat out three words, intending to pull Ruan Jiaojiao with him and leave.Seeing the man flare up in anger, looking as though he could kill someone, Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s little heart quivered in fear. She didn\u2019t want to die!And so, at this critical juncture, she grabbed the corner of Ji Xun\u2019s clothes while trying to appease Ji Che.\u201cJi Che, you should first calm down. It\u2019s pretty late right now, if you have anything else to say, we\u2019ll talk about it tomorrow.\u201dCalm down?!Ji Che\u2019s bloodthirsty eyes fell on the fingers Ruan Jiaojiao had on Ji Xun\u2019s clothes.Ruan Jiaojiao quivered, unable to help herself from complaining to the system.What\u2019s wrong with the male lead? Did he finally go crazy? I remember in the plot that even if he was angry or jealous at the female lead, he would still maintain the same stone face and shake her hand away, leaving by himself.If he wanted to leave, he can leave by himself. Why did he have to try and drag me off with him!!The system took joy in her suffering and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not as if he caught the female lead in the middle of her adultery.Ruan Jiaojiao turned her head to look at Ji Xun, in the end, the other party used a cold and indifferent gaze to look at her, showing not the slightest intentions of helping.\u201cSister-in-law, what are you looking at me for? You should leave with your true love.\u201d He sarcastically mocked her.Ruan Jiaojiao: \u201c\u2026\u201dMotherfucker!In any case, if one had become husband and wife, their feelings for each other would never diminish throughout the years, I\u2019ve at least slept with you twice, you can\u2019t be so heartless as to burn all the bridges after crossing the river. <sup>1</sup> To burn all bridges after crossing the river means to abandon one\u2019s benefactor upon achieving one\u2019s goalsRuan Jiaojiao\u2019s wrist started to hurt from Ji Che holding it tightly. In a moment of desperation, as though she was left with no other choice, she pointed to Ji Xun as she told Ji Che loudly.\u201cIt was he who forced me in the beginning!! On the day I had an argument with you, he came across the fight and covered my mouth, bringing me into his room, and then\u2026and then\u2026he used this to threaten me. I only wanted to stay by your side, Ji Che\u2026 wuuuuuu\u2026.\u201d She grievously wailed and sobbed.The next day.Ruan Jiaojiao went to the Ji Residence. Within the same room, Ji Che had on a face as cold as ice. She tried to open her mouth several times but ended up swallowing her words down.Nevermind. It was better to eat first.In the end, midway through the meal, Ji Che calmly announced to his family to spread the news that the two were holding the wedding ceremony at the end of the month.Ruan Jiaojiao was rendered stupefied.Had the male lead finally lost a screw in his head?After the meal, the two went up the stairs and Ji Che took Ruan Jiaojiao into his arms.\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026.for hurting you. My younger brother has always been impudent since I was young, always wanting to steal things that were mine, but I didn\u2019t think he would be so vile as to actually make you do such things.\u201dRuan Jiaojiao felt increasingly guilty the more she listened. She threw this basin of dirty water all onto Ji Xun and he had actually accepted all of it.In reality, according to Ji Che\u2019s self-respect as a man, he was more willing to believe in this truth.Even if his fiancee was raped by his younger brother, the one she loved was still him. She merely accepted a compromise, all for the sake of staying by his side, suffering Ji Xun\u2019s tyranny. This was far better than the fact that she had climbed his younger brother\u2019s bed all by herself and was unwilling to become more intimate with him.Ji Che pecked Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s cheek.\u201cWhat happened in the past stays in the past, Jiaojiao. From now on, no matter what happens in the future, I will continue to love and protect you.\u201dWhat Ji Che didn\u2019t expect completely was that, after spending a night getting rid of the grudges in his heart, just as he was about to take Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s hand into his and step into the ceremony hall, he bumped into the scene of Su Xue\u2019s ex-boyfriend forcibly pushing her into his car.Ji Che was worried that because of his relationship with Su Xue, it provoked the other party to take his anger out on Ruan Jiaojiao. And so, he quickly hailed a car to pursue after them.The car stopped at an alley and Ji Che saw that the car still had its doors shut. Worried that the other party may harm Ruan Jiaojiao, he got out of the car to approach them.But then, he heard a girl\u2019s voice ring out from within, along with sounds of panting and an unspeakable ambiguity.\u201cD-Don\u2019t do this\u2026.Wwuuu\u2026It\u2019s too quick\u2026.I can\u2019t take it anymore\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Yan Xingyan\u2019s c*ck was deeply thrusted into the depths of Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s flower pot. His arms were propped on both sides of her body, caging her between him and her seat.Yan Xingyan\u2019s armrest was pushed back and he dropped his waist, going back and forth, his thick and long c*ck completing a ferocious thrust, causing a moan to slip out of Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s lips.It was due to this pure friction of their gen*tals that he felt her hole turning hotter and tighter, bringing him to the verge of ej*culation. Yan Xingyan felt as though he had found the source of his recent unstable feelings.This woman provoked his desire but merely slipped away. He tossed and turned restlessly, unable to help but recall the ecstasy that engulfed him that night. However, it was just like an illusion, it was if he merely dreamed an incredibly lascivious dream.Upon seeing Ji Che announce news of his marriage, by the time Yan Xingyan had recovered his senses, he was already in the car. He wanted to see her and ask. You\u2019ve already done those things with me. How could you still have no qualms on marrying Ji Che?!However, as soon as he pulled her into his car, when the two were alone in a confined space, the other person\u2019s body started emitting a sweet scent. She was merely sitting by his side yet he felt an irresistible lure to her. It was as if he had turned into a beast, the only thoughts running through his mind were to mate with her all day long.And so, Yan Xingyan\u2019s rationality was overcome by his beastly instincts. He parked the car at a remote and secluded alley, lowered the seats and let his inner beast take over, pressing her down beneath him.Ruan Jiaojiao was taken aback for a moment. Under the dim lights, she felt Yan Xingyan\u2019s muscles turn taut, ready to pounce on her any moment, stimulated by desire.In reality, he gave her an opportunity to refuse. Take what had happened minutes ago for example, even if his c*ck was already swollen to the point it was pressing against the base of her legs, and it felt so hard she was unable to ignore it, he still held himself back and didn\u2019t make a move on her.What a good gentleman.Ruan Jiaojiao thought to herself. Even if she was a person with no moral integrity, meeting such a reserved and aloof man was really appetizing. She\u2019s always wanted to rip off his scholarly face and watch him turn into a beast.The system couldn\u2019t help but click its tongue. Have you already forgotten the last time you were f*cked to the point your legs couldn\u2019t even stand anymore?To Ruan Jiajiao, as long as she wanted to do something, she would do it. And so, she raised her head and held Yan Xingyan\u2019s neck, pressing a kiss on the corner of his mouth. Then, she reached her hand to the place where their legs were entangled and unbuckled his belt.To Yan Xingyan, her initiative was like a catalyst. He instantly groped her slender wrist and pushed her down on the chair once again, crashing his thin lips against her soft ones.He lifted his upper body up and quickly pulled down his zipper, releasing his sleeping desire but upon looking into Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s dark misty eyes, he was stupefied.Under the dim yellow lights, a beautiful and delicate face was tinged with the flush of desire, her head of onyx hair was spread on the leather chair, her beauty incited one to wreak havoc.Seeing him look entranced, Ruan Jiaojiao couldn\u2019t help but smile, her lips curling up slightly, looking like a pure and faultless angel morphing into a captivating and tantalizing minx. She stroked her slender fingers on his thick and hot member, her nail scratching the tip.This caused Yan Xingyan\u2019s soul to quiver from the stimulation. What an insatiable minx!She placed the same finger back onto her ruddy lips and gently sucked it, At this, Yan Xingyan\u2019s soul was simply sucked away.He no longer hesitated, tugging away her thin piece of p*nties and gently sliding his member just beside her flower seams.\u201cMmm\u2026\u201dRuan Jiaojiao became aroused by such gentle friction, nearly wishing for a moment that the man would just ram it inside of her but he only kept rubbing it outside. The more he barred her from the pleasure, the more restless she felt, her sensitivity pushed to the peak.\u201cYou meanie!\u201d Her eyes brimmed with tears as she glared at him.Yan Xingyan\u2018s body once again lost all strength from her action but Ruan Jiaojiao shifted her rump forward, using her strength to greedily eat his c*ck into her c*nt. Her hole had already started to secret lascivious liquid so the entrance went quite smoothly. He reached her deepest parts in an instant, making her narrow her eyes in pleasure.But compared to her, having suddenly been stripped off the offensive position, his whole c*ck sucked into her tight honey hole without warning, the unspeakable pleasure and delight nearly made Yan Xingyan unable to snap out of his senses, his body had already moved way ahead of him as he started to thrust strongly.\u201cDon-Don\u2019t be like this\u2026wuuuu..It\u2019s too quick..I can\u2019t hold myself\u2026\u201dRuan Jiaojiao finally saw this man turn into a beast, repeatedly ramming into her deepest parts in a frenzy, making her moan out uncontrollably.Just when the two were enjoying their passionate rendezvous, a knock sounded from the car windows.The two were startled by the sudden sound. Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s hole abruptly clamped on Yan Xingyan\u2019s member, making him nearly cum from the pressure.But even as they finally recovered their senses, the knocks on the car window still continued. Seeing that the people inside the car didn\u2019t respond, the knocks gradually grew louder, making Ruan Jiaojiao only feel pity, thinking that the other person\u2019s hand must have started to ache.Yan Xingyan kissed her on the lips.\u201cDon\u2019t clamp onto me so tightly. Let me pull out first.\u201dRuan Jiaojiao\u2019s face turned beet red, surprised by the man\u2019s crude words despite his scholarly appearance.Once the two bodies had separated, they fixed each other\u2019s clothes. In reality, Ruan Jiaojiao didn\u2019t need to fix hers that much. She had worn a skirt so even if her underwear had been taken off, once the skirt was settled down, one wouldn\u2019t be able to find any traces left behind.As for Yan Xingyan, he had pulled the zippers of his pants up and buckled his belt back, appearing prim and proper.The person outside the window seemed to have reached the limit of his patience as he finally howled loudly.\u201cRuan Jiaojiao!!\u201dUpon hearing this cold and deep voice, yet with a taut timber, it felt as if Ruan Jiaojiao was soon going to be swept awat in terrifying waves.As expected!Ruan Jiaojiao cursed her bad luck. She was caught red-handed again.But the problem was, she felt that the system should\u2019ve known this was going to happen, yet it merely watched wide-eyed as she drowned in the quicksand consequences of her action.This stupid douchebag of a system!Hearing Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s curse, the system chuckled wretchedly.\u201cI did this in hopes that you learn deep in your bones that lascivious activities lead to bitter consequences. In order to cultivate host\u2019s moral character, I had given this a lot of thought!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If they drove away, they would only seem guilty and this wouldn\u2019t be too good.Yan Xingyan evidently respected her thoughts and asked her calmly what they should do.However, Ruan Jiaojiao merely pushed the doors open and directly got off the car, making him raise a brow.Just as he was about to get off the car in concern for what Ji Che may do to her, Ruan Jiaojiao spoke out.\u201cDon\u2019t come out, I\u2019ll explain to him what\u2019s going on myself!\u201dThen, she coolly shut the door with a \u201cbang\u201d.Yan Xingyan: \u201c\u2026\u201dJi Che looked like he was completely surrounded by dark clouds, his face was extremely gloomy as if he could completely blend into the darkness.Ruan Jiaojiao had a calm expression on. There was not a tinge of the fluster and alarm one should have upon being caught red-handed by her fiance, present on her face. She was like this the last time as well. That was how she had been able to easily dupe him.The two people confronting each other remained silent for a long while, but in reality, Ji Che was trying his best to restrain himself from strangling this woman to death.\u201cWhy?\u201c He lightly spat out this one word.Ruan Jiaojiao didn\u2019t step back in the slightest, fixating her eyes straight into his, as if to pierce through his heart.\u201cBecause I hate you.\u201d She hooked her lips up into a cruel and mocking cold smile.This response was evidently out of Ji Che\u2019s expectation, making his person quiver.Ruan Jiaojiao mercilessly continued.\u201cIn the beginning, the engagement was done out of mutual consent. It was not I who held a knife against your neck, forcing you to marry me. In the end, you encountered your first love and reawakened your unforgettable feelings. You ate in my bowl while looking at another pot <sup>1</sup> To eat in a bowl while looking at another pot means to be greedy and insatiable without the slightest concern for my face and social reputation. I really want to ask you, what did you treat me as? Did you think you were the only man under the skies? Did you think I wouldn\u2019t be able to live without you?!\u201dShe was overbearing and imperious, her tone extremely sharp like knives stabbing into his heart.Bitter resentment and hatred clearly seen in her gaze and tone.\u201cI hate you. I wanted to take revenge against you so I slept with your brother! I also hated Su Xue. She stole the man I love so I slept with her man! Isn\u2019t this only fair? You were the one who forced me to turn into this!!\u201dThe last few words had turned into howls, carrying a delight from finally letting out her long-suppressed feelings despite having shed off all pretense of cordiality, turning everything upside down and drenching everything in blood.A \u201cpa\u201d sound rang out and Ruan Jiaojiao suffered a crisp-sounding slap.Ruan Jiaojiao was taken aback, her left cheek feeling a searing hot pain.She looked at the woman who suddenly rushed towards her with an enraged look on her face, and couldn\u2019t help but let out a string of curses.F*ck! System, you dug me another pit again! Why is the female lead here?!!\u201cYou lowly wh*re!\u201dSu Xue looked as though she was seething with anger, her eyes were completely red as she cursed without holding back.Ji Che was also taken aback by Su Xue\u2019s sudden appearance, however, that did not end there. Two resounding slaps once again rendered him speechless.He looked at the two women who were engaged in a fight, his figure stuck in place.All Ruan Jiaojiao could think about was that she had actually been slapped\u2026..she had been slapped\u2026And so, when Su Xue was cursing at her, she quickly struck back, hitting her face twice so quickly her hand had hurt.One of Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s principles was that she never held grudges. If she did, she would settle them on the spot. She was the type of person to seek revenge for the slightest grievance. That was why when Su Xue slapped her once, she returned it two-folds.Su Xue went mad after getting hit. She couldn\u2019t discern whether she was furious because Ruan Jiaojiao had slept with Yan Xingyan or because Ji Che was actually going to marry her.She was so furious, she gritted her teeth, unconcerned with appearances. The only thing raging in her head was to teach this b*tch a lesson by scratching her face.However, never did she expect that this woman would be so strong. She simply couldn\u2019t win against her!At this time, Ji Che had yet to react when Yan Xingyan got off the car and tried to pry the two girls apart.Ji Che soon regained his senses and each of the men held one of the ladies, finally separating them apart. However, Ji Che\u2019s face was ruthlessly scratched by the raging Su Xue, the bloody gashes on his handsome face were extremely apparent.At this moment, the male lead only felt mentally exhausted.As the person who was more advantageous in terms of strength, having been victorious in the fight, hence, was able to keep her rationality, Ruan Jiaojiao stopped any further actions the moment Yan Xingyan pulled her away.Su Xue had really gone insane. She kept brandishing her claws and spitting out curses despite being held back by Ji Che, filthy words like \u2018sk*nk\u2019 and \u2018wh*re\u2019 continuously flowing out of her mouth.However, perhaps because she rarely cursed people, she soon ran out of words.But despite this, the two men who previously dated her felt a bit stunned, seeing her shrewd side.Seeing the female lead\u2019s seemingly deranged appearance, Ruan Jiaojiao thought to herself, she was nearly done with her job. With this, if the male and female lead were still able to rekindle their love, she could only praise the plot for being too strong.Having played two completely different personalities, Ruan Jiaojiao felt quite tired. She placed an arm around Yan Xingyan\u2019s waist, pressing most of her weight onto him. And like a weak and helpless person, she lazily said.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dYan Xingyan didn\u2019t move, so Ruan Jiaojiao loosened her arm around his waist and lifted her head to look at him.\u201cIf you want to remain and make good with your ex-girlfriend, then I\u2019m leaving. I was even originally planning to go visit your home.\u201dYan Xingyan cast a glance at Su Xue who was sobbing aggrievedly in Ji Che\u2019s arms and decisively held Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s hand.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dThe two people were just about to leave when Ji Che suddenly called out anxiously.\u201cJiaojiao\u2026\u201dRuan Jiajiao didn\u2019t even turn her head, leaving behind merely a single sentence\u201cCongratulations for getting back together. I wish you both all the best.\u201dEven though she said these words to the male and female lead, when Ruan Jiaojiao had learnt that Ji Che was proceeding with the marriage as planned and the bride had been swapped to Su Xue, it was as if she was struck by lightning, she heard the system\u2019s sneeringly delighted voice saying.\u201cYou got what you wanted, didn\u2019t you? Do you feel stupid now? This is karma, isn\u2019t it? Lalalalala~\u201dMotherfucker!!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 39": "Chapter 39 [2nd World 17] Is the male lead blackening?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayRuan Jiaojiao immediately called Ji Xun to ask what was going on but was hung up on.Looks like the little brat was still angry at her.Che! Petty brat!Ruan Jiaojiao quickly calmed down from anger, mulling over all the signs that showed Ji Che still had feelings for her, especially that abnormal state he showed the night at the alley, since that was how she was able to confidently walk away with Yan Xingyan.In the end, she didn\u2019t think she would be slapped by reality in the face. Looks like arrogant people really were struck by lightning.As long as Ji Che had the slightest feelings for her, the matter would prove easy to handle and breaking the male and female lead\u2019s joyous occasion would also go smoothly.Seeing Ruan Jiaojiao look like she had a card up her sleeve, the system curiously asked.\u201cWhat are you planning to do?\u201d\u201cThe simplest and crudest method!\u201d Ruan Jiaojiao responded.\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d The system asked as it had a flashback of her carrying out rape previously, feeling faintly excited.\u201cWhy are you so unimaginative?\u2019 Ruan Jiaojiao mocked.System: \u201c\u2026.\u201dUnlike the previous world, Ruan Jiaojiao didn\u2019t want to sleep with the male lead.She disdained Ji Che\u2019s act of eating in her bowl while looking at another pot. She had already labelled him as a scum. Even if he was a feast for the eyes, she did not want to sample him at all.Even though she was a slut, she still had her own principles!\u201cThen, how do you plan to destroy them?\u201dRuan Jiaojiao exposed a sinister smile.\u201cBy throwing on a show!\u201dIf the male lead married the female lead, she\u2019d kill herself for him to see.After settling the details of her strategy, Ruan Jiaojiao no longer felt anxious. She ate, drank and slept whenever she wanted. However, the same could not be said for the Ruan Family. The Ruan Family felt anxious. They clearly announced the wedding a few days ago, how could the Ji Family suddenly switch the bride out?When the Ruan members were asking Ruan Jiaojiao about this matter, she learnt that for the sake of persevering his face, he didn\u2019t reveal anything to the outside. Hence, in the eyes of outsiders, she was a fiancee who was abandoned, a poor pitiful woman.This development coincidentally overlapped with the plot in the original story.The only difference was that, Ji Che and Su Xue didn\u2019t go through many twists and turns before they ended up together. As the malicious supporting female, she also didn\u2019t scheme to harm them. The two were to be wed without any warning so they also didn\u2019t receive universal blessings.Su Xue was acknowledged as the mistress who had ripped a perfectly happy couple apart and Ji Che was labelled as a heartless two-timer.What Ruan Jiaojiao was curious about was that, Su Xue was proud and arrogant, leading to her breaking up with Ji Che back in the past. Why was she now willing to bear these unseemly abuses and criticisms?\u201cIt\u2019s very simple. It\u2019s because she wants Ji Che.\u201dThe system was kind enough to clear her doubts this time around, opening up a God\u2019s viewpoint.\u201cJi Che is a fickle-minded scum of a man who also doesn\u2019t want to let others know he\u2019d been cheated on by his fiance. Su Xue loves Ji Che, that was why she was willing to accept these for the sake of marrying him.\u201d\u201cSo after all this time, I still ended up playing matchmaker for them?\u201d Ruan Jiaojiao sighed.If she hadn\u2019t left with Yan Xingyan at that time, preventing the male and female lead from licking each other\u2019s wounds alone, perhaps, this reversal wouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201cFocus.\u201dJust as Ruan Jiaojiao was conversing with the system, a man\u2019s voice tinged with a hint of dissatisfaction rang above her head, followed by a \u201cpa!\u201d sound, a palm slapping her supple bottom gently, making the fair meat jiggle.Ruan Jiaojiao turned around to take a look at the person behind her.Tsk tsk. This man has really been completely corrupted. Besides, they were currently doing it doggy-style, how did he know she was zoning out when he couldn\u2019t even see her expression?That\u2019s right. These past few days, Ruan Jiaojiao ate, drank and slept with whichever handsome hunk she wanted at any time.Once Yan Xingyan was finally enlightened during their car sex, he became particularly appetizing to her. His figure was also very good so the two spent so much time together, trying out all different kinds of positions.Then again, eating too much meat would cause you to become easily tired of it.Ruan Jiaojiao yawned, provoking Yan Xingyan\u2019s unhappiness even more. He lifted her up so the two were face to face and rammed into her deeply.\u201cI\u2019m tired.\u201d Ruan Jiaojiao hooked her arms around his neck, lazily leaning her face on top of his shoulder.Yan Xingyan pursed his lips and did not speak, the sounds of flesh slapping reverberated in the room.\u201cYour ex-girlfriend is about to get married, don\u2019t you have anything to say?\u201dRuan Jiaojiao mischievously and deliberately brought up this unhappy topic.She didn\u2019t expect, however, that Yan Xiongyan would just heavily pound her and kiss her on the lips, sweeping his tongue around her mouth and seeing that her lips had turned red and swollen, he pecked them once again and said with a trace of mirth.\u201cThat\u2019s why, in order to keep my heart calm, I\u2019m doing my best to take revenge.\u201dRuan Jiaojiao was taken aback before soon reacting. Yan Xingyan was reusing the same words she had used to provoke Ji Che to respond back to her.Ugh\u2026Every one of them sure ain\u2019t easy to deal with.****\u201cJi Che. I want to talk with you.\u201dRuan Jiaojiao had just blocked Ji Che at the parking lot but didn\u2019t expect Su Xue to suddenly show up.Was this female lead a ghost? How did she always suddenly pop out of nowhere?Su Xue gave her a death-glare, looking like a soldier who was determined to protect her own territory but before Ruan Jiaojiao could even speak, a man\u2019s light chuckle suddenly rang out.\u201cWhat a great show this is.\u201dThe three people simultaneously turned to look at the source of the sound and came across Ji Xun languidly leaning against a jeep at the corner. A stick of cigarette was in between his long index finger and middle finger, the light of the cigarette flickering.This picture pierced Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s heart. This kind of unrestrained and unbridled bad boy look made her feel like prostrating herself beneath him.Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s smitten expression fell into Ji Che\u2019s eyes and his pupils turned dark like the night. His body emitted a terrifyingly cold air that Su Xue who was standing beside him, even shivered.Ji Che had been kind of scary, gloomy and cold these past few days. He didn\u2019t have the slightest hint of smile on his face. They were clearly about to get married but he hadn\u2019t made the slightest intimate move towards her at all. Su Xue then realized that the reason why Ji Che was marrying her was because he was provoked by this woman.Then again, so what?She believed that Ji Che was only being confused by Ruan Jiaojiao for a period of time. The one he truly loved was her. Those unforgettable and irreplaceable memories would return once the two rekindle their love because she still clearly occupied a space in his heart.Su Xue\u2019s fingers held onto Ji Che\u2019s sleeve tightly, confident of her own thoughts. She was going to protect her love.This shameless whore. Apart from coming from a rich family, what else did she have? She not only was previously engaged to Ji Che, she had even slept with Yan Xingyan.Recalling her ex-boyfriend, Su Xue couldn\u2019t help but feel a pang of disgust and regret. She originally felt a bit guilty towards Yan Xingyan for being so half-hearted, but she didn\u2019t think that Yan Xingyan would break up with her because of this woman.Seeing that the atmosphere didn\u2019t look right, Ruan Jiaojiao cleverly decided to take off.Who could\u2019ve expected that once Ji Che saw her prepare to leave, he actually flung Su Xue away and took big strides towards her.This attitude of his made it look like the two had switched personalities\u2026Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s neck turned taut as she lifted her head to stare at Ji Che standing in front of her. His gaze was ice-cold, looking as though it could envelop her in darkness.She had the urge to flee in fright, afraid that Ji Che would hit her.\u201cSystem, help!

Since he asked, she\u2019ll just try squeezing out some tears to put up a play. In any case, she was still hiding a trump card under her sleeve.As such, she gazed at Ji Che with a pitiful look, her eyes instantly brimming with tears, reflecting a watery glow. Hardening her skin, she reached out both arms, holding onto Ji Che, and with a mournful voice, she pleaded softly.\u201cDon\u2019t marry her, please?\u201d\u201cJi Che!!\u201d Su Xue\u2019s voice turned sharp and alarmed.Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s arms intertwined around Ji Che\u2019s in a vice grip, burying her face into his arms as she sobbed and pleaded.\u201cI beg of you\u2026I know I was wrong\u2026I was blinded by anger so I wanted to take revenge on you\u2026I won\u2019t ask for your forgiveness\u2026I only wanted to stop you from marrying her\u2026Ji Che\u2026don\u2019t marry her\u2026I will die\u2026I will really die\u2026\u201dShe sobbed, her voice getting increasingly lower, and sounding more desperate.Ruan Jiaojiao was extremely engrossed in her acting when her chin was suddenly pinched and lifted by two fingers, making her look into Ji Che\u2019s pitch black eyes, and her delicate body was unable to help but quiver.She was gonna die!She felt that the male lead had really blackened as even when she was crying so pitifully, he kept an expressionless face\u2026Seeing this, even if Su Xue harbored fears towards Ji Che, she couldn\u2019t bear the situation any longer. She rushed towards the two but was unexpectedly knocked unconscious by Ji Xun from behind.\u201cContinue.\u201dJi Xun raised a brow at Ruan Jiaojiao, hooking his lips into a small smile despite his eyes containing no mirth but a slight chill instead, the mole on the corner of his eyes looking slightly sinister.Ruan Jiaojiao couldn\u2019t help but shiver.Ugh..Seeing this reaction of his, did she really have to continue playing this character?Ruan Jiaojiao put away her crying face.\u201cJi Che. If you really dare to marry Su Xue, you\u2019re going to force me to death!\u201dSeeing that crying had been ineffective, she immediately changed strategies and started to spout ferocious words.Unexpectedly, the male lead she was holding onto, finally had a reaction, however, his words made a shiver crawl up her spine.\u201cI never had any plans to marry her.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s hair stood on end, feeling Ji Che\u2019s hand stroking her head.\u201cJiaojiao, nobody has ever provoked my anger like you did.\u201dSensing danger, Ruan Jiaojiao loosened her hold on him and intended to escape, however, Ji Che caught a firm grip of her wrist and the strength he exerted felt like he was about to crush her bones.\u201cIt hurts\u2026Ji Che, let go of me\u2026\u201dShe quickly asked the other man for help but didn\u2019t think that Ji Xun would only turn his lighter on, casting her an indifferent glance before lighting up the cigarette in between his lips.F*ck!Did these pair of brothers forget their previous grudge? Were they both in on this?However, the problem was, as the target of their plans, Ruan Jiaojiao did not feel the least comforted.It looks like she had really caught herself in deep waters this time and it was game over for her!Translator Little Potato has something to say:Hey everyone!

Ji Xun\u2019s actions were swift as though he was proficient in this field.Following this, she stared dumbstruck as Ji Che cast away the female lead, Su Xue, and left her unconscious in the parking lot as though she was just a used prop, discarding it upon achieving his purpose.\u201cDearest sister-in-law, say, how do you think we should punish you for playing us brothers in circles, hm?\u201dJi Xun and her sat at the back whereas Ji Che drove the car. His arm was propped on top of her head and he was casting her side glances. His pupils shone with a sinister light, making his handsome face look threatening.Ruan Jiaojiao shook her head, her eyes brimming with innocence and puzzlement.Nonono! Not like this! This is a misunderstanding! Let me explain!!As though Ji Xun understood her words implicitly, he took the towel stuffed in her mouth away.\u201cSpeak. I\u2019ll hear out your explanation.\u201dRuan Jiaojiao was taken aback.Fuck! This granny hasn\u2019t finished acting out her play, can you stop breaking out of character!!She quickly weighed her current circumstances. It was clear that the two brothers had reached some kind of alliance so if she didn\u2019t reconsider her present situation, not letting Ji Che marry Su Xue was still her goal.As such, Ruan Jiaojiao earnestly told Ji Che.\u201cI was indeed lying about what happened between me and Ji Xun, but I wasn\u2019t lying when I said I love you. Taking revenge on you was also real.\u201dAfter saying this, she pursed her lips, remaining silent.She felt that Ji Che wouldn\u2019t have blackened without any cause at all. Even though he was very angry that night at the alley, his actions and bearing were still considered normal.But now, there was no mistake he was clearly involved in setting up this kidnapping!Ruan Jiaojiao cast Ji Xun a glance and saw him put on a pondering expression. Compared with Ji Che\u2019s gloomy and cold face, this hoe was clearly taking delight in the situation.\u201cOh sister-in-law. If you say it like that, then your way of expressing love is truly unique.\u201dRuan Jiaojiao\u2019s anger simmered at the ridicule in Ju Xun\u2019s words.\u201cWomen who can provoke a mixture of love and hate are just that special.\u201dJi Xun was immediately rendered speechless.The screeching sound of brakes rang out and Ruan Jiajiao who was caught unguarded as well as had both hands bound, was unable to maintain balance, her body falling forward.Fortunately, Ju Xun was sharp-sighted and nimble, immediately grabbing a hold of her on time.It was just that, his palm had coincidentally caught a soft part of her body so after the car came to a stable stop, he deliberately groped it.Ruan Jiaojiao cast him a furious gaze.\u201cYou stinky pervert!\u201dSeeing her expression, Ji Xun couldn\u2019t help but chuckle.\u201cWhat are you pretending to be pure for? You were feeling good when I was fucking you and I even groped your chest several times.\u201dRuan Jiaojiao couldn\u2019t continue putting on an act any longer. Instead, she put on an expression of despair and whispered.\u201cThat\u2019s because I imagined you were Ji Che\u2026\u201dJi Xun was evidently provoked, grabbing her face.\u201cIf you dare to, say that again!\u201dRuan Jiaojiao was scared by his sudden action. She gritted her teeth and set her heart straight, repeating her words.\u201cI merely treated you as a substitute for Ji Che.\u201d\u201cThen what about Yan Xingyan?\u201dJi Che who was sitting in the front without anyone in the passenger, suddenly interjected.\u201cRevenge on Su Xue for taking you away.\u201dA flash of resentment flitted across Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s face at an apt moment whereas a confused and conflicted look surfaced on Ji Che\u2019s.\u201cHeh\u2026\u201d Ji Xun sneered coldly.\u201cLet go of me, Ji Xun. I don\u2019t want you anymore.\u201d Ruan Jiaojiao struggled in Ji Xun\u2019s arms.\u201cBrother, let go of her.\u201d Ji Che looked as if he had been swayed.\u201cJi Che, you fool. You\u2019re being deceived by her flowery words again!\u201d Ji Xun bit back.\u201cI said let go of her!\u201d Ji Che\u2019s anger was also provoked.Seeing the brothers on the verge of breaking into a fight, Ruan Jiaojiao watched the fires burn across the river <sup>1</sup> To delay entering the fray until all others have been exhausted by fighting amongst themselves and thought to herself, \u2018Hmph. You\u2019re a little too green to compete with this granny.\u2019However, in the next second, the triumphant smile on her was immediately wiped clean.Ji Xun gave Ji Che a punch and knocked him out, his body lying limp on the passenger side.Fuck!Male lead, I didn\u2019t think you were this weak. Was she really in the right story?!!Facing the Ji Che she had successfully provoked, Ruan Jiaojiao couldn\u2019t help but quiver like a quail.Young man, please calm down and don\u2019t make any rash actions!We can surely talk this out, just let me explain myself!!When Ji Xun\u2019s hand grabbed a hold of her chin, Ruan Jiaojiao immediately cooperated and blinked her watery eyes, her pretty little face rubbing against the back of his hand.\u201cThe truth is, I was only deceiving him!\u201dJi Xun\u2019s actions came to a stop and he raised a brow.\u201cHm?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never treated you as a substitute for your brother, you\u2019re not the least bit alike at all! Moreover, remember the day I refused to see your brother just to be with you! Ji Xun!! Don\u2019t get angry, I only wanted my revenge to be complete, and make Ji Che harbor doubts about marrying Su Xue.\u201dJi Xun hooked his lips up.\u201cHow do I know you\u2019re not deceiving me now?\u201dRuan Jiaojiao knew that Ji Xun was not easy to fool. This brat had a belly full of evil tricks so she decided to use a honey trap.\u201cJi Xun, I\u2019ll have you know that you were my first time.\u201dShe lowered her eyes and bit her lips, saying this with difficulty, her tone revealing a tinge of shame. She then lifted her bound hands up slowly before dropping them so that they were circled around Ji Xun\u2019s neck, and she slowly neared his face, kissing Ji Xun\u2019s thin lips.He didn\u2019t push her away but he also didn\u2019t stop her from going further.And so, the more Ruan Jiaojiao kissed him, the deeper she went, prying his teeth open with her little tongue and nimbly exploring his mouth. She leaned her body forward, pressing her upper body on his, and the pair of soft, flaky bunnies pressed firmly against his chest, rubbing at times along with her movement.A fire was soon lit in Ji Xun\u2019s belly from her kissing and grinding.\u201cMmmm\u2026\u201dMotherfucker!! That hurt!!Tears were about to flow out of Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s eyes as Ji Xun had actually bitten her.Once bitten twice shy, she quickly wanted to retreat but Ji Xun pressed the back of her head firmly. Snow white teeth gnawed and nibbled on her lips until they tasted the salty and bitter taste of blood. He then stuck his tongue into her mouth, feeling insatiated, and explored it as though he was sampling a fine delicacy.\u201cJiaojiao\u2026\u201d He murmured in between her lips.Ruan Jiaojiao was taken aback. This was the first time Ji Xun had uttered her name. Previously, he always called her name with a tinge of frivolity or licentiousness. At present, it carried the affection and ambiguity only lovers had.However, before she could even ponder over this, her chin had been pinched ruthlessly, the bone feeling slight pain.\u201cOww\u2026\u201d Ruan Jiaojiao squinted her eyes and hummed, complaining to him without any reservations.\u201cIf you fool me again, I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d He threatened.Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s petite body quivered. This brat actually dared to threaten her?!She opened her eyes slightly, looking into his that was brimming with complexity and the depths of his eyes hid a cold and dark evil that really made her shiver.Fortunately, Ji Xun didn\u2019t look as though he was waiting for her response and leaned forward, pressing her down on the car seat. His fingers travelled up between her legs, fumbling for her flower core and interchanged between pressing it and rubbing it, arousing Ruan Jiaojiao to let out a sensitive mewl.The atmosphere quickly turned steamy as she immediately used her bound hands to undo his belt. As the sound of his denim jean zippers rang out, Ji Xun\u2019s cock had already pitched a tent with his underwear, making Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s flower cave wet, an itch arising inside, the only thought in her head being that she wanted to quickly join bodies with him.\u201cUndo my ropes.\u201dRuan Jiaojiao presented her hands to Ji Xun and signaled for him to loosen them, but she didn\u2019t expect him to respond with an evil smile and lift her bound hands up.\u201cLet\u2019s do it like this.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The tips of her mounds were promptly taken in by \u00a0a warm cavity, making her moan out sensitively and her legs started to rub against each other. The licentious brat who stuck his head inside her clothes, reached his hand into her underwear, sticking one finger into her flower cave without obstructions and skillfully thrusting back and forth, making her body spasm.As Ji Xun continued to finger her, her body turned limp and her mouth kept producing moans. However, as she shifted her sight elsewhere inadvertently, she was met with a pair of dark and profound eyes as though she had come face to face with a beast who lived secluded deep in the forests, a shiver immediately running down Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s spine.Ruan Jiaojiao quickly tried to push Ji Xun who was sucking on her teat away but was bitten back in dissatisfaction.Ouch! You stinky brat!!Ruan Jiaojiao realized that Ji Che had already awakened at some point in time and was even watching their passionate affair. This was too exciting!\u201cStop and get out of there!! Your brother\u2019s awake!!!\u201dRuan Jiaojiao pushed Ji Xun away and couldn\u2019t hold herself from roaring at him lowly. Ji Xun finally stopped his actions and slowly took his head out of her clothes.\u201cIf he\u2019s awake then he\u2019s awake. What are you panicking for?\u201dHe calmly looked at Ji Che.\u201cBrother, I want this woman.\u201d Ji Xun said, holding Ruan Jiaojiao in his arms as though he was proclaiming sovereignty.Ruan Jiaojiao: \u201c\u2026.\u201dFacepalm! How was she supposed to act in this circumstance now?The heavens seemed to have heard of Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s inner turmoil as the sirens of a police car rang out.The reason why Ji Che had stepped on the breaks earlier was because there was a car accident ahead on the road. Now that the traffic police had come to settle the matter and the ambulance had also arrived, the area had become bustling and lively.However, inside the car, only the sounds of three people breathing could be heard.Once the traffic police settled the matter of the car accident in front of them, they unblocked the road and signaled for them to start driving.At this moment, Ruan Jiaojiao made her resolve and shouted at the police.\u201cHelp! I\u2019m being kidnapped!!\u201dJi Che and Ji Xun: \u201c\u2026\u201dBy the time Yan Xingyan had rushed to the police station, Ruan Jiaojiao had a jacket draped around her, her eyes were lowered as she sat at the corner without making a sound.She had just finished her statement whereas Ji Che and Ji Xun were now taken for interrogation.Seeing Yan Xingyan arrive, Ruan Jiaojiao immediately stood up and threw herself into his arms.As though she had received a shock, her face was pale and her eyes were distraught. Yan Xingyan\u2019s arms around her tightened.\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid. With me right here, no one would dare hurt you.\u201d\u201cEn.\u201dIt was as if Ruan Jiaojiao had found a safe harbor to rely on, all the way until they left the police station, her face was buried in Yan Xingyan\u2019s arms without lifting once.Half an hour later, the Ji Family lawyer bailed the Ji brothers out of the police station.Upon seeing Ji Che come out, Su Xue immediately ran forward with a heartbroken face. She appeared as if she wanted to say something but as they were in a public place, she ended up holding herself back.She woke up on the cold hard ground of the parking lot and saw that her surroundings were \u00a0completely empty without a soul in sight.The smart Su Xue immediately came to a realization. Ji Che had chosen to forget about her, discarding her once he had finished using her.And now, that woman sent Ji Che to the police station. How ironic.Su Xue didn\u2019t feel the least bit happy. She had just seen her ex-boyfriend leave with that woman in his arms and his warm and pitiful gaze was fixated on the woman from start to end, paying no notice to her at all.Once Ji Che had come out of the police station, he merely said one word to Su Xue.\u201cSorry.\u201dSu Xue wore a bitter smile, feeling her heart sour as though something was stuck in her throat. How could she blame him for what happened?Back then, she was the one who brought up the matter of breaking up. When they crossed paths once again, and realized that he may perhaps still love her, she felt immeasurably proud of herself, her ego boosted. Even though the man already had a fiancee, Su Xue did not care. The two of them were each other\u2019s first loves after all. It was such a wonderful feeling.And so, she had waited. She waited for Ji Che to take the initiative to ask her to get back together.Was this retribution?Retribution for her indecisiveness? She clearly loved Ji Che, yet she couldn\u2019t leave Yan Xingyan\u2019s warmth and consideration. Harboring both feelings, she wavered and ended up not being able to make a decision.In the end, both sides turned up empty.That night, Su Xue packed up her luggage. For the sake of preserving the very last of her dignity, she took a plane and flew to a different country.Hearing the system tell her about this piece of news, Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s eyes immediately lit up.The female lead was gone!!She got out of bed and quickly put on her clothes, preparing to leave when a voice came from behind her.\u201cWhere are you going?\u201dRuan Jiaojiao turned her head and was confronted with Yan Xingyan\u2019s clear eyes. She immediately propped one knee on the bed and cupped his face, pecking him on the lips.\u201cI remembered I have some things to attend to. I\u2019m swinging by my house for a while.\u201d\u201cWhat things? I\u2019ll drive you there.\u201dFor some inexplicable reason, Yan Xingyan had an odd feeling. He felt as though if he let the woman leave right now, she would never come back. As such, he acted out of character and continued asking her questions.Ruan Jiaojiao originally wanted to refuse but seeing Yan Xingyan\u2019s expression, she could only change her mind and agree.On the road, Yan Xingyan suddenly asked.\u201cJiaojiao, let\u2019s start dating.\u201dRuan Jiaojiao naturally couldn\u2019t agree. The only thing she could think of right now was to leave this place as soon as possible. She had completely played with the brothers from the Ji Family. If they come knocking on their door, she wouldn\u2019t be able to continue putting up an act any longer.However, in front of Yan Xingyan, the only man she had a good impression on, she thought for a moment before softly refusing.\u201cYan Xingyan, you are a good man, but I am not a good woman. I\u2019m not suited for you.\u201dYan Xingyan\u2019s fingers gripped the steering wheel tight, and he feigned a light chuckle.\u201cHave I just been friendzoned?\u201d\u201cNo. I\u2019m telling the truth.\u201dThe two people no longer spoke after this exchange, an awkward silence taking over.When they reached her residence, Ruan Jiaojiao got out of the car. Just as she was about to head upstairs, Yan Xingyan caught up to her and hugged her from behind.F*ck!This granny\u2019s young heart was about to be swayed by this back-hug. Ruan Jiaojiao suddenly felt a bit reluctant.\u201cYou\u2019ve been back-hugged so many times, but I\u2019ve never seen you turn so reluctant. Did your heart turn soft from just one back hug?\u201dRuan Jiaojiao bit back.\u201cWhat does a broken system like you know? Haven\u2019t you ever heard of the dagger known as warmth?\u201dEven though she liked fresh meat, it was hard for her to reject warm guys. Otherwise, why else would the female lead indulge in the second male lead\u2019s warmth, unable to extricate herself, and act like a fickle-minded b*ch.Yan Xingyan hugged Ruan Jiaojiao and sighed lightly, his warm breath blowing her neck, making it itch slightly, turning her body soft.How about\u2026We have break-up s*x?By the time Ruan Jiaojiao recovered her senses, she was already entangled in a kiss with Yan Xingyan, entering the lift then going out the lift. Yan Xingyan\u2019s overwhelmingly affectionate kiss turned her whole body limp. As she pressed her finger against the fingerprint lock, the two people entered the room, and impatiently ripped each other\u2019s clothes off.However, a click sound rang out and the dark room was immediately filled with light.She blinked her eyes as two pairs of slender legs walked towards the two.Ruan Jiaojiao looked up following the end of the leg and was met with the gloomy eyes of the brothers, Ji Che and Ji Xun.Holy shit!Not only were they capable of kidnapping, they even trespassed her own residence!!Without any explanation, Ji Xun delivered a punch to Yan Xingyan, quickly and ruthlessly, knocking him out.Ji Xun then reached an arm out as Ji Che handed him a rope.At this moment, seeing this scene, Ruan Jiaojiao was truly frightened, losing all strength in her legs.Me after translating this chapter: *holds temple* Why did I pick this up again?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Since she wasn\u2019t even afraid of death, why should she be afraid of her current predicament?\u2019Worst comes to worst, she\u2019ll only be r*ped and then killed and then r*ped again.System: \u201cHost\u2019s mind is truly filled with useless perverted fantasies.\u201dRuan Jiaojiao was too lazy to concern herself with the system who has never provided anything but mockery. She straightened her spine and walked over, plopping her butt down on the sofa.The position Ji Xun pointed to was coincidentally wedged in between him and Ji Che. The two people appeared to pressure her from both sides.\u201cWhat are you guys trying to do? I wasn\u2019t lying at the police station. It was you guys who kidnapped me from the start.\u201dShe cast a surreptitious glance at Yan Xingyan and seeing the hands tied behind his back making minute movements, she quickly retracted her gaze and looked towards Ji Che.\u201cJi Che. I\u2019ll be honest with you. I had a good impression of you before but I couldn\u2019t stand seeing your fickle-mindedness. I didn\u2019t like how you can easily discard me so all the words I said after were to deceive you.\u201dSu Xue had already gone so Ruan Jiaojiao felt that she had accomplished her mission and would be able to leave this place soon. As such, with an unfettered attitude, she no longer put up an act in front of the male lead.Hearing her words, though Ji Che remained expressionless, his dark eyes appeared to be harboring a brewing storm, as though troubles were approaching ahead.Ruan Jiaojiao resolved to put up a steel front, and so she turned to Ji Xun and added.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing better to say between the both of us. We indulged in a passionate affair built on mutual consent. I don\u2019t think you ate any loss so you shouldn\u2019t even be trying to get back at me.\u201d\u201cWhat a sharp tongue and a glib mouth.\u201d Ji Xun pinched her chin, and ridiculed.At this moment, his handsome face was extremely close, his nose poking her face. Ruan Jiaojiao stared at the pretty mole at the corner of his eye and earnestly said.\u201cJi Xun. If I didn\u2019t have such an awkward relationship with your brother. I actually still enjoyed sleeping with you.\u201dRuan Jiaojiao really said these words without any hesitation, even if it sounded lascivious.The air soaked in silence for a few seconds\u2026The three men who were present felt that this loose woman who lied and acted without any effort, had finally revealed her true character.As the woman had already bared her shamelessness, the men were at a loss on what to do with her.Seeing the two remain silent, Ruan Jiaojiao shifted her gaze towards Yan Xingyan.\u201cYou should let him go. He\u2019s completely innocent of this matter. If you have any grudges, just direct them to me.\u201dShe originally spoke with an undaunted air but in the end, unsure of what it is that triggered the switch, Ji Xun and Ji Che looked at her fixated like needles pricking her face,\u201cBrother. What do you think we should do? Tell me.\u201d Ji Che looked at Ji Xun, asking for his opinion.Ji Xun sneered coldly and answered evilly.\u201cIf we hadn\u2019t showed up here, wouldn\u2019t you have been engrossed in f*cking on the ground?\u201dRuan Jiaojiao: \u201c\u2026.\u201dIn the next second, she quickly reacted, covering her chest with both hands and staring at Ji Xun with a wary and fearful look, speaking with an unyielding tone.\u201cDon\u2019t-\u2026.Don\u2019t you dare try to mess with me!\u201dHer words seemed to have instantly ignited Ji Xun\u2019s anger as he simply detonated.Ji Xun started laughing in anger.\u201cMess with you? This daddy hasn\u2019t even done anything yet to you. You wrapped your legs around my waist and sucked on this daddy\u2019s c*ck like there\u2019s no tomorrow and even moaned out continuously from the pleasure!\u201dJi Xun\u2019s words mixed with obscenity struck Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s sore point, making her thick-skinned face turn red and her bottom wet.As such, Ji Xun lifted her up in one fell swoop and pressed her down on the living room dining table. When he pulled down her pants, she simply did not resist.Upon holding his rod, aiming it at her flower seams and shoving it in, she finally let out a restrained and suppressed cry.While the two bodies were finally joined together, Ji Che sat on the sofa without moving, Yan Xingyan who was at the entrance hall did not move a muscle as well.In reality, because the dining table of the living room was situated close to the kitchen and no light was lit, the area was quite dim. Moreover, some furnitures were blocking the view, but when Ruan Jiaojiao turned her head to the side, she was able to see Ji Che sitting on the sofa as well as Yan Xingyan who was leaning on the wall, sitting upright with his hands bound.This situation was so f*cking shameful!!Ruan Jiaojiao hadn\u2019t experienced a circumstance like this.Meeting a bastard like Ji Xun really let her experience all kinds of things.Not a single person out of the four spoke up inside the room so awkward silence prevailed for a period of time.However, at this moment, the living room was split into two. One side was the quiet Ji Che and Yan Xingyan, the other were the pair in entanglement, Ji Xun and Ruan Jiaojiao.However, Ji Xun only made small thrusts, shaking his cr*tch. The buckle of his belt as well as the shifting of their clothes produced sounds. Ruan Jiaojiao bit her lip. At the start, she felt a bit embarrassed but the more his member rocked inside her c*nt, an unspeakable pleasure and an impatient restlessness started to sweep her body.Ji Xun seemed intent on tormenting her, moving slowly and unhurriedly, stirring her pool of spring water and slowly provoking a ripple of desire. Her arousal had reached a certain level but he deliberately barred her from attaining peak, using this leisurely pace to slowly consume all her patience.Ruan Jiaojiao reached her hands into his clothes, digging her nails on his back.Stinky brat! B*stard!Her action merely elicited a chuckle out of Ji Xun as he neared his lips towards her ear and said lowly.\u201cDo you want me to go faster? Then cry out loud, once you do, I\u2019ll immediately fulfill your wishes\u2026\u201dThis was simply challenging the bottom line of her principles.The system who was watching the show, laughed wretchedly.\u201cI didn\u2019t think the host would have such a thing as principles.\u201d\u201cShut it!\u201dRuan Jiaojiao cursed on the inside before biting Ji Xun\u2019s shoulder with all her might. Yet, Ji Xun did not show the slightest reaction, maintaining the same slow pace as though he was a monk in meditation.Angered, she retreated backwards, putting distance in between the joined parts of their body, making the table let out a creaking sound before the sound of friction against the ground rang out.That was when Ji Xun had instantly pressed her on the table, tugging her legs and once again sending his departed meat stick into her damp cave.And this time, he no longer deliberately took his time. He pierced her and pulled back just as fiercely, the slapping of their fleshes producing \u2018papa\u2019 sounds, mixed with the creaking sounds of the table. Struck with a sudden penetration, Ruan Jiaojiao was simply unable to hold back her moans and cried out, losing all rationality after. Waves of desire washed over her, turning her world upside down and she could only let herself be swept along with it, her mouth continuously leaking out mewls as her body started to spasm.Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s high-pitched moans interweaved with Ji Xun\u2019s pants until she attained release. Her whole body fell limp on the table, and she became distracted and absent-minded for a while after orgasming.By the time she regained her senses, she discovered another man\u2019s figure appearing right in front of her. His ice cold finger stroked her bright and clean thighs, making Ruan Jiaojiao quiver.Ji-\u2026Ji Che?She quickly sat herself up.At this time, Ji Xun took her into his arms, tidying up her clothes and just covering her rump.\u201cBrother, did you see how much she enjoys being f*cked by me?\u201dRuan Jiaojiao decided to bide her time. She wanted to see what these pair of brothers were planning to do.Since there wasn\u2019t any light in this area, only the light from the entrance hall poured in so the view was dim. Ruan Jiaojiao couldn\u2019t see the expressions of the two but she could feel the air between them turning tense.Yiii? Why did something not feel right?Ruan Jiaojiao then suddenly realized that Yan Xingyan who was originally bound by the entrance hall was gone!She recalled the small movements he made earlier as well as how he was sitting upright leaning against the wall.Ruan Jiaojiao didn\u2019t dare make too much of a reaction in order to prevent catching the attention of the two brothers. She lowered her head and cast a surreptitious glance at the living room, looking for any trails of Yan Xingyan.At this moment, Ji Che suddenly went crazy, tugging Ruan Jiaojiao out of his arms. The two were caught off guard and Ruan Jiaojiao fell headfirst from the momentum of the pull.Fortunately, Ji Xun reacted quickly, so before her face could intimately touch the ground, she was caught in his arms.F*ck!Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s heart thumped wildly from nearly suffering an unforeseen accident.\u201cScum!\u201dJi Che spat out. He had just witnessed an erotic entanglement in action and so anger mixed with lust made him lose rationality but he held himself back.Thinking that this woman had been mewling so captivatedly under another man\u2019s body yet she rejected himself\u2026Was she the scummy person or was it him?Even after clearly knowing she was this kind of woman, why did he still yearn for her?Ruan Jiaojiao listened to the system narrate the male lead\u2019s inner thoughts and couldn\u2019t help but click her tongue. Sure enough, the male lead was a natural super masochist.The year Su Xue broke up with him, he was unable to forget his old affections. But when the original lead showed him her heart, he didn\u2019t treasure it. Instead, towards a heartless girl like her, he brooded over her and had simply thrown out Su Xue who had sacrificed things for his love, like worn out shoes.She could only say that this male lead only liked to look for pain and not joy!And in terms of strength, he could not win against Ji Xun.However, since he was his older brother and he had slept with his sister-in-law, he still seemed a bit regretful.As Ji Xun subdued Ji Che, Ruan Jiaojiao lifted her eyes and saw Yan Xingyan hold a chair preparing to smash it over Ji Xun.Ruan Jiaojiao was taken aback. She didn\u2019t want to see a bloody tragedy occur first hand. She wanted to leave this world cleanly and didn\u2019t want to involve the innocent.And so, she rushed over, pushing Yan Xingyan away.\u201cDon\u2019t! Don\u2019t do it!!\u201dJi Xun looked behind him and thought. Hah. It looked like this bastard wanted to use this opportunity to mount a snake attack on him!He threw Ji Che down and rolled up his sleeves, preparing to go all out.Ruan Jiaojiao held Yan Xingyan\u2019s waist tight and howled towards Ji Xun powerfully.\u201cNobody make a move!!\u201dShe was like an elementary student disciple officer, shouting judiciously at bad students.After howling, Ruan Jiaojiao was a bit out of breath. Once she had regained a bit of calm, seeing the two not make a move, she continued to howl.\u201cThis is my home! No fighting in my home!!\u201dThe next day.Once the three people had woken up, they couldn\u2019t find Ruan Jiaojiao anywhere.She had left a note containing 9 words.I\u2019m leaving. Don\u2019t look for me. Don\u2019t miss me.Ji Xun rushed out in madness, mobilizing all his connections to search for her whereabouts.Ji Che went to the Ruan residence residence, however, the Ruan family said she was leaving to take a breather and hadn\u2019t set a return date.As Ruan Jiaojiao had told the Ruan family she had done hurtful things to Ji Che, the Ruan Family did not blame Ji Che, but somewhat pitied him instead. After all, they had spoiled their daughter to become this willful. This doll of the Ji family was so pitiful. Originally, several girls dreamed of marrying him, but in the end, they had heard that the other lady who was supposed to marry him, had also run away. <sup>1</sup> Referring to Su Xue, the female lead.Sigh..it was truly such a sin!It was only Yan Xingyan who did not start looking for Ruan Jiaojiao.He had a feeling that there would be no use in looking for her.After a long time had passed, the three men felt as though they had dreamt a long dream.After the bad woman who lied constantly and made their teeth itch with hatred, turned everything into a mess, she patted off her bum and disappeared without a trace,\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014T/N: Just one more arc left to do\u2026.

Do you think your petite body can withstand three men?\u201dRuan Jiaojiao lowered her eyes and responded somewhat helplessly.\u201cThere\u2019s no other way. I can only sacrifice little ol\u2019 me for the greater collective whole. For the sake of maintaining peace between you guys, I can only offer my body.\u201d\u201cAre you going to do it or not? If you don\u2019t want to join in, you can leave. Take care, I won\u2019t be sending you off. I\u2019m going to wash up first.\u201dAfter leaving these words, Ruan Jiaojiao left the three men and walked into the bathroom.Very quickly, the sound of water rang out from the bathroom.Ji Xun narrowed his eyes and didn\u2019t even spare a glance at the two other people. He quickly pulled the zipper of his jacket down and threw it away, then he removed his pants and quickly peeled himself naked. Right before the two men, he swaggered towards the door and pulled it open, walking inside naked from head to toe.His arrogant appearance looked as though he was showing off his exceptional \u2018gift\u2019, as well as his proud figure and muscular contours.\u201cYou-..you.. B*stard! This granny hasn\u2019t even finished washing yet\u2026mmm\u2026\u201dRuan Jiaojiao\u2019s curses travelling out from the bathroom quickly turned into ambiguous moans.Ji Che and Yan Xingyan exchanged a look. Ji Che\u2019s brain was a mess as if he had split into two different people.One part told him to immediately leave this place. He couldn\u2019t continue wading through this muddy water, that he needed to purify himself!The other told him he had no way of ignoring his lust. He wanted her. He had turned mad from wanting her and at this moment, his cock was swollen and hard to the point it was about to burst. The desire he had never vented on the woman had pushed up on the verge of collapse.Why the hell could Ji Xun do whatever he wanted with her but he had to bear it?!Ji Che entered the bathroom directly and had just come across the scene of Ji Xun parting her legs, thrusting his malevolent cock into her flower cave. She sat on the counter, facing the door so he could see clearly how her tender and pink hole was pried open.The last string of reason in Ji Che\u2019s head snapped. He rushed over, pulling Ji Xun away. Ji Xun didn\u2019t resist, letting him have the position while he stood at the side rubbing his meat.Ji Che pulled down his zipper and without uttering another word, he let out his pulsing, veiny and iron hot member, ramming it inside her honey-seeping flower seams.With a \u201cpuchi\u201d sound, he pounded her again and again, ruthlessly and fiercely like a tiger descending the mountain, a hungry wolf preying on a lamb. He exerted all of his strength and instantly reached the depths of her flower pot whereas Ruan Jiaojiao cried out from his thrust, unknown whether it was from pleasure or pain.Ji Che\u2019s c*ck was wrapped around by her cave tightly. The wet and tight inside was something he had never experienced before.It felt too good\u2026.So this is what doing a hole felt like\u2026As though he was a guy who had gotten his first taste of meat after finishing puberty, he lowered his head and continued doing her wildly with no skills to speak of. After thrusting several times, he quivered for a moment before releasing.He blanked out for a while and at this moment, his younger brother Ji Xun pushed him away and as though it was a relay race, he stuck his member in.Ji Che was stunned before his handsome face soon tinged red. He had just come prematurely!Even though he felt good, compared to Ji Xun\u2026he was still lacking a lot!!As the male lead, his ego suffered a heavy hit. Ji Che stared blankly at Ji Xun f**king Ruan Jiaojiao. The girl\u2019s cheeks were dyed with a peach color, a thin layer of mist clouded her eyes and her ruddy lips were parted slightly. Ji Xun lowered his head and kissed her lips, entangling the two people\u2019s tongue together while his lower body continued to hump her without stopping, maintaining a strong, quick and long rhythm.It was as if his younger brother and his fiancee were giving him a class on coitus.The two were completely naked. Ji Xun\u2019s sexy wheat toned strong body pressed against Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s white and soft body. His lips travelled downwards, licking her chin, neck, collarbone, trailing little kisses before stopping at her perky mounds.Ji Xun then pried his thin lips open, taking the er*ct tip of her bunnies in, his lips and tongue working together to suck and flick as though he was sampling a fine delicacy. Ji Che\u2019s Adam\u2019s apple bobbed, inadvertently gulping a mouth of saliva, feeling his throat turn parched from the sight.Blood started to rush into his member that had just turned limp from release not too long ago, the er*tic sight arousing him.Ji Che removed his clothes and walked over, carrying Ruan Jiaojiao down from the counter and sticking close to her clean back.The brothers shared a rapport, and it only took them one glance to understand each other.Three people entered the bathroom and turned the hot water on. Ruan Jiaojiao was wedged in between the two men, her legs wrapped around Ji Xun\u2019s waist as he continued f**king her hole, allowing the sparkling and translucent nectar to splash out whereas Ji Che held her from behind, kissing her neck and heightening her arousal. His palm kneaded her full bunnies as though they were dough, his strength intermittently shifting between soft and strong.For a moment, Ruan Jiaojiao didn\u2019t know where she was, her mind was completely enchanted.She was going to die\u2026She couldn\u2019t take this\u2026Ruan Jiaojiao quivered, immediately climbing the peak of lust. In her daze, the two men switched position. Ji Xun had just pulled out when Ji Che inserted his lively and spirited hard rod into the depths of her flower cave.\u201cNo\u2026No more\u2026I can\u2019t\u2026\u201dRuan Jiaojiao was extremely tired and feeble, her mouth refusing weakly despite her body wholeheartedly welcoming each and every thrust Ji Che made. Her white mounds swayed back and forth like jumping bunnies and immersed in the pleasure, Ruan Jiaojiao was like a blossoming flower, provoking one to pluck her.By the time Ruan Jiaojiao came out wrapped in a towel, she laid down on the bed, exhausted beyond words.The system popped out in time and taunted her in delight.\u201cWith this strength of yours, you still wanted to maintain peace and what? Save the world?\u201dRuan Jiaojiao only managed to squeeze one word out.\u201cScram!\u201dWe\u2019ll cross that bridge when we get there.Ji Che and Jiu Xun had only eaten until they were half full but they empathized that she was merely one delicate flower unable to withstand two men releasing all their desires. As such, they obediently attended to her, washing her clean, blowing her hair dry, covering her with the quilt and letting her sleep.Ruan Jiaojiao slept in a daze when she sensed someone pulling her quilt away and slipping inside. Smelling that fresh and fragrant scent, she identified it as the scent that made her feel at ease and so, she turned around, rolling into his warm embrace.\u201cXingyan, you\u2019re so nice.\u201d She murmured.No! He didn\u2019t want to play the role of a nice guy at all!Yan Xingyan was a little vexed. And so, he flipped her over and pressed her down under him, parting her legs and inserting his rod in.He wanted her but he only liked it when it was the both of them. That way, it\u2019ll give him an illusion that she was his and only his.Upon plunging his member fully into her warm cave, Yan Xingyan did not furiously start thr*sting. His movements were gentle and careful as though he was handling a fragile good. That was why he didn\u2019t wake her up, letting her remain fast asleep.He reached out a hand, stroking her peaceful sleeping countenance and gently pecked her forehead.\u201cJiaojiao\u2026\u201dIn the dead of night, he gasped softly in his ear.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-T/N: Out of all the chapters I\u2019ve translated for BPETIT, this is probably the only chapter I like and where I think the smut is actually decent and not disappointing.

Who dares to hit this granny!! Where\u2019s the knife?! This granny is going to cut this gutsy person!!She immediately opened her eyes\u2026.Then raised her head\u2026looking at the person who had just given her two resounding slaps on the face.The other person was a malicious and unkind old woman who wore a grey ruqun <sup>1</sup> Ruqun: An attire worn by ladies in the ancient period. as though her parents had died, looking at her fiercely like a witch.\u201cWhat? You still dare to glare at me? You silly little girl, do you think I won\u2019t rip you apart?!\u201dRuan Jiaojiao sensed that something was wrong so she held herself back and didn\u2019t do anything.Hmph. A nobleman always gets his revenge, even if it takes him 10 years.At this time, the system\u2019s wretched voice rang out, mocking her.\u201cDidn\u2019t you say that you\u2019ll immediately settle any grudges on the spot?\u201dRuan Jiaojiao said through gritted teeth.\u201cThen why don\u2019t you take a look whether this granny\u2019s fighting index is strong enough to retaliate!\u201dShe had just raised her head to see the other party\u2019s face more clearly when Ruan Jiaojiao noticed something amiss.She lowered her head and reached out a hand. As expected, she saw a chubby little claws and short little legs.She was clearly just a little girl right now! Fuck!Just as expected, the system\u2019s wretched voice rang again.\u201cIsn\u2019t it a nice surprise? Were you surprised?!\u201dRuan Jiaojiao felt so stifled she didn\u2019t want to speak. With her current small frame, it looked like she had to wait for 8 or 10 years to grow up into beauty, otherwise, she\u2019d only attract lolicons.She clenched her fists hidden inside her sleeves and lowered her head. The old woman also looked like she had her own misgivings. After all, she was just a child. If she hit her too hard, it wouldn\u2019t be easy to explain so she scolded her for a while, saying that she wouldn\u2019t be able to eat anything before leaving.At this moment, Ruan Jiaojiao stood by the stream and waited until the old woman had left. Even though she didn\u2019t hold much expectations, she still crouched down to take a look at the original owner\u2019s appearance and couldn\u2019t help but sigh.Tsk tsk! That old woman was clearly just jealous!Even though at present she was just a little girl who hadn\u2019t shed her baby fat away, she still looked like she was carved out of jade, a little girl with an exquisite appearance. Her cheeks were not only rosy, but were tender and smooth, however, because of the two sequential slaps on her fair cheeks, two bright red hand marks appeared on the surface.Ruan Jiaojiao took out a handkerchief and dabbed it a bit in the cold creek water, wiping it slightly to lower the temperature, silently noting down today\u2019s grudge in her heart.Hmph!Stinky woman, you better remember this!After Ruan Jiaojiao finished receiving the whole plot, she wanted to vomit blood out.Though the old woman who had just struck her on the face earlier, was not related to her by blood, she had to call her mother.That woman was Yuan Sanniang, who was originally the pretty daughter of a humble family. Because her family had fallen into dire straits and had become destitute, she was sold by her father to a low-grade brothel and was bought back by the leader of a demonic sect, but only as a part of the group of girls the demonic leader had brought back together. Once her good looks slowly declined, the leader casually conferred her to one of his subordinates to serve as his wife.His husband was always out on missions and was never home all year round whereas she worked as a servant in the demonic sect, carrying out all sorts of odd jobs and having achieved nothing after several years, as such, she turned into a resentful woman.Half a month ago, her husband, Ruan Dacheng, brought the original owner home to serve as his adopted daughter.Ruan Jiaojiao was a little beggar so Ruan Dacheng had brought back a malnourished and sickly girl but didn\u2019t expect that after taking care of her for two weeks, she grew up to have snow white skin and gorgeous looks. Ruan Dacheng liked her very much and had always doted on her.However, Yuan Sanniang who originally didn\u2019t have any motherly feelings towards Ruan Jiajiao, had been ridden with jealousy because of this. A woman\u2019s jealous heart had always been terrifying, not to mention, the jealousy of a resentful woman. When Ruan Dacheng left the sect, Yuan Sanniang started to change and torture Ruan Jiaojiao, venting all her frustrations on her.Ruan Jiaojiao grew up everyday beside this black-hearted woman. The more she grew, the more she became prettier and radiant. She was several times more beautiful than Yuan Sanniang was when she was young and she was originally a beggar who lived in the streets but had come to lodge under another person\u2019s roof. The original owner knew how to show a hypocritical face of affection and curry favor from others, That was why even though she was only 13 years when she got out of this predicament, she had already influenced all the boys and girls of the sect to like her, even the son of the leader, her childhood friend adored her, asking her for her hand in marriage.With such a large contrast, Yuan Sanniang grew increasingly resentful and hateful towards this step-daughter. Moreover, with the two of them interacting everyday, how could she not be aware of how the original owner\u2019s beauty had already started to show through.Later, Yuan Sanniang plotted to send the original owner to the sect leader\u2019s bed.The current sect leader was a lascivious middle-aged fat man!!If a delicate flower had been heartlessly ruined before she could even blossom into her most beautiful appearance, the original owner\u2019s world would no doubtedly crumble and she would completely turn into the demonic enchantress who was going to take revenge on society.Of course, the first thing she did was to stab Yuan Sanniang with a knife and she had done this several times, causing her warm blood to splash on her face.The demonic sect leader also became quite taken in with Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s blackening due to this matter and imparted martial arts to her.After a few years, the sect leader died in the middle of the war with the upright sect of the martial arts and because his vitality had taken a great hit, the succeeding leader took his place and Ruan Jiaojiao was promoted to a higher position.However, her childhood friend in her former days had already lost all affection for her after the original owner\u2019s dirty incident with his father. He was only using her as the original owner had looks and ability so as the succeeding leader, he sent her as a mole. The original owner used her looks to successfully approach the leader of the upright sect and become his concubine, drugging her husband but didn\u2019t expect the female lead, who was the upright sect\u2019s daughter, to uncover her true identity.After the original owner was exposed, in the midst of the confrontation between the demonic sect and upright sect, she was pushed to become a bargaining chip and as a result, her childhood sweetheart used a concealed weapon to kill her without any hesitation.Ruan Jiaojiao sighed. What a pathetic life. She was clearly a beauty who was so tender, water could be squeezed out but she could only sleep with two ugly old men before she died, what a waste of this flower-like visage.The system had no strength left to continue mocking her.\u201cSo this was the only point you realized after hearing the whole plot?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 46": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Being PAPA\u2019d Every Time I TransmigrateChapter 45 [3rd World 2] What are you playing house for?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTime flew by like an arrow and the sun and moon were like a shuttle, in the blink of an eye, five years had already passed.Ruan Jiaojiao had already become the beauty that had won the hearts of all the people in the demonic sect.Every day, when she opened her eyes, she would be faced with the most good-looking youth of the sect and she would wrap her hands around him and press a kiss on his tender thin lips, making the youth\u2019s handsome face tint with a red flush.After successfully stirring a pond of spring water, Ruan Jiaojiao lazily got up and prepared to get off the bed.\u201cJiaojiao, I have something to tell you.\u201dHm?Ruan Jiaojiao was faced with the young master of the Demonic Sect Qi Shen\u2019s serious gaze.Looking at the girl\u2019s appearance, which exceeded the beauty of a flower, looking at him with a confused and ignorant expression, Qi Shen\u2019s eyes softened and he rubbed her head.\u201cJiaojiao, you\u2019ve already grown up. &amp;nbsp;You should know the differences between man and woman and you can\u2019t casually have intimate contact with them, do you understand?\u201dOho?!Ruan Jiaojiao and the system nearly cried tears of joy at this moment.The youth she had cultivated for several years had finally been enlightened.It was really hard for an old fox like Ruan Jiaojiao to continue pretending to be sweet for several years. However, draping herself with rabbit skin also had its benefits as any action she took was interpreted as innocent and without fault.That was why whenever she was woken up by nightmares in the middle of the night and was too afraid to fall asleep, she would crawl into the bed of her most favorite and most good-looking Brother Qi, asking for hugs and comfort.This kind of pure bed-sharing lasted for 5 years.She had touched his delicate tofu so much it had turned into soft tofu. The little handsome youth had grown into a devilishly charming youth but had never laid hand on the delicate flower that was her.Of course, Ruan Jiaojiao still held her principles. She was after all still a child!!That was why she merely took liberties by feasting her eyes on him. As for the saying \u2018appetite and lust are only natural\u2019, even if she didn\u2019t have a beauty to enjoy, her other favorite pastime was to eat.Ruan Jiaojiao had a sweet mouth and a thick skin, able to coax the chefs into giving her special treatment. Seeing her eat with a flower-like smile on her face, the kitchen uncles\u2019 and aunties\u2019 hearts were filled with honey.It was as though raising the darling princess Jiajiao to be white and chubby was of utmost importance in the demonic sect.Even the usually cold and ruthless protectors who carried out missions, never forgot to bring Jiaojiao a bit of culinary delicacies upon their return.Because of this, Ruan Jiaojiao knew that Qi Shen\u2019s words from today were said out of jealousy.Knowing that she wouldn\u2019t be happy without any meat, Bai Jingyan brought back a whole ham upon his return from his mission. Ruan Jiaojiao immediately asked the people to bring it to the kitchen to be cooked and at the same time, she immediately leapt up from excitement into Bai Jingyan\u2019s arms, giving him two kisses on the left and right cheek.This scene was coincidentally seen by Qi Shen and his face had turned green as though a green hat was forced on top of his head.However, as Ruan Jiaojiao was still young, he could not blame her.However, he couldn\u2019t care more for Bai Jingyan whose martial arts far surpassed the masses at the demonic sect, having gained a high position and importance in the sect at such a young age.Even though Qi Shen was the sect leader\u2019s son, he was still too young and inexperienced, having the four biggest protectors as his teachers.Towards Qi Shen\u2019s education, Ruan Jiaojiao didn\u2019t want to entangle with him and simply gave him a strong comeback.She blinked her watery eyes and put on a confused face, telling Qi Shen.\u201cBut, Brother Qi, Uncle Qi and those aunties are also adults. They all take off their clothes in the same room as Uncle Qi, how could there be differences between man and woman?\u201dQi Shen immediately choked upon being questioned.The sect leader Qi Zhanfeng\u2019s lustful nature was renowned in the entire world. He liked looking for all kinds of beautiful girls to raise by his side but what was weird was that, Qi Shen was his only child. His birth mother was Qi Shenfeng\u2019s original madam whose body was unwell and had passed away from sickness early on.Ruan Jiaojiao thought to herself that she must\u2019ve been angered by the fickle-hearted Qi Zhanfeng or perhaps due to harboring guilt towards his wife, Qi Zhanfeng only had Qi Shen as his child and though he had taken in many concubines, he never married another official madame.After the brief episode in the morning, Ruan Jiaojiao didn\u2019t put it to heart and merely thought of the piece of ham. Eating it cold, fried or stewed would be delicious, she reckoned.Ruan Jiaojiao happily ran outside and suddenly noticed a sneaky figure hiding in the dark watching her.She simply walked over and stood in front of the person.The girl\u2019s clothes were tattered and her gaze was turbid. The hand she reached out to her was like a matchstick and she was only in her thirties but she looked to be in her sixties.It was Yuan Sanniang who acted high and mighty in the past, having been reduced to this kind of appearance.Ruan Jiaojiao naturally wasn\u2019t the original owner who would watch other\u2019s expressions and bear humiliation to save her own skin as she lived under other people\u2019s roofs. She waited for Ruan Dacheng to come home and complained to him, letting him see the scars and bruises she had underneath her clothes caused by Yuan Sanniang\u2019s tyranny,Ruan Dacheng looked at the originally fair girl being tortured to this degree and felt his heart clench in distress. He didn\u2019t think that Yuan Sanniang would be such an evil-hearted woman. When Yuan Sanniang saw that Ruan Jiaojiao had actually dared to tell her on her, she wanted to immediately rip her apart but was stopped by Ruan Dacheng.Ruan Dacheng knew that the two girls in his family couldn\u2019t get along like fire and water but he naturally doted more on the pitiful and weak Ruan Jiaojiao and so, he gave Yuan Sanniang a large amount of money and asked her to leave.Yuan Sanniang originally didn\u2019t like Ruan Dacheng and now that she had money, she thought she could have a new beginning. She quickly took the sum and left, feeling rejuvenated.This matter had also allowed the people of the sect to learn of the little lady\u2019s existence and they all felt distress for her lonely and mistreated past.Ruan Jiaojiao was not as naive as Yuan Sanniang. In the chaotic world of martial arts, how could a single woman survive all by herself?Looking at her current appearance, she knew for sure that she must\u2019ve gone through a hard time.Unfortunately, the original owner\u2019s wish was to actually find her birth father and mother!!This meant that even if she was willing or not, she needed to leave the demonic sect and according to the system\u2019s sick character, needed to be involved in another melodramatic plot. The moment Ruan Jiaojiao thought about her mission, she would feel her head start to ache.\u201cAuntie, you\u2026\u201dFacing Yuan Sanniang, Ruan Jiaojiao feigned that she didn\u2019t recognize her and asked her politely.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Faced with Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s beautiful face, jealousy and resentment made her nearly lose control of her expression, almost revealing malevolence.If it weren\u2019t for this lowly wench, how could she have fallen this low!!Yuan Sanniang saw that Ruan Jiaojiao did not recognize her and in fear that the other party would guard herself against her, she didn\u2019t reveal her identity and lowered her head, coughing a bit before leaving.Ruan Jiaojiao claimed she was stupid and that was because the old hag had forgotten that strangers couldn\u2019t easily enter into the demonic sect.Ruan Jiaojiao merely pulled a bypasser, saying that she saw an old woman being sneaky and didn\u2019t know whether she was a mole sent by the upright sect. As such, Yuan Sanniang was quickly captured and locked up.Dealing with this trash was as easy as blowing off dust.In the dead of the night, Ruan Jiaojiao slipped into prison and saw the curled up Yuan Sanniang. The other party watched her with a gaze seeping with poison, itching to rip into her flesh.Without saying another word, Ruan Jiaojiao raised a hand and slapped her left and right, giving her four slaps in total before rubbing her aching hand.Yuan Sanniang was dumbfounded for a moment but before she could start shouting abuse at her, Ruan Jiaojiao took off her socks and stuffed it into her mouth.A noble man always gets his revenge, even if it takes him 10 years. She still remembered the two slaps she had given her back in the past.The system saw this and didn\u2019t make a sound.Ruan Jiaojiao was just about to leave after hitting her and simply didn\u2019t have any intentions to reminisce old memories with her. Yuan Sanniang watched her leaving figure, hating that she couldn\u2019t rush over and rip her into pieces.This little girl had simply recognized her from the start but pretended not to and then found someone to arrest her.Yuan Sanniang thought to wait for someone to come and catch the brat\u2019s true face, giving her a ruthless scolding but didn\u2019t think that she wouldn\u2019t be able to live long enough to see the sun the next day.When Bai Jingyan received his subordinate\u2019s report, identifying the captured woman to be the malicious mother who had maltreated Ruan Jiaojiao in the past, he arrived at the prison and personally saw the scene of Ruan Jiaojiao slapping the woman.Feeling taken aback as he hid in the dark, a small smirk hooked onto his lips.When Ruan Jiaojiao left, he then took out a prepared porcelain bottle and walked towards Yuan Sanniang. That was something he had asked from Luo Yunlou who specialized in poison.The person who consumed it would feel his heart being bitten by thousands of ants and would struggle for half an hour before dying from pain.When the system recounted this matter to Ruan Jiaojiao, Ruan Jiaojiao had just been climbing up a window and just as she reached, the window was already pulled open from the inside, revealing Qi Shen who had his arms crossed, looking at her.Under the bright moonlight, the youth\u2019s face was handsome and bright as jade and his eyes were dark like onyx, his long hair draped down like black satin, his lips the shade of cinnabar.This kind of alluring beauty made a sentence pop into Chu Jiao\u2019s mind. If I die under a skirt, I can still flirt as a ghost\u2026.As expected, she hadn\u2019t climbed the window for several years in vain for such a beauty.\u201cBrother Qi, hug!\u201dShe lifted her lips into a smile, spreading her arms towards Qi Shen and he carried her up and rested her in his arms.Ruan Jiaojiao laid against Qi Shen\u2019s strong chest and rubbed her face against it in intoxication, smelling the fresh scent on his body.Even though the two had done such an intimate act several times in the past few years, lately, Qi Shen felt his breath quickening and his heart pacing faster.Jiaojiao was already a grown up lady. When she laid on the bed, the lapels of her clothes would reveal a small ravine, exposing her pink lotus dudou containing her fair white mounds.At this moment, the two round fleshes were pressed against his body.Qi Shen could only have a morning physiological reaction. At this moment, he had gotten so hard it hurt.What a beast!Ruan Jiaojiao could feel a hard tent forming under her buttocks.The question was, to eat or not to eat?She recalled the times she used her hand to measure Qi Shen\u2019s length and eventually dispelled this idea.With her petite frame right now, she couldn\u2019t eat such a big fellow, it would only pain her to death.\u201cBrother Qi, your meat stick is poking me.\u201dRuan Jiaojiao said such shameless words with an innocent face before naturally pushing him away and getting off of him.Once the fragrant soft jade left his arms, Qi Shen only felt coldness in his arms. Having never wronged himself, he once again took Ruan Jiaojiao into his arms and this time, he simply carried her to bed.\u201cJiaojiao, let\u2019s get married.\u201dRuan Jiaojiao: \u201c?!\u201dShe was still a child!!However, in this era, child marriages were common.Moreover, this was the demonic sect, how could they speak of morals and ethics! Strength was the highest criterion they held.If it weren\u2019t because of Qi Zhanfeng\u2019s martial arts being the strongest, the demonic sect could have transitioned to a new regime.\u201cBrother Qi, I\u2019m hungry.\u201dRuan Jiaojiao didn\u2019t want to get married. As such, she aptly changed the topic on hand.Qi Shen heard this and years of cultivated habit made him immediately get off the bed and find something for Ruan Jiaojiao to eat.Look at the little wolfdog I raised, isn\u2019t he obedient!Ruan Jiaojiao couldn\u2019t help but show off to the system smugly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He then bent down, parted his thin lips and covered her pink lips.\u201cMm\u2026\u201dRuan Jiajiao didn\u2019t open her eyes. In reality, she had just fallen asleep and Qi Shen\u2019s sudden action stirred her awake. She felt him kissing her and took the initiative to open her mouth and let him in, even entangling with his tongue fervently.As the atmosphere grew warmer, Ruan Jiaojiao felt her body getting hotter, as though Qi Shen\u2019s kiss had melted her. She mewled softly, feeling a hand covering her chest and rubbing her growing br*asts strongly.\u201cIt hurts\u2026\u201dRuan Jiaojiao opened her misty eyes and complained softly.The beautiful girl voiced her annoyance stickily but it only acted like oil being poured into fire. The flame instantly spread, the scalding heat creating a prairie fire, difficult to put out once it had started.A flame appeared in Qi Shen\u2019s pitch black eyes and his whole person covered her, his big palm pulling Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s lapels, instantly revealing a large patch of white and exquisite skin. These were her lustrous bare shoulders and her dudou <sup>1</sup> Dudou is an inner clothing covering the chest which covered some of her flaky chest. The er*tic sight in front of him made Qi Shen\u2019s breath hitch and he impatiently pressed his lips against the girl\u2019s soft and smooth skin, greedily sucking strongly.Leaving red marks on Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s white and tender skin, the red and white colors intertwined, stimulating the man\u2019s desire even more.In truth, Ruan Jiaojiao was feeling conflicted.To eat or not to eat?She was really hesitating, Qi Shen was a little too violent. This world relied on one\u2019s martial arts as a measure of strength. He was clearly a hothead, simply unable to control his own strength and dealt with things rather impulsively whereas her body was still as tender as that of a young chick\u2019s.She would only get hurt! She would only feel extreme pain!!Ruan Jiaojiao didn\u2019t want to lose to her lust and end up regretting her decision due to the tragic ending of her first time. Even though she liked Qi Shen, it wasn\u2019t to the point she was willing to experience tearing pain. Moreover, with this brat\u2019s energy, he definitely wouldn\u2019t be satisfied with doing it once.Her fear of pain took over her senses.Ruan Jiaojiao blinked her eyes and tears started to trickle down her eyes. Qi Shen was taken aback and raised his head, looking into a pair of accusing watery eyes.She pursed her lips and started to act.\u201cBrother Qi! You\u2019re bullying me!! Wuuuu\u2026.look at what you did to me\u2026.wuuuu\u2026.Boys who bully girls are the most hateful!!\u201cRuan Jiaojiao knew that after this play was over, it could easily bite her back in the ass, especially since her pitiful appearance could easily stir a man\u2019s beastly desire to ravage. And so, she pushed Qi Shen away and held her lapels, covering her mouth and running out.She ran for a few steps before suddenly stopping and turning around, glaring at Qi Shen viciously but lovely.\u201cDon\u2019t follow me! I\u2019m angry at you!! If you follow me, I\u2019ll ignore you forever!!\u201dAfter yelling these words, Ruan Jiaojiao shook the goosebumps that arose on her body and while Qi Shen was hesitating because of her threat, she took this opportunity to run away.After returning to her quarters, Ruan Jiaojiao closed the doors and her shoulders dropped instantly.This greedy youth. As soon as he tasted the sweet taste, she would definitely have to retract all the free welfare she had been giving him, otherwise, she would only be inviting calamity and would end up getting swallowed.Thinking of this world\u2019s dangerous martial arts setting, once the experts made a move, they\u2019d be able to break a person\u2019s limbs in a short period, making for a bloody and ruthless sight. Ruan Jiaojiao was a weakling so she couldn\u2019t help but worry at the thought of having to leave the demonic sect in the future.Truthfully, as long as she hugged Qi Shen\u2019s thigh, she could learn martial arts a little earlier like the original owner did and learn how to protect herself.However, she was too lazy\u2026not only was she lazy..she was even afraid of pain and didn\u2019t wnat to do any tough work\u2026.Ruan Jiaojiao contemplated and felt that the future was hard to predict. She gradually grew more angry at the rubbish system who dug this pit, throwing a delicate flower like her in a ruthless martial arts world. Doesn\u2019t its conscience hurt at all?System: Never. It only feels that its host needs to be put through more arduous trials. For the sake of giving more trouble to its host, it\u2019s going to continue persisting in its efforts! Add oil!! <sup>2</sup> Add oil is a common chinese saying which means \u201cWork hard!\u201d\u2026\u2026\u201dJiaojiao, come here and let uncle take a look.\u201dRuan Jiaojiao feigned timidness lifting her eyes and hesitantly took a few steps forward, looking at the man\u2019s kind and amiable smile sitting on the seat of honor, but was in fact, actually looking at her with a disgusting and lecherous gaze.Ruan Jiaojiao had wanted to bring up this question several times. How was Qi Zhanfeng able to give birth to a son like Qi Shen with a face like that?If it was because the genes were complementary, was Qi Shen\u2019s mother a magnificent beauty?As the sect leader, Qi Zhanfeng\u2019s imposing strength made others tremble with fear. His strength that was capable of taking several lives in a mere matter of minutes made the people on the upright path of the Jianghu fear him.However, his natural disposition was loose and lecherous. He often lingered around the beds of several beauties all year and because of this, he wasn\u2019t able to conceal the wretchedness and obscenity in his bones.Ruan Jiaojiao thought to herself. In the plot, the original owner was drugged by Yuan Sannaing and delivered to Qi Zhanfeng, this couldn\u2019t have been done without Qin Zhanfeng\u2019s hand but even if the original owner knew this point, she could only suffer in silence and grit her teeth.As a follower of the demonic sect, if the demonic leader wanted her body, or wanted her to go through water and tread on fire, offering her life in sacrifice, she couldn\u2019t say a single word of refute.Thinking up until here, Ruan Jiaojiao somewhat missed the laws of modern society. Even though there was also a ruler of supremacy during that period, it wasn\u2019t as clear as day like this world.She currently had her head lowered, feigning cowardice, when she suddenly felt the ground spin and a gust of strong wind rolled her body forward in an instant and Ruan Jiaojiao immediately found herself in front of Qi Zhanfeng.Her dainty chin was lifted up by his finger and even scratched slightly.Ruan Jiaojiao cursed madly in her heart but still preserved the weak and delicate look on her face.\u201cJiaojiao has grown up to be a fine lady.\u201dQi Zhanfeng seemed to sigh, measuring her beautiful face with a fixated gaze.Ruan Jiaojiao bit her lip, her face appearing fearful of Qin Zhanfeng\u2019s imposingness.The man\u2019s big palm caressed her cheeks, making Ruan Jiaojiao feel a spell of chill. She secretly pondered if she was going to be taken advantage of by this old and ugly man because if that were the case, she would rather kill herself!Her heart and body belong to handsome men!!Fortunately, someone appeared just in time to lift her out of this predicament.\u201cSect Leader, your subordinate has news to report!\u201dA chilly yet sweet sounding male voice rang outside the door.Ruan Jiaojiao was inexplicably called over by Qin Zhanfeng but was interrupted by Bai Jingyan who had doused the intense atmosphere. She heaved a breath and left but the nerves that had just loosened, stretched taut again.She knew that the plot had just begun.Sigh!!Judging from Qin Zhanfeng\u2019s behavior, he had taken note of her.For the sake of protecting her chastity against Qin Zhanfeng\u2019s dirty claws, she couldn\u2019t stay at the demonic sect any longer.Wuuuu\u2026woe was she..If being born beautiful was a sin, then her sin was far too heavy!! And now, she was finally handed her retribution!!Ruan Jiaojiao anxiously packed her belongings and prepared to escape surreptitiously.It wasn\u2019t as if she had been completely unprepared for this unpredictable omen in time because she had at least saved some money and even brought along many concealed weapons, including poisoned darts and knockout drugs.The Jianghu <sup>3</sup> Jianghu means the underworld in ancient period, most commonly found in martial arts settings was dangerous! She needs to take precaution every step of the way!Before Ruan Jiaojiao left, she took one last look at Qi Shen\u2019s room.She knew that she could also Qi Shen for help but with the youth\u2019s character, she feared that he would have a falling out with his father and she wouldn\u2019t have a good end. She couldn\u2019t allow the young master to be exiled with her to the ends of the world!She had always felt that puppy love would never end well. Moreover, the skies were high and the seas were wide, perhaps there would be a little brother who was more handsome than Qi Shen, waiting for her. Besides, giving up an entire forest for the sake of a small tree had never been her style.System: \u201cTsk tsk\u2026Scum!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As expected, people of the demonic sect were shameless, including this little girl in front of him.Ye Hanzhou\u2019s thoughts turned and he retracted the sword in his hand, hiding the stolen antidotes properly before pressing the meridian on the girl\u2019s body so that she wouldn\u2019t be able to move. He then carried her up his shoulder and with the tap of his foot, he used qingong <sup>1</sup> Qingong is a type of martial arts where it makes the user very light on their feet, kind of like parkour , he disappeared into the boundless nightMotherf*cker!!Ruan Jiaojiao had gotten so dizzy on the journey she almost barfed her dinner out. She never expected to leave the demonic sect in such a manner.Ya Hanzhou rode on his prepared horse, whipping the reins to spur the horse to gallop at full speed. After finally sending the antidote on time and returning the favor of the past, he left just as fast as he came.Probably afraid of her demonic identity and in fear that she would try to do something, Ye Hanzhou fed her cartilage powder. As such, at this moment, her whole body laid weakly inside a room of a tavern.The plot had mentioned such a scene but without Chu Jiao interfering and giving directions, Ye Henzhou would\u2019ve never easily gotten the antidote, leading to a big battle breaking out in the demonic sect. He would\u2019ve also exchanged blows with Qin Zhanfeng and both sides would end up suffering losses.In the end, the injuries that Qin Zhanfeng\u2019s sustained would lead upon his ultimate death,Upon recalling that Ruan Jiaojiao had saved that perverted old geezer once, she couldn\u2019t help but feel nauseous. However, since she was captured instead of escaping on her own, it didn\u2019t constitute as betraying the demonic sect which meant that she had profited from a disaster.One had to know that the demonic sect\u2019s ways of punishment were very horrifying. Ruan Jiaojiao shivered at the thought of it.Ye Hanzhou pushed the doors open and came in, walking to the bedside with his brows scrunched lightly. Upon seeing Ruan Jiaojiao, he regarded her a being bit troublesome.\u201cSwordsman, we don\u2019t share any injustices or grievances, so please let me go. To tell you the truth, the moment you bumped into me, I was just about to escape the sect. I was originally an abandoned child in the town of Xuejia, and had been taken in by a follower of the demonic sect to be raised, but my innate good looks had brought me ill omens. The sect leader, Qi Zhanfeng drools at my beauty, harboring intentions to subjugate me, thus, to keep my life, I had planned to flee..\u201dRuan Jiaojiao looked at Ye Hanzhou and confessed sincerely.\u201cThat\u2019s why, even if I\u2019m a person of the demonic sect, I\u2019m actually a good person! I\u2019m unarmed and defenseless, I\u2019ve never left the demonic sect and I\u2019ve also never harmed anyone. In fact, I have been meaning to return to the right path.\u201dYe Hanzhou lowered his eyes and silently listened to Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s life experiences, the look on his face unchanging.In reality, he already believed about 70 to 80 percent of her words. The other party was but just a lady and he had already probed her out, concluding that she doesn\u2019t have any martial arts. When he came across her, she was carrying a burlap sack and was acting secretive. It did look like she was indeed planning to flee.However, the people of the demonic sect were deceitful in many ways, they loved to pilfer, rape, and resort to tricks. They were widely known to be double-crossers.Ye Hanzhou was not a person who could easily believe in others.\u201cSince Ye Hanzhou brought this lady out, taking her all the way to the west. Lady Ruan has decided to leave the demonic sect bcan this swordsman ask what other plans the lady has next?\u201dRuan Jiaojiao immediately answered honestly.\u201cI want to look for my birth parents.\u201dYe Hanzhou was a legend in the martial arts circle. The book didn\u2019t even reveal who his master was but from a young age, his crushing strength had already surpassed others. Since he didn\u2019t belong to the famous upright sect nor did he belong to the skewd evil sect, he was regarded as a talented man.However, this book was written from a female\u2019s point of view so naturally the main point was to talk about how the female lead fell in love with such a cool and strong male lead, mixed with the reign of terror and mysteriousness of the martial arts circles\u2019s element as a balance.Unfortunately, little darling Qi Shen who Ruan Jiaojiao liked, was this book\u2019s big villain.Ye Hanzhou didn\u2019t belong to any sect, meaning he was very idle.In any case, if he was idle then he\u2019d be idling. He decided to take Ruan Jiaojiao on her road to find her parents.Ruan Jiaojiao thought to herself.Hmph! What a superficial man! It must be because he fancied her for her beauty!!The system did not say anything to refute her in mockey which was a rarity.If Ruan Jiaojiao had really looked ugly, perhaps, Ye Hanzhou would have cast her away after knocking her out cold. Why else would he take a baggage like her on the road?The system and Ruan Jiaojiao did not guess wrongly but their thoughts were too skewed. Ye Hanzhou thought that since she was just a little girl, there would be no harm in taking her away, but now, she had become a burden.Moreover, the little girl was too beautiful. Who knew how many guys she would attract on the road? If he left her on the spot, that would simply be akin to casting a little white bunny amongst a pack of wolves.And so, before they had travelled far, Ye Hanzhou threw a set of male clothes at Ruan Jiaojiao, making her dress up as a young man.Low-key! Low-key!!Who would\u2019ve known that his action invited another trouble because in this world, the hobby of keeping catamites existed!Motherf*cker!

Moreover, by quite a lot of people too. They were currently amidst a busy market and there were many eyes around them. One careless move would very well cause them to fall into their trap.He didn\u2019t know what the other party\u2019s goal was but the feeling of being watched secretly was not nice.What was even more annoying was that after entering the tavern, they were informed that all the rooms had been rented out.Thinking that they might have to wander around the streets, Ruan Jiaojiao pouted, unhappiness written all over her face.The two people had been travelling together for quite a while so Ye Hanzhou was clear of the girl\u2019s character and had taken out a silver ingot, stuffing it in the shopkeeper\u2019s hand.The shopkeeper\u2019s eyes grew wide from the sight of money and he immediately asked an attendant to tidy up a reserved room for them.Ruan Jiaojiao entered the room without any qualms but Ye Hanzhou wavered. Once the attendant brought tea to the room, he then shut the door and left.One man and one woman were left alone.Ye Hanzhou looked at Ruan Jiaojiao who had climbed up the bed in exhaustion and spread out her limbs, thinking that sure enough, the people of the demonic sect didn\u2019t teach her any sense of propriety, and in all likelihood, these girls had no idea on how to follow established rules at home.\u201cBrother Ye, are you tired?\u201dRuan Jiaojiao suddenly sat up, staring at him with big watery eyes.Ye Hanzhou choked. The young girl\u2019s tied up hair had already been let loose. Her jet black hair was like satin, her lips were red and her teeth were white, her eyes shone brightly like colored glass, her tender face was void of any powder, her appearance making the sight of a hundred flowers pale in comparison.Seeing Ye Hanzhou blank out, Ruan Jiaojiao giggled. Whoever said beauty was not a deadly weapon? Even the male lead was struck with awe.She couldn\u2019t help but sigh. The original owner possessed such exceptional features yet she lived such a miserable and wretched life. How unlucky she was.The system thought to itself, that was because even though the body was the same, the soul inside was different. The original owner harbored great bitterness and deep hatred, so her character had always been slightly gloomy. Even if she tried to curry favor with someone else, she would always be a little careful. How could she be like you, living life so recklessly.Your shamelessness was able to bring out a hundred percent of the original owner\u2019s beauty, appearing like a true soul-tempting enchantress.Ruan Jiaojiao turned around on the bed, her slender jade hand patting the area beside her.\u201cBrother Ye, come over and sleep with me. Women of the Jianghu don\u2019t bother with trifles. In any case, if you and I kept this secret, no one would know about it. Moreover, I am without father and mother, so I don\u2019t really need to be concerned with keeping my purity.\u201dYe Hanzhou listened to Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s words and a sense of helplessness welled up once again. He realized that it wasn\u2019t that she didn\u2019t know about the boundaries between men and women but rather, she didn\u2019t care for it at all.He promptly stood up, unsure of why he was feeling a little vexed and threw his sleeves back, walking towards her.\u201cYou should go to sleep first. I\u2019ll come back tomorrow morning to resume our journey.\u201dAfter leaving these words, Ye Hanzhou then left.When midnight arrived, Ye Hanzhou who was in the tavern downstairs drinking wine, suddenly smiled. How could a silly little girl from the demonic sect stir his heart? How ridiculous.Within just a few short days of interaction, Ye Hanzhou had no choice but to admit that he was attracted by this demonic sect beauty.He had come across many girls, from daughters of families with literary reputation to girls coming from prestigious houses and aristocratic families, but he had never seen such a pretty and refreshing girl.She was lazy, gluttonous, and hated expending effort and feeling pain. After he had gotten familiar with her, she would take advantage of his weakness, her face very thick, proficient in acting coquettishly and dumb.Ye Hanzhou knew that he couldn\u2019t allow himself to continue being swept by her. Once they had arrived at Xiejia Town, he was going to find an excuse and leave.An hour later.Ye Hanzhou looked at the flushed girl. Her snow white lotus arms wrapped around his body, her eyes misty, and her expression vague. She rubbed against him impatiently and hungrily. The fire that arose in his abdomen accompanied with the alcohol, dulled his senses, his rationality gradually dissipating. Upon pressing the girl down on the bed, he then struggled for a while internally.While he was having an internal struggle, Ruan Jiaojiao pressed her wet lips against his thin lips, her tender tongue licking the corner of his mouth, eliciting an electrifying feeling. The sound of explosions rang in his head and Ye Hanzhou\u2019s last bit of rationality had been completely blown away.He trailed kisses down the girl\u2019s fair and soft body like raindrops hitting the ground, leaving fresh red marks. His hands that felt rough due to the thin calluses that developed from wielding the sword all year round, caressed her exquisite delicate skin. She was just like her name, tender and soft. She tasted sweet and fragrant, easily entrancing the man to wish he could swallow her whole.Even though he had done his best to completely suppress his desire, his member had already swollen to the point it started hurting. While Ye Hanzhou was undoing the girl\u2019s waistband, his fingers were quivering, and with a deep and husky voice, he asked.\u201cJiaojiao, are you truly willing to?\u201dJust as he asked these words, Ye Hanzhou cursed himself for being hypocritical when he clearly knew she was drugged by someone.Half an hour ago, he was downstairs drinking alcohol when his sharp ears picked up a faint moan. It was Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s voice that he had become quite familiar with by heart these past few days.Ye Hanzhou quickly put down his cup and rushed upstairs. Upon entering the room, he discovered that the street facing the window was open and not a soul could be found on the bed. Amidst the night sky, several men in black carried a burlap sack, jumping from roof to roof and vaulting over walls in haste.He immediately pursued them but didn\u2019t rush to rescue Ruan Jiaojiao. He followed their tracks, trying to find out who the mastermind was and arrived at the doors of a wealthy family from town.Ye Hanzhou kicked the door down and discovered a short and fat middle-aged man wearing official\u2019s clothes, preparing to untie the sack with eagerness.The gossip he had heard back in the tavern immediately surfaced to his head. Somebody had mentioned that the Official Lord of this town had a fetish for keeping pretty boys. Now that he surveyed his surroundings, he saw many toys placed on the bed and an odd scent burning in the room.Ye Hanzhou usually hated these kinds of filthy things so without uttering another word, he stabbed the man with his sword and took Ruan Jiaojiao away.However, as soon as he lifted Ruan Jiaojiao, he noticed something amiss with her. Her face was completely flushed and her actions seemed sluggish. When he twisted and turned with her in place with her in tow, she looked to be in extreme discomfort.She had been drugged!When this thought popped into Ye Hanzhou\u2019s mind, he couldn\u2019t help use his sword and give another few stabs on the ground, stopping only after confirming that the other person was dead.Such scum should never be left alive.After carrying Ruan Jiaojiao back to the room in the tavern, Ye Hanzhou had another sudden thought that came from deep within his heart.Perhaps, this was God\u2019s will.\u201cJiaojiao..\u201dYe Hanzhou breathed out, supporting Jiaojiao up the bed. Her figure was petite and delicate but the lumps of meat on her chest reminded him that she was a girl.Ruan Jiaojiao had already surrendered to her instincts and had clung onto Ye Hanzhou, rubbing herself in his arms, trying to relieve the heat in her body. At this moment, it felt like ice and fire were colliding against each other but a hazy scene suddenly surfaced in her head.In her memories a similar scene like this appeared before, however, at that time, the one who was drugged was someone else. What was that man called? She vaguely recalled that he was a premature ejaculator, cumming within a few strokes of her hand.\u201cHuo\u2026Huo\u2026\u201dShe murmured blankly.\u201cHuo Yuting\u2026.\u201d That\u2019s right! It sounds like this name!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This is a different world!After this, Ruan Jiaojiao had finally sobered up.W-\u2026What was going on?She observed the man pushing her down, his slender hands undoing her waistband. She could feel how clumsy his actions were and slow as well, and it was gradually irritating her. If his face weren\u2019t her type, and his body wasn\u2019t also smoking hot, clearly identifying him as a person trained in martial arts, that waistline, tsk tsk!Ruan Jiaojiao couldn\u2019t see well but her hands started to pull on Ye Hanzhou\u2019s waistband and she had done it so quickly and easily, peeling Ye Hanzhou\u2019s outer robe then inner clothes away, finally leaving only his trousers.The man\u2019s beautifully chiselled body bared before her. These pecs, abs, mermaid line and this..Ruan Jiaojiao drooled while raising her hand and starting to grope him madly.System, \u201c\u2026\u201d It was as if it hadn\u2019t snapped the host back to sobriety.Ye Hanzhou merely treated it as Ruan Jiaojiao acting under the influence of the drug, having lost her rationality so instead of consoling her urgent desires, when her little hand was about to dig into his trousers and take out his member, he held her wrist.\u201cDon\u2019t rush. We\u2019ll take it slow\u2026\u201dRuan Jiaojiao pouted and complained in dissatisfaction.\u201cYou\u2019re too slow..I want it!! I want it right now!!!\u201dAfter she said this, she undid her own waistband and realized that because of Ye Hanzhou\u2019s clumsy actions, her waistband had been tied tightly.This fool!Ruan Jiaojiao immediately took Ye Hanzhou\u2019s sword beside the bed and cut her waist band off, releasing the ties. She then leapt onto Ye Hanzhou like a starving tiger catching a goat.Just as she was about to take a big bite of this meat, Ye Hanzhou suddenly asked a question, rendering her stunned.\u201cWho\u2019s Huo Yuting?\u201dRuan Jiaojiao put on a stupefied expression.Huo Yuting? Wasn\u2019t he the male lead of some novel?She looked into the eyes of the male lead of this novel and saw the man watch her with a probing look, seemingly trying to figure out what this person meant to her.Ruan Jiaojiao, \u201c\u2026.\u201dHow was she going to answer this? What if she lied to him?And so, Ruan Jiaojiao pretended to act dumb, wrapping her arms around Ye Hanzhou\u2019s neck and giving him a hot kiss. She put on an urgent look influenced by the effects of the drug while at the same time, stuck her hand inside Ye Hanzhou\u2019s trousers, once again grasping his big c*ck, which to be more accurate, was rather more of a big motherf*cking roc spreading its wings, godd*mn!If Qi Shen\u2019s length was simply visible from his pants, then Ye Hanzhou\u2019s was simply terrifying!!As expected, male leads of the martial arts world\u2026.were too beastly!!Ruan Jiaojiao rubbed his pistol feeling entangled on the inside. She stimulated a lot of prec*m to leak out as lubrication, hoping that under the effects of the drug, she wouldn\u2019t be in so much pain.Now that the arrow was finally set on the bow, she could only steel her will!\u201cBrother Ye\u2026wi-\u2026will you please be a little gentler with me?\u201dRuan Jiaojiao blinked her wet eyes, her clothes in a disarray, appearing increasingly lovely. She laid on the bed as if she were being presented, her white body stripped of any clothes, the attractive and er*tic sight laying bare before Ye Hanzhou\u2019s eyes.She was now in her teenage years, her skin fair and tender, her figure petite and delicate. Her slender waist could be grasped with one hand and the only cloth remaining was a dudou, which only highlighted her allure.Her chest wasn\u2019t considered big as they were still growing. They looked like two little meat buns. Ye Hanzhou\u2019s breathing gradually turned slow, afraid that his appearance would frighten the little girl.He untied the knots of her dudou, taking particularly more care this time, and the pink-lilied, silk dudou became undone.Her jade body laid in a disarray, the naked Ruan Jiaojiao completely naked before him. The candle flame on the table flickered, casting a honey yellow color on her entire body. The two red cherries on her jade mounds perked up like pure and cute doves.Ye Hanzhou bent down, covering her tender bosoms with his hand and rubbing them gently. The little cherry turned even more erect under his palm. Ruan Jiaojiao couldn\u2019t help but moan, however, his lips crashed against hers, muffling the sounds and swallowing her moans.\u201cJiaojiao, spread your legs.\u201dYe Hanzhou still couldn\u2019t stop using a guiding teacher\u2019s tone with her. After all, in his heart, she was still a beauty who was lacking in discipline, but had captured his heart.Ruan Jiaojiao harrumphed. Even though she wasn\u2019t pleased with his attitude, she also felt slightly impatient. She spread her legs, revealing her honey-drenched pink seams.Ye Hanzhou was hostile to women but that didn\u2019t mean that he didn\u2019t understand these kinds of matters. He had travelled across the Jianghu, and even personally came across other people doing the deed.Seeing the pigs run was one thing but personally tasting the meat himself was a completely different experience.Upon aiming his member at the tiny slit, he was a little hesitant. Would this really small place be able to eat his little brother?Would it break her?However, this delectable piece of meat had already sent herself to his lips, even though he wasn\u2019t a skirt-chaser, he also wasn\u2019t someone like Liuxia Hui <sup>1</sup> Liuxia Hui: an ancient Chinese politician.a man of eminent virtue, and is said on one occasion to have held a lady in his lap without the slightest imputation on his moral character. , he slowly pressed his swollen rod into the slit.After sticking in half a head, he could already feel her tight passage. However, the scalp numbing pleasure already made him hate that he couldn\u2019t immediately ram the whole thing into the place of ecstasy.\u201cJiaojiao\u2026bear it for a while\u2026\u201dYe Hanzhou said huskily. He gripped Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s waist firmly and dropped his body, plunging in half of his length.\u201cAh..it hurts..\u201d Ruan Jiaojiao was already seeping in cold sweat, feeling a wave of pain wash over her, wishing that she could shrink back.Motherf*cker, this hurts so bad!!! She couldn\u2019t put up with it anymore!!!She started to struggle and seeing this, Ye Hanzhou knew she was feeling regret. However, how could he just give up halfway? As such, his finger made a tap.Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s body immediately became stiff.Ye Hanzhou realized that he had actually pressed on Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s meridian.However, even though the little girl seemed to have calmed down, in reality, he was also in pain. And so, he lowered his head and kissed Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s lips, comforting her softly.\u201cJiaojiao\u2026bear it for a while..I\u2019ll try my best to be gentle\u2026\u201dF*ck! You beast!!!Ruan Jiaojiao could feel his cock slowly continuing to delve further inside. Her face had already turned red but because her meridian was pressed, she was unable to move. Curse this motherf*cking martial arts world!!! Curse you!!This was simply torture!!The slower Ye Hanzhou moved, the more he got stuck. With jumbled thoughts, he pushed himself in strongly, his power terrifying.With this push, Ruan Jiaojiao could feel a strong force opening up her passage and piercing her deepest parts.This sour pleasure nearly made her faint from the pain!After this, a warm liquid flowed out from her cave, weeting the area the two people were joined at. Ruan Jiaojiao knew for sure that she was bleeding\u2026As expected, Ye Hanzhou frowned, however, he knew that it was common for girls to bleed on their wedding night. And so, he undid the hold on Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s acupoint and was just about to appease her.At this moment, the two people could be said to have completely joined together. Ye Hanzhou\u2019s meat stick directly poking the deepest parts of Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s flower pot.The instant Ruan Jiaojiao regained freedom in movement, she raised a hand and sent a slap towards Ye Hanzhou\u2019s handsome face.A crisp and sharp sound rang out, accompanied by Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s furious voice.\u201cYou must be so proud that your martial arts is so strong!! You bastard!!!\u201dIt was the first time for Ye Hanzhou to have received a slap but he didn\u2019t get angry at all. He knew that he was in the wrong and hugged Ruan Jiaojiao, coaxing her for a while.\u201cBe good\u2026I have a very good medicine with me. I\u2019ll put it on you later on and it wouldn\u2019t hurt anymore\u2026\u201dIn truth, after giving him a slap, Ruan Jiaojiao\u2018s anger had already been vented. She knew that she herself had also agreed to it and since Ye Hanzhou had been really gentle, if he didn\u2019t press on her acupoint, with the way she was struggling earlier, she could have been in even more pain so she might as well make a concerted effort.She wiped the tears trickling out the corner of her eyes and seeing that Ye Hanzhou remained unmoved, hugging her, and even whispering appeasing words in her ears, she grew impatient again.\u201cYou\u2019re already inside, at least move a little!\u201dThis was why she said that the ancient period where pornos didn\u2019t exist was annoying. They were extremely lacking in source materials so this male lead was no good at all!!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even if she endured it and let Ye Hanzhou stick it all the way in, the two people\u2019s first intercourse hadn\u2019t gone smoothly at all. Every time he moved, a piercing pain would envelop her. And if he didn\u2019t move, the feeling of being stuck at a deadlock would only vex her.After such a torturous ordeal, neither party gained any pleasure out of it.After Ye Hanzhou put the ointment on her, she weakly turned over and drifted off to sleep. Ye Hanzhou was also completely spent, not physically but mentally.Fortunately, even though Ye Hanzhou\u2019s bed skills weren\u2019t much to speak of, he was still considerate. He fed Ruan Jiaojiao a hearty meal and hired a carriage, allowing the two to continue their journey.In the next few days, Ye Hanzhou only booked a single room and the two would share the same bed but without any hanky panky ensuing, neither party making a move.On one hand, Ye Hanzhou had done this out of safety, worried that Ruan Jiaojiao would be kidnapped away by another pervert in the middle of the night. As such, staying beside her was the safest option. Besides, he wasn\u2019t the type to abide scrupulously and rigidly abide by etiquette like those from upright sects.On the other hand, he wanted to cultivate feelings with Ruan Jiaojiao and take her in as his wife.To take a girl from the Demonic Sect as his wife, people from the martial arts circles may perhaps may find it incomprehensible but Ye Hanzhou had always done things his way and never cared about how anyone looked at him.\u201cDid you just say you wanted to take me in as your wife?\u201dRuan Jiaojiao had just drunk a sip of tea and nearly choked upon hearing his words.Ye Hanzhou saw her put on a look of disbelief and had wanted to say something but Ruan Jiaojiao quickly waved her hands and interrupted him, saying.\u201cNo. I don\u2019t want to marry. If you\u2019re trying to take responsibility for what happened yesterday, there\u2019s really no need to! You already know how we from the Demonic Sect are. In any case, in your eyes, men are thieves and women are prostitutes, we can only think of evil and do evil, plus we simply have no moral integrity. Besides, Jianghu people never concerned themselves with such trifles. What happened that night was merely an accident, let\u2019s just pretend nothing ever happened between us.\u201dRuan Jiaojiao\u2019s flurry of words completely made Ye Hanzhou stunned.\u201cBrother Ye. Truthfully, I didn\u2019t have parents when I was young so I\u2019m really grateful for your care during this period. I think of you like a brother so can you think of me as a sister too?\u201dRuan Jiaojiao blinked her pure and innocent eyes, looking expectantly at Ye Hanzhou.System, \u201c\u2026.\u201dTo call the other party as brother after sleeping with him, its host sure is amazing(ly shameless)!Ye Hanzhou fell into silence.He had imagined her reaction several times but had never expected she would respond like this.Seeing Ye Hanzhou remain silent, Ruan Jiaojiao pursed her lips and called out sweetly.\u201cBrother Ye, tomorrow we\u2019ll reach Xie Jia Town. I\u2019ll be looking for my parents so you should attend to your matters. The road to Jianghu is far, if fate allows it, we may meet again.\u201dYe Hanzhou mulled over the last sentence she spoke. Did she imply that she didn\u2019t want be together with him?Did she not like him at all?The male lead was deeply hurt.In the dead of the night, Ye Hanzhou sat alone in the tavern downstairs drinking alcohol. The more he drank the more he became gloomy, an impatient knot forming in the pit of his stomach, difficult to dispel.Ye Hanzhou travelled around the country and came across many pretty daughters and several beauties. Many fell in love with him at first sight, hinting or indicating their intentions clearly. Some even audaciously and boldly cast aside their timidness and confessed their feelings to him yet his heart remained unmoved like still water from beginning to end.He assumed that he had an inherently cold character, in all likelihood, used to being alone, but he never thought that he would fall so easily putty in another Demonic Sect girl\u2019s hand.Her scowls, her smile, her pouts and her mutterings, all pulled at his heartstrings.However, he never expected to have his love unrequited.Ye Hanzhou bitterly drank alcohol alone. Since the situation was like this, why did she agree to sleep with him?Did he take advantage of her?But as a girl, did she really not care for her chastity? She had already cooked rice with him <sup>1</sup> Cooking rice is a chinese euphemism for having already done the deed , how was she going to marry in the future?Ye Hanzhou sank into endless conflicting thoughts whereas Ruan Jiaojiao at this moment, did not fare any better.She was occupying the whole bed alone and was originally having an exceptionally sweet slumber.However, she never expected that the quilt covering her would suddenly disappear, a cold chill assaulting her slender petite body, waking her from her sleep.Ruan Jiaojiao opened her eyes and saw a man standing at the side of the bed, watching her, and her head turned blank for a moment.\u201cEnvoy Bai?\u201dF*ck! How did Bai Jingyan find her?! And why hasn\u2019t Ye Hanzhou sensed him at all?!Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s drowsiness disappeared in an instant and she immediately sat up, staring blankly at Bai Jingyan as her brain started working quickly.\u201cI\u2026I\u2019ve been kidnapped!! I didn\u2019t flee out of my own volition!!\u201dAfter settling on an idea, she immediately put it into action, leaping over to hug Bai Jingyan\u2019s waist and crying aggrievedly.However, contrary to her expectations, Bai Jingyan didn\u2019t move a single jot, turning Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s scalp numb. She had spent a lot of effort currying favor with this fellow in the past and even though he did treat her well, he had deep thoughts and the care he had towards her didn\u2019t reach Qi Shen\u2019s level.Recalling that the sect people mentioned that Bai Jingyan was cold and ruthless, dealing with people without any mercy, Ruan Jiaojiao earnestly tried to squeeze out a few sad tears from her eyes.\u201cBrother Bai\u2026\u201dShe softly called out but didn\u2019t expect to receive a cold snort from Bai Jingyan in response.\u201cBrother Qi, Brother Ye\u2026exactly how many brothers do you have?\u201dRuan Jiaojiao was rendered stunned upon hearing Bai Jingyan\u2019s slightly mocking words.\u201cDon\u2019t assume that I didn\u2019t know you crept into Qi Shen\u2019s bed every night. Even if you were young and ignorant back then, clueless about the distance between man and woman, what of the current situation? Jiaojiao sure is skilled, with just one hand, you were able to hook in the almighty Ye Hanzhou whose 'sharp sword could sweep across 19 states\u201d!Following this, Bai Jingyan\u2019s cold hand pinched her chin, making her look straight into his dark abyss-like eyes and as though her acupoint was pressed, her body turned stiff, unable to move a single muscle.\u201cSay, if that brat Qi Shen knew that his Jiaojiao had slept with a barbarian, what do you think he\u2019ll do?\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013T/N: YANDERE.

Basically, as long as she doesn\u2019t touch his bottom line, he would still do as she asked. And so, even if he harbored a mixture of love and hate for her, he wouldn\u2019t take her life without blinking an eye like in the original plot.He wouldn\u2019t be able to do so\u2026However, even if she managed to escape the death penalty, it wouldn\u2019t be easy to continue living a peaceful life.Ruan Jiaojiao shuddered at the thought and raised her head to look at Bai Jingyan.Just as she expected, this wasn\u2019t simple at all. He actually threatened her and even knew a lot as if he knew her in and out.\u201cJingyan..\u201dRuan Jiaojiao called out in a probing manner and seeing that Bai Jingyan didn\u2019t react in disgust, she continued climbing him up like a pole, wrapping her arms around Bai Jingyan\u2019s neck and staring at his cold, handsome face.His body still carried the chilliness of the night and she only wore a thin unlined garment. Due to the movement of raising her hands, the wide sleeves slid down, revealing two fair lotus arms.Under the white moonlight, it was as if her tender skin was smeared with a layer of powder, it was like soft tofu that had just been freshly made, a clear and sparkling translucence that could be broken with just one poke.Ruan Jiaojiao parted her red lips slightly, nearing Bai Jingyan\u2019s chin and pressing a kiss before sticking out a pink little tongue and licking.\u201cThen can I beg you not to tell him?\u201dThe system who was eating popcorn, watched with relish.Its host was really testing the limits of her doom everyday.\u201cThen what do I gain?\u201dBai Jingyan didn\u2019t seem to be the slightest bit moved by her beauty at all but his big palm grasped Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s slender waist, the strength he exerted increasing, as if he was about to crush her waist.Ruan Jiaojiao tiptoed and leaned closer to him, pecking his thin cold lips.\u201cJingyan, please\u2026.\u201dBai Jingyan\u2019s eyes gradually turned dark.\u201cCome back with me.\u201d He said curtly and forcefully, lifting her up in one motion.\u201cNo! I can\u2019t go back, the sect leader he\u2026\u201d Ruan Jiaojiao revealed a discomfited expression.\u201cThat old pervert. I didn\u2019t think he would be so impatient as to lay a hand on you this early.\u201d Bai Jingyan evidently showed an expression of understanding.\u201cThere\u2019s also another matter. I want to find my birth parents.\u201dSince he finally started speaking, Ruan Jiaojiao actually liked conversing with Bai Jingyan this effortlessly.The two people then came to a decision that Ruan Jiaojiao would cast Ye Hanzhou aside the next day and Bai Jingyan would accompany her to find her parents.With the protection of a master such as Envoy Bai himself, Ruan Jiaojiao felt a lot more at ease.However, for unknown reasons, Ye Hanzhou had poured himself a little much and had become drunk. He pushed the bedroom doors open and saw Ruan Jiaojiao sitting on the table, drinking tea.Ruan Jiaojiao was taken aback and only saw Ye Hanzhou striding towards her.\u201cB-\u2026Brother Ye?\u201dYe Hanzhou stopped before her and looked down at her disdainfully, his gaze cold and sharp, carrying with it the might of a legendary genius.\u201cWho are you calling your brother?\u201d He grabbed her wrist viciously.\u201cA-\u2026.Are you drunk?\u201dRuan Jiaojiao measured Ye Hanzhou\u2019s appearance and immediately realized that he was pretending to act mad under the pretext of being drunk.Sure enough, Ye Hanzhou hooked one arm around her waist and pulled her into his arms.The teacup in Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s hand fell down, causing the contents to splash out, wetting the two people\u2019s clothes.Ye Hanzhou buried his face into the crook of her neck and took a deep whiff as if he was trying to take in the charming scent the girl\u2019s body emitted.\u201cJiaojiao\u2026\u201dHis warm breath sprayed on her neck, eliciting an itch in Ruan Jiaojiao. Her body quivered for a moment before turning limp uncontrollably.How hateful! That was her most sensitive spot.Ruan Jiaojiao was originally a l*sty person, however, this body was too delicate. Her last experience didn\u2019t end too well and had even turned bloody and tragic; not to mention, Ye Hanzhou\u2019s skills were also pretty bad, hence, she had been recuperating her body and behaving herself, not provoking him.Should she\u2026try it again?Ruan Jiaojiao thought to herself. Even if it hurt, it wouldn\u2019t hurt as much as the first time right?Just as she was hesitating, Ye Hanzhou had already carried her to bed and began to take off his own robe, gradually revealing his sexy figure before her very eyes.Ruan Jiaojiao gulped and suddenly fumbled around, taking out a picture book from underneath a pillow.\u201cBrother Ye\u2026do you want to study this book first\u2026.\u201dYe Hanzhou may have been pretending to be drunk but he was actually sober. Seeing Ruan Jiaojiao without any intention of pushing him away, he calmed down. Even though he thought it odd that she would suddenly ask him to study a book, he still took it and flipped it open for a look.It turned out to be an er*tic picture book!Ye Hanzhou closed the book and narrowed his eyes, pressing Ruan Jiaojiao under him.\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not going to take a look?\u201d Ruan Jiaojiao reached out a hand to resist him, remaining firm on her stance.\u201cBefore I came over, I already looked over it.\u201d He captured her ruddy lips and answered vaguely in between their lips.Ruan Jiaojiao reacted back, hooking her lips into a smile.Good. This child shows promise!The red candles on the table flickered as the temperature surrounding the two entangled bodies grew hotter, an ambiguous atmosphere forming.Ruan Jiaojiao was aroused, staring at Ye Hanzhou\u2019s cold and handsome face. She thought to herself that there wasn\u2019t actually anything bad about the martial arts world and instead, it was quite fresh.Take this supremely honorable and righteous male lead as an example, he was a type that didn\u2019t even exist in the two previous worlds.Then, there was Qi Shen who was ruthless and cruel to the whole world, only showing his caring side towards her, and she liked him a lot as well.She also found Bai Jingyan\u2019s mysterious black-bellyness tempting to conquer.Ruan Jiaojiao turned breathless from Ye Hanzhou\u2019s kiss, her whole face turning red, her body turning limp. When her gaze suddenly shifted upwards at the beams of the ceiling, she nearly wet herself.She had almost forgotten that Bai Jingyan was the best at concealing himself in the story. His martial arts was no inferior to Qi Zhanfeng. As long as he concealed himself and Ye Hanzhou continued to only ponder how to eat her fully into his belly, he wouldn\u2019t discover another presence in the room.Ruan Jiaojiao exchanged a glance with the black-clothed Bai Jingyan who was hiding behind the beam and her petite body quivered. Ye Hanzhou had already pulled her lapels open, revealing her pink dudou.\u201cD-..Don\u2019t..\u201dThis Bai Jingyan was watching from above so even if Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s l*st was aroused, it was also just as quickly quenched by a basin of cold water, all her wishful thoughts extinguished.However, she had forgotten that men were animals who were driven by the desire of their lower half. She abruptly pushed Ye Hanzhou away, forgetting that her actions only added oil to the fire, making Ye Hanzhou tear her dudou off and bend down, taking the tips of her mounds quickly into his mouth.Ruan Jiaojiao was stripped half-naked by Ye Hanzhou and knew that Bai Jingyan was witnessing the whole process of events. Under his glare, she quickly covered her chest, obstructing the sight of her flaky bunnies, feeling miserable at this moment.If she struggled, Ye Hanzhou would only grow more beastly. If she didn\u2019t struggle, would she really have to go for a round with Ye Hanzhou right in front of Bai Jingyan?No! In this state, Ye Hanzhou wouldn\u2019t even be satisfied with just doing it once!!Ruan Jiaojiao was so anxious, tears nearly squeezed out of her eyes. She started to twist her waist in refute of Ye Hanzhou\u2019s advances.\u201cBrother Ye\u2026don\u2019t do this\u2026Wuu..\u201dYe Hanzhou plugged Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s jabbering lips, sucking and biting them. Her lips had turned into a bright color from his desire and she looked at him with watery eyes, appearing weak and delicate. Yet, this had only spurned the man\u2019s inner beast, his thirst and hunger burning impatiently as he itched to press her down and ruthlessly play with her.Ruan Jiaojiao struggled even harder and even used a bit of martial arts but how could her strength even be comparable to his. She was easily suppressed and turned around, his big palm giving her supple buttocks a light pat.\u201cLittle Minx!\u201dDamn it!Ruan Jiaojiao\u2018s hand were held behind her back by Ye Hanzhou, her face buried in the pillow, unable to see Bai Jingyan any longer.She could hear him taking off his trousers and his twitching hot rod was already sliding in between her legs. Seeing that she was about to be entered from behind, she immediately became anxious.Who cares about keeping face anymore!!Being watched by Bai Jingyan as Ye Hanzhou gave it to her was too damn exciting!! She couldn\u2019t stand it anymore!!It was unknown if someone had heard of the voice in her heart but a cough suddenly resounded from the ceiling.Ye Hanzhou immediately covered the naked Ruan Jiaojiao with a blanket in the blink of an eye.And Bai Jingyan flew down from above.Even though Ye Hanzhou looked calm, big waves were surging in his heart. He knew that the other party\u2019s martial arts weren\u2019t beneath him, otherwise, how would he not have detected him?As expected, the words \u201cThere will always be people better than you\u201d held water.Ye Hanzhou calmly tied the ribbon of his robe and looked at Bai Jingyan. The two people locked eyes, sparks going off between them, running to all directions.\u201cAre you a member of the Demonic Sect?\u201dBai Jingyan\u2019s clothes and temperament revealed clues.\u201cEnvoy Bai\u201d Ruan Jiaojiao called out, as if affirming the identity Ye Hanzhou had concluded.Even though Ruan Jiaojiao was covered with a quilt, not baring the slightest skin at all, Ye Hanzhou continued to block her sight.He cared very greatly for her!Thinking that this person had now seen Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s naked body, he was instantly overcome with bloodthirstiness to gouge the other person\u2019s eyes out!Ruan Jiaojiao also felt like she was doomed at this moment.She didn\u2019t know that Bai Jingyan had such a fetish. The two of them had already clearly come to an agreement but she was unaware that he had deceived her and actually hadn\u2019t left, peeping from the beams in the ceiling.\u201cJiaojiao, come here.\u201dBai Jingyan raised his lips to form a faint smile, instructing Ruan Jiaojiao.How could Ye Hanzhou withstand this provocation? He immediately pulled out his sword and aimed it, rushing towards Bai Jingyan.However, in the blink of an eye, the two had already exchanged a hundred blows. The bedroom was unable to withstand such a fierce battle and soon appeared as though a typhoon had passed by.Seeing that the situation did not bode well, Ruan Jiaojiao pretended to be unaware of this matter like an innocent bystander and simply fainted.T/N: Sorry for the one month no update, I just started work last month and am now considering to go sign-up for a sugar daddy app :\u2019) Just kidding.

    "Chapter 54": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Being PAPA\u2019d Every Time I TransmigrateChapter 52 [3rd World 9] Little White RabbitPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cJiaojiao!\u201dWhen Ye Hanzhou saw Ruan Jiaojiao faint, he was immediately rendered stunned and during this moment of weakness, Bai Jingyan shot out a dart. Even if Ye Hanzhou was able to dodge it in time, it still managed to graze past his arm.The concealed weapons that the Demonic Sect people used were naturally laced with poison by Luo Yunlou.Now that Ye Hanzhou had been afflicted, he quickly sealed his meridians to prevent the poison from spreading but at the same time, his movements had turned sluggish.\u201cSwordsman Ye, even if you weren\u2019t injured, there\u2019s no guarantee you can win against me in the battle of martial arts. Now, the results of this battle have already been decided. What\u2019s going on? Did you really fall in love with this little girl?\u201dOnce Bai Jingyan had injured Ye Hanzhou, he didn\u2019t continue attacking him, walking towards Ruan Jiaojiao instead. He reached out a finger to probe her and realized that the girl\u2019s breathing had suddenly turned quick, evidently indicating that she was pretending to be unconscious. With this realization, his lips hooked up into a faint smile.Ye Hanzhou lowered his gaze, knowing clearly that Bai Jingyan was granting him an opportunity to escape.Envoy Bai of the Demonic Sect killed without blinking an eye, however, he would also at times, leave a road of retreat whenever he felt like it. It was also because of this that he was rumored in the Jianghu as a frightening person, to the point that it was said his power was no inferior to Qi Zhenfeng.Ye Hanzhou\u2019s gaze landed on the unconscious girl\u2019s body and he promptly calmed down. How could he have not noticed that she was pretending to be unconscious?He smiled bitterly. Concern for another led to a chaotic heart.He didn\u2019t think that as someone who was all alone in this world, he actually had someone he cared for, creating a weakness for himself. The more ironic thing was that she was a member of the Demonic Sect, and so perhaps, he may even let the other party stab him.Ye Hanzhou\u2019s grip on his sword tightened, his gaze akin to a sharp knife, parked at Bai Jingyan\u2019s face.While the two men were having a face-off, Ruan Jiaojiao noticed that the air was odd and also realized that she had been exposed. Embarrassed, she could no longer continue the act and leapt up to her feet, wrapping her arms around Bai Jingyan and shouting at Ye Hanzhou.\u201cBrother Ye, go quickly. Envoy Bai would never harm me.\u201dBai Jingyan raised a brow and jeered.\u201cBrother Ye?\u201dMotherf*cker!Go! Why hasn\u2019t this idiot left yet!!!However, Ruan Jiaojiao ignored Bai Jingyan\u2019s ridicule and looked straight at Ye Hanzhou. Was the male lead not leaving? Was he trying to send himself to death\u2019s doors?!If the male lead died then wouldn\u2019t this mean the end of the story?F*ck!Fortunately, Bai Jingyan did not seem to care for Ye Hanzhou. Instead, he took greater interest in her attitude.At this time, he casually picked up a book on the bed, the pages of the book had already become slightly crinkled, \u00a0which was obviously the result from the two people\u2019s tumbling on the bed.Bai Jingyan\u2019s sender fingers turned the pages one by one as Ruan Jiaojiao continued to cling to him from behind, watching Envoy Bai turn the pages of the erotic picture book she had bought in front of her.\u201cI didn\u2019t think that Jiaojiao would be so interested in the matters between man and woman. I originally thought Jiaojiao was still young but I didn\u2019t think you\u2019ve already grown into a lady.\u201d Bai Jingyan said meaningfully.Did Ruan Jiaojiao feel ashamed because of these words?Of course not!He had already seen her getting undressed earlier so what else did she have to lose? She wrapped her legs around Bai Jingyan\u2019s waist and climbed his body like a monkey on a tree.\u201cI was just casually trying out my tricks on him.\u201dAs she said this, she put on a charming front with Bai Jingyan, her eyes misty and her appeal oozing out.For the sake of saving the male lead\u2019s life, for the sake of not letting her mission fail, she was putting in her best effort!Hearing this, Ye Hanzhou\u2019s body froze. He looked at her promiscuous appearance with a complicated gaze, feeling very entangled.\u201cSwordsman Ye, women of the Jianghu don\u2019t sweat the small details. Even though we\u2019ve spent a night together, the upright and evil sects will never reconcile like fire and water, however, Envoy Bai is willing to overlook your life on my behalf so you should quickly leave!\u201dAfter she said her piece, she waved her hand at him, even putting on an impatient expression.In the end, like a monk that had entered a meditative state, Ye Hanzhou looked at her without blinking an eye, unmoving.Ruan Jiaojiao grew frustrated. She had already been putting in her best effort but this male lead was really set on walking the road of death.At this time, even though Bai Jingyan remained expressionless, the hand he had inside his sleeve moved slightly, alerting Ruan Jiaojiao that he was about to do something.Even though Ye Hanzhou had just avoided a concealed attack, he had still gotten hurt with a poison-laced dart. Even if he had sealed his meridians, she was afraid that he wouldn\u2019t be as lucky for the attack that was about to come next.Ruan Jiaojiao panicked. Wrapping her arms around Bai Jingyan\u2019s neck, she swiftly turned around, arriving in front of him and cupping Bai Jingyan\u2019s face, kissing him.\u201cBrother Bai\u2026Good Brother\u2026My heart only has you alone\u2026\u201dRuan Jiaojiao kissed Bai Jingyan, not forgetting to confess her deep affections for him.\u201cQi Shen is a young master so I merely wanted to obtain his protection. You know that as an only girl, Father Ruan is not often in the sect so I was always bullied\u2026\u201dSeeing Bai Jingyan remain silent, Ruan Jiaojiao reached towards his waist, holding his big hands and placing one on the left side of her chest.\u201cFeel my heart, there\u2019s no one else but you!!\u201dRuan Jiaojiao\u2019s eyes immediately turned misty as she stared incomparably sincerely at Bai Jingyan.Even though he knew that the girl was trying to protect that man surnamed Ye, this was Bai Jingyan\u2019s first time hearing a woman confess to him so it was hard for him not to feel happy.Besides, his hands that were always stained with blood were now covering the girl\u2019s dainty bosom. The soft fresh feeling it brought, piqued his interest, and an excitement that came not from killing someone else, arose from his abdomen.Bai Jingyan was not a charitable person. He had committed innumerable murders, killing men, killing women, and even killing those who tried to seduce him to save their own skin. In his perspective, the values of beauties were equivalent to that of ants and dust, easily able to end their life without blinking an eye.However, this little girl had sparked his interest, approaching him on her own initiative with persistent efforts.The her back then was cute and cuddly like a sticky candy. Whenever she would approach him, she would cling onto his leg and ask him to carry her.Bai Jingyan who was just a teen back then, had already established prestige within the sect through his ruthless methods and talent in martial arts. He was like a bloodthirsty lone wolf on the verge of reaching adulthood and had already bared his sharp fangs. Aside from this little girl, everyone else in the sect didn\u2019t dare get close to him.However, Bai Jingyan knew that this little girl didn\u2019t treat only him specially. She also curried favor with that brat Qi Shen and even shared the same bed with him every night, sleeping together.Bai Jingyan didn\u2019t think much of it. He didn\u2019t dislike her approach and if she approached anyone else, he also didn\u2019t care.However, when his original indifference was tainted with the matters between man and woman, once the little girl who still smelled of milk had grown into a charming little lady, the beast that Bai Jingyan had been suppressing for many years was hooked by her in an instant.Particularly when the scene of her entanglement with Ye Hanzhou in bed resurfaced in his head in a flash. If it were him, he would have no doubtedly do her hard, ravaging her to death and back, making sure that her little mouth wouldn\u2019t stop screaming \u201cbrother\u201d sweetly.Only he could be her brother while the rest of them can go to hell!!Translator Little Potato\u2019s Note:Hi Potats here, engagements (comments, likes and hearts) last chapter was really sad, it was around 0.2% of pageviews lol so here to give an incentive.

Bear it, my ass!!She knew that Luo Yunlou was extremely adept at creating poison and had also seen the pitiful state of someone suffering from the poison, inches away from death, however, she didn\u2019t think that she herself would meet such a day!In the time it took to completely burn an incense stick before, Ruan Jiaojiao first noticed Bai Jingyan\u2019s killing intent towards Ye Hanzhou. Thinking that the male lead could not die, she immediately came up with a plan and just as Bai Jingyan was about to take action, she leapt over and took the poisonous dart.Bai Jingyan was stupefied, Ye Hanzhou was stunned whereas Ruan Jiaojiao herself was astonished!!Motherf*cker!She fumbled around on her back, only feeling a warm red liquid.Ouch!There were no tears on her face but on the inside, she was about to have a breakdown, finding it hard to believe that she herself had done such a foolish thing.Since she had already taken the blade for the male lead, she might as well grit her teeth and continue her act.And so, Ruan Jiaojiao bled in Ye Hanzhou\u2019s arms, her eyes turning misty as she bore the pain and affectionately told Ye Hanzhou.\u201cLeave quickly!!\u201dThe scene of the beauty rescuing the hero touched Ye Hanzhou. He instantly emitted the intense halo of the male lead and carried Ruan Jiaojiao, jumping out of the window.Once Bai Jingyan had recovered his senses, he immediately gave chase. Ya Hanzhou rode a horse and quickly dashed away with Ruan Jiaojiao in tow like lightning, bursting out with astonishing power, escaping into the dense forest and successfully throwing off Bai Jingyan.At this moment, Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s face had already turned bloodless from pain, her whole person seemed as if she was fished out from water, seeping in sweat. She felt herself hovering between life and death\u2026Even if she didn\u2019t die from poison, she would eventually die from the pain.On the inside, she cried out madly for the system!Quickly save this granny! This granny is about to die!!Ye Hanzhou could feel her condition worsening in his arms and quickly pulled on the reins to stop.\u201cJiaojiao!\u201d\u201cMy pouch\u2026.\u201dRuan Jiaojiao endured the pain and grit her teeth, reminding Ye Hanzhou. In the beginning, afraid that she would try out something funny, Ye Hanzhou had taken her stuff away from her.Ye Hanzhou quickly jumped off his horse and took out the belongings she was carrying with her.His fingers trembled constantly, feeling a sense of panic and helplessness he\u2019d never felt before.When he heard her say that she was just playing around casually with him, seeing how frivolously he treated that man, his heart immediately turned cold, saying that this was to be expected. She was a girl from the demonic sect, how could she truly give out her heart?However, he didn\u2019t expect that she would block that poisonous dart for him without any hesitation.\u201cJiaojiao\u2026I won\u2019t let anything happen to you\u2026you\u2019re going to be fine..\u201dAfter feeding Ruan Jiaojiao the medicine, Ye Hanzhou held her tightly in his arms as though he was holding the only treasure in the world.At this moment, his heart was mixed with all sorts of feelings: agony, anxiety, worry, touch. All these emotions nearly overwhelmed him. He held Ruan Jiaojiao as if she was the most important person in his life.In reality, Ruan Jiaojiao also felt as if there was no hope in the world. She took out a couple poison absolving pills and popped them into her mouth. If it weren\u2019t because she was devoid of energy right now, she would\u2019ve given Ye Hanzhou a big slap.She had already asked him to leave so he should\u2019ve left by himself. Why did he have to insist on bringing her with him and even getting on a horse. If she could have a choice, she would\u2019ve wanted to go with Bai Jingyan!!To change the bell, one must find the person who tied it in the first place. This meant that only Bai Jingyan must carry the antidote to the dart he had shot out!Hearing her silent curses, the system couldn\u2019t help but tsk in disapproval. The male lead\u2019s belly-full of affections had all been fed to a dog.The two people hid inside the forest for a night and Ruan Jiaojiao who had nearly lost half of her life, was finally able to get out of her heavy predicament.System: \u201cThis is why they say that only the good die young.. <sup>1</sup> The full chinese phrase is \u597d\u4eba\u4e0d\u9577\u547d\uff0c\u798d\u5bb3\u907a\u5343\u5e74. It\u2019s a satirical phrase that means that those who try to do good end up dying early due to bad people\u2019s deeds whereas bad people are always able to escape being punished by law due to power, connections, resources etc.If they wanted to avoid being tracked down by Bai Jingyan, they naturally couldn\u2019t go to Xuejia Town. Ye Hanzhou was also injured so he decided to take Ruan Jiaojiao to the Free Manor.Upon hearing where they were going, the listless Ruan Jiaojiao instantly became a little excited.The Free Manor was the territory under the current head of the Martial Arts Alliance Head Lu Yuanpeng.She could even meet the female lead, Lu Xueyan.The system asked her secretly.What do you want to meet the female lead for? Aren\u2019t you scared of the strong attractive force between the male lead and the female lead?Ruan Jiaojiao leaned weakly in Ye Hanzhou\u2019s arms, shutting her eyes in recuperation. After hearing its words, she put on a smile but did not speak.Worried of the jolting caused by riding a horse, Ye Hanzhou rented a cart. At this moment, he swept a gentle and affectionate look at the young girl in his arms, wrapping her tightly in a woolen blanket which revealed only her pale face, her beautiful and exquisite appearance tinged with exhaustion and haggardness. Darkness flitted across the depth of his eyes and his heart clenched fiercely in distress.\u2026.\u201cLady Ruan, why do you look unwell?\u201dRuan Jiaojiao turned her head and met the current Martial Arts Alliance Head Lu Yuanpeng\u2019s eyes. She covered her lips and coughed lightly, scrunching her brows.\u201cThank you for Leader Lu\u2019s concern. I feel a lot better, and may have merely caught a chill last night.\u201dThe beauty\u2019s brows were dark and slender, her appearance gorgeous, her glances were like autumn water, making one hate that they couldn\u2019t drown in them.She wore a lotus root colored attire, her waist akin to a weak willow. Her lips parted slightly, revealing pearly whites.Her beauty was picturesque and pleasing to the eye, making Lu Yuanpeng\u2019s heart feel itchy.Even if Lu Yuanpeng knew that this woman seemed to have a close relationship with Ye Hanzhou, he couldn\u2019t stop himself from wishing that he could get close to her.However, Ruan Jiaojiao merely cursed on the inside. This old pervert was so shameless!She was younger than his unmarried daughter Lu Xueyan and he actually lusted after her.However, if he didn\u2019t have such a perverted character, why else would he have married her who came from an unknown background, as his concubine back in the original plot.After living in the free villa for several days, Ruan Jiaojiao somewhat sympathized with Lu Xueyan\u2019s circumstances and understood why she was in a hurry to get out of her predicament. For the sake of getting her father\u2019s attention, she bit at the original owner, revealing her identity as a witch from the demonic sect.Lu Yuanpeng was different from Qi Zhanfeng who only had Qi Shen as his son. Apart from having an official wife, Lu Yuanpeng had also taken in many concubines and has hence, sired many heirs.Some of his concubines were sent by other factions bounded in exchange for benefits where some of the others he had married for their beauty.Lu Xueyan\u2019s mother was the kind that was not doted on by Lu Yuanpeng because she was sent by another faction for an alliance. In truth, she was quite a delicate and pretty girl back in her years but she didn\u2019t know how to strive for affection and act coquettish and was naturally snubbed by Lu Yuanpeng.That was why even though the female lead was known as the Martial Arts Alliance\u2019s daughter, in reality, she was just a normal lady who would carefully watch how the other reacted since young and has experienced hardship everywhere. Because of this, the female lead\u2019s ambition grew, birthing the desire to practice a peerless martial arts and excel in the field.While feigning civilities with Lu Yuanpeng, Ruan Jiaojiao saw Ye Hanzhou being pestered by Lu Xueyan for advice on how to train.Ruan Jiaojiao couldn\u2019t help but sigh.This father and daughter pair really wanted to break them apart just after they had managed to flee from trouble\u2026System: \u201c\u2026.\u201dIt suddenly wanted to spit out \u2018What the heck was going on?\u2019\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Author: I can\u2019t seem to stop myself from going off the plot..Did you forget that this is supposed to be a smut story?T/N: Ah yes, whenever an author goes into historical/cultivation arc, it\u2019s hard for them not to put in some plot. I don\u2019t mind the bit of plot tho, sometimes translating too much smut corrodes my brain. :>Thanks to all the comments last chapter, made me happy reading them now after work~ As a special gesture for feeding potato\u2019s ego, I\u2019ll be sending you guys an uncensored version of chapter 55 through your mails at the same time the public release of the chapter comes out~PS.

Why not stay a few more days in the villa? Besides, I\u2019ve heard that there\u2019s been changes going on in the demonic sect, the Jianghu is about to lose peace.\u201dLu Yuanpeng was considered to be on good terms with Ye Hanzhou. Even though the two people had quite a large age gap between them, within the martial arts circle that used strength as the deciding factor, this was why Lu Yuanpeng treated him as a brother.Taking into account the reputation of her daughter, Ye Hanzhou introduced Ruan Jiaojiao as his friend\u2019s little sister.Ruan Jiaojiao showed not an inkle of interest in the contents of the conversation the two men had. Noticing that she looked bored, Ye Hanzhou immediately found an excuse to ward off Lu Yuanpeng and had intended to take Ruan Jiaojiao on a walk in the villa to dispel her boredom but was clung onto by Lu Xueyan.Being a woman, Ruan Jiaojiao naturally saw that Lu Xueyan\u2019s motives were impure.Ye Hanzhou was outstanding and handsome, his sword-play was unrivalled in the martial arts circle, so she didn\u2019t think it surprising that the female lead fell in love with him at first glance.However, everything has its order of arrival, this golden thigh was clearly already someone else\u2019s possession and now that the female lead was sticking onto him, Ruan Jiaojiao naturally felt unhappy.Once she was upset, the male lead shouldn\u2019t even think of having an easy time!As such, she worked Ye Hanzhou hand and feet, calling him every time her feet felt sour or every time her injury hurt. Ye Hanzhou nearly carried her the entire time so how could he have the thought to care for Lu Xueyan.Lu Xueyan was also a woman so how could she not see that Ruan Jiaojiao had done this on purpose? Yet, Ye Hanzhou ate her act up and even felt incessantly distressed. She dug her nails into her palms, itching to tear off this woman\u2019s pretentiously pitiful mask.She was only a little bit prettier than her but behind her face was a vicious heart. Those snake-like aunts of hers also relied on their beauty to trample over her mother under their feet.Lu Xueyan looked at Ye Hanzhou who had given up on keeping up boundaries between man and woman and simply carried Ruan Jiaojiao princess-style. He shook her off and without giving her a glance, he quickly strode over to Ruan Jiaojiao with big steps.At this moment, her jealousy, envy, as well as the hatred she had for her aunts had merged and balled up into a feeling of hostility towards Ruan Jiaojiao.She must ruthlessly tear off that woman\u2019s pretentious face!!Lu Xueyan glared at Ruan Jiaojiao, never expecting that the opportunity would present itself so soon.She had actually discovered that she was secretly colluding with the demonic sect!This woman was actually a witch of the demonic sect!Lu Xueyan grew extremely excited that she nearly couldn\u2019t contain herself!! But of course, as the female lead, she managed to calm herself down. She came up with a plan to tear off Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s mask in front of everyone and expose her scheme!The system couldn\u2019t understand why Ruan Jiaojiao deliberately revealed her identity to the female lead.Who would dig a pit for themselves? Did she dislike living too comfortably?\u201cEven if I don\u2019t do it myself, you were eventually going to dig a pit for me anyway.\u201dAccording to the system\u2019s wretched character, Ruan Jiaojiao deeply believed this to be the case.Moreover, she had already seen the power of the plot line so why not act first and reveal her identity?While the female lead secretly busied herself arranging matters, Ruan Jiaojiao also didn\u2019t slack off.Once she had recovered and was able to jump and kick around, another thought began to come alive in her head.Inside the room.Ruan Jiaojiao gently undid the ribbon of her skirt, allowing her attire to fall down to her waist, her upper body revealing only a dudou as she laid languidly on the bed.Ye Hanzhou held the medicine bottle and skillfully dug out a bit of ointment, smearing it on the scar left by the dart on her body.The girl\u2019s originally white and flawless back was now tainted by a faint brown scar. Even if Ye Hanzhou had already gotten used to seeing it, he still couldn\u2019t help but feel guilty.\u201cJiaojiao, I swear I will find the best physician to remove your scar.\u201dRuan Jiaojiao turned around and looked at Ye Hanzhou.\u201cWhy? Does Brother Ye think me revolting now?\u201dYe Hanzhou didn\u2019t think his words would be misunderstood and quickly gave an explanation.\u201cNo. I would never think that of you. I only feel distressed, very distressed.\u201dAs he said this, Ye Hanzhou pulled Ruan Jiaojiao into his arms.\u201cJiaojiao. No matter what Jiaojiao looks like, I will always like it.\u201dOh my! The male lead\u2019s words of love sure are endearing.Ruan Jiaojiao placed her fingers on Ye Hanzhou\u2019s lapels and raised her eyes, looking into his outstanding appearance.Sigh. Even though the male lead was handsome, when one had looked at him too much, they would soon tire of it. She missed little brother Qi Shen quite a bit now.Towards the host\u2019s habits of looking in another pot instead of her own bowl, even having climbed into the male lead\u2019s bed, and recalling his disappointing techniques, the system did not even think it odd anymore.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Though I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s for this series since it wasn\u2019t indicated, since I haven\u2019t gotten any ko-fi for this series, I\u2019m just going to pretend they supported bpetit haha. This chapter is dedicated to that ko-fi donator! Thanks for the support~The young girl\u2019s clothes were half undone, her eyes misty with autumn water, her embrace warm and soft. The hero always became a prisoner of love and Ye Hanzhou was no exception, his feelings surging within him like a tide.Besides, the two people had already experienced spring, the memory of their previous entanglement still existed in their memories and at times, in the middle of the night, he couldn\u2019t help but recall the taste of that night over and over again.At this moment, sensing the satiny, smooth hand, Ye Hanzhou\u2019s gaze fell on the thin dudou strap tied around Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s back and his breath hitched.Ruan Jiaojiao stuck close to Ye Hanzhou\u2019s body so she could naturally feel his every response. A naughty impulse struck her and she started to rub against him, blinking her pure and guileless eyes, however, she reached out a hand to cover the erect tent in between Ye Hanzhou\u2019s legs.\u201cBrother Ye, this part of yours..\u2019Ye Hanzhou still hadn\u2019t reacted when she quickly gripped his bulge separated by a piece of cloth and even mischievously rubbed it, feeling his breathing turn quick, his body turning more taut.\u201cThis root of yours hurt me so much to the point it even made me bleed\u2026\u201d She pouted and complained cutely.\u201cBrother Ye\u2026This time, you can\u2019t be so forceful\u2026you have to treat me gentler, ok?\u201dYe Hanzhou felt incomparably embarrassed and guilty by Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s accusation but the instant he heard her last sentence, he simply couldn\u2019t believe his ears and a wave of ecstasy quickly arose.Was she\u2026Ruan Jiaojiao sat up from the bed, revealing a crafty cat-like smile. She narrowed her eyes, her gaze fixated at Ye Hanzhou. Her lotus white arm reached out behind her and pulled gently, undoing that thin ribbon, causing her whole dudou to fall off.An explosion set off in his head and Ye Hanzhou could only feel his mind turning blank. The girl\u2019s snow like figure before him, blinded his eyes as she slid close to him like a snake.Ruan Jiaojiao threw herself into his arms, enveloping him in her sweet and fragrant scent. Ye Hanzhou\u2019s view turned blurry and the desire to discipline this little minx arose.This little enchantress!Ye Hanzhou acted faster than his thoughts that by the time he recovered his senses, he had already pressed Ruan Jiaojiao on the bed.Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s pink supple lips were parted slightly. Ye Hanzhou lowered his handsome face and captured her soft lips. His tongue invaded her entrance, strongly stirring around the insides of her oral cavity, relishing in the sweet and delectable taste of her fluids.Ruan Jiaojiao could feel him reaching the depths of her throat. This bastard was so crude she was about to start tearing up. Her soft body was pressed down underneath him and Ye Hanzhou\u2019s body was like a large beast caging her petite figure, the man\u2019s embrace no different to an iron bastion, crushing her.As though Ruan Jiaojiao misty eyes were a catalyst, Ye Hanzhou\u2019s beastly nature had started to boil.When man was driven by desire, it was as if he was able to learn without having to be guided. Even the knight-errants of the Jianghu were like this.His warm hand travelled down his slender waist and the sensation elicited a shiver out of Ruan Jiaojiao. When his finger pressed against her pearl, another quiver arose from her body and like the stormy rain falling down on a delicate flower, her tender and soft body started to shake and shudder in the gale.Ye Hanzhou\u2019s captivating look was reflected in Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s eyes, slowly growing bigger. The chilly air he emanated wrapped around her. He rubbed her dainty and soft mound with one hand while his other hand loitered around between the honey valley of her legs, the callused fingers wantonly rubbing the girl\u2019s sensitive zone.After her skirt and her inner clothing were peeled off, the two naked bodies met, his wheat colored skin formed a stark contrast against her snow white skin when the two bodies entangled together.\u201cJiaojiao\u2026\u201d\u201cMm\u2026\u201d Ruan Jiaojiao hummed.Ye Hanzhou\u2019s thick and sturdy length pressed against her tender pink seams. Even when he was on the verge of losing control, he tried his best to restrain himself from ramming his length into her in one motion and called out her name lowly. His gloomy eyes were locked onto the young girl beneath him, and like a restless wild beast, he made a proclamation before he started his meal.Ruan Jiaojiao was feeling inexplicably expectant. Ever since she had arrived in this world in the body of a child, even though she had cultivated deep feelings with Qi Shen who was a fresh little meat back then, by sharing the same bed, \u00a0for the sake of preserving her remaining integrity and scruples, she could only see and touch him but not eat.Even though she had already rolled in the sheets with Ye Hanzhou during the time she had been struck with the effects of a drug, the pain of losing her first time overwhelmed any tinge of pleasure it was supposed to have.At last\u2026now that the fleshy meat had delivered itself to her lips, she nearly felt herself break into tears from excitement.\u201cBrother Ye..\u201dShe bit her lip pretending to be shy, mewling out his name expectantly, appearing aggrieved yet urgent.Just when he was about to insert his rod into her flower seams, a clear and pleasant voice like oriole rang from outside the door.\u201cLady Ruan, do you know where Brother Ye is?\u201dF**k!Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s body stiffened. Didn\u2019t the female lead know that the consequences for disturbing other people\u2019s \u201chappy time\u201d was to get struck by lightning!!Ye Hanzhou\u2019s eyes darkened, his mood evidently turning sour.Outside the door, Lu Xuyan feigned a light and relaxed tone when in reality, her hand was clenched into a fist and her expression looked ugly.She knew that Ye Hanzhou was inside and if both man and woman were all alone in one room with the other being an enchantress of the demonic sect, she was worried that Ye Hanzhou would be deceived and led astray by her beauty, falling deeper and deeper into love.\u201cLady Ruan! Lady Ruan!! Are you there?!\u201dSeeing that nobody responded from within the room, Lu Xueyan grew more panicked, her calls becoming more urgent.Motherf**ker, why is she screaming so loudly? The male lead is about to turn impotent from your screams, don\u2019t you know!!How dare you disturb this granny\u2019s happy time!!While Ye Hanzhou was still in a dilemma and looked as if he was about to retract his member, Ruan Jiaojiao raised her white lotus arms and wrapped them tightly around the man\u2019s firm arms, leaning over to give his thin lips a kiss. She then lifted her butt upwards and in an instant, her sopping wet cave swallowed half of his length.\u201cMmm\u2026so big..\u201d Ruan Jiaojiao immediately turned stiff from the pain of being stretched out.However, determined to do this until the end, she pushed Ye Hanzhou who was stunned by her bold move down and caught off guard, Ye Hanzhou was flipped over to the bed and pressed down beneath her.With a bout of strength, Ruan Jiaojiao straddled him and dropped her slender waist down, taking in his thick little brother. She got stuck halfway and started to move up and down, squeezing out a lot of liquid to lubricate herself before finally managing to eat the whole of him in.Her hole was tight and narrow but it greedily tried to eat his whole thing. Ruan Jiaojiao pushed through the pain and sat down. A layer of thin sweat had also started to surface on her skin due to her fear of pain and now that she had achieved her goal, her taut nerves had finally come loose and a sigh naturally escaped her lips.Ye Hanzhou couldn\u2019t help but smile, amused by her martyr-like attitude when at this moment, the door was suddenly pushed open.Hearing the noises inside the room, in a moment of panic, Lu Xueyan opened the doors and didn\u2019t expect to encounter this scene.Her eyes grew wide seeing two people\u2019s bodies entangled without an inch of distance in disbelief. Moreover, it was actually Ruan Jiaojiao who was on top, riding on Ye Hanzhou.Even though the bed curtains had blocked a partial view of thie er*tic scene, the two people\u2019s intimate parts were evidently joined together.It was apparent that she had disrupted the two people\u2019s sensual affair!!Shameless enchantress!!Lu Xueyan nearly blurted out. Fortunately, she had merely spat these words in her heart but her face had turned scarlet red from shame.Truthfully, Ye Hanzhou had reacted very quickly. The moment Lu Xueyan pushed the door open, he had completely let down the curtains of the bed as well as covered their joined bodies with the quilt.Having never thought that Lu Xueyan would actually break in, Ye Hanzhou\u2019s handsome face was now as frosty as ice, his gaze cold and gloomy.\u201cI-\u2026I\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201dLu Xueyan\u2019s cheeks turned hot, unable to help but recall Ye Hanzhou\u2019s wheat color skin and erotic figure, his strong testosterones making her heart beat wildly.Separated by just the bed curtains, it was as if they were in two different worlds.One side was Lu Xueyan while the other was Ruan Jiaojiao and Ye Hanzhou in each other\u2019s embrace.Ruan Jiaojiao was still lying on top of Ye Hanzhou, her finger caressing Ye Hanzhou\u2019s seemingly dark face. She coolly said to Lu Xueyan.\u201cLady Lu, I didn\u2019t think that the brilliant and reputed Free Manor would educate their children to casually intrude in their guest\u2019s room whenever they feel like it.\u201dThe mockery in her words provoked Lu Xueyan\u2019s shame to grow deeper, making her grit her teeth.This shameless slut! No wonder she was a member of the demonic shameless, She was impudent!She must have used her beauty to seduce Brother Ye. She would never allow this enchantress to continue deceiving Brother Ye!!In any case, Lu Xueyan was still the female lead so how could she be easily deterred by just a few words. She quickly put on a panicked expression and hurriedly apologized, her attitude considerably humble, making the other person hesitate being overbearing.However, how could Ruan Jiaojiao have the time to listen to her ramble nonstop?\u201cLady Lu, how long are you going to stay there? You\u2019ve already seen that Brother Ye is currently here with me and we\u2019re very preoccupied right now. Could you please leave?\u201dLu Xueyan was taken aback, not expecting that Ruan Jiaojiao would be so thick-faced to this degree.At this time, the quiet Ye Hanzhou also finally spoke up.\u201cLady Ruan, please leave.\u201dWith a thud sound, the door was shut.Ruan Jiaojiao drew the bed curtains open and after Ye Hanzhou had spoken up, Lu Xueyan silently left. As expected of the patient female lead.However, at the same time, this could only mean that she was not easy to deal with, however, having been caught riding the male lead in front of the female lead, Ruan Jiaojiao really found it too f**king exciting!T/N: It seems that our female lead has an exhibitionist k*nk eh?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Her pearly whites bit through a purplish red grape, the sour and sweet juice instantly pervading her mouth, making her narrow her eyes in pleasure.Ye Hanzhou watched her languid and lovable appearance, her every movement unintentionally revealing a tinge of seductiveness, making him feel somewhat itchy and he stopped practicing his sword, walking towards her. He pinched her nose, the sharp look in his eyes immediately converging, turning into a pampering and gentle look.Ruan Jiaojiao pulled his big palm, her small, delicate hands stroking Ye Hanzhou\u2019s callused and thick palm. Ye Hanzhou\u2019s throat tightened, his thoughts running amok until Ruan Jiaojiao parted her red little lips and spat out the purplish grape skin and skin onto it, winking at him mischievously and even feeling a bit proud upon carrying out this prank.Faced with her sparkling eyes, how could Swordsman Ye muster the slightest annoyance? He pinched her dainty chin and covered her ruddy lips with his thin lips. Her mouth still carried the sweet and sour tastes of grapes, tasting so delectable that Ye Hanzhou couldn\u2019t help but desire to swallow her into his stomach.Such a sweet scene was being looked on by a pair of cold and pitch black eyes. Sensing this, Ruan Jiaojiao couldn\u2019t help but shiver.Qi Shen?!Aiya, her cute little darling had finally come. She was about to be bored to death, entangling with the male lead.Thinking that she could finally stop seeing the male lead, Ruan Jiaojiao felt inconceivably excited.Perhaps because he was wary of Ye Hanzhou\u2019s strength, or because they were at the Free Manor, the enemy\u2019s territory, it wouldn\u2019t do Qi Shen any good to carelessly make a move and inadvertently alert the enemy, hence, he restrained his emotions reasonably.In the dead of the night, when all the people of the manor were asleep, he finally revealed himself from the dark.Confronting a cold-faced and gloomy Qi Shen, upon seeing him come out, Ruan Jiaojiao immediately rushed over excitedly, wrapping her arms around Qi Shen\u2019s waist, burying her pretty face in his chest. With a longing and affectionate tone, she complained grievously.\u201cBrother Qi, why did you only come out now. I nearly thought I wouldn\u2019t be able to see you anymore\u2026wuuuwuuuwuu\u2026\u201d Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s voice was brimming with sadness and complaint. After saying these words, she immediately burst into tears.Life was like a play, it all depended on one\u2019s acting skills.Ruan Jiaojiao mixed truths and lies in her words as she narrated how Ye Hanzhou threateningly captured her away from the demonic sect with teary eyes, how she was bullied by him on their journey and just as she was about to escape, she was struck by poison and narrowly escaped death. In the end, it was only after submitting herself to Ye Hanzhou and thinking of all ways to curry favor with him was she able to survive by the skin of her teeth.Did Qi Shen believe her?Ruan Jiaojiao didn\u2019t know, but it felt as though his arm was going to snap her slender waist into two.\u201cJiaojiao, do you know how I managed to find you?\u201d Qi Shen\u2019s tone sounded slightly vague.\u201cEnvoy Bai.\u201dQi Shen uttered.Afterwards, Ruan Jiaojiao saw a black-clothed Bai Jingyan leap down from the ceiling beams and she cursed internally.Fuck!Now that her white lotus act was exposed, forgetting that Qi Shen was the person she had shared a bed with for many years, how could he believe her weak character act and statement when compared with Bai Jingyan\u2019s confession?Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s petite body quivered. Should she pretend to faint right now?\u201cBrother Qi! I was wrong!!\u201dRuan Jiaojiao buried her face in Qi Shen\u2019s arms, immediately carrying out another tactic.\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201dThis time, she did not play any dirty tricks, honestly narrating the events that transpired from when she fled from Qi Zhanfeng\u2019s evil clutches and coincidentally running into Ye Hanzhou, to how she had been kidnapped by a pervert and drugged, thereby losing her virginity to Ye Hanzhou.\u201cThe reason why I lied to you was so that you wouldn\u2019t come into conflict with your father the sect leader, also\u2026 due to an unexpected turn of events, I\u2019ve already done the deed with that man surnamed Ye so I\u2026I didn\u2019t want you to be sad.\u201d\u201cSo\u2026did you fall in love with him\u2026.Jiaojiao?\u201d Qi Shen\u2019s voice shook a little, his figure quivering slightly as well.Ruan Jiaojiao was a little hesitant. She bit her lips and raised her eyes towards Qi Shen, unwillingness streaking across her heart.She opened her mouth and before she could even say a word, Qi Shen captured her lips.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She didn\u2019t resist him in the slightest and allowed him to ravage her lips.Ruan Jiaojiao thought to herself. This kind of love and hate act was really exciting and enjoyable.After an unknown amount of time had passed, Qi Shen let go of her and Ruan Jiaojiao looked up at him in a daze.She then suddenly felt the sky turn as Qi Shen carried her up from the bed princess-style and emanated an air that could overwhelm a person.With a tear, the crisp sound of silk ripping apart resounded in the air.Qi Shen had torn off Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s clothes.\u201cDone the deed? What does that matter\u2026I\u2019ve shared the same bed with you these many years, what else haven\u2019t we done aside from me putting it inside of you\u2026\u201dHot damn!He was too f**king aggressive\u2026..and too exciting\u2026.Ruan Jiaojiao turned weak. Qi Shen was like a starving beast who had burst out of his cage. The clothes she was wearing instantly turned into rags, her alluring body exposed to the air with nowhere to hide.Qi Shen simply didn\u2019t give her a chance to resist at all and dropped his waist, parting her legs and undoing his trousers, plunging his iron hard rod into her flower cave like a pestle. And now, he pounded her strongly with a strength like he was about to kill her.Ruan Jiaojiao: \u201c\u2026.\u201dShe sobbed, noiselessly crying as if she was bearing the pain.At this moment, it was better to be silent than make a sound. Big tears trickled down her face and the undulating Qi Shen on top of her froze up, as if the beast had gained humanity. However, he didn\u2019t pull out of her; instead, he slowed down his actions and eased his strength, thr*sting in and out of her firmly and frequently.As expected, men were all beasts! Now that they had finally gotten a taste of meat, why would they spit it out?Ruan Jiaojiao quickly gave up any hope for resistance and turned her head to the side, meeting Bai Jingyan\u2019s dark eyes.Motherf**ker!How could she have forgotten him! Envoy Bai was watching her do the deed again!!Darn it!!Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s face was really lost in front of the b*stard Bai Jingyan.\u201cE-\u2026Envoy Bai\u2026\u201dRuan Jiaojiao\u2019s exclaim drew Qi Shen\u2019s attention and he quickly shot a sharp glare at Bai Jingyan while pulling a quilt to cover themselves up. However, the figures beneath the quilt still continued to shake, evidently showing he was busy.\u201cGet out!\u201d Qi Shen scolded Bai Jingyan.The situation with the three of them, Qi Shen, Ruan Jiaojiao and Bai Jingyan, was quite calm, mainly due to the atmosphere they were brought up in in the demonic sect.Take Qi Shen\u2019s father, Qi Zhanfeng, for instance, he often gave orders to his subordinates during s*x. When that old pervert was in high spirits, he would pull in several women and engage in debauchery, displayed right in front of everyone. Sometimes, when he felt like it, he would even exchange women with his subordinates.Of course, Qi Shen had never participated in that kind of scene and also prevented Ruan Jiaojiao from ever seeing it happen.When Ruan Jiaojiao slipped past his radar to peep at them out of curiosity, she was even captured and dragged back by him expressionlessly.However, Ruan Jiaojiao didn\u2019t think that her first time with Qi Shen would also have a bystander observing them.Bai Jingyan did not move, calmly remaining in place as if the two people\u2019s impatience couldn\u2019t be more apparent.\u201cMaster, I wish to remind you not to forget about official matters.\u201dOfficial matters? What matters?Ruan Jiaojiao looked at QI Shen suspiciously as he continued thrusting his rod deeply into her hole. Her cave couldn\u2019t help but tighten, making Qi Shen\u2019s eyes turn dark and he bent his waist to ram her even more intensely as though he was trying to punish her for almost making him release.As the saying went, \u201cquarrels happen at the head of the bed and compromise at the end of it\u201d, a single f**k solved a thousand worries.The atmosphere around the two people immediately reverted back to the original. With a grasp of his weakness, Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s little hand pulled on Qi Shen\u2019s clothes.Motherf**ker!This b*stard ripped all of this granny\u2019s clothes off while he only revealed his d**k! This was too unfair!!\u201cJiaojiao, don\u2019t mess around..\u201dRuan Jiaojioa\u2019s wandering hands elicited an itchy sensation that Qi Shen couldn\u2019t help but grab hold of them yet she relentlessly clamped down on him again.The two people\u2019s movements under the quilt weren\u2019t reserved, giving rise to ripples in Bai Jingyan\u2019s mysterious and profound gaze.As though he had sensed something, Qi Shen shot Bai Jingyan a cold glare and for a moment, electricity sparked between the two men.God d**nit!The two people exchanged glances in front of her and one of them was even laying with her under the quilt, his member going in and out of her hole.Were they treating her like she was dead?!Ruan Jiaojiao once again turned him over and replaced him on top. With a force of her slender waist and her legs spread apart, she changed positions with Qi Shen under the quilt.This was not the first time she had acted so willfully. Qi Shen let her do as she wished but the view he saw today was different from the usual. As such, Qi Shen helplessly stretched out his arms, trying to restrain her.\u201cJiaojiao, don\u2019t mess around..\u201dMotherf**ker, look who\u2019s speaking. He didn\u2019t even allow her to explain and went straight to ripping her clothes off and plunging it in. He didn\u2019t even care that Bai Jingyan was standing right there and now he was treating her as the troublemaking one?Ruan Jiaojiao stared at the corner of her eyes and saw Bai Jingyan standing like a pillar. She straightened her back covered with the quilt, not caring whether she would be fully exposed. She raised her lips slightly with a twinkle in her eye, appearing extremely seductive.\u201cBrother Bai, what official matters were you talking about?\u201d\u201cKilling Lu Yuanpeng.\u201d Bai Jingyan didn\u2019t keep her on tenterhooks, answering her question.Ruan Jiaojiao was stunned. The plot had shifted back to the original setting.The original owner married Lu Yuanpeng and became his concubine in order to find an opportunity to kill the current leader of the Martial Arts Alliance. Without a head, the upright sect would fall into chaos and that would be the day the demonic sect would wreak havoc.Qi Shen looked at the alluring girl pressing down on him and felt unhappy that she was holding a conversation alone with Bai Jingyan. As such, he exerted strength with his waist, pushing it up so that his rod pierced the deepest part of Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s cave, making her petite body quiver. An inexplicable sour feeling quickly assailed her, eliciting a mewl from her lips. As if a drop of oil landed in a scorching hot pan, a sizzling sound rang forth, turning the atmosphere steamy.Seeing Ruan Jiaojiao with flushed cheeks and misty eyes, her skin fair and tender, Qi Shen held her waist, feeling the soft satiny sensation. With a flick of his fingers, the bed curtains fell down, separating the bed from the room and forming two different spaces.Qi Shen instantly took control again, the bed once again rocking madly, producing creaking sounds. At times, one could hear the man\u2019s heavy breathing mixed with the girl\u2019s suppressed yet spilled alluring m*ans.Bai Jingyan\u2019s eyes grew darker and though he hadn\u2019t budged at all, it was as if he was going to become one with the darkness outside the room.Ruan Jiaojiao was simply unable to divide her attention. It was as if Qi Shen was struck with the effects of aphr*disiac, pressing her down and hating that he couldn\u2019t do her to the point of breaking her apart.Fortunately, she already experienced the deed once and this body\u2019s sensitivity was incredible. Once she endured the initial pain, her honeypot started to secrete ample liquid, and she quickly started feeling the pleasure.The two people immersed themselves in the pleasure of coupling and while Qi Shen was enjoying this incomparably sweet taste, he couldn\u2019t help but think that she had already done this with some other guy and might\u2019ve even been taught how to do this which allowed him to smoothly have coitus with her, and an unspeakable acidity and pain arose in his heart.He was going to kill the man who tainted her!A gloomy and cold air flashed past Qi Shen\u2019s dark eyes and Ruan Jiaojiao could detect this, silently lighting a candle for Ye Hanzhou internally. Then, she closed her eyes and tightly embraced the man\u2019s powerful body, allowing him to pound her continuously until she eventually climbed the peak of bliss.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Do you feel a little bit better?\u201dRuan Jiaojiao had been tortured by Qi Shen the whole night so she wasn\u2019t able to get any sleep. When Ye Hanzhou came to look for her this morning, she used the excuse of feeling unwell to shoo him away.Seeing Ye Hanzhou treat the enchantress so considerately, even though Lu Xueyan had already formulated a plan, her expression turned ugly.\u201cLady Ruan, Brother Ye said that you were feeling unwell, I specially asked the kitchen to stew some soup that would be of aid to your health. Quickly drink it while it\u2019s still hot.\u201dLu Xueyan smiled like a flower, giving her a goblet of soup.Ruan Jiaojiao really didn\u2019t dare drink the soup the female lead had prepared for her.\u201cThank you Lady Lu for your kind intentions. However, I don\u2019t have any appetite right now, I wouldn\u2019t be able to drink it.\u201dRuan Jiaojiao was too lazy to keep up this fake sisterly act with the female lead. She leaned in Ye Hanzhou\u2019s arms weakly, putting on an extremely delicate appearance. The dark circles under her pretty eyes made her countenance look haggard, completely without the bright luster she usually had.Ye Hanzhou\u2019s heart tightened. He tightened his arms around her as if afraid that the wind would blow her away.\u201cIf you\u2019re not feeling well, don\u2019t force yourself. Return to your room and lie down.\u201dRuan Jiaojiao thought to herself. She also didn\u2019t want to come out in the first place when her bones felt like they were about to fall apart from exhaustion but that shitty little system kept excitedly chanting in her ears that she was about to get cheated on.Seeing the two people flirt openly in front of her, Lu Xueyan was completely ignored, making her unable to hold the smile on her face no matter how thick her face was. And so, she quickly found an excuse and left.Once she left, Ruan Jiaojiao ruthlessly pinched Ye Hanzhou\u2019s hand, however, his robust arm was as tough as steel. Her pinch didn\u2019t feel like anything to him at all. Because of this, her face twisted in anger and she viciously stomped Ye Hanzhou\u2019s leg, threatening him.\u201cI don\u2019t like her! You\u2019re not allowed to be alone with her. If I catch this sight again next time, I\u2019m going to return to the demonic sect and I won\u2019t care about you aymore!!\u201dYe Hanzhou was taken aback. Even if he was a dense person, he still knew she was angry.The girl was jealous. Originally, he felt somewhat happy but hearing her say that she was going to return to the demonic sect, a restless and gloomy feeling arose in his heart.Ye Hanzhou immediately pulled Ruan Jiaojiao into his embrace, hugging her tight with such crushing force as if he hated that he couldn\u2019t meld the girl into his bones.\u201cJiaojiao, no matter how willful you are, no matter what you want me to do, never say that you\u2019re returning to the demonic sect. You\u2019re already my person. If you leave me, I\u2019m going to the demonic sect to find you and even if it means having to go through fire and water, I\u2019ll take you back and chain you by my side with nowhere else to go.\u201dRuan Jiaojiao heard these words and felt befuddled as to why it seemed like the male lead was showing signs of blackening. She couldn\u2019t help but feel a little afraid but also inexplicably felt expectant.The words Ruan Jiaojiao said kept resurfacing in Ye Hanzhou\u2019s heart. He felt as if something had happened and as a man himself, he also noticed the lecherous gaze Head Lu directed at Ruan Jiaojiao.Lu Yuanpeng originally concealed it very well but upon hearing his daughter Lu Xueyan\u2019s report, Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s identity was uncovered.That girl previously held the identity of Ye Hanzhou\u2019s friend so he naturally viewed her as a distinguished guest, but now that he learnt she was from the demonic sect, Lu Yuanpeng immediately had thoughts of playing with her obscenely and capturing her as bait for the demonic sect.Lu Xueyan had her own big plans for Ruan Jiaojiao but her lecherous father Lu Yuanpeng had other plans of his own.Lu Yuanpeng naturally thought that Ye Hanzhou didn\u2019t know of Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s identity, assuming without any doubt that he had been tricked by the woman. Otherwise, how else could Swordsman Ye who was known for walking the Jianghu alone, associate with someone from the demonic sect?And so, he arranged a banquet to specially entertain the two people and quietly slipped something in the drinks.When Ye Hanzhou noticed something amiss in his drink, he pretended to faint and saw Lu Yuanpeng reach out to Ruan Jiaojiao impatiently, anger bubbled within him as he itched to cut his hand off.Upon receiving the news, Lu Xueyan hurried over and saw this scene.\u201cFather!\u201dShe watched incredulously as her father prepared to take off with the girl with a smile on his face.Lu Yuanpeng didn\u2019t expect Lu Xueyan to come across this scene but upon thinking that she was his own daughter, he no longer cared less.\u201cYou came at the right time. Take responsibility for looking after Ye Hanzhou while I take this enchantress away and thoroughly interrogate her. When Ye Hanzhou awakes, reveal this girl\u2019s identity to her.Lu Xueyan had been patient these days, waiting to carry out her scheme but she didn\u2019t expect that her efforts would be all for naught.. She wanted to expose the girl\u2019s true face to everyone, for her to receive the martial arts circle\u2019s revile and lashing but she didn\u2019t think that her father would ruin her plans. However, if she hadn\u2019t told this matter to Lu Yuanpeng in the beginning, she wouldn\u2019t have been able to achieve it with her current strength.Lu Xueyan wanted to question Lu Yuanepng whether he was enchanted by the girl\u2019s beauty, deliberately ruining her plans because of his selfish intentions.However, she didn\u2019t dare and she couldn\u2019t.Inside the Free Manor, nobody dared oppose Lu Yuanpeng, even if it was his own daughter.If she got on his bad side, she wouldn\u2019t only be ignored, it could even implicate her mother and their days would only get harder.Lu Xueyan was already used to suffering in silence. As such, she swallowed all her doubts and anger, obediently heeding his commands.\u201cYes, Father.\u201dShe looked to where Ye Hanzhou had fainted and her heart suddenly skipped a beat. Wasn\u2019t it better for her father to take that enchantress away? Because at the very least, now, Ye Hanzhou wouldn\u2019t have to dance in the palm of her hand, using those gentle doting eyes to look at her, making her so jealous that her heart bubbled with jealousy, hating that she couldn\u2019t replace her instead.Even though this matter might seem malicious, she believed it would allow Ye Hanzhou to put a stop to his feelings towards this demonic enchantress who had already lost her purity.Moreover, she was only listening to her father\u2019s commands. She didn\u2019t do anything wrong. In fact, she was even helping Ye Hanzhou by exposing the enchantress\u2019s true identity.Lu Xueyan quickly pulled herself together and expectantly leaned close to Ye Hanzhou to take care of him when the originally unconscious man suddenly leapt up, pressing a sharp dagger against her neck.\u201cHead Lu, return Jiaojiao back to me!\u201dYe Hanzhou\u2019s pupils were like cold stars, his gaze fixated at Lu Yuanpeng.For a moment, the atmosphere was tense.Lu Yuanpeng didn\u2019t expect that Ye Hanzhou would pretend to have fainted. And since he was the head of the martial arts alliance, having accumulated many experiences, he quickly managed to calm himself down and explained the reason why he did such a thing.\u201cVirtuous brother Ye, I was worried that you would be led astray by this demonic enchantress so I could only use such a method first and take her away for interrogation.\u201dYe Hanzhou sneered, showing no intentions of hearing him quibble.\u201cI was the one who brought her in. Please return her to me, Head Lu.\u201dAs he spoke, he pressed his sword even harder, causing blood to start seeping from the gash created on Lu Xueyan\u2019s neck.\u201cBrother Ye\u2026you\u2026that woman is from the demonic sect. She\u2019s been lying to you!\u201dGrievance and unwillingness welled up in Lu Xueyan\u2019s heart. She couldn\u2019t understand why even after learning of that woman\u2019s identity, he still maintained the same attitude, even taking the initiative to harm her!Ye Hanzhou simply didn\u2019t pay attention to her, his gaze revealing ruthlessness.\u201cGive her back to me!\u201dNow that things had come to this point, Lu Yuanpeng could no longer pretend to be a fool. He understood that Ye Hanzhou had already learnt of this girl\u2019s identity early on and had probably already lost his heart and soul.\u201cVirtuous Brother Ye, are you trying to take the upright martial arts circle as your enemy by entangling with the people of the demonic sect?\u201dEven with this threat, Ye Hanzhou didn\u2019t seem the least bit afraid.\u201cSo what?\u201d He raised a brow, his expression indifferent.Lu Yuanpeng then recovered his senses. Ye Hanzhou didn\u2019t ally himself with the upright or the evil. His way of handling matters was always according to his own judgement and though he didn\u2019t commit evil, he wouldn\u2019t adhere too strictly to the rules of the Jianghu as well.His martial arts was powerful and even though the two had never exchanged blows, Lu Yuanpeng could sense that he was more powerful than him. That was why Lu Yuanpeng took the initiative to befriend him, even deliberately currying favor with him.But now, he had completely offended the other party.Everything was the fault of his daughter who didn\u2019t clarify the truth of the matter and merely made trouble.How could Lu Yuanpeng not see his own errs as well. He simply pinned the blame of this troublesome conflict onto Lu Xueyan in secret.T/N: Like father, like daughter. Both are terrible, just in different ways.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When the old fox Lu Yuanpeng saw that the odds were stacked against him, knowing he wasn\u2019t Ye Hanzhou\u2019s opponent, he obediently handed her back to Ye Hanzhou, making her feel at ease and soon truly falling asleep.Seeing her wake up, Ye Hanzhou then asked her to pack up her things and took her away from the Free Manor.How could Lu Yuanpeng let the tiger go back to the mountains? Even though he had a good relationship with Ye Hanzhou on the surface, Ye Hanzhou\u2019s existence was also a dangerous threat to his position as the head of the Martial Arts Alliance.And so that very night, he notified all the sects to hurry over, claiming that Ye Hanzhou had colluded with a member of the demonic cult and was conspiring a crime.Because of this, before Ruan Jiaojiao and Ye Hanzhou had even gotten far, they were surrounded by experts from every big sect.With a long sword in hand, Ye Hanzhou protected Ruan Jiaojiao in his arms and confronted the hundreds of people surrounding them.Ruan Jiaojiao secretly thought to herself that even if Ye Hanzhou had amazing abilities, with a burden like her at his side and the overwhelming number of people in the enemy camp, there was no way Ye Hanzhou would be able to win this battle.Thinking that he could finally extinguish the threat as well as obtain the beauty, Lu Yuanpeng couldn\u2019t suppress the excitement in his heart and commanded.\u201cKill Ye Hanzhou and capture the demonic enchantress!\u201dLu Yuanpeng unsheathed his sword first and charged towards Ye Hanzhou, sparring with him.For a moment, only the shadow of swords could be seen, sparks flying everywhere.Seeing Ye Hanzhou\u2019s heroic valor, one person going against many, Ruan Jiaojiao was deeply stunned by the scene of the martial arts world.Amazing!Ruan Jiaojiao was so excited, she couldn\u2019t imagine that she had slept with such a handsome guy before, even faintly feeling proud of herself.However, when Ye Hanzhou was struck by a concealed weapon at some point in time, his blood staining his green long robes, he still held Ruan Jiaojiao tightly in his arms and she could sense him trying his best to hold on. The people who besieged him became even more ruthless. The more the battle prolonged, the braver he fought. A thought suddenly popped into her mind.Holy shit! The male lead wouldn\u2019t be killed here right?!When Lu Yuanpeng saw Ye Hanzhou on the verge of collapsing, he felt secretly thrilled, emphasizing the next few words.\u201cDon\u2019t hurt the girl, capture her alive as a bargaining chip for the demonic sect!\u201dYe Hanzhou was injured but he had to protect Ruan Jiaojiao, They were surrounded by enemies on all sides and he sustained injuries on his stomach and back, a gash on his arm, fresh blood \u00a0flowing down his arm, reaching the back of his hand. Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s lotus colored dress was also dyed red, a bright red plum blossom blossoming.Ruan Jiaojiao finally couldn\u2019t hold herself back and quickly held Ye Hanzhou, using her petite frame to cover him and exclaiming.\u201cDon\u2019t attack us anymore! We surrender!!\u201dIf the fight went on, the male lead was really going to die!She also heard Lu Yuanpeng\u2019s command of capturing her alive so she wasn\u2019t afraid of those people harming her.As expected, after seeing her act, everyone stopped.Ye Hanzhou had gotten harmed because there were a number of those who had previously received his help, there were naturally those who took pity on him and only kept an eye on him.Whereas Ruan Jiaojiao was detained in a cell.Lu Yuanpeng hosted a banquet to entertain the guest and not too long after the banquet began, the slightly intoxicated head recalled the presence of the little beauty locked alone in her cell. Capriciousness took over him as he found an excuse to leave the banquet, impatiently hurrying to the dark cell.However, he never expected that Envoy Bai\u2019s sword would be the one to welcome him, the other person piercing a hole in him.Lu Yuanpeng originally happily thought that he was going to have a blissful time but the result was that he had been killed, dropping down to the ground, his blood spreading everywhere.The martial arts alliance head of the generation died ever so quietly.Ruan Jiaojiao was brought out of the cell by Qi Shen. At this moment, the upright sects had long been unaware of the demonic sect\u2019s forces infiltrating the manor. They indulged in merrymaking, celebrating with songs and dancing. Little did they know they had drunk the poison Luo Yunlou slipped into their drinks but by the time everyone noticed it, it was already too late.Ruan Jiaojiao wanted to go find Ye Hanzhou but before she could even open her mouth, as if knowing her thoughts, Qi Shen\u2019s gaze was cold as he calmly said.\u201cIf you want me to spare his life then forget his existence.\u201dAnd so, she could only swallow her words back and did as he commanded.How could Qi Shen really let Ye Hanzhou live? Not long after they left, he set the manor in flames. Even though some were fortunate enough to escape, the majority of the upright sects were caught in the trap, the casualties numbering aplenty.At this night, a thick and heavy stroke streaked inevitably across the future of the Jianghu power balance.\u2026.A month later.The sect leader Qin Zhanfeng suddenly passed away and the young leader Qi Shen succeeded him.Moreover, a lot of the people from the heroic sect died in the Free Manor\u2019s gathering. With this, the demonic sect\u2019s strength skyrocketed, becoming invincible, the wind turning to their favor.The newly elected head of the martial arts circle quickly rectified the messy situation in haste.During the calamity that struck Free Manor, Ye Hanzhou was rescued by Lu Xueyan but after having lost so much blood, he fainted. \u00a0By the time he woke up, Ruan Jiaojiao had already gone back to the demonic sect.Everything seemed like a conspiracy.Ruan Jiaojiao approached him, used her beauty to seduce him, leading him to bring her to the Free Manor, helping the demonic sect infiltrate, and with forces cooperating inside and outside, it led to today\u2019s aftermath.Ye Hanzhou felt depressed. Lu Xueyan took care of him meticulously, trying to move his heart with her tenderness but once Ye Hanzhou\u2019s condition had improved, the moment he could get off the bed, he left behind a notice and disappeared.The note contained words that expressed his gratitude towards her and if they had any fate in the future, he would surely repay her.Lu Xueyan was so angry she could spit out blood. He had been deceived and betrayed by that woman but he still couldn\u2019t forget her. She knew that he had definitely gone to the demonic sect to find that girl so she also headed to the direction of the demonic sect.When the system told Ruan Jiaojiao that both the male and female lead were heading towards the demonic sect, she had already been idling in the town of Xuejia for several days.That\u2019s right!Up until now, she hadn\u2019t made a single progress in her mission so now she needed to resume the important task of finding her parents.However, despite much time passing, after walking everywhere in town, trying to find traces of the original owner\u2019s birth, she didn\u2019t find anything.Ruan Jiaojiao sat inside a teahouse, peeling peanuts out of boredom. She was at her wits\u2019 end until the subordinates Qi Shen sent over to protect her, notified her that the leader was urging for her to return, even giving her an ultimatum.If she didn\u2019t find anything by tomorrow, she must return.Ptoo Ptoo Ptoo, why was he trying to hurry her for!Ruan Jiajiao thought to herself, the wolfdog she raised was now so insufferable. Upon becoming the leader of the sect, he was now flaunting his power.Just as she was harboring a lot of thoughts, another person sat beside her.Ruan Jiaojiao raised her eyes and looked at the person, feeling a little surprised.Luo Yunlou?\u201cBrother Luo, why are you here?\u201d Ruan Jiaojiao put on a flattering smile but on the inside, her heart dropped down.If he wasn\u2019t researching those poisons in the sect, why would he come here?\u201cI\u2019m here to collect a debt.\u201d The moment Luo Yunlou sat down, he became quite eye-catching.In order not to attract other people\u2019s attention, Ruan Jiaojiao disguised herself as a man and even put on a cap. She also smeared her pretty face grey, appearing like an ordinary-looking youth.When Luo Yunlou sat down, with white clothing, face as gentle as jade, his appearance handsome, he looked like an elegant noble son from the world of mortals, attracting several women inside the teahouse to look over, staring at him with smitten eyes.Ruan Jiaojiao lifted her cup up to take a sip. This guy was always good at putting up airs when in fact, he had a belly full of black water.As long as anyone in the sect carelessly offended him, they would inexplicably feel unwell, rolling around in pain. Furthermore, they would itch until they broke their skin and couldn\u2019t even plead for death, in the end, they would resort to taking a knife and stabbing themselves to death to end their misery.\u201cDebt? Who owes you?\u201d Ruan Jiaojiao wore a curious expression, acting in accord with him but alarms rang in her heart, a sense of foreboding arising.\u201cDidn\u2019t you steal something from me?\u201dLuo Yunlou raised the teapot, pouring tea for her and speaking in an unruffled tone.Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s legs suddenly turned soft. She had always evaded Luo Yunlou in the demonic sect and was afraid of getting on his bad side. Thinking of the demented ways he sought revenge, she felt her scalp turn numb.And back at that time, she had dared to steal his stuff because she wanted to leave the demonic sect and never come back again.T/N: Even though Luo Yunlou was mentioned in passing in the first part of the series, I feel like at this point author is just adding more male lead because\u2026..the more the merrier? Living up to the reverse harem genre I guess.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The girl\u2019s slender hands were soft and white, a stark contrast to her deliberately grey-smeared face, however, her eyes were bright and lustrous as though they could pierce through someone\u2019s heart, even appearing a bit charming, adding to her appeal.As though he had laid eyes on something filthy, he shifted his face away from hers as if he had been sullied.\u201cWhat kind of ghastly look were you trying to go for with that appearance?\u201dLuo Yunlou was a little mysophobic, hence, his fondness for wearing white clothes. If it weren\u2019t because Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s hand looked clean enough, he would\u2019ve kicked her down the stairs just for touching his clothes.However, this girl had always been tactful and had never offended him. She also had a pleasing smile so Luo Yunlou had a higher tolerance for her than anybody else.Ruan Jiaojiao said with a smile.\u201cBrother Luo, you probably don\u2019t know this but I\u2019m very pretty. It\u2019s very hard to come across someone who\u2019s as naturally pretty as I am and if I reveal my appearance, I fear I would only attract unwanted trouble.\u201dLuo Yunlou did not laugh at her, instead, he pondered her words carefully.Ruan Jiaojiao didn\u2019t want to provoke the malicious Luo Yunlou and die of unknown cause, not to mention, in a very ugly fashion as well.Seeing Luo Yunlou\u2019s attention being successfully diverted, no longer mentioning about her theft, Ruan Jiaojiao did not let down her guard and quickly suggested.\u201cBrother Luo, it\u2019s rare for you to have come out on a trip. Since you\u2019re already here, let me take you around. This town has a lot of interesting things to see and play with.At this time, the sun was gradually starting to set, the glow spreading through the whole sky, dying the whole town with a magnificent color. Stores started to light up lanterns, lighting up the pavements along the road.Ruan Jiaojiao washed her face clean but still remained dressed as a boy, changing into white clothing just like Luo Yunlou.Whenever she tried to curry favor with someone else, she always knew the right way to do it.Luo Yunlou looked at the petite person standing next to him, feeling slightly odd in his heart.His position in the demonic sect wasn\u2019t low and that was because of his specialty. Almost everyone was a little afraid of him and naturally, his personality made it so that he didn\u2019t like getting close to other people.In truth, he didn\u2019t really plan to settle the matter with Ruan Jiaojiao just for pilfering a few bottles of antidote from him, chasing her a thousand miles here in this remote location. However, since he was feeling a bit bored in the sect, he wanted to look for someone to relieve his boredom.Yet he didn\u2019t expect for the taste to not be bad at all.Ruan Jiaojiao accompanied Luo Yunlou and went eating, playing and strolling around. After several hours had passed, almost all of the stores along the road were about to close but not a word of wanting to rest could be heard out of Luo Yunlou\u2019s lips.She grit her teeth, this should count as settlement right? Her legs were about to fall off from walking and the smiler on her face was stiff.\u201cBrother Luo, are you tired? Let\u2019s head back and rest, if you want, I can accompany you again tomorrow.\u201dLuo Yunlou reached out a hand and pinched her small nose.\u201cYou\u2019re the one who\u2019s tired right? Fine, let\u2019s head back.\u201dHis action seemed a little intimate, making Ruan Jiaojiao feel a little odd.She quickly responded, her nose feeling a little itchy after his touch. He wouldn\u2019t have smeared any poison on it, would he?Back in the inn, upon asking the innkeeper to open another room, they were told that all the rooms had been fully booked.Ruan Jiaojiao sighed. Now that she had offered help, she had to see it through the end. She gave her room up to Luo Yunlou and because she was afraid he would dislike it, she stuffed some silver in the attendant\u2019s hands, asking him to change the mattress to a new one as well as give all the chairs and table a wipe.\u201cJiaojiao, where are you going? Weren\u2019t you tired?\u201dAfter Ruan Jiaojiao helped Luo Yunlou settle down, seeing that he didn\u2019t reveal a dissatisfied expression, she was just about to push the door and leave when she suddenly heard Luo Yunlou ask unhurriedly.Her actions came to a stop. She had already accompanied him to eat, drink and play, did she need to accompany him to sleep as well?Ruan Jiaojiao turned around. She wasn\u2019t someone who knew how to be embarrassed. Moreover, Luo Yunlou didn\u2019t lose to the male lead in terms of looks and temperament, the only difference was probably their physical figure. After all, Luo Yunlou wasn\u2019t a martial artist, he didn\u2019t exactly fit the aesthetics of the martial arts world with his face being on the fairer side.However, this actually only conformed to Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s tastes. Ye Hanzhou and Qi Shen both didn\u2019t know how to be gentle, their muscles were hard and uncomfortable, however, Luo Yunlou\u2019s habit of carrying poison made her hesitate and she was unwilling to come close to him.Then again, she also didn\u2019t want to waste any affection on an uninterested party so she asked directly.\u201cBrother Luo, are you asking me to sleep with you? Are you implying for us to share the same bed ?\u201dAfraid that Luo Yunlou wouldn\u2019t understand, Ruan Jiaojiao even emphasized her words.Luo Yunlou had already started to disrobe and when he heard her question, he calmly cast her a glance.\u201cAccording to my knowledge, Jiaojiao oftens sleeps with Qi Shen so you shouldn\u2019t care about these matters. Moreover, there\u2019s no other room available and we can\u2019t naturally let the beautiful Jiaojiao show her face in public at night in order not to attract any unwanted trouble.\u201dDamn! Now that he hath spoken, he even threw her words back at her.Since Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s suspicions have been cleared and she was also feeling very tired, she didn\u2019t want to go out late at night just to find another available inn and risk revealing her true appearance.People of the Jianghu did not care about trifles and as someone who was mysophic, he didn\u2019t care about it as well. As someone devoid of any moral integrity, what did she have to be afraid of?Ruan Jiaojiao washed up hastily and even climbed onto the bed a step earlier than Luo Yunlou, occupying the space by lying down.Her back was to the outside and even though she was very tired, since there was another man in the room, she naturally couldn\u2019t fall asleep quickly.Just when Luo Yunlou was about to lie down beside her, she turned around and faced him.\u201cBrother Luo, do you want to sleep with me?\u201dSystem who had been silently watching: \u201cPtoo!\u201dWho was the girl who was just hesitating awhile ago? Why did she suddenly bring up this invitation!!Because of her excessively brazen and direct question, Luo Yunlou was also taken aback.Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s hair had already been let loose, her jet-black hair was draped on the pillow like silky satin, the girl\u2019s skin was as fair as snow and her lips were ruddy. She wore thin inner clothes, exposed skin that appeared more tender than tofu, emanating a faint fragrance.Her visage was truly more charming than a flower.Luo Yunlou originally didn\u2019t have any thoughts but suddenly felt an urge arise from her words.In the demonic sect, he didn\u2019t even blink when women tried to tempt him, after all, his appearance and temperance were both outstanding and his position in the sect wasn\u2019t low, coupled with his amazing abilities.However, Luo Yunlou was uninterested in bedroom matters and was solely interested in making poison. After long, everyone assumed he was frigid, and even the sect leader who took pleasure in conferring women as rewards, wouldn\u2019t even think of involving him in his perverted rewards.The same held true for Bai Jingyan. It was as if nothing could interest the man and the two men shared similarities, their relationship in the sect harmonious.Ruan Jiaojiao had even heard rumors that perhaps the two people were gay.And now that the aforementioned person was right here, a curiosity and sense of mischief arose in her.Naturally, she couldn\u2019t ask him directly so she went with a different approach and carried out indirect inquiries, making a decision based on Luo Yunlou\u2019s response.After all, she was extremely pretty, if the man truly didn\u2019t have any thoughts towards her, then the probability of them being gay was really high or of course, they could also just be impotent.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It seemed to tickle Luo Yunlou\u2019s heart, feeling a little itchy.His fingers stroked the girl\u2019s pretty countenance, the belly of his fingers feeling an indescribable softness, like the first bloom of flowers in the morning, tender and even emitting a damp moistness. It would easily break with one pinch yet it incited the urge in people to ravage her.Ruan Jiaojiao looked into Luo Yunlou\u2019s deep gaze, the man\u2019s all-too-familiar desire assailed her, engulfing her within.\u2018Wuu\u2026\u201dLuo Yunlou lowered his head, capturing her soft lips.They were very sweet and very soft. He delved deeper in satisfaction, hooking his tongue with her soft little tongue.Ruan Jiaojiao felt as if she were a piece of candy, licked by this man over and over, feeling herself melting in his lips.After the rain, Mt. Wu was covered by clouds and surrounded with fog. After being kissed dizzy by Luo Yunlou, Ruan Jiaojiao couldn\u2019t help but murmur lowly to herself.\u201cSo you weren\u2019t gay after all\u2026\u201dLuo Yunlou stiffened, his eyes suddenly turning dark.\u201cLittle girl, what did you say?\u201dRuan Jiaojiao inwardly cursed herself, how could she say those words out loud?!Luo Yunlou pinched her chin and Ruan Jiaojiao promptly thought of how to gloss over this matter when suddenly a pill was stuffed into her mouth.Before Ruan Jiaojiao could even recover her senses, Luo Yunlou kissed her once again, using his tongue to push the pill deep into her throat, making her unconsciously swallow it.F*ck! This granny has been tricked!!\u201cWhat did you just give me?!\u201dRuan Jiajiao instantly sobered up and clutched Luo Yunlou\u2019s sleeve in inquiry.The atmosphere between the two people shifted from warm and ambiguous to strange and unpredictable.Luo Yunlou smiled and did not say a word. He turned around and reclined at the side, propping his head on an arm, observing her reaction with great interest.Ruan Jiaojiao quickly felt heat overwhelming her like plump white buns being steamed inside a steamer. She peeled off her own thin clothes and still didn\u2019t feel any relief. She got off the bed and guzzled down half of the cool tea on the table.However, she still felt parched and restless. To dispel the heat, it felt as if every pore in her body was emitting moisture, however, after drinking a cup of tea, she was dripping in sweat. To protect her face, Ruan Jiaojiao endured the urge to open the doors and run out naked to take a cold shower.When she endured drinking another half a cup of tea, the heat seemed to have dissipated but in the blink of an eye, she seemed to have been thrown into a thousand-year icehouse, shivering from the chilliness.Sh*t!This sudden temperature change almost made her lose her mind!!Ruan Jiaojiao quickly jumped back into bed, using the quilt to cover herself but even after such, her teeth continued to chatter, goosebumps arising on her body.She grit her teeth in anger and glaring at the mastermind. Tearing the quilt away, she then climbed his body, viciously ripping off his clothes and sticking her ice cold body onto his warm naked body to obtain heat.\u201cBrother Luo, stop joking around\u2026antidote\u2026give me the antidote\u2026\u201dIn front of such sinister force, Ruan Jiaojiao had no choice but to lower her head, she grabbed Luo Yunlou\u2019s already hardened member with her ice cold hands and started playing with it.The only ability she had was naturally her beauty and so, she climbed on top of Luo Yunlou, her long hair streaking across his skin like waterfall, her soft tongue travelling down his neck, making small pecks on his chest and at times gnawing in interchanging strong and soft strengths.The girl\u2019s appearance was like silk, her ice-cold body was like a piece of cold jade wrapped in silk. Luo Yunlou wrapped his arms around her waist and the two bodies stuck close without any gaps.Ruan Jiaojiao sat up on his waist and spread her legs, lifting her butt slightly. After aiming his scorching hot member at her flower cave, she then sat down slowly. Due to the clash of ice and fire from before, her cave was already sopping wet, making the entrance go quite smoothly, all the way until he reached her deepest parts.The two people\u2019s bodies had finally melded together perfectly.Ruan Jiaojiao let out a long sigh, and unsure of whether it was due to having shifted her attention away, her body didn\u2019t feel as cold anymore and she started shaking her waist.\u201cBrother Luo, can you give me the antidote\u2026please\u2026\u201dShe pleaded softly, but on the inside, she had already pricked the petty Luo Yunlou with a thousand needles.Luo Yunlou\u2019s pupils were dark and he looked at her with a mysterious smile, allowing her to clamp onto his \u2018little brother\u2019 and move without stopping or urging.\u201cI\u2019m your antidote so if you want to dispel the drug\u2019s effect then you better move and get it yourself.\u201dWhat? The f*ck was he talking about?Ruan Jiaojiao was confused upon hearing his words.However, Luo Yunlou merely kept his mouth shut and didn\u2019t further clarify his response.Ruan Jiaojiao ruminated the meaning of his words. Was he saying what she was thinking? This bastard wouldn\u2019t be that unreasonable, would he?Was he saying that his \u201cthing\u201d was an antidote, that\u2019s impossible?!But before she could even continue to ponder over this matter, a new wave of ice and fire washed over her body once again but even when she felt the scorching heat overtaking her, she felt Luo Yunlou\u2019s body turn cool and every move she made, dissipated her heat slightly, making her body feel slightly better.Without a care for anything else, no matter what the facts of the matter were, she decided to just do him!This granny wasn\u2019t afraid of doing a man!The problem was, Ruan Jiaojiao felt unbearably hot as if her butt had caught on fire and she was urgently trying to douse it. Moreover, this body didn\u2019t have enough strength, and come to think of it, she had just spent the whole day strolling around with this b*stard so her waist and legs were both sore. In that scenario, how could she have enough energy to squeeze it out of him?It was fine with Ye Hanzhou and Qi Shen since she only needed to lie down and wait for them to do all the work but she didn\u2019t expect that Luo Yunlou wouldn\u2019t exert the least bit of effort at all.And in matters of the bed, if the other party didn\u2019t put in effort, it only implied that your charms weren\u2019t enough. Apart from her body, Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s heart was also on fire, growing angry at the person in front of her.She bent her waist, hooking both arms around Luo Yunlou\u2019s neck.\u201cBrother Luo, Jiaojiao really doesn\u2019t have any strength left\u2026.Good brother, please give it to me quickly\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She narrowed her eyes dangerously, it looks like she had really kicked an iron plate.Hmph!Even when such a cute little beauty like her took the initiative to plead, he was actually unaffected!Ruan Jiaojiao gnashed her teeth in anger. She had never eaten such a loss using this beautiful countenance of her in front of any man. After being struck with a strong sense of rejection, she no longer begged him and instead started cursing.\u201cLuo Yunlou! You cuckold b*stard! Treacherous, poisonous, petty person! I curse you to be with your poisons for the rest of your life!! Hmph! You should go die from poison!! Get lost!!\u201dAfter she said this contemptuously, she pulled the covers and wrapped it around herself again. She endured the bone-piercing chilliness and quivered while continuing to curse him and even lifting a cold leg to kick him.\u201cB*stard!\u201dMotherf**ker! What a waste of this granny\u2019s beautiful smile and coquettish act. In the end, she had even climbed on top of him. This bastard was so fickle, as expected of an insidious-hearted stinky man.Ruan Jiaojiao suddenly turned arrogant, evident she had been overcome with anger yet Luo Yunlou wasn\u2019t the least bit annoyed by her attitude, instead, mirth could be seen in his gaze, his ink-like eyes revealing delight.Luo Yunlou\u2019s jade-like countenance made people feel a spring breeze brush past them but in Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s eyes, his face was disgusting and she couldn\u2019t wait to return the suffering she was experiencing back to him tenfold.She naturally couldn\u2019t muster any strength, so her kicking only looked to be an act of coquettishness. Taking advantage of the situation, he grabbed her dainty little leg and his warm fingers pinched her cute little toes.\u201cA pity. I was originally going to make you beg for me a little while longer before I give the antidote to you. Even though this brother isn\u2019t someone who had tender, protective feelings for the opposite sex, since Jiaojiao is so cute, my heart finally melted and couldn\u2019t bear it.\u201dRuan Jiaojiao didn\u2019t believe the lies he spouted. She herself wasn\u2019t a good person so to a certain degree, she should actually sympathize with Luo Yunlou.She rolled her eyes and shut them to ignore him, planning to grit her teeth and endure the pain.She already figured him out. This bastard wasn\u2019t moved by persuasion or force. He was sinister and two-faced to the bone. No matter how she reacted, he only took delight in it.Ruan Jiaojiao was like a corpse, wrapped inside the quilt and sure enough, Luo Yunlou eventually grew bored. With her leg in hand, he circled his fingertips on the soles of her foot and the originally stiff girl quivered slightly, making him laugh and scratch it again.\u201cLuo Yunlou!!\u201dShe said through gritted teeth, wanting to break free from his control and pull her own leg back, however, he held onto her ankle ever so tightly, forming a wrestling scene.Ruan Jiaojiao had never been aggravated by anyone until this point. She tore off the covers and opened her mouth, giving his chest a bite. She tried to suckle and didn\u2019t let go.Luo Yunlou was hurt but also felt amused. The sensation was like a little kitten whose fur stood on end in anger, brandishing its sharp teeth and claws.He placed a pill beside her lips.\u201cOpen your mouth, it\u2019s the antidote.\u201dRuan Jiaojiao sensed the pill placed beside her lips. As long as she opened her mouth and ate the pill, she could dispel this torturous feeling.However, if she acted according to his whims, it wouldn\u2019t make her feel good.And so, she exerted a little more strength in her teeth, biting him harder before finally swallowing the antidote. She then let go of him and raised a hand to wipe her mouth, looking at the deep teeth marks she had left on his chest provocatively.Luo Yunlou stroked the teeth marks, feeling a little helpless.\u201cWere you starved of meat these past few days?\u201dRuan Jiaojiao was too lazy to bother with him. He didn\u2019t lie to her. The pill was indeed the antidote. Like a deflated ball, she wanted to collapse but after having eaten losses, she no longer wanted to stay together with this piece of shit. As such, she dragged her tired body off the bed and picked up the clothes on the ground to wear, preparing to leave.\u201cWhere\u2019s a lady like you going in the middle of a night with unkempt clothes?\u201dLuo Yunlou\u2019s voice slowly rang out behind her.Ruan Jiaojiao didn\u2019t turn her head.\u201cI\u2019m gonna climb some other guy\u2019s bed.\u201dLuo Yunlou\u2019s eyes narrowed dangerously. Ruan Jiaojiao suddenly felt a scary chilliness behind her and before she could even react, she felt a strong force attacking her like a weak bunny falling into the hungry wolf\u2019s mouth.Luo Yunlou carried her and placed her on the table, parting her legs before plunging his hard d*ng into her flower cave.\u201cJiaojiao, do you like climbing men\u2019s beds that much? What a naughty little girl.\u201dHe f**ked her cave, producing \u2018papa\u2019 sounds. His palm also struck her behind making Ruan Jiaojiao feel pain for a moment before quickly being overtaken by pleasure by his violent actions.She narrowed her eyes, her allure slowly spreading. She parted her ruddy lips and coquettishly said.\u201cBrother Luo, are you saying you\u2019re better than me? You clearly know I\u2019m the sect leader\u2019s woman yet you still bully me like this. If Qi Shen were to learn of this, even if you have a high position in the sect, he wouldn\u2019t allow you to live well.\u201dRuan Jiaojiao\u2019s threat only elicited a chuckle out of Luo Yunlou.He pinched her chin and pressed his thin lips against her. His kiss came like a torrential wave, just like his member and Ruan Jiaojiao could only let him do as he pleased, whimpers continuously leaking out of her lips.One the kiss had ended, Luo Yunlou leaned close to her ear and spoke in his usual indifferent tone.\u201cDo you think your Brother Qi can sit in his seat for a long time? Jiaojiao, if you\u2019re trying to look for someone to support you, why not just ask me instead?\u201dRuan Jiaojiao naturally knew what Luo Yunlou was implying.Qi Shen had just succeeded the Demonic Sect Leader\u2019s throne but he didn\u2019t have many accomplishments under his belt at his young age so he naturally had no power to convince the masses. Because of this, several people began to grow restless, scheming to seize the throne, and those who didn\u2019t have any skills, would only attempt to take advantage of the crisis for their personal gain.The demonic sect looked harmonious on the surface but in truth, a storm was about to come, the winds precarious.However, this had nothing to do with Ruan Jiaojiao and she didn\u2019t care for it.It was just that Luo Yunlou\u2019s indifference to her threat made her feel a sense of defeat.Ruan Jiaojiao was just like a fried fish. Luo Yunlou turned her around on the table and entered her from behind. She moaned, deliberately putting on an aggrieved and unwilling expression when in reality, she was exclaiming that this bastard\u2019s techniques weren\u2019t too bad at all, he did her quite good.The only problem was that this table was too hard, the edges poked her stomach and it even made creaking noises scratching the ground. It didn\u2019t look too sturdy.Just as Ruan Jiaojiao worried about the table collapsing, Luo Yunlou seemed to have sensed her worries and turned her over, lifting her up. He let her wrap her legs around him, allowing her to hang onto him.Two bodies stuck close together. Luo Yunlou thr*sted his waist up, hitting Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s sour and soft cave. Copious amounts of liquid flowed down from the place they were joined at and she couldn\u2019t hold back her moan.As Luo Yunlou continued to thr*st into her, he walked towards the bedside and placed her on the bed.Upon lying on the soft bed, Ruan Jiaojiao felt a lot more relaxed like a fish back in water.Luo Yunlou lifted her legs with both arms, raising her body slightly to allow him to penetrate her more easily. Several vigorous thr*sts later, the two bodies quivered, unconsciously holding onto each other more tightly as they reached the pinnacle of bliss together.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Her finger stroked the teeth mark on his chest and recalling the events that occurred just before, she felt amused.\u201cBrother Luo, why do you have such a good relationship with Envoy Bai?\u201dRuan Jiaojiao suddenly asked.She really kept poking the beehive.Luo Yunlou had also heard of the rumors claiming that he and Bai Jingyan were gay since the two were unapproachable to women and there were many wretched people in the demonic sect.However, he was in a good mood right now so he lifted Ruan Jiaojiao on top of him and the two people stuck their faces together. He looked into her strangely sparkling eyes and asked back with a smile.\u201cWhy does Ruan Jiaojiao think?\u201dRuan Jiaojiao seriously pondered over it.It was not that she couldn\u2019t understand Bai Jingyan but that man had already watched her do the deed twice with an expressionless face. Moreover, she had previously tried to seduce him with her charms, innocently leaping into his arms and teasing him for instance but that man didn\u2019t seem to be the least bit flustered.\u201cBrother Luo is definitely not gay but it\u2019s hard to say the same for Envoy Bai.\u201dAfter Ruan Jiaojiao said these words, she suddenly heard a cold voice coming from the ceiling of the room.\u201cHow can you be so sure?\u201dRuan Jiaojiao\u2019s eyes widened in incredulity. Impossible. Due to past events casting a shadow on her heart, she specially looked up at the ceiling several times and even when she was lying on the table getting done by Luo Yunlou, she confirmed that there was clearly nobody above.Was Bai Jingyan a ghost?Why did he appear and disappear like a spirit and still hadn\u2019t gone yet?To tell the truth, Ruan Jiaojiao had already gotten numb to Bai Jingyan\u2019s sudden appearance.She turned over from Luo Yunlou\u2019s body and pulled the quilt to cover her naked glory.\u201cBrother Bai, you sure have a unique fetish of peeping at other people doing the deed.\u201dBai Jingyan stood by the bedside and the two people on bed looked very calm, not the least bit embarrassed by someone catching them red-handed in the act.\u201cI was entrusted by the sect leader to help Jiaojiao find the whereabouts of your biological parents and rushed over as soon as I received information.\u201dHm?Ruan Jiaojiao didn\u2019t expect that Bai Jingyan would actually come because of this matter and immediately sat up, asking.\u201cAre there any news about my parents?!\u201dShe had truly searched high and low, spending several days in this place but couldn\u2019t find any clues at all, already feeling like this task was as difficult as finding a needle at the bottom of the sea.The demonic sect had eyes everywhere and now that Qi Shen was sect leader, once he had given his command, he only needed to expend half the effort to achieve twice the effect.If she had thought of this early on, she probably would\u2019ve saved up a lot of effort.Ruan Jiaojiao cursed her own stupidity. Since it was like this, why didn\u2019t Qi Shen tell her sooner?As if having seen through her thoughts, Bai Jingyan did not immediately respond to her question and sat down on the bedside, unhurriedly saying.\u201cThe sect leader let you out so that he could easily clean up the pesky insects inside the sect.\u201dRuan Jiaojiao immediately understood. Qi Shen allowed her to leave in order to purge the sect as well as prevent others from finding out their new relationship in case they used her as blackmail.Towards Qi Shen who had already taken everything into consideration, Ruan Jiaojiao felt a sense of gratification as though the child she had raised had finally grown up.\u201cWhat did you manage to find?\u201d She then remembered about this matter and immediately asked.\u201cI rushed all the way here but didn\u2019t expect Jiaojiao to be in the middle of enjoying such licentious activities.\u201dBai Jingyan looked meaningfully at the current intimate posture the two people had at this moment.Ruan Jiaojiao had an indifferent look, leaning her face against Luo Yunlou\u2019s jade-like chest, her bright eyes staring straight at Bai Jingyan.Luo Yunlou didn\u2019t interfere with their conversation, twirling his fingers in Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s jet-black hair, playing with it and occasionally sniffing the faint fragrance.Towards Bai Jingyan\u2019s jokes, Ruan Jiaojiao took out her white lotus arm from underneath and placed it weakly on top of the quilt. With this action, her whole shoulder was exposed and one could faintly see the captivating cleavage formed by her flaky chest.\u201cLooks like Envoy Bai plans to keep me on tenterhooks. Since this is the case, let\u2019s leave the rest of the discussion for tomorrow. Brother Luo and I are tired and wish to rest.\u201d She then made a yawn.Bai Jingyan\u2019s unfathomable gaze fell on her arm and wandered all the way to her chest.The candlelight flickered, reflecting the three people\u2019s figures on the wall, among them, the two people stuck close together, remained motionless but the man who originally sat at the bedside slowly pulled his lapels apart and undid his buttons, taking off his outer gown and boots, climbing up the bed.\u201cDidn\u2019t Jiaojiao want to know whether I\u2019m gay or not? Why ask other people when you can personally ask me instead?\u201dShe didn\u2019t want to know anymore!!!Ruan Jiaojiao looked at the man in front approaching her, the look in his eyes akin to a sleeping beast being roused.Luo Yunlou and Bai Jingyan seemed to have reached a tacit agreement and sandwiched her in between.With three people underneath the covers, it inevitably felt a bit crowded.Ruan Jiaojiao secretly thought to herself. If that h*rny and lecherous ex-sect leader of theirs were to see this sight of the two reclusive and aloof men, his jaw would no doubt drop in surprise.However, Bai Jingyan merely pinched her face and succinctly responded.\u201cNo. Go to sleep.\u201d???Ruan Jiaojiao had a question mark on her face.Motherf**ker, the two men really did go to sleep.A naked jade-like beauty was lying beside them and the two had actually gone ahead to sleep.Fine, it was all her fault for having some expectations towards a thr**some.If they didn\u2019t want to do it, that\u2019s fine. This granny will treasure you a bit more. Even though your faces and figures aren\u2019t bad, she was also indeed exhausted and tired. If they had really taken action, she probably wouldn\u2019t have lasted long anyways.In the midst of her complaints and mutters, Ruan Jiaojiao eventually fell into slumber.A good night of sleep passed.She dreamed herself having s*x with two handsome men all throughout the night, losing herself in extreme pleasure.By the time she woke, she realized she was lying in between two handsome men and at one point, felt befuddled as to whether she was still in a dream or not.Ruan Jiaojiao reached her claws out, stroking left and groping right.Then, she suffered a counterattack.Both her hands were captured and after turning her head to the left and then right, she put on a smile.\u201cBrother Bai, Brother Luo, good morning..\u201dMorning my ass! The sun had been up long ago.\u201cDid Jiaojiao have a good rest?\u201d Bai Jingyan held her little hand with one hand and his head with the other, his deep eyes locked firmly onto her.\u201cI did.\u201d She responded.Perhaps because she had men left and right, she felt particularly safe, her sleep sound. After waking up, she only felt refreshed.\u201cAlright, then let\u2019s continue yesterday\u2019s subject.\u201dRuan Jiaojiao blinked her innocent eyes and was confused for a moment.Bai Jingyan pulled her wrist and turned her over, pressing her under him. His slightly cold lips covered hers lightly like a dragonfly touching the water.Ruan Jiaojiao then suddenly recalled that she had gotten impatient over Bai Jingyan\u2019s withholding of information last night and suggested to put the matter off until tomorrow as she was tired and wanted to make Bai Jingyan leave. In the end, he had disrobed himself and climbed onto the same bed, sleeping together with them.\u201cWu\u2026\u201dShe turned her face away, pressing both hands on Bai Jingyan\u2019s chest, avoiding his kiss.\u201cThen why don\u2019t you start talking about it.\u201d Don\u2019t start groping me and even kissing me.It was not appropriate to do such activities in the morning.However, Bai Jingyan only seemed to be more invigorated, his thick length pressed in between her legs, its existence extremely hard to ignore.\u201cI\u2019ll say it while doing you.\u201dHe then pulled down his trousers, and spread her legs, wanting to insert it, completely unlike his usual mysterious character and instead, rather more like an impatient lecher.Ruan Jiaojiao clamped her legs together and pressed both hands on his chest, expressing her refusal.\u201cEnvoy Bai!! Don\u2019t you dare!!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 66": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Being PAPA\u2019d Every Time I TransmigrateChapter 64 [3rd World 21] SavagePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayA flame lit up in Bai Jingyan\u2019s deep eyes and they burned even more brightly because of her refusal.\u201cNo! I don\u2019t want it!!\u201dRuan Jiaojiao appeared to be resisting strongly but in reality, she didn\u2019t feel any pain from Bai Jingyan and as long as he exerted a spurt of energy, they would instantly be able to get close but Bai Jingyan clearly did not budge and the two fell into a weird stalemate.Luo Yunlou stuck in between the two and reached out a hand to part the strands of hair covering Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s face. Just as she turned her head, her little face was revealed, her bright eyes brimming with a mischievous smile and her ruddy lips were raised up slightly, reluctance and rejection nowhere to be found.She had clearly been putting on an embarrassed act!The system had almost been tricked. It even felt surprised why the host suddenly acted like she had principles.\u201cHahaha\u2026.\u201dAfter it was revealed that she had just been teasing Bai Jingyan, Ruan Jiaojiao started laughing but in the next instant, the smile on her face stiffened.And that was because Bai Jingyan had dropped his waist and pierced her entrance, impaling her to the very depths. Upon invading her passage, his scorching hot rod immediately spread her little cave open, filling her up to the brim.\u201cAhhhh\u2026.\u201dRuan Jiaojiao couldn\u2019t withstand such a sudden entrance, her petite body quivered and a moan escaped her lips mixed with pleasure and pain.Bai Jingyan was overwhelmed by his desire and also felt a little annoyed by her mischievous teasing. Seeing that the little girl truly looked as though she was in pain, he felt distress again and quickly pulled out, spreading her legs to check whether he had truly harmed her.This was the first time he was seeing a woman\u2019s privates so close and it was such a tiny little hole. He wondered how a man\u2019s thick length would be able to enter inside.To a certain degree, he indeed had a cold temperament and held no interest in the affairs between man and woman. When he saw the sect leader engaging in debauchery back in the sect, he treated it as if they were no different to mating beasts.His heart was like still water, calm and without ripples. Even if a beauty with a gorgeous figure was done by a man\u2019s malevolent and ugly member, he did not think that the scene would be pretty, instead, he regarded it as something dirty to the eyes and held no desire.Bai Jingyan saw her make love with Ye Hanzhou and in his eyes, Ruan Jiaojiao was just a little girl whose character was a little mischievous and quick-witted but she was also cute and interesting. It was rare for him to show any interest in someone but he didn\u2019t treat her any different to small pets.After all, he had watched her grow up from a little doll and knew that she often climbed into Qi Shen\u2019s bed, merely treating it as though she was lonely and pitiful, looking for a companion.When he saw the girl grow up and obtain pleasure from a man\u2019s \u2018little brother, he suddenly realized the little girl was nowhere to be found, having already learnt of the matters between man and woman.After all, for a murky place like the demonic sect, it was only natural to be influenced.However, at the same time, he could also feel that he was unhappy, as if something had tainted his possession.As it turns out, he had already unwittingly claimed her as his own.She had never lacked other people\u2019s protection or other men\u2019s love, but for him, it was a whole new experience.Bai Jingyan had never felt any desire or impulse in his life but this all changed with this young girl.Her b*soms were still developing but the little round jade mounds suited his appetite, looking like newborn baby pigeons, white and soft with red little beaks. Bai Jingyan lowered his head and took in one of the n*ps to gnaw on. Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s body quivered slightly from the stimulation and she couldn\u2019t help but grab onto his hair, her fingers combing through the man\u2019s ink-black hair as though she was inviting him, hoping he would continue, and use a little more strength, delve in a little deeper, and treat her a little rougher.Bai Jingyan\u2019s eyes grew darker and he no longer hesitated, lifting up her legs and aiming at her tiny flower seams. He once again plunged his whole length into her, and nearly lost his soul from the pleasure of being wrapped around tightly by that warm cave. His head turned blank for a moment, seeing the young girl\u2019s face overlap with the beauty\u2019s face lying under him.Perhaps this was how it felt to like somebody. He had fallen in love with her and was able to accept everything about her, even if she was a stubborn little liar. She wasn\u2019t the innocent and guileless person she made herself out to be in public but was actually a cunning person who played with people\u2019s hearts, like a minx who would bewitch men and squeeze them dry, frolicking in the human world without a care.If Ruan Jiaojiao was only playing with Qi Shen, she was no longer the delicate little flower he had raised in Bai Jingyan\u2019s eyes. Now that the flower had already bloomed into a gorgeous appearance, he could pluck her as much as he wanted and suck her sweet nectar.Luo Yunlou looked at the man and woman entangle together as if no one else were around. Though he felt a mix of complicated feelings on the inside, on the surface, he looked calm and unruffled, just like a bystander.Even though he and Bai Jingyan weren\u2019t gay, they were indeed very close and that was because of a secret tale.He and Bai Jingyan had a venomous insect inside their bodies, and this was something planted by Qi Zhanfeng in order to control them.After all, their martial arts were very remarkable, making the sect leader Qi Zhanfeng anxious, and so, to hit two birds with one stone, he inflicted them both with the insect.That was how his destiny had become tied with Bai Jingyan\u2019s. If one of them died, the other could not survive.Slowly, the two had developed a tacit understanding and the two cold-hearted people cherished each other. Though they were not brothers, their relationship exceeded that of blood brothers so perhaps, the reason why he treated Ruan Jiaojiao rather specially was also because of Bai Jingyan.Though that was only a case of perhaps. But for now, this wasn\u2019t bad at all.He had never cared for creatures like women and had never felt any desire but this girl had easily provoked them, making them turbulently rush forth, going out of control.Luo Yunlou\u2019s fingers stroked Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s smooth back, her beautiful butterfly bones <sup>1</sup> butterfly bones: shoulder blades , as well as her alluring waist, and perky rump. At this moment, her soft body was being pierced by a man\u2019s robust body and the area that the two were joined at produced sloshing noises, liquid trickling out, wetting the mattress.He was a mysophobic person but upon seeing this scene, he didn\u2019t think it dirty. Instead, his desire arose, prompting thoughts of wanting to join to form.Bai Jingyan\u2019s gaze shifted, meeting Luo Yunlou\u2019s eyes. The tacit understanding they had cultivated for several years made him turn Ruan Jiaojiao around. He laid on the bed and carried Ruan Jiaojiao on top of him while his third arm continued to thr*st upwards, pounding her cave.Ruan Jiaojiao had been done sour and sore by him and felt unspeakable joy and pleasure but at this time, a warm naked figure stuck close to her back so she couldn\u2019t help but tremble inadvertently from excitement.Her long awaited thr**some that she just dreamt off last night! Was it finally going to come now?Immediately afterwards, Ruan Jiaojiao felt her chrysanthemum <sup>2</sup> Chrysanthemum: euphemism for butthole tighten, as if something had poked it.No! No! No!She didn\u2019t want to get done there!!! Her internal thoughts were immediately filled with refusal.Fortunately, Luo Yunlou didn\u2019t have this intention, his slender fingers merely streaked past the seams of her butt until it reached a damp place.As expected, women were made of water.Luo Yunlou thought to himself.He didn\u2019t press down on top of Ruan Jiaojiao and instead, situated himself behind her, using her hands to lift Ruan Jiaojiao up, his hands covering her petite little mounds, rubbing them.Last night, he wasn\u2019t able to properly experience this girl\u2019s body so at this time, Luo Yunlou rubbed Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s female features with gusto, thinking to himself with wonder. \u2018So this was how it felt.\u2019While Bai Jingyan did Ruan Jiaojiao to seventh heaven, Luo Yunlou kept rubbing and pinching all over her body.With such heavy stimulation from both sides, she quickly reached cl*max and after letting out a moan, her body turned soft, falling into Luo Yunlou\u2019s arms.The two men promptly changed positions.Bai Jingyan had yet to ej*c*late but he didn\u2019t rush it. He was originally a patient person. Luo Yunlou held his stick and smoothly inserted it in the girl\u2019s murkily wet honeypot.The three people engaged in coitus, passionately engrossed in the exciting activity in bed all the way until nightfall. Ruan Jiaojiao finally got sick of eating such a lavish meal and heartlessly refused the two people\u2019s request for more, asking for supper.By the time she had eaten and drank to her fill, the two men then carried her to bed once again and engaged in another three hundred rounds.Ruan Jiaojiao nearly barfed from being excessively done.As expected. the inhumane battle prowess of the martial arts world was indeed very savage.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In any case, with her character, she only did as she pleased.And so, when she met the two middle-aged couple who seemed to be dressed in well-off clothes and had a remarkable temperament, she bluntly asked them a few questions expressionlessly.\u201cAm I your daughter?\u201dRuan Jiaojiao remembered that when the original owner met Ruan Dacheng, he was still a beggar dressed in ragged clothes. If it weren\u2019t for the mission requirements, she would\u2019ve already thought they were dead.The original owner\u2019s memories of her parents were a blank slate. The only thing she remembered was that she was raised by an old beggar and had to beg along with him on the roadside. For the sake of survival, she even had to pilfer and steal.One winter, the old beggar died of sickness. She hid under the foot of the wall, quivering, but such a small girl was still evidently visible even mixed amongst a group beggars. When Ruan Dacheng passed by, recalling how alone his wife Yuan Sanliang was, he then brought her home, but he didn\u2019t think that Yuan Sanliang wouldn\u2019t treat her nicely, even maltreating her.This pair of husband and wife before her gave birth to her but didn\u2019t raise her. In Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s hearts, they weren\u2019t even worth looking for, instead, it was probably even better to latch off the big tree that was the Demonic Sect and cool off under their shade.When the middle-aged woman laid eyes on her, her feelings seemed to have been stirred. She wanted to rush over and hug her but seeing the seemingly unkind men surrounding Ruan Jiaojiao, she didn\u2019t dare step forward.Ruan Jiaojiao actually measured the woman\u2019s appearance that shared similarities with hers and was certain that they had found the right person. She could see that the woman must\u2019ve been a bright-eyed beauty when she was young, however, the passage of time wasn\u2019t kind to anyone, now that she was old, she had put on weight.The middle-aged man had a heroic appearance, seeming as if he was also a good-looking guy in his younger years but the excellent life he had made him look big-hearted and easygoing.From the woman\u2019s explanation, Ruan Jiaojiao was able to piece together a general idea.It wasn\u2019t really a story with great bitterness and deep hatred. The original owner was merely an unfortunate soul who was the daughter of a wealthy family but her caretaker was one who held nefarious thoughts, silently slipping her out in exchange for her own daughter and throwing her away.However, the baby\u2019s features weren\u2019t prominent in their infant stage, By the time the caretaker\u2019s daughter\u2019s features were more pronounced, she didn\u2019t look like the father nor the mother at all. The saying that \u201ceven if you wear the dragon robe, you still won\u2019t look like the crown prince\u201d even came to mind. <sup>1</sup> Dragon robe is the attire that only the crown prince is allowed to waer. This saying is used to mock people trying to pretend to be someone else because they can easily see through them. She also looked a bit ugly, looking more like the caretaker.Harboring these suspicions in heart, it was only later on that this matter was exposed but this had already happened several years ago.It was not that they hadn\u2019t thought of looking for her but not only couldn\u2019t they find her, they also had another child so thoughts of looking for her slowly dissipated.What a dull story.Ruan Jiaojiao sighed after she finished listening to it.This is why a supporting character will only ever be a supporting character, they wouldn\u2019t give her a dramatic past and she also wasn\u2019t some princess or an important character\u2019s child but since she was born with the countenance of a flower and face like the moon, she had simply picked out the best features of her parents\u2019 appearance.\u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d already be this big.\u201dThe woman sighed but in the end, she didn\u2019t raise her for a single day. Even though blood was thicker than water, after truly coming face-to-face, there was an imperceptible barrier between them.\u201cI see. Thank you for giving birth me as well as not deliberately abandoning me. You can go, just treat it as if we haven\u2019t met. I only wanted to ask for an answer.\u201dRuan Jiaojiao looked into the couple\u2019s eyes and saw that even though their eyes revealed a sense of regret, they felt more relief.If one thought about it, it made sense. A group of fiends suddenly kidnapped the two of them to this place and even though she was their daughter, there wasn\u2019t even any gratitude for being raised, they were even afraid she would bear a grudge against them so naturally ordinary people would be afraid.When the husband and wife pair left, Ruan Jiaojiao raised her eyes at the black-dressed Bai Jingyan and white-dressed Luo Yunlou and the corner of her mouth started twitching.Looking at these two men, they looked like two grim reapers. Of course, they were also remarkably handsome, otherwise, how would she have been able to sleep with the two at once?She walked towards them and threw herself in Bai Jingyan\u2019s arms, putting on a weak, sad face and asking for comfort and hugs.If it were the usual, Bai Jingyan would have agreed to many of her requests in order to turn her tears into laughter, however, today was not the same. Bai Jingyan took her hug as an initiative and threw the little lamb to bed. Together with Luo Yunlou, they ate her up cleanly.She had truly lived these last few days promiscuously and degenerately.And while the two men weren\u2019t paying attention, Ruan Jiaojiao slipped away.Now that her mission was completed, she could now hide far away just like before and soar the high skies and wide oceans like a bird.Though Ruan Jiaojiao felt inexplicably reluctant, she still had a lot of time in this world and she wanted to see Qi Shen.The system put on a despicable look, \u201cIn truth, you just want to harvest the Chinese cabbage you\u2019ve carefully raised for many years so you\u2019re unwilling to leave, aren\u2019t you?\u201dHow hateful! If it knew, there was no need to say it out loud!Ruan Jiaojiao scolded it.The system shook out the goosebumps it felt.Different from the past 2 words, there was always a weak spot in people\u2019s hearts. Even though Ruan Jiaojiao was heartless, she still felt reluctant to part with Brother Qi Shen. After all, the two had innocently shared a bed for many years, so this little guy took a very deep root in her heart.\u201cIf you\u2019re willing, you can also accompany him until the end of this world.\u201d The system suddenly said.\u201cThere\u2019s such a setting?\u201d Ruan Jiaojiao couldn\u2019t help but be curious.\u201cSince you have finished your mission remarkably and efficiently, there\u2019s a reward.\u201d\u201cThen if I want to go back to the two previous worlds, is that also fine?\u201d Ruan Jiaojiao mischievously asked.\u201cYou can if you accumulate enough reward points. Didn\u2019t I tell you a detailed guide before?\u201d The system said a little tiredly.What guide? Ruan Jiaojiao was naturally too lazy to listen to the whole thing.She was never the type of person who would read the instruction manual and just rolled up her sleeves to do it instead.And so, the system could only repeat the whole guide again and now knowing that there were rewards, Ruan Jiaojiao adopted a patient character and listened to the whole thing before turning silent for a good while until she suddenly smacked her leg.Motherf**ker! She had just wasted the opportunity to accumulate more points in the last two worlds!The heartache was akin to losing a wallet, making her unable to breathe.\u201cIt\u2019s all your fault! If only you had actually brought it up before, you broken crappy system!!\u201d Ruan Jiaojiao pinned all the blame on the system.System remained silent, putting on a cold face.\u201cAlright, since we\u2019re both on the same boat, I\u2019m good, you\u2019re good. I\u2019m amazing, you\u2019re also amazing, I\u2019ll start earning all the reward points so you have to start letting me know from now on alright?\u201d Ruan Jiaojiao quickly cheered back up, silently resolving to earn it a hundred million points.\u201cThen\u2026how many points do I have right now?\u201d\u201cThe index of finishing three world\u2019s missions is a hundred percent so now you have 300 points.\u201d\u201cThen, how many points do I need to be able to select the background of the story?\u201d Ruan Jiaojiao was very interested in this, she had a lot of dreams she wanted to fulfill.\u201cA thousand points.\u201dRuan Jiaojiao: \u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be dispirited, host. There are a lot of side quests in this world, the highest points you can get is about 800.\u201dRuan Jiaojiao instantly became rejuvenated but when she finished looking at the list of missions, she immediately felt like she was deceived.These side missions\u2026.were simply too crazy!She stared fixated at the side mission that held the highest number of points.\u201cWhat is Love\u201d<Torture the male lead so much that he wishes he were dead and after going back and forth and hovering between life and death, make him hate you so much that he wishes to stab you but also couldn\u2019t bear to.>What the hell was this?The system suddenly changed and started wretchedly coming up a scheme for her.\u201cFor example, get married to the male lead and have his child, allowing him to soak in happiness then in the later part of the story, let him catch you having an affair and do it several times to the point he will want to kill a wh*re like you but wouldn\u2019t really do it for the sake of the child. After all, the mission is already completed so we can be flexible~\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Where\u2019d they all go?Ruan Jiaojiao held her breath and listened to the noise, finally hearing an anguished wail ring from afar, immediately hurrying her steps.What\u2019s going on? Did the Upright Sect come to attack them?That\u2019s not right, it\u2019s only been 10 short days and they had taken a huge hit, stripped of a leader, how could they suddenly launch an attack on them?Seeing the demonic people strewn on the ground, Ruan Jiaojiao bent down to inspect them and saw that they all received varying degrees of sword injuries but fortunately, the assassin did not take their life with a single stroke of his sword, leaving them alive. It looked like his purpose was not for revenge.\u201cIt was Ye Hanzhou.\u201d A slightly injured person dispelled Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s doubts.So that was the reason.Ye Hanzhou was the male lead so Ruan Jiaojiao knew immediately he had the lead\u2019s halo and if he died, this world would crumble.\u201cDon\u2019t leave me. I\u2019ll go to the demonic sect and find you even if I have to tread through fire and water, I\u2019ll take you back and confine you by my side with nowhere else to go\u2026\u201dThe words Ye Hanzhou uttered suddenly resounded in Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s ears.Did Ye Hanzhou really infiltrate the tiger\u2019s lair that is the Demonic Sect alone just to find her?When Ruan Jiaojiao came across the battle between Ye Hanzhou and Qi Shen, she oddly felt a bit complicated as well as a little annoyed.Ya Hanzhou\u2019s clothes were stained with blood as he obviously faced against many enemies but even if his martial arts was outstanding, he was not made of iron, and so, against many demonic sect people, his sword skills gradually showed signs of dulling.And without Bai Jingyan and Luo Yunlou in the demonic sect, even though Qi Shen had extremely high potential, he had just succeeded the throne and was still young and inexperienced, his strength slightly inferior to Ye Hanzhou\u2019s.The two seemed to have already exchanged many blows but victory and defeat were still yet to be decided.Seeing that the situation did not bode well, Ruan Jiaojiao quietly prepared to flee.Just kidding, seeing this situation happening in front of her, she dashed out. She wasn\u2019t going to help any of the two men, after all, they weren\u2019t even human.However, what Ruan Jiaojiao didn\u2019t think was that, Lu Xueyan who was following Ye Hanzhou, caught her furtive figure and called out.\u201cWhere are you trying to escape too, enchantress!\u201dRuan Jiaojiao\u2019s figure paused for a second but she didn\u2019t turn her head and instead ran even quicker.However, Ye Hanzhou already discovered her and stopped fighting with Qi Shen, leaping over towards her and blocking her path.\u201cAs expected, you\u2019re here.\u201dHaving not seen her for a long time, Ye Hanzhou\u2019s gaze became cold and complicated as he immediately grabbed Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s wrist.He had originally come for her and now that he had seen her, he only wanted to take her away.Qi Shen\u2019s qigong wasn\u2019t on par with Ye Hanzhou so he was one step slower. He held his sword planning to bar them but seeing Ruan Jiaojiao seized by Ye Hanzhou, he restrained the gloominess he felt and somewhat angrily asked Ruan Jiaojiao.\u201cWhy did you come back alone? Where\u2019s Envoy Bai?\u201dFaced with Qi Shen\u2019s eyes, Ruan Jiaojiao really wanted to throw herself over and ask him for comfort and hug but now that she had fallen into Ye Hanzhou\u2019s hands, she acted like a fish on a chopping block.She knew that Ye Hanzhou held a lot of suspicions towards her at this moment, even feeling that their meeting was also a scheme, a carefully arranged honey trap for him.Ye Hanzhou naturally didn\u2019t do a sloppy job and before the two could even exchange any words, he lifted Ruan Jiaojiao up and used qigong to quickly get away.At this moment, Ruan Jiaojiao felt a bit grateful that the female lead was trying to obstruct them, her aggrieved voice ringing out.\u201cBrother Ye, are you really going to leave me here alone?\u201dHe naturally couldn\u2019t.Ye Hanzhou also didn\u2019t expect Lu Xueyan to actually chase him up until here but since she had saved his life, he had to repay his gratitude, unable to leave a girl like her alone in the demonic sect.At this time, Qi Shen seized this opportunity and taking advantage of Ye Hanzhou\u2019s hesitation, he immediately pressed his sword against Lu Xueyan\u2019s neck, the sharp sword piercing her tender skin, oozing blood.Qi Shen\u2019s gaze was ruthless and he emitted a vicious air around him as if he was going to spill Lu Xueyan\u2019s blood and allow the tender girl to lose her life the next moment.\u201cLet go of Jiaojiao!\u201dEven though Ye Hanzhou owed Lu Xueyan a debt for saving his life, he was also annoyed at the girl at this moment for getting in the way and making him fall into this quagmire.However, he merely loosened his hold and Ruan Jiaojiao immediately leapt away from him.Truly such a plot reversal.The two people exchange hostages and Ruan Jiaojiao fell into Qi Shen\u2019s arms just as she wished.Seeing this, Ye Hanzhou\u2019s anger burned even brighter, how could he just give up like this? He was just about to go have another round with him when Lu Xueyan fainted right at this moment.He couldn\u2019t neglect her safety so he could only take Lu Xueyan away and form another plan.The male lead was without a doubt the male lead, he overcame all hardships and fought his way into the demonic sect, making them almost suffer a crushing defeat. If it weren\u2019t for the female lead being a burden, he would\u2019ve probably succeeded.Ruan Jiaojiao felt a little guilty, she was certainly such a big femme fatale\u2026Qi Shen didn\u2019t care for the injured people of the demonic sect and dragged Jiaojiao all the way to the secret room.Once the stone doors closed, they were isolated from the outside world and apart from silence that pervaded the whole area, they could only hear each other\u2019s breathing.The cold gloomy air that surrounded Qi Shen immediately dissipated like melting snow and he carried Ruan Jiaojiao in one motion, hating that he couldn\u2019t meld her into his bones.\u201cFortunately, he didn\u2019t take you away\u2026\u201dRuan Jiaojiao felt her heart sour hearing his words but Qi Shen cupped her little face and before she could even say any words of comfort, he gave her a powerful kiss, engulfing her with his passionate feelings.How she had long missed this fresh and delicious white cabbage\u2026Ptoo Ptoo Ptoo! It was all that system\u2019s fault for using that analogy, she wasn\u2019t the pig who dug up the cabbage. <sup>1</sup> There\u2019s a Chinese fable about pig digging up cabbage but basically it means the cabbage that farmers raised with hard work was ruined by the pig who dug them up.Ruan Jiaojiao passionately responded back to Qi Shen and the two quickly rolled on the jade stone bed. Only the sect leader knew where the mechanism to open the secret room was so no matter what kind of forces were outside, they wouldn\u2019t be able to get in.The two people spent several hours rolling in bed together until their stomachs started rumbling with hunger and they finally reluctantly put on their clothes and went out.Qi Shen went to tidy up the terrible mess Ye Hanzhou made whereas Ruan Jiaojiao went to forage for food in the kitchen but didn\u2019t expect that Ye Hanzhou would come back, knocking her out on her way back to the room with a filled belly and taking her away.Motherf**ker!When Ruan Jiaojiao woke up, she discovered a restraint on her ankle, and it was actually the kind of iron cuff where only a key could open it.It looked like Ye Hanzhou was really determined to trap her.She surveyed her surroundings and discovered that she was in a simple and crude straw house which was most likely in a village near the demonic sect.Ye Hanzhou was keeping watch at the side and seeing that she had awoken, he poured her some tea.Not wanting to suffer, Ruan Jiaojiao decided to act like a well-behaved prisoner and drank the whole contents before lowering her eyes and waiting for Ye Hanzhou to start speaking.For every question Ye Hanzhou asked, Ruan Jiaojiao answered honestly, never slipping in a single lie.The two people\u2019s meeting was truly a coincidence and not planned in secret but the demonic sect did indeed kill Lu Yuanpeng and burn the Free Manor without her participation.However, she was not entirely innocent as she clearly knew that the demonic sect would infiltrate the manor but she feigned cluelessness and didn\u2019t inform Ye Hanzhou.\u201cI was originally a member of the Demonic Sect, I won\u2019t suddenly become a traitor to them.\u201dShe calmly looked at Ye Hanzhou and didn\u2019t care how much of her words Ye Hanzhou believed in.Ye Hanzhou\u2019s eyes were dark and profound but at this time, an angry scream sounded from the outside and Lu Xueyan pushed the doors and came in.\u201cBrother Ye, don\u2019t believe this enchantress\u2019s words, she\u2019s glib-tongued and her mouth is full of lies! The demonic sect people have always been incomparably shameless and licentious. This enchantress must\u2019ve been in a secret affair with that Qi Shen from the very beginning but she still shamelessly seduced you!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

And precisely because of this, she discarded her self-respect. Even if Ye Hanzhou treated her coldly, she was going to hold onto him tightly.The structure of the martial arts circle today had been turned into a state of mess all because of the demonic sect\u2019s plan, however, there was one rule that forever never changed.Strength triumphed over all.As long as she followed Ye Hanzohu, she wouldn\u2019t be just another normal citizen and would have a bright future.However, no matter how much she pestered and tried to coerce him with gratitude, Ye Hanzhou still treated her coldly and heartlessly but towards that girl, for her sake, he even infiltrated the demonic sect alone, looking for her everywhere. Regardless of whether it was love or hate, Ye Hanzhou\u2019s heart only seemed to hold her, all his deep affections reserved just for her.For a moment, all kinds of negative feelings like jealousy, hatred, anger and Irreconciliation, welled up in Lu Xueyan\u2019s chest.The man in her heart was just as shallow as Lu Yuanpeng, in the end only being charmed by the beauty of the enchantress. Even someone like Ye Hanzhou also coveted beauties, even if he knew she was a snake-hearted beauty.What if she cut up her face and destroyed her appearance?Lu Xueyan stared at Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s face immediately and at this moment, as if having detected it, Ruan Jiaojiao also looked at her.That was because the system said gleefully.\u201cYou\u2019ve angered the female lead into blackening. She\u2019s currently planning to disfigure your face.\u201dRuan Jiaojiao: \u201c\u2026.\u201dYe Hanzhou turned a deaf ear towards Lu Xueyan\u2019s words and coldly cast a glance at her.\u201cGet out.\u201dLu Xueyan\u2019s expression froze but she knew that even if she thickened her skin and refused to go, she couldn\u2019t control Ye Hanzhou and would instead, incite his annoyance.After she left, Ruan Jiaojiao scratched her ears. It had finally become quiet. That woman was really noisy\u2026Ye Hanzhou also probably shared the same thoughts which was why he carried Ruan Jiaojiao and leapt out from the side window.When Lu Xueyan noticed something amiss and pushed the doors open abruptly, the room was completely empty, making her heart chill.Ye Hanzhou brought the woman away and even left her behind. No matter how many things she did for him, going through fire and water for him, she still couldn\u2019t win against the shameless enchantress.Lu Xueyan stood inside the room in a daze when a cold breeze struck her from behind and immediately, a sword was pressed against her neck.\u201cWhere\u2019s Ye Hanzhou?\u201dHer heart had died and turned into dust at this moment. Even if she had fallen into the demonic sect\u2019s hands, she didn\u2019t feel much emotions arise, bitterly laughing.\u201cHe\u2019s gone and he has taken that enchantress together with him\u2026\u201dHearing this, the man\u2019s eyes turned gloomy and he instantly knocked Lu Xueyan unconscious, ordering his subordinates.\u201cTake her away.\u201dThree months later.It was the twelfth lunar month of the severe winter.At a small town on the frontier of the bitterly cold north.It was so cold, so f**king cold.Ruan Jiaojiao wore a thick mink fur coat, her cap lined with white fox fur, making her face look more petite and exquisite. Her little face was flushed red from the cold and even if she held a hand stove <sup>1</sup> Hand stove: hand warmer in the ancient times. Picture: in her arms and was curled on top of the heatable brick bed, she was still shivering from the cold.That b*stard Ye Hanzhou!! How dare he kidnap her to this god-knows-where!!Ruan Jiaojiao couldn\u2019t help but curse.The most annoying thing was that the bastard had shackled one of her ankles, connected to a two inch thick nail embedded deeply on a stone wall, simply resolving to keep her confined.Fortunately, he found a magnificent house for her because even though the world outside was made of ice and snow, even if she managed to free herself from the shackles, she probably wouldn\u2019t be able to walk far before turning into an ice sculpture.A creak sounded and Ye Hanzhou stepped into the room. When the door opened, the howling wind blew inside, making Ruan Jiaojiao frown. Seeing this, he quickly shut the door tight.Ye Hanzhou unloaded the prey he carried on his shoulders and immediately walked towards Ruan Jiaojiao.\u201cYou must be hungry. I bought some meat and roasted sweet potatoes from town. Eat them while they\u2019re hot.\u201dAs he said this, he took out the food from his arms. Because of his body temperature, the food was still giving off steam. He took out a pot of wine and poured her some.Ruan Jiaojiao naturally didn\u2019t refuse it.She took the greasy roasted lamb and took a bite out of it, then she picked up a sweet and soft sweet potato and bit on it before lifting the cup of wine and taking a sip. Soon, her belly was filled and her body felt relaxed, the cold dispersing.Satiation and warmth gave rise to lust.Ye Hanzhou had already taken off his cloak early on. The room was warm and beautiful and he also had a flower-like beauty. He traveled around the country, dressed in luxurious clothes, enjoying life but didn\u2019t think that in the end, he would be satisfied by such a plain and warm life, even wishing fervently that this would last forever.\u201cJiaojiao\u2026 Jiaojiao\u2026\u201dYe Hanzhou pressed Ruan Jiaojiao under him, his fingers skillfully and nimbly undoing her linen jacket, peeling her out of the thick clothes and exposing her fair and beautiful body.Ruan Jiaojiao laid on the top of the brick bed, bearing the man\u2019s hot body. His stiff and hot desire invaded her slowly but the picture of a youth\u2019s handsome face surfaced in her head.Seeing her eyes turn misty, Ye Hanzhou knew her mind had wandered and couldn\u2019t help but feel his chest turn stuffy, using more strength. Ruan Jiaojiao moaned, however, her legs were caught by Ye Hanzhou and he parted them even further, pounding the depths of her flower cave even more strongly.He lowered his head and watched her flat belly. He didn\u2019t care who she was thinking about, he merely hoped that she would be able to bear his child.Maternal love was probably an innate characteristic every woman had. If she had his child, it didn\u2019t matter who she was thinking about because in the end, she would remain by his side for the sake of that child.Ye Hanzhou admitted he was a little selfish because he indulged in his warmth. Even if she was poisonous, he was more than willing to drink the poison in hopes of quenching his thirst, and discard everything, only wishing that he could keep her confined by his side.Ye Hanzhou started thrusting faster, Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s arms were wrapped around his neck and on the verge of climaxing, she murmured.\u201cBrother Qi\u2026\u201dHearing her spit out these two words, Ye Hanzhou\u2019s body froze and abruptly turned limp.He had been lying to himself all this time.He was like a beast, forcefully tying her to his side. She pretended to go along with him, entangling bodies with him but treated him as if he were someone else.However, even if he knew the truth, Ye Hanzhou still fell for it.Ye Hanzhou\u2019s heartache grew with each passing day, struggling to deal with the torment he felt every day.As expected, the words she previously uttered were all to deceive him, he wished he could kill her with his sword but his heart ached so much\u2026When Ruan Jiaojiao heard the system tell her that she had successfully achieved her side mission, the points she accumulated growing to 1100, she smirked.She had accompanied this male lead for so long she had already gotten tired of him. Fortunately, her hard work paid off.After putting up an act for a long time, Ruan Jiaojiao had truly become brainwashed, feeling an urgent desire for Little Brother Qi Shen so much that she was almost going crazy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 70": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Being PAPA\u2019d Every Time I TransmigrateChapter 68 [3rd World 25] The EndPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayRuan Jiaojiao really did not want to use such an extreme measure unless it was the right moment.She was afraid of pain, very afraid of it\u2026However, if a weak girl like her was trapped by Ye Hanzhou in such a remote place, and was shackled, the moment she went out, she would only freeze to death so she could only throw a tantrum just like other girls and leave Ye Hanzhou no other choice but to take her away.Ruan Jiaojiao felt that hanging herself wouldn\u2019t look too pretty so she protested through the means of holding a hunger strike.Ye Hanzhou suddenly felt as if Ruan Jiaojiao had turned into a different person, the liveliness she once had instantly disappearing. She was like a walking corpse, not speaking, not eating and not even giving him a single glance.\u201cWhat do you want?\u201dYe Hanzhou looked at her haggard yet beautiful face. Her eyes had lost its previous splendor, like a flower that was on the verge of wilting.At this moment, even though he was tightly holding onto her, he could feel himself almost losing her.\u201cI\u2019ve already returned the 3 months I owed you. Let me go.\u201dRuan Jiaojiao hoarsely spat out these words and turned her face away, no longer looking at him.After Ye Hanzhou had gotten over this brief period of shock, he sighed and could only come to a compromise.He used love as a prison but in the end, he had only trapped himself.Ye Hanzhou wrapped the girl in a big cloak and bought a horse, galloping all the way until they reached the Demonic Sect.Ruan Jiaojiao suffered under the continuous jolting of the horse ride, convincing herself she only needed to bear this for another thousand meters.If the male lead were to know what the girl was thinking, he probably would\u2019ve been angered to the point of spitting out blood.The two people were met with an ambush on the road and Ye Hanzhou warded them off with his sword. The other party didn\u2019t zealously pursue them, taking out a small bamboo pipe and blowing poisonous smoke at them and as mighty as Ye Hanzhou\u2019s power was, he had still managed to breathe a little bit of the smoke caught off guard.Ruan Jiaojiao who was being protected in Ye Hanzhou\u2019s arms, also fainted together with him.By the time she awoke, she found herself lying on an incomparably familiar bed as if she had just dreamt a dream.As expected, it was the people of the demonic sect.Ye Hanzhou must\u2019ve thought he had fallen into the pit she had dug.Ruan Jiaojiao wearily sat up, feeling a dull ache in her head. Her brows scrunched up in worry and her body felt uncomfortable.A porcelain bottle was placed under her nose at this moment and Ruan Jiaojiao took a sniff of it, immediately feeling invigorated.She raised her head and looked at the person, unable to contain her surprise.Luo Yunlou?\u201cWhere\u2019s Qi Shen?\u201d She asked.Upon hearing her ask for Qi Shen the moment she woke up, Luo Yunlou\u2019s eyes turned cold, the small gentle smile on his face revealing a trace of unhappiness.Then, Ruan Jiaojiao grew aware that something was not right. Luo Yunlou did not bring up Qi Shen and only summoned some people to prepare her meals. Though the people who came in to attend to her adopted reverential attitudes, their gazes were also brimming with fear.\u201cSystem, what happened?\u201d Ruan Jiaojiao asked.\u201cDo you want to open God\u2019s view?\u201d The system asked quietly.\u201cNonsense!\u201dRuan Jiaojiao had longed to return to the demonic sect but hadn\u2019t seen Qi Shen. Moreover, the atmosphere was too odd, making it hard for her to adjust to.\u201cDeducting 500 points and opening up God\u2019s view.\u201dPfff! Ruan Jiaojiao spat out a mouth of blood. This shitty system wasn\u2019t like this before. It had been corrupted!Don\u2019t just start extorting her just because she started earning some money!\u201cNonono! I don\u2019t want to open it anymore!!\u201d Ruan Jiaojiao quickly waved her hands trying to stop it.However, the wretched system only responded.\u201cThe command has already gone through host\u2019s confirmation so there\u2019s no way of retracing it. During the time you weren\u2019t here, Bai Jinyan and Luo Yunlou succeeded in seizing the throne and the two rule over the demonic sect together while Qi Shen has been reduced to a prisoner who is currently locked within the same cell as the male and female lead.Ruan Jiaojiao: \u201c\u2026..\u201dAfter a while, she cursed.\u201cYou crappy system!! Why didn\u2019t you say this early on!!\u201dIt wasn\u2019t easy for Ruan Jiaojiao to have returned and she didn\u2019t think that the waves in the demonic sect would turn into another direction. She had merely switched from being in Ye Hanzhou\u2019s hand to being in Bai Jingyan and Luo Yunlou\u2019s hands, even walking right into the trap herself.She had tried slipping into the prisons thrice but was always captured and brought back by Bai Jingyan, thoroughly disciplined inside and out.Once known as the enchantress who wreaked havoc, she was reduced to becoming the exclusive property of Bai Jingyan and Luo Yunlou.Ruan Jiaojiao screamed internally, she had never felt so unhappy before!In the end, she drew a conclusion. It was all this martial arts world\u2019s fault, and her fault for being too weak.Ruan Jiaojiao had suffered many pent up grievances so she grit her teeth and hardened her resolve, taking all the points she earned and even loaning 500 from the system and exchanged it for a book called the \u201cSunflower Treasury\u201d.The previously adorable girl that the demonic sect knew suddenly changed, learning an exceptionally strong form of martial arts and even defeating Bai Jingyan and Luo Yunlou.Upon possessing such amazing powers to protect herself, Ruan Jiaojiao finally felt proud and elated, rising to the position of the sect leader in one fell swoop.In this big turnaround of events, the sect people were also taken aback and could only worship her.However, having their sect leader change thrice in just a few short months, everyone felt very calm.Ruan Jiaojiao ordered the people to let Qi Shen out and wash him before leaving him on her bed. She felt delighted but upon seeing Qi Shen, her happiness turned into distress.Qi Shen was afflicted with a very toxic poison. Having been tortured to such an inhumane form and after being confined in such a dark prison for so long, his originally handsome and remarkable face had turned grey, his figure scrawny and his expression in a trance. However, as soon as he saw her, his expressionless eyes lit up, he seemed to have wanted to say something but in the end, not a single word came out of his mouth.Ruan Jiaojiao understood that because of Qi Shen\u2019s pride, even if he had been reduced to such an appearance, he wasn\u2019t willing to let himself be pitied by her.She stormed into the prisons angrily, preparing to settle accounts with Bai Jingyan and Luo Yunlou but after walking halfway, she suddenly came to a stop.This was true martial arts. The strong dominated the weak. She couldn\u2019t view this world with the same logic she used in the previous worlds.Moreover, based on Bai Jingyan\u2019s words, Ruan Jiaojiao had learnt that it was Qi Shen who had made the first move of trying to kill them, unable to tolerate anyone who had touched her.Ruan Jiaojiao sighed. This world was simply too cruel.She ordered the people to let all the prisoners out and left behind a note, saying that she wasn\u2019t going to assume the position of sect leader anymore and whoever wanted to do it could take it instead. Then, she took Qi Shen together with her and left.Ruan Jiaojiao took Qi Shen on a scenic tour and the two people were like an immortal couple, enjoying life to their heart\u2019s content, living free without worries.When the two people got bored, they would walk around the Jianghu and occasionally hear rumors of the demonic sect and Ye Hanzhou.Ye Hanzhou had become the martial arts alliance\u2019s head whereas Bai Jingyan and Luo Yunlou both ruled the demonic sect. Both sides fought like fire and water, at times having conflicts but were evenly matched, neither side gaining complete victory, and the enchantress known as Ruan Jiaojiao had become an immortal legend.Regardless of whether it was her bewitching beauty or her sudden gain of strength, there were even people who believed she was the strongest under the heavens but evidently, her ambitions laid elsewhere.Apart from this, the onlookers enjoyed gossiping, saying that the head of the martial arts alliance and the demonic sect leaders were all slaves to her beauty, which was why all three men remained single but there were also rumors that the two leaders of the demonic sect were actually gay.However, Ruan Jiaojiao never heard the female lead\u2019s name being mentioned.Even if she wanted to ask the system, upon recalling the last time she had to open god\u2019s view and was even swindled out of a lot of money, she restrained her urge to do so.She originally thought Lu Xueyan would follow Ye Hanzhou for many years until she came across a group of people on the road and among them was the already married Lu Xueyan who was even accompanied by her two children.In all honesty, the reason why Lu Xueyan put away her ambition and settled for peace and mediocrity was not unrelated to her.Luo Xueyan had previously coveted everything, regardless of whether it was peerless martial arts or men\u2019s admiration or even the public\u2019s admiration which were all what the enchantress or Ruan Jiaojiao had disdained but easily obtained. Moreover, she was even thrown away like a pair of worn out shoes and this fact had completely wrecked her fighting spirit.That was why Lu Xueyan married a head of a small sect she had previously befriended in the Free Manor and even though he didn\u2019t measure up to par to Ye Hanzhou in every aspect, as long as the man treated her well, it was enough for her.From her mother\u2019s experience, Lu Xueyan had finally understood that if she were to marry, it was best to marry a man who truly loved her.In this life, Ruan Jiaojiao spent dozens of years together with Qi Shen and Qi Shen also didn\u2019t seem to feel attached to everything about the demonic sect. The two people later on lived like an ordinary couple living in seclusion in verdant hills and limpid water.Ruan Jiaojiao accompanied Qi Shen until he took his last breath and properly buried him before leaving this world.The system curiously asked her why she had remained in this world for so long.Ruan Jiaojiao rolled her eyes and said. The points that this granny had worked so painstakingly for had all been spent and now she also owed the system 500 points as well. How could she be willing to part with this world who had treated her as the top martial artist under the heavens and enjoy the taste of looking down on others?And for a moment, the system was actually at a loss for words.[End of 3rd Arc]Translator Little Potato: When you only have 1 paper left to write the climax and the conclusion.

This kind of pain, which almost knocked her soul out of her body, was so unbearable that she cried out.\u201cDidn\u2019t you say it\u2019s nothing just now? A cold and gloomy male voice playfully sounded in her ears.In a trance because of the pain, Ruan Jiaojiao focused her blurred vision and saw a handsome and evil looking man.She was shocked.This\u2026 It cannot be human\u2026Ruan Jiaojiao has seen countless beautiful men in the past worlds, but she has never seen such a good-looking man.Seeing her staring blankly, the man curled up his lips and raised his phoenix eyes, revealing a wicked and cold smile, which could make anyone go cold for no reason. He pinched her chin and pounded into her hard. The black cloak covering the man waved with the wind, trapping people like getting covered in heavy mist.Not again!The pain seemed to tear her three souls and seven spirits apart, but she couldn\u2019t struggle free as her body was tightly bound by a biting cold breath that penetrated into her bone marrow, like an invisible rope trapping her.Motherfucker, is this the end? Ruan Jiaojiao thought. She still wants her life!!!Ruan Jiaojiao realised that this world is even more dangerous and terrifying than the last martial arts world.She hurriedly called the system.\u201cIf you torment me like this, this old lady will quit!\u201dThe next moment, Ruan Jiaojiao suddenly felt a warm current pouring into her limbs, her mind wandering away from the unspeakable comfort.She successfully broke free of the forces that restricted her, like a flexible fish freed from the man\u2019s control, she felt that her body was as light as a plume of smoke, allowing her to fly straight into the sky and swim freely.Ruan Jiaojiao didn\u2019t have time to marvel at this mysterious experience as the black mist swept over her. In an instant, she was shrouded in the suffocating sense of pressure that controlled her earlier, feeling like a bird being locked in a cage.The man\u2019s body emerged in the black mist, and her body was frozen and unable to move as if she had fallen in an ice cellar.\u201cFairy, stop struggling, and join the demons\u2026\u201dThe man\u2019s tone was like a cat catching a mouse, full of contempt and teasing.When his voice fell, Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s delicate skirt was instantly torn into pieces, and fell down like snowflakes falling. Her body was naked, her jade like cold skin exuded a bright white halo, oozing bursts of charming fragrance. Pure and flawless, yet extremely seductive.The man\u2019s eyes which were as dark as night, flashed scarlet, and his desire to conquer surged, his body exuded a kind of evil aura that was meant to destroy the world.Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s legs were bound by an invisible rope, making her akin to a poor little worm falling into a spider web.He pinched her chin and continued the interrupted assault with a more brutal posture. His cock quickly thrust into her flower hole, and Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s eyes burst into tears with pain.This is not the joy of fish and water at all, this is clearly a brutal killing!!!At this moment, Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s soul seemed to have left her body, she didn\u2019t feel the pain anymore, she looked at the scene in front of her like a bystander watching a show.\u201cHost\u2026\u201d Presumably afraid of her cursing, the system called out weakly.Ruan Jiaojiao did not care about it, she was really curious about this fantasy world.When she finished reading the received plot, her face turned cold.This was a world of Immortals and demons, the original owner of the body was an otherworldly and lofty person, but was unfortunately ridden with bad luck. How noble and glamorous she used to be, but her end was bleak and sad.Just because she loved the male lead, a God.This was the case in a Mary Sue world. Almost all the female characters had to admire the male protagonist and make trouble for the female lead.Therefore, her existence was to develop the plot. When the relationship between the male and female protagonist was almost ready, she can also receive lunch*. [TN: She can also receive lunch (\u9886\u4fbf\u5f53) \u2013 Is a slang for when actors are finished with their small job, they can take their boxed lunch and leave.]As for the current plot progress, she had obviously arrived late.The cold and ascetic male lead had treated the female lead differently, and she was punished by the second male lead, because she was set up by the female protagonist. The other party easily sealed her power and knocked her down like dust to the mortal world.The fairy fell into the hands of the leader of the demonic sect, and the demonic head\u2019s hatred of the immortal realm was all placed on the original owner of the body. After he tortured her in all manners, he brought her back to the Demonic Realm and threw her to a group of men to continue to ravage and ruin her.The devilish energy invaded her body, and the fairy completely fell into the devil\u2019s path and became blackened.She deliberately wanted to avenge the female lead, but during the battle between the demon and celestial beings, she was thrown out to block the knife by the demonic head and she realized that she who originated from the immortal world, had never been accepted by the Demonic World.She was traumatized physically and mentally, pushed to her last breath. The original owner harboured so much jealousy and hatred towards the cold-blooded demon lord and the female protagonist who was protected by the male lead and second male lead, and in the end, like a flower that wilted, she passed away, her soul scattering.\u2026Ruan Jiaojiao was brought back to the Demon Realm by the demonic lord Dong Fangshi. Just as he was about to order his subordinates to take her away, Ruan Jiaojiao knew she was doomed.So, she said to him.\u201cIf you let your men continue to insult me, you won\u2019t gain any greater pleasure, in fact, you have a better choice.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201dDong Fangshi\u2019s cold and evil eyes were cast toward her limp figure on the ground, showing some interest in her words.\u201cMy identity is of greater value. If I return to the immortal world, I can become your insider.\u201d Ruan Jiaojiao calmly negotiated with him.Dongfang Ji did not respond, as if he was weighing her words.Ruan Jiaojiao said again.\u201cI know you don\u2019t believe me; it doesn\u2019t matter. Anyway, you have many methods for controlling people in the Demon Realm, and you can use them over me.\u201dHer words seemed to warn Dongfang Ji. His eyes darkened, and the next moment, an irresistible force yanked her up and brought near him.Once again, he pinched her chin with his cold, slender fingers.\u201cYou want to betray the Immortal world? Why?\u201d He was puzzled by this point.After all, people in the Celestial World were all proud, and boasted themselves of being lofty and incompatible with their Demon Realm. Why would this woman take the initiative to get along with him? Wasn\u2019t she afraid of being punished by the Immortals?Ruan Jiaojiao sneered, her beautiful eyes were filled with hatred immediately.\u201cBecause I hate them more than you do. If it weren\u2019t for powers being sealed, how could I fall into your hands. It\u2019s because the other side was unkind first, so you can\u2019t blame me for not being righteous.\u201dDongfang Ji suddenly seemed to have taken interest in her, so Ruan Jiaojiao told him all about what happened to her.So that\u2019s what happened.Dongfang Ji patiently listened to her story.As expected of women, being jealous and fighting for the sake of a man and ignoring the overall situation was her weakness that he can benefit from.\u201cDo you like the God Qingshu?\u201dRuan Jiaojiao flashed a sarcastic smile.\u201cNo, he would rather like the little fairy maidservant who is useless than me. How can I be so stupid and like such a blind man.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s really stupid.\u201dDongfang Ji seemed to agree with her.Ruan Jiaojiao knew Dongfang Ji had suffered a great loss in the hands of God Qingshu, so he also said a few words about Qingshu, and she played along with him.\u201cI thought the demonic people would have unsightly appearances but when I see your lordship, I was captivated by your otherworldly bearing, particularly also because\u2026I have never experienced such a feeling of being sent to seventh heaven\u2026At this point, Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s fingers streaked across Dongfang Ji\u2019s chest, pressed her tender and soft body against him.\u201cI am willing to do my best for my lord, and when I get my revenge, I am willing to pledge allegiance and serve you, be it a slave or a concubine, I will not have any complaints.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Regardless, she had powers accompanying her as her very own golden finger.Anyway, one day in the Immortal Realm was a year in the mortal world, she was in no hurry to return.So when the celestial beings sent someone to catch her back, Ruan Jiaojiao had been playing happily in the mortal world for several years.\u201cRuan Jiaojiao, do you know your mistakes?\u201dShe was taken to the Heavenly Emperor, as she met the emperor\u2019s calm and majestic face, she immediately made a startled appearance.\u201cEmperor, I know I am wrong, I should not have secretly descended into the mortal world because of my playfulness. I am willing to be punished.\u201dGod Luo Ya on the side, had a strange look in his eyes.He originally thought the woman would instantly beseech justice, but he didn\u2019t expect that Ruan Jiaojiao would never mention the fact that she was sealed off of her powers and was thrown down to the mortal world.As a person who can give the female lead a hard time, Ruan Jiaojiao was naturally not a villain without background. She was the niece of the Empress, so the Emperor\u2019s attitude towards her confession to admit mistakes was quite satisfied. So this matter passed by and was over.After going back to her Xianju <sup>1</sup> TN: In Chinese, xian means \u201ccelestial spirit,\u201d and ju means \u201cdwelling place.\u201d Xianju was named \u201cdwelling place of celestial spirits\u201d due to its natural beauty. Xianju County ( Chinese: \u4ed9\u5c45\u53bf; pinyin: Xi\u0101nj\u016b Xi\u00e0n Tai-chow dialect: Sin-k\u00fc Y\u00f6n) is a county of Zhejiang, China. Source: Wikipedia Ruan Jiaojiao did not go out again and cleverly shut herself for several days, until the day of Heavenly Banquet of Immortals.&amp;nbsp;All the Celestial beings would attend this banquet. Ruan Jiaojiao rubbed her hands in excitement. She could soon see the male and female protagonist. After so many days of boredom,\u00a0 she finally had something to do.In fact, she wanted to see the male and female lead, however, she didn\u2019t know how many eyes wanted to view her.After all, amongst all the Immortals in the Heavens, she is one of the best in terms of appearance.The Emperor treated her nicely, except the Empress, who had the heart to criticize such a peerless beauty?But the most bizarre thing was, she looked so beautiful, yet the male lead and second male lead behaved like they were blindfolded and loved the female lead.When Ruan Jiaojiao got used to her own face, she was a little disappointed when she saw the female protagonist. Compared with her elegance and beauty, the female lead\u2019s appearance was too wan and pale.Perhaps the villain \u2013 leader of the Demonic Sect was not blind, and did not give into the Mary Sue halo of the female lead.After all, when they first met, the Demonic Head was so enthusiastic with her. With the indifferent attitude by the male lead and the second male lead, Ruan Jiaojiao had a little more affection for him.When the system heard Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s thoughts, it was already too tired to complain.Of course, there were many people who weren\u2019t blind. After all, she was a hard-to-come-by beauty and was shown favour by many men at the banquet.At the banquet of Immortals, everyone was surprised to find that their goddess who had always been cold and arrogant suddenly became kind, and she was considerate to everyone, especially when the other party treated her politely. She accepted it with a smile, which made all the Immortals present fascinated \u2013 regardless of men or women they turned dizzy.System: \u201cPlease pay attention to the impact you are leaving. Hey, you are a celestial being this time, not a fox demon!!!\u201dRuan Jiaojiao lazily supported her chin with her hand, as she raised the jade wine cup and drank, she found the wine of immortals\u2019 was really good to drink. She emptied her wine glass, and the person next to her immediately filled it for her. Seeing her cheeks turned pink and looked peach-like, her face became more and more alluring, making everything around her seem to be overshadowed by others. People could not help but feel their heart race.God Qingshu glanced over, his brows scrunching up inadvertently.He knew this woman liked him, and even hinted she wanted to be an Immortal couple with him. But his heart was still firm and refused her decisively. Later on, seeing how entangled she was with him, he just felt bored.Some time ago, he knew that she had a scrimmage with God Luo Ya and was knocked down to the mortal world.In fact, he was there at that time and saw it with his own eyes, but he didn\u2019t stop because he wanted to teach her a lesson.Just because he and Lan Xue said a few good words, showed some good feelings, she bullied Lan Xue, calling her a handmaid, and also framed her. Such a behaviour was truly disgusting.Thinking of this, Qingshu retracted his gaze and looked at Lan Xue who was sitting beside him, his eyes softened immediately.Lan Xue entered the Immortal Realm not long ago. She originally worked as a maidservant for the Emperor, and now he called her in his Immortal palace to deal with daily affairs.Lan Xue picked up the jug and poured a glass of wine for Qingshu, smiling sweetly at him, and tried to hide the sourness in her heart.There was a difference between superiority and inferiority.No matter how she was taken care of by God Qingshu, in the eyes of the other side, she was just a handmaid who could not stand on an equal footing like the woman with stunning beauty could. That woman\u2019s arrogant and contemptuous eyes made Lan Xue uncomfortable like needles piercing her heart.At the moment, Ruan Jiaojiao was like stars and moon in the banquet, and she had countless admirers, but she \u2013 Lan Xue was just an inconspicuous little maidservant.No! At least God Qingshu had never treated that woman differently, and God Luo Ya had even helped her and taught that woman a lesson.No matter how superior she behaved, how beautiful she looked, in the eyes of God Qingshu and God Luo Ya, it was nothing.Right!Thinking of this, Lan Xue seemed to have gained her confidence, her eyes bursting with dazzling brilliance, and she looked at Ruan Jiaojiao not to be outdone.Receiving the provocative gaze of the female lead, Ruan Jiaojiao secretly thought it was funny, she was really a small animal like a fox, pretending to be a tiger. It\u2019s amazing to have the male lead and second male lead as her backer!She also had the Empress and Demon Lord as her backer! Thinking of it, this can be considered as a chess game between black and white!Feeling amused, Ruan Jiaojiao picked up her drink, suddenly left her table and walked towards Luo Ya.\u201cWhat do you want?\u201dUnder everyone\u2019s eyes, Luo Ya, because of the Empress\u2019s face, didn\u2019t dare create a scene and asked in a low voice.Ruan Jiaojiao stared at Luo Ya\u2019s face which was not inferior to that of Qingshu, and couldn\u2019t help sticking out her tongue and licked her rosy lips.\u201cGod Luo Ya, please let us have a toast, are you not willing to give me face?\u201dLuo Ya didn\u2019t know what medicine the woman took. Actually, the two had nothing to do with each other, and there were no grievances at all.However, due to fate, he had a good impression of Lan Xue, and he had come upon her eyes which were red and looked pitiful. He used the method of celestial beings to find out that Lan Xue was bullied by this woman, so he took action to discipline her.But later, this woman was taken to Heavenly Court on charges of privately acting in the lower realm, however she didn\u2019t blame him, which Luo Ya found a little strange.He originally thought she was a woman who was eager to compete and gain attention.It didn\u2019t take long for God Luo Ya to discover that this woman really loved to hold grudges, and had been holding back a big move to retaliate against him!When Luo Ya regained consciousness, he found something was wrong.He was actually in a dark and damp cave, and his body was soaked in a thousand-year-old pool. He immediately casted a spell, only to find his spiritual power was sealed and his body could not move.Luo Ya\u2019s complexion remained unchanged, but his heart was shocked.His body without using spells was suffering an attack from the biting cold. As a God, Luo Ya never had such a bad experience after turning into an Immortal.At this time, his back was covered with a warm and soft body, and it gently wrapped around him.\u201cGod Luo Ya, how does it feel to be powerless?\u201d The woman\u2019s voice was soft, crisp and pleasant, echoing in the cave.\u201cWhat did you do to me?\u201dLuo Ya asked coldly.As soon as the woman spoke, he immediately realised the identity of the other person.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I just added a little something into the wine while your heavenly lord was not paying attention, and then sealed your spiritual powers with the magic weapon given to me by the Empress.\u201d Ruan Jiaojiao did not hide what she had done.\u201cAs a celestial being, you actually resort to such despicable means.\u201d He angrily denounced her.Ruan Jiaojiao refused to accept his righteousness, and sneered.\u201cHow can I beat God Luo Ya without using these methods?\u201d Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s tone revealed a hint of haughtiness.With the sound of water 'splashing\u201d, Luo Ya felt that the delicate body behind his back suddenly disappeared. The conversation just now seemed to be an illusion, and he couldn\u2019t sense the existence of the woman.Just when his limbs were unbearably permeated by the bone-chilling cold, she abruptly appeared in front of him again, raised her lips and smiled at Luo Ya, her warm body twisted around him from the front like a snake.\u201cWhat the hell do you want to do?!\u201d Luo Ya asked with irritation.\u201cI want to humiliate you!\u201d Ruan Jiaojiao replied rather simply.She was right in front of him at the moment. There was a crack in the cave, and you could see a bright crescent moon and twinkling stars shining above her head, shedding white brilliance like a layer of silver-powdered halo covering all the surrounding scenery, the Immortal Realm did not have such a view.Luo Ya realised, the two of them were in the mortal world.\u201cGod Luo Ya, one day in heaven, is equivalent to one year on earth, even if you are here for ten days or half a month getting tortured by me, it will only be a flick of finger\u2019s time in the Immortal Realm.\u201dRuan Jiaojiao\u2019s malicious voice sounded in his ears.Luo Ya only felt gloominess spiralling in his chest, this cunning and sinister woman!!!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He had never expected that this woman, as an Immortal, would actually lay hands on him.He, a God, Luo Ya was actually molested!Damn it!His heart was frustrated, and he tried hard to drive his spiritual power in his body to break through the barrier, and there was a thin layer of sweat on his forehead, but he still couldn\u2019t break free from the restriction she placed over him.\u201cDon\u2019t bother to struggle God Luo Ya, this weapon is given to me by the Empress.\u201d Ruan Jiaojiao said triumphantly, showing off.Luo Ya threatened coldly.\u201cIf the Empress knew that you would do such a thing to a God, do you think it would bear good fruit?\u201d\u201cOh, I am so scared\u2026\u201dRuan Jiaojiao exaggeratedly said, but her hands were still clung over Luo Ya\u2019s shoulders. Most of her body was attached to Luo Ya, and said with a smile.\u201cSo I have to do very bad things to this God, and make God Luo Ya feel ashamed to speak up to outsiders, so that no one will know, and the Emperor and the Empress will not punish me.Luo Yah heard the determination and certainly in her words, and suddenly had a bad feeling, the two of them were too close and intimate.\u201cYou\u2026\u201dBefore he could say anything further, his thin lips were blocked by warm and soft lips.Luo Ya could hardly believe it, it was difficult to associate the frivolous and fatuous woman in front of him with the proud and arrogant Immortal.\u201cAren\u2019t you being crazy?\u201dThe kiss ended quickly, and Luo Ya asked as soon as it was over.If an Immortal\u2019s temperament changed drastically in a short period, it was very likely that the person\u2019s body had been possessed by a demon.\u201cWell, I\u2019m fascinated by the heroic demeanour of this God, when you knocked me off, you made me feel so painful\u2026\u201dRuan Jiaojiao said vaguely in a soft tone, her lips lightly and gently bit his earlobe and licked Luo Ya\u2019s ear with her soft and wet tongue.With a \u201cboom\u201d, Luo Ya felt his head burst.\u201cPresumptuous!\u201dAfter a long while, he squeezed out these two words <sup>1</sup> Two words in Chinese, but translated to one in English. , but the woman Ruan Jiaojiao climbed on his solid and firm arm, grabbed his hand to pull her top on her left side, exposing her delicate milk white skin, as she teased him by whispering in a provocative and ambiguous tone.\u201cGod Luo Ya, I want you to be just a little bit unbridled towards me, you touch my chest, do you feel my heart thumping\u2026\u201dThe whole person seemed to be frozen, like a sculpture, Ruan Jiaojiao grinned, and started doing whatever she wanted to.Her hand unscrupulously grabbed the bulge in between his legs and kneaded it in her hand.\u201cGod Luo Ya, you have been a bachelor in the Immortal Realm for thousands of years. This person has been lonely for a long time, and his temper is so bad. If you don\u2019t agree, you will really knock him out of the world. You truly don\u2019t know how to pity and cherish your jade. Now I will teach you what a man should do.\u201dRuan Jiaojiao had long been impatient for talking nonsense with him. Seeing that he had seemingly given up, and was doing nothing to resist, she stretched out her hand and stripped his robe.The man\u2019s upper body was naked, revealing his perfect pectoral muscles, and his strong physique. Luo Ya\u2019s lower body was soaked in the water, thus Ruan Jiaojiao couldn\u2019t see it clearly, but she had touched it just then, and the size was quite impressive, however his lust did not seem to be provoked by her. The place between his legs was dormant, not hard.Challenging! She liked it!Ruan Jiaojiao was ready to go all out, Lan Xue pretends to be innocent, right? She wanted to see who would have the last laugh at the end.The fire ignited in her eyes, Ruan Jiaojiao was incited by Luo Ya\u2019s behaviour to conquer. She gently fiddled with her fingers in the pool. Soon, the ice-cold pool water vaporized dazzling white mist. In the blink of an eye, it became a pool of hot spring water.Luo Ya closed his eyes, like an old monk entering meditation, and shielded his five senses, do not see, do not listen, the heart would not be confused. But the hands that wandered back and forth on his body, as well as her lips and teeth on his chest which got licked and bitten again and again, caused a fine tingling numbness and itched.\u201cCut it out\u2026\u201dEven though he had erected a solid spiritual barrier, he still heard a woman\u2019s sneer, which was full of mockery. Luo Ya couldn\u2019t help but be annoyed, opened his eyes, and stared at her.\u201cNot pretending to be dead?\u201d Ruan Jiaojiao with her delicate and slender fingers pinched Luo Ya\u2019s chin playfully and contemptuously, like a brothel client treating a prostitute who sells their body.For a while, God Luo Ya only felt a burst of angry flames in his chest, which made him want to skin her alive.But this woman\u2019s next action \u2013 in front of his face and sharp-like-a-knife eyes, she undressed and stripped off the Immortal robes, exposing a creamy and smooth look. Her skin, under the sultry moonlight, exuded a warm pearl-like brilliance.Luo Ya only felt his breathing was stagnant, and his cheeks could not control the upsurge of heat.\u201cShameless!\u201d He rebuked, but his voice was inexplicably weak.\u201cYes, before God Luo Ya, I have no face to speak of.\u201dRuan Jiaojiao\u2019s delicate body covered Luo Ya\u2019s body, wrapping him like a snake, her legs hooked to his waist, because of her movements, the clear water splashed all over, and she deliberately rubbed against him, as he became bigger and bigger.Until then, Luo Ya could still bear it, but Ruan Jiaojiao did not give him an opportunity to block his five senses again. She climbed up along his waist, and her legs slid up against either side of him, her arms pressed down onto him with most of her weight on him.As the two of them were in water, Ruan Jiaojiao flexibly climbed up Luo Ya who was sitting crossed-legged with ease, and then forcefully wrapped her hands around his neck.\u201cGod Luo Ya\u2026\u201dShe called out softly, and Luo Ya\u2019s handsome face at that time just happened to be sandwiched in the middle of her cleavage, pressed by beautifully shaped snow cream balls.Luo Ya\u2019s face was green, but his nose could smell the enchanting fragrance of her body, as long as his line of sight slightly turned, he could clearly see her towering pair of snow white and soft flesh, as well as her gorgeous red tops like that of a flower, as if tempting him to have a taste.Just as Luo Ya was experiencing an unprecedented battle between heaven and man, he suddenly heard a woman\u2019s arrogant and inciting voice above his head.\u201cAre you convinced?!\u201dRuan Jiaojiao thought, if she had a whip in her hand, how great it would have been.Humph! I want you to kneel down and sing my praises!This woman!!!Luo Ya was bullied by a woman, an inexplicable sense of irritation caused his blood to surge, and the spiritual power in his body rioted like a bloodthirsty sword out of its sheath, and instantly broke free from the shackles of the weapon.Ruan Jiaojiao was stunned for a moment, and in an instant she felt that the world was spinning, she was overturned by Luo Ya.With a 'splash\u201d, the huge fall stirred up a wave, and Ruan Jiaojiao was thrown into the water by Luo Ya.Plop Plop\u2026She drank several sips of water unsuspectingly, and then she was dragged out of the water by him.Fuck! What kind of broken magical weapon is this, which cannot even stop him?Ruan Jiaojiao was frightened by Luo Ya who was in rage, her hands and legs trembled wildly.But in the blink of an eye, the situation between the two was reversed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

System! Help me!\u201dBecause Ruan Jiaojiao couldn\u2019t get up as every inch of her skin was slippery, Luo Ya could only grasp her arms with both his hands and lift her up.Facing Luo Ya whose eyes were full of evil spirits, Ruan Jiaojiao swallowed and pulled on an awkward smile.Luo Ya furrowed his eyebrows, and his extraordinarily handsome face was cold. Ruan Jiaojiao had no intention of admiring the beautiful man, as her life was pinched in the other\u2019s hands.Luo Ya squinted at her, his two elegant eyes stared at her small ones. After a while, Ruan Jiaojiao stretched out her finger and tentatively poked Luo Ya\u2019s chest.\u201cGo-God\u2026\u201dWhat she didn\u2019t know was that although Luo Ya looked fierce on the surface, in fact, she had just forcibly broken through his spell barrier, and as she was grabbed tightly, she did not fall down.Thinking about it, how could the magic weapon given by the Empress be easy to mess with and be tattered.Ruan Jiaojiao quietly curled her lips when she heard the system\u2019s words, and smiled meaningfully.She covered Luo Ya\u2019s chest with her fingers, as her nails forcefully pinched Luo Ya\u2019s red small grain.Luo Ya eyes flicked a touch of hostility, wanting to punish this shameless woman severely, but his body\u2019s strength was at the end of his control, his thin lips were pressed tightly, Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s hand pushed him, and Luo Ya fell into the pool once again with a thud, which stirred up huge waves in the water.Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s figure was as graceful as ever, the moment he fell into the water, she wrapped her arms around his neck, her red lips covered his cold thin ones, and the tip of her tongue drilled into his mouth like a flexible slithering snake, which entangled him wantonly,\u00a0 played and wandered around in his mouth.Ruan Jiaojiao snapped her fingers, causing the two of them to fall into the bottom of the pool, but at the same time there was an invisible semi-circular barrier which separated them from the water. Although they were at the of the pool, they were not submerged by the water, and the barrier exuded a bright white light, quietly illuminating the original dark and deepest part of the bottom of the pool.\u201cGod Luo Ya, there are only the two of us here, and no one will come to rescue you.\u201dShe made Luo Ya lay down, as Ruan Jiaojiao sat on him, her attitude arrogant and domineering accompanied with her bullying posture.She frivolously squeezed Luo Ya\u2019s chin once again, and touched his jade-like shiny face with her fingers. She leaned down slightly, and the tip of her nose almost touched his.Luo Ya held back the bloody air surging through his lungs and looked at her with his sharp eyes that couldn\u2019t wait to tear her apart, but Luo Ya\u2019s breath was filled with the refreshing fragrance of her body.At such a close sight, her face was still so beautiful that it was almost impossible to ignore.Ruan Jiaojiao leaned in front of Luo Ya, as she appreciated and was almost captivated by his face, she turned her waist, instead of facing him, she turned her back to him.Luo Ya\u2019s body was fixed and unable to move, her back curves were visible unobstructed to his view, her fine waist narrow and beautiful buttocks like a ripe peach.\u201cI am offered a toast, so why shall I not drink the fine wine.\u201dRuan Jiaojiao spitted out, Luo Ya\u2019s nerves tensed immediately, although he could not see what she was doing, he felt his penis being held by a warm and soft little hand.She\u2026 What the hell is she planning to do?!Luo Ya was stunned, as he saw her bend down, the snow-white buttocks filled his field of vision.He only felt that his genitals were wrapped in a warm and moist object, also being accompanied by a force of being sucked tightly, an experience he had never had before, an electric tingling sensation wandered from his lower abdomen towards his heavenly spirit, Lup Ya\u2019s blood was boiling. There was a voice roaring in his sea of consciousness.So cool! So cool!But the next moment, Luo Ya felt another sharp tingling, which made his whole body tremble.Is she trying to bite him off?!Realizing this, Luo Ya urged all the remaining spiritual power in his body, once again broke through the spell holding him back, and suddenly sat up, grabbed and twisted the wanton woman who wanted to make trouble.\u201cYou!\u201dWhen he saw what she was holding in her hand, Luo Ya\u2019s complexion became stiff, and he felt the blood all over in his body condensed.\u201cWhat?\u201d Ruan Jiaojiao gave a sly smirk and shook the tail of the beast she was holding in her hand.The spirit beast was fluffy and white, looking three-part like a fox and four-part like a dog. At this time, there was a little turbidity on its small mouth, and crystal saliva was dripping down its chin.The black and glass-like clear eyes of the spirit beast met Luo Ya\u2019s eyes, and Luo Ya felt his scalp turn numb. There was a burst of anger in his chest, so much so that he wanted to destroy the sky, however he had no spiritual power to be able to make use of.Ruan Jiaojiao stretched out her fingers and rubbed the small head of the spirit beast, holding it in the palm of her hand.\u201cIt is grateful to God, because of God Luo Ya\u2019s gift, it can now cultivate to achieve its transformation for at least two hundred years less.\u201dRuan Jiaojiao kept down the spirit beast, it was like a snowball, as it slid and ran away.Luo Ya naturally would not be struggling with an uncivilized animal, his eyes were gloomy, staring at Ruan Jiaojiao.\u201cDon\u2019t be stingy, God Luo Ya, that spirit beast is a pet that I keep, and if God Luo Ya waters it, it is equivalent to giving it to me.\u201dRuan Jiaojiao rubbed over, grabbed Luo Ya\u2019s neck, and exhaled at him softly.\u201cDoes this God wish it was me instead?\u201dShe stretched out the tip of her tongue and licked the corner of Luo Ya\u2019s lips. The soft and wet tip caused some tingling itch, which made the tip of Luo Ya\u2019s heart tremble uncontrollably.Ruan Jiaojiao no longer spoke, her soft body entangled Luo Ya like a vine, and a pair of soft snow-white round globes rubbed back and forth on his naked chest, with her legs straddling between his legs.This time, she quickly noticed that a hard, hot object poked between her hips.Ruan Jiaojiao felt it, and so did Luo Ya.In fact, he tried to restrain himself, and tried hard not to groan, but his meat stick could not be controlled by him at all, and was charmed by this woman.He is a God, and has cultivated for thousands of years, he had long been able to gain control over his even emotions and six desires without being attracted by foreign objects, however he was affected by this woman which stirred his six roots.Luo Ya sighed, which was filled with frustration.Ruan Jiaojiao smiled slightly, she no longer hesitated, as soon as her buttocks were lifted, she sunk down her waist and swallowed Luo Ya\u2019s pillar of optimum into her acupoint little by little.\u201cGod Luo Ya, I am really fucking you now!\u201dRuan Jiaojiao smiled lightly once again as she said this. Luo Ya could not think about what to say. At that moment, all his mind was concentrated on was the thing taking his crotch in, as he watched. His thick penis was eaten into her flower hole by this woman, and when he inserted it deep into her hole, it immediately gave him an indescribable sense of experience.His purple-red and blue-stringed meat stick invaded her pink honey valley, and the two of them were completely intertwined. Ruan Jiaojiao put her arms around his neck, bit her lips and closed her eyes. Obviously, she also felt that the passage could not be entered smoothly. But she sat down harshly, and began to shake her waist to increase the friction between them. The tingling sensation went straight through their heavenly spirit from the tail vertebrae. Luo Ya\u2019s\u00a0 solid barrier of consciousness was instantly broken, with double stimulation of vision and touch, his reason and morals were thrown out of his mind, and his heart, soul and body were shocked, as he trembled involuntarily.Luo Ya did not hold on for long, he threw his helmet and armour, shivered, and then vented the built up stress out of his body. His consciousness appeared in a trance, as if wandering in the sky, unspeakably comfortable, he felt that the trauma of his body seemed to be healed a bit.It was not an illusion, it was because of the benefits brought by dual cultivation.Luo Ya couldn\u2019t express what he felt in his heart. He should hate the poisonous and shameless woman who dared to be bold and make a move against him, however the two of them had just done such an intimate thing, moreover he felt another strange feeling for her.Some were ambiguous, some were weird.Ruan Jiaojiao and Luo Ya were the same kind, both of them were Immortals. Naturally, she felt completely different from the last time she was forced and bullied by the Demon Lord. It was as if there was warm current flowing through her limbs, she felt that her body was light and floating like wandering between the clouds, an ethereal feeling.She reminisced about her feelings, and as she was deep in her endless thoughts, she was suddenly pinched on her chin by Luo Ya. She sensed that his spiritual power seemed to have recovered, but her heart did not get flustered and panicked, and was instead leisurely calm.\u201cGod Luo Ya, one day of being husband and wife is a grace that lasts for a lifetime, although we have not formed a bond of immortal couple, at any point, we will have a marriage. You should not be as cold-blooded and ruthless as you were last time.\u201dLuo Ya\u2019s heart was a mess, and his thoughts were complicated. He had mixed feelings like never before.However he casted aside these tangled thoughts, only one idea was too strong to be restrained.Luo Ya squeezed her chin, pushed her down and under his body in the blink of an eye, and then he lowered his head and kissed her pink lips.Ruan Jiaojiao was stunned for a moment, and then came back to her senses, and Lou Ya could not wait to separate her legs and send his hot cock into her wet cunt again. This time he did not need her to take the initiative, he did it quickly and vigorously. Pumping and thrusting, like a hungry wolf who saw meat, gobbling up and finishing her.Ah! This man!Ruan Jiaojiao ridiculed him in her heart, but when the waves of tingling pleasure came one after another, she intervened in Luo Ya\u2019s fierce offense again and again.The two of them had forgotten their previous sorrows and grievances, and they were completely devoted themselves to this hearty conversation between cloud and rain, not knowing what day was today.The days and three nights.Ruan Jiaojiao floated in the water, her long hair like a black waterfall drifted beside her, making her appear white as snow, and her red lips were beautiful and were dripping which made them look delicate, her face was like a moonlight, that could charm anyone.She was clearly not a demon, but an Immortal, however she was full of demonic charms, which made the man want to drain every drop of blood in her body.The man\u2019s sturdy body covered hers, and the two bodies were still intimately intertwined.Luo Ya held Ruan Jiaojiao tightly in his arms, his dark and indifferent eyes at this time were filled with tenderness like water, his thin and ruthless lips at this time were sucking and swallowing the red cherry blossom like grain at one side. The red cherry was as if a rare delicacy, his handsome face full of pleasure brought by lust.And the behemoth with hideous eyes under his crotch was coming in and out of the seductive honey valley between her legs.Water splashing, clouds and mist forming, the two let the sun rise and set, and the stars continued to move, tirelessly lingering around.Ruan Jiaojiao thought to herself that being an Immortal is good, they did not get tired, and they don\u2019t need to eat, drink and sleep. They could clean and freshen up with a single spell when they are dirty, so this was the longest sex she had ever had.It is truly unprecedented, and only a fantasy world such as this can she be able to enjoy such an unscientific sex.\u201cEnough!\u201dRuan Jiaojiao pushed aside Luo Ya\u2019s face in disgust. The man\u2019s handsome face turned black, but he still stretched out his long hands and took her back into his arms.\u201cYou motherfucker, stop!\u201dRuan Jiaojiao wanted to kick him away, but Luo Ya pulled her ankle and pressed her under him again.His spiritual powers were completely restored, and he easily used a spell to fix Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s body to suppress her resistance. He grabbed her legs and wrapped it around his waist, holding his erected cock and pierced her again. In her flower hole, he continued to drill into her acupoint endlessly.Luo Ya did not want to let her go at all, he was completely obsessed with the foreign pleasure her body brought him. And could not help but indulge himself.He was addicted to her.Or rather, he became crazy.Ruan Jiaojiao was depressed. She clearly wanted to humiliate him, but the result was that he was obviously too happy. This was really a loss!What an annoying man!!!TLers Note: (You might have already read this note at PD &amp; BB\u2019s bonus Kofi update)Hwello again, you all can skip this note if you want to ><, this is just system rabbling about her feelings.

Having returned to the Immortal Realm, she thought he was over with her, only to find him wagging his tail towards her.That Luo Ya was simply incomprehensible, she was fierce with him and suffered, she begged for mercy but she still suffered, she was indifferent and ignorant, even more so, she suffered by him.This tens of thousands of years old virgin was really terrible!Ruan Jiaojiao finally got rid of Luo Ya\u2019s entanglement, and ran to ask the Empress for a magic weapon.In the last world she learned an undeniable truth, to be strong, fists should be hard enough.So, everyone in the Immortal Realm were stunned as they saw how Ruan Jiaojiao beat God Luo Ya, he didn\u2019t show any annoyance, and also did not fight back.What else could this be, it must be because of love!The news that God Luo Ya admired Goddess Ruan Jiaojiao but was disliked spread wildly. The melon-eating audience in the Immortal Realm were also very gossipy. It did not take long for the Gods in the East and South of China to know.When Ruan Jiaojiao was chased around by Luo Ya and fled, the system suddenly asked.\u201cHost, do you remember the mission in this world?\u201d\u201cNonsense! This old lady is not mentally retarded!\u201dRuan Jiaojiao was angry.\u201cYou ran like you were a mouse getting chased by a cat, and not far away is God Qingshu.\u201d The system said faintly.Ruan Jiaojiao was stunned and was filled with fury immediately.\u201cGarbage system, why didn\u2019t you say it earlier!\u201dGod Qingshu saw the woman who had deliberately avoided him just now, rushing towards him.Uh\u2026The atmosphere was a bit awkward because of the silence between the two of them.Ruan Jiaojiao was burdened with the task of seducing God Qingshu, but their first meeting was so sudden, she had not thought about what to say to him.To say that this Immortal is no different from other human beings, the original owner loved him, but he was still unwilling to let go of his grudges. Even though the lesson has been tragic enough, the original owner was still obsessed with being favoured by God Qingshu.\u201cDo you need something?\u201d Qingshu looked cold, still the same indifferent God in her memory.Ruan Jiaojiao thought, and spoke.\u201cGod Qingshu, I heard that the mortal world is not peaceful these days. The evil spirits and demons are looting the people, causing their lives to turn into ashes, and corpses are everywhere. When I was in the mortal world, I received many favours from the mortals, and I want to repay them.\u201d\u201cSo?\u201d Qingshu replied, his face still expressionless.Ruan Jiaojiao was not the original owner, she had no affection for the male lead, and because of his indifference would not feel hurt.She curled her lips, and looked at him, her beautiful smile felt as if the spring flowers were to bloom, the earth would rejuvenate, and would break through thousand years old ice.However, God Qingshu\u2019s eyes were calm and not shaken by her beauty.\u201cI want to go down to earth and kill demons together with God Qingshu.\u201d She put away her smile, her determined eyes revealed a chill of killing.God Qingshu was taken aback, he had never seen this side of her, it seemed to be serious.But after all, as a female, what could she do?That\u2019s right, God Qingshu was essentially a machismo.The female protagonist caters to the likings of God Qingshu. She exists like a dodder flower. She\u2019s like a soft, sweet and pure white orchid. If it is to be raised in a greenhouse, it can only rely on its owner\u2019s strength to exist.In fact, no matter what the original owner did, she could not get the heart of God Qingshu, because the original owner\u2019s beauty and background were far better than the female lead, and could not arouse the male lead\u2019s desire to protect and be compulsive towards her.\u201cSo, what are you planning to do by doing this host?\u201d The system asked.Ruan Jiaojiao pursed her lips into an evil smile, squinted her eyes dangerously, and said casually.\u201cI am going to tear his pride and arrogance in pieces, push him deep into the abyss and struggle, and rub his torn pride and self-esteem on the ground.\u201dIt sounded terrible, and the system silently offered incense sticks for the male lead.When God Luo Ya was searching for Ruan Jiaojiao and couldn\u2019t find her, he heard that she volunteered and went down to the mortal world to ward off demons and defend the people together with God Qingshu.The Heavenly Emperor and the Empress were relieved with the protection of God Qingshu over Ruan Jiaojiao, as she went together with him.But no one knew that soon after the two went to the mortal realm, their whereabouts were unknown.Only the soul lamps that belonged to the two lives were still gleaming in the Hall of Changming <sup>1</sup> TN: A place where soul lamps were kept , indicating the two were still alive.God Qingshu didn\u2019t expect that he would encounter an ambush by the Demon Lord when they arrived in the mortal world. The other side had an extremely powerful magic weapon, which bound his spiritual powers and he couldn\u2019t use them.At the critical moment, Ruan Jiaojiao stepped up to meet the enemy, and fought a battle with the Demon Lord in the sky, the two people tangled together.After a long while, Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s dumb and forbearing voice came from a distance, one could hear her condition was not good.\u201cGod Qingshu, I will try to stop him, you go!\u201dThe Demon Lord\u2019s sarcasm filled voice could also be heard.\u201cThe dignified God Qingshu even let\u2019s a woman protect himself, and hides behind her, shrinking his head and tail. If this spreads out, people will laugh at it for generations.\u201dHearing this, God Qingshu was full of anger, but no matter how he urged his spiritual power to move, he could not get rid of the restriction placed over him.With a \u201cbang\u201d, a snow-white figure fell from the sky.Ruan Jiaojiao fell to the ground like a bird with injured wings. She covered her chest and spit out a mouthful of red blood, which dyed her white immortal\u2019s robe red.Ruan Jiaojiao was seriously injured, but she still guarded Qingshu like a barrier, trying to block Demon Lord\u2019s approach.The Demon sneered, and the black cloak he wore floated in the air like a huge net covering the two Immortals. The dense fog filled Qingshu\u2019s line of sight, and the cold air penetrated into his bone marrow and then into his limbs.As soon as Qingshu\u2019s spiritual consciousness was extinguished, he fainted.When he woke up, Qingshu found himself locked in a dark water prison, this was the Demon Realm.His hands were fastened to the wall by a chain made of thousand-year-old barbed iron. He once again tried to mobilize the spiritual powers in his body, but to no avail did it work.\u201cGod Qingshu, are you awake?\u201dThere was a weak female voice heard which came from the ground.He casted his sight over and saw Ruan Jiaojiao, whose looks could be described as embarrassed and haggard. The original spotless immortal robes were stained with blood and had turned into a dark red colour. The hem of her clothes was stained with black soil, with her face still white. Her hair was messy, but this could not hide her gorgeous appearance.She was clearly in such a terrible environment, but she still looked so devastatingly beautiful.God Qingshu was lost for a moment. He must admit that she was really beautiful, however her appearance was offensive, which made him subconsciously alienate and be indifferent towards her.Then the previous scene of her fighting the Demon Lord appeared in his mind, and God Qingshu suddenly realised that women are not only moving for their pitiful and weak features.But in the present situation, the two fell into the Demonic Leader\u2019s hands, he was afraid there would be more misfortunes than good deeds.His failure to protect her raised a deep sense of guilt in Qingshu\u2019s heart.Ruan Jiaojiao got up from the ground with difficulty and stood in front of him. She then stretched out her hand and pressed it on Qingshu\u2019s chest.He had never been in such close contact with a woman before, Qingshu was taken aback, but before he could react, the warm touch had already been evacuated. He was still cold all over his body, so when he felt a little bit of warmth by Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s warm hand and was taken back, he was reluctant to let go.\u201cGod Qingshu, what should we do now?\u201d Ruan Jiaojiao asked him with a calm tone.Qingshu once again looked at her with admiration. She was not depressed nor panicked. Even before he woke up, he could not imagine how she faced such a sinister and dangerous environment alone.However, he disappointed her.He had never encountered such a situation before, thus he did not know what they should do.Ruan Jiaojiao seemed to see his embarrassment and did not ask any more questions, but lowered her eyes, as if thinking about something.\u201cGod Qingshu, I have a way, but I may have to wrong you a bit.\u201dTLers Note:It\u2019s system again!

    "Chapter 76": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Being PAPA\u2019d Every Time I TransmigrateChapter 74 [4th World 6] Get it done withPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTitle: Being PAPA\u2019d Every Time I TransmigrateTranslator: System YaoiArc 4: The Celestial Who Fell Down to EarthChapter 6: Get it done withWhat?Qingshu was about to ask, when he saw the woman standing in front of him with thin eyebrows, suddenly raising her hand, and with one move her robes slipped to the ground.She actually stood naked in front of him with an inch of her body covered.Really shameless!!!Qingshu was about to sternly reprimand her and lash out, but his face was held in her warm hands, and she looked up at him sincerely.\u201cGod Qingshu\u2019s spiritual power is sealed, and I am weak. God Qingshu\u2026now we are trapped here. I don\u2019t know if the reinforcements will come or even if they do, when will they come. Instead of waiting hopelessly, it is better to save yourself. I don\u2019t want to be demonized. I don\u2019t want to be humiliated by the demons; I don\u2019t want us to die here!\u201dBecause of her words, Qingshu swallowed back his original harsh words, instead asking coldly.\u201cThen what is your solution?\u201dRuan Jiaojiao said softly.\u201cDual cultivation.\u201dQingshu was stunned, and instantly understood what Ruan Jiaojiao meant.The method of immortal dual cultivation had many benefits, and with how they could not escape from the Demon Realm at all in their current situation, dual cultivation can help to quickly increase their spiritual power, and they may be able to find a glimmer of hope.It seemed there was only this way to give medicine to a dead horse <sup>1</sup> TN: to give medicine to a dead horse is a Chinese idiom which means to keep trying everything in a desperate situation .Ruan Jiaojiao stretched out her hand to cover Qingshu\u2019s eyes.\u201cDon\u2019t look at me, God Qingshu, you have been wronged.\u201dHer voice was suppressed, extremely low, as if she had bitten her lips in shame and squeezed out those words.Qingshu wanted to say that she was obviously wronging herself. She was an Immortal admired by many people. A blood relative of the Empress had fallen into such a horrible situation, and she had to commit herself to him so hastily for the sake of a ray of life.Ruan Jiaojiao let go of her hand that covered Qingshu, his eyes closed tightly, it seems that he listened to her and had blocked his vision.She quietly cocked the corner of her mouth, and reached out to untie his robe.Qingshu could not see anything, thus the feeling that those little hands which were groping around his waist became clearer, and his body trembled slightly, unable to restrain his reaction.Ruan Jiaojiao took the opportunity to smear some oil and tossed around for a while before she untied the robe strap, and then she put one hand on the thing between Qingshu\u2019s legs.Because she knew exactly what was going to happen to the two of them, Ruan Jiaojiao was prepared by herself just then. Qingshu\u2019s penis vaguely raised his head. Ruan Jiaojiao was a bit regretful. But if Qingshu could not stand up, she could still do it. She could use the trick which was used to deal with Luo Ya and let her little pet entertain him well.That\u2019s it.She took off his pants, completely exposing his genitals, Ruan Jiao squeezed her petite hands together.It was huge! Sure enough, he was the male lead of this fantasy world, this kind of size was unusual!The moment she touched his cock, the thing seemed to shiver shyly, but it swelled a bit in her hand, Ruan Jiaojiao couldn\u2019t help but let out an exclamation.Although her voice was very low, Qing Shu\u2019s ears were dyed scarlet.He was trying to warn himself that this was just a choice out of desperation, the two were only doing this to improve the spiritual power with dual cultivation, without mixing any feelings in it.But when the woman\u2019s warm body came over and the two soft lumps of flesh touched him fully, Qingshu\u2019s mind went completely empty, and the scene he had just seen flashed in his mind.She had undressed in front of him, revealing her seductive snow-white body.Qingshu seemed to have opened his heavenly eyes. He had clearly closed them, but he could seemingly watch every movement of hers.She did not hesitate, her warm tender body pressed against him, one arm hooked his neck, and she stood on her tiptoes, lifted one leg, and then held his meat stick and pointed it at the flower hole between her legs to slowly feed it in.\u201cWell\u2026\u201dHe did not know who made the sigh, but Qingshu felt his heart trembling, feeling that he was wrapped in an incredibly warm and comfortable blanket, like countless small mouths sucking in the cock and caressing him. He greedily tightened his cock and sent it deeper, until it reached the end of her flower hole, it was difficult to move every inch\u2026Ruan Jiaojiao began to pump her body, swinging her waist, and both of their crotches bumped together with every thrust.Such sensory stimulation brought an unspeakable experience to the abstinent God Qingshu. He felt that every muscle in his body was taut, and every pore in his body seemed to have exploded. The tingling pleasure surged up their bodies one after another, as if an illusion. Everything around him calmed down, he could only hear his own rapid breathing and his body\u2019s clamouring longing.Not enough! Not enough! This pace was too slow! He wanted to seize the initiative, wanted to press her soft body under him, and pound into her fiercely!Ruan Jiaojiao looked at Qingshu, admiring the usual high and indifferent face that was full of eroticism and almost out of control at this time. She evoked a smirk, suddenly stopped her movement, stepped back, and because of their separation her cunt twitched.Qingshu forgot the promise he had made, and suddenly opened his eyes because of the sudden stop. His cold black eyes were full of desire and dissatisfaction at this time.Ruan Jiaojiao showed shyness on her face, bit her lips embarrassedly, crossed her arms to block his sight which was on her chest, took a step back and shook her head.\u201cI-I cannot do it\u2026\u201dShe hesitated, and her beautiful eyes suddenly became dark and complicated.He knew that this method was proposed by her in the first place, and if she didn\u2019t want to do it with him, there was no need to force her.But\u2026but\u2026 there was a beast in his body that seemed to be roaring like crazy\u2026 he wanted to keep doing it with her!!!\u201cCome here.\u201d Qingshu\u2019s expression was indistinct, as he spit out the words.Ruan Jiaojiao seemed to be against him deliberately, she took a step back and created some distance between the two of them.\u201cNo! I\u2026I\u2026\u201d\u201cCome here!\u201dQingshu\u2019s tone had already turned cold and harsh, and his eyes became sharp as a knife.Ruan Jiaojiao looked away and looked towards a corner as if she didn\u2019t know what he meant.\u201cGod Qingshu, let\u2019s think of another way.\u201dQingshu never had such a contradiction, he wanted to yell and curse, but at the same time he wanted to catch her and have her on the spot.Ruan Jiaojiao turned her head, she unconsciously stared at the upright beast under Qingshu\u2019s crotch, with crystal clear water still on it.Following her sight, Qingshu also noticed his swollen fleshy organ. He wanted to poke the thing into her small and wet hole madly.Maybe he was too fierce and scared her.Qingshu secretly thought.So Ruan Jiaojiao watched Qingshu\u2019s complexion soften, like a hungry wolf who was good at coaxing a little white rabbit, and whispered to her wearing sheep\u2019s clothing.\u201cYou come here, we almost succeeded, get it done with it for now and let it pass. Don\u2019t fall short, okay?\u201dRuan Jiaojiao pursed her lips. After a while, she seemed to have made up her mind and finally approached him again.Qing Shu breathed a sigh in relief and immediately continued his efforts.\u201cWrap your legs around my waist, I\u2019ll move.\u201dRuan Jiaojiao obediently wrapped her legs around his waist.With a \u201cpuff\u201d, Qingshu\u2019s cock was sent into her hole again, and returned to the warm and tight tunnel, unspeakably comforting, he couldn\u2019t wait to push it till the brim into the hole, and the bodies of the two of them moved. Their flesh quickly slapped together with every thrust, and in the quiet space where a needle dropping could be heard, it was embarrassing and ambiguous.Ruan Jiaojiao wrapped her whole body around Qingshu, her arms hooked hard at his neck and supported her chin on his shoulders, so she wouldn\u2019t fall off because of the fierce impact.Qingshu couldn\u2019t see her face, and naturally didn\u2019t know her expression at the moment, like a cat who succeeded in stealing fish, she smiled comfortably.It was better not doing it herself.Qingshu\u2019s movements were simple and rough, without any skills to speak of, but he was a God. Ruan Jiaojiao felt the warm current of spiritual power rushing to her dantian during the double cultivation process, especially when he shot out his essence, she felt a soft comfort, she was relaxed and light, as if she had inhaled contraband, she was so excited that she went straight to the world of bliss.The same was true for God Qingshu. The benefits brought by dual cultivation made him aware of the fullness of spiritual power, at this time he was already able to use his spiritual power to break the shackles, but he pretended not to recover, and tricked Ruan Jiaojiao to clamp him again. The two had another round of cloud and rain.When Ruan Jiaojiao was light-headed again, she only heard the iron chain 'screech\u201d and broke. Then, her body was held tightly by his sturdy arms, and the low, magnetic voice of God Qingshu came above her ears.\u201cThat Demonic Leader\u2019s magic weapon is extremely powerful, we have to hurry up, we should dual cultivate a few more times, and gather as much strength as possible to deal with him.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dRuan Jiaojiao screamed, Qing Shu once again smashed his iron rod. The meat stick pierced her slippery cunt smoothly.At that time, the two of them did not have to be limited by their postures, Qingshu had also drawn a boundary, his Immortal robe was spread under Ruan Jiaojiao, his free hand moved on her silky and delicate skin, and finally his big palm grabbed the alluring bumps that were on his mind. Ruan Jiaojiao groaned sensitively as he touched her delicate breast.Qingshu\u2019s terrifying comprehension could be seen on the path of dual cultivation, being his first time, he became more experienced without any teaching.He kneaded her bright red nipple, Ruan Jiaojiao trembled with pleasure, and more liquid poured out of her small cunt. He ate the hardened and bright red nipple into his mouth, licked, sucked and swallowed as if a rare delicacy. When he finally released it, it had already turned dark red.Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s cheeks were flushed, her beautiful eyes were like black jade soaked in water, delicate and clear, her red mouth was slightly open, and he could see her pink and lovely little tongue poking out.Qingshu\u2019s hard and cold heart turned into a puddle of spring water. He bowed his head and kissed her red lips. When he realized that he was actively kissing her, he felt that the taste was extremely wonderful.\u201cJiaojiao\u2026If we can go out, would you be willing to form an Immortal couple with me?\u201dAfter he was no longer a virgin, he became emotional, and was no different from an ordinary man. He kissed her lips obsessively, and asked.Before Ruan Jiaojiao had time to answer, the barrier set by Qingshu was suddenly torn apart by an overbearing and powerful external force. Qingshu quickly reacted between the lightning and flint, and with a wave of his hand, the two of them were properly dressed with their clean robes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

No wonder he was chosen to come here, he did have ability.Seeing the two people tangled together, it was hard to tell who would win.If it weren\u2019t for being in the Demon Realm, with thin reiki available in the air and at the loss of poisonous mist, Qingshu might still be slightly better.Ruan Jiaojiao thought to herself, but no matter how powerful God Qingshu is, what she stole from the Emperor was still very powerful.It made sense, the boss was the boss for a reason, the Emperor was able to sit in his position because of his power.While Ruan Jiaojiao was watching the lively scene, God Qingshu appeared in front of her, and grabbed her wrist.\u201cGo!\u201dIt seemed that after weighing his strengths and weaknesses, he knew that the situation in the battle would be deadlocked and it would not be good for the two of them, they had to leave the Demon Realm soon.The Demon Lord naturally would not let them go, and then blocked their paths.God Qingshu held Ruan Jiaojiao in his arms, and because of the scruples about her, the Demon was enraged.Seeing that the situation was unfavourable, Ruan Jiaojiao struggled to break free from Qingshu\u2019s arms and rushed towards the Demon Lord. She portrayed a brave appearance looking like a pebble sacrificing its life to hit a stone, hugged the Demon to resist his moves filled with killing intent with her petite body.\u201cGod! You go!!!\u201dThe system snubbed: \u201cAre you not worried that he will really leave you and go alone?\u201dIf the male lead left her to go back to the Immortal Realm, let alone him getting along with the female lead day and night, once the news of Ruan Jiaojiao getting captivated by the demons spread out, she won\u2019t be able to mix up with other celestial beings from then on.Ruan Jiaojiao looked at God Qingshu, who stood still in place like a sculpture, and said with a smile.\u201cYou don\u2019t understand, forget about everything else, the self-esteem of God Qingshu will not allow him to do this.\u201dTherefore, the two people who were originally inextricably powerful, but as the Demon Lord took Ruan Jiaojiao as a hostage, God Qingshu unfortunately lost.The evil Demon\u2019s big palm pinched Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s slender and fragile neck, and his brutal eyes glared towards Qingshu.With a flick of his sleeve, he threw a round object, Qingshu held it in his palm, and it turned out it was a red pill covered with a strange pattern.\u201cEat it! Or else I will kill her!!!\u201dQingshu took the pill and knew what it was with a glance.This pill would make cultivators dantian be sealed, and become just like a mortal, but the effect would last only one hour.However, a lot can happen in one hour, and Qingshu did not know what the demonic creature would do. If he lost his ability to protect themself, he may strangle the two immediately.As if he saw Qingshu\u2019s thoughts, the Demon Lord said with a laugh.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, if I wanted to kill you, I would have done so already and not wait till now.\u201dThen what exactly did he want to do?Not giving Qingshu a chance to think about it, he pushed an ice-shaped sharp blade which was leaning against Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s neck and pierced her silky-smooth skin with one clean stroke. Her delicate white skin oozed red blood. If it would have been even an inch deep, her throat would be cut and the blood would be splashed till three feet apart.Qingshu\u2019s eyes sank, no longer hesitating, he fed the pill into his mouth and swallowed it down.The Demon Lord laughed wickedly, moved his ice blade, lowered his head and licked the smeared blood on it with the tip of his tongue.Ruan Jiaojiao: \u201c\u2026\u201dThe action was really that of a perverted villain!Just as the Demon Lord was feeling proud with the win, Ruan Jiaojiao, who was originally quiet as a chicken, suddenly held his wrist which held the knife with both of her hands and stabbed him in the abdomen.Her moves were sneaky which took the demon by surprise. It was a pity that the difference between the two of them was too great, and because he had a strong spiritual body, she was only able to cut through his robes, consequently she was severely slapped by Dongfang. She fell to the ground instantly, spouting out a mouthful of blood.Ruan Jiaojiao was like a tattered rag doll, picked up from the ground by the Demon Lord, and once again got held in his arms.He pinched her chin.\u201cWant to attack me? Heh\u2026\u201dHis laugh was cold and sinister, and with a wave of his hand, a barrier circled out, and the dense black mist blocked Qingshu\u2019s sight.\u201cThis is a good play.\u201dThe barrier which was formed blocked Qingshu from the other two. The Demon Lord immediately changed his expression and praised her.Ruan Jiaojiao leaned in his arms, and said softly.\u201cIt\u2019s my honour.\u201dBut his fingers which were on her tightened, causing her to frown.\u201cWhat did you do with him just now?\u201dRuan Jiaojiao didn\u2019t show it on her face, but she was panicked, could it be that they were seen by him?\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d\u201cHehe\u2026Don\u2019t try to lie with me\u2026 You dual cultivated with him to help him recover his spiritual powers, and you are deliberately letting me play this bitter scene with you, do you want him to feel guilty about this in his heart, and thus let him fall in love with you? \u201cFuck! How could this Demon Lord understand her ways so well?Now that she had been seen through, Ruan Jiaojiao simply confessed, and so she explained.\u201cYes! I\u2019m not willing to let him off so easily, I want to get his heart first, and then take revenge on him.\u201dHis big palm moved over her cheeks, stroking her delicate and smooth skin, from the neck to collarbone to all the way down, covering the side of her side of the milky globes, and rubbed vigorously.\u201cIf you want to make him feel guilty, why don\u2019t I help you to act more seriously!\u201dAs soon as his voice fell, the demon\u2019s big hand tore through her robes, Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s eyes widened, she did not expect him to behave like this.Before she had time to react, he had already turned her over, lifted the hem of her torn robes, wrapped her waist with one arm, and then poked into her in the same posture, thrusting his hot meat stick into her flower hole.His movements were rough and unrestrained. Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s skirt hung like a torn strip of cloth on the exquisite curves of her body. Following his movements, like the wind blowing over, she couldn\u2019t block any intrusion by him. Her two balls of snowy flesh which bounced and trembled, then was groped by his hand, as he played wantonly.Ruan Jiaojiao was embarrassed and desperate, biting her lower lip and resisted making any sound.Damn he was such a pervert!Although there was a barrier separating them, whenever she thought that Qingshu was nearby, maybe even less than half a foot away, her blood boiled all over her body, and her skin was sweating crystal tears.\u201cIs this feeling good? Am I better or that Qingshu?\u201d His evil voice wafted in her ears.Ruan Jiaojiao was stunned, and then realized that she didn\u2019t feel any pain this time, she didn\u2019t have the pain of the demonic energy tearing into her body. Instead, as he fiddled and thrust in her flower hole, she gradually felt a tingling pleasure.\u201cYou? How?\u201d Ruan Jiaojiao was puzzled, and finally made a sound.\u201cI suppressed the demonic energy in me, so you won\u2019t feel uncomfortable.\u201d The Demon Lord explained.He then pulled out his meat stick, then pounded it into her hard till he stuffed her to the brim. Ruan Jiaojiao couldn\u2019t hold back her groans and yelled out a \u201cAh\u201d when stimulated, filled with joy and pain.TLers Note:System: Me wants a one on one volume of the Demon Lord papapa-ing Ruan Jiaojiao with plot owowo \u2013 so far, he is system\u2019s favorite character in these endless chapters of a book kekekAlso sorry for not updating yesterday, system wanted to, but well my mind\u2019s not been so well hehe, is all muddled QAQThough another update coming up today!

When he saw the Demon Lord bullying and ravaging her, he felt his heart suddenly sink, and sensed a dull ache like someone took a heavy hammer and hit him. He almost felt suffocated, forgetting to react, and could only stand there frozen, not wanting to believe that the scene before him was true.Ruan Jiaojiao saw Qingshu\u2019s handsome face turn pale, and the emotions surging in his dark ink like eyes, as if it contained shock and horror, she turned her head to look at the Demon Lord, and saw him curl his lips, evoking an evil and cold smile.Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s hands on the ground suddenly collapsed by her weight which were solely supported by them, her body weakened, but her waist was firmly confined in the Demon Lord\u2019s arms. Although her upper body went limp, her buttocks were still raised high, and she continued to be played by him. The Demon slapped and fiddled with her bouncy and soft flesh.For a while, the air seemed to be freezing, no one spoke, only the sounds of slapping skins could be heard inside.Ruan Jiaojiao lowered her eyes and head. The silk robes were already messy. With her movements, they kept fluttering, completely concealing her expression, only part of her white skin was left exposed. She looked down, her nails digging deeply into the palm, squeezing them into clenched fist.The stiff God Qingshu seemed to finally come back to his senses, he moved and tried to fight desperately to stop the adultery committed by the Demon Lord.But because of the effect of the pill he had consumed earlier, he could not even tear open the barrier just then. The Demon Lord sent a bone-chilling glare to him, and Qingshu\u2019s body seemed to be unmovable by a spell placed over him from which he couldn\u2019t even move a finger.\u201cThe taste of this Immortal is really wonderful, no wonder ordinary people say that it is worth celebrating to be a celestial being. I have an Immortal now. Isn\u2019t it so?\u201d His contemptuous and provocative words echoed&amp;nbsp; and rang in the quiet space.The Demon Lord seemed to enjoy this situation very much, but when he glanced at Ruan Jiaojiao, he suddenly felt a bit dissatisfied with exposing her beautiful and attractive body to other men, even though many women in the Demon Realm dressed in an exposing manner and even wandered around naked, but Ruan Jiaojiao, that woman was different.Any man wants to monopolize his prey, not to mention that he had already marked this woman with his own mark and had already acquired her into his own bag.He tore off the black cloak on his body, Ruan Jiaojiao only felt that in front of her eyes went dark, and the top of the demon lord\u2019s cloak covered her. In the darkness, Ruan Jiaojiao took off the burden of acting and put her face on his arm comfortably. The movement of the demon lord carrying her up and down brought her wave after wave of pleasure.Qing Shu looked at the petite body which kept trembling.The Demon Lord only acted this out to stimulate and attack Qingshu. The erotic play did not last too long, he spread out the cloak, and the black cloak enveloped Ruan Jiaojiao completely. He hugged her in his arms and leaned to her ears. And smiled.\u201cThat\u2019s enough acting for today, let\u2019s change to a comfortable place to continue.\u201dRuan Jiaojiao could feel that she was taken out of the prison, and along the way, she could also vaguely hear the respectful salute of his subordinates to the Demon Lord.The black cloak that had wrapped her up to her feet was torn off, Ruan Jiaojiao moved her gaze away from his wicked and handsome face, and looked at her surroundings curiously.\u201cThis is what you call a comfortable place?\u201d She raised an eyebrow.The Demon hugged her from behind, jokingly said.\u201cYour attitude towards me now seems to be far from respectful. Did you not say that you are willing to be a slave or a concubine for me?\u201dRuan Jiaojiao\u2019s complexion became stiff, she said it casually at that time, he had actually remembered it until now.However, she was originally an aloof and arrogant Goddess, and even if she was in trouble with the demons, her attitude could not be changed.Fortunately, looking at his expression on his handsome face, there was no annoyance.\u201cMy Lord, I helped you catch that God Qingshu.\u201d She reminded him vaguely, asking for praise.The Demon Lord squeezed her little face.\u201cWell, you did a good job.\u201d\u201cHow do you plan to deal with him?\u201d Ruan Jiaojiao asked.\u201cWhat do you want me to do with your old lover?\u201dThe tone which the Demon spoke in was somewhat meaningful, and his eyes were a little bit ill-intentioned, Ruan Jiaojiao went silent for a moment.\u201cDon\u2019t hurt him for now, after all, he is a God and has a high status in the Immortal Realm. Once the battle between the Demons and Immortals evokes, he can be a good chess piece in your hand at that time.\u201d Ruan Jiaojiao stood in the direction of the Demon Lord and offered her advice to him.Hearing this, his eyes were really unpredictable, she was unable to guess what he was thinking, Ruan Jiaojiao immediately used her beauty to ease the atmosphere between them.Her soft arms were pressed against his neck, a pair of watery eyes stared at him, her eyes gleaming, she was the most deceptive person like a demon found in a\u00a0 millennium, exuding a pure and charming aura.\u201cMy lord\u2026 have you tasted this?\u201dIf she asked this in any other situation, there would have been no good fruit for him to eat, but now that\u00a0 a beautiful woman was in his arms, the Demon bit her red lips fiercely, and ravaged her soft mouth, sucking all the sweet juice he could find.Ruan Jiaojiao wrapped her legs around his waist and hovered around him like a slippery snake. Her ass didn\u2019t touch the bed below. When she thought of lying on this bed, her bones went freezing cold.At that time the two of them were in a room with nothing but a couch.And the couch was actually a huge piece of ice that was so smooth that it could lie on a dozen people. Apart from this, there was really no other decoration in the room.Later, Ruan Jiaojiao realized that this was the residence of the Demon Lord.It didn\u2019t take long for the news in the Demon Realm to spread, all the Demons soon knew their Demon Lord finally had a woman.Even if the other person was not a demon, it made them happy and weep with joy nonetheless.In the past, they had searched for countless beautiful women from the mortal world or the Demon Realm, but they were all ignored by their Lord.In their clan, for thousands of years, countless women had followed the Demon Lord and had never won the favour of him in that aspect.Everyone had discussed privately, was it possible that the Demon Lord was not able to do it?There was a bold and courageous person who threw herself into the arms of their Demon Lord\u2026 the result\u2026 The end was tragic.Ruan Jiaojiao put on a stealthy magic weapon and sneaked into the water prison where Qingshu was held.God Qingshu\u2019s eyes were shut tight, his hands were still firmly locked on the wall, and most of his body was soaked in water.\u201cGod Qingshu, it\u2019s me.\u201dHearing her voice, Qingshu opened his eyes, and his dark eyes were like a cuttlefish soaked in water, bright and deep in colour.Ruan Jiaojiao took off the stealth magic weapon and walked towards him. When she touched the water, a terrible coldness immediately penetrated into her body, making her feel that her warm blood was almost condensing into a bitter cold like ice.She immediately used her spiritual power to protect herself, sped up her movements, and finally stuck to his cold body, she used her spiritual powers to conjure a dagger, and cut off the shackles that restricted him.Ruan Jiaojiao hugged Qingshu and dragged him out of the water. She felt that wherever she held him, it wasn\u2019t like holding a person rather like holding a big block of ice, and it hurt her everywhere.Without thinking, she unbuttoned the clothes of the two of them and pressed her warm body to him snuggling him.Ruan Jiaojiao asked in a trembling voice when she felt better.\u201cGod Qingshu, how are you feeling?\u201dQingshu was motionless like a sculpture. Just as Ruan Jiaojiao was thinking about how to perform the next play, the man who had been motionless suddenly rolled over and pressed her under her body, and then his thin cold lips blocked hers slightly. His open lips and tongue directly penetrated into her mouth, fighting with her one-sidedly in a desperate manner.Ruan Jiaojiao was taken aback. Her hands were pressed on top of her head, with her legs separated. Without hesitation, he pushed in her as they shook violently.His body gradually became warm and firm, but his movements were still sharp and cruel, as if wanting to ruin her, but Ruan Jiaojiao quickly became interested in such roughness and secreted more fluids. The large amount of liquid lubricated the two people\u2019s moving organs, making their movements gradually become smoother.When Qing Shu\u2019s lower body moved wildly, his lips and teeth kept kissing and licking her.This kind of performance was really different from the first time the two of them did it.Ruan Jiaojiao couldn\u2019t help but wonder, did he go crazy?TLers Note:System: Hehe our FL\u2026 really is\u2026 adventurous? system speechless.jpgAlso system saw the NU page for her projects for a first time in a while <s>me was just curious uwuwu</s> , happy to see y\u2019all like to enjoy <s>the little plot which can hardly be seen</s> BPETIT like system does \u2013 and welps those who don\u2019t, ancestors will be proud.jpgPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Ruan Jiaojiao had stayed on the ice bed in the residence of the Demon Lord for a long time, and then she felt the warm white mist embracing her. It gave her an indescribable comfort.Although Qingshu\u2019s movements were rude and fierce, she could obviously feel the benefits of dual cultivating with him, which did not make her dissatisfied with his monotonous piston movements.With the man\u2019s repressed and restrained panting and groaning, Ruan Jiaojiao felt a hot stream hit the depths of her honey pot. She opened her dim eyes in the steamy room, and met Qingshu\u2019s eyes, feeling pleasure, but there was a deeper and more intense pain.\u201cSorry\u2026\u2026\u201dQingshu sighed in her ear, full of guilt and shame.When Ruan Jiaojiao wanted to say a few words of comfort to him, she didn\u2019t expect that the meat stick he had just withdrawn would come in again in a blink of an eye.Because of the lubrication of the two people\u2019s love juices, he immediately pushed into the depths of her body easily, Ruan Jiaojiao felt the inexplicable soreness and pain which came with his movement, she opened her mouth letting out a loud groan. Qingshu leaned over and her red lips were once again taken into his possession.Qingshu moved quickly and eagerly, like a hungry wolf leaping at a sheep, greedily gulping and enjoying the saliva in her mouth, demanding her, releasing his seeds into her over and over again.Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s mouth was held by him, and his tongue stirred in her mouth, making her unable to speak.She was a little confused by the male protagonist\u2019s tricks, so she asked the system to come out and chat for a while, and then she learned that the male protagonist was greatly stimulated.On the one hand, he was embarrassed for not being able to protect her, and on the other hand, he witnessed her being abused by the Demon who did the forbidden things to her. He was very angry but powerless, so he just wanted to dual cultivate with her to improve his strength and immediately take her away.That\u2019s it.Ruan Jiaojiao looked at God Qingshu who completely freed himself and worked hard to have her.Geez\u2026It was so pitiful to think that his struggle would eventually fail because of her interference.Ruan Jiaojiao didn\u2019t intend to let Qingshu complete the hero\u2019s rescue of the beauty single-handedly, and under her arrangement, the Immortal Realm already knew that the two had become prisoners of the Demons, and someone would come to rescue them.God Luo Ya would come too, and of course the female lead would also come because of the male lead.The imminent battle between Immortals and Demons, this immersive experience, she could watch the special effects of it outside in a movie theatre which would be much more magnificent and shocking, Ruan Jiaojiao was still a little excited thinking about it.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dAfter the rain stopped and the clouds rested <sup>1</sup> System: When they finished doing the deed \u2013 intercourse , Qing Shu finally dispelled the demonic energy that restrained his cultivation. He excitedly held Ruan Jiaojiao tightly in his arms, like a precious treasure that was lost but found again, and couldn\u2019t wait to take her out of this deep and hell-like Demon Realm.\u201cNo, the Demon Lord has planted a demon seed in me. Once I leave the Demon Realm, I will burst into pieces and die.\u201dRuan Jiaojiao looked at Qingshu infatuatedly, with nostalgia and reluctance in her eyes, but these emotions were quickly suppressed by her, and she said to Qingshu calmly.\u201cNow that I have suffered this calamity, maybe this is my destiny, God Qingshu, you should go quickly, I cannot go back to the Immortal Realm.\u201d\u201cNo, I brought you in this situation, so I will also take you out of it.\u201dThe God Qingshu grabbed Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s wrist and injected his divine sense into her body to search for the demon seed, and he found it.When he tried his best to get rid of the demon seed, he failed after several attempts.\u201cDon\u2019t try again, God Qingshu.\u201dRuan Jiaojiao was not surprised by the result, she had lied to Qingshu.The function of this thing was not to prevent her from leaving the Demon Realm, but to allow the Demon Lord to find her at any time.This thing was planted when she was first caught by him.A huge wave set off in the eyes of God Qingshu, and the complex contradictions in the heart which were entangled with his thoughts .In the end, reason prevailed, and Qingshu left alone.After the last nightmare and miserable situation, he knew that even if he stayed, they would not be able to beat the Demon Lord, and she might even be abused and tortured by him.There was only one chance.So, when everyone in the Immortal Realm was preparing to attack the Demon Realm and rescue the two, there was a sudden good news.The God Qingshu was back!The Empress was the most excited, and wanted to know if Ruan Jiaojiao was safe, she immediately planned to call upon God Qingshu. At that time, everyone felt an afterimage dangling by, and then God Luo Ya was gone.\u201cWhy is it only you?!\u201dLuo Ya stood in front of Qingshu.The eyes of the two gods meet, the two of them were very shallow, everyone said that they both were very cold.At this moment, only God Qingshu was seen, and the woman was not seen, Luo Ya narrowed his eyes dangerously.He couldn\u2019t find Ruan Jiaojiao at the beginning, and when he heard that she had gone with God Qingshu, he was angry and frustrated at the same time.But then when he thought about it, maybe she did so to try and avoid him.The two of them spent such a wonderful time in the mortal world, and the deep-seated taste returned with Luo Ya to the Immortal Realm. As long as he saw her, he couldn\u2019t help but control his desire.She was so charming, he could not help himself, it was like he had turned crazy.It was ridiculous, why had he ever even bullied her.Luo Ya was too eager to advance the relationship between the two, but he had no experience. He was a superior God, but he acted out like a young boy who fell in love for the first time. He was so anxious that he looked like a kid, crushing over a beautiful woman.God Luo Ya wanted to wait for her to return, so he could propose to the Emperor and the Empress to form a relationship with her as an immortal couple.But unexpectedly, what he was eagerly looking forward to was the bad news that the two were missing.Within the six realms, he rummaged through them one by one, except for the Demon Realm that he couldn\u2019t penetrate into, however, he did not expect that she would fall into the hands of Demon Lord.Facing Luo Ya\u2019s aggressive questioning, God Qingshu was silent for a moment, and as he spoke after a while, his voice was cold.\u201cWhen I go to see the Emperor and the Empress, I will report the truth.\u201dLuo Ya still blocked his way.\u201cWhat about her? How come you are the only one to come back! Why did you come back alone!!!\u201dThe Empress was anxiously waiting for God Qingshu to come, but what she heard was a report, God Luo Ya and God Qingshu fought.The two great Gods of the Immortal Realm were fighting, everyone in the realm immediately rushed to watch the show with excitement when they heard the news.The two seem to be inextricably fighting, their strengths were equal, the fire with lightning clashed, that was what you could call marvellous.But after careful consideration, the God Qingshu obviously went easy on God Luo Ya, and seemed to be enraged with red eyes, as if he was dealing with the villains in the Demon Realm, not a comrade in the Immortal Realm.Of course, the battle between the two came to an abrupt end when the Emperor and the Empress arrived.When everyone felt that their fight was still not over, they heard the Supreme God Qingshu\u2019s report that Ruan Jiaojiao was threatened by the Demon Lord, and was trapped in the Demon Realm, unable to leave.Their Goddess was locked in the Demon Realm and was allowed to be insulted by the Demon Lord, how could this be done!TLers Note:System: begging for forgiveness.jpgSystem at this point feels like a scum QAQ Sorry for such irregular updates, y\u2019all don\u2019t deserve this ;-;This period in system\u2019s life is just too busy with the pending assignments and upcoming finals.

Although it was excusable, he had taken the person there in the first place. The Empress also trusted him, thus giving him the responsibility of bringing her back safely. However, he had come back alone. No complaints from people was impossible.When they thought of Ruan Jiaojiao, the immaculate Goddess being trapped in the Demon Realm, suffering from torture and humiliation, in a miserable and tragic situation, for a period of time, many people in the Immortal Realm had a lot of criticisms about God Qingshu and were disappointed in his ability.The perfect image God Qingshu originally established in the Immortal Realm was damaged. He was silent to everyone\u2019s criticism and slander, and did not argue with them, but Lan Xue beside him was extremely angry about this.How can they blame God Qingshu?If it weren\u2019t for the drag of Ruan Jiaojiao, God Qingju would not be trapped in the Demon Realm in order to protect her. How could no one mention the pain that God Qingshu had suffered for her?Since Ruan Jiaojiao was a profound girl above the nine heavens, she should be righteous. Under such a situation, she would rather be a weakness than being strong, rather than being trapped in the Demon Realm alone and dying, not even helping, moreover she also defiled the reputation of God Qingshu.One is a God, and the other is just a Goddess. Who was more important in contributing to the strength of the Immortal Realm? Wasn\u2019t it clear in one glance?To put it bluntly, it was the Empress\u2019s selfishness, because Ruan Jiaojiao was her niece, so God Qingshu was plagued by gossip, and the Emperor and the Empress did not even say a word for him.It was really unfair!Lan Xue couldn\u2019t tell whether she felt wronged because of Qingshu\u2019s injustice or was jealous of Ruan Jiaojiao who was being so much favoured by all the celestial beings.However, what about it, no matter how beautiful she was, she was now nothing but a captive of the Demon Realm, which was pitiful to think about.Lan Xue looked at God Qingshu. Since the return from the Demon Realm, God Qingshu had changed to a whole new person. Although he used to be cold, he would inadvertently reveal a little gentleness towards her.Unlike now, when he came back, he seemed to lose his heart and soul, and finally practised in closed doors. Even if God Qingshu showed up occasionally, he would eventually turn a deaf ear to her and be silent.Lan Xue felt stunned and uncomfortable in her heart that she couldn\u2019t tell. She thought of God Luo Ya\u2019s attitude towards her.God Luo Ya once showed favourable affection and concern for her, and said that if she encountered any difficulties, she could ask him for help, so that Lan Xue, who has just arrived in the Immortal Realm, felt warmer, and even Luo Ya helped her teach the one who bullied her, that woman a lesson.But since the banquet of Immortals, Luo Ya\u2019s attitude had changed. He originally hated that woman, but suddenly his behaviour took a turn and revolved around that woman. His attitude was so diligent that Lan Xue felt it was incredible, giving her a\u00a0 sore throat.Later, God Luo Ya fought with God Qingshu, and then single-handedly broke into the Demon Realm, trying to rescue Ruan Jiaojiao, now everyone knows God Luo Ya admires that woman.Concerned about the fate of his niece, the Empress was anxious, but it was too much to consume a large amount of troops to attack the Demon Realm for a Goddess, and the Emperor was hesitant about making a decision.Previously, because the High God Qingshu was imprisoned together with Goddess Ruan Jiaojiao, the status of God Qingshu and the weight he had in the Immortal Realm had changed. If Ruan Jiaojiao were to be assimilated by the Demon Lord and degenerated into a demon, the consequences would be disastrous. So the Emperor was finally ready to send troops to save her.The pillow talk that the Empress did finally worked, and under her soft guidance, the Emperor finally settled his mind.The Immortal Realm officially declared war on the Demon Realm, and the two great Gods Qingshu and Luo Ya took the initiative to start the battle.The celestial soldiers flooded into the Demon Realm like mocking water, as the armed forces approached the city, the demons were released.The Demon Lord came with his arms around Ruan Jiaojiao. At that time, Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s black dress fluttered with the wind, like clouds and mist were, as if it blended with the black cloak of the Demon beside her, but it made her snowy white skin and red lips highlight even more. The beauty in front of them could make Heaven and the Earth lose its colour.Seeing Ruan Jiaojiao appear, the Demon Lord and her looked like a couple full of intimacy. God Qingshu and God Luo Ya only felt that their hearts were pierced by a sword, and their visions became blurred, they felt as if their hearts and souls were torn apart. The pain came too quickly.Qingshu and Luo Ya both had pale faces, and no one spoke for a while.Lan Xue, who was standing behind Qingshu, suddenly spoke, and said to Ruan Jiaojiao with awe.\u201cGoddess, now the Immortals and Demons are fighting because of you. As a member of the Immortal Realm, do you really have the heart to bear the death of the creatures in the six realms and let their blood flow like that into a river?\u201dRuan Jiaojiao rolled her eyes looking at the female protagonist who suddenly appeared to show everyone her presence.Damn, the high hat <sup>1</sup> System: Slang for being left out, condescended to, or otherwise being screwed out of what\u2019s rightfully yours. The \u201cHigh Hat\u201d can be either given or received. of the female lead that was buckled on her, she had made it clear that Ruan Jiaojiao should swing a sword to slay and cut herself off. This was the most poisonous woman\u2019s heart she had seen.But the female lead\u2019s words would still inevitably shake the mind of the soldiers. If she allowed the celestial beings and the demons to go to war because of her, it would appear that her beauty caused this disaster.Ruan Jiaojiao lifted her lips and smiled, but she did not look at Lan Xue, but at the man in front of her.God Qingshu and God Luo Ya both trembled slightly.She looked sideways at the Demon Lord, and entered the secret tunnel with a sound transmission that only the two of them could hear.\u201cThank you Lord for your care during this time.\u201dWhen she said this, Ruan Jiaojiao felt her teeth sore.This Demon Lord was very careful, and was a companion like a tiger, that demon was a big bastard.Knowing that she had let Qingshu go, the Demon had pinched her face in a tight hold, and kept her in a small black room and had his way with her every night, all kinds of SM plays were played out and the degree of his perversion was horrible.The system silently complained about her appetite.\u201cWhen did the host endure with tears? You were clearly enjoying it.\u201d Otherwise, she could use points to exchange with it as before and escape.The female lead wanted to take the opportunity to knock her off again, don\u2019t think about it!The most important thing was that she was now very interested in the side quests. As for the battle of Immortals and Demons, although it was very regrettable that she could not witness it with her own eyes, she was also very happy to be able to respond to the female protagonist.\u201cLan Xue, I know that you like God Qingshu, thus you want me to die, so you don\u2019t need to say such high-sounding words. I only wanted to see him once again till I am alive.\u201dThe corners of Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s lips were smiling, her eyes were full of beauty, and her moves were full of brilliance.At that moment, she seemed to be suffocatingly beautiful, exuding an unparalleled charm that enchanted all beings.Under the eyes of everyone, Ruan Jiaojiao flashed a cold light with a thin blade in her hand. The Demon Lord hadn\u2019t had time to react. She had swung her knife and killed herself. The whole person turned into a plume of smoke, and disappeared without a trace in the blink of an eye.The immortals and demons seemed to have had a dream, their faces were in a daze.Does such a stunning beauty really exist?Otherworldly and ethereal, beautiful.The world was jealous of her beauty, so she disappeared like a plume of smoke.Wrong!Everyone immediately thought that if an immortal passed away then the soul would return to the cycle of six reincarnations.But then everyone sighed again, however the Immortal Goddess was no longer there.At that time, God Qingshu, God Luo Ya, and the Demon Lord froze, after a brief moment of being in shock and stunned, they realised that suddenly the figure disappeared in place and turned into three phantoms of light to go straight to the underworld.The people of the Immortal Realm and Demon Realm faced each other across the river, looking at each other.Do you want to fight again?What a fart!TLers Note:System: And this was the long due Kofi update that system owed wuuu ;-;Sigh scummy system feels so grateful looking at your comments, Merry Christmas everyone!

This old lady hurts!!!Ruan Jiaojiao touched her neck as she woke up, it was as if she was still in the battle against the Immortals and Demons with the golden and iron clad horses.She stretched out a hand and touched her head, a man\u2019s low, magnetic voice sounded more gentle and sultry in the silent night.\u201cJiaojiao had a nightmare again?\u201dRuan Jiaojiao raised her eyes, and met a pair of dark and deep eyes, which seemed to be filled with dazzling galaxies, and the man\u2019s passionate voice was so intense as if the man wanted to hide and envelope her.\u201cMaster\u2026 this disciple is afraid\u2026\u201dRuan Jiaojiao put her small face on the man\u2019s arm, he took her petite body into his arms in a pampering manner, and stroked her back with his warm palms.Ruan Jiaojiao deliberately ignored the ambiguous and weird atmosphere, closed her eyes and pretended to sleep. After a while, when she started to feel confused, she heard the man sigh as if there was nothing.Jiaojiao, when will you grow up?He felt that he was about to become a beast.He couldn\u2019t hide his intentions any longer.Even if the cultivation base of God Luo Ya was high, he was not completely invincible in the world.Ruan Jiaojiao was playing with the little monsters in the bamboo forest not far away by the stream. Suddenly, she felt a gust of wind blowing and enveloping her with a clear breath. The little monsters sensed something wrong, and immediately fled around and hid. A trace was finally found.I finally found you.God Qingshu looked at the little girl who was squatting with complicated eyes.She looked around only seven or eight years old, her brows and eyes had not yet fully developed up, her soft face still had baby fat, she was white and looked cute, even though she was still so immature, you could\u00a0 vaguely see the gorgeous appearance and the allure behind her young looks.Ruan Jiaojiao had her own system. Even if she fell into reincarnation and the cycle of rebirth, she still remembered her earlier births. Of course, she recognized the Immortal man in front of her at a glance, but she still blinked her big eyes with innocence. The thick, fan-like eyelashes trembled, which seemed to poke into Qingshu\u2019s heart.Ever since losing her, God Luo Ya has tied a small bell on her ankle. Once he encounters the breath of the Immortal or Demon Realm, this will activate the bell and send a warning signal to him.In an instant, God Luo Ya appeared.\u201cMaster\u2026\u201dWhen she saw Luo Ya, Ruan Jiaojiao immediately rushed over and hugged Luo Ya\u2019s thigh, timidly hiding behind him.\u201cUnexpectedly, God Luo Ya would not stay in the Immortal Realm and\u00a0 would rather hide in the poor country of the mortal world.\u201dGod Qingshu spoke in an unhurried and authentic tone, and his voice was full of irony.But he knew that he was so jealous, why couldn\u2019t he find her first! Luo Ya, he took possession of her for the past few years after her rebirth.Facing Qingshu\u2019s ridicule, Luo Ya\u2019s expression was faint, but her figure was still blocked, almost completely shielding Ruan Jiaojiao behind her.\u201cThe old grievances have already turned into dust and have disappeared. She has forgotten all about whatever has happened. Why bother yourself. You were sorry for her at the beginning, but she is doing well now. Your reappearing will only add to the burden.\u201dAs a man, Qingshu knew Luo Ya\u2019s thoughts. He stopped talking nonsense and flung his long sleeves.\u201cShe doesn\u2019t belong to you! Let me see her!\u201dWhen the two men were about to have a fight, suddenly there was another slender figure in the air flying down like a white petal.\u201cGod Qingshu! She has been reincarnated now, and is no longer a Goddess, you see it clearly! She is a demon! The demons have a different route to follow, you cannot bring her back to the Immortal Realm! Please don\u2019t do this!\u201dLan Xue stepped forward to stop Qingshu and Luo Ya, and looked at Ruan Jiaojiao with a complicated expression.Why?!Why? she is no longer an aloof Goddess! Why is God Qingshu still reluctant to give her up, even going around the heaven and the earth, searching for her for hundreds of years in all the Six Realms.Moreover, she was just a little demon with low spirituality now, but still God Qingshu and God Luo Ya had to fight again for her.Lan Xue\u2019s unwillingness and jealousy accumulated for hundreds of years turned into bitter gaze towards Ruan Jiaojiao.These hundreds of years had not been well for her.The words she had said at the beginning added to the jealousy. There were rumours in the Immortal Realm that she had a vicious heart and wanted to kill the Goddess Ruan Jiaojiao. The Empress even regarded her as a thorn in her eyes, making her isolated and left humiliated, but the God Luo Ya who had protected her back then and God Qingshu who treated her tenderly had long since disappeared.She knew that they went looking for her.But why?!She obviously did the right thing! In such a situation, she should have died!As a Goddess, her reputation was gone, and she had become a captive of the Demon Lord. Was it really okay to lead a battle between the Immortals and the Demons, to the catastrophe of the six realms?If Lan Xue had just blurted it out on an impulse, but after so long of hearing people\u2019s remarks it led to her negative emotions, she now hates her to death!Perceiving Lan Xue\u2019s hostility keenly, Ruan Jiaojiao shrank and tugged at Luo Ya\u2019s robe.\u201cThat aunt\u2019s eyes are so fierce, Master\u2026 Jiaojiao is afraid\u2026\u201dAunt? ! !Lan Xue was so angry that a mouthful of old blood was in her mouth and almost spurted out in anger, then she saw God Luo Ya sending a sharp glare like a knife. Her unconcealed dislike for Ruan Jiaojiao just now was also\u00a0 noticed by God Qingshu.\u201cLan Xue, you no longer hold a position in my abode.\u201d Qingshu God\u2019s eyes swept lightly, his attitude indifferent and alienated.Talking about this, Lan Xue was very upset. She had come to the lower realm to find God Qingshu.She had spent those comfortable days by his side because of the care of the Supreme God Qingshu before, and now she couldn\u2019t bear it but she had turned into a humble servant girl sent by others.In addition, because of the Goddess Ruan Jiaojiao, she was ostracised and ignored everywhere.Therefore, she wanted to cheerlessly intercede with God Qingshu, even\u2026even to be honest about her heart\u2026Anyway, thanks to Ruan Jiaojiao, because of what she had said, everyone already knew that she loved God.She didn\u2019t expect that when she sneaked into the Demon Realm and would finally find God Qingshu, but unfortunately saw that he ultimately found the reincarnated Ruan Jiaojiao.Lan Xue was resentful, how could this work?Now that the God Qingshu found her, he will ignore her even more.So Lan Xue changed her mind and thought about it.\u201cThe Demon Lord is also looking for her these years. If the two Gods really fight and cause a lot of disturbance, not only will both of you lose and get hurt, but the Demon Lord will benefit from it.\u201d She reminded them kindly.After Lan Xue\u2019s reconciliation, the two decided to live together peacefully for the time being.But when no one had paid attention to Ruan Jiaojiao, and it was later discovered that she had disappeared. They used their divine sense to look around, and found that the little girl had mumbled to Lan Xue for a while, and then ran away from there.The two of them vented their anger on Lan Xue, only because she provoked something, did everything go wrong.Lan Xue felt she was really wronged this time.Ruan Jiaojiao slipped away. She had planned to escape for a long time. She also hid a bottle of elixir, and incidentally blacked Lan Xue more in the eyes of the two Gods.She has a lot of grudges against the female lead, if it weren\u2019t for this woman, she would have been able to see the Immortals against Demons battle.When she popped a bottle of elixir like jelly beans in her mouth, her seven or eight-year-old little body instantly transformed into a young girl, like a flower bud that instantly bloomed with unparalleled beauty.She deliberately didn\u2019t eat the elixir that Luo Ya had given her, thus she was always in a childlike state, so that Luo Ya could see and touch but couldn\u2019t eat.Let him be a beast, hum!When she saw her side mission target appear, Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s eyes lit up, shining like pearls, and the brilliance oozed out like flowing water.It was hard to go through the fantasy world.Since there were Immortals and Demons, how can there be no demons to have fun with for her.\u201cHusband!\u201dThe girl\u2019s voice was soft and beautiful, like a yellow oriole coming out of the valley, flying into his arms like a butterfly, hugging the handsome boy\u2019s waist.The teenager has a tall and straight figure, smooth skin like a jade, and his facial features did not lose to any woman, Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s nympho self was almost overflowing.Her favourite is Xiao Jing!Little Demon Jing, who had been cultivated by the white fox for thousands of years, and didn\u2019t know what bliss tasted like.The system secretly thought, so she asked to reincarnate her as a Demon in this life, not as a Goddess, just to make it easy for her to hook up with the male Demon named Jing?Ruan Jiaojiao genuinely smiled.\u201cNo, I still have to add an obstacle for the male lead and the second male lead. Unless they give up their status as a God, they cannot be with me with my Demon Jing. Then I will always be the cinnabar mole in their hearts which they can\u2019t get.\u201dTLers Note:System: And cause it\u2019s Christmas today, system thought doing multiple updates will be nice >w<Also Xiao Jing really is super adorable! <s>However, system still roots for the demon lord and jiaojiao</s> (>//-//<)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She smiled and looked breath-taking.The two of them looked calm on the surface, but their insides were full of turbulence.She\u2026 It\u2019s her!Qingshu and Luo Ya looked at each. Both wanted to pre-emptively appear in front of her.The girl seemed to hear someone calling her. She was like a little deer in the forest, jumping happily, rushing towards a white-clothed boy not far away, almost the whole person was hanging on the boy\u2019s body, his eyes and smile overflowing with love for the teenager.With the cultivation base of the two Gods, they could see that this young man was a ten thousand year old fox demon at one glance.But the two people were talented and beautiful, like a pair, like a golden boy with a jade girl, their looks and temperament were exceptionally good, and the atmosphere between the two was happy and sweet that it was almost impossible to get in between the two of them.Qingshu and Luo Ya didn\u2019t act rashly, but used a stealth technique to spy on their every move like two stalkers in the dark.She seemed to be the same, but she has changed her body. The Goddess had disappeared. After reincarnation, she was indeed just like what Lan Xue said, she was a little Demon with extremely low spiritual power.Because of Luo Ya\u2019s careful care, her eyes were as innocent and naive as a child, and as a Demon, it made her more charming and bolder in her clothes.She wore a beautiful red dress which looked like burning fire, her legs were wrapped around the teenager\u2019s waist, and the snow-white slender legs were fully exposed under her skirt. Her name was seductive, and her demeanour charming and appealing.As a ten thousand year fox demon, Mo Ling could naturally notice something strange, there was someone from the Immortal Realm.He involuntarily hugged the girl in his arms, in fact, he knew her former identity.When she first appeared in front of him and rushed into his arms to call her husband, he had recognized her at a glance, even though she lied to herself that the two had a previous marriage.He was her husband, and she entered the reincarnation with her memory, reincarnated, and then came to him.Were you kidding me?The holy and noble Goddess above the nine heavens, how could that Immortal and Demonic woman be his lady?But Mo Ling did not expose her lies, and even cooperated with her in acting.As an important member of the Demon Realm, he naturally couldn\u2019t miss out the events that led to major changes in the six realms during the battle between the Immortals and Demons, so he had also witnessed her alluring posture and appearance.That amazing glance, the instant bloom, had disappeared like smoke, and a strong blow fell on his heart.No matter what reason she had entangled herself with him, Mo Ling didn\u2019t mind.When she smiled at him like a flower, and flew into his arms like a Goddess descending on earth, Mo Ling knew that no matter what she asked for, he was willing to give it to her.Unexpectedly, she seemed to really just want to be a young couple with him.On the first night they were together, she took the initiative to put him on the bed and offered to relive his dreams.She was enthusiastic and bold, without the slightest hesitation, but he hesitated, even if his desire burned in his heart, how much he wanted to kiss her, just like in his spring dream, pressing down the girl he had seen at a glance under him, wantonly play with her warm and soft body, lingering around her.\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Mo Ling\u2019s voice trembled slightly.As a fox demon of tens of thousands of years, he was of course neither innocent nor shy, but in front of her, he felt so young and inexperienced.Ruan Jiaojiao chuckled, her beautiful smile was fascinating and enchanting. She leaned forward, her pink petal-like lips touched the boy\u2019s warm and soft lips. She pressed him on the couch and gently opened his clothes. She slowly took off her skirt, revealing her exquisite snow-white body. She lowered her eyes to look down at Mo Ling\u2019s face and rubbed her fingers on his handsome face.This fox demon was really good-looking.\u201cMo Ling\u2026\u201dRuan Jiaojiao grabbed his hand and crossed his fingers, and then took his hand to touch the snowy white circle in front of her.Mo Ling was as if bewitched by her, his fingers involuntarily kneaded on her pink hole, his thin lips kissed her silky white skin, the tip of his tongue licked the red tassel on the tip of her hole, pinching it a choke between his lips and teeth making it look appetising like red cherries.Her cheeks glowed with red blush, and the watery eyes were filled with sentimental mist. The most enchanting flower bloomed between his palms and lips and teeth, melting into a pool of spring water, allowing him to go in the depths of her body, gulping down her juices wantonly.Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s legs clamped Mo Ling\u2019s thin waist tightly, his body age remained at a young look, perhaps because men at this age have a fatal temptation and attraction to men and women.Therefore, his skin was delicate and silky, as crystal clear as mutton jade, this even made Ruan Jiaojiao a little jealous. When the two of them were entangled together, they were so white and dazzling that they could conceal the bright and vivid moon.The colour of Mo Ling\u2019s junior was matte, but the size was not inferior to anyone.The fox demon Mo Ling was a beast, and he was originally the first physical appeal between the chaos. So even if Ruan Jiaojiao was in control and took initiative at first, the two were getting better together, she was turned over as he laid down over her back, and put his hot manhood into her twat.With the most primitive posture like a wild beast, she shook her body quickly, caressed and swept hands through her body. Ruan Jiaojiao shivered by the tingling sensation as if electricity ran through her body.Mo Ling\u2019s long stick suddenly tightened, and then released in the depth of her flower hole, spraying his hot seeds, burning Jiaojiao\u2019s body which made her tremble again, and she couldn\u2019t help but groan.\u201cAh\u2026 so hot\u2026\u201dRuan Jiaojiao took a rest, she preferred her current inner body. Although she lacked spiritual power, she could instead be more involved in the joy of pure bliss.Mo Ling hugged Ruan Jiaojiao tightly in his arms. He kept kissing her every inch of her face and every inch of her skin. Because he got to release himself, he was flustered like never before. He was afraid that this was just a spring dream in his sleep. When he would wake up later, there would be no trace of what they have been doing.He was afraid that as she had suddenly appeared in front of him, she would unexpectedly disappear, not to mention that he knew her identity.\u201cJiaojiao\u2026 Jiaojiao\u2026\u201dMo Ling didn\u2019t know how to resolve the inner anxiety and restlessness. He could only release his emotions in her body over and over again through the tireless rounds. By this most intimate time spent, he was obsessed with what she gave him. He was happy to stay by her side.The ten thousand year old fox Demon, who was good at bewitching people\u2019s hearts, actually lost to a little Demon girl who was just born.No! Perhaps he should have thought of this long ago, that he would sink into her trap step by step.How could he escape her unparalleled charm, of a\u00a0 woman who could make the Immortals and Demons fight for her.\u201cJiaojiao\u2026\u201dThe undercurrent in his bright eyes was turbulent, and when he noticed the aura of the Immortal Realm, he could only hug the person in his arms tightly, not wanting her to be snatched away by anyone.\u201cOk?\u201dRuan Jiaojiao hugged Mo Ling\u2019s neck, kissed the corner of his lips, and asked with a smile in his ear.\u201cYou seem to be lost, are you in love?\u201dHaving said that, her little hand slipped into his placket, stroking his smooth skin, her red lips sucking on his lips passionately, and her little tongue entangled in his mouth fiercely.Mo Ling was a little dumbfounded, but he couldn\u2019t think about it anymore, and she responded enthusiastically to her needs before even mentioning them.Ruan Jiaojiao really liked Mo Ling. His movements were gentle and meticulous. He was not as strong and fierce as the Demon Lord and the Gods. Although women sometimes liked to pursue excitement, they were too much and turned Ruan Jiaojiao a little nauseous.However, Mo Ling was like a delicious dessert after a meal, no matter how full she was, she did not mind having a little bit more.Whether he was a big fish or a spicy stew, cake or tea, a woman loved it.The two kissed just like the water and fire using the ground as their bed and the sky as room, seeing that Luo Ya could not bear it anymore. The little girl he worked so hard to raise, and had not even tasted her yet, the boy had stolen his ripe and luscious fruit.How could this make him able to bear it? For a time Lord Luo Ya was angry, and just wanted to tear the fox demon alive.But Qingshu intended to stop him.\u201cIn what capacity do you want to come forward to stop them now, she will only hate you if you do so.\u201d God Qingshu was more sensible and could restrain his emotional impulse as compared to God Luo Ya.It was also because of this reason that he could abandon Ruan Jiaojiao in the Demon\u2019s territory and escape from death alone.Now after reincarnation, she had forgotten everything. For her, the fox Demon was her sweetheart now.God Luo Ya glanced at him ironically, and said coldly.\u201cI only know that, I miss her, I want her, I don\u2019t care about others.\u201dTLers Note:System: omooo Luo Ya, work hard, tehehe ~Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If he had died in the Demon Realm with her at that time, he could have been revived with her in reincarnation, even if he wouldn\u2019t be a God anymore.Even if she became the most ordinary person, the most humble Demon, but at least they could be an enviable pair of lovers, he looked at her with eyes filled with guilt and bitterness as he saw her making a pair with someone else.Ruan Jiaojiao and Mo Ling were about to lean their necks when they saw God Luo Ya appear in front of them, the posture of him was like a God descending into the world, interrupting their time of intimacy.\u201cMaster\u2026\u201d Ruan Jiaojiao called him timidly, but she still held Mo Ling and didn\u2019t let go.God Luo Ya felt like a heavy hammer thudded against his heart, and he was really unhappy, his ink eyes were covered with a layer of frost. He wanted to step forward to separate the two, but he could only stand in place and call her in a deep voice.\u201ccome here.\u201dRuan Jiaojiao shook her head decisively.\u201cMaster, I know everything.\u201d\u201cWhat do you know?\u201d Luo Ya frowned.\u201cYou are a God, and I am a Demon. Regardless of why the Master accepts Jiaojiao as an apprentice, Jiaojiao is grateful, but Jiaojiao will always have to return to the realm that belongs to me.\u201d Ruan Jiaojiao said righteously.Hearing this, Luo Ya was stunned.Immortals and Demons had different ways.The rules he once agreed with lay between him and her.Perhaps the Demons may not care, but as a God, he could not ignore the constraints of immortality.\u201cCome here, I can help you become a Goddess.\u201dAlthough it is difficult, even more difficult than a mortal to go to Heaven, he had tried his best to find a solution and was willing to try it out.Ruan Jiaojiao shook her head and said stubbornly.\u201cMaster, I don\u2019t want to be Immortal, I like who I am now, I feel very happy.\u201dHearing her words, the tenderness overflowing in Mo Ling\u2019s heart almost swallowed him.Yes, no matter what identity she used to be, she was willing to be with him now, he could make her happy, what else could stop them?At that moment, Mo Ling suddenly felt a pain in his back, like dense ice needles thrusting into his body, a biting chill invaded his internal organs, his throat became hot, and he spurted out a mouthful of blood.The warm liquid sprayed on Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s snow-white neck. She was stunned for a moment. Mo Ling\u2019s body shook, his complexion became pale and shaky.Ruan Jiaojiao quickly jumped forward to hold him, but she was petite with low spiritual power, and was led down by Mo Ling to the ground. She hugged him and touched her warm and red neck.Then, a thick black mist burst out of thin air, enveloping the two of them like an encircling ball. This mist was filled with a chilly breath, making people suddenly feel cold to the bones.Before Ruan Jiaojiao could react, her chin was pinched by two cold fingers, and it forced her to raise her face.What caught her eyes was the evil and handsome face of Demon Lord of the Demon Realm, with a tyrannical aura, and his eyes were full of aggressive emotions, which made people frightened.The Demon Lord\u2019s sharp and close gaze fell on her face, scrutinising her, he did not speak, thus Ruan Jiaojiao asked.\u201cWho are you and why are you hurting my husband?\u201dThe moment the Demon Lord appeared, Mo Ling was injured. The people he led simultaneously attacked Luo Ya and Qingshu, as they were caught off guard.When Luo Ya and Qingshu were out of the siege, he had already taken Ruan Jiaojiao away, and on the ground was Mo Ling who was seriously injured and dying.The Demon Lord\u2019s move was his killer move. Although Mo Ling had a ten-thousand-year cultivation base, the opponent had used a sneak attack, not to mention the difference between a Demon Lord and a normal Demon. Mo Ling was far inferior to the Demon Lord.If no one helped Mo Ling, he might be dead.On one side was Ruan Jiaojiao, who was taken away by the Demon Lord and was in a difficult situation, and on the other side was a rival in love.God Luo Ya chased after the Demon Lord without any hesitation, and God Qingshu looked at the white fox that was dying, and sighed. He was the one she loved now. If he died, she would definitely be very sad.Ruan Jiaojiao looked at the Demon Lord, who she hadn\u2019t seen for a long time, and couldn\u2019t wait to cut him a thousand times, but in her heart she secretly dug and recalled her exciting past when he had shut her down in the small black room.So when the said Demon pressed her on the cold and hard rock, she grabbed the skirt of her clothes with one hand, her face showed horror, but the corners of her lips curled a little because of the excitement that could not be restrained. The state of Ruan Jiaojiao looked contradictory and weird.Frightened?The Demon Lord secretly thought.Seeing him looking down thoughtfully, Ruan Jiaojiao didn\u2019t move further. The excitement of her reunion with her old love gradually cooled. Thinking of Mo Ling\u2019s injury, she blamed this great Demon for being too cruel.However, she knew that God Qingshu would never let him die.As the male protagonist, he was compassionate, and was full of guilt towards her, so he won\u2019t let Mo Ling have a life threatening accident.Although Ruan Jiaojiao thought that the Demon Lord would come to find her, she didn\u2019t expect that he would appear so suddenly and disturb her affairs.She was dedicated to doing side missions. After all, the points which she received were high. She really enjoyed the fun of spending points. Naturally, she would not miss this opportunity. Even if the side missions were still so frantic, at first glance they contradicted the main mission.Ruan Jiaojiao put her hand on her belly, wondering if Mo Ling\u2019s and her hard work during this period of time resulted in her pregnancy.\u201cYes, you are pregnant.\u201d The system suddenly said.Ruan Jiaojiao was surprised in an instant, but after thinking about it, something was wrong. This trash system was a pitfall for her. This time she took the initiative to open up the perspective of God without spending any of her points, the system answered her questions with its own initiative, this gave her a bad feeling.The system replied bashfully.\u201cYou have just been pregnant. With the rude and savage style of Demon Lord in love affairs, I am afraid that your baby will not be guaranteed. Good luck!\u201dRuan Jiaojiao was overjoyed at first, but when she was reminded by the system, it instantly poured cold water on her head.She bit her lip, her eyes filled with tears, and he looked at her with a deep and distinguished look. He pinched her chin with his big palm, her thin lips pressed down instantly, sharp teeth bitted her tender lips, Ruan Jiaojiao burst into tears with pain.\u201cYou promised to be a slave or a concubine for this Lord, but now you dare to go along with a stinky fox demon behind my back!\u201dRuan Jiaojiao couldn\u2019t help but shake her head three times in her mind, what was with the tone of a jealous husband catching her on the bed, coupled with his ferocious expression.If you let him know that she not only has sex with the fox demon, but also had a little fox in her belly, would that result in a good thing? Could she successfully give birth to this little fox?This was too hard! Ruan Jiaojiao sighed.The road to childbirth was too tough!TLers Note:System: Me is excited to see a little foxxie jiaojiao!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019m afraid you cannot help control yourself. What if you treat the little fox in my stomach as bad as you did the big fox!!!That\u2019s right, the side mission of this world was to make Ruan Jiaojiao give birth to a little bun. If done side by side with the main mission, it was to make the male lead like a father.The reason why Ruan Jiaojiao chose Mo Ling, the fox Demon, was that both of them were Demons, and the fecundity of a beast demon was extraordinary.Plus, because of her own personal preferences.She didn\u2019t want to give birth to a little demon, nor did she want to do it with Luo Ya cause she looked down on him. After all, he had bullied her and knocked her down to the mortal world before meeting the big pervert of the Demon Lord, she could bear a lot of grudges.The Demon Lord suddenly injected a divine sense into her mind, and the grievances and entanglements of her previous life passed through her mind like a revolving storm.What kind of ghostly feeling was this?The Demon Lord\u2019s method was really simple and rude, and quickly let her understand the matter between the two, making her want to pretend to be tricked!He also wickedly asked her to look back at the adjournment of the two people\u2019s joy, to be more precise, she was done by him in various shameful poses, just like a pipe dream, when she woke up from the dream like state, Ruan Jiaojiao still felt blood boil all over her body, and felt something damp pour out of her acupoint, making her feel sore, as if she had been fucked by him hundreds of times.\u201cYou\u2026you\u2026no\u2026 it\u2019s not me\u2026\u201dRuan Jiaojiao had to bite the bullet on her and play a trick, with an unbelievable and unacceptable expression on her face.\u201cAlthough celestial beings have the fun of being an Immortal, it\u2019s not bad to become a Demon. It\u2019s another perception of living life.\u201dThe Demon Lord stretched out the tip of his tongue and licked her lips, looking wickedly at her bare skin, as if eye-raping her.Pervert!Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s brain turned gears, thinking about how to deal with him so that he would not touch her.But she was so beautiful and sultry now, even she could not help but want to admire herself a few times!Fortunately, at the moment the Demon Lord was getting turned on, God Luo Ya chased him there in time, and the two fought together.Ruan Jiaojiao was about to slip away quietly while the two of them were not paying attention, but with who these two were, how could she have escaped from them? Thus Ruan Jiaojiao was restrained by a spell.She had to stay in place like a sculpture to watch a showdown between the two of them.The Demon Lord\u2019s murderous methods were ferocious and scheming, and God Luo Ya was obviously at a disadvantage.At that time, the rescuers from the Immortal Realm came, and Ruan Jiaojiao looked at the female lead who descended from the sky in surprise, and then listened to Lan Xue\u2019s explanation that it was God Qingshu who had sent a message to her and asked her to bring soldiers and horses to support her.As soon as the Empress heard that her niece had been found after the reincarnation, she encountered the Demon Lord again. Without a word, she immediately called the elite soldiers.This action made Lan Xue quite uncomfortable.Last time Ruan Jiaojiao had regretted that couldn\u2019t see the battle between the Immortals and the Demons in her heart, but it was suddenly staged at this moment, and was displayed before her eyes.Sure enough, Ruan Jiaojiao and the system both watched with gusto.Of course, she was able to watch the performance in such a relaxed manner thanks to the Demon Lord\u2019s blessing.Maybe he was afraid that she would be affected by the war, or maybe scared she would be snatched by people from the Immortal Realm world, so the Demon Lord sacrificed his powerful magic weapon, forming an invisible protective shield around her, isolating her from the outside world.When Mo Ling\u2019s condition was stabilised, God Qingshu had also rushed over.When he joined the battle, the two Gods of the Immortal Realm joined forces. The Demon Lord was not invincible. He was hit by the palm of the God Qingshu. The black cloak on his body was surging in the sky against the squally gale. Falling from the sky, like a falcon with its wings broken, it crashed to the ground, smashing a huge hole.Ruan Jiaojiao was just a few feet away, watching the Demon being defeated.The Demon Lord was seriously injured and knew that the tables had turned over, so he no longer wanted to fight, and quickly retreated with his men.Before leaving, he glanced at Ruan Jiaojiao with unpredictable eyes, then he waved his sleeve and retracted the artefact, Ruan Jiaojiao was released.Ruan Jiaojiao, who had regained her freedom, immediately ran towards Qingshu. God Qingshu was surprised at first, and then realised that she wanted to inquire about Mo Ling\u2019s situation, her eyes dimmed instantly.Fearing that the Demon Lord would return to kill Mo Ling and kidnap her again, Ruan Jiaojiao refused to leave the unconscious Mo Ling for half a step, so the two were taken to the Immortal Realm together and well protected.Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s original Xianju <sup>1</sup> System: In Chinese, xian means \u201ccelestial spirit,\u201d and ju means \u201cdwelling place.\u201d Xianju was named \u201cdwelling place of celestial spirits\u201d due to its natural beauty. Xianju County ( Chinese: \u4ed9\u5c45\u53bf; pinyin: Xi\u0101nj\u016b Xi\u00e0n Tai-chow dialect: Sin-k\u00fc Y\u00f6n) is a county of Zhejiang, China. was still there. The Empress used to see these things present and thought about her from time to time, and had ordered servants to come and clean her place often. Unfortunately, she had come back now, but she was no longer the same person.She was not a Goddess, but a Demon with low spiritual power, who lived here temporarily and won\u2019t stay long.The Empress saw her poor niece and held her in her tears. Ruan Jiaojiao had remembered the old things about her life because of the Demon Lord\u2019s spells, so she comforted her aunt softly, saying that she was fine now, and she was also very happy even if she was not a Goddess\u2026The Empress\u2019s thoughts were the same as those of Qingshu, and wanted her to practice Dao again and get the chance to return to the Immortal Realm, but Ruan Jiaojiao firmly declined.\u201cAuntie, I\u2026I\u2019m pregnant.\u201dShe had flushed cheeks, dropped a bomb shyly, her eyes looked at her belly with tenderness.That\u2019s it.While the Empress was shocked, she was also clear-minded.\u201cLet me meet that kid.\u201dThe Empress knew that after the reincarnation of her niece, she was in love with a fox demon. Although she was not very satisfied with the marriage, she knew that her right to interfere with her affairs were gone. Moreover, her niece had been so miserable and dejected in her previous life. She only hoped that she would be happy in this life .Mo Ling healed his injury. As a ten thousand year old fox demon, even if he could walk around in the Demon Realm freely, everyone in the Immortal Realm had their eyes on him. Although he was grateful to them for saving himself, Mo Ling was not willing to stay here and be under their watchful gaze.Seeing the Empress, he knew that the other party was Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s aunt. Facing the elders, he knew exactly what attitude he should adopt to please them.The Empress agreed to the marriage of the two.The fetus was secretly knotted, and the children already in love were present, what else could she say!It was also at that time that Mo Ling learned that Ruan Jiaojiao was pregnant with his child. He was ecstatic, swept all his thoughts away, and only felt that he was the happiest person in the world.Someone was proud, however others were frustrated.God Qingshu and God Luo Ya almost couldn\u2019t process the fact that she was pregnant, even the lingering atmosphere around the Immortal Realm was depressing and dull, making the others fearful.Lan Xue was extremely happy when she heard the news.What about her return to the Immortal Realm, after all, she will return to the Demon Realm with her husband and live with her kids and husband, she would never need to live in her shadow again.TLers Note:System: Lan Xue, oh poor Lan XuePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Do you remember the celestial banquet, you took me to the mortal realm, in that cave, we were in water day and night, lingering in with our bodies intimate.\u201d\u201cIt has been a long time ago, and besides, it\u2019s still a matter of the previous life, what else would I do by recalling them.\u201d Ruan Jiaojiao looked cold.\u201cIt was the last life for you, not for me!\u201d Luo Ya was suddenly excited. He abruptly kissed her lips, thrusting his tongue into her mouth and stirring around, Ruan Jiaojiao was forced to accept his strong kiss. .He didn\u2019t pay much attention to skills, his tongue swept away in her mouth wantonly, and her tears overflowed from the corner of her eyes.Motherfucker! Having weak spiritual power was annoying!Ruan Jiaojiao was almost suffocated by his kiss and struggled desperately before Luo Ya let go. She waved her hand and slapped him without hesitation.With a \u201cpop\u201d, he could have dodged, but he still voluntarily got slapped by her.Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s palm hurt and her eyes were swollen red. Her looks fell into Luo Ya\u2019s eyes. The tears in her eyes were almost brimming to the rims, and it looked even more beautiful. It made his blood boil and ran through his body. It disassembled into the abdomen.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you are angry with me or hate me, but I won\u2019t allow you to leave me! Obviously\u2026obviously\u2026\u201dGod Luo Ya wanted to say that the two were the first to be together, the first to have a skin relationship, but after all, that was a matter of her previous life for her, and she could immediately refute it.So he swallowed back, dragged Ruan Jiaojiao and left without paying attention to the mortal world.God Luo Ya brought Ruan Jiaojiao to the cave where the two people shared such a private memory. Although the mortal world had changed and so did the people, the quiet cave still maintained its original appearance.Ruan Jiaojiao covered her abdomen with her hands, looked at Luo Ya warily, and said solemnly.\u201cWhy did you bring me here?!\u201dLuo Ya\u2019s gaze also fell on her slightly bulged belly, and he pulled out a wry smile.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t touch it, as long as you are obedient and behave.\u201dRuan Jiaojiao saw that God Luo Ya was going crazy. She thought that the ex-innocent virgin was really fragile, and he couldn\u2019t bear this little stimulation.When God Qingshu took Mo Ling to find her, he saw Luo Ya pressing Ruan Jiaojiao onto the ground.The hideous organ under his crotch was coming in and out of her flower hole, while Ruan Jiaojiao closed her eyes and her face was full of tears. She covered her belly with one hand as if she was trying to protect her baby. At the same time, she bit her lips white and tried her best to endure. Like she was trying to bear humiliation.Seeing this scene, both of them had their eyes popped open.Mo Ling even rushed forward, trying to beat Luo Ya hard.However, God Luo Ya was obviously stunned. Seeing someone approaching, his eyes were scarlet and vicious. God Qingshu saw that his condition was not right, and only wanted to stop him, Mo Ling had already turned his palm into a sharp claw. He took it out and wanted to poke through Luo Ya, but in a jiffy the whole man was dripping with blood.\u201cMo Ling!\u201dRuan Jiaojiao couldn\u2019t help screaming when she saw such a bloody scene.God Qingshu struggled to contain Luo Ya. At that time, God Luo Ya burst into a black mist, revealing a cold air which Ruan Jiaojiao was no stranger to.Wait! Something was wrong!!!\u201cHe is turning into a demon, this is dangerous! You should go!\u201d God Qingshu sternly said to her.Ruan Jiaojiao hugged Mo Ling.\u201cI will not go!!!\u201dHow could she leave her unborn child\u2019s father!Mo Ling had a big hole in his mouth, and the red blood gurgled out like a spring. Upon seeing that, Ruan Jiaojiao quickly took out an elixir given to her by the Empress and stuffed it into Mo Ling\u2019s mouth.The empress lost her niece once, and finally found her back, so she gave her the precious elixir of life extension.But the pill could not be swallowed by Mo Ling, so Ruan Jiaojiao opened his mouth and stuck her tongue in to help him swallow the pill into his stomach.The power of a God who had fallen into a Demon path was very terrifying. God Qingshu had been struggling a bit to deal with Luo Ya, and when Luo Ya saw Ruan Jiaojiao holding Mo Ling\u2019s lips and teeth in an intimate and entangled kiss, he was full of jealousy. Turning inward, his anger was high, and he wanted to tear the Mo Ling who had robbed him of his love with a sharp knife to pieces.Being stimulated, Luo Ya\u2019s cultivation soared instantly, defeating God Qingshu in one swoop, and after wounding him, he rushed towards Mo Ling that Ruan Jiaojiao was protecting.\u201cNo, don\u2019t!!!\u201dSeeing that Luo Ya was about to attack Mo Ling again, Mo Ling, who was already seriously injured, could never stand his attack, so Ruan Jiaojiao protected Mo Ling under her body, trying to block Luo Ya\u2019s move filled with killing intent with her body.Luo Ya realised that she would rather die to protect the fox demon, and was instantly knocked out of consciousness by her actions. Qingshu took advantage of his dazedness and gathered the energy in his whole body to hit him with his palm. The spiritual power of Luo Ya rioted, and his body fell down being unsupported, and thumped to the ground on one knee.Luo Ya was hit by a single blow. Ruan Jiaojiao and God Qingshu both breathed a sigh of relief. Qingshu was just about to step forward and stop him, when Luo Ya suddenly lifted his lips and smiled, demonic and evil, just as usual. It\u2019s like they were two completely different people.Ruan Jiaojiao was startled, God Qingshu secretly said something was wrong.\u201cHe is being controlled by someone using spiritism!\u201dLuo Ya attacked Mo Ling again, ignoring Qingshu who was not far behind him, and that he could use his ultimate move from behind to get his life.\u201cIf you like this fox demon so much, then you go to death with him! The only unfortunate thing is that I will have to find your reincarnation again!!!\u201dLuo Ya suddenly conjured a deep and long ice sword in his hand, and pierced the two people embracing on the ground.At the crucial moment, Mo Ling suddenly used his arm to spin Ruan Jiaojiao, blocking Luo Ya\u2019s sword with his back.However, Luo Ya\u2019s sword intended to pierce both of them, and ten percent of the spiritual cultivation base was inserted in that sword, as if to kill the fish and break the net, and die with the two.Ruan Jiaojiao only felt a sharp pain in her chest. She looked down, and when the ice blade penetrated Mo Ling\u2019s mouth, two inches of it pierced her heart.The thick heat of the blood\u00a0 and the cold of the ice sword were mixed, but at the moment only Mo Ling was in her eyes.He held her face in both hands and smiled slightly at her with his charming and charming face, which made her feel stunned for a while.She had always known that this fox demon looked good, but she did not expect to look so good. For the first time, Ruan Jiaojiao felt her heart throb and ache. The blood of the fox demon was injected into her heart and melted together.Mo Ling\u2019s normally warm palms were cold at that time, touching her cheeks with gentle movements, Ruan Jiaojiao watched his handsome face magnify in front of him, he leaned over and kissed her lips, when she noticed a pill was pushed into her mouth by his flexible tongue, she unconsciously swallowed it down her throat with the saliva of the two.\u201cLady Ruan Jiaojiao, give birth to our child and raise him well.\u201dHis cold palm slipped off her cheeks, Ruan Jiaojiao felt hot in her eyes, she reached out and touched it, and her hand was wet.The system asked curiously.\u201cHost, are you really crying?\u201dRuan Jiaojiao ignored it, and looked at Luo Ya who was lying not far away.When he attacked the two of them just now, in order to stop him, God Qingshu had to attack him on the back. Luo Ya had concentrated all his spiritual power on the attack intending to kill the two of them, leaving no share for his defence, thus he suffered by Qingshu\u2019s palm, his body couldn\u2019t bear that huge loss.The Immortal collapsed, the mad God Luo Ya seemed to have recovered his mind, his eyes were clear and vibrant, and he reached out to Ruan Jiaojiao.Ruan Jiaojiao watched Mo Ling in her arms drift away as a wisp of blue smoke. It was his soul heading towards the underworld, leaving only the corpse of a white fox on the ground.She put down the white fox and walked towards Luo Ya. The tears on her face were still wet and present, with her face expressionless.\u201cYou killed my child\u2019s dad.\u201d Her tone was cold, her eyes trembling cold.\u201cSorry.\u201dLuo Ya could only barely squeeze out these three words <sup>1</sup> System: Three words in Chinese, however one in English. . He was unable to explain his actions, he was accused of being a murderer, but anger and jealousy were his own true emotions, however they were intensified by those who wanted to use them.Ruan Jiaojiao looked at Luo Ya and walked towards him. At that moment, she stood upright, condescendingly watching him, like a noble queen who was looking down at an ant.God Luo Ya suddenly remembered the first time the two of them had met. At that time, he wanted to teach her a lesson, relying on his cultivation base to easily knock her down to the mortal world.At that time, he was standing above the clouds, watching her like this, falling down.It was not that he was not reported, the time had not yet come.Luo Ya suddenly thought of this sentence, a little dumbfounded.Was it a fate between the two of them? He originally thought that he would be happy for the enemy, and finally he could cultivate a righteous result.Why has it become an arena now?One step wrong leads to a wrong outcome, maybe he was wrong at the very beginning.I will give you a gift as compensation, which is the last thing I can do for you.He looked at Ruan Jiaojiao and reached out to her.Ruan Jiaojiao looked at Luo Ya, a dignified God, and finally his energy died, he was also pitiful, she squatted down and let him hold his hand, and he took the opportunity to wrap her fingers tightly with both hands tightly clasped together.At that time, she felt a powerful and terrifying spiritual power flooding into her limbs, and her weary body was relieved, and all the pain present in her body was completely dissipated.God Luo Ya suddenly seemed to have been drained of spiritual power, his face was ashen as a paper, and then his whole person turned into a plume of blue smoke, floating away from Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s fingertips, without a trace in an instant.God Luo Ya was gone, there were no more words spoken, leaving no trace of him.God Qingshu accompanied Ruan Jiaojiao to the place where she and Mo Ling first met, and buried the white fox there.The two returned to the Immortal Realm and reported the matter to the Emperor of Heaven.A God fell, and was controlled by a Demon, the evil forces secretly messed up and moved unthinkingly, and it was bound to cause an uproar between the celestial beings.They were afraid that the peace between the Immortal and Realm realms would be soon broken, and a bloody storm would set off within the six realms.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It had saved the hardships and difficulties and uncertain worries on the road to the Tao and became an Immortal directly.This was unprecedented.After all, no God was willing to give away their cultivation for nothing, and throughout the ages, not many people in the Immortal Realm could become Gods, one could count it with their fingers.The Gods were all aloft, standing in the sky and clouds, an existence that mortals couldn\u2019t touch.The people in the Immortal Realm were quite embarrassed. On the one hand, the fall of a high God was a great loss for the Immortals. On the other hand, it was the infatuation of the high God Luo Ya. It was a pity that Luo Ya had no intention of restraining himself. As for Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s fox demon husband, there was no one who mentioned it.But because of the fetus in her belly, Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s identity had become a bit embarrassing for them.She had become an Immortal, but the fetus was half-immortal and half-demon. If she stayed in the Immortal Realm, what about such an alternative existence?The Empress was quite distressed about this, she wanted to persuade her niece not to have this child, but seeing Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s wholehearted fatal relief, she couldn\u2019t bring herself to say it.I think she and the fox demon also have feelings. If this posthumous child is also abandoned, I am afraid that others will say Jiaojiao is indifferent and ruthless.The Supreme God Qingshu asked to see the Empress, and wanted her to marry Jiaojiao to him as his wife.The Empress was naturally surprised and astonished at the request of the Supreme God Qingshu.\u201cIs God Qingshu feeling guilty and wanting to make up for what happened before?\u201d The Empress\u2019s expression sank.She would definitely not agree to compensation by marriage events.And because he left Jiaojiao alone in the Demon Realm, causing Jiaojiao to commit suicide by humiliation, the Empress also had a grudge against the God Qingshu.Women were more emotional, even if she could understand for what reason he took this action, she still felt resentful.\u201cNo. I love Jiaojiao. I really want to marry her. I want to give her and her children happiness and protection. Please allow me.\u201dThe High God Qingshu was usually cold and reticent, and even if you were the Emperor and the Empress, he had to give three points of courtesy. Therefore, the Empress has never seen him so low-pitched and humble and sincere.The empress thought this would be the best of both worlds.Jiaojiao had to raise the child by herself. Although she had her aunt to rely on, there were always aspects that could not be taken care of. If she were to find her a husband to be with Jiaojiao, it would be fine.Moreover, given the status of the Supreme God Qingshu in the immortal world, the child had such a father to rely on, and she wouldn\u2019t have to be afraid that the child would be an orphan and her niece a widow who would be made irresponsible or insulting remarks about.Although the Empress\u2019s attitude had softened, she thought that Jiaojiao\u2019s thoughts were the most important in such a matter. She was afraid that she would be unwilling, so she immediately sent someone to call Jiaojiao over.In order to persuade her, the Empress thought of a lot of painstaking words, but when Ruan Jiaojiao heard of her purpose, she readily agreed.This\u2026\u2026The Empress was left stunned, and then thought about it, it seemed that the niece had secretly promised her heart to God Qingshu before, and the two had then experienced the catastrophe in the demon\u2019s hands again. It appeared that the children had love between them. Now, the marriage could be considered wonderful.It was a pity that Jiaojiao was pregnant with the fox demon\u2019s child, but the said person, God Qingshu, didn\u2019t mind, she was naturally happy to see this happen.So the Empress immediately decided on the marriage. She could wait, but the fetus in Jiaojiao\u2019s belly couldn\u2019t, she couldn\u2019t let her get pregnant with a big belly.Choosing the day is worse than hitting the day. The Empress asked the diviner to do the divination and chose the nearest auspicious day.Lan Xue heard the good news that God Qingshu was about to marry Ruan Jiaojiao as his wife.With a \u201cbang\u201d, the tea tray she was holding fell to the ground and broke into pieces.She ignored the strange eyes of the maidservants next to her, holding on to the edge of the table, her beautiful face instantly turned pale, even slightly distorted.How could this be?Did God Qingshu know that she is pregnant with the fox demon\u2019s seed, and still wanted to marry her as his wife?Lan Xue only felt that a bucket of ice water poured down her head, extinguishing all her illusions.She originally thought that God Qingshu would definitely give up on that woman. Her original jealousy and resentment were dissipated because of pity for Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s dead husband, and sympathy for her to bring up a child by herself, but when she heard the news, she only thought she was extremely ridiculous.Lan Xue felt this was unbelievable but she had to accept it. She was unwilling, so she turned around and ran towards the Immortal Palace of the Supreme God Qingshu, regardless of what he was doing, and regardless of the whispers and ridicule of the Goddesses behind her.Before she arrived at the Immortal Palace of God Qingshu, she first met Ruan Jiaojiao on the way.\u201cYou\u2026you\u2026how can you be so cheeky?!\u201d She pointed at Ruan Jiaojiao, and asked with envy.Ruan Jiaojiao didn\u2019t even look at her, she was planning to go around Lan Xue and walk again.Who knows what this woman will do when she is crazy, she is not alone now, in case the female lead gets excited and pushes her, she doesn\u2019t want to stage a bloody tragedy again.Seeing Ruan Jiaojiao looking at her as if she was nothing but air, Lan Xue only thought she looked down upon herself, as if she had been humiliated, her face flushed and she roared without a word.\u201cDo you think you are still that arrogant Goddess?! You are just a\u2026\u201dJust as Lan Xue was about to scold her with unpleasant words, her neck suddenly tightened, as if she was pinched tightly, and within half a syllable, her mouth was suffocated like a boulder, and felt as if she was dying. The pain made her sweat all over.Just when she thought she was really going to die, the horrible feeling suddenly disappeared, it was like she had hallucinations, but the feeling of being pinched on the neck was too deep, and she now had lingering fears, breathing heavily and panting badly.She thought it was Ruan Jiaojiao who caused her to feel this ghostly feeling, and became even more angry. When she stared at her fiercely, she found that God Qingshu was standing next to her, looking at her with an indifferent and cold look staring at her.Lan Xue instantly felt that her back was crawled over by a snake, and the swish cold invaded her inside.\u201cNo matter how nonsensuous you are, you will never be able to speak to her like this.\u201dThe Qingshu God\u2019s thin lips did not move, but his cold voice rang in her ears.Lan Xue\u2019s legs softened, and she knelt down on the ground with a thud. The embarrassment she had never felt swept across her, she lowered her head and covered her face.Oh yo~ he looks so handsome!Ruan Jiaojiao sighed in her heart, but did not show it on her face, snorted coldly, and walked away.She had a graceful posture, not the least awkwardly walking like a pregnant woman, she was still light and slim, and she was beautiful from the back too.The gaze of the God Qingshu focused on her. After she disappeared after a while, he never moved his eyes, let alone look at the poorly crying Lan Xue, who covered her face and sobbed.For the wedding, the Emperor was extremely extravagant, and even the Immortals far away in South China came to congratulate the pair.After all, a God was marrying a wife. That was a rare event which was celebrated once in a thousand years, the Immortal Realm was full of joy, and the atmosphere was extremely lively.However, the air between Ruan Jiaojiao and God Qingshu was a bit cold, especially the bride, with no smile on her face, calm as water, and no shyness or sweetness in her eyes, and those who know the pair\u2019s inner feelings dare not break open their mouths.The two formed an immortal couple in this weird state.The wedding night was arranged in the bridal chamber.Only envy mandarin duck but not the immortal <sup>1</sup> System: a common saying which means to envy mandarin ducks for being together hand-in-hand until old, accompanying each other all their lives, and as long as they have this, they won\u2019t even want to become an immortal of the heavens. the following phrase means that this immortal became a mandarin duck so according to logic, his happiness should be bubbling over since he\u2019s a mandarin duck + an immortal , this immortal became a mandarin duck so it stands to reason that he should be bubbling with happiness.But Ruan Jiaojiao didn\u2019t care about the newlyweds ceremony, she took off her clothes early and was ready to rest.She was raising a baby now, so she couldn\u2019t drink and stay up late, and it was natural for her to not have sex too.God Qingshu walked to the bed and looked at Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s exquisitely undulating figure, he lifted the quilt, laid down, and embraced the charming person who made him toss and turn in his dreams.\u201cWell\u2026\u201dRuan Jiaojiao slept soundly. She didn\u2019t expect that God Qingshu would be so bored that he would be a beast without saying a word. It seemed that he was really planning to have a talk with her, but she turned her face around and refused.\u201cNo!\u201dNo matter how God Qingshu cared about her, he had made up his mind to linger around with her. He had accumulated his desires for so long, and his suppressed emotions desperately needed to be vented. He kissed her soft and delicate lips firmly and sniffed the sultry fragrance on her body.Her taste was so sweet, so beautiful that he was willing to die for her at that moment!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019m afraid that God Qingshu would become the object of private ridicule in the celestial world.The burning light in his eyes suddenly dimmed, and Qingshu\u2019s face also darkened a bit.God Qingshu stood silently beside the bed for a long time, and Ruan Jiaojiao apparently entered the sweet dreamland again, sleeping peacefully.She seemed to be talking in a dream, Qingshu could hear her clearly.Mo Ling\u2026Only these two words.She dreamed of the fox demon, so her lips curled in her dream and her smile was sweet.God Qingshu suddenly wanted to wake her up, and wanted to madly force her to disperse the fox demon\u2019s figure in her mind, leaving her only with him in her whole body, but he remembered the threat she said again.She had said that she would move back to her xianju to sleep if he touched her again.God Qingshu tried to suppress all his gloomy emotions and lay on the bed.Even if they slept together, they had different dreams in the same bed.The wife seemed to have another man in her heart, and had a private meeting with that man in her dream. Not only that, she also had the seed of that man in her belly, but he had to accept all this.Who made him owe her?But he knew very well that apart from guilt, there was a deeper love for her.Yes, in addition to trying to compensate her, he still loved her.Maybe it was her petite body that tried to protect him, or maybe it was because of the time in the dungeon where she dedicated herself to double cultivation with him without hesitation. He couldn\u2019t forget the taste of being in the dark demon realm with her. \u2026And he watched the moment when she was bullied and was held powerless by the Demon Lord, his pride was ravaged and his self-esteem was trampled to pieces. As the God of the Gods, he had never experienced that kind of emotion after his tens of thousands of years of practice. During the intense ups and downs, no one has ever made him feel like she brought him.Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s belly grew bigger day by day, however she didn\u2019t feel any uncomfortable feelings. There was no lack of the Empress\u2019s care and love, and she had been awarded many elixir magic weapons.For her, the God Qingshu travelled all over the realms, searching for all kinds of rare treasures for her, just to make her laugh.Ruan Jiaojiao successfully gave birth to a baby boy.This child had completely inherited the beauty of his parents, and he had a face that brought disaster to the world as soon as he was born, which simply reversed the attitudes of all beings in the Immortal Realm.Especially the Empress, who couldn\u2019t wait to take this baby with her every day, when someone held the little baby in their hands, he smiled at you very sweetly, it made people feel so happy.Soon even the Emperor of heaven fell, and he could not wait to give all the treasures to this little treasure for fun.Ruan Jiaojiao couldn\u2019t get used to her motherhood, and this child was also very clever, and almost pleased everyone in the Immortal Realm. But she was still the most favoured.\u201cGood little raccoon, mother will leave for a while.\u201dRuan Jiaojiao squeezed her son\u2019s small face, and the pink and tender cheeks were really admirable.The child blinked his clear eyes, grabbed Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s skirt and refused to let go. Although he was favoured by so many people in the celestial world, he was the most sticky thing towards his mother.\u201cMother, where are you going?\u201d His voice was sweet.Ruan Jiaojiao hugged this cute little dumpling and whispered to him in a soft voice. Both mother and son enjoyed the intimacy.Especially when God Qingshu was there, Xiao Li\u2019s attitude towards this cheap father was like that of a love rival, entwining Ruan Jiaojiao like an octopus, and had also thrown a tantrum that she must sleep in the middle of the bed, not giving Qingshu any face.\u201cI\u2019m going to find your father.\u201d Ruan Jiaojiao kissed Xiao Li\u2019s face and rubbed the fluffy silk like skin on his body.It is actually good to be a celestial mother. You don\u2019t need to suffer from mortal sufferings at all. Feed a few elixirs, and the baby\u2019s spiritual intelligence will be opened.\u201cMy dad?\u201d The expressionless solemn face of God Qingshu came in the little raccoon\u2019s mind, and he glanced at his mom.Although no one had mentioned his life experience to him, he was born at odds with God Qingshu.He is not like his son, and I\u2019m not like a Laozi.The two were polite and extremely hypocritical.Ruan Jiaojiao didn\u2019t explain too much, but just told the child that she was going to leave the Immortal Realm for a period of time, so that he should take good care of himself and find his cheap father if he had something to do.Ruan Jiaojiao left after the mother and son were tired and separated reluctantly.So when God Qingshu couldn\u2019t see his lady anywhere, he had to ask the little raccoon who was playing happily in the pile of magic weapons just rewarded by the Emperor.Xiao Li lazily lifted his eyelids and said casually.\u201cMother said she will be away for a while.\u201dGod Qingshu\u2019s heart suddenly thumped, and a bad feeling arose.\u201cDid she say where she was going?\u201dThe little raccoon raised his head, raised his lips and smiled, faintly showing the charm of the fox demon Mo Ling.\u201cFather, you, the husband doesn\u2019t know how would I know.\u201dAfter that, he lowered his head and continued to play with those dazzling magic weapons.God Qingshu was no longer able to bother about this child, he turned around and left, but he did not expect that the little raccoon dropped his play hub and grabbed his robe.\u201cFather, if you are going to find mother, take me with you.\u201dHow could God Qingshu beat this little fox, so he could only lead him.When Qingshu was in a hurry, Lan Xue suddenly rushed out, blocking the path of the father and son.For this woman, Xiao Li had no good liking by nature, and even had strong hostility, mainly because Lan Xue looked at him with contempt.\u201cI know where she has gone, are you sure you really want to find her?\u201d Lan Xue\u2019s expression was a little weird.TLers Note:System: What to do?

Don\u2019t kill her!Since the wedding of God Qingshu and Ruan Jiaojiao, Lan Xue\u2019s situation in the Immortal Realm had become more and more difficult, and even the maidservants ridiculed her right in front of her face.Before God Luo Ya died, he had also given all his cultivation base to Ruan Jiaojiao, so that she could directly obtain the righteous path and return to her position of being a Goddess without any effort, even the spiritual powers were far above her. How could she swallow this? She felt unwilling.She, Ruan Jiaojiao was reborn again. Not only did she get the cultivation base of God Luo Ya, she also married God Qingshu with the child of the fox demon, and even the wild species she gave birth to, the Emperor and all the celestial beings in the realm favoured him. This incredible behaviour made Lan Xue jealous and crazy.So she secretly paid attention to Ruan Jiaojiao, trying to catch her.If Ruan Jiaojiao died on her impulse before, then she now wants to destroy her by herself.Sometimes women were such weird creatures, they would sympathise when the other person was in a bad situation, but if the other person leaves herself far behind and steps on her feet, they can\u2019t wait to drag the person down from the high cloud.So when Lan Xue secretly followed Ruan Jiaojiao and found out where she was going, she was ecstatic.When Lan Xue showed up in front of Ruan Jiaojiao with God Qingshu and Xiao Li, she was nestling in the arms of a young man with red eyes and red lips and white teeth.Seeing the man, Xiao Li felt an indescribable familiar feeling in his heart. Perhaps the man\u2019s eyebrows were somewhat similar to his own.His appearance was more like his mother, but there were also some features that were not similar to her. Although God Qingshu was nominally his father, from the perspective of Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s attitude towards him and his attitude towards himself, Xiao Li was smart for his age. He had speculated that there was something else hidden in his life experience.Though, when he asked the Empress, the Empress precluded him as a child.His mother had said she was going to find his father, and the moment he saw this man, Xiao Li understood.However, the young man was still wagging three fluffy tails behind him. It was obvious that he was just a little demon with a low level of cultivation, and none of the tails was completely incarnate.So his father is a fox demon?Xiao Li thought of his nominal father, God Qingshu had a lofty status and boundless spiritual powers, even if he looked through the entire Immortal Realm, he was one of the best, everyone respected him, but he just can\u2019t make himself like him.And seeing the fox demon, the little raccoon was not only not disappointed, but felt close.Ruan Jiaojiao saw the three people who suddenly appeared in front of her, taking the complex expressions of God Qingshu and Lan Xue\u2019s unkindness into her eyes, she did nothing but waved to Xiao Li without caring.\u201cBaby, come here.\u201dThe little raccoon immediately flew into his mother\u2019s arms, coquettishly rolling and rubbing.After the reincarnation of the fox demon Mo Ling, he accepted the fact that an Immortal lady came to find him in his previous life, he also quickly acknowledged that he had a baby.Seeing the happy and loving scene of a family of three playing in front of her eyes, Lan Xue glanced at God Qingshu with sympathy. Seeing that he had not come forward to question, she opened her mouth to break the embarrassing situation.\u201cGoddess, no matter how unforgettable your old love is, don\u2019t forget that your current husband is the God Qingshu. You agreed to marry him at the beginning, not the Demon, Mo Ling, marrying you as his wife. Since you are already married, how can you play around like this? Can you love two people?\u201dRuan Jiaojiao raised her eyebrows, and responded unhurriedly.\u201cIt\u2019s up to you what you think. I don\u2019t need you to fight for injustice for us. Why\u2026 Do you hope he doesn\u2019t want me and will marry you in the future?\u201dUnexpectedly, she was so shameless that she would speak so bluntly, perhaps with a little bit of embarrassment she had dismantled into anger, Lan Xue directly shouted furiously.\u201cAnyway, you are undoubtedly betraying God Qingshu by doing this!\u201dFacing Lan Xue\u2019s anger, Ruan Jiaojiao was always calm and cool, she didn\u2019t seem to put the female lead in her eyes. Lan Xue immediately turned her gaze to God Qingshu, hoping to get a little reaction from him, but she was left disappointed.The supreme God Qingshu lowered his eyes, said a few words, turned around and left.\u201cIf you have had enough fun, come back to the Immortal Realm, I will wait for you at home.\u201dHearing that, Lan Xue\u2019s eyes almost popped out, and it was hard for her to believe that this man with an almost humble and persuasive posture would be the God Qingshu of the Immortal Realm, who is above all in her mind and cannot be touched.\u201cWait\u2026\u201dWhen Lan Xue saw that God Qingshu had really left without looking back, she looked at Ruan Jiaojiao. She carelessly held the fox demon and snuggled against him, while the little kid looked at him curiously. His real father, or his mother\u2019s lover.They seem to be enjoying the warm and sweet time of a family of three, it was as if no one else could bother them, it was too much!Lan Xue bit her lip, her nails clenched against her palms, and immediately went to chase after God Qingshu, but where she could get the other\u2019s spiritual trace, Qingshu was long gone by the time she wanted to go after him.She was really unwilling, and was ready to fly back to the Immortal Realm, and immediately reported the matter to the Emperor, she at the same time promoted Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s unruly attitude and shamelessness in the Immortal Realm!When Lan Xue had just flown into the air, she suddenly became frozen and unable to move. In the blink of an eye, a thick black mist enveloped her, and the cold breath instantly penetrated her limbs, making her feel like three souls and seven spirits were tearing out of her body.She tried her best to struggle, but her neck was pinched by a palm in the black mist. Because of suffocation, her beautiful face was a bit hideous, and the handsome and innocent face of the man who trapped her gradually became clear.Lan Xue was in trance for a moment. The man\u2019s appearance was distinguishable from the God Qingshu, and he even had to win some points in appearance, however God Qingshu had a cold temperament, but this man was very evil.The Demon Lord!Ruan Jiaojiao was planning to deepen her relationship with Mo Ling when he had reincarnated, when she suddenly heard an alarm from the system.\u201cQuick! Go and save the female lead!! She is dying!!\u201dRuan Jiaojiao was taken aback, and then reacted, Lan Xue was dying, what did she do?The system shouted quickly.\u201cStupid! You can use spells now!!! Go! If you don\u2019t go, it will be too late!!\u201dMotherfu*ker! If you scold Laozi <sup>1</sup> System: An arrogant way to refer to yourself. , Laozi is not going!!!Ruan Jiaojiao reached out and touched Mo Ling\u2019s face, causing his jade-like face to become squished.The young man\u2019s facial features were very beautiful, with red lips and white teeth, so tender that it seemed she could pinch water out, causing her heart to ripple. Thinking about it, she was stunned as she realised she hadn\u2019t eaten it for a long time as she was in a cold war with Qingshu\u2026The system sneered.\u201cIf you don\u2019t go to save her, the world will collapse. If a world collapses, the next task will be twice as difficult. The randomly selected task objects may all be ugly, bald and wretched uncles.\u201dAs soon as the system\u2019s voice fell, Ruan Jiaojiao kissed Mo Ling, and at the same time stuffed the little raccoon who was stunned by her technique into his arms.\u201cTake good care of our children, I have a bit of an urgent issue to deal with right now, I\u2019ll be back when I am done!\u201dIn an instant, Ruan Jiaojiao had already appeared at the scene of the Demon Lord killing Lan Xue, and she called out.\u201cHold on! Don\u2019t kill her!\u201dThe Demon Lord palm loosened and Lan Xue fell softly to the ground.Ruan Jiaojiao glanced at her condition and stroked her chest with a sigh of relief. Fortunately, she caught up with them. After all she didn\u2019t want to fall in love with an ugly man.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After all, in his eyes, this woman was a rival in love to her, and she had gone against and confronted her many times, and even spurred and stimulated her to die once.This question was a bit complicated\u2026Ruan Jiaojiao blinked, and said shamelessly.\u201cBecause I am a celestial being, all Immortals are supposed to be kind-hearted, so I don\u2019t think she is guilty of death.\u201dThe Demon sneered, and in a flash, he stood in front of her, stretched out his long arms and hugged her. Touching her cheek with his big palm, his eyes seemed soft? !\u201cYou people in the Immortal Realm are really hypocritical.\u201d his fingertips rubbed her soft lips. Although his voice sounded ironic, there was no expression on his face while looking at her.To be honest, Ruan Jiaojiao was shocked at the time. In her impression, the man never had shown such a gentle attitude.It felt like God Luo Ya had turned into a demon, and that day it was judged that Luo Ya behaved as two different people. If something went wrong, behind it was the hand of a demon, so the demon is evil, was he still a good person?In other words, why did he want to kill Lan Xue?\u201cWhy do you want to kill her?\u201d Ruan Jiaojiao asked back.Ruan Jiaojiao thought, with the style of the Demon Lord, it stands to reason that if you catch a Goddess with good looks like Lan Xue, even if you don\u2019t enjoy her, it\u2019s not bad to catch it back to Demon Realm and let his subordinates ravage her.Is it to avenge her?He did not answer her question, but pinched her chin and stared deeper into her eyes.Ruan Jiaojiao caught a flicker of fondness to her astonishment?\u201cYou\u2026\u201d She was a little bit sceptical.Did he take the wrong medicine? Could it be that feelings sprouted in him after playing with her so many times?\u201cDo not talk.\u201dHe seemed to think that her words were too long and would ruin the atmosphere, so he leaned down and lowered her head, his thin and cold lips catching her slightly red ones.This\u2026Ruan Jiaojiao was left speechless by the passionate kiss of his, not to mention, the unruly temperament of the Demon Lord was quite fascinating, and she couldn\u2019t help but immerse herself in this domineering side which leaked tenderness.When he let go of Ruan Jiaojiao, her cheeks were flushed, her eyes were filled with mist, and her pink lips were even more ruddy as a rose by the kiss, which made blood rush to his brain and wanted to press her down immediately. Flip her body, and slam his meat stick into her tight, hot and humid honeycomb, wanting to savour the taste of her wantonly.After the gentle lingering kiss, letting him lie on the ice bed alone again, made him feel unspeakably depressed.He also tried to find that kind of taste in other women, but no matter what kind of beauty with a jade like body stood in front of him, it was not pleasing to him in any way.The Demon Lord had also asked his envoy why it was like this, however the other party\u2019s eyes widened and almost dropped his chin.\u201cLord\u2026 Your lord\u2026 You like someone.\u201dlike?He wondered, it didn\u2019t feel bad. He originally wanted to forget it, but he couldn\u2019t erase the scene of her dying in front of him.He wanted to trap her by his side and imprison her, but if her heart was unwilling, he didn\u2019t want just her body trapped inside.So he changed his way, he took revenge for her and fulfilled her wish.God Luo Ya, who had acted on her at the beginning, was the first one who took the brunt, and the woman who got in the way\u2026Thinking of this, the Demon Lord glanced at Lan Xue who was limp on the ground again. She was really an eyesore who he wanted to kill.Ruan Jiaojiao noticed the killing intent surging in the Demon Lord\u2019s eyes, and quickly hooked her hands over his neck to send a passionate kiss.Using her beauty as the trick, Ruan Jiaojiao asked questions to divert his attention.\u201cI don\u2019t know what plan your lord has now? You controlled God Luo Ya as a Fallen Demon by using a soul-defying technique, causing his Immortal body to die. The Immortal Emperor is very angry and is ready to attack the Demon Realm.\u201dHe snorted disdainfully.\u201cIf you want to deal with me, I will let him come back and forth\u2026\u201dRuan Jiaojiao was secretly startled, listening to the Demon Lord\u2019s clear words which were implicit and profound, as if not afraid of the war between the Immortals and the Demons.\u201cIf you say not to kill her, I will spare her life, but the death penalty is unavoidable, and the living sinner cannot escape.\u201dHe didn\u2019t intend to let Lan Xue off easily. Back then, how could he not hear the malice in this woman\u2019s words. To anger the Demon Lord, there was a reason needed. With a flick of his finger, an ice needle slammed into Lan Xue\u2019s waist.\u201cI want her to survive and die.\u201dAfter resolving Lan Xue, the Demon Lord then hugged Ruan Jiaojiao. The petite girl was held in his arms, and the black cloak surged in the wind like a goshawk <sup>1</sup> System: A bird. soaring.\u201cI helped you, it\u2019s time for you to pay back.\u201dHe kissed her lips and smiled wickedly, fascinated by Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s idiotic eyes. When she returned to her senses, she was already in the Demon Realm.She vaguely heard a hand bowing.\u201cSubordinate pays homage to the Queen of Demon Lord.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dSlow\u2026 Slow down\u2026What is that person talking about?When Ruan Jiaojiao was taken all the way into his room by the Demon Lord, she glanced around the room, she was even more shocked.Originally there was only an ice bed, but now the empty room was filled with a dazzling array of festive objects and furnishings, giving it a new look.Even the cold ice bed was replaced by the same bed she had in the Immortal Realm, covered with a bright red blanket and red bed curtains, showing a lively and cheerful atmosphere.\u201cI asked them to arrange this, do you like it?\u201d The Demon Lord was obviously in a good mood, pushed her down on the bed, and licked and kissed her delicate and long neck.Ruan Jiaojiao: \u201c\u2026\u201dShe would be a fool if she didn\u2019t understand his intention to play with her.But\u2026 but she is already married!!!She has become an immortal couple with God Qingshu, and now she is a Queen of the Demons? Wouldn\u2019t the male lead\u2019s green hat be properly added once more?Hey, it seemed good to think about it this way.Ruan Jiaojiao took advantage of his neck to support herself, her legs wrapped around his waist, her black hair was scattered on the red blanket like a waterfall, her eyes were silky and her breath was warm.\u201cMy lord, you\u2026Will you be gentle with me\u2026I\u2019m afraid of pain\u2026\u201dAs soon as she finished her sentence, he slicked his big palm, and the skirt on her body instantly fell to pieces.Alas\u2026 the demon is still violent tempered\u2026\u201cWell\u2026\u201dWhen his sturdy meat stick puffed into her flower hole, Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s eyes squinted from the momentary soreness. He couldn\u2019t wait to start his fierce thrusting, and the violent waist moved like a greedy beast.Ruan Jiaojiao, who had been suffering from a long drought, had a sudden drop of rain. Amidst the brutal and savage rain, she was quickly pushed to the peak of lust. She was so happy that she couldn\u2019t say a word, and could only make non recognisable sounds.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Too messy!Being overwhelmed by the red waves and eating meat after so long, Ruan Jiaojiao was really happy, not to mention that such an evil god like Demon Lord was really flattering when he was gentle, and she couldn\u2019t stand his sincerity.Ruan Jiaojiao entered the realm as per the custom, and now she wandered around in the Demon Realm in a black dress all day long, enjoying being respectfully called the Queen of Demon Lord everywhere.When Xiao Li brought Mo Ling to find her, she suddenly remembered, no wonder she always felt that she had forgotten something.She forgot that she still had a son.Mo Ling was a demon, and Xiao Li was a half-immortal and half-demon. The relationship between the Demons and Demons was not as incompatible as the one between Immortals and Demons, so the two people came in smoothly.\u201cMother! Hug!!!\u201dA group of demons were stunned to see a beautiful and insane little brat rushing into their Queen\u2019s arms.The blood of father and son is thicker than water, and the natural tacit understanding made Xiao Li and Mo Ling still get along well, but Xiao Li still thought about his mother. He had a lot of heavenly weapons sent by the Emperor of the Immortal Realm, and it didn\u2019t take much effort to find his mother.This situation was a bit tricky for Ruan Jiaojiao. Her child and her child\u2019s father had found her. She was now eating well in the Demon Realm because of the Demon Lord\u2019s face. If this annoys the Demon Lord, I am afraid that all three of them will be finished.Ruan Jiaojiao knew that someone was going to tell the Demon Lord, and it would be bad if they met.So she said nothing, took both Xiao Li and Mo Ling, smeared the soles of her feet, and the three of them fled all the way to the Immortal Realm to seek shelter.But back to the celestial world, the situation was still complicated.God Qingshu was the husband who held the marriage ceremony with her in an upright manner, so Mo Ling\u2019s identity was embarrassing again.Ruan Jiaojiao returned to her Xianju first, settled down Mo Ling, and was about to find God Qingshu for a showdown.Choosing the day was worse than implementing things in the day. This was the last step of her plan. After using the Supreme God Qingshu, she simply dumped him.As a result, Ruan Jiaojiao never expected that the Demon Lord would bring a large number of troops and horses directly to the Immortal Realm.The Demon Lord led thousands of men and horses to the city, and everyone in the celestial realm hurriedly prepared to fight.Ruan Jiaojiao was really caught off guard. She bit her lips, preparing to stop the Immortal and Demon battle, but was stopped by God Qingshu.\u201cDon\u2019t go!\u201dSince the two got married, Ruan Jiaojiao had been holding on to God Qingshu and had the upper hand, but at that moment, Qingshu seems to be the Immortal Realm\u2019s noble and determined posture.\u201cThe Demon Lord just wants me, I can resolve the current dispute after I go.\u201dRuan Jiaojiao explained, but Xiao Li suddenly jumped out and hugged her leg.\u201cMother! Don\u2019t leave Xiao Li!!!\u201dFacing the sudden emergence of her little raccoon, Ruan Jiaojiao was really blank on what to do, however it seemed that the situation was not chaotic enough, Xiao LI shouted again.\u201cFather! Tell my mother, tell her not to leave us!!!\u201dXiao Li\u2019s loud voice attracted almost everyone\u2019s attention, but the object of his shouting was not God Qingshu, but a white-clothed young man with a beautiful face, with three tails dangling behind him, he was clearly a fox demon, who only had a shallow cultivation base, which immediately attracted everyone\u2019s surprised and confused eyes.This is good, she was all exposed!Ruan Jiaojiao looked at God Qingshu. She wanted to save him some face, but now she could only hold Mo Ling\u2019s hand under the eyes of everyone, and approach God Qingshu.\u201cI am sorry.\u201dCompared with the noisy little raccoon, the two men \u2013 Qingshu God and Mo Ling looked very calm, so Ruan Jiaojiao touched the little raccoon\u2019s head, the little fox closed his eyes, and went to sleep.Ruan Jiaojiao picked up the little baby and stuffed him into Mo Ling\u2019s arms, and at the same time suddenly tiptoed to kiss Mo Ling\u2019s lips.Her moves immediately caused an uproar in the Immortal Realm and Demon Realm, the people in the Immortal Realm looked strangely at God Qingshu, while the people in the demon world looked at their Demon Lord.Ruan Jiaojiao entangled Mo Ling\u2019s lips and teeth without a care about anything else. In the mighty confrontation between the two armies of the Immortal and Demon Realms, the intimacy of the two with peerless beauty suddenly gave birth to the romantic beauty of love in the city.What others didn\u2019t know was that Ruan Jiaojiao was continuously pouring her body\u2019s spiritual power into Mo Ling.At the end of the kiss, Mo Ling\u2019s three wagging tails instantly spread out like a feather fan, turning into nine tails, and then disappeared without a trace.Mo Ling completely transformed into a human form, which was a manifestation of a rise in his cultivation base.\u201cOriginally, I wanted to continue my relationship with you, but it\u2019s a pity that good luck makes people. I owe too much. Your tens of thousands of years of practice was ruined because of me. This is the compensation I can give you now.\u201dRuan Jiaojiao smiled at Mo Ling, vaguely saying goodbye.Fortunately, not long after the two met, his feelings for her were not as deep as in the previous life, so the separation would not leave too many scars.But when she was about to leave, the two men simultaneously stretched out their hands and grabbed her.Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s wrists were held by Mo Ling and God Qingshu respectively, and with a firm attitude, they were determined not to let her move half a step.As the three entangled, the Demon Lord sneered.\u201cIs that enough acting? Ruan Jiaojiao, do you remember what you promised me back then?\u201dAt the same time the Demon Lord\u2019s words were uttered, Ruan Jiaojiao heard a voice in the sea of her consciousness, which was exactly what she had said sweetly to coax the Demon Lord.\u201cI am willing to do my best for my lord, and when I get my revenge, I am willing to pledge allegiance and serve you, be it a slave or a concubine, I will not have any complaints.\u2026Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s face was as calm as water, but in her heart she felt panicked and flustered.And the drama of three men fighting for one woman was staged. For the people in the Immortal Realm and the Demon Realm, they behaved as the melon-eating audience. It was obviously supposed to be an intense battle which would be full of sparks and flames, but the army\u2019s faces which were serious and tense were actually burning fiercely and were filled with gossip.In the Demon Lord\u2019s dark and cold eyes, Ruan Jiaojiao inexplicably felt weak in her legs, but because Qingshu and Mo Ling pulled her together, it seemed to give her support and courage.\u201cYou let me go first.\u201dShe frowned and struggled slightly, thus both God Qingshu and Mo Ling both let go of her.Upon seeing this, the Demon Lord said with a soft expression and said to her.\u201cCome here.\u201dRuan Jiaojiao bit her lip and looked at him, then shook her head gently.\u201cYou know what I am like. I did rather be a broken jade than an intact tile <sup>1</sup> System: To prefer death over surrendering to someone/something. . Don\u2019t you push me\u201dAs soon as she uttered her words, the Demon Lord\u2019s handsome face was covered in frost.\u201cYou are so good!\u201dHis phoenix\u2019s eyes narrowed slightly, and the dangerous and terrifying aura emanating made people who were a little closer to him could not help but shiver, as if they were frostbitten by the invisible cold air.The Empress on the side was really in a mess. At first, she thought that Demon Lord suddenly attacked the immortal Realm because of sinister ambitions, but now looking at this scene, it was clear that he was here to ask about her. Is this Demon Lord still true to Jiaojiao?On the other hand, Jiaojiao actually brought the reincarnation of the fox demon to the Immortal Realm. Depending on the situation, she recognized the father and son Xiao Li. Although emotionally understandable, what should they do about God Qingshu? Those two were husband and wife\u2026A chaos!

But I\u2019m already married to God Qingshu and have taken him as my husband, and I still have my own feelings, so it is absolutely impossible for me to give up. The husband and the abandoned son will go back to the Demon Realm with you!\u201dAfter that, she bit her lip again, and there was a touch of difficulty in the surging eyes, she raised her sight to the ghostly eyes of Qingshu, and said seriously.\u201cI\u2019m very satisfied to be able to marry you. Let\u2019s just wipe out our previous affairs.\u201dSaying this, she cast her tender eyes on the little raccoon who was deep in dreamland by her spell.\u201cI can only say that I have nothing to do with you. Xiao Li needs father\u2019s love to grow up. After all, blood between him and Mo Ling is thicker than water, so I\u2026\u201d\u201cI refuse!\u201dQing Shu, who had been silent all this time, suddenly interrupted her confession of true feelings.\u201cYou are my wife! This will not change no matter what!!\u201dUpon hearing this, Ruan Jiaojiao sighed softly, her eyes drooping helplessly, her pink face and soft cheeks slowly rolled down a crystal clear tear, which hung on the delicate and small chin, about to fall.The beauty is weeping, such a sight naturally arouses pity, even if a man\u2019s heart is as stiff as a stone, I am afraid that it will soften to be tender.For a moment, everyone seemed to empathise with her dilemma, and their hearts trembled unconsciously, leaving only a sigh.Who would have thought that the promised battle between immortals and demons would turn into a bloody meeting for the mediation of emotional disputes between men and women.As a result, the imminent battle never finished.It is said that when emotional entanglements between men and women are placed on mortals, it is naturally difficult to have the best of both worlds.For mortals, life is no more than a few dozen years with limited time and energy.But immortals are different. They have unlimited time and strength, as long as they are willing to give in to love, harmony can still be achieved.Ever since, under the negotiation and compromise between God Qingshu and Dongfang Shi, Ruan Jiaojiao blatantly lived a life of polyandry for the sake of peace between the immortal and demon realms.On the little raccoon\u2019s side, after Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s brainwashing, that a good man is full of ambitions, and couldn\u2019t be around his mother every day as it would result in becoming a baby who never grows up, thus she threw him to the South China Sea to pay respects to Guanyin as a disciple.And as Mo Ling was not used to living in the Immortal world, he returned to live in the demon world.In this way, the three men live in one corner of different realms, and can\u2019t meet each other, allowing them all to live in peace.Ruan Jiaojiao sometimes lived in the Immortal realm, sometimes in the Demon realm, and sometimes went to live in the Mortal world.The three husbands, of course, will also be jealous. After all, there are grievances and historical conflicts between the immortals and demons, so God Qingshu and Demon Lord Dongfang Shi occasionally clashed.But Ruan Jiaojiao simply left them behind. Later, they also vaguely gave birth to a subtle friendship based on sympathy.After all, they were asking for the current situation, otherwise, with Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s attitude, she would rather die than be restrained or choose Mo Ling.The immortals and demons couldn\u2019t help sighing. They didn\u2019t expect the peace of the six realms to come so hastily, but everyone hoped to live with no war casualties, and didn\u2019t want blood to flow into rivers and people to die.In this fantasy world, Ruan Jiaojiao did not stay that long.In fact, she had played enough for a long time and got bored, so she used the points earned from the task to exchange for a clone to replace her, then patted her butt, and left gracefully.\u2026Mo Ling\u2019s Side StoryHe is just an ordinary fox demon, but was born with a heart disease, always in dull pain. He felt as if something was missing in his heart, he felt incomplete.And he often had a dream, in which there was a young girl whose face couldn\u2019t be seen clearly, but Mo Ling intuitively believed that the girl was his lover in his previous life. The elders of the clan made a divination and verified his guess.The elders said that his predestined relationship was not yet complete, and asked him to wait patiently for her who is destined to be with him.Mo Ling did not expect that in addition to a beautiful wife, he had a lovely child from his previous life.\u201cHusband!\u201dMo Ling grew up and had never seen such a beautiful woman. The fox demon clan produced beauties, but this woman was like a fairy who descended from the sky. She descended from the sky and fell into his arms gracefully.She wrapped her arms around his neck and smiled at him, calling his husband in a familiar and affectionate tone.At that moment, the missing piece in his heart seemed to be complete. He knew that the person he was waiting for was her.Somehow, the scene in front of Mo Ling was as if the scene had reappeared from yesterday.On the battlefield of the immortals and demons, not only did he gain mana with her kiss, he also gained the memories of his previous life.He recalled his love at first sight for her, remembered the sword that pierced their chests, his heart and blood merged with hers. As long as he can be with her, he doesn\u2019t care about anything, he is willing.Tens of thousands of years filled with loneliness, how can I be able to live without her lingering and tender self, even if there is only a flick of sweetness.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Her body bore faint signs of pain and injury, as if she had been beaten, causing a throbbing pain throughout her internal organs.What left her speechless and choked with disbelief was that she was being ruthlessly penetrated by a man. With each ferocious thrust, he aggressively plunged into her delicate flower. The man maintained a calm and indifferent expression, dressed immaculately in a black shirt and black trousers. He only lowered his zipper to expose his weapon of violence, while his cold and eerie gaze hovered over her, as if it were a form of punishment.Even more depraved was the presence of three other well-groomed men in the room, aside from her and the man. They casually pushed cups around, seemingly oblivious to the explicit scene unfolding nearby, or rather, observing with cold indifference.\u201cSystem! Why are you giving me such a perverse scenario right from the start?!\u201dRuan Jiaojiao couldn\u2019t help but internally complain and mock.At that moment, the system\u2019s mischievous voice rang out.\u201cBut you like the \u2018n-p\u2019 genre, don\u2019t you? In the previous world, you even had multiple husbands. This time, I\u2019ve served you a full feast right off the bat\u2014four handsome guys, all with top-notch looks. They definitely match your aesthetic preferences. No need to be polite, indulge yourself to your heart\u2019s content. Don\u2019t thank me too much for my generosity. Hehehe\u2026\u201dRuan Jiaojiao wanted to flip the middle finger at this stupid system, but right now she was more concerned about understanding the situation.So she closed her eyes again, turned her head, and bit her lip, enduring the man\u2019s violation.Although the man was handsome, she had injuries all over her body. Being tossed around like this, it hurt\u2026 it hurt so much!After receiving the plot, Ruan Jiaojiao wanted to curse.Originally, she was a top-level assassin trained by an underground organisation. However, during a mission, due to incorrect information provided by the organisation, she ended up killing the wrong person, which offended a more mysterious and powerful organisation.The opposing force had influence over both the political and business worlds, having almost limitless power. The original organisation felt threatened and without hesitation, they pushed the original identity forward to take the blame.After being used and abandoned mercilessly by the trusted organisation, she was left with no parents or anyone to help her. Her fate naturally became tragic and desolate.Of course, the explicit scene before her eyes was another tasteless addition by the system.Originally, the original body was tortured to death in various cruel punishments, and in the end, her corpse was abandoned in the wilderness without anyone even there to collect it.Ruan Jiaojiao opened her eyes once again and calmly gazed at the man in front of her. Her voice was hoarse as she spoke.\u201cWhat if I told you that you\u2019ve retaliated against the wrong person? It\u2019s true that I killed your friend, but it was because the information I received at the time was incorrect.\u201dMu Yi\u2019s movement paused for a moment. No matter what they did to her before, she remained silent, making them think she was mute.Ruan Jiaojiao also sighed for the original owner. She had no idea she was betrayed by the organisation; she simply thought she was unlucky and caught by someone. The organisation brainwashed all assassins to never reveal any information once captured.Assassins were tools of the organisation, responsible only for completing missions. They were unaware of the causes and consequences, so even if the original self wanted to defend herself, she had no way to do so.Upon hearing these words, the other three individuals also paused and then approached, surrounding her from a higher position, scrutinising her.Seeing this, Mu Yi withdrew his member from her flower hole, leaving behind a mixture of bloodstained fluids that flowed onto the bed sheets, leaving muddy traces. It contrasted with her snow-white skin and bluish-purple bruises, giving off a sense of violent and torturous beauty.All four men present couldn\u2019t help but admit that this woman was beautiful. She possessed a beauty that fell between a woman\u2019s charm and a girl\u2019s innocence, both sexy and pure.Who could have imagined that the renowned top-level assassin in the underworld would be such a young woman, so delicate and beautiful?However, upon further thought, it was precisely because she had such deceptive outward appearance that she could excel in completing missions.Perhaps using her allure was also a method for her to approach her targets.Mu Yi inexplicably felt a bit displeased, thinking about this seductive and tempting figure being touched by other men. Perhaps it was due to his inherent nature of arrogance as a natural-born leader, he didn\u2019t like things he had touched being touched by others.And the gazes of the other three men fell on her, revealing a certain common signal among men. Based on a subtle feeling, Mu Yi pulled up the sheet to cover her n*ked body.Rong Yu, Ling Zhun, and Gu Sheng noticed his actions and furrowed their brows involuntarily.Among them, although Mu Yi appeared tough and ruthless, he was actually the softest and most easily deceived. After suffering a loss from a girl when he was young, he kept his distance from women.Of course, besides Mu Yi, the other three men also had no favourable impression of women. Due to their involvement in underground activities, they had to be cautious of potential infiltrators and spies, so they usually stayed away from women.In their circle, the women they encountered were either gold diggers or arrogant and spoiled rich girls, which didn\u2019t interest them.However, the woman in front of them was different.A ruthless female assassin who had taken countless lives, yet she possessed beauty that rivalled flowers and the moon. But she had provoked them.She shouldn\u2019t have killed the pawn they had invested a lot of effort in cultivating and disrupted their long-prepared plan.\u201cBut did you really kill him?\u201dRong Yu calmly spoke while reaching out his hand to hold her chin, forcing her to lift her neck, like a swan caught in a hunter\u2019s hand.Ruan Jiao Jiao stared back at him without flinching.\u201cI am just a worthless life. I had long prepared to die for the organisation. I\u2019m just unwilling to accept that my fate ended up being thrown away like garbage. My life is ridiculously pathetic.\u201dAs she spoke, a cold and indifferent expression crossed her face, appropriately accompanied by a look of resentment in her eyes.Even the most merciless killing tool is still human, with flesh and blood. To be loyal yet met with betrayal, it was only natural for her to feel unwilling.Rong Yu seemed to be interested.\u201cOriginally, it should be an eye for an eye, but I can spare your life. I can even help you fulfil your wish and make your life less laughable.\u201dHaving ruined one pawn, they could acquire another, although it would be more troublesome. But someone who needlessly disrupted their plans should pay a price.Even if this woman was pushed out as a scapegoat, they would seize the opportunity to strike at the organisation\u2019s stronghold afterward and let others know the consequences of crossing them.Please note: System kindly requests you to read all of her translations exclusively on Second Life Translations.

It seemed to overlap with the image of the girl who had caused him emotional trauma in his youth, making him want to indulge in tormenting and humiliating her, to see the expression of pain and humiliation on her face, and to derive a sense of satisfying revenge.Ruan Yu glanced at Mu Yi and spoke calmly.\u201cTo be a tool for release for a few of us.\u201dIf it were any other woman, being described so directly as a tool for release would surely feel humiliated and provoke intense anger. However, Ruan Jiaojiao had been trained as a weapon since childhood, and in any case, she was just a tool.She casually swept her gaze over the four people present, as if scrutinising objects, and uttered two words.\u201cDeal.\u201dIn truth, everyone understood that she had no choice. Her life was in their hands. But her attitude didn\u2019t give them a sense of dominance, which was quite intriguing.And before, whether she was beaten with sticks or raped by Mu Yi, she always had an indifferent look.Apart from the hint of resentment in her eyes when mentioning the betrayal by the organisation, she seemed like a person without emotions. Yes, she was originally a killing tool, a sharp blade that drew blood and silenced throats.Although she had given her consent, Ruan Yu did not let his guard down and did not unlock her handcuffs.\u201cMu Yi, you may continue,\u201d Ruan Yu stepped back and said to Mu Yi, his tone casual as if discussing about enjoying a meal.\u201cWait a moment. Since I am the tool for release for all four of you, I believe you wouldn\u2019t want to see me being worn out too soon, right?\u201d Ruan Jiaojiao immediately interrupted Ruan Yu\u2019s arrangement.**A few days later, Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s injuries had healed to some extent. During this period, she hadn\u2019t seen any of them.She was confined in a place resembling a secret stronghold, restricted to one room. The room was surrounded by surveillance cameras, guarded by personnel 24 hours a day, not even a fly could get in.To Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s surprise, she actually saw the female protagonist.The female protagonist was a young rookie policewoman, full of enthusiasm and determined to fight crime and eradicate evil forces.Her aspirations are related to her background. The female protagonist, Xia Xue, was originally born into a wealthy family and was the cherished princess under the care of her parents.However, her father was assassinated through a contract killing, disguised as an accident. Her mother suffered a great blow and her health deteriorated. A group of relatives bullied the mother and daughter, taking advantage of the situation to plunder their family wealth, turning the female protagonist into a destitute heiress.Therefore, Xia Xue harbours deep resentment towards evil. The plot revolves around her getting to know many male protagonists and, by seducing them, silently enlisting their help to fulfil her revenge plan.Speaking of which, Xia Xue infiltrated this organisation and shouldn\u2019t have acted rashly. However, once they learned about her existence, they couldn\u2019t help but deliberately get close to her. This is because the organisation she belonged to was the one hired to kill her father.By the way, this story has more than one male protagonist, as it is an explicit harem novel.The male protagonists have different styles, but they all stand out with exceptionally high attractiveness. Through various coincidences, they end up in bed with the female protagonist, and after enjoying the pleasure, they each transform into ravenous wolves. With limited resources but multiple suitors, they even engage in multi-partner battles.Hmm, regarding this extravagant feast of s*nsual pleasure, Ruan Jiaojiao admits that it does suit her taste.According to the original plot, Xia Xue has only had childhood contact with Mu Yi.Yes, it was the female protagonist, Xia Xue, who caused the emotional trauma in Mu Yi\u2019s heart. Afterward, the two engage in a melodramatic plot of tormenting each other to the point of love, filled with cliched scenes. Of course, the plot is primarily focused on explicit content.\u201cMiss, please have your meal.\u201dXia Xue entered with a lowered gaze, carrying a tray. She had taken on the role of a maid here, doing odd jobs.Ruan Jiaojiao looked at Xia Xue with interest. The female protagonist was naturally beautiful but deliberately kept a thick fringe and wore old-fashioned black-framed glasses. Through this disguise, she appeared plain and unremarkable.However, even so, Xia Xue could still be considered delicate and beautiful. If her disguise were removed, she would definitely be a stunning beauty.But in the plot, Xia Xue\u2019s background was not yet revealed when she encountered Mu Yi, but her true identity was exposed.Fortunately, it was only her childhood shadow that Mu Yi recognized, and her undercover identity in the police force remained intact. Later on, she went along with the flow and deepened her relationship with Mu Yi to gather intelligence from within the enemy camp.Just as they were discussing, someone happened to push open the door and saw the presence of a stranger, causing Mu Yi to furrow his brows and impatiently shoo her away.\u201cGet out!\u201dStartled like a frightened deer, Xia Xue lowered her head even further, left the things she was carrying, and quickly left with her neck tucked in.Ruan Jiaojiao watched eagerly as Xia Xue passed by Mu Yi.\u201cHuh? How did he not recognize her? Doesn\u2019t he recognize her even if she turns to ashes?!\u201dRuan Jiaojiao looked at the closed door in silence, leaving only her and Mu Yi in the room.Mu Yi noticed that this woman wasn\u2019t paying any attention to him at all, not even bothering to give him a glance. This suddenly made him feel frustrated and irritated.These past few days, he couldn\u2019t help but think of her from time to time, as if he had been possessed by an evil spirit.And as for what he was thinking about, it was, of course, savouring the sensation of her touch, the intoxicating feeling of her wet, tight little c*nt gripping his member, her cold and restrained expression when he ravished her. He wanted to see her lose control, to make her m*an and writhe beneath him. The thought made his blood boil, and he couldn\u2019t help but desire to come and ravish her fiercely again and again.Without saying a word, Mu Yi walked up to her, lifting her sideways and forcefully throwing her onto the bed. The mattress creaked as he pressed himself down on top of her.Ruan Jiaojiao had recovered from her injuries, so when he threw her like that, in a split second, she swiftly flipped over using her hands and stood on the other side of the bed, displaying her agility.She looked at him coldly and said, \u201cIf you want to sleep with me, you can just say it. There\u2019s no need to be so savage.\u201dMu Yi\u2019s eyes darkened like water, exuding an icy and dangerous aura as if he wanted to kill her as an enemy rather than have his way with her.\u201cCome here,\u201d he said in a deep voice, commanding her.Ruan Jiaojiao was displeased with his condescending attitude. Even though she was currently a prisoner, she was also a ruthless and cold-blooded killer. Therefore, she did not move.As the two of them confronted each other, someone else pushed open the door and walked in.Ruan Jiaojiao raised an eyebrow.Either they don\u2019t come, or they come in pairs?Is this going to be a threesome?Please note: System kindly requests you to read all of her translations exclusively on Second Life Translations.

Because according to Rong Yu\u2019s portrayal as a restrained character, even in the original storyline, his encounters with the female lead, Xia Xue, were few and far between, with only a few brief descriptions.To some extent, he treated the female lead more like a toy, teasing her like a cat playing with a little mouse. This man enjoyed the pleasure of strategizing and manipulating others\u2019 hearts, and had very little desire when it came to s*xual needs.Rong Yu pushed open the door and noticed the standoff between the two inside the room. His gaze fell upon Ruan Jiaojiao, his tone dripping with condescension.\u201cIs the self-awareness of being a tool for release still lacking? Do you need me to teach you?\u201dRuan Jiaojiao detected the mockery in his words and responded with a cold expression, but answered earnestly.\u201cVery well, he hurt me last time. This time, he wants to be rough from the start. Even if I\u2019m just a tool, I hope you both use me properly.\u201dUpon hearing her words, Rong Yu showed an expression of interest, while Mu Yi\u2019s emotions remained concealed, but his gaze grew darker and more profound.Rong Yu walked towards Ruan Jiaojiao.For a moment, the bed divided the room into two contrasting scenes: one side with Mu Yi, his face tense, and the other side with Rong Yu and Ruan Jiaojiao.\u201cCome here.\u201dRong Yu sat down at the edge of the bed, reaching out his hand towards Ruan Jiaojiao. Their gazes met, devoid of any romantic ambiguity, yet sparks seemed to flicker subtly, akin to a tug-of-war.Ruan Jiaojiao expressionlessly placed her hand in his palm. With a pull, she found herself sitting on Rong Yu\u2019s lap, her back leaning against his chest.This man\u2019s hands slithered like snakes into her loose white t-shirt. She wasn\u2019t wearing a bra, and Rong Yu\u2019s palms covered her perky br*asts, his thumbs and index fingers firmly pinching and kneading her ni*ples.Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s eyebrows slightly furrowed as her sensitive buds were toyed with by the man. She remained silent, but her body couldn\u2019t help but tremble faintly. Rong Yu pressed his face against her neck, his warm breath cascading over her neck\u2019s curve. Ruan Jiaojiao couldn\u2019t resist narrowing her eyes, and the stirring response caused a faint blush to bloom on her cheeks.Mu Yi stood like a statue, his icy gaze fixed directly on the intimate couple. His eyes were deep and inscrutable, revealing no emotional fluctuations.From his perspective, he could clearly see how Rong Yu manipulated her flesh, how his fingers moved beneath the fabric of the t-shirt, kneading and teasing her ni*ples like dough. Rong Yu\u2019s thin lips pressed lightly against her slender neck, lightly sucking.The scene was both er*tic and eerie.However, whether it was Rong Yu or Ruan Jiaojiao, their expressions remained cold and impassive, giving no hint of s*xual desire. Except for the slight blush on Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s cheeks and the slightly accelerated rhythm of her breath.The two of them tumbled onto the bed together, or more precisely, Rong Yu held her as they fell onto the bed. He began to unbuckle his belt. Despite the presence of three individuals in the room, it was unusually quiet, with only the sounds of their breathing and the crisp metallic clicking of the belt buckle.\u201cSince you\u2019re just a tool, there shouldn\u2019t be a need for much foreplay, right?\u201dAlthough Rong Yu\u2019s tone carried a hint of questioning, his actions were swift and decisive. He unhesitatingly spread her legs apart, and with a single finger, he hooked the edge of her panties and plunged it directly into her wet flower bud.Surprisingly, she was already wet. He hadn\u2019t expected her to be so sensitive, unlike her outwardly cold and composed demeanour.Upon noticing this, Rong Yu smiled faintly, while Ruan Jiaojiao did not show any signs of embarrassment or shame despite her body betraying her. Her expression remained calm and composed as usual.Rong Yu withdrew his finger. Initially, he had intended to use his fingers to further wet her, but since she was already wet, there was no need for him to waste any more time. He then pulled down his own underwear, exposing his m*nhood.When Rong Yu\u2019s thick and long member pressed against the entrance of her flower bud, Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s expression remained as cold as ice, as if she didn\u2019t care about him entering her body. Her posture neither welcomed nor rejected him.At this moment, Mu Yi, who was observing from the sidelines, furrowed his brows, his thin lips pressed tightly together.\u201cThis is our first time together. I will be gentle, and I hope the process is enjoyable,\u201d Rong Yu said calmly, as if the two of them were engaged in a business negotiation. He seemed to be delivering some kind of opening statement.Ruan Jiaojiao really wanted to roll her eyes. D*mn, does he know that trying to be cool and suave just invites thunder to strike?!She had encountered at least double-digit numbers of male leads and supporting male characters, not to mention the ruthless characters like Dong Fangshi she had recently experienced. In her eyes, someone like Rong Yu was simply not worth her attention.Seemingly aware of Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s indifference, Rong Yu, after pushing his member halfway in, stared intently at her face without blinking. Then, he placed his hands at the base of her thighs, spreading her legs to the widest angle. With a sudden dip of his waist, he thrust his entire massive meat stick into her tight passage.\u201cMake some noise,\u201d he commanded.In response to her silence, Rong Yu expressed his displeasure directly. Ruan Jiaojiao let out an unenthusiastic mo*n, going along with it half-heartedly.Yes, she was doing it on purpose. In reality, she really wanted to scream loudly, but she was feeling mischievous and deliberately wanted to provoke Rong Yu, not giving him face in front of his brother.At the same time, Ruan Jiaojiao clenched her small passage tightly around his member, the elastic meaty flesh instantly gripping it, causing Rong Yu\u2019s scalp to tingle. His fingers, gripping her thighs, tightened involuntarily. He fought hard to suppress the urge to release, catching his breath forcefully. The sudden gasp sounded particularly abrupt in the quiet room.Rong Yu was momentarily stunned, meeting Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s eyes that held a mocking smile. Her red lips curved slightly, seemingly mocking him.Rong Yu: \u201c\u2026\u201dHe underestimated his opponent.Rong Yu wasn\u2019t a chauvinist, so he didn\u2019t feel ashamed or angry about what happened earlier. On the contrary, he found it more intriguing.Their gazes met, flowing with a tacit understanding that only the two of them could comprehend. This feeling of being excluded intensified the stifling sensation in Mu Yi\u2019s heart, making him increasingly uncomfortable. However, he remained standing in place like a statue, unmoving. Only his eyes showed a slight ripple, revealing some emotions, but no one paid attention to him.Initially, Rong Yu just wanted to teach this cold and arrogant woman a lesson, but he almost made a fool of himself. So, he had to take it seriously. He wanted to fu*k her until she cried, to make her mo*n and gasp beneath him. The intense desire for conquest made Rong Yu deviate from his usual laziness and indifference. He lifted up her t-shirt, fully exposing her exquisite figure before his eyes.He revealed a purely appreciative gaze.\u201cYou have a great body,\u201d Rong Yu praised, a rare compliment from him. In fact, it wasn\u2019t to please her subjectively, but rather a genuine expression.As an assassin, Ruan Jiaojiao possessed a body devoid of any excess fat. Her waist was tight, and her lines were smooth and beautiful. She wasn\u2019t muscular, but rather like a small, agile wildcat living in the jungle. She possessed a petite physique while retaining the speed, power, and explosive strength necessary for survival in the wild.Especially her bre*sts, perfectly shaped like peaches, standing perky without spreading apart, they were soft to the touch yet had elasticity. Her curved b*ttocks were equally enticing.Rong Yu felt satisfied with the impulsive decision he made that day. It would be a pity to just kill her and dispose of her like that.He had long ceased to care about her killing that pawn. Punishing her, including the organisation behind her, was merely a way to deter others and establish his authority.Please note: System kindly requests you to read all of her translations exclusively on Second Life Translations.

She couldn\u2019t help but m*an in response.Hearing her soft voice, contrasting with her cold demeanour, it was like a drop of oil falling into a sizzling hot pan. Rong Yu moved his face to her collarbone, and with his strong and powerful waist, he increased the speed of his intense thrusts, a rhythm of nine shallow and one deep dips, suddenly filling the quiet room with the sound of flesh slapping against flesh. The woman\u2019s m*ans intertwined with the man\u2019s gasps, setting the scene on fire in an instant.Mu Yi clenched his fists, veins popping on his neck, but a tent formed in his pants. The er*tic scene before his eyes undoubtedly stimulated him greatly.He couldn\u2019t restrain himself any longer, his body moved, but at that moment, someone pushed open the door. The person hesitated for a moment upon witnessing the scene inside the room but immediately closed the door.\u201cAlready at it?\u201dLing Zhun unbuttoned his cuff and rolled up his shirt sleeves as he spoke, walking towards the edge of the bed. He had no hesitation in joining the fray.Ling Zhun\u2019s sudden appearance made Mu Yi retract his steps, suddenly realising that his emotions were off. He then turned and sat on the nearby sofa.The four men were as close as brothers, so Ling Zhun felt no awkwardness at all. He took off his pants and climbed onto the bed. Seeing him join, Rong Yu proactively changed his position, lifting Ruan Jiaojiao in his arms and settling her on his lap.Ling Zhun circled around behind Ruan Jiaojiao, sandwiching her between the two men.\u201cFaster, I want to f*ck her!\u201dLing Zhun caressed Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s smooth and s*xy back. This woman was truly enchanting, with an angelic face and a devilish figure. No wonder so many men had died in her hands. The thought of being able to play with such beauty made Ling Zhun\u2019s desire surge even more, his blood boiling.Rong Yu glanced at Ling Zhun indifferently, without saying anything. He directly withdrew his co*k from Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s pus*y, even though he hadn\u2019t ej*culated yet, his pe*is remained thick and hard.\u201cThanks, bro.\u201dLing Zhun curved his lips into a smile. This man\u2019s facial features were more beautiful than a woman\u2019s, so he deliberately cut his hair short to avoid a feminine aura. When he approached, Ruan Jiaojiao caught a whiff of a refreshing and cool fragrance, which smelled good to her. She proactively wrapped her arm around Ling Zhun\u2019s neck, embracing him.If there was one man among the four she most wanted to sleep with, it wasn\u2019t Mu Yi or Rong Yu, but rather Ling Zhun and Gu Sheng.Ling Zhun was straightforward, without any twists and turns. In the plot, he had a considerable amount of time having s*x with the female lead. He had abundant energy, understood what she desired, and didn\u2019t try to act cool or aloof. Moreover, he had a wide range of tricks.Due to Gu Sheng\u2019s medical profession, Ruan Jiaojiao had a keen interest in role-playing. Gu Sheng, who was familiar with human anatomy, could bring her to the brink of ecst*sy, experiencing continuous org*sms.As expected, Ling Zhun didn\u2019t disappoint Ruan Jiaojiao. He lifted her up, and with his scorching hot, long and thick d*ck, he plunged into her pu*sy with a wet sound, instantly reaching the deepest spot, stretching her pu*sy to the extreme and penetrating deeply, making her feel tingly, numb, and swollen. Then, his long fingers ventured into the place where their bodies met, searching for the sensitive bud hidden within her flower, kneading, squeezing, and pressing it. Leaning close to her ear, he chuckled softly.\u201cIs it here?\u201dRuan Jiaojiao was teased to the point where her whole body felt like it was on fire, and her blood was boiling hot. She let out a m*an, and Ling Zhun continued thrusting rapidly inside her while pinching her sensitive bud. Ruan Jiaojiao couldn\u2019t care about anything else anymore as her consciousness was overwhelmed by the torrential waves of passion, and she w*ntonly called out in pleasure.Ling Zhun, having watched numerous films, had a discerning eye like the other three men, they were like a flock of feathers, all extremely picky. Rarely encountering someone who ar*used his senses, and since Mu Yi and Rong Yu had already f*cked her, he felt a surge of competitiveness and wanted to show off his skills.This was his first taste of real combat, so he put all his lifelong learnings into action. He made Ruan Jiaojiao pant and m*an while continuously f*cking her, her flower c*nt becoming flooded with wetness, the sturdy bed shaking vigorously, emitting squeaky sounds.Rong Yu dangerously narrowed his eyes as he watched her revelling in a s*ductive posture under Ling Zhun. Her fervent response felt like a slap to his face. But at the same time, the desire between his legs throbbed painfully. If he could withstand it just a moment ago, now he couldn\u2019t help but want to penetrate her tight little pu*sy immediately. The aftertaste sometimes becomes even more irresistible than the actual sensation.When Ling Zhun penetrated her body, an indescribable pleasure engulfed him. He was incredibly thrilled, pulling out and thrusting in again, operating like a powerful pile driver at full throttle. Previously, he deliberately teased her sensitive areas, but later, he discarded everything and held her tightly, engaging in a rhythmic and intense piston motion. After hundreds of thrusts, Ling Zhun\u2019s throat let out a low growl, his body trembling, and a hot and viscous fluid shot out, directly hitting the depths of Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s ut*rus.He didn\u2019t pull out but continued holding onto Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s irresistible body. The lingering sensation persisted, but his flaccid m*mber was automatically pushed out by Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s pu*sy.\u201cMove aside.\u201dRong Yu\u2019s voice sounded above him. Ling Zhun had never felt his brother to be so annoying, but at this moment, he truly felt that the atmosphere was ruined. So he embraced Ruan Jiaojiao, momentarily unable to control his emotions, wanting to lower his head and ki*s her soft, red lips.Rong Yu\u2019s irritating voice sounded once again.\u201cYou were too focused on your own pleasure. Didn\u2019t you notice that she hasn\u2019t reached her cl*max yet? Don\u2019t neglect our tools.\u201dHuh?Ling Zhun\u2019s body suddenly stiffened as he looked at Ruan Jiaojiao and met her calm gaze. His self-indulgent tenderness vanished in an instant.Although unwilling in his heart, Ling Zhun still gave up his position in front, albeit reluctantly. His fiery chest remained pressed against Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s back, and his long arms possessively held her waist.Rong Yu couldn\u2019t be bothered to argue with him. He knew that Ling Zhun had just experienced immense pleasure. He had to admit that this woman had the power to captivate men, making her dangerous.But men are foolish creatures; the more dangerous the challenge, the more they want to engage in it.He gripped his own meat weapon and inserted it into her pus*y once again. Inside, it was liquidy and contained Ling Zhun\u2019s recent release. Due to his intrusion, a small amount of white fluid was squeezed out from the intimately joint part, and the slit between the tender pu*sy revealed the delicate pink flesh, creating an extremely l*wd scene.Rong Yu still kept her legs spread wide as he did in the previous position. Being able to manipulate this situation to his heart\u2019s content satisfied him. He lowered his head and looked at their tightly entwined g*nitals, suddenly feeling a peculiar sense of novelty, as if he had never been in such int*mate proximity with another person before.This made him unable to resist looking up at her reaction, only to find that this woman remained excessively calm, her expression indifferent.Rong Yu, who had always been composed, felt a spark of anger in his heart. He couldn\u2019t control his actions and thrust forcefully into her depths, earning a muffled gr*an from her and a gaze directed at him.He curled his lips, feeling somewhat triumphant. He didn\u2019t even realise the childishness of his behaviour. When he later became aware that he had intentionally sought her attention, Rong Yu couldn\u2019t help but cover his forehead, experiencing a loss of control over his emotions for the first time.Please note: System kindly requests you to read all of her translations exclusively on Second Life Translations.

They possessed extraordinary flexibility, effortlessly completing even the most challenging positions. Rong Yu and Ling Zhun felt even luckier to have found such a treasure, and fortunately, they didn\u2019t waste such a precious find by killing her outright.After the three of them were satisfied, Mu Yi had long disappeared without a trace, but nobody paid him any attention.Ruan Jiaojiao opened the door to the bathroom, intending to wash off the stickiness, only to find Mu Yi\u2019s clothes intact and soaking in the bathtub.Huh?Ruan Jiaojiao dipped her fingers into the bathtub and felt cold water?This man was taking a cold bath here. Was it for cooling down and releasing desire?Her astonished gaze met Mu Yi\u2019s pitch-black eyes, and then his long arm reached out, pulling her and causing both of them to fall into the bathtub. Water splashed everywhere, and she plunged into the icy water, but her back pressed against the warmth of the man\u2019s chest.He\u2019s still so hot even after soaking in cold water? It seems his temper is not ordinary.A faint smile curved Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s lips, which caught Mu Yi\u2019s attention. A sense of annoyance arose within him, and his big hand reached out towards her.She thought he was going to hit her, but she didn\u2019t expect him to hold her face and lean in, sealing her lips with his.Ruan Jiaojiao was somewhat surprised. Although she had been having s*x with three men, this was her first kiss.While Rong Yu and Ling Zhun had been enthusiastic in fu*king her, it was evident that they viewed her as nothing more than an interesting plaything. However, Mu Yi\u2019s reaction now seemed to indicate that he had developed feelings for her.He really is the most naive among the four men.Ruan Jiaojiao didn\u2019t refuse his kiss, but she didn\u2019t respond either. She let him invade her mouth with his tongue, playfully intertwining with hers, while she maintained her calm and indifferent demeanour.Noticing her indifference, Mu Yi increased the force, seemingly punishing her, and when he pulled away, he bit her soft lips.Ruan Jiaojiao didn\u2019t even furrow her brows. Compared to the various physical wounds this body had endured, this kind of pain was insignificant.He had pulled her into the bathtub for a kiss out of nowhere, but then opened the door with a cold face and left without a word, disregarding the water dripping down from his wet body. Mu Yi was truly unpredictable.However, Ruan Jiaojiao secretly rejoiced that Mu Yi didn\u2019t lose control of his animalistic instincts and forcefully take her in the bathroom.Before that, Rong Yu and Ling Zhun had done her countless times. Even though her body was resilient, she was afraid of her pus*y getting worn out.In the following ten days, Ruan Jiaojiao didn\u2019t see Mu Yi at all, but Ling Zhun came over every day, full of enthusiasm like a Teddy, tirelessly cultivating a silent understanding with her in bed.As for Rong Yu, he would come two or three times a week. This man showed little interest in physical desires. Instead, he preferred talking to her, chatting about various topics at his own will, regardless of whether she was listening or not, leaving Ruan Jiaojiao confused.But this time, her act of being aloof and cold was quite satisfying. Although she had become a captive, she wasn\u2019t inferior to anyone else. She even occasionally made some reasonable requests, all of which were fulfilled.This strange yet delicate balance was ultimately broken by the female protagonist.The female protagonist seemed determined to uncover Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s assassin organisation. Upon discovering this clue, she was unwilling to let it go and took the risk of secretly placing a listening device in her room.As a result, the female protagonist ended up digging her own grave, exposing the undercover police identity ahead of time.Without the previous entanglement and grievances between Mu Yi and her, he didn\u2019t even recognize her. Xia Xue was bound and brought in front of Ruan Jiaojiao.Rong Yu didn\u2019t seem very interested in this little mouse, but bringing her in front of Ruan Jiaojiao was to use her as an example, as her emotional reaction seemed to stir up his sadistic interests.\u201cHow do you think I should deal with this little policewoman? She actually installed a listening device in your room. Who knows how much of us f*cking she might have overheard?\u201dRong Yu sat on a chair, his arm around Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s slender waist, and he made her sit on his lap. With a smile playing on his lips, he whispered in her ear.Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s face showed no reaction, but she cursed in her heart.Is the female protagonist really that weak?If she doesn\u2019t help her, following the trend set by the male protagonists, she might end up dead in the wilderness. Shouldn\u2019t she suggest that they have their way with the female protagonist first? Maybe if they sleep with her, they might develop feelings and spare her life. Then the female protagonist would be safe.Fortunately, the female protagonist still had her halo. The alarm sounded, and a large number of police officers arrived.One of their hideouts was exposed. Although Rong Yu and the others were annoyed, they were prepared and swiftly evacuated.Ruan Jiaojiao wouldn\u2019t miss such a good opportunity and quickly escaped in the chaos.With her character, she would never be content with being a hostage. She was determined to seek revenge on her original organisation.However, Ruan Jiaojiao didn\u2019t expect Xia Xue to have targeted her. Xia Xue relentlessly pursued her, and combined with Rong Yu and the others blocking her, Ruan Jiaojiao found herself trapped, knowing that she was about to fall into someone\u2019s hands.At a critical moment, Ruan Jiaojiao chose to walk into a trap and threw herself into the arms of the police. She was handcuffed and put into a police car.The system was somewhat puzzled by her choice.\u201cHost, to be honest, Rong Yu and the other men aren\u2019t bad to you. They fulfil most of your requests. Why would you rather be in jail and eat prison food?\u201dUpon hearing this, Ruan Jiaojiao smiled but didn\u2019t say anything, her gaze toward Xia Xue, who was sitting in the car, held a deeper meaning.When they arrived at the police station, in the interrogation room, a man dressed in a sharp police uniform, with a cold and handsome demeanour, appeared, and the system suddenly realised.In the original plot, the female protagonist, Xia Xue, had secretly admired this male god since their time in the police academy.\u201cDo you really intend to sleep with this man?\u201dAlthough the system had witnessed its shameless and unscrupulous host, one being a soldier and the other a thief, their identities were in direct opposition, like water and fire.It seemed that this mission would be quite difficult, especially since the host had to become a captive.\u201cWho said that being caught by the police means I will definitely go to jail? They don\u2019t have any evidence of my involvement in any crimes,\u201d Ruan Jiaojiao said confidently, a smile on her face.The system was momentarily speechless.Indeed, as Ruan Jiaojiao thought, although she was taken to the police station, the authorities had no evidence to prove her participation in any crimes. Even when they raided that hideout, Rong Yu and the others had been cautious, and all the information had been thoroughly cleared. Even if they caught a few small fry, they couldn\u2019t extract any useful intelligence from them.Ruan Jiaojiao could openly leave the police station, but she voluntarily offered to assist the police in their investigation, on the condition that she be enrolled in the witness protection program.Furthermore, she specifically requested that Officer Shen Yan provide 24/7 personal protection for her safety.This request was clearly excessive, but from the perspective of the police, they were desperate to catch this lead, and they didn\u2019t want all their preparations to go to waste due to the female protagonist\u2019s recklessness.Xia Xue was the first to object. She had witnessed the woman\u2019s promiscuity and seductive skills firsthand. As Rong Yu had mentioned, she had even overheard Ruan Jiaojiao and Ling Zhun\u2019s intimate moments, which had made her blush and quickly turn off the listening device. How could she allow her beloved male god to be alone with such a shameless woman, let alone live together?However, Xia Xue was just a young policewoman, and considering the magnitude of her mistake this time, if it weren\u2019t for her blowing the cover, the police wouldn\u2019t have needed to use their forces and risk alarming the criminals.So, Ruan Jiaojiao got her wish and moved into Officer Shen\u2019s house, receiving personal protection.Please note: System kindly requests you to read all of her translations exclusively on Second Life Translations.

    "Chapter 97": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Being PAPA\u2019d Every Time I TransmigrateChapter 95 [5th World 6] Little Brother PolicemanPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTitle: Being PAPA\u2019d Every Time I TransmigrateTranslator: System YaoiKindly read this novel at https://secondlifetranslations.com/novel/being-papad-every-time-i-transmigrate/Chapter 6: Little Brother PolicemanAfter some interaction, Ruan Jiaojiao couldn\u2019t help but sigh.Officer Shen Yan, the male god whom the female protagonist Xia Xue had secretly admired for years, was indeed worthy of his reputation.This man exuded a strong masculine charm at all times, the allure of his uniform combined with his handsome facial features and cold temperament, making him a walking aphr*odisiac that stirred her sl*tty desires.Living under the same roof with him, Ruan Jiaojiao found it quite challenging to maintain her persona, and Shen Yan wasn\u2019t like the simplistic and avenging type of police officer that Xia Xue portrayed. His thoughts were more complex and profound, making it difficult for her to gauge him.As Ruan Jiaojiao observed Shen Yan, she also sensed a slight scrutiny from him towards her.She thought that he was somewhat curious about her.The system informed her that Xia Xue was afraid of him falling into her beauty trap. Although she didn\u2019t believe Shen Yan was that shallow, the female lead was still worried that he would succumb to her sed*ction. Additionally, it was an opportunity for her to get closer to him. So, she disclosed her background and organisation to Shen Yan, laying it all out in front of him.Not only did Xia Xue reveal her identity as an assassin, but not only did she expose the evil and dark power of her organisation, she even claimed how she had shamelessly sacrificed her allure and s*duced Rong Yu and the other men, mingling with them day and night.The system sarcastically remarked with an expectation of drama unfolding, \u201cWith the female protagonist adding fuel to the fire, it seems difficult for the host to win over this little brother policeman.\u201dHowever, Ruan Jiaojiao burst into laughter and cheerfully said, \u201cYou little fool! The female protagonist is actually helping me out.\u201dThe system wore a puzzled expression.Ruan Jiaojiao shook her head.The female protagonist didn\u2019t understand men well enough. Her setup actually piqued Shen Yan\u2019s curiosity. And how could a confident man like Shen Yan be afraid of her identity as an assassin?When a man becomes curious about a woman, isn\u2019t that the beginning of a romantic story?Moreover, Xia Xue intentionally portrayed her as someone who s*duced several men to save her life. The combination of her cold and hot demeanour and her sultry nature as a s*ductress, isn\u2019t it all the more enticing?Roses are beautiful because they have thorns. It\u2019s the challenging aspects that attract beings like men who proclaim themselves powerful.Although Ruan Jiaojiao and Shen Yan lived under the same roof, she showed no intention of initiating conversation or getting closer to him. On the contrary, she maintained her aloof attitude and avoided speaking whenever possible.Throughout the day, they had zero communication, except for meals at the same table.Shen Yan\u2019s gaze fell on her numerous times, but it was never too much or too little.In the evening, after taking a shower, Ruan Jiaojiao casually grabbed a towel to wrap herself in and calmly walked out of the bathroom.Shen Yan\u2019s gaze landed on her, and when their eyes unintentionally met, she didn\u2019t look away. Instead, they had a natural exchange of glances.Neither of them spoke. Ruan Jiaojiao raised an eyebrow at him.\u201cOfficer Shen, do you have any pyjamas I can borrow?\u201d\u201cJust wait a moment.\u201dShen Yan stood up from the sofa, his posture straight, and without diverting his gaze, he walked towards his bedroom. Ruan Jiaojiao admired his dignified and narrow-hipped figure, licking her lips. This man had a great physique and looked delicious.It didn\u2019t take long before he returned with a set of men\u2019s pyjamas: a deep blue, long-sleeved chequered shirt. Ruan Jiaojiao took it and compared it to her body. She wasn\u2019t short, but Shen Yan\u2019s shirt reached to the upper part of her thighs. She wore it as a dress, leaving the pants.She looked up at Shen Yan. He hadn\u2019t left; instead, he stood in place, barely half a metre away from her.\u201cOfficer Shen, don\u2019t you have any women\u2019s clothes here? Did your girlfriend or ex-girlfriend not leave anything for an overnight stay?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have a girlfriend, nor do I have an ex-girlfriend,\u201d Shen Yan calmly replied.Ruan Jiaojiao casually responded with an \u201cOh.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t expect a man like Officer Shen to be single. It\u2019s not because no women like you, but because your standards are too high.\u201dA faint surprise flashed in Shen Yan\u2019s deep, dark eyes. After all, living together, Ruan Jiaojiao had always been taciturn, and suddenly she showed interest in chatting with him, especially about personal life topics.Before he could respond, Ruan Jiaojiao abruptly spoke again.\u201cIt seems that the undercover police officer, the flower of the police department, Miss Xia has a special affection for Officer Shen,\u201d Ruan Jiaojiao said, abruptly throwing out this sentence. However, Shen Yan did not show any surprise or disturbance in his calm, dark eyes.He knew after all.Ruan Jiaojiao found it amusing in her heart, but her expression did not reveal anything, as if mentioning the thoughts of an infatuated young girl was just a casual remark.\u201cWhat about you?\u201d Shen Yan\u2019s tone was serious, as if engaging in a normal conversation.Huh?Caught off guard by Shen Yan\u2019s counter question, Ruan Jiaojiao calmly replied, \u201cI thought Miss Xia should have already reported to you, the police, about my situation prior to my arrest.\u201dPerhaps not expecting her to be so composed, Shen Yan finally showed a hint of uneasiness on his cool and composed face.Ruan Jiaojiao smiled slightly. She took a step forward, instantly closing the distance between them to within arm\u2019s reach. With a tiptoe, she could kiss his chin.But Shen Yan kept his back straight, and she saw his firm and cold jawline as she looked up.The male god that the female protagonist secretly admired really had no sense of charm surrounding him.Ruan Jiaojiao mischievously thought about reaching out to hook her hand on his shoulder, but he quickly grabbed her wrist with great reflexes.With a clean and swift apprehension, she believed that if she went any further, she might have been thrown with a shoulder throw.Shen Yan furrowed his eyebrows slightly, his thin lips pressed together. The distance between the two of them was too close. If this were in a different context, he would probably subdue her unruly hand and pin her down to the ground.With Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s current skills, she was not afraid of him, so she looked calmly at Shen Yan\u2019s hand holding her wrist.\u201cOfficer Shen, there\u2019s no need to be so nervous. I\u2019m not going to attack you. I just wanted to flirt with you. As a man and a woman living together, don\u2019t you have any thoughts about me?\u201d Her words were quite direct.Flirt?Shen Yan was momentarily stunned, and suddenly he remembered what Xia Xue had said to him. This woman had used her s*ductive charm to save her life, but he found it difficult to reconcile the image of her in front of him with the description he had heard.There was no doubt that she had an incredibly attractive appearance and possessed the ability to captivate men, leading them to their demise.Based on the information he had obtained, she was a dangerous woman.However, during their time together, he didn\u2019t feel that way. Instead, he was puzzled and curious. Why did she become an assassin? Was she forced into it, as she lacked the aura he had observed in other notorious criminals?\u201cWhy?\u201d Shen Yan asked straightforwardly.Ruan Jiaojiao blinked her eyes.\u201cI want to sleep with you. It\u2019s as simple as that, the pleasure between a man and a woman.\u201dPlease note: System kindly requests you to read all of her translations exclusively on Second Life Translations.

Among all the women he had encountered, she was the first one who openly and confidently expressed her desire without appearing vulgar or lowly.He wasn\u2019t just a typical straight man. He understood the almost ob*cene glances and s*xual invitations that women would give, but he had never felt that kind of desire.In the police academy, other male students would m*sturbate, watch adult films together, and enthusiastically discuss their experiences in bed. But he had no interest in any of that. He preferred studying cold case files and criminal psychology. This hobby allowed him to excel academically in school, and after joining the police force, he steadily climbed the ranks.But recently, he had been feeling bored. He couldn\u2019t find any interest in any case.And the female assassin who had volunteered for him to provide close protection was the only subject that sparked his research interest.Ruan Jiaojiao couldn\u2019t tell Shen Yan\u2019s emotions from his expression, but she believed that a beauty like her wouldn\u2019t be disliked or repulsed even if a man didn\u2019t agree.Moreover, this man had made it clear that he was interested in her. The only question was whether it could be transformed into s*xual desire.She suddenly curved her lips, giving a smile to Shen Yan.Shen Yan was stunned for a moment. It was the first time he had seen her smile. This woman had always been expressionless, which made him believe that this enchanting woman was indeed a cold-blooded killer.Now, she smiled at him, radiant like a blooming flower. Shen Yan felt a slight dizziness, eyes unfocused.But the next moment, this beautiful and enchanting woman suddenly attacked him. She swiftly swept her leg towards his lower body, demonstrating astonishing strength and speed. Shen Yan considered her one of the most formidable opponents he had encountered.Just as he was losing his balance and about to fall to the ground, Shen Yan quickly pushed his arm against the ground, stabilising himself. However, Ruan Jiaojiao launched another lightning-fast kick towards his face, catching him off guard. Fortunately, Shen Yan had maintained his physical training for a long time, allowing him to react swiftly. He agilely spun away, evading her attack.Shen Yan went on the offensive, grabbing her arm and exerting pressure with his knee, intending to bring her down to the ground as he had planned.What surprised Shen Yan was that despite her agility, she did nothing to evade his attack. Contrary to her previous aggression, she allowed him to bring her down to the ground.Shen Yan\u2019s heart skipped a beat. Acting faster than his thoughts, he released his grip on her, reaching out with one arm to support her waist, attempting to catch her.However, in the blink of an eye, Ruan Jiaojiao \u2018s smile deepened. In mid-air, she wrapped her arms around his neck. With a forceful pull, she brought him down while her lips pressed against his.The two of them fell to the ground, but due to Ruan Jiaojiao \u2018s swift action of embracing him and rolling along with the momentum, the impact was not severe.Shen Yan was somewhat stunned by the fact that their lips had touched. Meanwhile, Ruan Jiaojiao flipped over, pressing herself on top of him. The soft and warm petals of her lips repeatedly caressed his slightly cool ones, and her tongue tentatively tried to pry open his clenched teeth.However, Shen Yan kept his mouth shut. Ruan Jiaojiao pushed her hands against his solid chest, raising her upper body and gazing down at him with a cold and disdainful look.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Officer Shen? Don\u2019t know how to kiss?\u201dHer tone carried a hint of mockery, stirring up a wave of annoyance within Shen Yan.But she had hit the mark. Shen Yan had never had a girlfriend before, and with his agility, it was difficult for any woman to get close to him, let alone take advantage of him with a forced ki*s like she did.So, when Ruan Jiaojiao leaned in to ki*s his lips once again, not only did he open his mouth, but he forcefully invaded her mouth with his own tongue, engaging in an intimate dance. This affectionate interaction gave Shen Yan a physiological stimulation he had never experienced before. Their silky and playful tongues entangled, exchanging saliva as their bodies started to warm up, with a slight sheen of sweat forming on their skin.Shen Yan couldn\u2019t help but explore the delicate figure sprawled on top of him with his large hands. The skin beneath his palms was smooth and delicate, providing an exquisite sensation. He involuntarily delved deeper in his touch, intensifying their ki*s. He even thrust his tongue deep into her throat, greedily savouring the sweet nectar within her mouth.The two of them kissed passionately, gasping for breath. Ruan Jiaojiao wanted to stop, feeling choked as his tongue almost reached the back of her throat, tears welling up in her eyes. She couldn\u2019t help but struggle, but this man dominantly used his strong body to suppress her.She finally realised that Shen Yan, deep down, was actually a big tease. She thought she would have to put in some effort to s*duce him, but who knew the sparks would ignite so easily.She wondered if Xia Xue would be infuriated to the point of vomiting blood when she found out that her idol had turned out like this.Lost in her thoughts, Ruan Jiaojiao suddenly noticed her br*asts being fondled by the man\u2019s large hand. She lowered her head and realised that her bath towel had long since fallen apart. She was almost completely n*ked, lying on top of Shen Yan. His tanned palm completely covered her peach-like, snow-white flesh. The rosy nip*les were faintly visible between his fingers, creating a sed*ctive and picturesque view.Their gazes locked again, and the dense and heated atmosphere between them fermented.\u201cNever seen it before?\u201d Ruan Jiaojiao couldn\u2019t help but tease him.He earnestly answered.\u201cI have.\u201dRuan Jiaojiao was still pondering when he solemnly supplemented his response.\u201cAt the crime scene, in the morgue\u2026\u201d\u201cShut up!\u201dRuan Jiaojiao couldn\u2019t help but feel exasperated by his words. He was really good at killing the mood.Her outburst made Shen Yan\u2019s eyes darken, and an intimidating pressure emanated from him without any hint of anger.The atmosphere suddenly became tense, but Ruan Jiaojiao remained calm. She grabbed the bath towel and wrapped her s*xy body, which was only clad in under*wear.\u201cOfficer Shen, goodnight.\u201dShe patted her butt, ready to leave, but suddenly felt a chill as the towel that covered her body slipped off.When Ruan Jiaojiao looked down, she saw Shen Yan holding the towel in his hand. His expression was calm and composed, nothing like a l*scivious wolf who would strip a woman n*ked.\u201cWhat kind of pyjamas do you want?\u201d he asked her.\u201cYou\u2019re going to buy them for me?\u201d Ruan Jiaojiao crossed her arms, covering the spring scenery in front of her chest. However, due to her arms pressing against her chest, her ample bre*sts were squeezed out, enhancing the tempting allure of both resistance and invitation.Shen Yan made a sound of acknowledgment.However, Ruan Jiaojiao , who didn\u2019t know how to appreciate the gesture, refused.\u201cNo need to bother. Anyway, I plan to request a different police officer for personal protection.\u201dShen Yan frowned, but Ruan Jiaojiao casually extended her finger and lightly traced his high nose.\u201cFrom Officer Shen\u2019s ki*sing skills, it\u2019s evident that your technique is lacking.\u201dAfter teasing him, she didn\u2019t mind being completely n*ked. Calmly, she prepared to leave. Suddenly, her arm was grabbed, and then her wrist felt a chill.Ruan Jiaojiao was shocked.Shen Yan silently handcuffed her without saying a word.Please note: System kindly requests you to read all of her translations exclusively on Second Life Translations.

On the contrary, she felt a sense of excitement and anticipation, so she didn\u2019t struggle or resist. She allowed Shen Yan to hold her as he kicked open the bedroom door, placed her on the bed, and promptly shut the door. He unbuttoned his shirt while approaching her.With her attractive appearance and figure that exuded hormones, coupled with a hint of wildness and roughness, it was truly dangerously s*ductive.Ruan Jiaojiao wiggled her slu*y a*s on the bed, sat up, and stared at Shen Yan without blinking, unabashedly expressing her admiration and praise.\u201cOfficer Shen, you have a great physique.\u201dWhen Shen Yan truly approached the bed, she suddenly changed the tone of her voice and accused him.\u201cOfficer Shen, what do you want to do? This is breaking the law. Aren\u2019t you afraid I\u2019ll call the police?\u201dShen Yan\u2019s body stiffened, his actions momentarily paused. But the pause didn\u2019t last long. He sat on the bed, maintaining a dignified posture, and calmly met her gaze.He reached out his hand towards her, and Ruan Jiaojiao didn\u2019t dodge. However, he reached behind her and unlocked one of the handcuffs.Ruan Jiaojiao froze. Could it be that he was having second thoughts? Was he actually frightened by her earlier threat of calling the police?She was starting to regret having carried the act too far. However, Shen Yan took the unlocked handcuff and secured it to the bedpost.Ruan Jiaojiao: \u201c\u2026\u201dWhy did this scene feel somewhat familiar? It seemed that when she first arrived in this world, the situation was similar.\u201cYou said my technique was lacking,\u201d Shen Yan calmly repeated her earlier words.Ruan Jiaojiao remained silent.Shen Yan lowered his head, leaned down, and pressed his lips against hers. This time, he clearly ki*sed her with great care and attentiveness. He delicately explored her lips with his own, tenderly caressed her lips with his, and his tongue ventured into her mouth, entwining with hers. As he ki*sed her like this, her breathing became increasingly rapid, her chest rising and falling uncontrollably. Ruan Jiaojiao felt a rush of moist heat between her legs.In her mind, she couldn\u2019t help but praise, \u201cYou\u2019ve made great progress. The pupil has become the master!\u201d\u201cIf my technique is lacking, I can learn.\u201dShen Yan gently uttered these words, and his warm breath descended along the corner of her lips. One after another, he placed ki*ses on her neck, collarbone, and finally sealed his lips around her ni*ple, teasing it with delicate licks.Damn, he really knows how to tease!Ruan Jiaojiao couldn\u2019t help but raise her chest, offering it to his wet and hot mouth. Her free hand attempted to tangle in his hair, but his hair was too short to grab onto.Shen Yan had a clean and neat buzz cut, with slightly short and coarse hair. When he buried his head in her chest, his hair would prick against her tender skin. As his large palm caressed her other br*ast, she could feel the calluses and the warmth of his rough touch, especially on the pad of his thumb, which must have been hardened from holding a gun. Her thumb had a similar callus in the same position.His wheat-coloured palm, accustomed to holding a gun, now vigorously fondled and kneaded her snow-white delicate br*asts. His stern and imposing face during interrogations was now buried in her cl*avage, eagerly sucking and biting on her like a greedy and hungry infant.Ruan Jiaojiao felt a heat in her lower abdomen, and her cu*nt grew even itchier. A sense of emptiness became unbearable, and a large amount of fluid flowed out. M*ans escaped from her lips.Hearing her voice, Shen Yan lifted his head. His pitch-black eyes were dark and profound, his gaze firmly locked onto her.\u201cDo you still want to call the police?\u201d he asked softly.Ruan Jiaojiao: \u201c\u2026\u201dThis police officer\u2019s strategy against enemies is damn impressive!Having asked the question, Shen Yan didn\u2019t expect to receive an answer. He continued to lower his head, kneading and playing with her round jade-like br*asts, showing an insatiable affection as he occasionally planted ki*ses.However, an image suddenly flashed in Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s mind\u2014the female corpse Chen Fang he saw in the morgue. A shiver ran down her spine, and she quickly shook her head to dispel the image.Stay calm! He is a police officer, not a forensic examiner!Speaking of which, the profession of a forensic examiner has its own appeal. The original body\u2019s profession as a cold-blooded killer is also quite fascinating. Movies like \u201cThe Silence of the Lambs\u201d are enough to scare anyone.Damn, her thoughts are straying into strange territory.It\u2019s all because Shen Yan\u2019s gaze at her was too obsessed and passionate, completely different from his previous demeanour.Shen Yan\u2019s attention remained fixated on her silky chest, arousing Ruan Jiaojiao to the point of impatience. However, she was still waiting for the next step from him. Her ni*ples had become swollen and hardened like red cherries.Ruan Jiaojiao decided to counterattack. She wrapped her legs around Shen Yan\u2019s waist and squeezed tightly, pressing their bodies together seamlessly. Her lips sought out his sensitive spots, tracing along his jawline to his neck, lightly licking his earlobes, and exhaling a fragrant breath into his ear.With the moist and warm breath carrying a woman\u2019s fragrance tickling his ear, Shen Yan couldn\u2019t help but stiffen, experiencing a shiver. The wet and soft tongue caressing his earlobe plunged him into a state of enchantment, a temptation that stirred an overwhelming surge of impulses in his body, roaring like a flood, eager to express and release.This sensory experience was unfamiliar to Shen Yan, but he didn\u2019t resist it in the slightest. Instead, he was intoxicated by the novelty, losing track of where he was and wishing to drown in this tender realm. Even dying at this moment wouldn\u2019t be so bad.No wonder his former classmates used to say that dying under the peony flowers would still be romantic. It turned out that he wasn\u2019t disinterested in women; he just hadn\u2019t encountered a woman who could captivate his gaze and arouse his desires.In Shen Yan\u2019s intoxicated state, the woman beneath him suddenly flipped over and sat up, pressing him down.He was momentarily stunned, but then he saw the woman\u2019s red lips curve into a charming smile, exuding an irresistible allure.In the next instant, he felt a coolness around his wrist, leaving Shen Yan dumbfounded. Unbeknownst to him, she had somehow stolen the key to the handcuffs and now she was using it in retaliation, cuffing one of his hands to the bedpost.So, it was intentional deception earlier to distract him and steal the key from him. He fell easily into her trap, defenceless against her charm.At this moment, Shen Yan, who had never been at a disadvantage in front of criminals, couldn\u2019t help but wonder what he was feeling.Ruan Jiaojiao restrained Shen Yan and didn\u2019t rush into the main act. This Shen Yan seemed to fit her taste perfectly, and she was prepared to have a good time.In front of him, she opened the drawer of the bedside table, and as expected, his gun lay silently inside.Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s lips curled into a smile as she took out the black handgun.Straddling Shen Yan\u2019s waist, she was completely n*ked except for a small pair of under*wear, showcasing her s*ductive and enchanting figure in front of him. With one hand caressing the tent that had risen between his legs, and the other gripping the gun pointed at Shen Yan\u2019s face.\u201cBang!\u201dRuan Jiaojiao slightly parted her red lips, imitating the sound of a gun, trying to scare him and see if he would be frightened.Unexpectedly, the bulge she felt through his pants became even harder. Shen Yan remained calm, his deep black eyes fixed on her, unwavering and unperturbed. The hand that wasn\u2019t handcuffed didn\u2019t even flinch.\u201cOfficer Shen, aren\u2019t you afraid that I\u2019ll actually shoot?\u201d Ruan Jiaojiao playfully aimed the gun at his gr*yne.\u201cSince I chose to be a police officer, I\u2019m prepared to die at any moment,\u201d Shen Yan replied calmly.Ruan Jiaojiao admired this man even more.The female lead really has good taste. It would be a pity to leave this man for the naive and innocent female lead.She decided to make her move first.Ruan Jiaojiao casually threw the gun under the bed and leaned in, cupping Shen Yan\u2019s face, and pressing her warm and soft lips against his.This time, he instinctively opened his lips, engaging in a passionate ki*s with her.As she ki*sed him, she tore at his shirt, her movements somewhat rough. With a swift motion, the buttons of his shirt scattered and fell, revealing his well-defined muscles and v-line. Her lips followed suit, just as he had treated her, kissing his body along his collarbone, moving down.Please note: System kindly requests you to read all of her translations exclusively on Second Life Translations.

She raised her eyes and smiled at him.\u201cOfficer Shen, it\u2019s my turn!\u201dHer tone was somewhat playful, in contrast to her previous icy attitude. Shen Yan looked at her with a smiling face as she teasingly separated her fingers and aimed at his sh*ft, slowly sitting down.With the food so close to her mouth, Ruan Jiaojiao had long forgotten about maintaining appearances. She began to abandon herself to pleasure.Once she found the right position, she placed her hands on his abdominal muscles and, with determination, forcefully sat down, squeezing his entire p*nis hard into her sl*t hole.The narrow passage was instantly filled, and layers of l*wd flesh was stretched apart. Fortunately, the earlier foreplay had provided l*brication to her small hole; otherwise, given her unreserved posture, it would surely have been painful.\u201cAh\u2026 so swollen\u2026\u201dRuan Jiaojiao raised her face, unable to help but let out a sound that was half uncomfortable and half satisfied.Meanwhile, Shen Yan wasn\u2019t faring much better. His d*ick was squeezed into the tight and wet passage, instantly enveloped and tightly held by the enticing flesh from all directions. An indescribable sensory experience filled him, his body boiling with hot blood, and a warm haze of heat surrounding him, causing a thin layer of sweat to form on his forehead.Once Ruan Jiaojiao adjusted, she began to vigorously sway her waist. The previous foreplay had been delayed for too long, and she was burning with desire, eager to devour the deliciousness that was entering her wh*re of a mouth. Even if it meant devouring it eagerly and being somewhat impatient, she wanted to satisfy her desires first.So, she supported herself with her arms on Shen Yan\u2019s abdominal muscles, completely disregarding the man\u2019s emotions, tightly squeezing the sh*ft inserted into her hole, forcefully thrusting it deeper into her core.\u201cAh\u2026 hah\u2026\u201dAfter Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s s*ductive body writhed like a water snake, it suddenly tensed up like a drawn bow, and then with a whoosh, as desired, she shot her arrow and reached climax.She softly collapsed, her body temporarily devoid of strength, weakly pressing against Shen Yan\u2019s body.\u201cPhew\u2026\u201d After Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s satisfaction, she entered a floating state, body limp. Her hazy eyes seemed covered in a misty haze as she looked at Shen Yan.She hadn\u2019t even had a chance to see his expression when he grabbed the back of her head with one arm and wrapped his other arm around her waist, lifting her up. He ki*sed her lips passionately while his sh*ft, still inside her, forcefully thrust into her swollen flower.\u201cMmm\u2026\u201dRuan Jiaojiao\u2019s entire body jerked as her soft m*ans and whimpers were swallowed by Shen Yan\u2019s lips. He held her tightly in his embrace, their bodies intertwined,meat stick and meat hole tightly connected. With his vigorous movements, a large amount of fluid flowed out from their joining, leaving their legs sticky.Huh?Wait a minute\u2026Ruan Jiaojiao felt something cold and metallic pressing against her waist as he held her. She turned her head and realised that, even without the key, he had managed to unlock the handcuffs that were attached to the bedpost.Impressive!As their movements intensified, the still-unreleased handcuff unavoidably struck against her body.With his hands free, Shen Yan felt at ease. As his exploration delved deeper, his skills became more adept. He thrust into her wet and slippery flower cave, stirring up the scorching desire. Soon, Ruan Jiaojiao, who had just climaxed, was ignited with passion once again.Shen Yan pulled out his dripping d*ck, leaving behind a trail of glistening wetness. Then he flipped her over, spread one of her legs apart, and once again penetrated deeply into her most sensitive core.\u201cAh\u2026 ah\u2026\u201d Unable to resist the forceful thrusts, Ruan Jiaojiao, caught off guard, reached the pinnacle of desire.What kind of treasure is this god-like man?Ruan Jiaojiao was extremely impressed. Shen Yan was truly amazing. Despite his lack of experience, he had brought her, an experienced \u201cdriver,\u201d to the brink of ecstasy. In a short period of time, he had made her climax again.She lay weakly on the mattress. Even her previous threesome with Rong Yu and the others couldn\u2019t compare to this level of excitement. Was it really a difference in stamina?It wasn\u2019t that Rong Yu and the others had poor endurance, but Shen Yan, with his well-trained and exceptional skills, possessed an astonishing amount of energy.Ruan Jiaojiao felt like a fish being flipped over by Shen Yan. He propped himself up with his arms on either side of her head, his sharp gaze locked onto her like a poised male cheetah, ready to completely possess this enticing female that caught his eye.She couldn\u2019t help but feel weak in the legs.This walking aphr*disiac was no joke!Shen Yan\u2019s scrutinising gaze swept down her n*ked body, and Ruan Jiaojiao, lying horizontally, surprisingly felt a slight sense of shyness for the first time in her life. Of course, she didn\u2019t show it on her face, but her cheeks had a slight blush, like the blooming peaches on a branch, enchanting and beautiful.\u201cHow was my technique?\u201d Shen Yan asked.Ruan Jiaojiao hesitated for a moment and answered without thinking, \u201cNot bad.\u201dUpon hearing her response, Shen Yan\u2019s lips curved slightly, revealing a faint smile. The smile extended to his dark eyes, adding a touch of tenderness to his otherwise stern demeanour.\u201cDo you still want to change police officers?\u201d he asked again.Ruan Jiaojiao: \u201c??\u201dShe realised belatedly that this police officer still remembered her saying she wanted to request a change in place or Shen Yan.What a petty person!Ruan Jiaojiao was momentarily speechless. She wrapped her arms around him and bit the small bead on his chest, then extended her tongue to lick it delicately.Shen Yan\u2019s gaze darkened for a moment, and he lowered his head to ki*s her while capturing her mischievous little tongue with his own.The ki*s continued as their movements didn\u2019t stop. Effortlessly, Shen Yan\u2019s p*nis seemed to have developed a mind of its own, automatically finding its way to the sweet valley between her legs. Aligning with her delicate flower, he pressed forward, penetrating inside.As the thick and strong shaft entered her hidden depths, Shen Yan\u2019s waist and hips moved like an electric motor, pounding with a rapid and forceful rhythm. Sometimes shallow, sometimes deep, in this fiery piston-like motion, Ruan Jiaojiao felt a pleasure so intense that it was as if she were on the verge of death. Waves of continuous pleasure struck her, until she fell asleep, dreaming of her body being manipulated into various positions, with a sh*ft relentlessly thrusting inside her.In reality, the next day she would find out it wasn\u2019t a dream. Shen Yan had indeed spent the night f*cking her. When she woke up, the man still held her waist, and his meat stick was buried deep inside her.\u201cAwake?\u201dShen Yan\u2019s eyes were filled with contented delight as their gazes met. She was still drowsy, and he ki*sed her on the lips.Ruan Jiaojiao: \u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cGood to see you\u2019re awake. Let\u2019s do it a few more times. I have to go to work later.\u201d Shen Yan picked up his phone, checked the time, and then energetically lifted her up. With the change in position, his hard sh*ft instantly reached deep into her core. Without waiting for her response, he vigorously thrust inside her body. Ruan Jiaojiao\u2019s head spun, and she couldn\u2019t help but curse silently in her mind.What kind of monster was this man?His boundless energy, long-lasting stamina, and high level of s*xual impulse.Even if the fat meat was delicious, eating too much of it made her nauseous!Please note: System kindly requests you to read all of her translations exclusively on Second Life Translations.
