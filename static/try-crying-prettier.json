If this was real, he\u2019d never be alone with his sister Sienna.\u201cAkkard Valerian.\u201dSienna put down her teacup and called his name in a chilly, clipped voice. It didn\u2019t matter that they were siblings; there was no hint of fondness that could be found in her tone.Akkard answered with a grimace. No matter the place, dream or not, being alone with her was unwelcomed.Sienna, as usual, did not care about his mood. With her silver eyes wide open and flashing with contempt, she snorted. Looking down Akkard\u2019s arrogant face, she provoked him.\u201cYou think you\u2019re so brilliant, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cWhy are you trying to pick a fight suddenly?\u201dAkkard also refused to stand down. His manly features sharpened, and a shadow passed over his handsome face as if an enormous beast growled.\u201cDid you eat something wrong? Because you are spewing bullshit. Just shut your mouth and drink your tea. Don\u2019t irritate people with your useless words.\u201dRevealing his nasty temper, Akkard warned her and leaned slightly forward so that his tall stature would fill her vision. As the Commander of the Royal Knights, he had an overwhelming physique with a solid body that intimidated not only frail women but also aggressive men.Unfortunately, Sienna was immune to his feral force. Unlike her younger brother, she was thin, but she didn\u2019t lose to him in fierceness.She ignored Akkard\u2019s pretenses without raising a single eyebrow and warned him with a smile.\u201cI\u2019m saying this out of pity for your stupid ass, so listen carefully. If you don\u2019t clean up your trash life right now, you\u2019ll regret it forever.\u201d\u201c\u2026 What?\u201dIt was as if he was slapped across the face. Stunned, Akad missed the timing to retort back.Sienna had a bad temperament, but she had never been this overtly rude before.Rather, she was cautious with her words. Because what she said usually came true.Sienna Valerian. The greatest fortune-teller in the kingdom, the woman who sees the future with piercing silver eyes. She directed those same cold eyes at her only brother and said:\u201cOpen your clogged ears and listen carefully! Please crack open your rotten head and clean out all your thoughts. Otherwise, no matter how much you cry, beg, and pray\u2014it won\u2019t matter. It will be too late.\u201dAkkard, who was unilaterally verbally assaulted, was dumbfounded. No one dared to crush him in this way before.\u201cJust because you have a mouth, does it mean you can say whatever? Try talking again!!\u201dAkkard, who stood with a yell, slammed the table hard enough to break and exuded a terrifying aura that would have given an elder a heart attack.However, Sienna was demurely calm. She picked her teacup on the broken table and drank the contents. It was an attitude that could only be explained as a provocation.Seeing this, Arcade reached out, grabbed her cup, and threw it away.No, he tried to\u2026But that damn dream ended there. Suddenly, the ground stretched and grew long, and Sienna, sitting in her chair, moved away with a unique expression.His sister\u2019s eyes, looking at him from a distance, as if he were very pathetic. Akkard grew more irate.\u201cFuck off, Sienna!!\u201dIt was then. Suddenly, his feet plummeted, and the once distant abyss swallowed him. The feeling of being sucked down endlessly was like drowning.At this time, someone grabbed his shoulder as he struggled against the eerie fall.\u201c\u2026\u2026.!\u201dThe dreadfully surprised Akkard sprang up. He was so confused that he couldn\u2019t distinguish the boundary between dream and reality.The body\u2019s defense system reacted faster on behalf of the unconscious brain. He grabbed the hand that touched his shoulder and, without mercy, twisted it, and pinned it. Everything happened in less than a second.\u201c\u2026\u2026Ouch!!\u201dThe screams that touched my ears were delicate. Not only that, but also the body held in his firm grasp was frail and tender.Only then did the startled Akkard come to his senses.As he blinked a couple of times and shook his blurry vision, he could see red hair flowing like rose petals on the bed. It was a familiar color.\u201cSir Akkard\u2026\u201dA crying voice came out from beneath his body. As he lowered his head, he saw a woman crushed under his muscular forearm. She was looking up at Akkard with tearful eyes.\u201cGet your hands off me, please.\u201dShe was a breathtakingly beautiful woman. The skin was white as snow, striking red hair, a round forehead and delicate nose and lips with a kissable pout. Her visage resembled a fairy.In particular, the crying face was so striking that it took a moment for Akkard to realize that he had been hazily staring at her in a daze.He was half-awake, not quite sure if he was in a dream.Because of this, he almost heard the woman\u2019s desperate appeal amidst a soundless buzz.\u201cPlease, my hand\u2026 it hurts. Hey?\u201dA tear slid down her long eyelashes. A wet shine on her silky cheeks pressed into Akkard\u2019s forearm, which was squeezing her.Her touch burned like a hot candle. Startled, Akkard realized that this was real.He hurriedly removed his arms and examined the woman\u2019s slender body. Her weak limbs made him feel so stiff; his heart was pounding for no reason.\u201c\u2026 are you okay?\u2019Usually, women would sob and wail with pain and fear. But unlike her frail looks, she was tenacious. All she did was shut her eyes tightly and gasp in pain.Akkard touched her side of her pale face. He scanned her shoulder and collarbone, which turned red from when he crushed her.\u201cYou don\u2019t think your bones are broken, do you?\u201dAkkard frowned. He was foul-tempered, but he had never hit a woman. But here he was checking the bones of a young noble lady.If I\u2019m unlucky, I could be forced to marry this woman to take responsibility for hurting her.The ominous imagination sickened Akkard. I\u2019d rather beg for money then deal with emotional torment.\u201cLet\u2019s take a look.\u201dAkkard pulled down the sheet covering her body and exhaled. He was relieved when he meticulously checked her bones\u2019 condition by carefully pressing down on her neck, shoulders, and back.\u201cFortunately, there\u2019s no damage.\u201dHe had learned the sword, so he seemed to have used self-defense techniques unconsciously while sleeping. But in the midst of that, I remembered the young lady\u2019s grip. The body caught by him was so delicate that he realized that it would be a big deal if he did something wrong.In time, the pain seemed to have subsided a little. Her cheeks rapped with tears; she lifted her wet eyelashes carefully.A prettier woman when she cries. At the moment he saw her moist blue eyes, Akkard recalled her name.\u201cDamia.\u201dThe most extraordinary beauty of northern society and the daughter of Count Primula. And also a very sweet-skinned woman who warmed his bed last night.\u201cI\u2019m fine. I was just a little\u2026 \u2026surprised.\u201dDamia laughed, still rubbing her bright red shoulders. It was a calm face with no sign of resentment.Seeing this, Akkard felt even more like trash. Even though he was sleeping, he had hurt a woman who spent the night with him.This was all because of that awful dream in which the damned Sienna Valerian appeared. He was very proud, and he suddenly became displeased with his mistakes. With a hardened look, he blamed Damia in a blunt tone.\u201cSo why did you touch a sleeping warrior?\u201d.Anyone would be disappointed if a man who spent a hot night came out cold. But Dami was not agitated. She answered in a small voice when she dropped her eyelashes awkwardly.\u201cI thought you were having a nightmare. So I tried to wake you up\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s dangerous to touch a learned person\u2019s body. Next time, don\u2019t do that.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t know. I will keep it in mind in the future. \u201cNo matter how much he behaved like a bastard, Damia was not hurt or angry. Akkard was secretly quite impressed by this fact.His darkened purple eyes peeked slowly at Damia\u2019s half-exposed naked body. It was a rich and pretty body that you would want to engrave in your eyes, sensual but not vulgar as if it was a skill.\u201cNo matter how I look, she\u2019s not the type to play with fire. It\u2019s surprising.\u201dI didn\u2019t know what the hell caused her to throw herself to a man like me. But I thought it would be okay to sleep a few more times with such a woman.Oh, of course, until you get tired of it.Without noticing his selfish thoughts, Damia came down from the bed. Covering her body with a thin sheet, she searched the floor.The night is already over, so I think I will leave here quickly after finding my clothes.\u201cThere you are.\u201dDamia, who found her dress stuck in a corner, reached out her hand. But before she even touched her clothes, she felt the fever of a seductive man behind my back.\u201cWhere dare you try run away to, umm?\u201dA large hand that appeared from the air snatched her wrist.A face close to the nose, full of sexual purposes, laughed ferociously.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Run\u2026 ..away?\u201dDamia looked like a startled rabbit with big eyes, as she inquired. It was a one night stand. Akkard was famous for quickly breaking up women. Since it was her first time, perhaps he wasn\u2019t satisfied with her skills or mannerisms.\u2018You didn\u2019t even know I was inexperienced in the first place\u2026. \u2026.\u2019If he had known the truth, he would never have agreed to sleep with her. It\u2019s painful to touch a virgin.Damia tricked him into sleeping with her by acting like a woman skilled in the joys of the night. Therefore Akkard would definitely feel deceived. That\u2019s why Damia didn\u2019t get angry at his reaction earlier.She had used Akkard to forget her pain, and now that her business was done, she should leave.At least Damia had thought so. But Akkard\u2019s thoughts seemed different from hers.\u201cAren\u2019t you running away? Last night you cried your heart out, but my dick still wasn\u2019t satisfied.\u201dHe ignored the fact that her crying made him more excited. Then he pulled Damia\u2019s slender waist.The wind caused the sheets, which were barely on the bed to begin with, to fall. Akkard was about to kick the sheet to the corner. But his sharp eyes picked up the bloodstains on a corner of the sheet.After seeing this, Akkard frowned and his eyes narrowed menacingly.\u201cFuck.\u201dLast night flashed through Akkard\u2019s mind as he processed his shock. It never occurred to him that Damia Primula was a virgin. Just by the beauty of her face, he had assumed she had eaten a hundred men whole. He was stunned.Had Akkard known this, he would never have responded to her tempting invitation. Akkard stared at the bloodstains with a childish contempt.He hated virgins. Women usually attached too much meaning to their first relationship and tended to think granting their first night to a man was some great favor but to Akkard, it was a headache.Soon Damia Primula will be demanding and nagging him, too. When he thought so, Akkard was perturbed but quickly concluded it would be necessary to receive mental alimony in advance before being subjected to full-fledged suffering\u2014using her fantastic body, of course.\u201cSir Akkard\u201dAt this time, Damia, who was caught by him, hesitated to open her mouth.\u201cI\u2019m so sorry\u2026\u2026I have to go now.\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s the way it is, of course, I\u2019ll let you go.\u201dAn unexpected answer came from Akkard\u2019s mouth. His thick low voice was so soft it sent tantalizing chills down her spine and her back went stiff.Damia pushed him to let her go, but he didn\u2019t budge.Unaccustomed to men, she couldn\u2019t understand why he was doing this. As she looked up with trembling eyes, his sensuous lips whispered with a cool smile.\u201cPlease go if you\u2019re confident you can run away after I give you my hard cock and one hell of a fuck.\u201dHis vulgar words froze Dami and made her question her hearing. Unlike Akkard, who often played and socialized in the circles of debauchery, she came from conservative Northern stock and was physically naive. Therefore, she never heard the word \u201ccock\u201d come out of someone\u2019s mouth before.Akkard did not miss the moment. His hunting spirit hardened and grew sharp. As she tried to push him away, he drew her closer; her ample breasts clung firmly to his solid muscles.\u201cAh. Lord Akkard\u2026\u201dDamia twisted her body in embarrassment because she was at a loss of what to do. Her attempt to escape was respectable, but she had only ended up rubbing her nipples on his solid abs and chest. Feeling her initially soft nipples gradually straightening up, Akkard licked his lips and laughed.\u201cYou\u2019re going to go outside with your chest up like this? To whom | To have a pretty nipple sucked?\u201dAkkard pinched her nipples slowly, grasping her soft white breasts in his well-built tanned hands. His titillating touch stroked a burning flame hidden deep inside her body.\u201cAh!\u201dDamia twisted her body to avoid it, but could not move away from his thick body. Holding her waist with both hands, he threw her onto the bed at once. And in an instant, he climbed on top of her.\u201c\u2026..!!\u201dDamia, startled, opened her eyes wide and looked up at him. For a moment, she thought a huge lion had winded her. With that big muscular body, it was amazing that he could move so quickly.He laughed, twisting the corners of his mouth, watching Damia\u2019s trembling eyes. With a predatory smile, he whispered shamelessly to her.\u201cDon\u2019t worry dear, if you wish, I can fuck you until you are happily sore and can\u2019t endure it anymore.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

An intense heated flush traveled from her face to her exposed breasts. She started to breathe hard and her mouth went dry at the fierce sexual tension. The sense of being hunted secretly thrilled her.Damia shrugged and tried to cover herself but her timid attempts were soon curbed. He snorted low, amused at her cute actions. Then he held Damia\u2019s arms up and slowly down on the bed.Damia\u2019s delicate naked body was revealed. The scene underneath him confirmed that Akkard was a hot-blooded virile male.Akkard looked down at her bulging and jiggling breasts, his violet eyes darkened. He bit and chewed her up so many times last night that her swollen cherry-like nipples were incredibly sexy. Akkard\u2019s eyes deepened when he glanced at the intensely ripe reddish color on her flesh.\u201cI\u2019m a lucky bastard.\u201dWith his head down, he gently held the nipple in his mouth. When his hot, moist tongue sucked the sensitive tip, Damia inhaled.His tongue was overwhelming and didn\u2019t spare her. He licked up the saliva, then rolled her tip with his tongue again, soothingly. He soon washed up to the dark-colored nipple and pressed it with his lips and tongue. A spontaneous sound of pleasure came out of Damia due to Akkard skilled and lewd caresses, making her flutter.\u201cUh-ooon\u2026\u201d\u201cFeeling good? I haven\u2019t even touched this side yet; it\u2019s excited and standing stiff.\u201dLooking at her other breast, Akkard chuckled. The hot breath tickled in contact with the bare chest and neck.Damia covered her breasts with her arms, red-faced. Still, her innocent body was helplessly swayed by his skillful caress. He was a man of his word, so she would feel good enough to die.\u201cJust like last night.\u201dThere was a reason why she chose Akkard as her first experience.Akkad Valerian, a man from the capital. A great talent who is a direct subordinate of the Crown Prince, young and yet still heads the Royal Knights, and\u2026 \u2026a very bad man who shares a bed but never shares his heart.\u201cThat\u2019s why there are so many women in the capital community who cried.\u201dThis caused a stir in northern society when Akkard was ordered to go to the northern city of Rome. There was a state of emergency called the \u2018Akkard Warning\u2019.The north was quite a conservative atmosphere compared to the capital. The ladies were busy tending to their own unmarried daughters and nieces early on.All the men in Rome had sour faces, having fits, and giving trite moral lectures. Drums resounded down streets; bards sang songs, poets waxed lines and clich\u00e9 flyers warned against the infamous casanova.So Damia decided to choose him.Akkad Valerian | Because he\u2019s a bad boy that won\u2019t ask for her heart and he\u2019s going back to the capital someday.There was nothing like a night with Akkard to water down the confidence of the men who dared to try and control Damia. Of course, Akkard wouldn\u2019t be too thrilled; he would gain another tale to his notorious reputation.\u201c\u2026\u2026what are you thinking?The sudden spread of Akkard\u2019s hand held Damia\u2019s face. The man with tanned skin, silver hair, and dark purple eyes were breathtakingly sexy. Damia unintentionally gulped when his big shoulder and thick chest muscles twitching came into her field of vision.\u201cI\u2019m in front of you, and you dare to think of something else?\u201dWith Damia\u2019s eyes now full of Akkard, he smiled triumphantly, the corners of his mouth twisting into a grin. He relished the power his well-trained body had over women.\u201cWe still have plenty of time. But look how eager and hard your nipples are.\u201d\u201cAhhhh!\u201dHis fingers approached Damia\u2019s other breast, and she whimpered. He could feel the spectacle of the scarlet cherry nipples standing upright on her ample breasts.Surprised by this, Damia hurriedly wrapped her arms around her chest. As he said, he didn\u2019t even caress her yet, but here she was already reacting \u2014embarrassingly her desires were on full display.As if she was eagerly anticipating what would come next.\u201cWhy hide it? It\u2019d be unfair if only one side got attention. Now, let\u2019s visit this one, too.\u201dThe wickedly smiling Akkard pressed her arm down onto the bed. His hot, forbidden hand held her large breast to the filled his considerable hands and pinched the nipple that stood on it.\u201cIt seems only when you cum, you\u2019ll come to your senses.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Ahh.. hurts!\u201dDamia\u2019s had tears in her blue eyes. She felt an indescribable sense from the pinched nipples. The pain, which was sharp at first, embarrassingly tasted of sweet pleasure at the end.\u201cDoes it really hurt? Your voice is too sweet for that.\u201dAkkard\u2019s deep voice vibrated with a smile in it. He twisted her nipple lightly. Damia was panting at the sensation somewhere between pain and pleasure. When she was fed up and tried to take his hand off, Akkard gently touched her lips as if he were apologetic.A hot, moist tongue soothed and licked over the nipple, which had been pinched and became very sensitive. The tip of the tongue licked and rolled the nipple gently, and Damia\u2019s mouth opened and cooed with sounds of melting pleasure as she wriggled and sobbed unconsciously.Akkard looked down at Damia with a look of joy. Her previously haughty, dignified face was now melted away with the crying and moaning of a strange pleasure. It was stunning.\u201cWhat pretty breasts. They are big, feel good; they even have a beautiful color.\u201dHe grabbed both breasts, his hands full, and overflowing; he pushed them together and he greedily sucked on both nipples.\u201cAh, d\u2026 don\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t speak while biting them.\u201dWhen he spoke with the nipples in his mouth, the stimulus was too strong. Damia cried and pushed Akkard\u2019s shoulder. But instead of pushing him off, she got even more excited.It was thrilling whenever the nipple was slightly rolled between the white and even teeth. When he rolled up the nipple with his tongue and sucked it hard, the tip which withstood his bite yesterday, was slightly sore. But the pleasure that followed the pain was ten times more exhilarating.He slowly crushed the nipples with the roof of his mouth and tip of his tongue, sucking her breast a little deeper and fitting more of it in his mouth. Every time he did that, she felt like her sight was going white.Damia was completely lewd and disheveled under his lips. She didn\u2019t even know what kind of decency she was showing in front of his eyes. In fact, it was not until his big hands grasped her waist that Damia realized that her abdomen was shaking and twitching, her back in an arch of desire.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with your hips when I\u2019m sucking your tits? So obscene.\u201dAkkard was smiling, but the eyes were burning frighteningly hot. His calloused hands that practiced with swords were now slowly trailing down her narrow waist to her thighs. He grabbed her thighs tightly and savored it\u2019s silk-like texture and spread her legs.\u201cAh, no\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s soaking wet.\u201dAkkard\u2018s adams apple slowly moved with a low laugh; he was staring between Damia\u2019s legs. He slowly licked his lips and held his breath as if he had seen something very appetizing and was ready to pounce.Her red-colored vagina itself was like a flower in full bloom. The transparent, sticky honey flowing from it seemed to paralyze reason with a humid, lewd, sweet smell. Akkard\u2019s face seemed cold and expressionless, but his purple eyes shone brightly with his terrible desire.Damia\u2019s heart began to pound in alarm when she saw his deep regard that was fixed at her core; she could even feel it\u2019s beat in her red face.She felt like she would be eaten by him urgently, so her thighs tightened, trying to close her legs. But his strong hands that held onto her limbs didn\u2019t move.\u201cIt\u2019s dripping very slowly, but if you don\u2019t want to flood the sheets, I\u2019d better clean it.\u201dHis tone was dark, drenched with desire. Damia, stunned, shook her head, ears turning red in astonishment and embarrassment at his remark.Damia looked up at him with pleading eyes. The moment he encountered her tearful eyes, the Akkard clicked his tongue. Then he reprimanded Damia with a look full of grievances.\u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that. \u2018Cause then I\u2019ll want to squeeze it in right now.\u201d\u201cWhat look\u2014ahh!\u201dJust as Damia was about to ask back, Akkard\u2019s head dug between her legs. Damia opened her eyes wide at the incredible sight. The head he held up high with arrogance\u2014 his handsome face\u2014 was now licking between her legs, his eyes closed, his face focused, like a devotee in prayer.\u201cDon\u2019t clean, no. I\u2019m embarrassed\u2026!\u201d\u2018I can\u2019t believe he is \u2018washing\u2019 a precious place that I\u2019ve never seen before! It\u2019s even morning now.\u2019Now under the sun, which was clearly bright, Damia could see every single silver hair of Akkard, buried between her legs; she couldn\u2019t even imagine the detail he saw being so up close.\u201cPlease don\u2019t clean it.\u201dAn indescribable sense of shame and mixed with pleasure poured into her lower belly like a heated tide. A flushed Damia weakly tried to push his head away. Akkard menacingly retaliated by spreading Damia\u2019s legs wider.\u201cIf you don\u2019t stay still, you\u2019ll be lying on your stomach like a dog, and I\u2019ll eat you out. You\u2019d hate that even more.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The body in front of his was still naive but seemed to be overly ripe and delicious. It was apparent that if he let go of his reason a little, he would messily violate Damia.Akkard goods were large enough to be too much for even skillful women to take. So first, he had to lick this coy entrance and make it loose. So that he could be greedy to the ends of his roots.Akkard buried his lips between her held up legs, and sucked up Damia\u2019s swollen clitoris.\u201cAhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\u201dInstantaneously, a fever of white oil erupted. Damia\u2019s head was tilted back, shaking her legs unconsciously. The body, heightened with his nipple sucking, reached its peak as if it had waited for the slightest provocation.\u201cNot yet.\u201dAkad pressed down on her shivering vulnerable thigh. Then he broke open her small, shaking vagina with his tongue and licked it more persistently. He rolled the clitoris, which rose hard, jittery with joy, and rubbed the with his tongue. Gasping sounds came from Damia\u2019s red lips.\u201cWait a minute, aah! No, no, no, no, no!\u201dThe sheer pleasure was rising to the tip of her chin was similar to drowning. His tongue, soaked with saliva and her juices, squeezed in and out of her narrow slit. Then he began sucking at her nerve-wracking sensitive entrance.His elastic large, long tongue was hot, too, and exhausting her. While it poked and curled at her entrance tantalizingly, the saliva-soaked lips rubbed smoothly over the clitoris. Damia\u2019s toes tightened, and her hips flung up in the joy of being out of her mind.\u201cStop, please\u2026 \u2026whoa!\u201d\u201cDo you really want me to stop?\u201d\u201cYes, stop\u2026 \u201cDamia begged him, clinging onto him. She was afraid of the irresistible pleasure that made her lose all her inhibitions. Her saliva trickled out of her open mouth, her legs trembled with no strength, and her vagina was quivering with a hot throb. Damia was frightened out of her mind because she felt like something had gone wrong.Akkard looked at her delicate pale hand, clinging to his muscled shoulder. \u2018I thought I\u2019d chew this woman in front of me violently, but on the other hand, I want to melt her with my tongue and slowly eat her\u2014torturing her with pleasure.\u2019The treacherous feeling of curiosity thrilled him witenjoymentpleasure. So he decided to borrow both methods properly.\u201cLies.\u201dAkkard whispered intensely and unhurriedly between her legs. His wet lips, drenched in her juices, drew out a shiny line of sap that connected to her entrance.\u201cYou love it so much that it\u2019s flaring and contracting.\u201d\u201cOoooh-Uh\u2026.\u201dA teardrop rolled down from Damia\u2019s eyes at Akkard\u2019s vulgar remark. Akkard grinned with satisfaction.He usually hated a crying woman, but she had a poisonous taste laced with repressed needs. Perhaps that\u2019s why Akkard had such a sadistic urge to make her cry and reach new heights of passion even more.\u201cLet\u2019s check and see how loose it is\u2026\u201dHis two fingers tipped the wet petals, revealing her secret hole. As soon as Damia was about to regain some of her facilities, his thick fingers penetrated inside her. Dami shook her head when his fingers came in as if they were searching through the tight squeeze.\u201cAh\u2026 It hurts\u2026\u201d\u201cIt hurts? Even my wrists are all wet.\u201dAkkard, who had already stopped using honorifics, smirked and snickered. He began to stir and rub his fingers in her heated insides. As soon as the fingertips reached her weak spot, he could feel hot liquid pouring out.\u201cDo you like this place? Oh, look, it\u2019s dripping.\u201dAkkard sweetly whispered and bit her earlobe. At the same time, one more finger stretched through the inside. His fingers poked up the vagina, giving her a smaller preview of what was to come. Damia\u2019s body bounced up with longing, especially when he rubbed the part she was sensitive.\u201cHa-aaaah, Oh! There, there\u2026 No\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhy no, umm?\u201dAsked Akkard, who was caressing her ears with his lips, pushing his tongue inward. The clattering sound of wetness resounded through her eardrums. Damia couldn\u2019t tell whether the sound was coming from her ears or her bottom.\u201cAmazing. You\u2019re chewing my fingers like you\u2019re swallowing them.\u201dAkkard whispered in an unkind whisper. Only then did Damia realize that she was spreading her legs wider and shaking her back with the movement of his fingers. She was absent of her sense of dignity,\u00a0 the moment when his hand went in and out more violently, driving her to the climax.\u201cOooooooh, ah, ahhh\u2026!\u201dAkkard poked her convulsing insides with his thick hands. Whenever that happened, sticky honey flowed from the inside with a sloppy sound.\u201cWhat a great bargain. It\u2019s pretty, too.\u201dHe spread his soaked fingers revealing the sticky glittering threads of her lewd release, and licked it up with a smile.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Blood red it shyly poke out from it\u2019s hiding place between soaked petals as if only it had come out and waited for his touch.As soon as his hand touched it, Damia\u2019s slender curved lower abdomen contracted freely, shaking her body. His thick, deft fingers had made her culminate.\u201cI just touched it, did you let go? Oh, my God, you\u2019re so indecent.\u201dDamier could not retort to his teasing. With her head tilted, she trembled with the afterglow of the climax.Her curly red hair shook like waves, and in between, her fairy-like side face flushed red and shed tears. When Akkard saw this, he suddenly caught Damia\u2019s eyes.\u2018Truthfully, she has one of the prettiest faces I\u2019ve seen, she must make men go nuts.\u2019That\u2019s why he fell for her clumsy temptation last night. Knowing that it was not even funny, he said it was a cliche he had already experienced a hundred times, but he held on to her white fingertips.The face that made him throw his caution away into the wind looked up at him with anxiety, was so pretty.A superb fragrance was emitted from her slender neck. Akkard, unwittingly rubbed the tip of his nose and breathed in heavily. And like a lion marking its prey, he put his teeth on the edge of her neck.\u201cAh\u2026!\u201dAll the pain made her shiver with pleasure. The nape of her neck was defiled from the side.Hot lips sucked, kissed and bit from neck to shoulder to collarbone. Finally, after a kiss on her soft breast he raised his head to Damia\u2019s eyes. He laughed at Damia\u2019s disheveled appearance under him.\u201cFlowers are all over your body.\u201dDamia looked down at her body. His kiss marks on her pale skin looked unusually red. There were so many marks between the collarbone and the chest that it, indeed, looked like red petals had been scattered on top of her.What if it doesn\u2019t come off?Damia, who had never had a hickey before, was puzzled. Her fingertips curiously brushed over the kiss marks left on her chest. When Akkard saw her innocent expression, he laughed out loud, highly amused at her cuteness, and kissed Damia\u2019s collarbone.\u201cIt\u2019ll be gone within a week, so don\u2019t worry.\u201d\u2018Of course if there isn\u2019t another tryst before that.\u2019Akkard thought inwardly, coveting Damie\u2019s tender flesh. Her smooth yet moist skin felt like silk, her curvaceous and voluminous body, the shy character combined with the contradicting lewdness of her wonderful body needed to be tasted and savored a little bit more.\u201cAh.\u201dWhile she was distracted by the kiss marks, Akkard revealed his member, which had twitching and kicking to be acknowledged. Damia looked down reflexively and was horrified.Last night, it was dark and it was her first time, so she couldn\u2019t see what the man\u2019s equipment looked like. But now it was a sunny morning. Damia was surprised to see a man\u2019s penis naked for the first time in a bright place.\u201cHow could that have gone into my body!\u201dIt was a little scary. It was as huge as a child\u2019s forearm, it was veiny and ferocious-looking with its tip glistening with transparent fluid. It\u2019s scary to think that it\u2019s going to go into her most vulnerable place.Damia pulled back a little without realizing it. But Akkard immediately reached out and held her under her lap, and pulled her towards himself.\u201cCome now. You\u2019re gonna run away? That\u2019s too much.\u201dAkkard mounted above her, stroked her cheek and whispered. His eyes were expressionless as he was about to lose reason due his considerable desire. There was a creepy anticipation as if there was a wild wolf just around the corner.He must be going mad, Akkard endured it for too long. Damia was in pain in the aftermath of the day before, so he had paid special attention to caressing her and dedicating a lot of time to foreplay.Of course, the extra attention I gave her had nothing to do with having affection for Damia whom I met only just yesterday.His cock, which had been fully erected for a while, turned dark red because of too much blood. Finally, he took it to Damie\u2019s wet opening and Akkard began to shake his waist. Then the thick tip slipped on her arousal fluid, and began to rub through the inside of her soft petals.\u201cOh, it\u2019s rubbing\u2026It feels weird\u2026\u201dHe poked her mouth teasingly. Damia panted in anticipation and anxiety as if something thick and hot would rush in and crush her. Everytime she was afraid of being pierced Akkard\u2019s tip would instead press firmly on her clitoris and sweet sighs and coos naturally leaked out.\u201cIt\u2019s not weird, it\u2019s good. You\u2019ve already been trying to suck me in here.\u201dHe laughed as he penis stroked over her vagina, Akkard rubbing to his heart\u2019s content. Then, Damia\u2019s face lost in a haze of pleasure, had reddened to her neck and the red glow of arousal traveled to her breasts. It was such a look that made a man so dynamic.\u2018Oh, shit. It\u2019s cute.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Akkard pressed in his sturdy cock with the tip of his thumb before she could spit out a hot sound.\u201cAhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\u201dThe heavily caressed vagina was soft, but it was still ridiculously cramped. He furiously pushed his way into it.The ferocious, large pillar opened the inside without letting it go. The body, which had just come to know the man yesterday, complained of pain. Damia, whose first relationship last night came to mind, sobbed unconsciously and hung herself off Akkard\u2019s shoulders\u201cNo, I can\u2019t! It\u2019s too deep! It\u2019s in my belly!\u201d\u201cNo, you can do it. Yesterday you shook your waist greedily, swallowing mine. Don\u2019t you remember?\u201dUnfortunately, Damia\u2019s tears and erotic wails made him even more excited. No aphrodisiac was likely to work better than this.\u201cTry crying some more.\u201dAkkard, looking down at her, had a horribly serious and pained look. His sharp eyes frowned and his face cracked, full of concentration which was sensual but somehow aggressively intense. So Damia, who was more scared, cried out something she shouldn\u2019t have\u201cBut yours is so big\u2026 I feel like my stomach\u2019s full. \u201cFor a moment Akkad stopped breathing, without blinking he watched Damia\u2019s tearful visage, groping over his lower abdomen, burning into his retinas. The eyes were so intense that Damia literally felt like she was going in them.\u201c\u2026\u2026you really have a knack for pushing a man.\u201dWith his molars tightly clenched, to the point of a vein popping out, Akkard exhaled in a voice heavy in lust.He kissed Damie\u2019s eyes as if he were apologizing for what he was going to do. And he put his own, which has grown to its limit, and buried himself deep to the roots.\u201cAhhhhhhhh!\u201dDamia\u2019s straight toes stretched out and trembled in the air. His penis had entered a place where she didn\u2019t even know existed. The feeling of it flinching inside and moving little by little was still overwhelming. Damia gasped as if it had pierced her stomach.\u201cAh\u2026 \u2026okay, good Dami.\u201dAkkard groaned low in her ear. Her insides were truly fantastic. Her inner walls, burning with heated caresses, were tightening from all sides, tightly biting his member.How pretty her face is with tears in it. Both her eyes and body were inflamingly provoking, just putting it in felt injustice. However, this joyful passion was so restless.Damia felt his penis, buried in her narrowest and deepest depths, begin to move slowly. At first, Akkard\u2019s relaxed movements, which soothed her crying, did not last long. As soon as Damia tightened her insides, feeling heavy with an unfamiliar sensation, his impression was palpable.\u201cFuck.\u201dHe exhaled with a deep growl. His straight teeth seemed to draw blood, but he grabbed Damia\u2019s abdomen more feverently and began to shake her waist. His hard penis thrusted from the inside with a dominant force, and began to knead her insides pleasantly.Damia felt the slight pain from insertion was soon driven away by overpowering pleasure. As if reacting to the thrill of being dominated her body began to drip sweet honey continuously. This made it even more slippery, Akkard\u2019s movements smoother, faster and it began to poke inside in a tremendous amount.\u201cDon\u2019t tighten like that, I feel like you are trying to break me.\u201dAkkard inhaled deeper in his dark voice. It was as if she was protesting against the violent intruder but Akkard kept piercing and opening her inner walls wide mercilessly.Whenever that happened, Damia moaned as she felt white in front of her eyes.\u201cHuh, ah! Uhh!\u201d\u201cDo you feel it? You\u2019re holding me tight.\u201cAkkard dug in, spreading her legs wider. His penis that poked through the inside felt more severe. The thickness of it\u2019s veins itching her insides and the thickness of his roots were growing even thicker than the protruding tendon.Now the Akkard was moving as fast as a ram\u2019s waist. The inside of his penis swelled up quickly and the elation was palpable.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Because of this, the cream of her arousal thickened from the inside and clung to his lower abdomen. The sound of wetness, slapping of skin and the suction of squishing noises filled the room.Akkard whispered with a smile.\u201cCan you hear it? It\u2019s your easy lewd juices. You\u2019re looking very happy. You enjoy being a slut, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cN-no\u2026.. hah ahhh ahhh!\u201dDamia shook her head and tried to deny it. Then, Akkard bucked and dived in deep. He felt a sense of building elation as if his nerves were tinging with fire as the sound of a squish reached his ears from deep inside Damia.\u201cYou suck me all the way inside, keep gripping it\u2014yeah just like that. Just suck it in.

Her mind couldn\u2019t compute her ecstasy and her mouth was parched.Damia\u2019s lower abdomen seized and buckled. At the same time hot liquid rushed out of her as her legs trembled violently.\u201cAhhhhhh! Ahhhhhhhhhhh!!\u201d\u201cGood?\u201dAkkard bit her sweaty throat and smiled merrily. Then, his lower belly was pressed even closer to her and began to shake his waist, ferociously grinding with increasing intensity.Damia felt a thrilling throbbing deep inside her body with Akkard\u2019s viciously erotic movements. At first, it smoldered and sparked small flames, but then bursts out all over her body.\u201cAhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\u201dDamier culminated in his stuffing.

Her insides quaked with uncontrollable, strong contractions, and her thighs flinched and jerked around. The body of joy fluttered in a wave of satisfactory orgasms.Meanwhile, Akkard, sweating, moaned low and stopped moving. He was almost led into a pinnacle of release by Damia, literally swallowing him whole with her tightening erotic embrace.His pride would be injured if he was unbecomingly swayed by an innocent woman who didn\u2019t know how to handle men.\u2018I must admit this woman\u2026.\u2019Right now, she was naive, but what of a future, more experienced, mature Damia? Akkard had no doubt many would be kneeling before her.Akkard tongue filled Damia\u2019s mouth with a skillful kiss that made her pant. His hands played with her breasts\u2014pinching and tickling her erect nipples, causing her waist to bounce. Akkard took advantage of that gap and brought her knees up until they pressed against her soft breasts.\u201cWhat on earth is this\u2026?\u201dDamia shook her head with wet eyes in an overly embarrassing posture. She tried to escape but was powerless; Akkad grabbed her thigh firmly and pressed her tighter.Damia was acutely aware that her wet pussy was clearly exposed and still twitching finely with the aftertaste of its peak.It was apparent that it was glowing red because of that magical stimulation. I was so ashamed to imagine it that I couldn\u2019t lift my face.\u201cShh, you\u2019ll like it. Trust me.\u201dAkkard whispered, silently panting and barely taking his lips off of hers. Then he pushed his member back into her entrance, which was still in the afterglow of pleasure.\u201cHmmmm\u2026\u201dMaybe because of the position, Akkard\u2019s penis seemed to be coming in deeper than before. He swung in back and forth, stroking and piercing her insides. His engorged and thick head hit her g-spot relentlessly.\u201cOh! hooo \u2014Oh!\u201dFirecrackers were exploding in my head.His tireless, upright penis stimulated and stimulated my sensitive inner wall.I could feel my inner wall greedily clinging onto his organ.Akkard pushed into her silky embrace as hard as he could and fell into a dangerous addiction-like pleasure. He rubbed Damia\u2019s ample bosom and sucked her nipples vigorously. Then, deeper and fiercely, I pushed it into her as if hitting her innermost depths.\u201cAhhhhh!\u201d\u201cDamia, huh ah\u2026uh, that\u2019s so good!\u201dDamia half-folded posture under Akkard\u2019s weight gave him a glimpse of her red bottom.Seeing this, Akkard reached out one hand and grabbed her buttocks. The feverish heat of her soft ass was incredible.Akkard lifted her legs, clasped her ass with both hands, and pulled her butt closer\u2014deepening his insertion. He squeezed her ass cheeks, and Damia cried out, pushing his shoulders as he stroked and groped her bottom.\u201cAh, stop! Again\u2026 again ! I think I\u2019ll go. Aah!\u201dInstead, her screaming pleas ignited the man\u2019s lust. Akkard licked his lips, smacked her ass, and poked his cock inside more ferociously.\u201cTry begging more. Mor\u2026 more crying.\u201dThe sensation of being driven up and down so hard that her fine body hair stood up with goosebumps, and her whole being was on the brink. Spinning to the peak, her climax muted her vision.\u201cHahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\u2026\u201dNow, Akkard was at his limit. He pressed down the pitiful body of a rattling Damia. And shook his back as violently as he did.Damier sobbed under him without screaming. The pleasure was so excessive that it was close to pain and seemed to burn my nerves out of excess sensations.Every time his penis hit my depths, I couldn\u2019t see anything because my eyes were glistening and blurry with tears.\u201cAh, ah\u2026. Ughhhh!\u201dHis genitals thickened and expanded in Damia. With a sensuously furrowed brow, Akkard quickly pulled out his member, pumping it and expanding it to the limit.Soon his penis was pouring and spewing out semen. So strong was the stream, his semen splashed not only Damia\u2019s intended bosom but also her face. Damia closed her eyes.The hot, sticky feel of the man\u2019s body fluid clinging to her cheeks was embarrassing.\u201cHuuuuu.\u201dAkkard exhaled a huge sigh, with his forehead resting on her shoulder.When his head was up, he looked at Damia\u2019s face, smiled and reached out his hand to wipe away the semen.\u201cIt\u2019s an unfair world, that you\u2019re so pretty even when you are buried like this.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

So I took a quick breath while tilting her face down. Her heart, which had just escaped after being caught in a whirlpool of pleasure, was still fluttering violently.However, Akkard was in a slightly different condition. For a moment, he soaked in the afterglow, but he soon lifted his head proudly.Damia was surprised to feel his penis rubbed against her belly again. Akkard leaning against her trembling shoulder laughed slowly.\u201cSorry, but\u2026\u201dHe reached out and held her helpless body and turned her over.\u201c\u2026 I\u2019ve never been satisfied with doing it once.\u201dNow Damier raised her ass on the bed.

The thick roots crushed the swollen vaginal entrance, and his hard cock came in and out as if digging inside. Each time, there was a squeaking sound from Damia\u2019s wet pussy and the love juice flowed down her thighs.Damia\u2019s cheek rubbed against the sheet. Because of their postures, his penis seemed to pierce deeper. Not only that but as he shook his back and forth, large, heavy bull-like balls struck her labia and clitoris.My cheeks turned red because I was really ashamed to feel like we were mating dogs. Still, my body swelled up to a strange level with lascivious heat.Instinctually, she swayed her body along with Akkard\u2019s rhythm, and from behind came the sound of Akkard\u2019s laughter.\u201cMore than before, hoo woo (*panting*), you\u2019re tightening. Do you like getting it from behind?\u201d\u201cNo, Uh, ooohhhhhh ahh ahhhh!\u201d\u201cYour shaking ass says otherwise. You love this.\u201dAkkard grabbed her ass cheeks that moved as if she were flaunting and spread them apart to admire the lewd, lush scene.His own was ferociously going in and out of the crimson, narrow entrance. Her passageway, which had stretched to its limit, was admirably swallowing his own and drooling with delight.Just looking at it made his head warm. Akkard reached out from behind and pressed her breasts wildly, pinching the nipples and twirling them. And then, again and again, he thrusted her butt up, rewarded with erotic jiggles, and up into the depths of her core.\u201cAhh, haaa, aaah! Oh! Aah ooohh!\u201dEvery time that happened, the sweet panting that came out of Damia and the murky moans of uncontrollable pleasure sweetened Akkard\u2019s ears.Overwhelmed with excitement, Akkard clung to her back and teased her clit.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Ah!\u201d\u201cRelax, you said no, but it\u2019s too tight. Oh?\u201dAkkad wickedly reached out to her labia and caressed the clitoris hidden in it. Then, as if an electric current was flowing, my legs were stricken and couldn\u2019t stand.Damier pulled her buttocks back to avoid a mischievous touch there. But this time, a large, hard penis poked deeper into her, blocking her escape. She fell into tears without knowing what to do with the rhythmic arousing movements going back and forth.\u201cOh. No\u2026 If you do that at the same time\u2026 AHaaaa-hoo!His thumb rubbed a little harder on the swollen clitoris, and Akkard\u2019s hot pillar stuck all the way to Damia\u2019s innermost point and stabbed it.

Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\u2026!\u201dEvery time he poked my convulsiving vaginal mouth, his eyes flashed. Whenever Akkard penis rubbed the inner wall that became too sensitive, I felt the pleasure of hell. A sense of helplessness caused my body to bounce wildly.\u201cOh, did you cum again?\u201dAkkard whispered, feeling the tightness of the person who was biting me. Her inner folds that squeezed his large organ in a tight embrace were really fantastic.This is purely a physical relationship that only pursues pleasure, but when have you ever been so satisfied?Such a pity that I could only enjoy it a few times. Even though Akkard didn\u2019t love Damia, he decided to be more generous to her.This time, Damia\u2019s loose body was slanted to the side.\u201cAh, again\u2026!!\u201dDamie\u2019s face turned pale due to his tireless energy. She looked up at the Akkard imploringly under her wet eyelashes.Pleadingly, her face looked pitiful. When Akkard saw it, he twisted his lips and laughed.He breathed a sigh and kissed her cheek as if she was a precious person to him. Then he grabbed her thigh up and dug roughly into her.\u201cHuh! Ah. Stop it\u2026 ..ah!!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be so pampered. You still have more orgasms in you. Look, you\u2019re dripping so much liquid.\u201dAkkard whispered in a low voice thick with pleasure, rubbing the point of their connection. His fingertips caressed, groped, and stretched the soaked lips of her lower mouth as it was swallowing his pillar; it was strange and shameful. However, whenever his fingertips were clinging over the clitoris, her body trembled.\u201cNo, no\u2026 I can\u2019t do it anymore.\u201dDamia cried and shook her head. This ruthless sense of churning and driving her body crazy was terrifying.I was afraid that all the cells in my head would burn white with pleasure; becoming a fool.But Akkard did not grant her appeal. From behind, he clasped her ass cheeks, kissing her with a violent sensuousness. His passion ate up Damia\u2019s pitiful entreaties.\u201cUmhhhhhhhhhhh\u2026\u201dHer white fingertips fluttered in the air as if asking for help\u2014Akkard, who held that weak hand on the sheet, pushed in harder and harder inside her.Damia couldn\u2019t escape from him until the morning sun that had risen finally disappeared over the mountain.***Damia woke up to the sound of rustling cloth. Over the crumpled sheets, she could see the back of a man covered in clothes.The broad, firm shoulders, strong waist, and muscular thighs gave off a vigorous wildness. It was an impressive transformation, with only clothes he turned from a man that shook his waist like a beast, into the image of a refined gentleman.At this time, he looked back while adjusting a crumpled cravat.\u201cDid you wake up?\u2019His tone went back to one of cold respect.Damia lowered her eyes to the sense of distance she felt from his voice. As she tried to get up in bed casually, she groaned in pain.\u201cUgh\u2026..\u201dThe man\u2019s fierce greed had left no part of her body unharmed. In particular, the gap between her legs where he entered was so sore, Damia thought her body was broken.Akkad also clearly witnessed her pain. However, he did not say empty words asking Damia if she was okay.That\u2019s because Damia would make him responsible for the pain and demand compensation for giving her body.The prizes women wanted weren\u2019t simple, like money or jewelry. It would have been cleaner if it had been, but what they asked of Akkard was usually love.\u2018I slept with you, so love me. Treat me differently than other women.\u2019That was their real intention. And Akkard was very tired of this demand. Therefore, he felt the need to draw some lines with Damia in advance.Although I enjoyed playing with fire, my heart will never get entangled.He did not feel affection for others. Akkard, who had just spent a hot night mixing with Damia\u2019s flesh and tangling with her tongue, now felt apathetic towards her, as if she was a random person on the street.This was an innate personality flaw Akkard had since he was born.\u201cIt was fun last night, but Lady Damia\u2026\u201dThe cold-smiling Akkard had started to speak but didn\u2019t continue because Damia beat him to it.\u201c\u2026.I also enjoyed myself last night. Lord Akkad.\u201dWith her long eyelashes down, Damia blushed shyly. Then she looked at Akkard\u2019s stony eyes and said refreshingly:\u201cThank you for the good memories, and I hope you\u2019ll return home safely after going to work. I\u2019m going to get going now.\u201d\u2026 What the hell is this woman talking about?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although it was wrapped nicely, her meaning was clear. It meant that she wouldn\u2019t see him anymore.There was no way Akkard could not have known this. He was used to getting rid of a crying and clinging woman. But this was the first time that this situation had been reversed, and he froze for a while.In the meantime, Damia, now wearing clothes, quietly walked out of the bedroom.\u201cThen, goodbye.\u201dLast night the woman who had been so prettily crying and disheveled under him left.Without looking back.Click-His bedroom door closed with a dry, short sound where Damia had slipped out.Left alone, Akkard glared fiercely at the door.It couldn\u2019t be. Last night was absolutely hot.Damia would have had to melt like chocolate put in front of the fireplace and stick to me.Suddenly a thought flashed through his mind, and he looked around the bedroom. Looking for the object Damia must have left behind.Sometimes there were such women who used the tactic of deliberately leaving small belongings such as earrings and hairpins in his bedroom, so they would have an excuse to meet with him again when he returned them. Some of the more provocative objects he recalled was underwear.But Damia Primula didn\u2019t.There was nothing she left. Akkard was amazed, although she was shy, she was meticulous about taking all her clothes.\u201cNonsense.\u201dOnly then did Akkard realize.Damia was sincere.You were coyly crying under me and and going crazy last night, but when you wake up you say goodbye, just like that?An angry dry laugh came out of the mouth of a stuffy Akkard.\u201cHa!\u201dThe world\u2019s renowned casanova, Akkard Valerian, was now abandoned after a passionate night.And to Damia Primula, who didn\u2019t know the man until yesterday!With his eyes darkened with rage, Akkard glared fiercely at the empty bed that she had escaped. His arrogance, which had soared as high as the sky and his pride as a prominent and handsome man had completely crumbled.Naturally, there was only one question that came to mind in his chaotically confused mind.Who the hell is this woman who devoured him whole?As soon as the question crossed his mind, Akkard suddenly realized.They had spent the whole day rolling around, and he knew nothing about Damia Primula.He always thought that he was in control of the relationship and thought he could always ask her if he could be bothered to. So, instead of properly getting to know her before their romp, he had first sought out her delectable body.But now, left alone, Arkad realized that he had been seriously mistaken. The shock tingling the back of his head was terribly unpleasant and alien. His wicked temper started to boil.\u201c\u2026\u2026 impudent, who wants to end this?\u201dIt was natural for the superior to abandon the inferior. Therefore, Akkard was always in the position of throwing away. No one dared to turned their back on him first.That Damia Primula was no exception. Akkard decided to return the humiliation, contempt, and anger he was feeling.\u201cYou\u2019re going to wish that you were never born.\u201dAkkad muttered coldly. This wasn\u2019t the end. When Damia was crying prettily and grabbing his foot, pleading him to stay\u2014That would be the real end of this relationship.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was Akkard Valerian who she happened to meet two days ago.Let\u2019s rewind and go back two days, first.It was the day of the farewell party of the second son of the Marquis Roysten, Kael Roysten. He was honored to be selected to go to Daeshin for formal paladin training and would depart soon.Marquis Roysten held a grand farewell party for his second son. So Damia Primula had to take part in the event because she was a long-time childhood friend of Kael.\u201cDamia, you\u2019re here!\u201dToday\u2019s main character, Kael, has not yet been seen. Instead, it was a black-haired nobleman who welcomed Damia. He smiled brightly as if he was happy to meet Damia here. But from the moment she saw him, Damia\u2019s eyes sank.\u201cBrother Cesare. You\u2019re here first.\u201dDamia recited a formal greeting. Cesare was a bloodless step-brother brought in by her stepmother.Living in the same mansion, you would think they would see each other every day, and it would be weird to be delighted to see your sister at a party. But, of course, that was the average brother and sister.\u201cThat\u2019s great. Well, then, I\u2019ll see you around.\u201dDamia tried to keep her distance from him. But the cunning Cesare didn\u2019t let her go.He held Damia\u2019s arm gently. And as soon as Damia felt regret, his beautiful face suddenly came into her view.\u201cIt\u2019s been such a long time since we attended a party, Damia, and you look a little excited. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re leaving this brother here. You\u2019re making me sad.\u201dCesare\u2019s lips, which were red as much as a woman\u2019s, pressed against her cheek under the guise of a fraternal kiss. The touch of the cold, soft lips was familiar.When Damia was still a young girl, Cesare would sometimes kiss her this way, adoring her.But Damia was now an adult, and this greeting was rather inappropriate. Especially given that they were siblings without blood.\u201c\u2026 Brother Cesare.\u201dDamia touched her cheek and frowned. Cesare smiled like a fox and quickly deflected her future protest.\u201cI\u2019m sincere. I don\u2019t think we need to be so polite between us. I\u2019m your brother, aren\u2019t I? Damia.\u201dCesare gave her a grim look and said, \u201cIf you keep doing this, I\u2019ll be disappointed.\u201dHis eyes were watery blue, so the youthful, playful expression suited him well. Any woman could have held her breast with maternal love and would willingly forgive Cesare.But Damia knew him well. At first glance, Cesare seemed gentle and selfless, but in fact, it was quite manipulative. She was familiar with his way of slowly tightening the web with a trap if he wanted something.And Damia recently had an unsettling gut feeling\u2014the intuition that his invisible spiderwebs were draped little by little under her feet until one day she was strung up, upside down in front of Cesare and would be eaten alive.\u201cIn brother\u2019s eyes, it seems I still look like your immature younger sister, right?\u201dDamia spoke with a gentle smile. Her unexpected counterattack was met with silence. She feigned innocence as if she didn\u2019t know Cesare\u2019s thoughts, but Damia didn\u2019t miss the chance to push Cesare away.\u201cIt\u2019s such a shame. All the good memories are piled up so thick that they cover our eyes, and now we\u2019ll never be able to see each other as a man or woman.\u201dAfter finishing talking, Damia gracefully stepped up and kissed Cesare on the cheek. Damia\u2019s kiss returned his actions with an air of mockery.Her meaning was clear. If he wanted to treat her as a younger sister, he had to stick to his position. Later, if he asked for marriage with a voice like, \u2018Actually, I to you\u2026\u2026\u2019, it was deceitful.When he wanted to kiss her, he used \u2018you\u2019re my younger sister\u2019 card, but other than that, didn\u2019t Damia looked like a woman to his eyes? Everything was always in Cesare\u2019s favor; he had an escape and an excuse for each of his dubious actions.Therefore, Damia wanted to bring it to light and break his double standards. She was trying to give him an ultimatum\u2014he should choose only one of the two.How could Cesare not know this? Damia\u2019s lips touched and fell from his face, and laughter evaporated.\u201cYou really are.\u201dThe real face of Cesare appeared from behind his usual mask as he glanced at her. Then he pulled up the corners of his mouth smoothly, and his eyes sharped.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

For a moment, his genuine intentions were revealed. Then his usual mask of softness slipped on to his face again.\u201cLady Damia.\u201dHe stepped away from Damia, he leaned forward and reached out his hand. Then, holding Damia\u2019s warm hand, he kissed it softly as it was expected of unrelated single men and courtable ladies in high society.\u201cYou\u2019re as beautiful as a dream tonight. Please have a good time during your stay.\u201dDamia laughed shortly. Cesare had just declared through his actions that he would treat her as a woman, not his sister.Then she had no choice but to protect herself with all her might. Damia smiled as if she hadn\u2019t heard his declaration of war. And deliberately spoke Kael\u2019s name in front of him.\u201cThank you, brother. So, today\u2019s star is, uh, there\u2019s one, right? I\u2019d like to say goodbye before Kael leaves.\u201dCesare was still smiling. But Damia could see it. His eyes, which were the color of pale water until earlier, were now frozen like winter icicles.There was only one reason why she got a reaction out of the indifferent and cold-hearted Cesare. It was because he hated Kael Roysten, the main character of today\u2019s farewell party.It was a matter of course. Kael was Damia\u2019s first and only love.\u201c\u2026Kael? Right\u2026 You don\u2019t know when you\u2019ll see him after he leaves tomorrow. Of course, you want to say your greetings to him.\u201dCesare replied with a fierce smile that smelled bloody.Damia sighed inwardly at the sight of his expression.As expected, Cesare must have been involved in Kael\u2019s departure. He was not a man to let Damia go without a fight.But Damia wasn\u2019t subject to Cesare\u2019s dirty ticks; he had targeted Kael instead.Even though she knew all this, she lowered her eyes and asked a favor from Cesare with her head bowed.\u201cI\u2019d like to say goodbye to Kael. So please tell me where he is \u2026Please Chesare, brother.\u201dDamia wish she could have been steadfast in front of Cesare until the end, but she let her voice tremble slightly. For this reason, it became a pitiful plea.She had no choice but to do so. Cesare was good at controlling people. He had patiently and meticulously made Kael admire him and look up to him.Kael, who had been isolated from the Roysten Marquis, was lonely and naive. So he fell for Cesare\u2019s trick. His application for the paladin\u2019s entrance test, which he was not interested in, and his departure from the North were all the results of his manipulation as Cesare being Kael\u2019s \u201crespectful older brother.\u201dSo Damia was afraid. Kael didn\u2019t like this grand banquet. He would leave tomorrow, so Cesare didn\u2019t need to keep up with pretense.Cesare could crush Kael in a few words if he so desired.\u2018Then I won\u2019t even be able to say my last goodbye to Kael\u2026 \u2026.\u2019Damia had no choice but to admit defeat. She lost to Cesare.For Kael had picked him over Damia.So Dami bowed her head and begged the victor to be generous. To put an end to her long, unrequited love.\u201cOkay.\u201dCesare, staring at Damia with an unreadable look, opened his mouth. Fortunately, his gaze at Damia was softer than before.\u201cYou\u2019d better take it easy at this point.\u201d\u2018For you and me.\u2019Damia heard his unspoken threat.Damia checked the direction he was pointing and turned.The sticky gaze on her back seemed to squeeze her neck. Damia hurriedly headed for the garden without regard for how she might have looked.She had often come to play since she was young at the neighboring Roysten estate with Kael, so she knew the landscape as clearly as if it were the back of her hand.Damia crossed a flower bed full of roses, rounded the corner of the mansion, and passed a fountain with an angel statue.Before long, Damia stopped in front of the pretty pond and raised her head, searching.Then she spotted a young man with blue hair standing alone on the balcony on the second floor above the lake, full of stars.\u201cKael.\u201dDamia carefully called the name of the man she had loved for ten years.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A refreshing smile hung over his face as if it were a breeze when he found Damia.\u201cDamia? Oh my god!\u201dKael jumped over the railing without any hesitation. Despite his height, he was gentle in his movements as he landed on the ground. The man looked down at Damie and nagged her affectionately.\u201cLong time no see. Why haven\u2019t you sent me a letter?\u201d\u201cJust. It\u2019s been a while.\u201dA sad smile came over Damia\u2019s face. After she heard that Kael was becoming a paladin knight, she felt a great loss and fell into a deep depression. Under such circumstances, she had no confidence to keep up the farce and face Kael as his childhood friend as she did before.\u201cI see. You didn\u2019t come to play like before, and I thought something had happened. I was worried.\u201dThe voice that touched my ears was warm. Kael was a little indecisive, but it was because he was a friendly person.Dami had fallen in love with him because of the warmth of that smile and his kind disposition.Damia looked up at him without a word. The way he spoke was as if he was upset with her, but Kael smiled down on her pleasantly. So Dami knew with even more clarity:She\u2019s simply not that important to him.\u201cYou heard the news, right? Me. I passed the test\u2026 I want to finish my training as soon as possible and leave to clean up the \u2018contamination\u2019 that is rampant in the South. To help the frail Saint.\u201dKael\u2019s gray eyes were all shining with anticipation of a new future. In particular, the eyes filled with longing for the Saint seemed to be screaming at Damia. The fact slowly and cruelly mutilated Damia\u2019s chest.\u201cBut today is the last day. You came to my farewell party. I\u2019m so glad. Lady Damia! I will never forget you even after I join the church.\u201dKael displayed the unique greeting of a knight who draws a sign in front of his chest and bends his waist. Of course, it was a joke, but it looked great on him, making him look noble. The uniform of the church is neat, except for the ceases made by all his formal greetings.Damia\u2019s eyes were blurred as she watched it. According to the code of the church, a paladin could not get married. It was to prevent a conflict of family, politics, loyalty, and faith\u2014one should only be devoted to God and not be muddied by affection.By tomorrow, Kael will be leaving for the Great Goddess of War, participate in a ceremony to join the Saint\u2019s Knighthood, and Damia will lose her chance forever. She will never be his lover or wife.Never\u201cKael.\u201dDamia called his name with a cracking heart.\u201cHuh? What\u2019s wrong Damia? What\u2019s with that look on your face?\u201dA dull Kael was still smiling brightly in this situation without even an inkling about what was about to come out of her mouth.I couldn\u2019t let Kael go without confessing.Damia knew himself well. Her long-standing unrequited love had already festered to the point of pain and was bound to become a deadly poison unless it exploded.\u201c\u2026 \u2026You asked me before, didn\u2019t you, Kael? \u2018Why aren\u2019t you dating?'\u201d\u201cHmm? Oh, yeah\u2026. I think I remember. Didn\u2019t you say there was someone you liked?\u201dKael, who had been agonizing to recall the conversation for a while, raised his head as if it finally came to mind.Damia\u2019s desperate eyes looked into Kael\u2019s face. He looked back into her beautiful eyes as if he had been possessed for a while, and then suddenly, he hardened with a late realization.\u201cNo way! The man Dami said you liked\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dThough he was confessed to by Damia, the North\u2019s greatest beauty, Kael\u2019s face did not look a bit pleased. Instead, he looked as if he was being punished. His face was distorted by surprise and guilt.Damia couldn\u2019t have done anything. She managed to swallow the hot tears in her heart, and the taste of the broken heart in her mouth was so salty that her face unknowingly distorted. But she managed to split her chest and open it up.\u201cIt\u2019s you I like, Kael Roysten. I\u2019ve always liked you.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I don\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t even know what to say, and I\u2019m so sorry for all this time.\u201dAn apology trickled out of his mouth. Kael stammered out of embarrassment.\u201cWell, you know, I\u2019m going to be a paladin\u2026 And you know. The knights of the Saint can\u2019t get married.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dDamia answered back with unfocused eyes. She had just clearly witnessed him stepping back as if Kael wanted to run away at once.\u00a0It was a more pronounced refusal than simple words.\u201cI don\u2019t hate you, Damia. I\u2019m telling you, but it\u2019s so sudden, and I have a dream\u2026 I don\u2019t think I can give up now. Sorry, Damia.\u201d\u201cI understand what you mean. So stop it, Kael.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026but I\u2019m sorry.\u201dIs there anything more miserable than the constant word of apology from the person you confessed to? There was the sound of my heart breaking into pieces.Damia whispered with her eyes cast down before tears came out.\u201cIt\u2019s all right. You don\u2019t have to be sorry to me. Because\u00a0it\u2019s not the fault of the one who doesn\u2019t love me.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t do it on purpose Dami. I\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cOkay, can you go now? I want to be alone for a moment. Please.\u201dDamia\u2019s voice was relatively calm, thanks to her desperate efforts. Nevertheless, Kael could not quickly get out of her way. It was only natural, considering his weak nature.\u201cDamia\u2026 I\u2019m not just spouting empty words, but you\u2019re a really good woman. So if you just look away, you\u2019ll be able to meet someone who\u2019ll like you as much as you deserve.\u201dKael, you want me not to be offended about what you just said! The direction this conversation was turning was awful. Find another man \u2014 when\u00a0I\u2018ve been struggling with my love for you for ten years! It was more comforting than you didn\u2019t say anything.It was Dami\u2019s choice whether to continue to like Kael even after she was rejected or not. It was not an issue he could argue with.Furthermore, with her step-brother\u2019s cunning influence, Kael was probably trying to push her towards him.If Damia stays like this, she\u2019ll cry, get angry, and look ugly. So Dami broke away.\u201cPlease, Kael! Don\u2019t make meany more miserable;\u00a0just go away!\u201dAt the end of my speech, I ended up bursting into tears. The crying from a mature Damia worked. Kael backed away in a fit of fright.Damia, who finally forced him to step away, turned her back as he waited.Kael hesitated to see if it was okay to go as it was, but it was apparent that an angry plea for him to leave would be handed down from her back. Adding to the pressure that he had just refused to her confession, Kael finally lost the courage to stick around.\u201c\u2026 \u2026 I\u2019m sorry Damia. Please forget about a guy like me as soon as possible.\u201dKael, muttering with a tearful face, turned around. And he ran away like he was running away from Damia and her feelings for him.Damier crouched down and heard his footsteps fade away.It was the sound of a long one-sided painful love breaking apart. It was also the sound of Kael stepping on the pieces of her broken heart.I was in love for ten years. Ever since the day he wiped away her tears with his clumsy hands and gave her the small glass bead that he cherished as a treasure.At that time, the most important person to Kael was his childhood friend Damia. But not now after ten years.\u00a0Kael had just broken their relationship in a very amiable and painful way.\u2018You want me to meet a good person as soon as possible?\u2019Dami remembered the words that had left her in tears. At first glance, it seemed like comforting words spoken for Damia benefit, but it was for Kael himself. To relieve the guilt of refusing Damia.So Dami was even more miserable.I already knew that it was a love that could not be returned.However,\u00a0Kael\u2019s attitude toward the confession was more irresponsible and cruel than expected.Damia murmured, stifling her trembling body with a sob.\u201cIf that\u2019s what you want, Kael, then I\u2019ll do it.\u201dI caught a glimpse of a man\u2019s back disappearing over a ridge just in time as if he had listened to her. Unfortunately, it was not Kael.\u201cCesare\u2026\u201dDamia stared at him with tearful eyes.Even though I could only see his back, I could tell in an instant.By now, Cesare will be smiling contently like a cat licking the cream. You feel like you\u2019ve already got your hands on me.I\u2019ve had enough of it all. The unrequited love that\u2019s made me crawl on my knees for too long,\u00a0Cesare\u2019s trap that has been so cunningly tightened around me, and the love that\u2019s never been returned.Suddenly, I thought it would be better if I threw it all away and ruined it all.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Fortunately, it was her friend Cecil who welcomed her first.\u201cDamia! What the hell were you doing? It\u2019s been two hours since you got here. I\u2019ve been looking for you for a long time. \u201cShe frowned and grumbled as she studied my expression. Then she asked with a serious look.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with your face? Did you cry?\u201d\u201cIs it too obvious?\u201dDami asked frankly without denying it. Cecil knew about her painful crush anyway. So there was no need to hide it from her.\u201cWhy are you crying stupidly? Ugly!\u201dCecil snorted. But contrary to her rather chilly tone of voice, her eyes were visibly concerned about her dear friend.Cecil, who was not honest,\u00a0had a cold expression and attitude, which made it easy for others to misunderstand her. But Dami knew she was warmer than anyone else.\u2018Dami\u2026\u00a0I am so sorry.\u2019Cecil knew what \u201cKael Roysten\u2019s farewell party\u201d meant to Dami. No matter how much I nagged next to her,\u00a0Damia\u2019s unrequited love showed no sign of ending. Before meeting Dami, I didn\u2019t know that a heart could end up as minced meat from pain alone.Dami was obviously heartbroken. Cecil took Damia\u2019s hand to the lounge heavy with a painful sympathy. Dami cried, and Cecil carefully fixed her slightly broken makeup.\u201cWhat are you doing? Makeup isn\u2019t a drag-and-go thing to do\u2014especially with that face? If you\u2019re going to use it like that,\u00a0give it to me.\u201dCecil hastened to console Damie. Of course, it was a joke, but Damia\u2019s face was so pretty that even I couldn\u2019t get used to it and would be in awe of her at times.Her hair, red as a rose, was a vivid color that was extremely rare in the black-haired North. But the face in between was much more colorful than that. The unique white skin of the North Nobility was filled with elegantly arched eyebrows, large blue eyes, and thick red lips, making it hard to unsee.\u2018Kael Roysten is unbelievable; how can you let this face go?\u2019 Cecil thought he was truly unique.If Kael hadn\u2019t been swayed by Cesare\u2019s tricks, he would have knelt at Damia\u2019s feet.\u201c\u2026I, do I look okay now?\u201dDami raised her head and asked carefully.I couldn\u2019t help crying, but I didn\u2019t want to look pitiful now. I didn\u2019t want to show that to Kael, who just rejected me, or even Cesare, who would rejoice thinking it was his turn.Cecil, who knew Damia\u2019s heart well, looked at her with a sad look.Damia\u2019s appearance was especially miserable right after she cried. Because of this, her face felt uselessly decadent, and her beauty was fatal.\u2018Don\u2019t people usually get ugly when they cry?\u2019Cecil pouted at Dami at the unfairness, but it\u2019s a good thing to look pretty.She\u2019d rather have a decent guy grab Damia with this chance.Otherwise, Dami\u2019s personality won\u2019t be able to escape her long-standing crush and just wither away.But not a weirdo. Idiots particularly targeted Damia. Like her step-brother Cesare.Knowing this, Cecil frowned upon the unexpected guest who had just arrived at the banquet hall. She felt the need to warn her vulnerable friend in advance.\u201cDami, be careful today. Do you know who\u2019s out there right now?\u2019\u201cWho?\u201dDamia asked back listlessly. There was no sign of her willingness to defend herself. A frowning Cecil spat out a more assertive tone.\u201cDon\u2019t be surprised. You know that arrogant rascal from the capital. Do you remember?\u00a0Why Count Fisher\u2019s wife asked the youth to be careful and to ask the young ladies to be cautious?\u201d\u201c\u2026Lord Akkard of the Valerian Duke?

The capital\u2019s Akkard, the sex stallion! He\u2019s in the banquet hall right now. Louise Perira\u2019s older brother brought him here because he\u2019s close to him. I\u2019ve seen him with my own eyes!\u201d\u201cWhat a surprise. I thought he wouldn\u2019t get to the North until at least next week. Because of the rampant \u2018contamination\u2019 in the South.\u201dDami muttered blankly. The richest Southern nobleman, Akkard Valerian, was a well-known celebrity all over the kingdom. As well as his appearance and charm, the Akkard was full of attractive qualifications.His sister, Sienna Valerian, was the most famous fortune-teller in the kingdom. The queen was so fond of her that it was widely rumored that she wouldn\u2019t let go of her.Akkard was even the most trusted right-hand man of the current Crown Prince and even served as the royal knights head. Such a prominent figure was briefly assigned to the North. So the change caused havoc in the stagnate boring North.\u201cAre you listening to me, Damia? Akkard Valerie is here!\u201d\u201cYes, even I\u2019ve heard of him.\u201dEven though he was the talk of the town, Dami wasn\u2019t very interested, even though the figure was outside the door. It was a natural reaction for a woman who had just been heartbroken. But Cecil, who watched her from the sidelines, was literally burning inside.\u201cGet a hold of yourself, Dami. Didn\u2019t you hear the rumors? Akkard is a notorious playboy. You have a pretty face, though your insides are broken. And you have a great figure! It\u2019s like food for a person like Akkard! Do you understand me?\u201dDamia, who was severely reprimanded by Cecil, blinked her eyes blankly. Only belatedly did Cecil\u2019s words crawl into her absent head, but there was no particular excitement.\u2018Akkard Valerie wants to eat me?\u2019\u2018What can\u2019t be done? Wouldn\u2019t that be better? If such a charming man only meets with the best beauties in the capital and he still wants me\u2026 then maybe it means I have a little bit of a female charm?\u2019Damia thought with desperation. Her self-esteem was literally bottoming out now.But her low self-regard was only natural when she only looked at one man for so long, and now endured such a miserable refusal.Her eyes told her she looked like a bald clown in a wig.Is that why? I wanted the attention of another man, whom I usually wouldn\u2019t want. Even so, I wanted to feel keenly that I was an attractive woman.But the young men in the North were now clinging to Cesare.They dared not approach Damia because of Cesare\u2019s tact.Cesare was very crafty in isolating her.\u2018But if it\u2019s Lord Akkard from the capital\u2026 \u2026it may be different.\u2019Damia\u2019s eyes deepened. Akkard Valerian was a big shot like Cesare. Besides, he wouldn\u2019t know much about the northern social circles, so if she seduced him now, her success rate would be high.By now, Cesare will be extremely pleased to have \u2018captured\u2019 the rejected and isolated Damia. It would be quite a pleasant revenge if she could make Cesare squeal in front of her.It wasn\u2019t just Cesare\u2019s fault that her long unrequited love was finally rejected. But he was obviously responsible, as well.\u2018So I hope Cesare is also sick. Like me.\u2019Dami glanced at the mirror. The face reflected in it was still beautiful. At least I could catch Akkard\u2019s eye.People only saw the appearance of anyone. She had such a charming face and figure, that people assumed she was a femme fatale that wrapped powerful men around her evil sexy fingers.But Damia\u2019s inner self was actually quite simple and innocent. She had been preoccupied with unrequitedly loving her childhood friend for ten years and never played with another man.Damia Primula was such an uninteresting woman.Because of this, men were quickly disappointed by her gorgeous looks and incongruent personality.Akkard would be no different. But he was an outsider who had just arrived from the province and didn\u2019t know Damia very well.But for a moment, I could pretend. To be as colorful, light, and loose as the women he used to enjoy in the capital.\u201cLet\u2019s go, Cecil. To welcome the famous Akkard!\u201dDami, who drank all the champagne in the lounge, stood up. Cecil frowned upon it but did not oppose it.\u201cOkay, Dami, don\u2019t do useless things instead.\u201dCecil felt the need to change Damia\u2019s mood, who looked depressed. So I readily agreed to the suggestion of going to see Akkard.They left the lounge and settled behind an unnoticed pillar. People were all enraptured by the sudden appearance of a celebrity from the capital. Thanks to you, it was not so difficult to observe the Akkadian from afar.\u201cHey, that\u2019s him. See?\u201dDamia looked in the direction Cecil had pointed.Even if you didn\u2019t point him out, I could have spotted him; Akkard Valerian was too conspicuous.So Damia was able to recognize him quickly.\u2018..- ..-of-fact.\u2019When I see something so beautiful, I forget all my worries for a moment. Funny, it was true.Damia opened her eyes wide with pure admiration.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

So his sparkling silver hair and his charmingly tanned southern skin made him stand out even more.His manly, clear-cut, and defined face was perfect enough to be shocking. Especially his confidence\u2014 as if he very well knew how good he looked\u2014 lent him a relaxed smile even amidst a strange place, giving him a halo.Whenever he laughed, his sensual lips were raised, his bright white teeth showed, his strong jaw was highlighted, and his protruding adam\u2019s apple bobbled sensationally.His sturdy physique, wild beauty, and muscular chests melted the women around him. Their knees softened, their voices got higher and were flushed with smilies.\u201cWell\u2026 his face isn\u2019t too bad. Of course, his body\u2026\u201dEven Cecil, who had a very, very bad opinion of Akkard, was forced to admit he possessed beauty and magnetism.A fresh laugh unintentionally bubbled forth from Dami at Cecil\u2019s displeased tone and resentful but sincere compliment.It was just then. As if hearing Damia\u2019s laughter, Akkard turned his head toward her direction.\u2018Hmm?\u2019Dami blinked her eyes. Was she seeing things?Akkard was looking at her, and his eyes grew with a spark.His purple eyes, shining under his silver eyelashes, were so vividly sharp that Damia felt dizzy but couldn\u2019t look away under the weight of his exquisite attention.His eyes scanned her slim face, alternately looking at her cat-like eyes and red lips before going down to her chest. Then, as if he was satisfied with the view, he smiled with erotic meaning. His right eyebrow slightly lifted, beckoning with his pleased grin.\u201c\u2026\u2026what is he\u2026? Isn\u2019t he flirting with you right now?\u201dCecil noticed the strange atmosphere right away. She narrowed her eyes at the electrifying air and stood in front of her as if to protect Damia. Damia shook her head and said,\u201cI\u2019m fine, Cecil.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean it\u2019s fine? I knew this would happen\u2014Akkard Valerian?\u2014No. Never. Dami, you\u2019re the only one who\u2019s gonna get hurt. You know that right?\u201dCecil clenched her jaw behind her fan, clearly stressed.Cecil had a protective, strong and defensive personality, often wrapping Damia up like a mother hen.Damia smiled silently.She knew what Cecil was worried about. But what Dami needed now was not caution. It was a night of hot fire that would restore her wounded pride and reheat a cold heart.It would also be an act of small revenge against the men who treated her heart recklessly. Cesare, who isolated her and Kael, who was burdened by her feelings and tried to attach her to others, as if her heart was their own and something to play with.Damia decided to choose a path that no one would expect to show off her independence and remind them that her heart and body were hers alone.Now that the choice is in front of her eyes, there was no need to hesitate.\u2018Your heart doesn\u2019t even need to be involved. He won\u2019t even want it, no strings attached, right? He\u2019s going back to the capital soon anyway, so there won\u2019t be any trouble.\u2019Inner thoughts she didn\u2019t even know she had come to her. Damia listened to her whispers.\u201cCecil.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t feel well. I\u2019d rather go home. I\u2019m sorry, but could you find my coachman and bring him?\u201d\u201cTsk! Who do you think I am, your maid? Okay, just wait a little bit; I\u2019ll be back.\u201dAs usual, Cecil clicked her teeth but immediately turned away and disappeared. She thought Dami was embarrassed to go home but was worried that she would make a mistake if Damia stayed as she was, drunk and heartbroken.\u2018I am sorry, Cecil.\u2019Damia murmured as she gazed at Cecil\u2019s vanishing back.Then she turned my head and looked at Akkard.Akkard, who was laughing and surrounded by people, also looked at her. His deep gaze licked her skin up and down so openly.Dami\u2019s cheeks flushed with heat at his brazen lustful stare that threatened to devour her at any moment, but she tried hard to smile lightly back.Trying to look as familiar to these temptations and encounters as much as possible.Luckily, Akkard noticed she welcomed and enjoyed his attention. However, he did not approach Damia even though he ogled her.Damia stood there, awkward and shy, looking back at him and internally praying.\u2018In times like these\u2026 what should I do?\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Men and women accustomed to playing at night evaluated each other and confirmed their interest with their eyes and telling glances.The ball was long enough to be boring, so there was no need to hurry or fret. Rather, Akkard was often treated like a celebrity at these events and planned to enjoy the pampering.Therefore, Akkard was thinking of staying a little more at his first northern socialite\u2019s banquet and then approach Damia when the night was ripe.But Damia\u2019s position was a little different. She didn\u2019t have much time. She didn\u2019t know when Cecil would return if she hesitated.The walls of the people around the Akkard were too thick. It seemed difficult to penetrate the crowd between them.\u2018I\u2019d have to get him to come to me somehow.\u2019Damia, who had never attempted to seduce a man, was a little embarrassed.Suddenly it occurred to me that he looked down at my chest, and I mentally laughed savagely. Then should we at least loosen the button on the bodice that was binding our breasts a little?\u2018Ah!\u2019Damia\u2019s face suddenly brightened as she was looking down.She picked up honey wine from a tray of servants passing by just in time. And she waited for the far-sighted Akkard\u2019s attention.After waiting for a while, he finally looked her way.Damia grinned at Akkard, not missing her chance. His eyes rested for a moment on her smiling face as if a rose was brightly blooming.\u2018Okay, now.\u2019Damia heart leaped at her daringness, but she pressed forward; she lifted up the glass of honey wine. And slowly, slowly, slowly\u2026 she poured the liquor into her breasts.Akkard\u2019s eyes widened by her unexpected actions.He watched the sight of the sticky golden liquid flowing down her white collarbone and disappearing between her rich cleavage that she exposed a little more of beforehand.His gawking was even more blatant than before.\u2018\u2026\u2026is it working?\u2019Damia was not sure. As she waited for Akkard\u2019s reaction, she glanced around to make sure Cecil was not coming back.Cecil was not visible, but to make matters worse, Damia spotted Cesare nearby. He had been watching Dami with a deep look.She hated Cesare\u2019s gaze, which touched her wet chest, so her body hair stood on edge, and getting goosebumps.\u2018No, come on. I can\u2019t fail now.\u2019At this point, there was nowhere to retreat to. Since I had inadvertently captured Cesare\u2019s eyes, I had to seduce Akkard. Otherwise, it would be clear that the quick-witted Cesare would approach and disturb me.Damia clenched her teeth and turned her eyes to Akkard. Fortunately, he still couldn\u2019t take his eyes off her. A thin cloth soaked in honey wine clung to her curves, and it was almost as if Damia\u2019s breasts were shining through it.At that moment, Dami boldly ventured her hand down her honey wine-soaked breast and slowly licked up the liquor on her hand with her red tongue. As if what she was licking wasn\u2019t her finger but something else.\u2018Will you still not come over after this?\u2019Her dark blue eyes glanced straight at Akkard, and smiled slightly. Her shy and seductive eyes lifted a smile from Akkard\u2019s face.Behind his expressionless face, a towering wolf wriggled for a moment. It was as if he was salivating at the flesh of a plump thigh of a deer. With that intense expression, Akkard was looking at Damia like that. Finally, Akkard, who had been throwing intense eyes without blinking, moved his body.\u201c\u2026\u2026wait a moment, please excuse me.\u201dAkkard raised his hand and asked for understanding from the people around him as he passed and divided the circle of people surrounding him.Then he strode past the divided men and came up to her.Within the blink of an eye, the strides of his long legs reached Damia, and he lowered his head to meet her eyes.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dDami held her breath unconsciously. Akkard that came right to her nose, was really, really big! Not only was he tall, but he also had a thick muscular chest and shoulders. He would probably wouldn\u2019t blink an eye at having a woman like Damia on each of his shoulders.Beyond the colorful lights of the banquet hall, she could feel his big shadow all over her.Damia could smell the perfume from his body. The scent, mixed with his hot body odor was very dangerous and sensual.\u2018Am I doing something I shouldn\u2019t have done?\u2019Damia froze. At this moment, she instinctively realized Akkard Valerian wasn\u2019t the kind of person she could handle without any experience.His heated eyes seemed to pierce her breasts covered in wet cloth.Maybe that\u2019s why her nipples stood firmly, on the edge of fear and arousal.She wanted to cover her chest with shame immediately, but on the other hand, an unknown expectation and an uplifting feeling soared, edging her towards audaciousness.It was then. Looking down at Damia, he twisted his lips and whispered,\u201cYou\u2019re wet.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

My ears seemed to melt because of his low, decadent tone.He shook Damia with only one phrase and then took out his handkerchief.\u201cHere, you can use this.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Thank you.\u201dOnly then did Damia come to her senses.According to rumors, Akkard liked to play with sweetly-ripen women. The moment he caught on to her sexual inexperience, this little deviation would undoubtedly come to an end.So Damia smiled unabashedly, as if she was familiar with this sort of situation.She stilled her shaking hands and accepted the handkerchief Akkard had offered and bowed her head.\u201cYou\u2019re very kind. I\u2019m Damia, daughter of Count of Primula. May I know your name?\u201dIt went out more coquettishly than I thought. It was a relief.Of course, there was no way Damia would not have known his name.Akkard was the most recognizable figure in the large and colorful society in the capital.So this remote northern area could be chewed and swallowed by Akkard with ease.Nevertheless, Akkard thought her pretending not to know, asking for a name was cute and charming.One corner of Akkard\u2019s mouth went up in amusement. He was willing to go along with her tricks and match her pace.\u201cI\u2019m Akkard, the second son of a Valerian civil servant and the Royal Knights Commander. It\u2019s a pleasure to meet you.\u201dHis large hand skillfully wrapped around Damia\u2019s hand. He slowly lowered his lips on the back of her sticky hand that still had honey wine on it.Unconsciously, Damia stopped breathing as she looked down on Akkard, bowing and kissing the back of her hand.His lips just touched my hand, but it was hot and tingling as if I had a burn.It was just then. His tongue slid out from between his artfully-shaped lips and licked the back of my hand.\u2018\u2026\u2026!\u2019Where he licked was the very part that Damia had seductively licked before when she was enticing him to approach her. Akkard\u2019s tongue gently swept slowly over it, as if making an indirect kiss.The touch of his hot tongue was unnerving.His beautiful eyes laughed and gleamed provocatively at Damia, and when he met her eyes, she couldn\u2019t help but blush.I finally understood why women, even with full knowledge of his notoriety, still fell for him.Akkard Valerian was so seductive, enticingly wonderful, and beautiful.Rather than keeping her objective in mind, Damia lost her wits, her head entirely blank with a fuzzy whiteness.I could not breathe properly because I was caught by the incredibly terrible color.Damia even forgot to act, reverting to her true self and stared at Akkard with admiring eyes. Akkard also stared into her eyes without blinking, and even though the greeting was over, and it was long past what was seen as acceptable in public, Akkard still held on to Damia\u2019s hand.\u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s too forward to say this even though we\u2019ve only met for the first time.\u201dAkkard\u2019s mouth held a lower voice heavily blurred with his aching desire.\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, my lady, would you accompany me tonight\u2026\u201dIt was finally the moment Dami was looking forward to.\u201c\u2014Wait a moment, please. Lord Akkard!\u201dCesare, who had cut in from the side, intervened with a smile.Because of him, the sense of immersion that existed between the two was shattered.Damia unintentionally sighed deeply.For a moment, I completely forgot the existence of Cesare. That\u2019s why I was so focused on Akkard.\u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201dAkkard was ostensibly displeased with Cesare\u2019s interruption.He glanced at Cesare with an expressionless face. His cold eyes contained a great deal of pressure; there was no doubt he was the Royal Knights Commander.Cesare was also not an easy foe.He opened his mouth with a dismal smile on his face, even when facing Akkard\u2019s burdensome gaze.\u201cI said hello to you earlier, right? This is Damia, my sister, my favorite \u2018family\u2019 member.\u201dThe thin veneer of his words actually meant: get your hands off my Damia right now.A wry smile grace Akkard\u2019s face when he heard Cesare\u2019s words, clearing understanding his connotations.\u201c\u2018Family,\u2019 you say?\u201dHe repeated Cesare\u2019s words mockingly. Then he turned his eyes and looked over Damia blatantly.\u201cThat\u2019s an interesting word.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

We\u2019re not beasts.\u201dSomehow, Akkard, at a glance, had seen through Cesare and into his innermost thoughts.His arrogant, berating words were unrelenting. They were so sharp, hitting his foe\u2019s Achilles heel swiftly\u2014 that even Cesare stiffened at the unexpected attack.Indeed, Akkard wasn\u2019t just a handsome figurehead with some muscle. He was also a smart, influential warrior who dominated the turbulent waves of power it\u2019s shrewd games in the capital.There was no hesitation in his quickness when he trampled on weaker men that interfered in his affairs.Cesare gritted his teeth and glared at his rival. His dark eyes began to turn a chilling blue. The moment she saw it, Damia took courage and dared to intervene.\u201cWait.\u201dThe atmosphere was becoming too overtly antagonistic.Akkard decided his actions on his own, but Damia didn\u2019t want to stay still and be a silent bystander in a situation that was hers to begin with.She was the one who seduced Akkard first, so she felt she should also take responsibility for the situation.Damia quickly realized what to do. She reached out her little trembling hand, clinging to Akkard\u2019s manly arm.And he laughed brightly, raising his chin loftily toward Cesare.\u201cThank you for worrying about me, brother. But I am already a mature woman. So, instead of my brother, I need a gentleman to escort me, don\u2019t I?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. My lady.\u201dAs soon as she came in and wrapped her arms around his, the startled Akkard soon smiled smoothly.For him, even this situation was just an exciting and enjoyable game. And Dami\u2019s response just happened to catch the fancy of the capricious Akkard.\u2018A decent woman should be treated accordingly.\u2019Akkard gently wrapped his hand around Damia\u2019s shoulder and pulled her towards him.He left a provocative farewell to Cesare.\u201cThen, the adults are going to have to leave for private time. It was a pleasure to meet you, heir of Count of Primula. I wish your \u2018family\u2019 well.\u201dCesare lost his composure after Akkard\u2019s sarcastic remarks and the sight of him hugging Damia. He glared at Akkard\u2019s back as they turned and walked away from him.I felt my hair stand on end at that spiteful look.But Damia wasn\u2019t afraid.Even though I was doing such an audacious thing for the first time in my life\u2013 I felt surprisingly good.I was smashing Cesare\u2019s plans that I was so sick of. I felt like I had ripped off the sticky webs of Cesare that had been holding me in prison, slowly strangling me. I felt refreshed.\u201cDamia.\u201dI heard Cesare\u2019s voice calling me from behind.Damia stopped walking inadvertently and soon regretted it.Why didn\u2019t I just pretend I didn\u2019t hear him and left? Ugh, it is my mistake.Not surprisingly, a chillingly soft voice flowed from Cesare\u2019s mouth.\u201cIf Count Primula knew about this, he would be sad. You\u2019re a smart kid, so I\u2019m sure you won\u2019t worry him.\u201dCount Primula, father of Damia. After he lost his wife, he remarried Damia\u2019s current stepmother. For Damia, her only actual family was only one person, her father.Cesare cleverly loomed a subtle threat over her.When she heard this, Dami laughed.Akkard was too formable, smart, and aggressive\u2014plus, he was a big shot Cesare did not dare touch.After realizing this, Cesare evidently tried to play tricks on Damia instead. It was really his way.\u201c\u2026\u2026 Did you say I\u2019m a smart kid? Cesare, brother.\u201dDamia looked back and smiled softly. Cesare frowned at her unexpected response when she didn\u2019t yield to him as usual\u2013 he sensed something was deeply amiss.\u201cI\u2019ve told you so many times. I\u2019m not a child.\u201dDamia, who had stopped talking, squeezed against Akkard\u2019s arm as if to show off. Because of this, her plump breasts covered with sticky liquor rubbed against his forearm. Simultaneously, a subtle excitement was generated from his substantial and stable arm and a previously unknown courage bubbled forth.\u201c\u2026\u2026I am a mature woman, so I don\u2019t need my father\u2019s permission.\u201dFortunately, her father was on a business trip, and by the time he got back, her tryst would have already been done.Choosing to leave with Akkard was somewhat impulsive, but Dami had a reasonable rationale and a clear motivation that would help her see through this reckless decision unscathed.Although Cesare was a formidable opponent, Damia was finally the winner at this moment, and she relished the feeling of victory behind her next words:\u201cThen see you at home later, \u2018brother.'\u201dDamia laughed brightly and then pulled Akkard\u2019s arm proudly next to her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She tilted her neck a little and accepted his lips. She was taking in the sensation of his lips that pressed down on her vital weak point.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dAkkard lips only left her nape when he was satisfied with the red mark he left her.Then he licked his lips and smiled as if provoking Cesare. Damia was deeply impressed because he taunted as if she was so sweet.\u201cNow, let\u2019s go.\u201dAkkard hurriedly wrapped his arms around her waist. Damia happily snuggled against his arm. Disguised as an escort, he stroked her narrow waist with a sensual hand that was hot.Perhaps that is why my body is shivering little by little with the intuition of an approaching giant.The moment I was about to leave the banquet hall, I saw Cecil in the distance. Good timing. She was gawking at me with her mouth wide open alongside my maid. As if she couldn\u2019t believe what she was seeing.\u2018I\u2019m sorry, Cecil.\u2019Damia gave Cecil an apologetic look. Then, before Cecil caught her, she hurriedly walked away.I heard the sound of the banquet hall closing firmly behind my back, and at the same time, I felt relieved and suddenly felt scared. Now I have to spend the night with this man.My mind was dizzy with anxiety and worry.Because of this, her steps were just about to slow down when abruptly, Damia\u2019s body floated upward.\u201cEek!\u201dAkkard suddenly lifted her up. Startled by the unexpected sense of weightlessness, Damia reflexively hugged his neck. Then she felt the shaking of Akkard\u2019s silent laughter through her body that clung onto him.I felt he was teasing me. I was embarrassed by the situation in which I was being held like a child and couldn\u2019t help but pout.Damia timidly protested,\u201cP-please let me down!\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dAkkard replied shortly. His face smiled, and looked down at Damia. Those deep eyes whispered with laughter and a warning at the same time.\u201cNow, it will be harder for you to run away.\u201dDamia, surprised she had been read so thoroughly, momentarily forgot how to speak. Taking advantage of her stunned silence, Akkard strode along with her holding her.In his experience, it was common for women to hesitate or try and play hard to get when they succeeded in seducing a man after they pursued him.I carried her to the carriage and sat with her in front of the door and ordered my coachman:\u201cGo home. As fast as possible.\u201dIt was only then that Damia\u2019s body began to tremble, realizing that she had been firmly captured. A breathtakingly sweet scent arose from her body. Maybe it was the scent of honey wine that had dampened her breasts.Akkard gladly closed his eyes, intoxicated by the aroma. His arms grasped Damia\u2019s body, lifted her above his knees, and settled her on his lap.He kissed her slender neck that seemed to offer itself before his eyes.His lips, which moved slowly between her neck and her collarbone, soon fell on her exposed skin right above her cleavage. Then, he began to lick the thin silk clung tightly over her bewitching breasts.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was new, scary, nerve-wracking, but at the same time, there was a curiosity and an expectation and hope for more of the unknown.\u201cYou\u2019re sweet, Damia.\u201dHe mischievously whispered into her ear. Then he bit the cloth drenched in honey wine and pulled it down.Her nipples that had been stiff for a while due to her aroused state were now fully exposed. The tips, which had been slightly soaked in honey, was glowing with a deep pink color. Akkard took in the sight with delighted eyes and hurriedly bit it.\u201cAh!\u201dHis heated tongue was so feverish it made me dizzy, wrapping around squeezing my nipples, then rolling around the tips and sucking them. Then he gently bit them, so there was no pain and then began licked them again.My body melted as he teased as if he was lapping up delicious chocolate ice cream against his heated tongue. I was so excited that I felt lightheaded.\u201cOhh\u2026..!\u201dDamia was at a loss at what to do and half out of her mind when with clumsy movements, she wrapped her arms around Akkard\u2019s neck. She hesitated for a moment and then kissed him on his lips. She was hoping to appear as experienced and proficient as possible in this situation.It was a light kiss that touched and dropped slightly.But, it was also Damia\u2019s first kiss.Maybe that\u2019s why I got a little nervous and bumped against front teeth.Struck-Damia, surprised by the touch of teeth, quickly retreated, and she saw Akkard\u2019s breathtakingly handsome face in front of her nose. He looked at Damia with much deeper eyes than before, licking his lips and then biting his lower lip with an amused chuckle.\u201cYou\u2019re bad at being slutty.\u201dHis words made Damia unwillingly glow. Too ashamed to look straight at him, she turned her head. Then he murmured, brushing against Damia\u2019s red ears, with a hoarse voice.\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m getting even more turned on.\u201dAkkard was already feverish. Just as Cecil assumed, Damia was his ideal type. She was an intriguing woman who had a bright appearance with no vulgarity and was a haughty noblewoman but also knew how to provoke a man.But Damia, who boldly seduced him back at the banquet hall, was a very clumsy kisser. It was cute because it had its own surprising taste.Akkard assumed that perhaps northern men were terrible kissers. He thought about it. He came from the capital\u2019s liberal, openly promiscuous higher society. In Akkard\u2019s mind, there was no conjecture that that kiss was Damia\u2019s first.\u2018But it\u2019s true that it\u2019s too clumsy.\u2019Akkard paused for a moment, watching Damia. She was sitting on his lap, gasping for breath, revealing her jiggling breasts\u2014it was an enthralling scene he couldn\u2019t look away from. There was no question that every man would be captivated and mesmerised by her messy appearance.Nevertheless, Akkard was a little different. He had a strong intuition\u2014it wasn\u2019t as strong as his sister, Sienna\u2014but it was an instinctive foreshadowing that had saved him over and over again, and right now, that same feeling gave him a warning as he stared at the woman in front of him.If you carelessly touched that sweet thing, you might one day regret it terribly.\u201c\u2026.. what\u2019s wrong? Sir Akkad?\u201dDamia asked carefully, looking at his countenance. She could intuitively see Akkard\u2019s narrowed eyes.\u201cYou are suspicious of me.\u201dAkkard was famous enough to be gossiped about in the far north. So Damier knew more about him than he imagined.Indeed, he liked women, but he disliked \u2018bothersome\u2019 women. If there was any sign of that, he ruthlessly kicked the woman to the curb without a second glance.Instead, what he especially liked was playful women. These were \u2018convenient\u2019 women who were experienced, dexterous, and sophisticated enough to know how to distinguish between love and pleasure.So, she had to appear to be one of those women too. If it didn\u2019t happen today, they might never get to do this again. Damia was able to gain the upper hand because she caught Cesare off guard by the sudden situation before, but next time he would not be easy to deal with and given enough time, he would interfere.\u2018So you have to do something right now.\u2019It\u2019s easy to act like a playful seductress, but it\u2019s extremely hard to do if you are attempting to do it for the first time like Damia. So she was worried for a moment.Since I had boldly seduced Akkard once, I was worried it would not work twice.It was the moment when she was worrying; she unconsciously changed her posture.Suddenly, under my buttocks, I felt the touch of something hard that pierced me.Damia didn\u2019t know what it was, so she moved her hips curiously. Then, the volume of it rubbed against the softness of her ass expanded even further.Only then did Damia realize.I was sitting down on a half-erect manhood.\u2018\u2026\u2026.!\u2019Damia was genuinely startled and, without thinking, lifted her waist slightly, ready to flee. Just then, by chance, the carriage was caught by a stone and shook. Thanks to that, she involuntarily sank into Akkard\u2019s erection.\u201c\u2026\u2026.Huh!\u201dHer soft, voluptuous ass cheeks squeezed and were firmly pressed against his straight penis. The touch was so magnetic that Akkard groaned low.His handsome brow frowned, and his face turned a feverish red in a flash.The moment Damia saw that colorful expression, she immediately realized what she had to do. She began moving her hips with her arms around Akkard\u2019s neck.Every time her hips swayed left, and right, she slowly rubbed her ass on his penis. Gritting his teeth, finally, Akkard growled a curse:\u201cHoly fuck\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This also increased the rubbing between Akkard\u2019s hard member and the soft feminine body between his legs. He quickly grew feverish.Damia\u2019s cool skin, under his fingertips, was as smooth and moist as silk. Every time he was sucked in between her voluptuous ass cheeks, he felt like he was going to be blown away. This was no different from the titillation of sex.If it feels so good just to be rubbed on top of your clothes, how much more shocking will it taste if you hit it in there? When he thought about it, Akkard felt as if his mouth was watering.\u2018Fuck your suspicions.\u2019I couldn\u2019t take it anymore. At the tip of my nose, her delicate scent struck a violent impulse. An overwhelming passion consumed my mind. It was utterly impossible to relinquish such a lewd body.\u201cDamn.\u201dNow entirely determined to push aside his hesitation and sense of foreboding, Akkard pushed her shoulder down. Damia blinked; suddenly, she was down on the lush seats of the carriage.The sensation of her skirt abruptly poured down on her chest, and belatedly cold air touching her legs came to her. Only then did Damia realize that her skirt had been lifted up. It\u2019s like a scene in a red book depicting the love affairs of a man and a woman and their exciting trysts.Akkard above her stared at her lower body exposed under her skirt with intense eyes. The curves of elastic thighs, slender calves, and tight ankles looked delicious.Akkard\u2019s hunger reached a new height; he slid her legs down, grabbed Damia\u2019s ankles, and spread them wide. With his waist firmly placed between the fascinating culmination between her legs, he skillfully settled down.\u201c\u2026\u2026Sir Akkard?\u201dDamia called his name with a quivering voice because she could feel the straight upright line of his log over her thin underwear. The pillar objected so indignantly that he seemed to threaten to break through the piece of cloth.\u201cWhy, didn\u2019t you want this?\u201dAkkard\u2019s hand reached out to push her hair back behind her ear and smiled. And he coyly grumbled like he was wronged.\u201cYou\u2019re the one who shook your hips on my lap. Asking me to hurry up and put it in.\u201dHer ears burned at his obscene words as she recalled her shameless actions.As soon as Dami blushed, he opened the front of his trousers. In a blink of an eye, his revealed organ rubbed over Damia\u2019s thin and wet underwear. Thinking it was going to pierce her right away, Damia was intimidated.\u201cOh!\u201dFor the first time in my life, I felt the member of a man. It was hard that I couldn\u2019t believe it was flesh.With a piece of cloth between them, it went up and down like a clump over Damia\u2019s vagina. Whenever that happened, his hot tip wandered between her labia and rubbed her flinching clitoris.Damia, on her back, watched the man, his eyes glued shut, enthralled with a primitive sensual teasing. He was groaning low, frowning, and the mere sight of his racy face poked her insides, making her grow stickier and wetter.Damia felt that her legs were getting soaked quickly. She was afraid of venturing out into this unknown world, but she was also so excited.Rattle-The wagon jumped up again. Then, his penis, which had been fluctuating back and forth, caught in a concave of her vaginal mouth and bounced lightly. Because of this, he poked through the entrance as if it would come in right away.\u201cAh!\u201dDamia exclaimed in surprise. She did not know the touch of a thick, hard head before that moment. Fortunately, Akkard interpreted her groan differently and thought she was reluctant to have a relationship in a shaky car.\u201cI\u2019d like to jump in right now, but\u2026\u201dHe mumbled, gently biting her neck: \u201cThere is no need to hurry.\u201d He wasn\u2019t a child, and the night was only just beginning.So Akkard decided to relax a little and enjoy it. He gathered Damia\u2019s breasts, which were exposed above her dress, and sucked them with greed. At the same time, he began rubbing his manhood against Damia and directed her:\u201cTighten your thighs. If you don\u2019t want it to get stuck in here.\u201dDamia did what he told her to do despite her hesitation. From above, he rolled her nipples that were tingling with the tip of his tongue: he sucked in the side and crushed it well. At the same time, from below, his hot, slippery penis rubbed between her petals.The thin underwear was wet with body fluids and sticking to the vagina allowing his tower to go in and out between her legs more smoothly.Damia was now able to distinguish his bulging head rubbing against her narrow gap. Because of the excitement, his hot penis poked obscenely over her swollen clitoris, causing a dull pleasure to grow into a tingling pleasure and gradually spreading until it threatened to paralyze her legs.\u2018Oh, just a little more\u2026\u2026\u2019Damia raised her waist in an impatient mood, not knowing what she wanted. The imminent and tantalizing rush of pleasure ate into her body and made her pant.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I couldn\u2019t bear it because I felt so good both above and below. My toes spontaneously curled, and I was becoming shorter and shorter of breath.I felt I was floating when a sudden white light exploded through my closed eyes as well as the feeling of opening up.\u201cAhhhhaaaa ahhhhhh\u2026!!\u201dMy first orgasm. It was intense. It seemed that my body was trembling uncontrollably, and a thrilling electric current was spreading through my legs.As Damia reached her peak, her sweat made her face flush and glow, her lips parted and quivered, her brow expressed exquisite elation, and her blush reached her watery eyes that rolled back\u2014she was just so erotic looking. Akkard couldn\u2019t take his eyes off her face and ejaculate over her convulsing thighs.\u201cUgh\u2026\u2026\u201dHis semen falling gradually over the white thighs like snow was a truly superb sight.Akkard\u2019s lips were reddened by blood, and his appetite was refreshed. Then, clasping Damia\u2019s hair, he kissed her.Just in time, Akkard was informed of their arrival in front of his mansion. It was very good news. The night just started, and it was promising to be a very long and enjoyable one.***\u201c\u2026I should have done that.\u201dAkkard woke up alone to an empty bedroom. He frowned. After sharing such a hot night with him, she left him in the cold early morning air. Leaving a reminder that she never intended to see him again.This was the first time in his life that Akkard had faced such a situation. He must have done \u2018well\u2019 last night. He even took the junior under his wing and gave her the best experiences and lessons. This was too much.Her face was still clear in his mind\u2019s eye, reaching its peak over and over again, brightly glowing. Under the long eyelashes with beautiful red hair flowing and a winding blush like a flowering sea.When her blue eyes with tears looked up at him as if begging and pleading for him, Akkard had felt so enthralled with a sense of superiority.Akkard had had no doubt that she was crazy him. And why wouldn\u2019t she? He was an outstanding man\u2014Damia\u2019s eyes even shined when she looked at him! Just looking at her eyes, he had felt like he had become the most special man in the world.\u201cThen, why did you leave?\u201dWhat an unbelievable thing! Akkard\u2019s pride as a man was hurt, and his eyes boiled hot.At this moment, he was dying to know what Damia Primula was thinking.Meanwhile, Damia, who got up at the same time, blankly thought:\u2018I\u2019m hungry.\u2019Yesterday, because of vigorous physical exercise, Damia was very hungry. She looked around with heavily lidded eyes. She slept in someone else\u2019s bedroom yesterday, but where she woke up today was not her bedroom, either.Of course, that didn\u2019t mean that Damia became a prodigal in a short time. When she was about to get out of the pink fur quilt, a blanket that was not to her taste, the door to the bedroom bursted open.\u201cGet up, you sleepyhead!\u201dIt was Cecil, the owner of this bedroom. She was bruised without hiding her unpleasant expression.Damia, who owed Cecil, felt a sting of guilt. But she wasn\u2019t afraid of her friend. Contrary to her disgruntled attitude, Cecil held a small tray with morning tea, bread, and scone jam butter in her hand.\u201cI really can\u2019t live because of you, Damia Primula!\u201dCecil had brushed aside the maid and put down the tray she brought exasperatedly, but she took a piece of bread, applied butter by hand, and put it in Damia\u2019s hand.\u201cYou haven\u2019t returned once these two days, so it looks like Cesare is very determined. He left to see Count Primula right away to tell him what you are doing. What the hell are you going to do?\u201dAt that, Damia frowned. She assumed Cesare would not remain still with his temper, as she had lost her virginity before his eyes. But, still, to have followed her father on his business trip to reveal her\u2026Her step brother\u2019s actions had crossed the line. Damia\u2019s eyes sank as she cut the bread.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Of course, My father won\u2019t like it, but what about it? Everyone plays moderately before marriage. He\u2019s not going to interfere with the privacy of his eldest daughter.\u201dDamia answered grimly but calmly. Cecil casually nodded and mumbled, her delicate eyebrows frowning.\u201cWhat the hell does Cesare want? I\u2019m going to chase him down and demand he tells me. I don\u2019t know what he is thinking.\u201d\u201cMaybe he is trying to flatter my father? But he\u2019s already busy with his business. Cesare is probably disturbing him.\u201dDamia frowned. Cesare was her step-brother whom her step-mother brought with her when she remarried. Therefore, even if the current Count of Primula and step-mother were involved, their blood was not mixed at all. It bothered her that he kept hovering around her father.When Damia became serious, Cecil was also lost in thought.\u201cI guess he wants one of the two: Count Primula or you. Which one is it going to be?\u201dDamia didn\u2019t answer. Of course, Cesare couldn\u2019t have both, but she had a sneaking premonition that he might somehow find a way.Dami was rapidly getting tired and closed her eyes. Then Cecil kicked her tongue and poured him a cup of tea.\u201cAs soon as you woke up, I brought up a heavy topic. Just drink it first. Drink it up and talk.\u201d\u2026 Cecil had the knack of offering herbal tea as if it were an alcoholic drink. Damia, who received the glass in a hurry, tilted the cup as she requested.Warming up with fragrant tea water on an empty stomach, her head seemed to clear up a little. It was just when Damia was about to regain inner peace when Cecil couldn\u2019t hold back, who was glancing at her chin from the side and interrogated:\u201cSo did you sleep with Sir Akkard? How was it, as good as the rumors say?\u201d\u201cCoo-hoo! Cough-cough-cough-cough!\u201dDamia spilled and spat up half a cup of tea at the unexpected surprise, wetting the front of the white camise.\u2018It\u2019s like the night I seduced Akkard and poured mead into my chest.\u2019\u201cCecil!\u201dDamia frowned and rebuked the person responsible for surprising her. Cecil, who still had a bone to pick with Damia, refuted sharply:\u201cWhy are you yelling? If you were going to drive me away with a lie, you better be ready to atone for it. Quickly answer me! I\u2019m so curious. Was he not good at it?\u201dCecil eyes were filled with grievances. When she saw that face, Damia had no choice but to resign herself with a groan.\u201cIt was fine.\u201dActually, it was pretty good. Akkard Valerian was really incredible and dashing, and he kept her down until the very end.\u2018Thanks to you, even though it was my first time, I was able to enjoy climaxing until I was utterly exhausted.\u2019Her face turned red when she recalled his appearance last night. Fortunately, Cecil immediately began to complain and inquire about Akkard\u2019s stamina.\u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d get rid of Sir Akkard like that. Dami, I thought you were different, but one night with a playboy\u2026 this sister raised you wrong.\u201d\u201cSorry, Cecil.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to call you Feu Papillon from today. You know what I mean? Fire to the moths!\u201d (TN: it\u2019s actually is fire butterflies\u2014but that didn\u2019t make sense)\u201c\u2026\u2026You must have been very upset. You\u2019re being petty now.\u201dDamia looked at Cecil with tired eyes.I thought I had enough of Cecil, so I kept my mouth shut.She picked up a jam-packed biscuit from the tray and asked Dami.\u201cSo, do you feel refreshed? Or\u2026..do you regret it?\u201d\u201cRegret?\u201dDamia briefly recalled last night. Akkard did not even pretend to be friendly and speak empty words. They had nothing to do with each other, so she didn\u2019t have the audacity to expect consideration.But that meant that everything Akkard did communicate was the truth\u2014and that was sorely lacking in Damia\u2019s world and therefore very refreshing.The truth was in the longing in Akkard\u2019s eyes as he looked at her, the fingertips that stroked her like he was admiring a marvel, and the feverish gestures as if he had been driven into a passionate frenzy and wanted her all to himself. All of those honest actions without pretense spoke volumes to Damia.She was so beautiful that he wanted her.It was a great consolation to Damia, whose self-esteem had fallen to the bottom; even though it was a relationship of momentary affectionless desires, it was true that she was comforted.\u2018Thanks to that, I was able to stand up again because of that shallow warmth.\u2019\u201cI don\u2019t regret sleeping with him, Cecil.\u201d\u201cWell, just in case.\u201dCecil\u2019s pupils shook nervously at Damia\u2019s honest answer. Then she bit her lips before she said:\u201cI\u2019m not really worried about you, Dami, but I\u2019m just speaking out of an older sister\u2019s concern for her younger sister. You know, when grown men and women mix up, things can get complicated\u2026 And since Lord Akkard is charming and handsome, you might develop new feelings\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t like him. It\u2019s just a one-night stand. So you don\u2019t have to worry about me.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Her faith as such was absolutely assured, especially since Akkard attempted to \u201cdraw a line\u201d with her before parting.Cecil heard the conviction in her voice, and she, who had been slightly bent forward, belatedly hummed and snorted.\u201cWho\u2019s worried? I was just curious!\u201d\u201cOkay, thanks anyway.\u201dDamia\u2019s face, smiling with her eyes down, had already matured. Kael, who had been her unrequited love for ten years, left, and her heart had collapsed, but Damia did not show anything. Cecil felt worse.\u201cDamia. If you want, you can stay at my house longer.\u201d\u201cNo. I should go back now.\u201dIt was morning, Damia\u2019s put down her cup of tea, her hair slightly disheveled.\u201cTo the house. \u201cThe adventure is over.Damia had been dumped and rejected by Kael Roysten and slept with an Akkard Valerian in a fit of anger to scratch Cesare\u2019s insides. None of those actions were like Damia.It was a great pleasure to take off the shackles that had bound me with invisible discipline, body manners, and sociality\u2019s morality.It was much more stimulating, hotter, and more enjoyable than I imagined. I had probably made unforgettable memories.However, it was time for the stone to move back to its original position. As Damier Primula, daughter of a Northern nobleman and future heir who will one day succeed Count Primula,***Cesare wasn\u2019t at home, as Cecil said. It was because he went to meet his step-father, Count Primula. Instead, it was a handsome middle-aged woman with orange-scarlet eyes like the sunset who greeted Damia.\u201cYou\u2019re home, Damia.\u201dHolding the little boy in her arms, she looked at Dami with cautious eyes. Being weak and timid, she was always wary of her step-daughter, Damia.\u201cI\u2019m back, Mother. I\u2019ve been at Cecil\u2019s house. I\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t tell you in advance.\u201dHer step-mother, Noella, smiled, reassured at Damia\u2019s self-respecting answer, and laughed as if she was relieved. She asked after her with a face and tone that was more welcoming and warmer than usual.\u201cYou\u2019re late. I put the documents that need approval on your desk. Did you have lunch? You\u2019re not tired?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026no, I\u2019m not particularly hungry, and I\u2019m not tired.\u201d\u201cHahahaha!\u201dAt the same time, Noella\u2019s half-brother Leon burst into laughter, clapped, and reached out to Damia as if pleased. Thanks to him, the awkward atmosphere was shattered.\u201cHi, Leon.\u201dWeak Noella had Leon late in life. She went to see the high priests at the temple every week to pray for her pregnancy.Perhaps thanks to her sincerity, Leon was born as perfect and healthy as possible. Damia, who greeted her younger brother, looked at her step-mother and was ready to retire and take a rest.But Noella looked at Damia, anxious and restless as if she had something she wanted to say.Damia registered her look, puzzled momentarily when a haughty woman\u2019s voice came from behind her.\u201cLady Damia! You\u2019re finally home.\u201d\u2026\u2026Louise Ferria?It was an unexpected guest. Blond-haired, doll-like Louise was a distant relative of Akkard Valerian. Her brother, Lessid, brought Akkard to Kael\u2019s farewell party the day before yesterday.Lessid was a decent young man, but his sister Louise was not.She had an excellent disposition to make people uncomfortable.Just like right now.\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re coming home now! Did you have a good time with my cousin? Because of your frivolous behavior, Cesare even left the mansion.\u201dAs expected, Louise\u2019s first words were attacks. Instead of answering, Damia glanced at Noella. It was clear that the weak step-mother couldn\u2019t stand Louise\u2019s momentum and was somewhat complacent.\u201cBecause of your loose relationships with men, my picnic with Cesare has been canceled. Thank you very much.\u201dLouise raised her chin in a very self-righteous and angry manner. Damia was stunned that Louise was venting her resentment on her.She seemed to like Damia\u2019s step-brother, Cesare, and this new bit of information was too much for her to process, nevermind have to deal with in her current fatigued state. Louise\u2019s mental state might be seriously compromised, more than Damia had originally assumed.\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you talking? Oh, my God, Damia! You didn\u2019t mean to interrupt my picnic with Cesare, did you? Do you really like Cesare?\u201dAgain. She\u2019s doing it again.

Like Damia, her first love was Kael Roysten. If other vital facts were different, perhaps they could have been good friends sharing memories of having the same first unrequited love.But Louise was spoiled, born with a gold spoon in her mouth; she was the famous daughter of Count Ferria and did not know nor what to share her things with others.In her eyes, Damia, who had been close to Kael and his neighbor since childhood, was a thorn in her eyes.So when Kael was 11 years old, Louise stole his favorite collection of exotic glass beads. Taking them as hostages, she demanded that he break his friendship with Damia. Whenever Kael refused, she broke the glass beads one by one in front of him.Kael, a sensitive boy, was shocked by Louise\u2019s brutality. After witnessing the scene, the Marquis came forward and protested to Louise\u2019s parents to take care of their daughter properly. She was forced to stay away from Kael.Since then, Kael who cherished his last remaining glass bead as treasure, gave it to Damia and in exchange took her heart.\u2018But I never thought Louise\u2019s next target would be Cesare.\u2019This was bound to be bad. Louise had always marked Damia as her rival. She even tried to steal her friend Cecil by forcing Cecil to visit her at her mansion.\u2018Of course, Cecil hated it.\u2019Damia\u2019s eyes fell to hide his displeasure. She was used to fending off Louise\u2019s quarrels. She opened her mouth with a painted smile.\u201cI don\u2019t know why you are taking out your anger on me, Miss Louise. I don\u2019t know what you have heard, but it wasn\u2019t because of me that my brother Cesare left the mansion.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not because of you? You\u2019re lying! Then what?\u201dLouise, with her arms crossed, glanced over Damie with a look of blatant distrust. Louise, a non-family member, had no right to demand this kind of thing; she didn\u2019t understand proper boundaries.Thanks to that, Damia became quite irritated. After staying out for two days in a row, she was pretty tired.\u2018I want to go in and take a rest right away, but instead, I have to fight with Lousie because of Cesare?!\u2019\u201cAs you know, we, Count Primula, are in the business of replenishing the supplies necessary for temples. Brother Cesare was just following to see and learn in person from my father. Why is that because of me? I don\u2019t know why you think it is because of me.\u201dOf course, Damia assumed all Louise had was speculation, with that premise in mind, she spoke her lie calmly as if this was true.Louise looked at her with a slightly dubious face. She studied Damia\u2019s elegant eyebrows, her shiny blue eyes, and from her well-shaped lips was a clear and firm voice.Then, even Louise, who hated Damia, was shaken, becoming convinced of her lie.\u201c\u2026\u2026But Cesare was very bad that day. He didn\u2019t make it obvious\u2014 but I can tell! \u2013I\u2019ve always been watching Cesare.\u201dIf you could easily understand him and his subtle cues, then why do you act like someone with tourette\u2019s and ignore everyone else\u2019s signals?Louise, who was worried for a moment, bit her lips. She decided to take her favorite Cesare\u2019s side and began to berate Damia.\u201cHow the hell can Damia walk away with a new man so easily? Was it always like that? Thanks to that, the face of my brother who introduced Sir Akkard fell! I\u2019m ashamed of you as a northern noblewoman.\u201dDamia dumbfounded, so she blankly looked at Louise for a moment.I knew what I did that day was a pretty noticeable act. I knew the truth. Even I was surprised I had managed to leave the party with Akkard, the most famous person in the conservative northern society.But I had no regrets.Damia hoped that Cesare and Kael, who said, \u201cMeet someone else quickly\u201d knew this. And it was even better if other mean-hearted spirits who were ready to pounce on her heard it early and fell away.But when Louise attacked her with a disrespectful tone, she grew irate. She didn\u2019t really like Akkard, but she was strangely proud of herself.\u201cBy the way, Miss Louise.\u201dDamia\u2019s thread of patience had snapped, she laughed a little and asked back in a sweet tone, lowering her lashes.\u201cYou were so envious of me?\u201d\u201c\u2026..I beg your pardon?\u201dLouise frowned as if she heard nonsense and couldn\u2019t comprehend it.However, Damia was the type that became stronger as she got angry. She smiled calmly despite Louise\u2019s glares of contempt.\u201cWhat I did that night\u2014it\u2019s actually what you wanted to do that night\u2014 isn\u2019t it?

Oh my gosh! You should be ashamed. You are really amazing!!\u201dLouise jumped in on the unexpected swipe attack.Her face, seemingly delicate and elegant, was distorted. She looked at Damia with contempt, as if she was a promiscuous woman.Seeing this, Damia laughed. She knew Louise wasn\u2019t without any controversy herself. She recalled the interesting sight her best friend, Cecil, had seen when she was taken to Louise\u2019s mansion forcibly.\u201cI heard all the rumors. Isn\u2019t the new butler in Count Ferria\u2019s mansion is very capable?\u201d\u201cNow, are you looking at other people\u2019s butlers? You really pursue men Miss Damia!\u201dLouise replied with an innocent face, but her eye and eyebrow twitched. She didn\u2019t think Damia knew anything about her private butler working at her family\u2019s mansion.A pleased Damia watched Louise, who was caught off guard.\u201cWell, to be exact, I don\u2019t pursue men; men pursue me.\u201dDamia, who answered leisurely, had a proud expression. This attitude went very well with her voluptuous figure and attractive face.Hatred and jealousy mixed into Louise\u2019s gaze as she stared at her.\u201cActually, I\u2019m not interested in the butlers of the Ferria family. Unlike anyone who suddenly comes in without an invitation to someone else\u2019s mansion, I\u2019m not so idle.\u201cWhy are you talking about it even though you are not interested? Let\u2019s go back to the original topic, instead of talking about other butlers.\u201dLouise clenched her teeth and tried to change the direction of the conversation. It seemed to her that if this topic continued, it would be against her.However, Damie had no intention of letting go of Louise\u2019s weakness. She hated fights, but she never said that she would just take punches because she disliked them. She laughed sweetly at Louise\u2019s efforts, holding her chin.\u201cWas the name probably\u2013 Was it Las? A gorgeous housekeeper with dark hair and watery eyes. That\u2019s funny. I\u2019ve never seen him before, but somehow his description reminds me of someone.\u201dDamia\u2019s red lips flashed a sizzling smile. She smiled as if she knew what Louise was secretly doing with her butler, who looked like Cesare. Louise\u2019s face turned pale after being stabbed with the weakness she had most wanted to hide.\u201cLady Louise.\u201dDamia whispered in a soft voice to her, who couldn\u2019t say a word back.\u201cDon\u2019t think about taking it out on me because my brother won\u2019t deal with you. Don\u2019t push my brother and I together\u2014use disgusting imagination\u2014and if you keep doing that, I might \u201cmake a mistake\u201d and tell him about your cute butler.\u201dLouise glared at Damia as if she wanted to stab her in the eye. Then at one point, Louise\u2019s face brightened as if something had come to mind.\u201c\u2026\u2026I see what you mean. Alright, Lady Damia.\u201dLouise laughed like the man who hid the poisoned dagger in his arms. Naturally, this didn\u2019t work for Damia.Damia thought Louise\u2019s smile, pretending to be harmless, was abominable and waited for her next attack. And her chosen means of attack was unexpected.\u201cInstead, I would be grateful if Miss Damia would not approach my relative, my older brother, anymore.\u201dDamia frowned, confused. Then, she suddenly realized that the \u2018older brother\u2019 Louise was referring to was Akkard Valerian.\u201cAs you know, my relative\u2019s older brother is a person who has had enough trouble with the \u2018pollution\u2019 in the south. But some stupid women from all over the place keep throwing themselves at him, like moths to the fire.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201d\u201cOh, of course, Damia is beautiful. I admit that. But honestly, he was a little bored, right? On that day, my relative brother might have made a mistake because he was drunk, but he\u2019s never going to want to get involved with you again. I\u2019m saying this for your sake. Do you understand what I\u2019m saying?\u201dLouise, who was anxious to hurt Damier, laughed with joy. Damia, looking at her sly face, was about to open her mouth and refute her assumptions.\u201cI\u2019m sorry to interrupt the conversation, but Damia\u2026\u201dSuddenly, Noella, who had stepped out of the fight, returned to her seat with more embarrassing news.\u201cThere\u2019s a visitor outside.

It was obvious what Louise was up to. It was clear that she thought Damia and herself were in similar positions as she had Akkard\u2019s hand.Louise thought that Damia was stirring Cesare just to disturb their relationship. When, in fact, Cesare was simply not interested in Louise, but Louise\u2019s ego could not accept it. It was easier to make Damia into the villainess than her admitting to herself that Cesare was simply not attracted to her.But Louise\u2019s attempt to humiliate and paint Damia as the temptress, unfortunately for her, perfectly backfired at this precise moment. She tried to extract a promise that Damia would \u201cNever be involved with Akkard again\u201d when Akkard visited Damia out of his own volition.\u201cWhat should I do, Dami? Shall I welcome her guest inside?\u201dInquired the meek Noella, not knowing what action to take next. She was already flustered and overwhelmed by the battle of thorny words between her stepdaughter and Lady Louise. She did not know how to deal with conflict, and to make matters worse, she was fretting about the impact of Akkard\u2019s appearance.Of course, Damia felt similarly. Her heart pounded and sank at the announcement that Akkard had arrived. Her whole body, previously heated with outrage, abruptly ran cold.However, she couldn\u2019t be weak in front of Louise. When she parted with Akkard and ended their brief relationship, she didn\u2019t recall bothering him or him being antagonistic, so she didn\u2019t think he was going to be disagreeable. So Damia raised her chin and bluffed.\u201cOh, mother. Of course, you should let him inside. It would be perfect if we all dined together.\u201dDamia laughed sweetly with ease as she took in Lousie\u2019s stiff face, who also didn\u2019t expect Akkard\u2019s visit. Damia took advantage of the opportunity to quickly poke Louise\u2019s pride where it hurt.\u201cMiss Louise must have known beforehand? Isn\u2019t it enough to hand over Lord Akkard\u2019s sentiments yourself? I suppose he wanted to make it clear in person. If he was going to visit, you two are relatives; you could have informed me. Why did Lord Akkard come to my house to see my\u2019 easy to get tired\u2019 face?\u201dLouise, humiliated, gritted her teeth as tears sprung out of her eyes out of irate resentment. But she didn\u2019t open her mouth as she did before. Unlike her recklessly rude behavior from before, she was practicing caution.Just as Damia registered her unusual behavior\u2014a deep, low, and extremely masculine scent grazed the tip of her nose.\u201cDami.\u201dHis lips, as if touching her ears, called her name. It was a sweet call as if he stirred whipping cream in black coffee with his tongue.\u201c\u2026..-Sir Akkard.\u201dDamia looked at him in astonishment. Seeing him again after two days, he still looked dazzling. He wore a suit that fitted well with his sturdy physique, and his straight, bright teeth revealed by a smile was surprisingly handsome.Damia, distracted by his stunning image, was inadvertently self-conscious. It was the first time she had slept with a man, so she was at a loss at how to treat him now that she was face-to-face with him in broad daylight.\u201cThe Countess of Primula. And\u2026 Lady Damia.\u201dLuckily, Akkard knew exactly what to do. Wearing the mask of an immaculate gentleman in front of her stepmother, Noella, he delivered a polite greeting flawlessly.\u201cI apologize for this unannounced visit. I prepared a small gift of apology, so please accept it.\u201dWith not even a moment to refuse, her hands quickly became heavier.It was an exquisite box decorated with gold leaf and small jewels, lightly trimmed and painted in colorful colors. It was the first time Damia saw the artistic refinement of the capital.\u201cI hope you like it.\u201dAkkard smiled and opened the lid of the box. Inside it was filled with a colorful assortment of macaroons that brought pleasure just by sight.Almonds, the main ingredient of macaroons, was usually a snack that couldn\u2019t be eaten in the north because it grew in the south\u2019s warmer regions.Stunned by the charm and alluring cuteness, Damia was momentarily awestruck. Seeing the gap in her senses, Akkard put a bouquet of flowers in her other hand.\u201cOh, and lilacs bloomed in the garden. The scent was so pleasing that I thought of you.\u201dThe smell of fresh and sweet lilacs poured into her arms. With gifts, Akkard effectively sealed both of her hands and pulled in her defenseless self, and kissed Damia on the cheek.\u201cI didn\u2019t forget that you were kind to me at the last banquet. I\u2019m here to repay you for your kindness, so please don\u2019t reject me for being rude.\u201dAkkard\u2019s way with words was very clever. He obviously understood Damia\u2019s intention of \u201cend it with a one-night stand,\u201d but he ignored it and spoke as if he had the right to choose the option of a relationship.Unfortunately, his impudence was perfectly obscured by the capital\u2019s cunning style of socializing. Noella blushed, wholly taken by Akkard\u2019s bold courting. Then, fidgeting, she grabbed little Leon and slipped away.\u201cI-I\u2019ll be away for a moment.

She angrily looked at Damia\u2019s gifts in both of her hands, strangely anxious. Just in time, the corners of Akkard\u2019s mouth, which turned its head and stared at Louise, rose sharply.\u201cLouise Ferria.\u201dUnlike when dealing with Damia, his voice toward his younger brother\u2019s* [*not literally his brother] sibling was cool. As a commander of the royal knights, his call was filled with a sense of overbearing might.\u201cWhat are you doing here at Count Primula\u2019s estate?\u201d\u201cI\u2026.. I have something to say to Ms. Damia\u2026 so I came here.\u201dLouise\u2019s shoulders flinched at his frosty interrogation as she struggled to raise her chin. Their relationship seemed to be one of subordinate to superior rather than her brother\u2019s friend and distant relative.Seeing this, Damia thought,\u2018I guess the two aren\u2019t close.\u2019Louise has just spoken for him as if she was close to Akkard, but the reality was different from what she said. The sense of distance between them was apparent.\u201cWhat did you want to say? What is it? I\u2019ve never heard of you being acquainted with Miss Dami.\u201dAfter hearing Louise\u2019s answer, Akkard raised one eyebrow and asked again. Damia was puzzled by his attitude.Louise was his distant relative\u2019s younger sister. However, Akkard\u2019s behavior towards her was as if she was his debtor, and he was a threatening loan shark pressing for payment. The mood was so terrifying that Louise, who had a bad temper, couldn\u2019t even speak.\u2018What a strange relationship.\u2019Damia decided to remember this feeling of disparity.\u201cWhy are you intervening between Miss Damia and me? You are too much, Lord Akkard!\u201dLouise, who couldn\u2019t stand it, protested, his voice trembling with resentment.Damia hated Louise, but she had to agree. He had no right to question Louise. He was the same in that he visited without prior notice.The atmosphere around them quickly froze. Akkard was smiling, but his eyes looking at Louise was sharp like a blade.\u201cListen, Louise, the length of time I can stay in the north is short. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t want to waste my time with troublesome buzzing flies that keep disturbing my friendships.\u201dUnlike the acrimonious warning, his voice was creepily soft. He, who shut Louise\u2019s mouth, turned to Damia and smiled with his purple eyes.As she took a step back and watched the icy battle, Damia was instantly flustered. His deep purple eyes seemed to be peeling her clothes off with his eyes.Akkard laughed satisfactorily, having briefly monopolized Damia\u2019s gaze. Regardless of his reputation, he was still a man who could captivate anyone.Every time Damia\u2014who seemed arrogant, provocative, and calm\u2014 looked at him as if enchanted, Akkard became excited as if he was drunk. Her innocent and ecstatic eyes made the man\u2019s blood boil hot.Louise, who was left out amidst the exchange of bewitching glances between Damia and Akkard, bit her lip. Her shoulders shook with angry chagrin. Akkard opened his mouth with a sharp voice,\u201cIt looks like you didn\u2019t understand my words.\u201dTaking his gaze away from Damia, Akkard\u2019s eyes quickly became severe. Akkard took a step towards Louise, bowed his head, and spoke spitefully at her twisted face.\u201cGet out. Right now.\u201dLouise\u2019s face, which was insulted openly in front of Damia, turned red. Most gentlemen were careful in front of Louise, but instead, Akkard mocked and verbally abused her.\u2018\u2026\u2026you have a terrible personality.\u2019Damia looked at Akkard\u2019s side profile with weary eyes. The temperament of a man as beautiful as an angel was worse than that of the devil. But even this seemed attractive because of his striking good looks.\u201cOh\u2014you\u2019re so mean!!\u201dLousie huffed, knocked down her chair, turned away, stomping and ran off with a slammed door. She went wild when she arrived and somehow managed to do even more when she left.Akkard, who was the final winner, snickered as if showing off his viciousness, took the bouquet from Damia\u2019s hand, and put it on the table without care.Her now empty hand instantly became full again as sunburnt, hard, copper-colored hands intertwined with hers like branches. His big, muscular, good-looking fingers came in, spreading the gap between her slender fingers. And then they snuck in as if she was wearing tight grips like a trap\u201cHi.\u201dNow that there were only the two of them, alone, he revealed his true colors and whispered with a sexy languid smile.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Can\u2019t I visit without business to attend to? We had such a hot night.\u201dAkkard\u2019s tone became much denser and thicker as her eyes fell on him. Damia\u2019s cheeks flared up at words that brought up their past tryst. Akkard, looking at her reaction with joyful eyes, reached out and stroked her face.\u201cThat day, I went easy. Most are afraid the first time. If I knew you would get away that day, I wouldn\u2019t have gone so easy on you. You didn\u2019t get fucked properly. I should have hit it until I tore apart your legs.\u201dDamia was dumbfounded and speechless. The words he said while lowering his white lashes and looking at her with deep eyes were perfectly vulgar.Nevertheless, his face was so handsome and his delivery so confident that she couldn\u2019t feel disgusted by him.\u201cIt\u2019s just the two of us here right now, so let\u2019s be honest.\u201dA frowning Akkard squeezed and rung out the cravat on his neck, which was quickly released by his rough hand movements. The front of his shirt widened while the wind gave Damia a glimpse of his hollow collarbone and well-trained chest muscles.\u201cIt was definitely your first time that day. Wasn\u2019t it?\u201dHis eyes were wild as a beast, and the question came out like a bolt of lightning striking the topic she most wanted to avoid.\u201cWhy did you do that?\u201dAkkard\u2019s question has a lot of meaning. No matter how sexually free young men and women were these days, everyone still regarded the first time as special.He wanted to know why Damia threw her precious first time at a player like himself. Without knowing that he got caught up in her first experience, he felt he deserved to know why.Damia\u2019s face clouded after being grilled by the man with whom she spent the night with.\u201c\u2026\u2026Why are you curious about that?\u201dShe backed away, embarrassed while avoiding Akkard\u2019s gaze, but he stepped forward, closing the distance between them.\u201cI\u2019m so curious\u2014I\u2019m going crazy, so tell me.\u201dHis big hand held her chin firmly.\u201cWhy did you spread your legs to me when it was your first time.\u201dThe heavy voice squeezed coldly into my ears. His attitude told me that he felt as if I treated him as if he was a prostitute that I had approached for some purpose.Without being aware of it, I shivered. The man\u2019s face in front of me was smiling but was icy. Only then I realized that I couldn\u2019t get out of this situation without answering.\u2018This is so awkward.\u2019Damia lowered her eyelashes to hide her embarrassment. And to alleviate the sharp atmosphere, she replied with a voice that sounded weak.\u201c\u2026\u2026. what\u2019s so important about the first time?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dAkkard doubted his ears heard her answer right. Of course the first experience was important to women\u2014it was only natural. So wouldn\u2019t they be making high-minded threats to the man to give them everything in return for giving him their first time?Akkard has seen so many women clinging to him, but it was the first time in his life that he heard a woman say such a thing.Akkard paused at the new shock. Taking advantage of his silence, Damia continued to speak in a quiet but clear voice:\u201cYou know, Lord Akkard is a famous person, so when I heard he was coming to the North, I really wanted to see him. And actually Sir Akkard\u2026 was more wonderful than I thoughtDamia, paused, and smiled shyly at him. Her eyes were glistening with rapture as if she were looking upon the most beautiful thing in the world. That moment Damia glanced at Akkard, revealing her eyes, and confessed sweetly.\u201cSo I don\u2019t regret last night. No, I\u2019m rather grateful, because thanks to Sir Akkard, my first experience will remain a wonderful memory.\u201dShe is making me crazy.\u2026\u2026 I\u2019m going crazy.This woman must know what to say to men to make them go crazy.Being a confident male, I felt that my pride was a little assuaged.Oh, of course\u2013 until she continued.\u201cSo that\u2019s enough for me.

It seemed that she had better find a reason to kick Akkard out of the house as soon as possible, so she hurriedly tried to divert his attention.\u201cWell, I heard\u2026..I heard that Sir Akkard had work to do in the North. His Majesty, the Crown Prince, personally sent Sir Akkard here, didn\u2019t he?

He was doing \u2018work\u2019 in his own way. Additionally, it would be very satisfying if he could punish an impure woman who has no experience trying to flee from him.\u2018I am going to thoroughly tame that innocent body so that it only knows me.\u2019And if and when I get tired of you then\u2026Akkard smiled coldly, imagining a joyful future. As a seasoned hunter, he knew how to steer his fleeing prey. Akkard, who concealed his cruel intentions and laughed, walked away.\u201cAre you snubbing people like that and now worrying about my affairs?\u201dHer intention was clear, but his large physique wasn\u2019t a joke when he moved a little. As his hard chest came closer, a surprised Damia backed away.Akkard was able to easily drive her to her corner without any effort. He slowly bowed his back, placing his hand against the wall, and lowered his eyes. And whispered, looking down at Damia who was caught between his arms.\u201cI got you.\u201dDamia froze like a mouse under a cat\u2019s foot. She looked up at him, trying not to show her nerves.\u201cWhy are you doing this to me?\u201dAkkard grabbed her hand that pushed against his shoulder and slowly clasped her hand in his. The touch of the slender fingers trembling in his hand was very sweet.Damia Primula strangely stimulated his sadism. While he wanted to melt her with so much tenderness and kindness, he also wanted to hold her violently until he made her cry.Akkard struggled with conflicting impulses like a tempting snake, but he managed to exercise patience and chose the former. With her white wrist exposed to him at an angle, he kissed her delicate palm and whispered, his lips tenderly vibrating against her skin.\u201cThat\u2019s because you left me that night.\u201dThe lips that touched her sensitive palm were really hot. The moist and smooth lips stuck softly every time he spoke, stimulating all of Dami\u2019s senses.Damia was greatly shaken. The sexy aura of the man in front of her was so intense, so thick that she couldn\u2019t breathe. While her head was dizzy, she was confident in the full understanding of his nickname:\u2018Ahal Teke of the capital, indeed.\u2019There was a legend that Ahal Teke was the most beautiful stallion in the world.Its hair sparkled brilliantly under the sun with pale gold and platinum tone. Not only was it superior to other stallions in physical strength, but also much bigger.Damia looked up at the man in front of her. A man\u2019s\u2014 much larger than herself\u2014 hair was shining in a fascinating silver-white color in the afternoon sun. Its subtle color was as beautiful as a pale rainbow hung in a dewy web.It was very difficult to reject such a fine man. However, Damia managed to do it with pure willpower.\u201cAbandoning? We didn\u2019t have any relationship in the first place. It was just one night.\u201dAkkard asked, laughing, his bad personality revealed.\u201cOne night? With whose permission?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was a real injustice. If she had clung to him, it was obvious that Akkard would have drawn the line first by declaring: \u2018We have nothing to do with each other.\u2019Akkard Valerian was such a man. So many women wept over him and tried to snag him somehow\u2014he who could not be caught. It would be extraordinary if she had what others couldn\u2019t get.Unfortunately, Damia was not such a woman. With an animal-like sense, Akkard noticed this, so he slyly decided to act like the victim.\u201cWhen did you say it was a one-night stand? Even so, I don\u2019t remember agreeing to such a thing. It takes two to tango\u2014and now you are finishing up unilaterally? You\u2019re so irresponsible.\u201dDamia\u2019s cheeks blushed at the uselessly naked plea. She was not a fool, so she knew well that Akkard was being stubborn.Even now, his beautiful eyes were smiling coldly. It was clear that he was by no means sincere.However, it was embarrassing for a man who seemed unlikely to do so, to hang onto her like this.Dami, who was only interested in his appearance but had a weakness for dating, was bright.Akkard didn\u2019t miss the gap. He didn\u2019t want to give Damia time to regain her reason. She was so clever that he didn\u2019t shake her by surprise there was no hope.\u201cTell me, Dami. Why do we have to end with only one night? Was I so terrible that night?\u201d\u201cWhat on earth are you talking about? That day, I\u2026\u201d\u201cYeah, you only wrapped in a sheet under me that day until the sheets were gone. I gave you a break when you said you couldn\u2019t go anymore, right? You moaned and screamed about how it was so good, so why are you saying something different now?\u201dDamia opened her mouth in utter astonishment that he could say such things out loud.After seeing this, Akkard was sure how to embarrass her. However, if he pushed further, she would definitely protest. He sensed that it was time to pull gently.\u201cDami.\u201dHe rubbed his cheek against Damia\u2019s small palm and looked up at her under his white eyelashes. And he smiled very sweetly. Like a hunter who drives a little fox into a trap.\u201cWe were good, together\u2014 Don\u2019t you think so? You might deny it. But I don\u2019t want to. The night I spent with you was very speacial and enjoyable.\u201dDamia lowered her eyes without a word. Apart from the beating of the heart, her head was rational. At first glance, he seemed to think Damia was a special person. However, he meant that \u2018night\u2019 I spent with you was special, not \u2018you.\u2019A man who only wanted pleasure instead of love kissed her palm. Then he tilted his head and asked cruelly.\u201cBut why do I have to finish such a good thing and do it only once? I don\u2019t understand.\u201dHis seductive attitude toward Damia expressed brazen confidence. There was no fear of being rejected reflected in his steady, intense gaze and grin.Dami looked up at the handsome face without a word. The sweet, dark skin, sharp features, purple eyes, and sensual lips were shockingly beautiful. A better man than this would be hard to find even if she searched the entire kingdom.So Damia knew that once she gave her heart to him, his beauty would become a deadly blade and be stuck in her heart.\u201cBecause I\u2026 I don\u2019t want you.\u201dreplied Dami, who smiled half-heartedly. The unexpected answer wiped the smile off Akkard\u2019s face. After seeing this, Damia shook her head and explained:\u201cSir Akkard, you\u2019re like fire. You are a good partner to burn the night away. But it\u2019s too dangerous to get closer for longer than that because there will definitely be irreversible burns.Her voice was as sweet as the spring breeze. But the meaning contained in it was clear. Akkard stared at the face of the woman who refused him and laughed quietly.\u201cHa.\u201dAkkard knew she was not a woman who pretended not to like men to lead them now. It was obvious by her speech and behavior.So Damia\u2019s refusal is probably sincere. However, her red cheeks and shining eyes that looked at him as if he was wonderful were also sincere.Akkard clenched his teeth and managed to smile. He said it lightly anyway. It\u2019s just that he had experience seducing others, so he was able to talk to her and be more convincing.So even if Dami rejected him, he didn\u2019t think it would be a big blow. But it was. He couldn\u2019t understand why she rejected him with such a heated look.\u2018Why the hell are you pushing me away? You\u2019re attracted to me!\u2019At that moment, he grabbed her shoulders and shook her, with an intense urge to ask why. His bloody hands trembled to curb strong violence. Taking advantage of the shake, Damia, who crawled out of his hands, stepped back and turned away.\u201cThank you, Sir Akkard, for visiting. Please return home carefully.\u201dAkkard looked at Damia\u2019s retreating back, unbelieving.Akkard, with a wicked gaze, followed her with his eyes until she completely disappeared from sight. Damia never looked back.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Louise Ferria visited your home? Is she crazy?\u201dCecil, who put down the fork he was holding, was stunned. Unlike Dami, she didn\u2019t have abundant unpleasant sentiments for Louise\u2014that is until Louise\u2019s morbid stalking attempt to steal her, Dami\u2019s best friend, away from Damia.Louise was the type who didn\u2019t know how to get along with others. Before she gave up on pursuing Cecil, Cecil recalled having to be subjected to extreme torture. Cecil\u2019s voice, which recalled the trauma at that time, rose sharply.\u201cI really can\u2019t understand what\u2019s in her head!!\u201d\u201cWho understands Louise Ferria? My family couldn\u2019t either.\u201dDamia, who gave up on everything, answered back listlessly. However, Cecil, who had already suffered from stress disorder in the past, showed no signs of calming down easily.\u201cDamia did I tell you about the butler of the Ferria family before? He looks just like your step brother!\u201d\u201cYes, I remember. His name was Lars\u2026.\u201dDamia nodded her head. Thanks to that information, she was lucky to get a good shot at Louise. But Cecil\u2019s ideas seemed a little different.\u201cI actually got goosebumps when I saw the butler. Think about what she usually says and does! She hides a hot butler in his house and makes him act like Cesare. Treating him like a substitute for a human being\u2014 It\u2019s gross!!\u201dCecil, who recalled the shock and fear of that time, heated up. As her voice continued to rise, Damia could feel the surrounding people\u2019s gaze being drawn to them.\u201cCecil.\u201dDamia gave a quiet hint.They were now at an outdoor tea party hosted by Cecil\u2019s mother.Therefore, besides the table where they sat, many guests walked around them in the afternoon garden.\u2018If you get caught up in Louise\u2019s scandals in a place like this, you\u2019ll be pretty tired of the future.\u2019 Realizing this, Cecil remained silent. But her silence did not last very long. It was because there were still more surprises left.\u201c\u2026Wha-what?\u201dAt Damia\u2019s next piece of news, Cecil made a choking noise. She couldn\u2019t bring herself to speak and barely asked back:\u201cAkkard Valerian came to your house\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhat the hell? You said it was over!\u201d\u201cWell, he doesn\u2019t seem to think so.\u201dDamia responded gloomily. The pensive side of her face was as pure as a flower. After seeing this, Cecil clicked her tongue and thought inside:\u2018Well, that kind of beauty would be rare even in the capital.\u2019No matter how narrow the northern part of the country is, Damia was one of the world\u2019s most beautiful people. Therefore, no matter how much of a player Akkard Valerian is, he can\u2019t let go.Cecil frowned at the situation as she had been worried: I\u2019ve been begging you not to get involved with Akkard. I mean, you didn\u2019t even listen to me!Seeing Cecil\u2019s face clearly revealed her disapproval, Damia hurriedly clarified:\u201cBut it\u2019s really over now! I told him clearly when he came.\u201d\u201c\u2026Really?\u201dDami grinned at Cecil\u2019s disbelieving attitude. Cecil could see Damia didn\u2019t even consider the possibility that Akkard was serious. When Cecil lowered her eyelashes, Dami gently persuaded her friend.\u201cSir Akkard has a lot of pride, Cecil. Once rejected, he won\u2019t approach me again.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cThink about it. Lord Akkard is a man who has nothing to be desired in the first place. Why would you be obsessed with a northern country bumpkin like me? Don\u2019t you think so?\u201d\u201cWell, I don\u2019t think so.\u201dCecil, who narrowed her eyes, replied in doubt.By now, Dami was a little frustrated. She was about to wrinkle her nose and ask what was wrong with her.Cecil just pointed.\u201cBecause it\u2019s there. Can you see?

He was really there. Akkard Valerian.He had just arrived, surveying the garden with an uninterested look. His bluish-gray robes brought out his silver hair made his large and magnificent physique stand out.As he studied his surroundings\u2014for a brief moment, his and Damia\u2019s unsuspecting gaze met. Stunned, she felt as if she was stabbed with a broad needle. They shared a short but intense stare.Damia choked and looked away, crouching away unconsciously. The tension was overwhelming, and Akkard soon, too, turned his eyes away. It was only afterwards that Damia realized she had held her breath.No regrets or feelings were read from the side of his sculptural face.\u201cHmm.\u201dSeeing this, Cecil made a very suspicious sound. Her face clearly was wondering whether or not he was over his feelings. Seeing a chance to comfort and convince her friend, Damia spoke:\u201cSee, I told you already. It\u2019s over.\u201d\u2026\u2026Really? Cecil glanced at Akkard. Whenever she saw him, he exuded an incredible sensuous aura. The fact that it was apparent that he knew it made him even more annoying and that much more attractive.Well, would a man like that ever get hung up on a woman? It would be improbable. Concluding as such, Cecil sighed and looked back on Akkard when something caught both Cecil\u2019s and Akkard\u2019s gaze.\u201cEh?\u201d\u201cHmm? What\u2019s wrong, Cecil?\u201d\u201cLook over there, Damia\u2014it\u2019s Lessid Ferria.\u201dDamia turned to a name she hadn\u2019t heard in a long time. There stood a man with long blond hair, just as elegant as an elf. He was quietly talking to Akkard, as if conscious of the attention they drew.\u201cThey must have come together.\u201d\u201cAre they that close?\u201d\u201cProbably. Do you remember Kael\u2019s farewell party? It was Lessid who brought Akkard and introduced him to northern society that day.\u201d\u201cAh, I see.\u201d\u201cMaybe you didn\u2019t notice. Lessid introduced him and went straight back to the temple. Maybe he had a lot of work to do because of problems in the South?\u201d\u201cThat makes sense.\u201dDamia casually agreed and nodded absentmindedly, recalling that day. Cecil had said that that day that Louise\u2019s brother had brought Akkard.Lessid Ferira. He was the second son of Count Ferira. However, unlike his grandiose grandmother, he was quite sensitive and harsh. Considering that he was a priest belonging to the temple, his temper was very impressive.\u201cLessid is here, so Louise won\u2019t be here today. That\u2019s fortunate.\u201dCecil was deeply relieved as she dramatically held her hand to her heart.No one knew why but Lessid and Louise loathed each other. Even the loud words they exchanged in public were too harsh. It seemed rather unbelievable that they were siblings born from the same parents.Wasn\u2019t there a saying that your enemy\u2019s enemy was your friend? Perhaps that\u2019s why Lessid was very gentle toward Damia. Just like now.\u201cLady Damia! Oh, Lady Cecil is with you.Lessid, who spotted her, greeted her in a friendly manner.\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time. How have you been?\u201dLessid was smiling brightly. He had always stayed at the temple and when he entered society again and societized his was always pleasant\u2014except when the conversation concerned his sister.\u201cI heard that Louise had a tantrum again. When I raised and spoiled her as my youngest sibling, I never thought she would grow up to be so unruly. I am embarrassed to face you as her brother. I\u2019m sorry.\u201dLessid lowered his eyes and apologized in his sister\u2019s stead. His expression was so acrimonious that Damia, stunned by his unexpected apology, hurried to comfort him. Dami couldn\u2019t bear to speak ill of a sister in front of her brother, smiled gently.\u201cI\u2019m fine. Don\u2019t worry. Recently, haven\u2019t you been busy cleaning up the \u2018pollution\u2019 in the South? Thank you for your efforts and hard work.\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s awful. I hope this pollution incident ends soon.\u201dLessid replied with a solemn expression. \u2018Contamination\u2019 or \u2018pollution\u2019 was the biggest problem facing the kingdom nowOne day the land soured, and the crops could not grow. Severe diseases infested the bodies of people and livestock who touched the soil.Not only that, but strange beasts appeared around contaminated land, hurting the innocent. Fortunately, \u2018pollution\u2019 could be purified by divine power, so priests were kept busy at unprecedented levels.\u201cBy the way, Dami are you ill? You don\u2019t look well.\u201dDamia feigned a smile and waved her hand at Lessid\u2019s concern.\u201cI\u2019m fine, don\u2019t worry.\u201d\u201cAre you sure? You\u2019re so pale.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 that\u2019s\u2014\u201dAlthough Dami was smiling, she was crying inside. Her cracked expression wasn\u2019t because of Louise, but rather because of Lessid.Well, to be precise, because of the man standing next to himWith a fierce look in his eyes, Akkard watched Lessid\u2019s useless friendly banter.\u201cAh.

Sociable Lessid was trying to acquaint Damia and Akkard!Lessid left Kael\u2019s farewell party early, so he never saw the sight of Damia and Akkard leaving the ballroom together. Believing that it was the first time meeting each other, he opened his mouth:\u201cLet me introduce you. This is my friend from the capital. Lord Akkard, son of the Duke of Valerian.\u201dDamia, who was being introduced to someone she had already had sex with, literally wanted to die. It was only yesterday that Akkard had visited her home, and she had rejected him.Akkard\u2019s gaze, looking down at her from above her head, was more stinging than the summer heat. Damia couldn\u2019t even make eye contact. In the middle of his expressionless face, only his eyes were shining very brightly.\u201c\u2026\u2026.Sir Akkard? What\u2019s wrong?\u201dLessid frowned in his eyes with a strange face after Damia managed to mumble a greeting, and Akkard stayed silent. However, Akkard\u2019s sculptural mouth was tightly closed, and there was no sign of it opening.\u2018Oh if the world could end now\u2014!\u2019Damia prayed for the end of the world, inwardly. And, of course, the world did not perish. Instead, the hand of salvation was extended from an unexpected place.\u201cAh\u2026 Suddenly\u2014I feel dizzy\u2026.\u201dSuddenly, Cecil, who held her forehead, wavered and swayed. Damia reflexively grabbed and supported her friend\u2019s body. Hugging Cecil, she glimpsed Cecil\u2019s lips fluttering into a small smile that only Damia noticed.R.U.N.Damia was deeply moved when she realized what her tearful friend meant. She quickly shook Cecil in distress.\u201cCecil, are you okay? Wake up!\u201d\u201cI guess I\u2019ve been getting too much sun\u2026 quickly inside\u2026\u201dCecil entered into a performance of the soul, the acting engulfing her entire body as she trembled and pointed towards the building. Damia nodded in an effort to manage her facial expressions. She would naturally support Cecil, and they could leave together.But there was one thing they overlooked. It was the fact that Sir Lessid in front of him was a priest.\u201cPlease move aside. Lady Damia and I will carry Miss Cecil and heal her.\u201d\u201c\u2026.What? No, no. Just take a little rest inside\u2026 ..\u201d\u201cDivine power should be used in this case. Don\u2019t worry.\u201dLessid, who responded with a firm, clear tone, supported Cecil and escorted her inside the mansion. Thanks to Lessid\u2019s needless professional spirit, Damia was left behind. With Akkard Valerian.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThere was a weighty silence. It was so heavy that the weight of the mines operated by Cecil\u2019s house seemed to be lighter than this.Damia carefully peered up at Akkard under her long lashes. It wasn\u2019t her way to keep her mouth shut and look on like a sinner.Akkard could have left, but seeing that he stayed, it was clear that he had something to say. Damia, desperately grasping at her courage, opened her mouth softly.\u201cI didn\u2019t know I was going to see you here. Do you like tea parties?\u201d\u201cNot even a little.\u201dHis short and firm answer stifled her, and Damia completely lost her will to talk to him.\u201cAh. Yes. Then I\u2019ll go\u2026\u201dDamia lowered her eyes, planning her escape. Just as she was about to run away, Akkard blocked her retreat with only one step, with one corner of his mouth rising. It was a bitter smile that somehow made the viewer feel ominous.\u201cBut it was still worth it to come here. I witnessed an amusing sight.\u201d\u201cAn amusing sight?\u201d\u201cI was entertained by your friend\u2019s skit. Your acting skills are terrible.\u201dAt that, Damia bit her lips. She assumed Akkard would notice, but she didn\u2019t expect that he would explicitly point it out. Damia replied in a quiet tone, repressing her turbulent feelings.\u201cCecil is my dear friend. I won\u2019t stand for it if you mock her\u2014even if it\u2019s you, Lord Akkard.\u201d\u201cYou won\u2019t stand for it? What are you going to do?\u201dHe grinned and gazed at Damia\u2019s clutched hand with interest. They were thin and soft hands, delicate like a tree branch.You must have never held anything heavier than a teacup.Even if you hit me with your utmost strength, it still wouldn\u2019t hurt.Even with their heated tempers his sister Sienna never struck him nor did they even exchange blows even as children. However, at this moment, it occurred to him that Akkard wouldn\u2019t mind taking a beating from Dami so that her heart would be in debt to him.\u2018I\u2019ll get my hands on you somehow.\u2019And after playing with her, I\u2019ll make her into a joke and cast her aside.Akkard laughed deeply inside.He grabbed Damia\u2019s fragile wrist and brought it to his cheek.\u201cTell me. What can you do? Are you going to hit me with these pretty hands, umm?\u201dWith his handsome face, he asked devilishly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Her fingers on his cheek fluttered in surprise. The sensation of her fingers brushing the fluffy hairs on his skin was quite ticklish. While being distracted by the unfamiliar sense, Damia\u2019s voice flew into his ears.\u201c\u2026\u2026 I don\u2019t hit people.\u201d\u201cThen?\u201d\u201cI could never speak to someone who speaks ill of my friend.\u201dIt was as soft and cold as silk curtains hanging by an open window in the middle of winter. Damia\u2019s firm tone silenced the laughter brimming on Akkard\u2019s lips. He thought for a moment with steel eyes.\u2018This woman doesn\u2019t really care or want to get along with you.\u2019A woman would dare not put the end of a relationship in her mouth if she had any hopes for him\u2014even if it was just a little.Both Damia and Akkard instinctively sensed each other\u2019s coldness.Damia knew she must turn away Akkard without hesitation.Despite what others assumed about Damia because she was a gorgeous beauty\u2014she was highly intelligent. She was aware of the fact that a hasty rejection would not work for him.Nevertheless, those pretty lips already hinted at the \u2018end\u2019\u2014for the third time, no less. It meant that Damia was absolutely sincere.Squeeze-His molars were gritted against each other with force. When he was rejected for the first time, he was dumbfounded \u2014angry for the second time. And the third time, he felt as if he was going crazy.I can\u2019t understand this woman in front of me.\u2018How come?\u2019Akkard was not humble even if he sprouted empty words of modesty in the face of acclaim.He had accomplished too many things and was too smart.He knew he was one of the best men with exceptionally superior looks with excellent status and conditions.He couldn\u2019t help but know his worth. Wherever he went, eyes of anticipation and the sweet redness of blushing women\u2014and even sometimes men\u2014followed him and made Akkard aware of his value and desirability every second.They were so excited at my appearance that sometimes I was tired of their intense emotions and that I could not help but get used to the hands that clung on to me, wanting to get involved with me.But all of those things meant nothing in front of this woman. Akkard couldn\u2019t understand this bizarre predicament at all.He opened his mouth impulsively.\u201cWhat the hell\u2014why?\u201d\u201cEh? What? Umm, by the way, my hand\u2026\u201dHer hand was still touching Akkard\u2019s sculptural face.The light heartbeat felt under her palm, and the man\u2019s unique hot body temperature made her feel awkward.Embarrassed, Damia pulled her hand away, but Akkard held onto her even more tightly, persistently.\u201cWhy are you rejecting me?\u201dAt the aggressive question, Dami\u2019s lips were half-open\u2014speechless.Someone would have thought he was insane; however, the person who asked this ridiculous question was serious.\u201cYou don\u2019t have a fiance or a lover, right?\u201dHis confidence was as strong and as tall as a mountain. Damia couldn\u2019t help but laugh at his logic \u2018a woman without a lover must like me\u2019 she could have been outraged, but Akkard was so brazen that she laughed first.The man in front of her was indeed a man of sensual appearance. But it was indeed bizarre. Suddenly this big man looked like a little boy who was too forceful.\u201cSir Akkard.\u201dWith a smile on her lips, Damia addressed him. His sharp eyes met hers. His purple eyes were reminiscent of a cat-like beast were peering at her, confused as to why she was laughing.Dami moved her hand and swept his cheek gently as if to appease him. And she revealed her position as gently as possible.\u201cYou\u2019re the most attractive man I\u2019ve ever seen. I won\u2019t deny that. But you\u2019re not the one I want.\u201d\u201cWho is the person you want?\u201d\u201cA person who is the opposite of you.\u201dDamia answered; her voice was somewhat pained.Kael\u2019s face appeared in her mind\u2019s eye. He was an easy-to-understand and friendly person. He was a far cry from those trying to tame and use people through manipulation or trying to plant anxiety to fulfill personal vanity.That\u2019s why I liked Kael Roysten. The more I spent time with him, the more I hoped we could be together in the future, not just as friends, but as lovers.But he chose a different future.He left Damia and entered into the arms of the temple and the saint. And Dami\u2019s heart was left with a scar of a long unrequited love. She hadn\u2019t healed yet, so it prevented her from falling into a new love.That was the only reason she didn\u2019t fall for Akkard.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Akkard was speechless for a moment.\u201cWhat the hell, you\u2019re a woman\u2026\u2026.\u201dAkkard opened his mouth without knowing what he wanted to ask or say. But before that mystery could be solved, someone intervened.It was Lessid who stood in front of Akkard, which deterred him.\u201cLady Damia.\u201dLessid, with a smooth, elegant movement, chinned towards the mansion as he glided between them. He reported the progress in a flat deep tone.\u201cMiss Cecil is resting inside. She just got a little hot, so she\u2019ll be fine soon.\u201c\u2026 Thank you.\u201dDami, who knew better than anyone that Cecil was a fake patient, smiled awkwardly.Now that Lessid was back, there was no need for her to continue to converse with Akkard.She secretly hid her released hand behind her back and decided to run away from her spot.\u201cThen I\u2019ll go see Cecil. It was nice to meet you today. Sir Akkard and Father Lessid.\u201dThe tight-lipped Akkard didn\u2019t respond. Instead, Lessid uttered the appropriate good-bye:\u201cMay the Goddess always be with you.\u201dDamia, who was lightly addressed, moved away. Maybe because she was a beauty, even her back and figure was uselessly perfect.Her hair was like petals flying in the wind, showing off her feminine body line in her fluffy skirt.\u201cYou are going to stare a hole in the back of her head.\u201dLessid pointed out in a harsh, angry tone. In response, Akkard stuck back fiercely, his thick eyebrows frowning.\u201cThen why don\u2019t you put your eyes away.\u201dLessid didn\u2019t answer back. Instead, he clicked his tongue and whispered, lowering his voice.\u201cEven if you can\u2019t control your wandering eyes, don\u2019t forget what you need to do.\u201dAkkard\u2019s face turned cold as the talk of work came out.That\u2019s right.Akkard Valerian suddenly came to the far north because there was a secret \u2018mission\u2019 to do here.Lessid\u2019s words pinpointed this fact. He subtly reiterated himself to the unresponsive Akkard.\u201cEven if I am presumptuous, please understand. I even chose this side, betraying the temple. So I don\u2019t want things to go wrong because of personal feelings.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I know well.\u201dAkkard answered slowly. His voice was as hard and cold as iron. After hearing his clear answer, Lessid\u2019s severe expression was lifted a little.\u201cOkay, let\u2019s concentrate together and do our job well, for the poor South suffering from \u2018pollution.'\u201d\u201cIndeed.\u201dAkkard nodded. There was a short tight bond between the two men united by the same goal.Until Lessid opened his mouth again:\u201cOh! And don\u2019t get too close to Lady Damia.\u201d\u201cWhy? You think I\u2019ll be blinded by a woman and mess up the mission?\u201dAkkard asked back, infuriated. No matter how much they were on the same side, there was now an insurmountable wall between Lessid and himself. Lessid had crossed a line.Akkard was a top predator in name and substance. He had never let anything crawl under his feet. A completely unexpected reply came out of Lessid as Akkard gritted his teeth and waited for his answer.\u201cNo, because I like Damia.\u201d\u201c\u2026.. What?\u201d\u201cWhat are you so surprised about? She\u2019s so pretty and smart. It would be weird if you didn\u2019t like her.\u201dLessid, who answered calmly, looked at him with a rather sour, strange look. He seemed to have no idea that Akkard had already slept with her.As a result, Akkard, lost in the absurdity of the situation, remained silent for a while. Taking advantage of the gap of silence, Lessid added in a quick tone:\u201cI\u2019m telling you beforehand, don\u2019t touch Miss Damia. As soon as this is done, I\u2019m going to take off my new uniform and confess immediately.\u201dLessid, who recited the cliche lines from popular romance novels, quickly walked away.Akkard watched the swaying blonde, bewildered.\u201c\u2026But I\u2019ve already touched her first.\u201dAkkard\u2019s stomach was boiling.No matter how bad his reputation was in the capital\u2019s society, it was very unfair to him this time.He was a victim of Damia\u2019s relationship with him. Dami seduced him by tricking him like a worn-out, broken woman from the very beginning. And after using him for her first experience, she ran away\u2014as if it weren\u2019t her who seduced him in the first place!This situation alone was driving him crazy\u2014 but now even Lessid was afraid of being discarded like a single, lonely dog by Damia.An angry Akkad lashed out with a small curse,\u201cDamn it.\u201dIt was clear that he did not fit well with Northern soil\u2014goddamn it all.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She searched the mansion until it was familiar to her. If she went outside anyway, Damia would have to face Akkard again and\u2026\u2018He\u2019s\u2026 uncomfortable.\u2019Akkard and herself had very different personalities. It was challenging to explain the fact coherently and convince him. In particular, if he intended to persuade her, the conversation would have been even more awkward.Akkard was such a desirable man that her eyes were dazzled, and her blood would get hot just by looking at him. She didn\u2019t mind when such an excellent specimen of a man showed interest in her. But\u2026\u2018He\u2019ll soon lose interest, and I\u2019ll be thrown away.\u2019Dami laughed in a self-deprecating manner. She was an honest, sincere, and foolish woman who held one to a one-sided love for ten years. And men never liked women like her.What they liked was a woman who was the opposite of her. A fox-like woman proud, sly, and witty\u2014refuses to be caught and burns a man\u2019s heart.Men were willing to give their hearts to such a woman knowing that she would handle their hearts carelessly, toss it, roll it and then discard it when they\u2019re sick of it.Of course, if you judged by pure appearance, Damia was the great fire fox from afar. But when you got to know her, you would realize she was a foolish bear in relationships.I didn\u2019t think of myself as stupid. I was confident in my abilities to manage the internal affairs of the family with ease. When I heard something unpleasant, I knew how to respond with restraint but also stand up for myself, and I was sure in my capacity that I could solve any problem that came my way.But love was a completely separate matter.\u2018I can tell by looking at Kael.\u2019I wanted to be nice to him because I love him. I was willing to do what I could for him, without keeping score or doubting anything. Every moment of love for him was full of warmth, so Damia could not be petty or picky.And again and again, men didn\u2019t like such women. Of course, there was nothing more to say about Akkard Valerian, who is experienced in dating. And as soon as he gets to know Damia better, he\u2019ll run away in a daze of boredom.\u2018It would be a serious mistake.\u2019Dami shook her head and smiled in a self-effacing manner. Half-expecting Cecil to pop up and tell her to stop berating herself. But there was no sign of her friend anywhere in the mansion.\u2018Maybe she\u2019s in the backyard?\u2019Tea parties were usually held in the mansion\u2019s central garden or in the front yard, and Cecil wasn\u2019t a big fan of the crowded areas. Therefore, it was highly likely that she went to the quiet backyard to avoid the guests.Damia turned to the rear door. The corridor leading to the shaded back of the mansion was isolated. Even the employees were barely around.As she got closer to the foyer, she heard a loud voice. Dami listened to the voice of an elegant woman in the wind. It was quite similar to Cecil\u2019s usual tone.\u2018Cecil?\u2019Just as Damia was trying to get closer, the conversation entered Damia\u2019s ears as the distance narrowed.\u201cHow do you\u2026 So, did you\u2026 did it?\u201dThis stopped Damia\u2019s footsteps. Now she could tell. It was not a friend\u2019s voice. Or rather, it was closer to the voice of the enemy.\u2018Louise Ferria.\u2019As soon as Damia recognized the owner of the voice, her mood dampened. She didn\u2019t expect Louise would also come to this tea party. Especially considering that her brother, Lessid, had arrived first.Damia frowned. As she surmised before, Louise was so self-centered and emotional that she didn\u2019t care when and where she was. It would not be in Damia\u2019s favor to face someone without limits in such a remote place as it is now.Deciding to turn around, the words of an unidentified man talking to Louise flew into Damia\u2019s ears.\u201cThere\u2019s still\u2026 a little problem. Cesare is now in Daeshin.\u201dDid you just say Cesare?Damia, who was about to leave, paused. The name of her step-brother, who she had forgotten for a moment, captured her ankle from moving forward.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What\u2019s he up to?\u2019I knew Cesare followed my father\u2019s business trip. But there seemed to be a separate plot. And Louise, an avid follower of Cesare, seemed to know what it was.Instinctively Damia knew this information was quite significant, so she stilled her feet.But the next moment, she regretted her decision.\u201cNo, wait a minute before we talk.\u201d\u201cWhat are you trying to do\u2026\u201d\u201cTwit! Do you know this isn\u2019t your house? Maybe we should check to see who\u2019s around.\u201dEkk! Damia\u2019s heart sank and pounded with a numb dread. Louise\u2019s footsteps echoed louder as she approached Damia\u2019s hiding spot, and if Louise stuck her head in the doorway and checked the hallway, she would see her.Holding her breath, Damia walked back and forth silently, looking for a place to hide. But there wasn\u2019t much to conceal in a long corridor. She couldn\u2019t even risk fleeing to the nearest room to hide in time unless surely they would hear the sound of her running.\u2018What should I do?\u2019Louise\u2019s long shadow was growing inside the entrance. Damia took a deep breath with tension.\u201c\u2026\u2026..!!\u201dTwo massive, strong arms stretched out from behind her, covering her mouth and pulling her. Damia was dragged by the arm without any resistance. Her vision seemed to be dimming, and the smell of the dusty velvet hit her nose.\u2018What\u2026!!\u2019Startled, Damia twisted her body. The person who hugged her from behind gave strength to the large arms encircling her and suppressed her movements. Damia was surprised by how utterly immobile she became.A low whisper reached her ear.\u201cShh.\u201dThe breath leaking from those lips filled her ears with heat. It was a familiar voice with a familiar warmth. Only then did Damia notice the subtle scent of perfume mixed with the man\u2019s body temperature. This scent was very masculine and heavy and felt just like\u2026.\u2018Sir Akkard?\u2019Damia, who stopped struggling without realizing it, looked back. Akkard pressed his index finger over his sensual lips, making a gesture to be quiet.Only then was Damia was reminded of Louise\u2019s presence. Louise\u2019s profile appeared through a skinny gap.Step, Step-Damia stopped breathing. Akkard probably dragged her in the back passage that servants have set up to collect cleaning tools or run errands.Luckily, Louise didn\u2019t pay much attention to the shabby locker. The thoroughly aristocratic woman seemed to think that no one could hide in such a dirty place. Especially if they were nobles or anyone she needed to bother with.\u201cHuh.\u201dLouise looked around the corridor and took a quick turn. After confirming that no one was there, she was about to go back outside to the man. But before that, the man outside strode inside.\u201cWhy are you coming in again?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s hot because of the sun. Why don\u2019t we talk in the hallway? I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s here.\u201dThe young man answered irritably, taking off his shirt. At the words, Louise retorted in a sharp tone.\u201cWhat if someone comes?\u201d\u201cAt least it\u2019s better than the open outside. It\u2019s a straight hallway, so it\u2019s easy to spot a rat hiding, right?\u201dLouise was silent for a moment pondering his reasonable logic. During her deliberation, Damia\u2019s ears pricked up while in the locker. She was afraid that she might miss an important topic.\u201cOkay, but keep your voice down.\u201dSure enough, Louise whispered, reducing her voice. Damia couldn\u2019t hear anything afterwards.The two were a little far from the locker Damia was hiding in, and Damia\u2019s stomach and ears started to burn. To find a better vantage point to eavesdrop on their conversation, she leaned forward heavily. Forgetting that there are other people in this locker beside herself.\u201c\u2026 \u2026Damia.\u201dAkkard frowned and barely whispered. His voice was a lot more thicker and strained than before. But Damia, who focused on the conversation in front of her, didn\u2019t notice it.\u201cShh.\u201dDamia, who didn\u2019t look back, waved her hand and signaled not to interrupt. And to place her ear closer to the small door opening, she bent her back even deeper.Fortunately, her efforts paid off. She thought she could make out words. Damia was all set to listen to Louise\u2019s conversation with bated breath.It was just then. She felt a strange phenomenon behind her ass.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Damia was puzzled and twisted her ass a little. It was unfamiliar, but it was a strange feeling \u2013she had experienced such a sensation at least once before.Confused as to what was against her, Damia moved her buttocks once again to figure out the identity of this feeling. In desperation, arms stretched out from behind her, grabbed her waist tightly, and growled small.\u201cStay still, Damia.\u201dThe nervous voice held tones of urgency. The moment she heard it, Damia realized \u2014What was touching her ass.\u201c\u2026\u2026!!\u201dInstantly, Damia\u2019s cheeks grew hot, and she stiffened her body awkwardly without knowing what to do. The man\u2019s large body was against her back, and the masculine forearms wrapped around the waist were of particular concern.It was that moment. Louise Ferira opened the door.\u201cIt\u2019s a big deal. Cesare has to come back from Daeshin as soon as possible.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t help it. He\u2019s going to get the \u2018stuff\u2019. It\u2019ll be hard to come back until I get it.\u201dStuff? Damia narrowed her eyes. She knew that Cesare was in Daeshin now.\u2018But I thought you went to tell my father.\u2019However, listening to Louise\u2019s words, Cesare seemed to have gone to get something. He was a human being who could not always be vigilant.Damia held her breath, and she continued to listen to them. Fortunately, they didn\u2019t realize people were hiding in the locker. Akkard, who was also interested in conversation, and did not disturb Damia anymore. This made it easier to listen to the discussion.\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult. You have to get Cecil Evergreen as soon as possible, but to do that, Cesare has to return.\u201dThe next moment, her friend\u2019s name popped out of Louise\u2019s mouth. Damia couldn\u2019t understand why Cecil was mentioned here. Then the man kicked her tongue just in time and blamed Lousie.\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll get along with her. I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s so hard to get acquainted with each other.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s easier said than done! Cecil is that foxy girl\u2019s friend! Surely she must have said something to Cecil.\u201dLouise bit her thumbnails and gritted her teeth. Damia smiled, knowing what she was talking about.She was right that Cecil hated Louise. But that wasn\u2019t the fault of Damia. Louise pursued Cecil too tenaciously and tried to get her to do what she wanted. Cecil was exposed to her neurosis.\u2018But I thought it was because Cecil was my friend.\u2019When Louise was a child, she had been trying to take her Kael away from her, so Damia thought it was the same for Cecil. But now that she heard this conversation\u2026 it seemed Louise approached Cecil with some other intention in mind\u2014rather than pettiness.\u201cAnyway, now I have no choice but to wait for Cesare while looking at the trends.\u201d\u201cWait until the goods come from the temple?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Once you feed Cecil Evergreen\u2026 then it\u2019s over.\u201dLouise\u2019s fierce voice showed a triumphant look, and Damia, who was listening to her, bit her lips. She was fearful that something terrible would happen to her dear friend.Then the man across from her Louise suddenly opened his mouth.\u201cWhy do you look forward to it so much? Is it because you like obeying Cesare?\u201d\u201cSo? Is there another reason?\u201d\u201cI think there is.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about, huh?\u201dA dark shadow came to Louise\u2019s voice. Her temper was hard to deal with, but the man was a bit different, so he casually scratched a sore spot.\u201cYou don\u2019t know? Don\u2019t you know Sister Damia?\u201dDamier opened her eyes wide at her name flowing out of his mouth.\u2018Who is it?\u2019Is there anyone who could call her sister? An only daughter, Damia, was puzzled. She stuck closer to the door and looked at the face of the man talking to Louise. And she soon found out who he was.\u2018Klaus Hari?\u2019Klaus, the only son of Count Harry, had a unique and subtle appearance, mixed with blood from the West and East continents because his mother was from the East.Damia\u2019s father ran several businesses, including items that were delivered on Klaus\u2019s mother\u2019s behalf. And one of them was the tea leaf business with Count Harry.Because of this, he sometimes followed his father to Count Harry\u2019s. Damia and Klaus, who had no siblings, quickly became friends, so they had a pretty good relationship until puberty came. Maybe it would be nice to call him a childhood friend.\u2018Although it is all in the past.\u2019Adolescence, like measles, transformed heterosexual relationships into a different form than before. Klaus gradually began to distance himself from her, and after a few years, they even ceased to talk to each other.It was a pity. But Damia didn\u2019t really care. At the time, she was too overwhelmed and aware of her first love, Kael.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He had been a delicate, sensitive boy when he was young. When she saw that he became a big young man, he seemed like a new person.\u2018I heard about your close friends with Cesare, but I never thought I\u2019d see you here.\u2019But now wasn\u2019t the time to be immersed in the sentiments of the past. At Klaus\u2019 sudden words, Louise seemed firmly offended.\u201cWhy do I hate Damia Primula? It has nothing to do with you.\u201dKlaus laughed at Louise\u2019s sharp-tongued attitude.\u201cAh. It\u2019s obvious; you can\u2019t hide your feelings. It looks fun to take a friend from Nuna* Damia?\u201d [*Older sister]\u201cWhy? Now come on. You feel sorry for her?\u201d\u201cWell, a little bit.\u201dKlaus confirmed in a neat tone. Louise screamed at his reply.\u201cWhy the hell do men only like that girl? What is it that I lack or less than when it comes to Damia Primula?\u201d\u201cMaybe you have nothing here?\u201dKlaus squeezed his chest and chuckled. Damia was unfamiliar with the expression of mischievousness.Louise\u2019s doll-like face, who witnessed this movement, turned red at once. Still, her complex and sense of inferiority was raised as she raised her hand.\u201cKlaus, how you dare to make fun of me\u2026\u2026!!\u201d\u201cOops\u2026\u201dKlaus, whose age was active in physical activity, avoided her hand without difficulty. However, he couldn\u2019t escape her kicking under her generous skirt.\u201cOww!!\u201dKlaus was kicked in the shin with her pointed shoes. He frowned, and his eyes as he glared at Louise became fierce. He seemed to say he would stand being hit once for a joke\u2014but wouldn\u2019t stand for it if he was hit anymore.Seeing this, Louise gritted her teeth in anger and forced her foot down. She was on the same boat with him, whether she liked it or not. If she created more resentment between them, nothing good would come from it.\u201cStop joking around and focus on what\u2019s in front of you! Do you understand?\u201dLouise snapped at him and turned away. She was trembling with anger and walking away as if she didn\u2019t want to be in the same space as Klaus.\u201cYes, yes, yes. When you contact Cesare, don\u2019t forget to tell them! Don\u2019t \u2018blink\u2019 again.\u201dOf course, there was no answer back. Klaus rubbed his bruising shin, looking in the direction of Louise\u2019s disappearance.\u201cWhat a temper.\u201dKlaus clicked his tongue in distaste and finally left. Damia held her breath and waited for his footsteps to disappear completely over the corridor.\u201c\u2026..\u201dIt seemed like everyone was really gone. Damia sighed and relaxed her body. After being very nervous for a long time, she was very tired.She was about to push open the door to the locker when a large hand popped out over her shoulder, grabbing her delicate wrist.Damia was so surprised that her heart fluttered. Her body trembled when she realized that she had completely forgotten the man behind her back.\u201cOh, Lord Akkard?\u201dDamia carefully looked back at him. It wasn\u2019t what he intended, but the movement was close to one of a ferocious beast\u2019s.It was unavoidable. Akkard dimly reflected in the lighter shade of the door from the dark shadows exuded a dangerous feeling. Especially his sharp eyes shining brightly under thick eyebrows.\u201cDo not go out yet.\u201dHe whispered briefly to Damia, dissuading her. Damia was puzzled. The sound of sweeping came from somewhere.\u201cIt\u2019s a maid.\u201dDamia felt embarrassed. It certainly seemed a little difficult to go out now. The maid was sweeping through a hallway with no one else and would be surprised if someone suddenly jumped out of the locker.\u2018Two of them, too.\u2019Especially if she were caught hiding with Akkard, there would be strange rumors. Damia reluctantly took her hand away from the door. And was surprised and stiffened when she tried to move back in a startled manner.\u2018Ah, again\u2026\u2019She felt it. Something of her was stabbing her fiercely behind her ass. It was hot and hard, as if it was going to break through her clothes right now.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As soon as he saw this, his groin was sorely energized.\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to get caught, stay still.\u2019Akkard, who had his teeth clenched tightly, whispered and tried to catch his breath. He could see Damia\u2019s blushing as his breath heated up by desire touched her ears. As if made of porcelain, the white and delicate earbuds were colored with reddish-pink at the end.As soon as he saw this, Akkard literally turned his eyes.\u2018I can\u2019t stand it anymore.\u2019He\u2019s been patient for a long time. It wasn\u2019t intentional, but he was holding Damia from behind.Her summer tea party dress was thin and light. Beyond the silk-like soft cloth, Damia\u2019s plump and soft ass cheeks were clearly felt. Just a touch would make any man gasp, go hard and stick out like a horny dog in heat.On top of that, she also had rich hair and a good scent coming off her white neck. That alone would kill dozens, and Damia Primula even leaned forward in this situation.So her ass naturally pressed down against him. It was sloppy and gently rubbed against him and fueling the man\u2019s desire.Therefore, it was all Damia\u2019s fault that he was in heat now.\u2018So you have to take responsibility.\u2019With his eyes dimly shining, Akkard hugged her slender body tightly from behind. Then he reached out and began to squeeze her voluptuous breasts over her clothes.\u201c\u2026\u2026Sir Akkard!\u201dSurprised, Damia called him with a suffocating sound and tried to take his hand off. But Akkard ignored her voice and put his teeth on her neck.\u201cAh!\u201d\u201cShhh. If you keep making loud noises, they might open the locker.. .\u201dHe warned, biting her long, white neck like a deer. And grumpily, he began to caress her chest more earnestly.An unimaginable big breast filled the palm of his hand, giving him a proud fullness. As he swept a couple of fingertips over her peaks, he could feel her nipples standing sharply under the thin dress.\u201cThey\u2019re standing, aren\u2019t they?\u201dWhen he intentionally spit it out to shame, he could see her neck turning redder in front of him. She was so cute as she struggled to hold back her voice. So Akkard opened the front of the dress and touched her breasts directly.Her body trembled as he pinched her trembling nipples and spun it round and round. In addition to this, with her shivering ear in his mouth, a sweet moan flowed out.\u201c\u2026\u2026unghn!\u201dTears welled up in Damia\u2019s eyes. The teasing and stroking of her breasts was too provocative, and the tongue teasing that penetrated into her ear. Even when she tried to avoid it, he did not budge as if his arms were made of iron.The tongue, which was coming and going in and out of the ears, touched her round ears and sucked the tender flesh behind her ear, and then bit it. The sensation that originated in a small place less than half a span of the palm swallowed and shook her whole body.It was the moment when Damia trembled endlessly at the unfamiliarity. A hand that was squeezing her breast went down to her navel and dug through the hem of her skirt.\u201cN-no\u2026\u201dDamia rushed to close her thighs. However, as if to laugh at her efforts, his large hand crept through the gap.With his calloused hand, his big rough fingertips gently touched her delicate entrance. As Akkard\u2019s hot fingers pressed slowly and softly against her puffy and slightly thick vaginal mouth, her obscene honey oozed out and flowed down from the inside.\u201cIt\u2019s getting wet.\u201dAkkard groaned as if he was reprimanding her, but he played with her with his hands. At her sensitive vaginal mouth, he spread her soft labia like petals with two fingers, and his middle finger caressed her and then crushed the top of her clitoris. In reaction, hot honey poured out from the inside of her entrance again.Damia looked back at him, gasping almost crying. There was a person outside the locker, and she looked like she didn\u2019t know how to do this. Her face, which was so overwhelmed with pleasure that she didn\u2019t know what to do, further aroused the man\u2019s sadism.\u201cHow foolish.\u201dThat kind of facial expression is counterproductive. He kissed Dama\u2019s temple and whispered with a horrible affection.Unlike his slow dark voice, his behavior became more urgent and harsh. After roughly lowering his pants, he grabbed Damia\u2019s soft ass and started rubbing his pillar on her tiny, white underwear revealed under her lifted skirt.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This is what I\u2019m doing.\u201dAkkard pulled her wet underwear with his fingers and slid his cock through a small gap. His hot, thick penis moved in the underwear as if they would come through the entrance right away.Surprised by the sensation, Damie quaked. When she forgot the situation for a moment and tried to struggle, Akkard, who was holding her arm, whispered:\u201cShh, if you move like that, it could go in by mistake.\u201dOf course, it was a lie. He would like to go all the way, but he needed space to poke and ride around all night long with his robust stamina.But doing this with Damia was to release some frustration. Akkard wanted to make her cry and torment the woman who kept running away from him.Damia became calm when Akkard threatened to put it in. Her eyes looking up at him in anxiety were so sweet that he wanted to lick them. Feeling the desire that soared to the end of her neck, Akkard grabbed her waist harder and held her hips close.\u201cOkay, just stay still.\u201dPutting his own between her two silky smooth thighs, he slowly pushed his back. His penis, soaked with transparent liquid, stroked her labia lips without difficulty.Akkard began to move back and forth, enjoying the pleasure of that tight kiss between her lower lips. It wasn\u2019t as good as putting it in, but it had its own taste.\u2018I\u2019m so excited.\u2019He lowered his gaze under his light eyelashes. There, Damia, whose ears were red, was being held by him while one of her hands covered his mouth, trembling. Even though she was afraid that a sound would leak, she was more embarrassed by her burning body.Her tearful appearance was pitiful. At the same time, the male\u2019s heart was set on fire even more. Akkard wanted to keep bothering her and see her crying from uncontrollable pleasure again and again.\u201cDamia.\u201dHer thighs trembled as he sang her name in a husky voice. Akkard slowly and deliberately stroked her flat lower abdomen.\u201cYes, yes\u2026\u201dWhen he touched her opening covered with honey, Damia shook her head as if not to. Even now, she was out of her mind because of his penis, which teased her\u2014coming in and out from the back, as if it would penetrate her at any moment. In this situation, if Akkard bullied her front too, she would collapse, and there was no guarantee that she could hold back her voice.Akkard ignored the pathetic resistance and slipped his hand through an opening. It was easy to find the clitoris located there.He slowly rubbed the red, slightly swollen pearl with a deep appetite. Then, Damie\u2019s gasping breathing immediately made her feel sweet.\u201cHuh, yeah\u2026 Ah\u2026.\u201d\u201cAre you that happy? It\u2019s so swollen here.\u201dWhenever he teased his fingers faster, a wet sound echoed through his ears, and the lewd sound echoed in the narrow locker as well. Every time the place that was as small as a baby\u2019s fingernail was tormented, Damia couldn\u2019t come to her senses because of the pleasure that made her legs go numb.The movement of his sex organ, poking and rubbing on her vaginal mouth, was mesmerizing. Behind her, his firm lower abdomen smacked her soft butt and pushed harder.His penis that stroked between her thighs was hot and sore. But whenever he came near to coming in, she tightened her core without realizing it. It wasn\u2019t even inserted, but she got the illusion that his organ was digging inside her vagina.Damia was helplessly caught by him and couldn\u2019t even moan and shed tears. When her ass was pulled back, his penis rubbed against her even harder and when he was pushed forward, his fingers taunted her clitoris mercilessly.Damia\u2019s legs were so weak that she couldn\u2019t stand properly. In order not to fall, Damia took her hand off her mouth and held herself against the door of the locker. She was worried that her moans would leak belatedly.\u201cOut there, uh\u2026 they\u2019ll hear me\u2026\u2026.\u201dFinally, Damia cried and clung on to him. Akkard reached out and covered her mouth, feeling the mounting excitement that seemed to culminate at any moment. Then, with his fingers, he teased her moist mouth.\u201cHow does your cheap water taste?\u201dShe knew what it was even if Akkard didn\u2019t mention it. The slightly sour, sweet, bland and extremely lewd fluid that melted on her tongue.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His harsh breathing behind her was exciting and frightening. The body-shaking stimulation made her into a female in heat, not Damia Primula.Afraid of the sensation, Damie sobbed. One day this man suddenly appeared in the North, shaking her whole routine and common sense. Like a storm, he blew everything away and swung her around, holding her all the way.She hated it but also was delighted and going crazy with excitement. His fingers that played around her skirt made her ecstatic, as if the heat of a violent man stabbing from behind would melt her away.\u201cIt\u2019s hot. You\u2019re going to melt my cock in your stream of water.\u201d\u201cNo, stop\u2014Ugh!\u201dAt some point, her pussy contractions became stronger until Akkard attacked her clit, and her eyes rolled back and turned white with mind-numbing pleasure.\u201cAhhh\u2026!\u201dHer toes curled up, and her thighs trembled. The peachy ass cheeks revealed in the dark squeezed, her muscles clamping. Because of this, the round part leading to the thigh was cut like a dimple.Akkard touched that dimple and whispered with a mischievous smile.\u201cDid you cum already? You\u2019re really sexy.\u201dIn the meantime, he steadily shook his waist, pretending to be relaxed, but Akkard\u2019s eyes flushed red with lust with great excitement at the fantastic view in front of him.And he had no choice but to hold himself back in this titillating situation. Someone was outside as they hid in a dark locker as he stroked his cock between the thighs of a stunning beauty. Especially the superb view of Damia, who was afraid of being caught, so she couldn\u2019t even make a sound properly, and the magnificent sight of her twisting her body endlessly in pleasure.\u201cNo, we\u2019ll get caught. That\u2019s enough\u2026\u201cIf you want to stop, tighten your thighs and shake your hips more.\u201dAkkard licked his red lips with carnal desire and smacked her ass lightly. Damia was surprised and tightened her thighs further. Then, Akkard\u2019s groans, as murky as boiling iron water, resonated.\u201cYes, that\u2019s it. More. tighten more.\u201dA small jolt in the enclosed locker filled with the sound of a man\u2019s rough gasping and the obscene sound of his genitals rubbing between her wet legs. Akkard\u2019s body, which was heated by heightened pleasure, was as hot as a black rock heated by the scorching sun in the middle of summer.Damia shook wildly without hesitation. There wasn\u2019t penetration but somehow, it was more chaotic and obscene than sexual intercourse.Her pussy, still high off of her climax, which had yet to subside, was still twitching freely. Akkard\u2019s cock still rubbed against her and her now overly sensitive body trembled and convulsed.Maybe that\u2019s why even though she was so careful, a convulsion made her bump her shoulder or knee somewhere on the locker door. The sound leaked outside, and the maid stopped brushing with her broomstick.\u201c\u2026\u2026? Is anyone there?\u201dThe maid\u2019s footsteps were approaching them. Frightened by this, Damia stretched her arm back and tried to push Akkard away. But he grabbed her arm and pulled it back, and rubbed his penis more vigorously.\u201cHnughh.\u201dHe burst a small groan through his teeth and pushed his waist forward. Damia\u2019s body hit by the momentum hit the locker door loudly.Boom-boom! Rattle-!\u201cOh, my!\u201dThe maid, who was approaching, screamed in surprise. Upon hearing this, Damia sobbed and grabbed the locker door, afraid that the maid would open the locker door immediately.In the meantime, Akkard was calm. After a few more rough moves, he squeezed between Damia\u2019s thighs to the root of his member and ejaculated.\u201cOh\u2026..!!\u201dShe could feel his firm body trembling close behind her back. At the same time, Damia\u2019s overworked thighs suddenly became damp.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dThe sound of his breath soaked in pleasure was drowsy, but it was a mess for Damia, who was underneath the greedy male.

This was the problem with outdoor sex. His time to relax and enjoy his afterglow was always interrupted; he immediately revealed his original temper.\u201cMove your hands.\u201dHolding Damia\u2019s shaky hand, he took it away from the locker. Then he clenched his fist and hit the wall of the locker hard.Boom! Bang-!He didn\u2019t even seem to want to hide the fact that there were people in the locker. Although it was a deafening sound, his strong fist was intact.\u201cGet out of here!\u201dAkkard, revealing his discomfort, immediately threatened those outside. The servant girl, who knew nothing, was literally stunned and terrified by his aggressive reaction.\u201cAhhhhh!\u201dAlthough she worked in a noble family for a long time, this was the first time something like this happened. Shocked and frightened, the maid turned around and ran away.The sound of the maid\u2019s footsteps echoed loudly in the hallway, slowly fading away. When the traces of her body disappeared completely, the relieved Damia\u2019s body could finally relax.\u201cAh\u2026.\u201dShe had moved so energetically in a small place that was short of oxygen that her eyes were spinning. Fortunately, Akkard held her waist lightly with one arm as she was about to fall forward. Then he took out his handkerchief with his other hand and wiped off the semen between Damia\u2019s white thighs.After cleaning off the damp liquid, the dress managed to look fine when it was lowered. The hem of the clothes was wrinkled, but it didn\u2019t show easily if one didn\u2019t pay attention.\u2018All right, that\u2019s enough.\u2019Akkard, who checked and confirmed her dress and proper appearance, raised his head. The moment he saw Damia\u2019s face, his masculine eyebrows immediately drew into a frown.\u2018I don\u2019t think I can do this.\u2019It was as if he had made a rose grow into full bloom. Damia\u2019s disheveled appearance was highly provoking. The always neat hair was disheveled and added a decadent beauty, and the traces of tears on the white face were shiny.She had bit her lips to swallow her moans, and her swollen red lips like buds were full of teeth marks. The tip of her nose was swollen, and her eyes were so wet that it was terribly sexy. Anyone looking at that face would surely be able to smell their nasty dirty love affair a mile away.\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here.\u201dAkkard opened the locker door without hesitation and brought Damia out. Fortunately, the hallway where the maid ran away was empty, and no one was there. They could breathe easier in the cool hallway, releasing hot heat from the locker.\u2018It would be better to get some rest around here.\u2019After seeing Damia\u2019s face stained with tears, Akkard thought such. He looked around with an indifferent glance to find out where it would be most suitable to rest.It seemed necessary to wipe Damia\u2019s wet face to cool it down and to calm the lingering feelings of the affair. And in the meantime, he could comfort her, and it\u2019d be great if he could convince her do it one more time.Akkard looked at Damia with a deeper look, wanting to fill his appetite. Damia suddenly threw away his arm, which was supporting her.Wack!!It was so hard that it sounded like he had been slapped. Akkard frowned and rubbed his arm reflexively. It didn\u2019t hurt much, but it was unpleasant to be suddenly rejected and shaken off.\u201cWhat\u2026.\u201dAkkard was about to reproach her when the sight that met his eyes stopped him cold in his tracks. Not even reaching his chin was Damia\u2019s face staring at him with tearful eyes.Her face, was a mixture of resentment, shame, love, hatred and sorrow\u2013it was shockingly raw. Strangely, the moment he saw her face, he felt like time around him stopped.He couldn\u2019t take my eyes off her face as if he had been beaten hard in the chest and couldn\u2019t breathe.Because of this, Akkard hesitated unexpectedly. That\u2019s when Damia burst into tears, her face distorted.\u201cGasp!\u201dShe didn\u2019t ask Akkard to console her or hit or blame him or get angry.Instead, Damia\u2019s choice was to completely ignore him. She completely estranged Akkard from her feelings. Like he wasn\u2019t even there.Damia, whose face was dripping with tears, turned her back with both hands, and with her weak legs, took steps and moved away from him.Stunned, Akkard looked blankly at her back. The sight of her walking alone in the empty hallway was strangely carved into his retina.Her straight, slim back.Her back stubbornly turned away from Akkard. As he stared at it, he suddenly felt a strong intuition.I don\u2019t know why, but I know that I\u2019m never going to forget that back.But there was nothing he could do. Damia Primula never looked back while traversing that long corridor.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Her stepmother, Noella, worriedly eyed her.Only then did Damia realize that she had frozen mid-bite, embroiled in her thoughts. Perhaps yesterday\u2019s incident had shocked her more than she had initially thought.\u2018I told myself that I was bitten by a stray dog and tried to forget.\u2019It didn\u2019t work out as well as she hoped. She was angry at Akkard, who made her look like a cheap courtesan, and hated herself for being swept up in lust under his hands. When Damia recalled what happened in the locker, her face burned with shame.Damia naturally had a serene, thoughtful face. Noella looked at her beautiful adopted daughter\u2019s face like a master scuptures\u2019 masterpiece. And asked very carefully.\u201cThe food on your plate hasn\u2019t decreased for a while now. What is bothering you so much, Damia? What\u2019s the matter?\u201cAh-Abu-bu!\u201dAs if to counter Noella\u2019s words, Leon, Damia\u2019s young half-brother, waved a baby fork and shouted.Damia laughed a little at his bright loveliness and then met Noella\u2019s gaze.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s just that\u2026 there\u2019s a lot of household affairs to worry about.\u201dUsually, the Lord\u2019s wife handled a family\u2019s internal affairs, but in the case of Count Primula\u2019s house, the daughter, Damia, managed the household affairs.This was her father\u2019s consideration for Damia, who had given his only daughter all the power early in his second marriage. It was also an attempt to prevent a possible battle for succession.\u201cI see.\u201dWhen the topic of household affairs came out, Noella immediately lowered her eyelashes. Damia could never guess her thoughts. What did she frankly think of the household affairs and internal power in Damia\u2019s hands?Noella, who was the daughter of a poor baron, became a widow when her husband passed away. As a widow with a child she retreated to a temple to live and pray for the rest of her life. But accidentally, on business, she was spotted by Count Primula, and they remarried.The House of Primula, although it had the moderate status of Countdom, was one of the most prestigious families in the North. Perhaps that\u2019s why Noella looked intimidated in front of Damia even though she was her stepmother.Sometimes she was so timid that Damia often felt uncomfortable. Just like now.\u201cI think you\u2019re very busy these days, Damia. You don\u2019t come home, and you often stay out\u2026! Of course, I\u2019m not trying to interfere with your personal life. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m just worried about you\u2013\u201cNoella couldn\u2019t even make eye contact and babbled. She had an oddly young girlish attitude even now with two children. Perhaps that\u2019s why Damia even felt like she was that one villainess who bullied her.\u201cNo, I\u2019m grateful that you\u2019re worried about me. It\u2019s been a long time since we\u2019ve had a meal together, and I\u2019m sorry for thinking, Mother.\u201dTrying to shake off the uncomfortable air, Damia replied with a meek and sympathetic tone. Then, Noella\u2019s anxious face soon turned bright.\u201cThank you for saying that, Dami; I was just\u2026 lonely without you. You know, we\u2019re the only ones in this spacious mansion.\u201dNoella said, reaching out and hugging Leon. Damia knew what she meant. Her father, Count Primula, was absent\u2014 as was Noella\u2019s son Cesare. Therefore, the only woman and children in the mansion.\u2018But there are so many employees.\u2019Damia glanced at the maid who was busily carrying food from the kitchen, but Noella, who didn\u2019t notice the focus of her attention, sighed deeply and brought up Cesare\u2019s story.\u201cHe followed the Count to Daeshin, but I haven\u2019t heard from him yet. I\u2019m worried if he arrived safely and if he is learning the business from the Count now.\u201dNoella forced herself to laugh, mentioning that it was no use raising sons who often grew up to be so unthoughtful and unfilial. In the meantime, she covered Leon\u2019s ears in case he could understand her.\u201cDon\u2019t worry too much, Mother. Brother Cesare\u2026\u2026\u201dDamia wanted to tell her that he was smart so that he could take good care of himself. However, compliments about Cesare could not come out of her mouth. Especially now that she knew he was up to something.Louise said Cesare would definitely bring \u2018the goods\u2019 from the Daeshin battlefield. And he would feed it to Cecil. What the hell is that \u2018thing\u2019?Maybe it\u2019s a neurotoxin?

She was not the type to have light and shallow friendships with everyone. One of the only people she could trust and open her heart to was Cecil, who was very precious to her.Now her childhood friend and long-time unrequited love, Kael, had already left so if she lost Cecil too\u2026\u2026 Damia couldn\u2019t breathe, just imagining it.Fortunately, Noella didn\u2019t notice Damia\u2019s pale complexion and was busy wiping Leon\u2019s chin full of leaking food. Without much thought, she took Damia\u2019s words at face value and started to speak.\u201cYeah, Cesare is smart and capable, so he\u2019ll be okay. He\u2019ll be right back home as soon as he finishes his work in Daeshin. There\u2019s also a saying that no news is good news. Right?\u201cAhahhahaha!\u201d\u201dInstead of Damia responding, Leon burst into crystal laughter in response. The child with blue eyes and blonde hair was as cute as an angel. So Dami was able to let go of her worries for a short moment.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.Yes, everything will be fine, Mother.\u201dDamia spit out insincere words and held back a sigh.Noella was definitely a good person for a stepmother. Maybe she actually thought Damia as her family when it came down to it.But Damia knew for certain that it wasn\u2019t the case for Cesare. He obviously treated Damia as a woman, not a sister, so Damia was not about to consider him as family.\u2018So I\u2019ll choose Cecil.\u2019She felt sorry for her stepmother, Noella, but she was determined to stop Cesare by any means necessary.For the sake of her friend Cecil, and for the future of Count Primula.After dinner, Dami went up to her bedroom. In a familiar and cozy bedroom, her heart became calm.The cool breeze of the summer night blew over the slightly open window. Damia, who was breathing in pleasantly, suddenly smelled a subtle lilac scent mixed with the wind.\u2018That\u2019s weird. It\u2019s not the season for lilacs.\u2019Damia looked out the window into the garden but couldn\u2019t see any lilacs either. But somewhere in her room, there was definitely a scent.Damia\u2019s eyes searched her room. Suddenly, she saw a bunch of dried lilac flowers hanging between the lovely canopy decorations by the bedside. It was a bouquet of flowers that she had somehow missed.\u201cThis..\u2026.\u201dDamia frowned when she recalled the identity of the bouquet. It was a bouquet that Akkard gave her on the day he had first visited the mansion.After receiving it, she put it down somewhere and completely forgot about it. But why is this bouquet hanging by her bedside? And so carefully dried?As she wondered, Damia finally decided to call a maid and ask her. Fortunately, the maid in charge of Damia\u2019s bedroom knew the answer.\u201cOh, the bouquet was ordered by Mrs. Noella, so I put it back, miss.\u201d\u201cMother? Why?\u201d\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know\u2026 ..sorry.The maid, who tilted her head as if she was puzzled, smiled awkwardly. While looking at this, Damia suddenly realized Noella\u2019s thoughts. She dried the bouquet her adopted daughter received from the man with a girlish romantic attitude and brought it back to commemorate it. Perhaps she wanted it to remain a good memory for Damia.She appreciated Noella\u2019s thoughtfulness, but it made life difficult for her. Damia didn\u2019t even want to see Akkard Valerian\u2019s face. Considering that his face was probably the best in the whole kingdom or perhaps the best in the world was a testament to how much Damia\u2019s mind had turned against him.However, she couldn\u2019t throw away the bouquet that Noella had prepared for her with so much care. Especially in front of the maid.\u201cThank you for letting me know. You can go now.\u201dAfter sighing, Damia finally decided to ignore the bouquet. Just like when she turned away from Akkard in the hallway that day.\u201cYes, miss. Have a good night.\u201dThe servant girl who knew nothing left the room with a polite bow. Damia, who was left alone, lay on the bed with a throbbing head.She was very exhausted from both Akkard Valerian and Cesare.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The fallen lilacs made a spectacle all over the bed. The dried flower leaves were crumbly and scattered on the sheet, becoming powdery.Damia, who was too tired to deal with it, roughly pushed the flowers away with her hands and lay down again. She would deal with it in the morning by telling the maid to clean up after she slept with it.\u201c\u2026\u2026!!\u201dIt was at that moment when Damia inadvertently turned around to fall back asleep that an uninvited guest caught the corner of her eye. Hidden in the shadows, Damia was startled. As soon as she found out who it was, Damia was literally surprised to the point where her blood froze in her vein.\u201cAh\u2014 you\u2019re awake? I thought I was being careful.\u201dA little away from her bed, there was Cesare, sitting on a chair next to a table. He was looking at her and laughed. At first, she thought it was an illusion, but it was real.\u201cHi, Damia.\u201d\u201c\u2026..Brother?\u201dPale-faced, Damia sat up. She was so flustered and alarmed that she couldn\u2019t even scream. As far as she knew, Cesare had followed her father to the Temple. But how did he suddenly arrive in her bedroom?She hadn\u2019t heard of Cesare\u2019s return yet. Even if he arrived late at night\u2014 why would he hide in her bedroom and watch her sleep?\u2018Danger.\u2019Alarms alerted her whole body.She was trapped in a locked room with Cesare alone. Her heart started to beat in panic, and goosebumps ran down her spine. This was exactly how the mouse felt trapped in a corner by a rattlesnake. She didn\u2019t even blink in case the snake would strike.\u201cWhy are you so surprised, Damia? Like someone caught doing something wrong.\u201dCesare whispered smoothly with a strangely soft smile. He got up from his seat and approached the bed.He was a handsome, well-built young man, so as he bent over her he cast a large shadow over Damia\u2019s body. He came up to her nose and caressed Damia\u2019s long loose hair.It was an icy and sticky touch. It was unpleasant, like an invisible spider web that sought to stick and entangle her.Cesare\u2019s eyes narrowed as he smiled, uttering insulting words in a light tone.\u201cI\u2019m glad to see you again. You\u2019ve gotten prettier. While I was gone, did you have fun with Akkard Valerian?\u201dFeeling the sting of stigma, Damia clutched her molars. She wanted to scream right away and call someone. But it was too dangerous. If she did manage to scream, it would take too long for attendants to reach her room.It would be much faster for Cesare in front of her to wield his hands against her.Cesare could easily crush her, easily using his weight against her and do something irreversible if he wanted. When Damia realized the situation, she felt as if she was dumped in cold water.I can\u2019t show fear in this situation.With determination, Damia opened her mouth:\u201cWhat the hell is this, brother? Sneaking into someone else\u2019s bedroom so late at night.\u201dDamia\u2019s face looked up at Cesare, which was much bigger and stronger than hers and calm. On the contrary, he showed a slight hint of displeasure.Cesare\u2019s hand rubbing the tip of Damia\u2019s hair, halted. He stared at Damia as if he was trying to smell fear.His eyes, which glowed incredibly toxic blue in the dark, shined like glass beads. Even though it chilled her spine, Damia did not avoid his gaze. Instead, Cesare\u2019s eyes turned away first.He inadvertently lowered his eyes and found the remains of the lilac flowers scattered over her bed. At that moment, his red lips twisted strangely.\u201cThis\u2026.. I guess this is what he gave you. Did you have a good time playing with his sloppy bottoms? He\u2019s not the kind of person to do this strange thing.\u201dHis cold fingers grabbed a handful of the dried lilacs. The fragile flowers screamed in the cruel hand of his as he crumbled them into a fine powder.He repeated it and repeated it. The act seemed to give Damia an unspoken warning.Damia gritted her teeth. She didn\u2019t want to be questioned by Cesare like a sinner and didn\u2019t want to play into feeding his dangerous abnormal behavior.Therefore, Damia decided to take the offense. She ignored Cesare\u2019s words and accused him directly.\u201cI know brother is planning something. Please be honest. What did you do at the Temple?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As you know, I only assisted \u2018Father\u2019 in his business.\u201dOf course, Cesare was not easily shaken and spoke of her father in a counterattack against her.\u201cIn the meantime, I\u2019ve talked to Father about your recent behavior. Oh my, Dami, how can you spread your legs to such a promiscuous man?\u201d\u201c\u2026..\u201d\u201cFather didn\u2019t like it very much,\u201d Cesare added, pretending to be regretful. Damia bit her lips gently.Her relationship with men, the fact that it entered her father\u2019s ear, was awful and embarrassing. Damia did not want to disappoint her father, who was one of her only remaining blood relatives. Cesare knew that and must have been aiming to try and hurt Damia.\u2018Then I succeeded.\u2019Damia held her head up high even though she wanted to cry. Cesare was trying to rile her up and distract her from the main point. She didn\u2019t fall for provocation and just steadily looked at him.\u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense. I know everything. About the \u2018things\u2019 Brother brought from the temple.\u201dFor a flicker of a second, Cesare\u2019s relaxed face hardened.\u201cWhat do you mean? All I brought from the Temple is the accounting book. I can show it to you if you want.\u201dCesare immediately recovered his poker face and spoke casually, but Damie could tell. Cesare\u2019s eyes, glancing at her face, were unsteady.\u2018I\u2019m not sure what to say. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m really talking about.\u2019Of course, Damia didn\u2019t know what those\u2019 things\u2019 were. She was only pretending to know. Fortunately, she still had more information she had overheard in the locker in her arsenal.\u201cWhat do you mean, only ledgers? Brother.\u201dDamia grinned as she looked at his face stained with lies and masks.\u201cI don\u2019t think you can feed my friend accounting books, right?\u201dCesare\u2019s expression completely disappeared. Damia\u2019s last hand was very effective. Even if she used it, without knowing the power, the fact changed.\u201cLeave Cecil alone \u2014and me, too.\u201dConfident of victory, Damia warned him for the last time. Cesare was still silent. His face, shadowed by the moonlight, was strangely creepy, and Damia got an ominous feeling.\u201cIf you have nothing more to say, please leave my bedroom.\u201d\u201c\u2026and if I don\u2019t want to?\u201dFinally, Cesare spoke. At a shallow glance, it seemed to be a joke with his gentle smile.But behind that smile, the tension snapped and broke through. Damia instinctively moved away to get away from him. At the same time, she issued an ultimatum at Cesare.\u201cGet out! Or I\u2019ll scream.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re going to scream? Oh dear.\u201dHe grabbed Damia\u2019s neck like a bolt of lightning. The grip would be able to snap her fragile neck in an instant.Feeling a sense of crisis, blood drained out of Damia\u2019s face. Cesare smiled happily, looking down at her face white as a sheet of paper in the dark. Then he groped Damia\u2019s neck and pressed down on the round vocal cords that looked like peach seeds.Damia gasped as she felt her throat pressed. Fortunately, she was not being suffocated, but her voice did not come out.\u201cShh. Don\u2019t be afraid, Dami. I can\u2019t hurt you. I just want to give you some advice. As your brother, no matter what.\u201dCesare\u2019s voice was creepily sweet. It wasn\u2019t the voice of a man holding someone else\u2019s neck. Damia felt an even greater dread of danger when her heart heard it.\u201cOh, lovely Damia, I don\u2019t care who you play with. Just because there\u2019s some dirt on the jewelry doesn\u2019t mean it affects the price. If you brush it off and get rid of it, everything is fine.\u201dIsn\u2019t it? Whispering, Cesare grazed Damia\u2019s neck with his thumb as if he were ecstatic. Then he kissed her on the back of her hand while clenching her neck. Staring into her eyes as if he wanted to kiss Damia directly but wouldn\u2019t dare.\u201cBut not just Akkard Valerian. He\u2019s too annoying. You don\u2019t know what he\u2019s hiding, do you?\u201dIt was a strange nuance. As if Akkard approached her because he had something to do with her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This was absolutely ridiculous.Originally Cesare should have had no status\u2014he was a liability that her stepmother brought in. Instead, Damia was in charge of all the mansion\u2019s internal affairs, replacing her absent father. Cesare, a completely unrelated person to the Count of Primula, should have had no space nor power to intervene in her affairs.But Cesare cleverly established his place outside the family. Over the years, he took over the social world by bringing in young northern aristocrats to his side and setting up some small businesses using his personal connections.Damia\u2019s father, a businessman, encouraged his stepson\u2019s efforts and, while underestimating him, bestowed many favors upon him. And Cesare was now repaying her family\u2019s favor as an enemy.\u2018How do I get out of his grasp?\u2019Damia desperately swirled her head and glared at Cesare. Cesare smiled as if he was pleased and flattered to monopolize her attention. It seemed so sincere Damia felt even more disgusted.\u201cListen to me, Damia. You\u2019re also part of the proud Count Primula of the North. Unlike the south, which suffers from pollution, our north is thriving under the Temple\u2019s protection. But nothing good will come about by playing with a royal dog like Akkard Valerian.\u201dCesare\u2019s tone actually resembled a concerned blood-related brother\u2019s voice and momentarily stunned an unprepared Damia. She frowned and tried to understand his words.\u2018What\u2019s this? Is the Temple involved\u2026 ..in Cesare\u2019s work?\u2019And presumably, the Akkard was, probably, standing at a counterpoint\u2014against him. Cesare\u2019s face, who dared to \u201cadvise\u201d Damia, was overflowing with unclothed obsession. But apart from that, his blue eyes remained rational.\u2018He is not just saying this because he is jealous of Akkard.\u2019Damia became more anxious as more questions came up. She wanted to provoke and dig up more information from Cesare but couldn\u2019t because she was being strangled.On the other hand, Cesare seemed very smug because he poured out as much bullshit nonsense as he desired. Cesare stroked Damia\u2019s cheek with his other hand not on her neck and whispered affectionately.\u201cAre you so concerned about Cecil Evergreen? Then choose me, Damia, because if you\u2019re also on my side, all difficulties will be solved.\u201dCesare\u2019s face was close to the tip of her nose, willing her to choose him. At the same time, his grip on Damia\u2019s neck tightened; a silent but loud threat.Damia clenched her teeth. Her vocal cords that were crushed by his intense fingertips hurt, and now she was running out of breath but her anger and outrage outweighed her suffering\u2014she would never succumb to Cesare\u2019s threats!So she managed to squeeze out a verbal protest like an underdog cornered.\u201c\u2026\u2026Wheeze, W-Weezing!\u201dDamia scratched the back of Cesare\u2019s hand that was clenching her neck and gasping pitifully. She couldn\u2019t breathe, her delicate face turning red as if she were about to burst, her veins standing blue on my neck. She was on the verge of suffocation.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Damia?\u201dAfter seeing this, Cesare\u2019s hand became reflexively loose. He miscalculated his strength.\u2018Now!\u2019Damia took the opportunity and quickly flipped her shoulders. Unable to keep up with her momentary struggle, Cesare\u2019s hand slipped from her neck. Damia finally escaped from his grasp and shouted as loud as she could.\u201cSave me! Somebody help me!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Cesare looked down at his empty hand that Damia had slipped from with a face that she couldn\u2019t read.Damia thought she saw bitterness in his expression. But the next moment, Cesare surprisingly smiled.\u201cThere\u2019s no point in bringing up my name, Damia. I\u2019m not supposed to be back yet\u2014 so you\u2019d better be smart.\u201d\u201c\u2026..\u201d\u201cAnd don\u2019t spread your legs to him anymore.\u201dDamia frowned as she listened to Cesare\u2019s quick closing remarks. Today, he spoke in enigmas, but Cesare jumped through the window and disappeared before she could organize her thoughts.\u201cMiss, what\u2019s going on?\u2019\u201cAre you all right, my lady?!\u201dThe servants, who rushed in, opened the door and looked inside her room. But Cesare had already left.\u201cDamia, what\u2019s wrong? What\u2019s going on?Noella, who woke up from sleep, appeared with a slightly swollen face and worriedly inquired. Even though Damia was her stepdaughter, she seemed to be sincerely concerned and wondering if something had happened to her. Noella came out in such a hurry that even the slippers on her feet were uneven.\u201cMother.\u201dDamia bit her lips and studied her stepmother\u2019s face. Did Noella know that Cesare is back? If she knew, it would be natural to tell her\u2014but why didn\u2019t you say anything?Damia lowered her eyes to hide her doubts. And lightly apologized politely as if it was nothing.\u201cI must have had a nightmare, Mother. It was so vivid that I thought someone really broke into my room. I\u2019m sorry for the disturbance.\u201dI wanted to bite my tongue to say this even though I didn\u2019t do anything wrong. But now I had to do this.The north was a small place. There were few new faces. Crossing one bridge, and you were bound to bump into someone you knew. However, Damia\u2019s reputation would be in shambles if rumors spread that a mysterious, monstrous man broke into the bedroom of an unmarried virgin.\u2018Maybe that\u2019s what Cesare was aiming for.\u2019Damia was furious, but she stepped back for now. Now there are too many listeners, including employees. Conscious of this, she painted it as if it was no big deal and sent out the servants who were still looking around the room.\u201cSorry for the late-night disturbance. You can all go.\u201d\u201cYes, Miss. Have a good night.\u201dThe servants retreated with puzzled looks and confused expressions. Soon, Damia and Noella were the only ones left in her bedroom.\u201cI\u2019m glad nothing happened. Whew, I was so worried and thought something happened to you.\u201dNoella, relieved and ignorant, held her thumping heart. While the Count, her husband, was away, she would be in trouble if anything happened to his daughter. She thought it was fortunate that it was just a nightmare.\u201cYou\u2019re so mature that I thought you were fully grown-up, but even you have days like this.\u201dNoella, who covered her mouth and laughed in relief, was about to turn around. But Damia quickly reached out and grabbed her sleeve. She whispered quietly in her ear, who looked back startled and curious.\u201cBut it\u2019s weird, Mother. When I woke up\u2026 I saw my brother, Cesare.\u201dIn my bedroom.Noella\u2019s eyes grew big upon hearing Damia\u2019s words. Damia kept her eyes on her face and studied her reaction carefully. Noella scarlet eyes avoided her glaze and as if she was embarrassed, and barely replied:\u201cBut Cesare hasn\u2019t returned from the Temple yet, dear. Besides, he\u2019s not the kind of kid who would sneak into his adult sister\u2019s bedroom\u2026 You probably saw it wrong\u2014 half asleep.Damia lowered her eyes, guarding her expression. It was an answer as she expected. That\u2019s why Cesare had warned her that it was no use mentioning his name.Well, if she said someone who wasn\u2019t here broke into the bedroom. Who would believe what Damia said? There was no doubt that her accusation would be dismissed as a dream.Even if Damia insisted and seriously announced the issue, the loss was more significant than the gain. An unrelated step-brother hid in his sister\u2019s bedroom in the middle of the night\u2014Ha.There would be no greater scandal in the northern conservative community. Damia\u2019s precious family would become abused in the evil gossiping mouthpiece of the people.When Damia thought of her family\u2019s honor being defiled and torn into pieces countless times\u2014there was only one possible answer.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026. Yes. Since I was sleeping, I might have misseen it. \u201cBut one day, I will make Chesare pay for what he did.Damia smiled, picture-perfect, as she suppressed her seething insides.Cesare was obviously visibly agitated when she brought up the \u201cthings\u201d with the Temple. It was the first time that she had seen him so flustered, as sneaky and cunning as he was, like a snake.\u2018It must be important.\u2019Who should she investigate to learn more about these items? Akkard? They overheard the same conversation in the locker together\u2026. did he understand what that conversation meant?Damia thought of his hot hand, which was scrambling through her skirt without hesitation, even in the locker. And then Cesare, who squeezed his neck exhorting her to choose him with his persistent eyes\u2026. naturally, a tired sigh flowed out between her lips.\u201cHaaaa.\u201dHer body wasn\u2019t worth a damn to the man she loved, but there were too many people that she didn\u2019t care about who coveted it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Is that true?\u201dCecil freaked out, grabbing both cheeks. She was delighted to see Damia, who visited her even on a rainy day.But the elegant face was now shocked and fearful. It was because of the warning Damia told her.\u201cLouise Ferira is going to feed me something?!\u201d\u201cYes, Cecil.\u201dDamia nodded in confirmation. No matter how hard she tried to watch Cecil, she couldn\u2019t be more careful than Cecil was. It was also Cecil\u2019s responsibility and life, so it was her right to know.\u201cI still don\u2019t know what Louise\u2019s trying to feed you, but\u2026\u201d\u201cPoison! I\u2019m sure it\u2019s poison! Louise Ferira, that girl\u2019s gonna get it!\u201dCecil, who jumped up from his seat, lost her usual composure and became irate. Having suffered from Louise in the past, she was completely outraged.\u201cCalm down, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s poison.\u201d\u201cThen what could it be? Do you think she would give me red ginseng? And wish me to be healthy?!\u201dCecil, who recently named the most popular food imported from the Eastern continent, cried out. There was another reason why she was so sick of Louise.\u201cDami, you know that. The fact that our family has a business with Count Ferira!\u201dYes, the Marquis Evergreen, did business in distributing minerals from the North to the capital. And unfortunately, the supplier for the minerals was Count Ferira.Because of this, Cecil was in angst. She wanted nothing to do with Louise, but because of the family business, she would have to still interact with her\u2014which made it even worse.\u201cIt\u2019s time to renew our annual contract, so we\u2019re meeting next week! I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll poison me then, what should I do? What should I do?!\u201dCecil went back and forth in the room with anxious steps and was at a loss. Damia was looking at her, sighed, and grabbed her hand.\u201cYou\u2019re losing it, Cecil! Sit down for now. Let\u2019s think together.\u201dDamia\u2019s suggestion to think \u201ctogether\u201d worked a little. When one was nervous, it was best to discuss it with one\u2019s best friend.Cecil, who clasped Damia\u2019s hand, slumped on the sofa, muttering,\u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s poison or not\u2014but why would Louise try to make me eat it? What the hell are you after?\u201dI\u2019m sure you\u2019re coveting my southern black pearl brooch that I\u2019ve been hiding.\u00a0Cecil spoke seriously. Just by those words, it was clear that her anxiety was getting to her.\u201cWell\u2026umm.\u201dDamia shook her head with a bitter grimace, racking her head for some possibilities that Louise or Cesare might target Cecil.The Marquis Evergreen, Cecil\u2019s family, was one of the most prestigious families in the North. Therefore, he had a lot of influence, both in business and in personal connections.\u2018So you\u2019re trying to recruit Cecil, the only child.\u2019Damia sighed. It was better when she thought Louise Ferira\u2019s purpose was due to personal resentment. However, she never could have had imagined that there would be a complicated conspiracy involving the Temple and Cesare.\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Cecil, Cesare is back\u2026\u2026. but I don\u2019t know where he\u2019s hiding.\u201dShe needed to find him to get a clue. Damia sighed, pushing back her long hair. Then Cecil, who calmed down a little, responded.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I knew your stepbrother would do something like this one day.\u201d\u201cHow did you know that?\u201d\u201cJust. Just a feeling.\u201d \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026 I\u2019m afraid so. Damia looked at Cecil with a ridiculous look. However, Cecil seemed severe in her own way.\u201cDo you remember? When Kael got a notification for passing the Paladin St. Cage entrance exam.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dDamia nodded her head. How can she forget that day? It was a day when her glass-like world that she had been built up for ten years was broken.It had been Cecil\u2019s birthday. Therefore, many guests, including Damia, were present. Thus, the main character of the day should have been Cecil.Kael\u2019s father, Marquis Roysten, was not a villain. However, his flaw was that he was a little tactless. As soon as he was about to leave the house to attend the Evergreen family party, a letter of acceptance to the Temple arrived.The news of the second son\u2019s acceptance made the Marquis of Roysten jump with joy. He even brought the letter to Cecil\u2019s birthday party. And he was boisterous to everyone in the room, including the person involved, Kael.As a northern aristocrat, it was an honor to be able to serve the Temple. Everyone congratulated Kael Roysten on his joining the Saint.Except for Damia and her friend Cecil Evergreen,\u201cThat day, you cried a lot.

Damia was very embarrassed.I definitely remembered how I cried in front of my friend that day, showing everything to the bottom of my heart.The end of the long first love was much worse than expected, and it was just utterly hopeless. If others break up, there was a hope to meet again in the future and for it to work out, but because Kael became a paladin for the Temple he would never be able to meet a woman.Even now, Damia still had aches of pain. Her heart was like a sponge sucked in a lot of bitter water, and when you tap it, it flowed out again.Damia lowered her eyes and pressed down on her dark chest. And she spoke to Cecil with a smile on her face.\u201cBut that day, thank you very much for taking me to your room quickly. Otherwise, everyone would have seen me cry. It\u2019s too horrible to imagine.But after hearing Damia\u2019s words, Cecil\u2019s expression dimmed.\u201cThe truth is, Damia\u2026That day, there was one more person besides me who saw you cry.\u201dDamia\u2019s blue eyes grew bigger at the unexpected words. At that time, Cecil held back an anecdote that she couldn\u2019t bear to tell Damia, who was already suffering from a broken heart. But she thought it was time to tell her.\u201cAs you may have guessed, the one who saw you cry that day is Cesare. \u201cCecil shut her mouth for a moment and gulped. She glanced at Damia\u2019s eyes and continued her words.\u201cWhen I took you to my room, I accidentally turned my head and made eye contact with Cesare.\u201dIn fact, it wasn\u2019t once or twice. While Cecil was with Damia, she would suddenly look back. It was because she felt an unknown gaze peering at them from somewhere.So when she look back, there was always Cesare was always around, curiously. Even while he walked and talked to others, as he regularly did\u2014even while moving, he was always looking at Damia. It was as if his world revolved around Damia.\u201cThat day, Cesare kept watching you. And\u2026.. when you burst into tears, he laughed. Very brightly.\u201dCecil, who finished talking, trembled. When she remembered Cesare\u2019s expression, goosebumps spread through her spine.\u2018He\u2019s a monster.\u2019Cecil sincerely thought that from the bottom of her heart.That day, Dami was definitely falling apart. Cecil comforted her weeping and was secretly terrified. She was scared that Damia would break into pieces in her arms and would never be the same.But Cesare smiled very happily at the sight. The corners of his mouth, which always had a subtle smile, were raised to reveal his white teeth, and his intelligent blue eyes were completely thin in glee that they were invisible.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026It was like that.\u201dThe smile disappeared from Damia\u2019s face when she heard the story. She thought of Cesare\u2019s face while strangling her by infiltrating into her bedroom.So cleverly controlled his strength that not even the common bruise remained afterward. Even that was very sly like the intelligent Cesare.Damia, while recalling him, suddenly had a sharp headache. Cesare was plotting to feed Cecil something. And then there was his insane obsession with her.There are many riddles to solve, but there was no way to really know the truth. Damia thought of some people who might be a clue. And at the end of her thoughts, there was always that man:\u2018Akkard Valerian.\u2019Of course, she hated the idea of seeing him again. Damia still remembered the shame and misery she felt in her locker that day.Damia, who was an expert in unrequited love, knew. If the other person means anything to you\u2014you tread around them carefully and strive to look good in front of them.Originally, the person who fell in love with first was the sinner. Every second of every minute, the sinner looked at their loved one\u2019s eyes, and fearful of their displeasure or rejection\u2014hyperaware of their every action.That\u2019s what Damia knew about love. No matter how different cultures or genders were, people were essentially the same. So the Akkard Valerian was no exception to this rule.However, he showed what he thought of Damia last time with his actions instead of words. He teased her, a noble lady, in a shabby locker and eventually followed his desires whether she was anxious or not.\u2018You did it because you didn\u2019t have any feelings for me.\u2019\u2026I wish I found it amusing.Damia was resentful of that fact. She also had no heart for Akkard, so it didn\u2019t matter if she didn\u2019t love him. But the fact she meant so little to him was terribly offensive.However, her personal feelings could never be prioritized over Cecil\u2019s safety. Dami was a person who had few people and things she considered precious. Therefore, her priorities were obvious.\u2018I\u2019m gonna have to talk to Lord Akkard.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019ll find a way somehow, so don\u2019t worry too much.\u201dDamia was going to stop by Akkard\u2019s mansion on her way. He was a fickle, mysterious man, but he certainly wouldn\u2019t turn down her visit.\u2018Because you haven\u2019t conquered me completely.\u2019That\u2019s the way a playboy thinks. Instead of thinking of a woman as a person with intelligence and soul, she sees her as an object to own.Damia woke herself up from her cynical thoughts. Then Cecil frowned and asked again,\u201cWhat? You\u2019re going now? While it\u2019s raining like that outside.\u201dShe pointed outside the window at the summer-time rain. It was neither a light rain nor a heavy pouring rain.\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019m going to take a carriage anyway.\u201dDamia had already made her uncomfortable decision. Her voice was light, but her blue eyes had a gloom similar to a pool of water that was puddled outside the window.Seeing this, Cecil resigned and sighed deeply.\u201cYes, you are probably very troubled too. You should go home and get some rest as well.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to see me out.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t plan to anyway because it was raining.\u201dCecil, who snorted, laughed. She saw her cat-like mouth and Dami, who was also depressed, and laughed unintentionally.\u201cYes, laugh like that. Because you\u2019re the prettiest when you\u2019re happy. \u201cCecil, lying face down on the sofa, gently waved her hand goodbye.Thanks to you, I feel much better.As expected, a friend was the best.\u2018So I\u2019ll never let anyone hurt Cecil.\u2019Never.***The road to Akkard\u2019s mansion was quiet. The wet ground was softer than usual, so the carriage hardly rattled. Add to this the languor of a rainy day. Damia fell asleep quickly and closed her eyes.Rumble-\u201cHmm?\u201dHer eyes opened wide at the same time as she felt her body leaning to one side. Damia unconsciously touched the wall of the carriage even though he was half asleep.\u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019Barely awake, she immediately checked outside her window. I thought it was a dream, but the reality was the carriage was truly tilted to one side. Just in time, the restless coachman found her looking outside the window and shouted.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, miss! The wheels must be bent because of the rain, and the spare wheel is missing.\u201d\u201cThe wheel\u2019s missing?\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s raining, so just stay in the carriage, and I\u2019ll try to pull the wheel out somehow.\u201dThe coachman was confused and shook his head. He strained himself and began to groan as he tried to lift the twisted wheel in the mud.Damia looked at the scene out of the window, bashful and uncertain. This was the first time something like this had happened. She glanced at the robes of the muddy horseman.\u2018You look tired.\u2019The coachman was still strong, but Damia knew he was in his mid-40s. However, it would have been hard to pull out the heavy wagon wheel alone. And even more so if Damia remained inside.The horseman was now almost invisible because of the mud. I felt sorry for the sight of him picking up the wheels with both arms, grunting and trying to wipe the dirt off of his shoulders.When Dami saw this, she made up her mind.\u201cI\u2019ll just get off and wait. Bring me an umbrella.\u201d\u201cBut miss, are you okay? If you catch a cold outside\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s still summer, plus won\u2019t it take much longer if I\u2019m on it?\u201dDamia, who opened the door, willingly stepped down to the ground. Her spotless new skirt was soon marred by mud. Damia, who looked down at the dress with a deep regretful sigh, soon gave up her lingering affection.\u201cHere, clean your face.\u201d\u201cThank you very much, miss! I\u2019ll be done in a minute.\u201dThe coachman who received her handkerchief was moved to tears with elation. Damia, who opened her umbrella, stepped back so that the horseman could work.She didn\u2019t even remember how long it had been since she held an umbrella herself. The feeling of raindrops bumping into each other on top of the thin umbrella was refreshing. Damia watched the back of the struggling horseman while spinning her umbrella around.\u201cArghhhh!\u201dThe horseman raised the wheel with a voice of victory. Since Damia was off the carriage, lifting the wheels was more manageable than before.But that was it. The muddy mud clung to the wheel like a stiff dough and did not fall off. Because of this, the coachman continued to struggle hard.As time passed, the sun had long crossed over the mountains. The rain had weakened, but it hadn\u2019t stopped. Damia\u2019s dress, which had been standing under a weak umbrella for hours, was also completely wet at the bottom.\u2018It\u2019s cold.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When the wind started to blow, her hands holding umbrellas naturally lost strength.Damia could hear her teeth chattering as she shivered. The coachman was doing his best, but he was too weak to do anymore.She thought he might collapse at this rate.\u201cIs it far from here to home? How long would it take to walk?\u201d\u201cIf I walk, it\u2019ll take at least three hours. I\u2019m sorry, miss\u2026.\u201dThe horseman\u2019s face, which seemed to be miserable, was also pale with the cold. It was a complicated situation.It was just then. Across the dark forest road, a bright light was seen flashing.\u2018\u2026\u2026is that a carriage?\u2019Damia\u2019s eyes opened wide. The light she saw was a lantern swinging from the front of the carriage. To her delight, two robust black horses were approaching this way.\u201cIt must be a passing carriage! That\u2019s great. Lady, I\u2019ll ask for help.\u201dDamia\u2019s coachman waved his hand with a hopeful face.\u201cHere, please help!\u201dFortunately, the carriage did stop. He was a little wet in the rain, but the other horseman, dressed up, halted. Then he asked Damia\u2019s coachman back.\u201cWhich family do you belong to, and why do you hail us?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m the coachman of the Count Primula. My lady\u2019s carriage was stuck in the rain because the wheels fell off. Could you give me some help?\u201dUnexpectedly, a reply to the earnest request came from far behind.\u201c\u2026\u2026 Count Primula?\u201dThe voice that came through the rain was heavy and had a clear presence. When Damia heard the voice, blood drained from her cheeks.She didn\u2019t even have to check the carriage to know who it was. But the shiny black carriage door gears opened and revealed a figure under a dimly swaying light.The face of the man with a robust physique and unusual silver hair was breathtakingly gorgeous. And it seemed that dangerous. His eyes, sharp and intense like a predator, slowly scanned Damia.Amidst the falling rain, their eyes met. As he glanced at Damia under his white eyelashes, he raised his lips into a smirk.\u201c\u2026\u2026then I\u2019d be happy to help.\u201dAs soon as Akkard\u2019s permission was given, the work went smoothly. The two coachmen worked together and began to pull the wheels of the carriage together.Damia watched the scene under her umbrella. She had held the umbrella for so long that my fingertips were cold and my arms were numb. The umbrella kept slipping due to the moisture on the handle and where it hit her shoulder was also aching with pain.Damia tried to rubbed off the water on the palm of her hand on her dress and switched her umbrella to her other hand. But that hand was also wet, so it didn\u2019t do much good.\u201cDami.\u201dAkkard called her through the half-open carriage door. with a seductive smile on his face.\u201cStop getting rained on and come into the carriage.Hurry.Under the shimmering light, his shaded face his face was beautiful enough to enchant.Was he the legendary demon that plundered the bodies and minds of virgins, leading them to death?His overly straight and sharp face gave off a rather cold impression. The combination of thick eyebrows and vivid purple eyes with towering nose and manly lips created a unique atmosphere of his own.But when he smiled, he looked especially sweet, and the gap between those expressions made many hearts flutter. An illusion of a fierce and arrogant man smiling at her only, falling into delusion that she has become a special woman.Unfortunately, Damia wasn\u2019t such a woman. She glanced at Akkard\u2019s handsome face smiling. And then she realized:\u2018He\u2026 he hasn\u2019t reflected on what happened in the locker at all.\u2019If you cared about me at all, you would have noticed by now. And today, you would have asked me why I was angry.\u2018No, you have already apologized before today.\u2019If it was awkward to face each other in person, he could have sent a letter at least. That\u2019s what sincerity means.But Akkard didn\u2019t. He\u2019s just\u2026 ignored Damia\u2019s reaction that day as if it had never happened. He didn\u2019t even consider the fact that she was hurt or sincerely angry.Or even so, he doesn\u2019t even feel worth it to comfort her.\u201cStop being stubborn. You\u2019ll catch a cold.\u201dAnd now he was trying to lure Damia with a sweeter voice. Like an owner trying to entice a dog that was kicked once.\u2018Ah.\u2019At that moment, Damia suddenly realized something:That she would never love Akkad Valerian.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As he looked out the window, he muttered to himself.\u201cIt\u2019s raining.\u201dHe didn\u2019t like rainy days very much. It was because it tended to make people too sentimental. Just like the soil soaked in the rain flowed down and revealed the trash buried under it, his repressed thoughts were also revealed.\u201cOh, no, sir Akkard\u2026\u2026\u201dDamia\u2019s white and smooth skin contained flowers [t1v:aka hickies] in several places. Her body looked delicious, as if it would produce sweet juice when bitten.Akkard bit her light pink shoulder. Her cold skin was wonderful and stuck to the tip of his lips and tongue.Ah, yes. I knew you were so sweet.Akkard tasted her smooth skin with a slight sweat and growing fervor. He tasted her concave collarbone, the narrow space between her ample breasts, and even the folds on the back of the thighs.Then Damia turned her head back and protested,\u201cNo, don\u2019t lick me like that\u2026\u2026!!\u201dThat damn no was hard to hear, but at this moment, it was meaningless. Damia was helplessly laid bare, her delicate body exposed.What are you going to do now? Akkard, who stretched his lips and laughed at her, tore the bedsheets randomly. And used the cloth to tie Damia\u2019s limbs tightly.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dDamia, who was tied up and hung her neck in front of the animal\u2019s fangs, cried. His pretty blue eyes, full of moisture, made him more enamored with her. He was overwhelmed by the urge to make her cry more harshly.Akkard turned her around roughly. He grabbed her coveted ass and had it raise high in the air. Having taken a vulgar pose, she tried to crawl with her arms bound up, attempting to escape somehow.\u201cStay still!\u201dNow he\u2019d had enough of Damia Primula running away. Akkard growled and pressed her down from the top. And he slapped her white ass, which shook in front of his eyes as if it were a punishment.\u201cAh!\u201dSlapped on the ass, Damia exclaimed, taken aback. Akkard didn\u2019t miss the opportunity, spread her open between her ass cheeks, and stuck in his hard member.\u201cAhhhhh!\u201d\u201cHaaaaaa\u2026\u201dA satisfied groan flowed from Akkard\u2019s mouth. Yes, it was this feeling. She was already wet and so hot and sucking on him so tightly as if she couldn\u2019t get enough of him.It was a fucking delicious body. It was a bad thing for her, who shook her body in front of his eyes as if she were going to give it away.Once again, Akkard put his pillar-like penis, the size of a child\u2019s forearm, all the way to the root. Damia received the hideous object, moaned, overwhelmed. Her usually haughty-looking face whimpered helplessly, eyes fluttering in confusion, not knowing what to do with this pleasure.Squeeze- slap- squeeze- slap\u2014Holding Damia up via her tied-up wrists pulled back, and he began to do waist work.He felt a sense of pleasure melting every sense time he violently rammed his member all the way in and pulled it out.He shook his back roughly, poking, thrusting, and digging inside her. Whether Damia cried or not, he pressed down her white, sweet body in front of him greedily, grinding her narrow inner flesh together and deeply penetrating her.The tight and hot inner flesh quickly made him feel on the verge of ejaculation. He clung to Damia\u2019s back and thrusted. Every time he dug through her legs faster and more wildly he felt a lot of pleasure.\u201cAh, Damia\u2026!!\u201dAkkard grabbed her long hair and pulled it back. Obscenely his penis had dug deep inside of her.It was that moment. Suddenly, my lower abdomen felt warm and sticky, and my eyes opened. The sweet woman\u2019s naked body disappeared, and I was lying alone on a wet blanket.\u201c\u2026\u2026.Fuck.\u201dIt was a dream.Thanks to this, Akkard had the most humiliating morning in history.He was no innocent adolescent boy to be having dreams like this! He was the great Akkard Valerian!It was unbelievable.Akkard looked at the wet blanket with his eyes filled with shame. But the red-haired beauty, who should have been on it, was nowhere to be seen.\u201cDamia Primula\u2026\u2026.\u201dAkkard clenched his teeth. Women were all the same. Even the most extraordinary beauty was still a person after taking off her clothes and having a few relationships.So Akkard had no particular fantasy about women. And never even thought of them as particularly special or different. But at this moment, it was obvious that if he could sleep with Damia Primula one more time, he would gladly sell his soul.\u201cHa\u201dHowever, the possibility of that was far-reaching. Akkard sat on the edge of his bed and wiped his face slowly with both hands.\u2018She never looked back.\u2019That day, her back, trembling with anger, was thin and straight. Even before Akkard could reach out, she had slipped away. As if she could not tolerate being in the same space as a horrible person like him.It was easy to relive a woman\u2019s anger. They were usually appeased by his expensive gifts or by a watery gaze from him.If that didn\u2019t work out, it would be enough if Akkard turned around pretending to be angry himself. Then the woman was frightened and grabbed on to him.It was ironic because they initially started the game trying to use anger to wield against Akkard. They pretended to be picky, wanted him to look at them, and then wanted Akkard to be subordinate to them forever.But Akkard saw through all their plans. Instead, it was enough to use those weak plans to listen to what the woman wanted and fill his own greed.\u2018But it won\u2019t work for her.\u2019Probably. Akkard got a kick out of his appetite for her with deep regret. Then he rolled up the dirty sheet and stuck it in the trash can.It was as if I was letting go of my lingering desire for Damia Primula.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There, Lesid Ferira made people run around. He spotted Akkard glancing at a small frame and laughed.\u201cAh, that? It\u2019s a portrait that I received as a gift. Isn\u2019t it pretty, right?\u201c\u2026\u2026 a portrait? That doodle?\u201dThe frowning Akkard asked again in disbelief. The character in the painting certainly looked like a person with blond hair and white face, but it was painted so much that it was hard to see the dirty mess unless one was afar.It wasn\u2019t a portrait; it was an abstract impressionistic painting at best. Akkard\u2019s despairing expression made Lesid smile with a relaxed expression.\u201cOh, my! If you knew who the lady was, you would be sorry you said such a thing.\u201d\u201cSo what?\u201dHe couldn\u2019t imagine who it might be to upset him further. When Akkard said so, Lesid\u2019s mouth twitched with a fox-like glee.\u201cYou know her well, don\u2019t you?\u2026 Damia Primula,\u201d whispered Lesid.It was a name that he loathed to hear the most today. Irritated, Akkard glared annoyingly at Lesid\u2019s lips. His delicate lips, which seemed to be drawn with the thinnest fountain pen, ended up mockingly smiling at him.\u201cYou don\u2019t know, but Miss Damia and I took classes from the same art tutor when I was young. We had a great time. I even got a portrait full of sincerity as a gift.\u201dI and her have a history that you don\u2019t know. After showing off, Lesid\u2019s face was in high spirits.Had it been him normally, Akkard would not even have lifted his eyebrows at his bluff. But was it because of his dream this morning? Because right now, he wanted to hit that pleased face.If it weren\u2019t for work, he would have done so. However, it was not possible for a colleague on the same boat to exchange physical blows. Thus, Akkard used words instead of fists to slap Lesid in the face.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you take care of your little sister if you\u2019re set on the girl?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026what do you mean?\u201dLesid\u2019s eyes narrowed as he felt a loaded meaning from Akkard\u2019s brief words.\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201dAkkard smiled insidiously as he recalled the pleasant conversation he had overheard in the locker.***After taking joy in stepping on Lesid\u2019s nose, Akkard headed back home. But the satisfaction was short-lived. It was still raining, so his mood turned dismal again.How did one from the dry, warm south get used to this annoying northern weather? The damp moisture was a nuisance. Akkard swept back his pale hair and unbuttoned the tanned shirt. He felt a little uncomfortable with the thin fabric sticking to his front chest muscles.\u2018I can\u2019t wait to get home.\u2019The horseman, who noticed his owner\u2019s thoughts, diligently drove the horse. Akkard closed his eyes, catching a refreshing night breeze through a gap in the window. The smell of the wet forest permeated through his fluttering hair.But the running in the middle of the night didn\u2019t last that long. At some point, he registered the carriage slowing down, and then it completely stopped.\u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019He heard the driver talking to someone in front of him, and the other person was speaking in an awkward tone as if he was in trouble.\u201cI\u2019m Count Primula\u2019s horseman. My lady\u2019s carriage was stuck in the rain because the wheels fell off.

It would be an omen to taste that sweet body again until he grew sick of it and thoroughly shake off the lingering feelings he had for Damia\u2019s Primula.Akkard licked his fangs and laughed. Before he got off the carriage, he didn\u2019t even bother with glancing at the mirror inside. His appearance, one of his biggest weapons, would be flawless as usual.\u201cDami.\u201dAkkard pulled out his most seductive voice. Like a siren to luring in sailors with her voice.\u201cStop getting rained on and come into the carriage.\u201dThe bass resonating through the humid night air was even pleasing to his ears. Damia\u2019s gaze finally looked his way as if drawn to him.Akkard looked at his face reflected in those pretty eyes. The man with glowing tanned skin, slightly damp hair had eyes shining with lust. He wanted to eat the whole girl in front of him without leaving a bone behind.It was troublesome. Akkard quickly hid his hungry predator-like eyes and disguised his desires with a more caring voice as he beckoned her again:\u201cStop being stubborn. You\u2019ll catch a cold.\u201dIt was that moment. Damia\u2019s gaze that was studying him looked to the ground as if contemplating something.\u2018Hmm?When she looked up at him again again, her eyes had already changed. It was as if she has resigned to something.Her blue eyes, containing no light, looked like broken sapphires. When Akkard met that gaze something felt hollow and eerie in the corner of his heart. But with no time to reflect on the reason, Damia got into his carriage.\u201c\u2026..then excuse me.\u201dAt last, she came into his domain with her own two feet.Akkard took a deep breath. She sat beside her, smelling of flowers and sweet, wet flesh. It was the smell of Damia Primula.As soon as he breathed it in, his body started to heat up. Akkard watched her, licking his chomps. Her white skin covered in droplets looked very soft, and the voluminous breasts shining in the front of her dress made him hungry.He wanted to taste and swallow her up right away, but the memory of his previous failed hunts made him a more cautious predator.\u201cYou must be cold. Here, wear this to keep warm.\u201dAkkard put a coat around her shoulders in a gesture of self-control and to lower Damia\u2019s guard.\u201c\u2026\u2026thank you.\u201dIt must have been cold, but Damia did not refuse his offer. Her fingers shook as she clasped the collar of his overcoat around her shoulders.After shivering in the rain for a long time, she was exhausted and weak. Akkard, as usual with bad guys, was looking for an opportunity before thinking about Damia.\u201cIf you don\u2019t warm up soon, you\u2019ll catch a cold,\u201dmurmuring into her ear, he reached out and embraced Damia\u2019s shoulder. Dami\u2019s body grew stiff. She fell awkwardly into his arms, and then she pulled away, acting as if she did not know his intentions.\u201cCome, give me your hands.\u201dWhen Akkard was in his seducing mode, he knew how to keep going without giving his opponent a chance to breathe. Damia let him hold her hand without refusing him. He was alarmed,\u201c\u2026 it\u2019s cold.\u201dThe hands held together were too cold. Her wet skin was as moist and soft as touching the belly of a freshly caught fish from icy waters.Concerned, Akkard touched her cheek. When his hot hands reached her, Damia sighed and closed her eyes. Apart from her feelings, his body temperature, which warmed up her freezing body, was so sweet that she became fatigued.\u2018Oh\u2026\u2026right, I should ask Lord Akkad about what we heard in the locker that day.\u2019Damia managed to recall her business with a weary head. She opened her mouth, raising her trembling hand, pushing Akkard\u2019s shoulder.\u201cSir Akkard\u2026\u201dUnfortunately, cunning Akkard wasn\u2019t finished. He grabbed Damia\u2019s hand, trying to push him away, and kissed her on her soft palm. And he started to lick between her fingers.Her cold, soft hands with a pleasing scent were like ice chips. His hot lips and tongue rubbed the sweet skin to his heart\u2019s content. Damia tried to pull her hand away, but Akkard quickly asserted,\u201cShh, don\u2019t worry, Damia. Now only think about warming up,\u201dAkkard followed up by tearing off his shirt. His muscular upper body was revealed.

Then Akkard, who licked his red lips, whispered again with a lewd smile,\u201cYes, Damia. Now, only look at me. Don\u2019t think about anything else.\u201dHis sexy voice seemed to melt her ears. The most expensive courtesans in the capital probably aren\u2019t as thrillingly sexy as him.Damia was captivated by his deadly beauty. The smiling Akkard suddenly pushed her down over the carriage seat.\u201cAh!\u201dShe blinked in amazement, and his big body that was emitting heat laid her down. Eventually, his eyes looking down at the poor prey caught in his trap turned red with desire.\u201cDon\u2019t worry\u2014it will be so hot, it\u2019ll melt you.\u201dSomething went wrong. It was a huge mistake to be captivated by a predator and not be on guard.With his head down, he bit the delicate neck of his prey. He felt the extraordinary excitement of sucking her thin skin vigorously. He was thrilled to chew right above her pulsating artery with the tip of his fangs, afraid it was going to be eaten alive.He licked her collarbone, protruding towards his stuck-out tongue, and hurriedly pulled down the front of her dress. But the wet cloth stuck to the skin, so it didn\u2019t go down well.\u201cFuck.\u201dA harsh word seemed to flow out of his lips with a sharp tooth. Even though he acted like an adolescent with his first encounter with a woman and thought he looked like a fool, he was enjoying himself immensely.Ripppp-The hem of the dress, which could not overcome his passion, was torn apart. Above her tight corset, the obscene outlines of her swelling breasts were revealed. When he reached out and pulled out one breast, the pink nipple erect at the tip of the breast he grasped made him go crazy.\u201cOh, Dami.\u201dWhat do I do about it being so sexy and pretty? Akkard groaned a sigh and ravenously rushed and coveted the nipple.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dDamia\u2019s waist lifted up when he strongly sucked her upright nipple. Akkard reached for the opposite chest, caressing it with his tongue.The texture of her moist and jiggly breast stuck to the palm of his hand was incredible, and Akkad rubbed and sucked her breasts greedily to his heart\u2019s content. Then, Damia\u2019s body, which was as cold as a mermaid fresh out of the water, was gradually warming up.\u2018Are you excited?\u2019His mouth dried up thinking so. Damia\u2019s white body, which was light pink, was bright and pretty like a pearl.Neither her disgusting step-brother nor Lessid, who made people mad, could touch this woman. Only he knew this woman\u2019s nakedness and her lewd appearance.When he thought about that, the man\u2019s sneaky urge to monopolize was tightly filledHe instinctively grabbed Damia\u2019s ass cheeks and rubbed his penis between her flat lower abdomen and between her open legs. He was just rubbing it on top of her clothes, but blood was already rushing to the tip of his shaft and swelling hard like a candy.\u201cOh, no!\u201dDamia trembled and tried to push him away. But after starving for so long, he was already in no condition to control himself.\u201cStay still, Damia, if you don\u2019t want to see me go crazy.\u201dAkkard, who pressed her down, warned fiercely.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He loosened the waist of his pants with rapid, urgent hand movements and took out his dark red penis, swollen with blood rushing in. And surprisingly, he began to rub it over Damia\u2019s underwear.\u201cStop\u2026\u201dDamia twisted her waist to get out of his firm grip. But her actions only helped him to rub against her inner flesh.She was embarrassed that the cleavage of her secret between her legs was blatantly exposed even under the thin underwear soaked in liquid. There was nowhere to hide with her thighs wide open. As he skillfully slipped his hot penis in front of her entrance through the gap, her sensual clit began to bloom.Akkard licked his lips and slowly grinded against her bud so he could taste it. They hadn\u2019t even started yet, but it was already delicious enough to make him go insane.He stretched the underwear over her entrance. He rubbed his fingertips over her tight lingerie. Then transparent love liquid flowed out through the fabric.It was like a hot, sweet syrup poured over pancakes. Akkard grinned, taking in the sight, and stretched it out in front of Damia, who turned her head red with shame. Akkard calmly licked his fingers and laughed deeply.\u201cIt tastes very sexy.\u201dShocked at her own response to Akkard, Damia\u2019s eyes reflected her surprise. Akkard thought her eyes were so pretty it made him harder. She was soaking her panties like this yet refusing him as if she didn\u2019t want him.Damia\u2019s conduct was both emotional and cute, and his heart heated up. Akkard bit Damia\u2019s cheek, trying to suppress his rising passion. Without taking off her underwear, he pushed his penis through her entrance.\u201cAhhh\u2014\u2014!\u201dAt the same time, Damia\u2019s eyes grew bigger; her insides became tight. Her body, which had only one night\u2019s experience with him, had forgotten him like a lie. But as Akkard\u2019s fully erect penis pushed in, its thick head widened her insides. She began to swallow his organ tightly even though she didn\u2019t know what she was doing.\u201cHaa!\u201dAkkard\u2019s handsome eyebrows furrowed. Between her legs, where he had been anxious to press in between even in his dreams, was much more ecstatic than he remembered.Akkard gasped as her insides squeezed him as he twitched his way to her narrow inner core. Her body, unfamiliar with sex, didn\u2019t make it easy. He had no choice but to use the smooth love liquid as a lubricant and push it little by little.\u201cHwoo\u2026 [exhale]\u201dAt last, a murky groan flowed from Akkard\u2019s mouth as soon as he inserted himself all the way to his root.It was a truly bloody delicious body. Her insides were wriggling and tightening and hot, that he had already filled up. He haven\u2019t even moved properly yet\u2026. but he felt like he was getting dizzy from the intense anticipation.Akkard sighed with satisfaction. He looked down. Damia, who had tears in her eyelashes, was gasping as if she was struggling with feeling overwhelmed, her eyes tightly closed.Her white face turned red as if she had a fever. It was pitiful to see her chirping and not knowing what to do. As he watched her trembling body, he felt an unrecognizable sense of loveliness.\u201cDamia.\u201dAkkard kissed her cheek, bringing him a heavenly euphoria. And then suddenly he was surprised. It was because the cheeks on his lips were too hot.\u201cDami?\u201dAt his call of concern, Damia shivered, her eyelids trembling. Under her reddish eyelashes, her bewildered blue eyes were revealed. Damia made eye contact with Akkard for a moment when suddenly her eyes rolled to the back of her head, and she fainted.\u201c\u2026\u2026Hey, wake up!! Damia!!\u201dAkkard hurriedly grabbed her shoulder, shook her, and checked her eyes. As he scanned her neck, the heat in his hand was unusual. It was clear that her temperature dropped due to rain, but a fever was rising.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was a matter of course. What emotional connection does he have with Damia Primula?He was about to achieve his long-cherished dream, but Damia fainted!She really knew how to drive people crazy. Akkard grimly frowned. Even now, under him, her insides did not let him go. Perhaps because of the heat, he felt good, as if he would meltdown because her insides were so hot.\u2018Shall we just do it?\u2019Akkad thought. I\u2019m quite feverish, but I\u2019ll catch a cold. If you do something like that, you won\u2019t have too much trouble.However, he was not happy to hold on to her weak body and dig into her. He couldn\u2019t feel the spirit. His taste was to tease a woman until she screamed and begged him. No matter how much he longed for it, he couldn\u2019t enjoy hugging a woman without consciousness.Annoyed, his tongue heavy with complaints, Akkard picked up her clothes and wrapped her body in his coat. He could not wait on the road floor just in case Damia\u2019s carriage would be fixed.He decided to take Damia to his northern mansion. He could take care of her, heal her, and then ask for her body in return for saving her. Dami, who has an unexpected sincerity, will not be able to turn a blind eye to her debt.\u2018And then\u2026\u2026\u2019Without leaving a single tearful appeal left, he would chew and swallow her whole. Akkard grasped her whole body firmly in his arms and smiled with satisfaction.***Damia was very sick for two days. She was a typical noble lady. A beautifully grown woman who used to maids fanning her when it was hot and warm with the finest fur and warm water bags when it was cold.For the first time in her life, she stood in the rain for several hours, so it was inevitable she was sick even more so when her immune system was compromised by stress.\u201cThe fever isn\u2019t going down.\u201dWithout taking off his coat, Akkard stopped by the guest bedroom and muttered. He assumed she might sneeze and catch a little cold, but he didn\u2019t expect her to be this ill.Akkard realized that Damia was very fragile. Her face seemed distressed and was filled with redness from fever. The only time pale Damia turned red like this is when she was sexual\u2026.\u201cDamn me.\u201dAkkard with a frown on his face, swearing at himself quietly. What are you thinking with the patient in front of you?Perhaps it was a mistake to bring Damia to his mansion. But her condition was much worse than expected, so he had decided on the fly. At least his place was much closer than the Primula mansion.It felt bizarre to see Damia lying defenseless in his territory. Akkard, who was sullen for no reason, touched her cheek and muttered,\u201cYou know? You\u2019re the only woman who has taken my bed without having sex.\u201dDamia was asleep, frowned as if protesting against his words. Even in her dream, she seemed to reject his touch, making him more grumpy.Since he can\u2019t do anything serious to the patient, he decided to finish venting by pinching Damia\u2019s cheek in moderation.\u201cUh\u2026\u201dBut Damia was also formidable. While pinching her cheek, she groaned with a grimace, wrinkling her cute nose, and while turning her body and cut his hand off, ending it\u2019s assault with a snuggle.\u201cHey.\u201dAkkard, his hand under Damia\u2019s cheek, clicked his tongue. Her small head was as big as his palm. It cost him no effort to lift her up and pull out his hand.But he couldn\u2019t carry out what he wanted. It was because Damia suddenly rubbed her cheek on his palm as soon as he tried to pull away.At the unexpected contact, Akkard hesitated for a moment. He knew Damia as a woman who always was on guard with a straightened back to shield her vulnerabilities.But the very same Damia was now hanging on to him like a child now. Holding him desperately with both hands, her eyelids shook, and in a hoarse voice, she whispered pitifully,\u201cMom.\u201dAs soon as he heard the voice, his shoulders lost strength, and Akkard recalled some information he knew about her,\u2018Didn\u2019t you live with your stepmother?\u2019Akkard recalled meeting her stepmother, Noella, when he visited Count Primula\u2019s estate before. She was a woman with a weak and timid impression. It seemed unbelievable she gave birth to an ambitious man like Cesare.Even if she had the best character, a stepmother was a stepmother. It seemed like Damia was going through a complicated dream about her mother, stepmother, and family history. Like himself.Her sweaty worn-out face looked much younger than usual. Maybe that\u2019s why? Akkard superimposed a young boy on her. It was his helpless self of the past who had to rely on the protection of his sister Sienna after they lost their parents.\u2018What am I thinking?\u2019Akkard shook his head. There was nothing good about cultivating cheap empathy for a woman who pushed him away. After he pulled out his hand held by Damia, Akkard whispered quietly,\u201cNo matter how much you shout, no one will save you. The only one that can save you is yourself.\u201dIt was cold advice.He let Damia\u2019s hand that had grasped his hand fall on the sheet with a snap.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But her face looked sadder than before.Akkard glanced down at her. Strangely enough, he felt guilty\u2014which was utterly unlike him. She had a fever, and she wasn\u2019t going to remember, so it wouldn\u2019t have cost him anything if he had offered a little bit of comfort and treated her kindly.For unknown reasons, his mouth tasted bitter. Akkard turned his back on her in an effort to shake off his unpleasant mood.Creak-As soon as he had opened the bedroom door, he encountered an unexpected face in the hallway. After seeing him, Akkard opened his mouth in surprise.\u201cButler?\u201dIt was his butler, Sebastian, who was standing there. A faithful servant, Sebastian, who was from the capital, stood outside with a towel and basin.\u201cMaster?\u201dSebastian was also surprised to see Akkard emerging from the guest bedroom. As he knew, the guest had not woken up, so he must have come to check on her.\u2018My master can\u2019t be so considerate\u2026\u2026!!\u2019Akkard was a generous, fair, and respectable master, but he was different when it came to women. Even the most outstanding beauty didn\u2019t hold his interest unless she was warming his bed.But here was Sir Akkard not only bringing a woman to his house but also looking after her illness. Sebastian\u2019s eyes popped open in astonishment and expressed his bewilderment:\u201cYou\u2019re back earlier than scheduled, Master! Did you visit the guest without taking off your coat? What kind of relationship do you have with the lady\u2026?\u201dSebastian, who had been speaking rapidly, realized\u2014Why not? There\u2019s only one emotion that blooms between young men and women.\u2018Ah, finally! The Master has a special person too!\u2019There\u2019s no one who blames an esteemed handsome man for having women. But if you go through so many women, how can there be no one in your heart?Faithful Sebastian cared for his Master since he was born. It was incredibly heartbreaking that the young Master had grown up unfriendly without receiving proper affection in such a harsh environment. So he hoped and prayed for Akkard\u2019s heart throughout the entire time that he stood beside Akkard.\u2018If you do everything you want to do in the future\u2026\u2019\u2026\u2026.And Akkard really grew up like that. It had even proven a little too much for Sebastian, who had christened Sir Akkard as \u201cKind Master\u201d in his heart.Women were wholly captivated while holding Akkard in awe and fear because of his overwhelming presence, wit, and power. There were plenty of nobles in the capital, but no one could compare to Akkard Valerian.Naturally, he was surrounded by women that constantly stole glances at him and blushed. Likewise, Akkard was not a person who refused those good women. He slept with as many women as he pleased, and in the end, he always coolly dumped them.Thanks to this, the social circle of the capital city, which was likened to a wild jungle, shot a drama that would last a long time in history.\u2018It\u2019s like a bunch of lionesses in the heat trying to win over the Lion King.\u2019Akkard\u2019s sister, Sienna, was thoroughly disgusted by his mess. Sebastian felt guilty as if he had misled his young Master.But in the far North, the Master finally found his mate\u2026!!!It was indeed fortunate. Now, he could, fortunately, send back the women who were rushing to the mansion and reply to the love letters and hateful letters.Recalling his hardships, Sebastian\u2019s eyes became teary. Akkard saw his expression and frowned with a sense of foreboding.\u201cHey, you\u2019re thinking about something useless\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, my lord. You don\u2019t have to explain anything to Sebastian.\u201dSebastian put one hand on his chest, pretended to be ignorant and compliant, and bowed his head. At first glance, it was an elegant gesture as usual.But Akkard saw it. An irresistible smile graced his wrinkled lips and his heart-warming eyes glowed.\u201cSeeing that you\u2019ve come back so quickly, you must have been worried about her condition, but don\u2019t worry too much. A famous doctor in the North has just arrived so the lady will be better in no time! Everything will work out.\u201dSebastian\u2019s tone was soothingly sweet, as if he was appeasing a young boy. He did not doubt that Akkard was worried about Damia.\u201cWait, Sebastian\u2026.\u201dAkkard, who belatedly realized his misunderstanding, was about to correct it in a hurry. Right before he could, Damia\u2019s cough came through the small gap in the door.\u201cCough, cough, cough\u2026 This is\u2026?\u201dShe seemed to have finally woken up after nearly three days of slumber. Sebastian was thrilled to hear her voice leaking from the inside.\u201cCome on, let\u2019s go! Doctor, please take a quick look at her condition!\u201dSebastian did not listen to his explanation and pushed the doctor\u2019s back into the room. As the doctor walked in, Sebastian requested, \u201cPlease take good care of her.\u201d He was already acting like a faithful steward who took care of his mistress.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He wanted to jump into the room right away and explain that it wasn\u2019t what Sebastian was thinking. However, if he did so, the misunderstanding would grow bigger, as if he was too embarrassed to admit it.\u2018The plague really doesn\u2019t fit the north.\u2019There was another reason why he quickly returned to the mansion. Akkard, who took out a pocket watch from his vest, glanced at it and clicked his tongue.\u201cIt\u2019s time.\u201dAkkard looked back toward the bedroom door when Damia woke up, turned his back indifferently.It was a pity that he couldn\u2019t clarify himself to Sebastian, but he could not keep the prince waiting because of such a trifling misunderstanding.***Akkard arrived at his room and picked up a magic video sphere. It was time to report to the Crown Prince who sent him here.There was a crackling sound, a bright light shined, and a handsome man with brown hair came into view. The man\u2019s face turned his head this way towards the sphere.\u201cOh, Sir Akkard\u201d\u201cYour Highness, the Crown Prince.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve heard from you. I was beginning to get worried. But seeing that you\u2019ve reached out like this, you seem to have adapted well to the North. Good for you.\u201dThe prince spoke in a thoughtful tone. He seemed to care for his right arm, and it was a remark that any subordinate would be moved by. However, the drawback was that he didn\u2019t seem sincere at all because he was eating chocolate while leaning back with his feet on his desk.\u201cSo isn\u2019t this your first time in the North? How is it? What\u2019s your impression?\u201dAkkard duly replied, looking pitifully at the prince\u2019s hands covered with chocolate,\u201cOf course, it\u2019s boring. It\u2019s small and looks as if it\u2019s at least a decade behind the capital. How can you smoothly devour chocolate when you put people in this place?\u201dHeinrich adamantly protested against Akkard\u2019s scathing reply.\u201cOh my God! How could you say such a terrible thing? With such an important mission, I sent you to the North! You really don\u2019t know my heart!\u201dOn the surface, he seemed outraged, but Heinrich\u2019s eyes were smiling as he pushed another chocolate into his mouth. Akkard saw right through him, knowing the Crown Prince since childhood, and declared coldly.\u201cIf you keep making useless sounds, I\u2019ll hang up. \u201c\u201cNo, don\u2019t hang up!\u201dSince it was Akkard Valerian, he would hang up. Since they knew each other for so long, even asserting the crown prince\u2019s authority didn\u2019t work on Sir Akkard.\u201cPlease save me, Lord Akkard. Umm? I need you to somehow investigate the Temple. At this rate, the whole kingdom is in danger!\u201dAlarmed, Heinrich quickly changed his behavior and begged.Because of the \u201csecret mission,\u201d Akkard, who was the most popular socialite in capital society, was suddenly sent to the impoverished North.The North was a boring place with nothing to see but snow and minerals. However, the only thing to mention was that there was The High Temple.It\u2019s home to the Pope, the Saint, and the Paladins. For this reason, the devoted called the North \u2018The Holy Land.\u2019 However, Heinrich and Akkard, who roughly guessed at the truth, had differing ideas.\u201cI know you\u2019re suffering by going to the North. But you have to find a clue to the \u2018pollution\u2019 that\u2019s plaguing the South and prevent it from growing. If this continues, it will soon spread to the capital.\u201dAkkard\u2019s face darkened. Heinrich was right. The South was almost shut down because of the \u2018contamination\u2019 that blackened the land and prevented crops from growing. If this situation continued to spread across the country, there would literally be a catastrophe.The royal family tried hard to find the source of the pollution but could not find any clues. The only place they did not investigate was the North.So Heinrich sent Akkard as far north as a last resort. It was an extremely risky gamble that relied more on intuition rather than reason.\u201cDon\u2019t forget, Lord Akkard is the last hope of the royal family. \u201cAnd \u2018my\u2019 last hope.The cursed Crown Prince, Heinrich, laughed bitterly. If Akkard found no clues in the North, he would soon be deposed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Rumors have spread that God may have hated the Crown Prince for this very reason.Then the tiny, foolish rumors soon spread like wildfire. When the royal family realized the seriousness of the situation, it was already too late.\u201cDepose the prince who God has abandoned!!\u201dThe protests of the people shouting in front of the royal palace struck the Prince heavily in the chest. He was angry at their stupidity but at the same time pitying them for how gullible they were.He could not give up his crown prince position as things stood. The Prince sent Akkard to the north with bold determination, afraid there would be nothing there.\u201cTo be honest, I\u2019m still not sure, Lord Akkard.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dAkkard asked quietly. Then Heinrich, whose heart weakened, hesitated and quietly spoke,\u201c\u2026\u2026.Is it right to suspect the temple and it\u2019s waging the holy war against the pollution as the mastermind?\u201dAfter hearing this, Akkard narrowed his eyes. He had seemed so confident \u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d he said to Akkard to convince him to go to the North, and now he doubted himself.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, if there\u2019s no evidence, I\u2019ll make it and take it with me,\u201dAkkard responded with a straight face.Despite his confident reply, Heinrich\u2019s face remained doubtful. Something was bothering him.\u201cBut as Lord Akkard knows, \u2018pollution\u201d can be purified by divine power. So I\u2019m sending priests from the High Temple in the north to help the south.\u201d\u201cYes. So what did you mean by that?\u201d\u201cActually, this time, the High Temple\u2026..decided to send the Saint.\u201dHeinrich had a look on his face that he didn\u2019t know what to do. The south is now literally a living hell because of \u2018contamination\u2019. But now the High Temple was sending him the precious Saint.He had never thought they would send her his way.At this point, Heinrich was confused, doubting himself and his decision to send his people to the North. Akkard smiled cynically at the sight of his troubled face.\u201cHmm.\u201dIn short, it was his guilty conscience to doubt the game instead of working hard. It was a feeling that any average person would have. But Akkard\u2019s view, far from the sensibility of ordinary people, was much different.\u201cIf anyone heard you, they would think the High Temple is doing this for free. It\u2019s true they\u2019re helping the south, but won\u2019t they want too much in return?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 You\u2019re right.\u201dHeinrich accepted helplessly. There was no such thing as goodwill without a price in the world.Contamination could only be purified by divine power, so the standing of the High Temple had grown exponentially, and the royal family was forced to comply with the demands of the temple for the sake of the south.What a nerve-wracking vicious cycle it was. Heinrich, who sighed deeply, leaned against the back of his chair.\u201cSo Lord Akkard, you must find out if pollution is just a natural disaster or, as I suspect, the High Temple is really welding \u2018pollution.'\u201dI\u2019m begging you, please.Heinrich concluded with a dark face. He was still a young man, but the burdens on his shoulders were too heavy.Akkard answered with a short sigh.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I will surely fulfill my duties.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.Thank you, Lord Akkard.\u201dHeinrich, who was holding his head, smiled with a fond face. During the brief silence, there was a strong bond flowed between the men.\u201cSo, what\u2019s the situation like up there in the north? Huh?\u201dHeinrich asked brightly as if to change the heavy atmosphere.Akkard briefly replied to this,\u201cThis place is completely free from pollution probably because it\u2019s where High Temple is located. Which moron would spray poison in their front yard?\u201d\u201cAs I expected, how about Lessid Ferria, the informant there? Was he as cooperative as promised?\u201dAkkard frowned at the question. Although Lessid was a priest of the High Temple, his real affiliation was the Crown prince\u2019s informant.As a matter of fact, Lessid was doing a good job.

He didn\u2019t know why, but his heart was filled with terrible displeasure.Didn\u2019t it feel like someone trampled on his white bed with muddy shoes?\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Lord Akkard? Are you having problems with Lessid?\u201dHeinrich, who saw Akkad\u2019s chilling expression, also became concerned. He wondered if the two had fought.\u201cNo, nothing, Your Grace.\u201dWhat dirty shoes? Akkard clenched his teeth and shook off useless thoughts.He knew well that he was a selfish boy from birth. His arrogant and selfish heart didn\u2019t have the capacity to love anyone.Damia Primula was nothing special. It was obvious that Damia only let him tasted her, teased him, and burned his hand, flaunting it in front of him as if she were going to give it to him. Had she clung to him like all the other women and coveted pleasure as much, he would have forgotten her without hesitation as soon as the sweet water ran out.Instead, Damia\u2019s naked body grew vivid when he closed his eyes. Akkard\u2019s body heated up when he thought of the texture of her skin, which was wet, moist, and hot from the rain.Because of this, lately, he had been staying up all night. Thinking Damia was lying in his mansion, he couldn\u2019t sleep at all.\u2018Don\u2019t even look good in my dreams and fuck.\u2019By this point, Akkard was beside himself with curiosity.Had he ever glorified a one-night stand before? Was it because it had been a short relationship or\u2026\u2026 If he held her enough times, would his fascination with her body that first night finally deplete?He\u2019d been in anguish waiting for her all this while, and now, finally, Damia Primula arose.The corners of Akkard\u2019s mouth twisted when he thought of her. Tonight, Damia will pay the price for his painful burning heart. It was a comforting thought.\u2018Once you taste it. You\u2019ll get sick of it soon. As always.\u2019Then he wouldn\u2019t be at the mercy of Damia Primula. Afterward, if Lessid confessed or not, he couldn\u2019t be bothered to pay attention.With those thoughts, Akkard felt a little better. Naturally, his report gained more confidence.\u201cLessid is very helpful, as promised. But his younger sister, Louise Ferria\u2026. It seems like she is on the temple\u2019s side. I overheard her by chance in a hallway, so I\u2019m sure.\u201dAkkard briefly reported what he saw and heard in the locker. Except, of course, Damia Primula\u2019s presence.That day, he recalled Damia\u2019s appearance, who couldn\u2019t breathe properly because he was thrusting his penis between her thighs. She had been red to her ears, crying at a loss at what to do and desperate not to make a sound.When he thought of it, blood poured into his groin. No matter, Heinrich didn\u2019t have to know what Damia looked like. Therefore, Akkard omitted Damia\u2019s name from the report.\u201cThat\u2019s unfortunate.\u201dHeinrich, who knew nothing, shrugged.\u201cThe siblings are in different factions with the brother are on our side and his sister on High Temple\u2019s side. Is it the Goddess\u2019 joke?\u201dIt was. No matter how bad a relationship was between siblings, it was rare for them to be this different. Heinrich clicked his tongue but looked at Akkard with pride.\u2018It hasn\u2019t been long since you arrived in the North. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019ve already dug up this much information.\u2019Heinrich was deeply impressed. Akkard did a good job as his right arm. Heinrich, who had been mulling over what he had heard, felt strange and suddenly asked,\u201cBut the one suspected of working with Louise\u2026 is it Cesare Primula? I\u2019ve never heard of him before.\u201dAkkard did not say anything. But Heinrich did not care about his silence. He went on, lost in his thoughts.\u201cI remember because I memorized the genealogy of each family the other day. As far as I know, the head of the Primula had only one daughter. Isn\u2019t it?\u201dAkkard, who seemed to know who it was, frowned. It seemed Damia was destined to be discussed at the end of the day; at least it was just her name.Unfortunately, Heinrich\u2019s words didn\u2019t end there. Suddenly, with an excited look, he leaned forward and asked,\u201cI\u2019ve heard she\u2019s an amazingly beautiful woman. Since it\u2019s reached the capital, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not a lie, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cSir Akkard, do you know who Lady Primula is?\u201dHe knew her well.He knew not only her face but also her body. Akkard smiled darkly when he saw Heinrich showing a strong interest in her.Damia Primula must have been born with a very special talent. A talent that attracts men\u2019s attention, whether she wanted it or not.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Since he\u2019s a child from the second wife\u2019s side, there\u2019s no blood relation.\u201dAkkard didn\u2019t want to uselessly mention Damia so he briefly reported on Cesare.But Heinrich did not give up. Aren\u2019t the interests of young people alike? He slyly smiled and naturally brought up Damia.\u201cReally? Count Primula remarried. The lady suddenly had a big brother. It must have been uncomfortable for her.\u201dUncomfortable, indeed. Akkard had sensed the strange atmosphere between Damia and her stepbrother. But Heinrich, unaware of the dynamic, was simply curious.\u201cSo, have you ever met Lady Primula in person? What do you think?\u201d\u201cIndeed\u2026\u2026She\u2019s beautiful.\u201dAkkard had no choice but to respond to his persistent questions. His strong eyebrow creased slightly, showing that the topic made him uncomfortable.\u201cWhat\u2019s with that expression? Sir Akkard\u2026\u2026 don\u2019t tell me you\u2019ve already touched her?\u201dThis time, there was no answer back. Only then did Heinrich catch on belatedly. The person he was talking to right now was also called the legendary stallion \u2018Ahal Teke\u2019 in capital society.\u201cOh my God, Akkard Valerian!\u201dHis eyes grew big and he laughed.\u201cI have no choice but to respect your skills. How long has it been since you\u2019ve arrived and you\u2019ve already captured the most beautiful woman in the North?\u201dHeinrich expressed his sincere admiration but the compliment only soured Akkard\u2019s mood.\u2018What capture?\u2019It was Akkard who suffered from \u2018hit and run\u2019 from a first-timer, the innocent Damia Primula.Every time he thought about it, his pride was hurt, so his anger exploded and his heart hurt and pounded. But if he leaked out this story even by mistake it was obvious that after a deep laugh Heinrich would bring up the story for the next 10 years.\u2018Damn it I feel like I was played.\u2019Damia Primula was a natural talent in the bed. Thanks to her, Akkard\u2019s head was spinning after years of experience.Thinking of it, Akkard felt a previously unknown sense of defeat. In order to make Damia pay, he needed to finish this report quickly.\u201cI observed Lady Primula\u2019s terrible relationship with her stepbrother, Cesare. So her being on his side, the likelihood\u2026 is extremely low. But I\u2019ll look into it a little more just in case.\u201d\u201cYes, if you stay close to her, you\u2019ll have a chance to approach Cesare, which will naturally make it easier to dig up dirt on the High Temple!\u201dThe capable Sir Akkard, Heinrich nodded with satisfaction. It seemed to him that Akkard had slept with Damia, to gain information.Akkard was grateful that the prince had misunderstood the situation. Akkard quietly shut up. Then Heinrich, feeling hopeful and lively said whatever he wanted.\u201cUse your handsomeness or whatever it is to obtain Lady Primula. For the poor South suffering from pollution. When you\u2019re done, well, you can take her pretty hands and come up to the capital together.\u201dHeinrich smiled gloatingly, revealing his chocolate-stained front teeth. He thought he could hear the royal family\u2019s dignity falling, but Akkard didn\u2019t tell him. It was a petty revenge on Heinrich, who unintentionally reminded him of his broken pride.\u201cThen I\u2019ll see you at the next report, Sir Akkard.\u201dAt last, the magic communication channel was cut off. Akkard put down the magic tool and frowned in thought.\u2018Obtain Damia.\u2019If he could, he wouldn\u2019t really want to. But Damia was a woman who wasn\u2019t interested. She didn\u2019t expect anything from him and she didn\u2019t know anything about him.So she was hard to handle.\u201cTsk.\u201dAkkard clicked his tongue in frustration. At this time, he suddenly felt a presence in the hallway outside the bedroom.\u2018The butler?\u2019Akkard thought casually. He hadn\u2019t slept very well since he came to the North. His surroundings changed, but that wasn\u2019t the only thing bothering him.Just as alpha males had a strong desire to breed in the wild, so did Akkard. His well-disciplined, manly body rapidly grew hot. In the capital women always rushed to his side so it was relatively easy to quench his lust.\u2018Except for that woman.\u2019Akkard mutter to himself in irritation. He was a man with a clear sense of purpose and drive. Therefore, he had no intention of pursuing another woman just because Damia was temporarily uninterested in him. That was the mindset of a loser.But his desire for sex persisted, all the same, so Akkard often lost sleep at night. He had a fit body that grew feverish imagining the fairy-like woman crushed under him.\u2018Poor master. You must be having a hard time sleeping because you are in an unfamiliar bed.\u2019Sebastian, who knew nothing, sympathized with his master. So at night, he would often bring warm milk or herbs and scents for a good night\u2019s sleep.Akkard, who assumed it was Sebastian offering a drink, casually opened the door.But met his eyes was not his butler but Damia.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

With a very complicated look.\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry. I just\u2026 I woke up and the butler said this was your house. I had intended on meeting you and thanking you tomorrow because it was so late\u2026. The butler sent me saying\u2026.\u2019If you say thank you, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll like it\u2019\u2026\u2026.\u201dDamia, who was usually calm and composed, stuttered in embarrassment. It was very unlike her usual self.As soon as he met her shaky blue eyes, Akkard instinctively realized: Damia had overheard some of his conversation with the prince.It wasn\u2019t intentional. And now Damia knew that Akkard also noticed that she had overheard them.\u201c\u2026\u2026I\u2019m so sorry.\u201dNow Akkard understood Damia\u2019s gibberish words and grasped the situation. He growled between his grinding teeth.\u201cDamn it, Sebastian-!!\u201dHe should have corrected the butler\u2019s misunderstanding earlier. But he had been too busy and had left it alone.Sebastian, who misunderstood Damia and Akkard having a special relationship, had been determined to assist his master\u2019s first romance.He had been tending Damia until she got up, washed, and took soup and medicine. But as soon as she recovered to some extent, he urged her out:\u2018Now, why don\u2019t you say good night to my master before you go to bed? What? It\u2019s late? Don\u2019t worry about that! No matter when you visit my lord he\u2019ll welcome it! Definitely! Of course!! Because he\u2019ll be happy.\u201dDamia broke into a cold sweat when he saw Sebastian smiling widely, as he insisted. He was obviously an old butler with a gentle and courteous impression, but she felt an unknown strong pressure.It was almost as if invisible hands had pushed her towards his room.Oops, when she woke up from the pressure, she was already in the hallway. Damia hesitated, glimpsing the darkness that had fallen outside the window. But her escape route had been already tightly blocked by Sebastian.\u201cIf you go up one more floor from here, it\u2019s the master\u2019s room. You can use the stairs that you can see on your right.\u201dSebastian smiled as he gave directions. At this point, she couldn\u2019t return to her room. Damia\u2019s shoulders drooped and walked towards the stairs.\u201dHaaa\u2026\u201dA complicated sigh of resignation escaped Damia\u2019s mouth. She hadn\u2019t remembered what had happened in the wagon because of her fever and passing out.But she knew the situation roughly. Akkard gave her a deep caress, saying he would take off her clothes and warm up her cold body. And after that\u2026\u2018We probably did it. Maybe.\u2019Damia\u2019s face darkened. Even after a few days, when she woke up from the sickbed, her legs were sore. Specifically, the muscles that went up and inside from her thighs that she didn\u2019t usually use. She was sore.To be honest, she didn\u2019t feel good. Last time he had touched her in a locker and now he even approached a sick person. Akkard was truly a selfish prick ruled by his own desires.\u2018Now\u2026\u2026 I can\u2019t get involved with him anymore.\u2019Damia knew herself well. She was serious and intense and Akkard couldn\u2019t be committed, vulnerable, or a serious love interest. It wouldn\u2019t be possible to get to know each other lightly.She was a very burdensome woman.But Akkard was a man who was the opposite of her. So the more she bumped into him the more Damia would be cut and injured\u2014it would be a mess.Between the lighthearted or the sincere-hearted, the sincere-hearted would lose when it came to it in the game of love.\u2018Okay, just go say hello. I have to ask about Cecil anyway.\u2019Akkard may know the identity of the \u201cthings\u201d Louise was trying to feed Cecil. After asking that, she would leave as soon as the sun lit the sky tomorrow.It didn\u2019t matter if Akkard answered as he knew, or if he pretended not to know and concealed information from her. Damia would do everything in her power to protect Cecil.\u2018And when I leave here tomorrow.\u2026..\u2019She would never get involved with the Akkard Valerian again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She knocked on his door like a guest with common sense.No, Damia was going to knock.Then she heard her name pop up.\u201cSo, have you ever met Lady Primula in person? What do you think?\u201dDamia\u2019s hand, just about to knock against Akkard\u2019s room door, froze.Perhaps he already had a guest?No, there wasn\u2019t. Damia saw a bluish light peculiar to the magic communication, flickering through the bedroom door.Akkard must be on a call with someone now.\u2018But why did you mention me?\u2019Curious, Damia hesitated. But it was a mistake.Since then, the revelations she heard from beyond the door were so great that she could never interrupt.\u2018I should have knocked without hesitation,\u2019 Damia regretted.If she missed the timing, she should have turned right around and left. But she hesitated and never left and now the result was being caught red-handed eavesdropping by Akkard.\u201cHow absurd.\u201dAkkard\u2019s cold expression froze her in fear.\u201cI thought I\u2019d brought a sick patient into my mansion, but now I see it was an eavesdropping rat.\u201dDamia blinked.His quiet, unhurried words held a dangerous edge, harsh as Northern winters.Perhaps this was Akkard\u2019s true nature.Most would have been shocked, outraged, or deeply hurt.But Damia wasn\u2019t too stunned.She had the presence of mind to realize Akkard was being defensive since she had overheard such critical and sensitive information.\u201cI understand you are angry. It is warranted.\u201dA calm voice came out of the mouth of the woman he had lashed out at.An irate Akkard was taken aback by her unexpected response and was stunned into silence.Taking advantage of the opportunity, Damia continued,\u201cFirst of all, I want to sincerely apologize. I can\u2019t pretend it didn\u2019t happen but I never meant to spy on your conversation.\u201dDamia\u2019s face, with his head slightly lowered, showed signs of her exhaustion after her days-long illness. Perhaps because of that wariness?Her apology came out with a particularly believable sincerity.Akkard\u2019s heavily frowning brow, slightly loosened.But he couldn\u2019t let her go like this. What she heard was classified matters.Fortunately, it seemed Damia had no intention of just going. Damia, who opened his eyes gently, looked at his eyes. After confirming that Akkad\u2019s anger was somewhat assuaged, she flashed a pure smile, like a young girl.\u201cWell, I\u2019m a little brazen to request this amidst a situation where I eavesdropped on you but\u2026\u2026..,can we have a conversation, if possible?\u201d\u201cConversation? What?\u201dAkkard asked, completely blindsided, while masking his expressions.Inwardly he was trying to get over his embarrassment.Since they met, Damia kept circumventing his expectations.It made Akkard suddenly realize: The fact that he didn\u2019t know anything about \u2018Damia Primula.\u2019He had only been preoccupied with sleeping with her, which had no requirement of getting to know each other seriously in the first place.So he had never wondered about Damia\u2019s personal history. About what her likes and dislikes are, what she\u2019s preoccupied with, and her interpersonal relationships\u2026. all the things that make up the person called Damia Primula.But at this very moment, Akkard was overwhelmed with an intense curiosity, wondering what she was thinking.The first woman to arouse his private curiosity shyly lowered her eyes.\u201cI thought I could help you with your plan.\u201dHer red lips, as if they had been stained with wine, continued to move, declaring that he would not regret it.Akkard blinked, finally overcoming an enchanting temptation that even a stoic king would fall to.\u201c\u2026\u2026Okay, I\u2019ll hear you out.\u201dHe uncrossed his arms and nodded inward. Damia, who was taking steps without much thought, suddenly became conscious of their attire.She was now only dressed in a robe over a pajama chemise.With his long hair down, she suddenly became nervous to enter his personal space. Damia\u2019s shoulder cowered a little as she passed by in front of him.She could feel it even if she didn\u2019t see it. Akkard\u2019s sharp gaze grazed the side of her face to the back of her neck and eventually down her back.Damia swallowed her saliva quietly.She felt like she was being observed by a beast, so her backbone was crushed.Maybe she was making a big mistake right now.The fact that she overheard Akkard, and was about to make a life-altering proposal to him.\u2018Still, I don\u2019t know without trying.\u2019The moment Damia heard the name of Cesare from Akkard\u2019s conversation, her mind flashed.Damia immediately realized what her next move was.\u2018There is a saying that the enemy of the enemy is a friend.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She would do anything to get him out of her life and out of the county.Even if that meant holding hands with Akkard Valerian.Akkard carefully studied Damia. Her eyes were rational, her face a bit pale but with a sense of stability.In short, she didn\u2019t seem like a liar.\u201cI\u2019ve lived in the North all my life, and my family supplies the goods they need for the Great Temple and Holy War. So I can\u2019t openly oppose the temple but if you can guarantee secrecy, I can supply you with a little help and information.\u201dDamia\u2019s suggestion was very tempting. The biggest obstacle to Akkard now was the unfamiliar social environment of the North.The impenetrable northern nobility were deeply dazzled by the capital\u2019s foremost celebrity and listened intently to his dramatic stories of capital society and the progress of the \u2018pollution\u2019 in the south.However, when Akkard tried to ask something, people avoided answering or explaining anything and backed away.\u2018Especially when it comes to information about the Great Temple.\u2019The reverence and loyalty of the northern people to the temple were beyond Akkard\u2019s imagination.If Crown Prince Heinrich had witnessed what Akkard had seen, he would have had a heart attack.It had been pure dumb luck that he had overheard Louise\u2019s conversation while hiding in a locker. There was no guarantee of such good luck assisting him in the future.\u2018I\u2019m sure Damia will be of great help.\u2019Akkard looked at the woman in front of him with new eyes.Her rich hair, white face, blue eyes, and red lips were glamorous even without makeup.Even with the misfitting shawl and guest pajamas, her shoulders and collarbones looked elegant.A beautiful woman. A woman whom he wanted to sleep with. Those had been the only things Akkard had thought about Damia beforehand.So somehow this situation was unfamiliar.It was almost as if he were now facing a woman he had never known before.\u201cOkay, I understand what you mean.\u201dAkkad deliberately and slowly affirmed. He always trusted his intuition but this time it wasn\u2019t easy for him to decide.He wasn\u2019t flippant, so Akkard asked questions typical of those who agonize over serious decisions.\u201cBut why do you want to help me?\u201dAkkard asked a natural question.As she disclosed, Count Primula\u2019s estate has long traded with the temple.No matter how confidentially was guaranteed, Damia\u2019s assistance would clearly jeopardize her house, and no matter how \u2018small\u2019 her help was it would be clearly a significant betrayal to the Great Temple.Damia grew quiet at his sharp question. And laughed, embarrassed.Her face resembled a lost man. Akkard thought perhaps she didn\u2019t have a right answer.After a moment Damia spoke, tilting her head and lowering her eyelashes, attempting to hide her vulnerable face.She was clearly being honest, feeling exposed.\u201cI want to destroy \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 Cesare.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t just a conflict between stepbrother and stepsister anymore. In comparison, it was rather cute that Cesare manipulated her first love, Kael, into breaking her heart and breaking them up. Compared to what Cesare intends to do afterward.The moment he sneaked into her bedroom, Damia knew.The moment has already passed to maintain a decent relationship with Cesare.\u2018Besides he\u2019s even going so far as to touch Cecil.\u2019Damia\u2019s eyes grew cold and dark.From her point of view, he was an enemy of the Primula family and to its heir apparent, even though Cesare was adopted.Where did he get such insolence to dare to commit such atrocities?Damia had always wondered about that. Cesare wasn\u2019t impulsive because her father, Count Primula, was away.Cesare was too cunning for that.So she speculated Cesare had a backer. And what if his backer was the temple?\u2018Then in the Great Temple has already betrayed me, they have chosen Cesare over me,\u2019Damia deduced realistically.The Great Temple had more than enough power to replace the successor of a count. And Damia wasn\u2019t good or passive enough to allow herself to be pushed out of her seat like this.Even if the Primula family\u2019s business is smooth thanks to the Great Temple, what good was it? If she was ousted from her successor position due to a conspiracy, it would be over.\u201c\u2026You want to destroy\u2026\u2026 Your stepbrother?\u201dasked Akkad, in a tone of astonishment upon hearing her answer.Alarmed Damia, who looked up reflexively, checked his countenance.It was a very bizarre sight. To an outsider, Akkard looked like an indignant man baring his teeth. But in Damia\u2019s eyes, it looked like he was smiling.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Then there was Damia who volunteered to join hands with him to destroy Cesare, her step-brother.These dynamics were extremely interesting to him.Akkard\u2019s thoughts naturally lead to thinking of his own bond with his sister Sienna, who was now in the royal palace in the capital.And then he thought of the warning she divulged in his dreams.\u2018Keep this in mind\u2014I\u2019m telling you this because you\u2019re such a fool\u2014If you don\u2019t get rid of your trashy lifestyle right away, you\u2019ll regret it forever.\u2019Why did he have that dream?Akkard shrugged his shoulders and dismissed it as a meaningless dream. Moving on, he asked Damia,\u201cBut why do you want to destroy Cesare? I\u2019m curious.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Do I have to answer that?\u201dDamia asked back with a pale face.Akkard saw her slender fingers tremble a little, like a frail white birch swaying in the cold winter wind.An ordinary gentleman would have stopped interrogating Damia at this point, but Akkard was a far cry from a gentleman.Rather, he felt a strong interest and mischievous curiosity when Damia showed a rare glimpse at her vulnerability.\u201cYes, I need to know why you want to help,\u201dhe pried as if he were pushing his claws into a cornered prey.Then, the tremors that started from Damia\u2019s fingertips spread to her shoulders.\u2018There must be other situations and dynamics that I\u2019m not aware of,\u2019Akkard smirked, the woman he was anxious to sleep with was shaking because of another guy\u2014which was very annoying, but on the other hand, he was quite pleased that Damia wanted to destroy him.Akkard, who concealed his evil intentions, poured wine he had in his bedroom out in glasses. Then he held Damia\u2019s shaking hand and gave her the cup.\u201cCome on, let\u2019s have a drink first and then talk.\u201d\u201c\u2026thank you.\u201d\u2019Damia, whose head was full of Cesare, accepted it and took a sip. She needed something to calm her mind.It must have been wine from the south because the sweetness that spread in her mouth was strong and fragrant.Her weakened body that just woke up from a sickbed seat quickly got intoxicated. Armed with drunken courage, Damia slowly opened her mouth, her cheeks already hot.\u201cA few days ago, in the middle of the night when no one was around, Cesare broke into my bedroom.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dAt her shocking admission, Akkard rose halfway from his seat.In his heart, he looked down on Cesare. He was a weak snake looming around Damia and swallowing his thirst, unable to do anything as he watched her.But how dare he sneak into Damia\u2019s bedroom! Rage surged from the depths of his chest. Akkard\u2019s manly chin grew rigid.\u201cOye, nothing happened\u2013Really!\u201dadded Damia, who misunderstood Akkard\u2019s response.She was afraid that her reputation and the honor of Count Primula would plummet.\u201cCesare just threatened me a little.\u201d\u201cHe threatened you? What did he say?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t get in his way and, um\u2026\u2026.\u201dHer lips trembled. She couldn\u2019t bear to repeat Cesare\u2019s words and looked at Akkard.Akkard wanted to grab her by the shoulders and force her to speak quickly.But he also needed time to calm down now.So instead of persuading her, Akkard clenched his teeth and poured more wine into her glass.Damia didn\u2019t reject his offer either. She kept shaking and short of breath when she thought of that night.The horror and panic of being strangled by a bigger, stronger man than her in a locked bedroom late at night. The overwhelming sense of helplessness and despair that no matter what cruel thing he decided to do to her she would not be able to resist.When she recalled all of this her mind seemed so depleted.Damia hurriedly downed the glass of wine, as if to wash away the memory and barely managed to answer Akkard\u2019s question.\u201cHe, Cesare\u2026\u2026..uh, warned me. Stay away from Lord Akkard.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

No matter how cunning and accomplished Cesare was, he could not even measure up to Akkard\u2019s feet. But now he dared to threaten the woman he coveted.It was so outrageous\u2014like a crazy hyena scratching a sleeping lion\u2019s nose. Akkard was not the type to tolerate those that insulted his domain. If he could, he would grab Cesare right away and skin him alive.It was a familiar feeling as if his stomach was boiling and his vision turned dark red.\u2018Don\u2019t touch Miss Damia,\u2019said that cheeky Lessid Ferira.\u2018I\u2019m going to confess to her when I\u2019m done with this job.\u2019\u2018This bastard and that bastard\u2014all looking at her.\u2019He fell into a nasty mood but he had no clue why\u2014 so his heart ached even more.\u201cAh, Lord Akkard?\u201dDamia was stunned by his fierce anger. She looked embarrassed not knowing why Akkard was so furious.\u201cDon\u2019t mind me. I was just angry for a moment,\u201dAkkard mumbled unclearly.Damia didn\u2019t seem particularly relieved or convinced at his answer, but she didn\u2019t bother to pursue it.Instead, she looked up at the Akkard with anxious eyes.Akkard saw this and clicked his tongue. Her eyes, which usually looked confident and certain, now looked droopy and cute as a puppy.She looked uniquely lovely in soft pajamas while holding a wine glass with both of her hands.\u2018Cause she\u2019s so pretty, she\u2019s going to be shivering from men coming at her from all directions.\u2019Akkard grabbed a bottle of wine and gulped it down. The warmth of the drink went down his throat, warming up his stomach. Then, it seemed to clear up that stuffy feeling he felt.Maybe the reason why he felt so horrible\u2014yes. It\u2019s probably that. Because other guys were drooling on his prey.Maybe that\u2019s why? For the first time, Akkard felt a sense of crisis. Anxiety that someone might steal his prey. Taking the game that he always took for granted. An unfamiliar apprehension of \u2018maybe she will be taken away.\u2019\u2018I\u2019ll never let that happen even if I die.\u2019His arrogant pride even pierced the heavens, making them growl at his conceit.He wouldn\u2019t allow any blemish on his own perfection.For the first time, Akkard was inclined to indulge a woman\u2019s wishes.He had only known to gently lower his body, always pushing down on women and nothing on his mind but to have them. Akkard met Damia\u2019s eyes and asked,\u201cAre you cold? You\u2019re shaking.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s just \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201dShe was frightened when she thought about that day. To the point, she felt as if she couldn\u2019t breathe.Damia gulped down the words that had threatened to fall out of her lips. She wasn\u2019t close enough to Akkard to confide her difficulties with him.But Akkard instinctively seized the opportunity. In front of him Damia was quite susceptible. The quaking of her unstable gaze, her tight grip, making her knuckles white communicated instead of words. She was very tired right now.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. You\u2019ll be fine.\u201dDamia looked up in surprise. It couldn\u2019t be, but Akkard\u2019s words seemed to discern her thoughts.As their eyes met, Akkard smiled, bending his purple eyes surrounded by white eyelashes. Then he whispered in a low voice that melted her ears.\u201cNo one can harm you. I won\u2019t let them.\u201dIt was too sweet. Even though Damia knew it, it was comforting like stress-indulging in chocolate, it wouldn\u2019t change anything but it made her feel good.\u2018But \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u2019After all, Damia was human. She was still young and inexperienced. She lost her mother when she was young and had grown up fast to reassure her father, who was often away from home.It wasn\u2019t that she didn\u2019t hate this desperation for reassurance she felt. But sometimes one needed a place to lean on.Damia looked down at Akkard\u2019s hand that held hers. His body temperature transferred to her, acting as a bridge to her lonely and cold heart and warming her. At least for this moment, he seemed to say that she was not alone and he would hold her tight.Maybe that\u2019s why it didn\u2019t occur to her to push him away.Just as Akkard wanted to embrace her out of pleasure, she also wanted to be comforted. Even if it\u2019s as brief as a hand warmer in the middle of winter.Slip-Damia\u2019s hand and body relaxed in his grasp. As Akkard felt this, he raised both ends of his lips and smiled.\u201cCome here.\u201dHe finally captured her.Deep down in his heart, lurking in the depths of his chest, the beast growled with satisfaction.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even when it was thrusting and stabbing violently inside her, her body jostled so wildly, making her dizzy.\u201cSo, ah! Deep, slowly \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201dShe moaned \u2018slowly.\u2019Akkard bit his molars so tightly that his jaw quickly grew sore.Having a taste of Damia was no different from feeding a beast on the verge of starving to death. He couldn\u2019t resist gluttonously wolfing it down.Ahh, the body he patiently clutched and held onto was sweet. Akkard grabbed her slender waist tighter. And stuck her from behind her enchanting ass, digging in as if he could put both balls in.\u201cOh! Ah, ah! Ah!\u201dDamia sobbed, shaking wildly while clutching the sheets.The pleasure was so strong that she felt like she was going to die. Because of this, the two legs that were propping her on the floor eventually lost strength.Just as her body was about to slide down, Akkard pulled her up onto the bed. And sat her down on the bed comfortably.Of course, it wasn\u2019t for Damia. He immediately spread her legs wide, then climbed on and pressed down to insert his cock. He could push it much deeper than in the previous unstable position.\u201cAhhh!\u201dHer two white legs convulsed by the excessively intense deep insertion. Her entrance was trembling and she felt embarrassed. But Akkard\u2019s thick torso was sandwiched between her legs, so there was no way to close them.\u201cSpread your legs wider. Otherwise, I can tie you up and hit it.\u201dDamia shivered at the dreadful warning.Taking advantage of her being caught unawares, he clasped Damia\u2019s asscheeks with his big hands, lifted her up, and began to shake and thurst his back in again.A dark red penis moved in back and forth between the legs, spread out wider than before.This time, he managed to fit in even the thickest root of his cock. As her inner walls were stimulated to her core\u2019s end, Damia shed tears and cried:\u201cAh, Oh, Oooohhh!!!\u201dDamia\u2019s body shook up and down. Her narrow insides were filled with him, and it felt like she was going to explode. But rather than disliking the sensation, it was thrilling enough to melt her mind.His hot genitals that crammed in her insides rubbed and mashed into every inch of her sensitive areas. Akkard bent down and bit Damia\u2019s neck as he gave her a heavy thrust. Just as a mating beast marks its female.\u201c*Gasp*, unngh\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7!!!\u201dA soft cry vibrated under the skin of the neck that hosted the bite.Akkard gently and lovingly licked the bite imprint.He bit her collarbone, as his lower body was ferociously digging into her narrow hole. Not knowing what to do during the overwhelming stimulus Damia clung to him and wept.\u201cShhh,\u201dAkkard soothed her with only his lips. Then he began to stimulate her walls faster and more violently.Whenever his thick and hot member poked up and flexed, it felt like her head was becoming weird.\u201cNo, ah! Please, uh! Slowly \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201dThe frightened Damia embraced his neck. Akkard paused. It was the first time her arm had squeezed him to herself.When he looked down, he could see her red eyes and her flushed nose.Her usually elegant white face was nowhere to be seen and instead bloomed red as a flower, her expression lewd and disorganized. It was a really sexy face just to look at.It was when Akkard was looking down with bated breath, holding his breath\u2014stunned. Damia, who seemed to be overwhelmed, her long eyelashes trembled.Then the clear water, which had formed in the corners of her wet eyes, fell down her soft cheeks.\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7[I\u2019m going] crazy.\u201dThe last strand of reason in his head snapped.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

And he started shaking his back frantically.It was a rough movement that made her feel like she was being devoured.His genitals digging inside her ran wild enough that she could not keep up.Faster and faster it slipped through Damia\u2019s pussy. A violent and strong climax rapidly engulfed her.\u201cAhhhhh aaahhhhh!\u201dAt the same time Damia felt as if she was floating, Akkard\u2019s cock acutely kneaded against her contracting inner walls\u2014and felt more and more vivid.It was hot. It was so hot that she felt as if her body was about to melt. Her climax hadn\u2019t even subsided yet, but his organ was even more excited and swelled up even larger inside.\u201cNo, no, ah! Ohhhh!!\u201dThe pleasure was too much and it was poisonous. Akkard, who had not yet reached his peak, pushed relentlessly into her convulsing hole. His nerves seemed to burn every time he fucked her sensitive inner walls and pulled out.\u201cAh. Damia\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201dAkkard, who had this in mind, groaned lowly.It was obscene how much her wet hole was tightening and pulling on his cock.Her hot trembling core surrounded his penis and tightened around him with terrible pleasure\u2014making him feel dizzy. It was a hellish pleasure.Wouldn\u2019t it be great if he always chewed and swallowed [t1v: aka fuck] like this? If only he could hide her deep in his stomach so that the others wouldn\u2019t see her, take her out whenever he wanted to and hit it roughly.Akkard bit her round shoulder gently, with a strong desire to monopolise her.Red spots one by one filled her white-snow-like skin. He was proud to see his traces on her small body. Akkard was not particularly fond of leaving traces on women\u2019s bodies. But Damia\u2019s case was a bit special.Just like you want to wrinkle up when you see a well-ironed sheet, and you want to scribble on something when you see a clean drawing paper. Damia Primula was like that for him. Damia pushed his lips with her hands because of the brutality of constantly putting teeth on her tender skin.\u201cNo, don\u2019t bite it, it hurts,\u201dher lips whispering \u201cit hurts\u201d glistened with tears.It was as beautiful and exquisite as if it had honey on it.For the first time, Akkard thought he wanted to kiss a woman.No, only was he thinking, he was anxious.He wanted to greedily suck that sweet-looking piece of flesh right now.But instead, slender fingers pushed his mouth away, annoying him.\u201cGet your hands off me, Damia.\u201dBefore I really tie you up.It was a hot and bloody warning.He grabbed Damia\u2019s thin wrist with his big hand, not just using his words, and pinned her hands on the sheet so that it wouldn\u2019t disturb him.\u201cAh!\u201dA surprised Damia looked up at him with anxious eyes.Her thick lips were half-open, revealing a ripe and wet hole and seducing him.Akkard was willing to succumb to the temptation.\u201cUnn!\u201dIt was a harsh, rough kiss that penetrated and dug into her mouth.His tongue, which had persistently sucked on her lips now invaded her mouth. Then, he sucked in her little tongue and began to drive through her mouth.At the same time, his hot cock pried and grew in her core. He bit her with his lips and poked her lower mouth, as she melted sweetly.\u201cAh ah! Oh, wait \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201dA large pillar-like object came in and out, tightly filling up her soaking wet passage. The insertion, which was as heavy and thick, aroused a powerful sense of pleasure.Both the upper and lower holes were plugged up by Akkard, making her feel helpless. Several climaxes overtook her, her vision going blank.Her weak legs couldn\u2019t handle any more pleasure and squirmed.But Akkard grabbed her legs and pushed his own deeper, spreading her legs wider.\u201cAhhhh!!\u201dShe didn\u2019t want to feel it anymore. It felt like strong was wrong with her body\u2014it became hot and sensitive and she saw flashes of light every time he penetrated her.Damia cried and begged for the joy that went beyond her limits. But all the sounds were eaten into the mouth of an insatiable predator.\u201cDon\u2019t be a crybaby.\u201dBecause it\u2019s a long night.Akkard smiled and licked his sensual lips, and broke into laughter.His beautiful face coupled with his hard upper body was all sweaty and shiny\u2014was overwhelming.Nevertheless, he looked very lively.Of course, he had to be.Because the hungry beast finally got the food it wanted.It wasn\u2019t an illusion.Sex with Damia Primula was special. The least he could say was, it was really damn good. It\u2019s a common saying, but it was bloody good enough to beg for.Once he knew the taste, he couldn\u2019t endure it anymore. By tomorrow, he was going to eat his full so much so that Damia wouldn\u2019t be able to walk.\u2018That way, you won\u2019t be able to escape.\u2019Akkard\u2019s purple eyes glistened with obsession.He used to regret it every night. On the first night of embracing Damia, he had ended their affair with moderation to be considerate.Now he couldn\u2019t let her turn her back first again. And if he saw her say goodbye and leave the bedroom, he would definitely go crazy.He didn\u2019t want to know what this feeling actually was. Perhaps his wicked temper was triggered again on a whim\u2014and he figured it so. Unfortunately for Damia, he was a man of selfishness and the ability to execute his intentions.\u201cYou\u2019re mine.\u201dAt least as long as I want you.Akkard, who grabbed her, whispered softly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Anxiety filled his heart and shook him up with an unknown tension waking him wide awake. As soon as he sat up his body turned with a mind of its own and searched his bedside next to him. And here was \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u2018She\u2019s here.\u2019A pale beauty fell asleep with her red hair enveloping her. Perhaps because she underwent a lot last night, her eyes looked like they were tightly closed and wouldn\u2019t open anytime soon.Akkard let out a deep breath of relief he didn\u2019t know he was holding.He was deeply relieved to confirm that Damia had not yet left. She was sleeping as if she were dead. No matter how much she had cried, prayed, and pleaded last night, it had been worthwhile to squeeze out every last drop of stamina.Only then did he regain his composure and sweep back his platinum blonde hair with his thick forearms.Then\u2014it suddenly occurred to him that he had just experienced an intense sense of relief\u2014why?\u2018Why am I feeling this way?\u2019Of course, it was a shocking experience for him to be a \u2018hit and run\u2019 encounter for Damia. It was apparent that the same thing happened one more time, it would wreck his lofty pride.But that didn\u2019t mean he had to be so distressed. If she ran away, it\u2019s enough to catch her again, and if she didn\u2019t like him, it was enough to hold her next to his side until she liked him.There was no woman who didn\u2019t beg him for love. No matter how much people professed to value silk, learning, and culture, humans were still a part of the animal kingdom. It was their instinct to gravitate towards stronger and superior males.So she would be like that, too.Akkard laid down on his side, bending his arm at his elbow and propping his head up on his hand as he studied Damia\u2019s sleeping face.He followed her lines trailing down from her round forehead to her elegant nose bridge and down her very lovely plump lips.Akkard used to think she looked like a very luxurious siren. But as he gazed upon her sleeping face she looked like an adorable, innocent young girl.\u201cHmm.\u201dAs he stared at the beauty donning only a sheet, his lower physique began to grow stiff and erect again. It was even a familiar phenomenon for an athletic man with a high- libido such as himself.Usually, he would have woken up the woman to relieve his own desires without reluctance. But strangely enough, he didn\u2019t want to wake Damia up.He enjoyed burying and slamming his cock deep inside her, but now he just wanted to lie down like this\u2026\u2026.. he wanted to watch her sleeping peacefully.\u2018Am I getting old already?\u2019He wasn\u2019t that old yet.Akkard frowned and considered his shifts strange. He was occupied and perturbed by his unusual sentiments when Damia\u2019s dark red eyelashes began to tremble.\u201cUmm,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201dAkkard held his breath and watched her wake up.Red-like flowering eyelashes trembled, and the glossy smooth eyelids slowly rolled up, revealing her eyes\u2026..Her gaze contained the world.Only then did Akkard realize: his life before this moment had been dismally colorless. It had been numb, shadowy, and bleak\u2014he had felt alone, frozen in time.But the moment Damia opened his eyes, the world suddenly regained all colors. Suddenly time and air moved with a vibrancy; swirling around with vitality.It felt positively extraordinary.If he were asked to divide the day in half, it would be divided into before and after Damia woke up, not in the morning and evening or by the sun and moon.\u2018What is going on\u2026..?\u2019What is this feeling? What the hell is wrong with me?Akkard\u2019s purple eyes trembled with this foreign shock.At the same time, Damia had been rubbing her half-open eyes and just found him.\u201cOh,\u201dshe moaned with her lips slightly open.Akkard bit his lips because he couldn\u2019t understand what that meant. What do you mean by \u201cOh\u201d? It was a very short expression, but it was also a word that could be interpreted in 50,000 ways. [t1v: oh fuck he\u2019s fallen hard if he is already angsty overanalyzing]Was she lamenting over what happened last night?Damia had made no secret of her intention not to be sexually involved with him anymore. He was strangely anxious contemplating that she may have been intoxicated on wine and the seductive atmosphere last night and thought she made a \u201cmistake.\u201dAkkard studied her face without blinking, trying to find an indication of regret that may have leaked out.However, Damia\u2019s reaction was unexpected.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, Damia did not mind his reaction, assuming he was dazed upon waking up in the morning.\u2018He probably approached me for work.\u2019Damia remembered Akkard\u2019s conversation she overheard via the communication channel. With whom she presumed to be the crown prince, had told Akkard,\u201cIf you stay close to her, you\u2019ll have a chance to approach Cesare. Naturally, it would be easier to investigate the Great Temple!\u201dIt was only then that Damia finally understood why Akkard, who had nothing lacking, would pursue her.At first, she thought it had just been a desire to play with fire or lust. She reckoned it was dangerous to be woven with such feelings, so Damia had kept pushing Akkard away.But it turned out that this was a part of his operation. Damia was Cesare\u2019s step-sister nonetheless and the object of his obsession. Standing by her side was bound to increase his success in capturing Cesare.\u2018So that\u2019s why Lord Akkard had chased me around.\u2019Otherwise, if not, why would he follow a boring and inexperienced woman like herself?Damia swallowed a bitter smile, convinced.Ironically, her low self-esteem protected her heart from Akkard. When she thought he was having sex with her for work, she even felt relieved.\u2018Maybe this kind of relationship is not bad either.\u2019Akkard and herself had the same goal. In that regard, Damia hoped their relationship would change in the future.Now she understood his \u2018real\u2019 purpose. Therefore, Akkard would not push her too hard as before. She is now a partner pursuing a common goal, rather than prey for Akkard to target.In the meanwhile, it would not be bad for Akkard, who likes sex, to get a little pleasure, and for herself to be comforted by his body heat.\u2018Anyway, it\u2019s a short-term relationship.\u2019After his mission was complete Akkard would return to his southern estate and the capital. So there was nothing to lose in this exchange. Those were Damia\u2019s insights.Naturally, she was completely unaware of Akkard\u2019s heart starting to pound loudly against his chest and his mouth going dry. Rather, when piecing her rationale together she felt relieved.Motivated, she set her sights on her next objective. Damia, who wrapped the sheet around her body, spoke awkwardly.\u201cUm, this may be a little brazen for a guest to bring up,\u201dshe smiled brightly like a flower at the still dazed Akkard.\u201cCan I get some breakfast?\u201d [t1v: ha! Priorities]***They were eating. All major events had to start after filling the stomach.Damia began to eagerly savor the well-prepared breakfast in front of them.She wasn\u2019t usually a glutton but she couldn\u2019t put down her tableware. Soup full of cream and potatoes, well-baked bread, fresh butter, eggs, and bacon. Even though it was a regular meal she had had often, it seemed to have a particularly savory taste.Perhaps Damia was so hungry because she had used up too much energy last night.\u201cEat slowly,\u201dadvised Akkard briefly, while he pushed a cup of black tea with milk towards her.Damia looked into his eyes to thank him. Yet the moment they made eye contact, Akkard had quickly turned his head and avoided her gaze.\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7?\u201dWas it just me? Damia tilted her head and put down the bread. She was now somewhat full, it was time to bring up the questions that she had been wondering about.\u201cSir Akkard.\u201dAkkard, whose name was called, looked at her, but it hadn\u2019t been a straight forward look into her eyes as he had done in the past.Damia imagined his eyes wandering somewhere in the middle of her eyes and cheeks\u2014a very subtle change.However, she had no authority to force his gaze elsewhere and decided to continue with her original purpose.\u201cNow that we\u2019re on the same boat, can I ask you frankly?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dAkkard asked with a countenance that no longer contained the sharp vigilance he had before.Damia was relieved. It was a good sign.\u201cThat day, we overheard a conversation in the locker. Do you happen to know what \u201cthing\u201d Louise was referring to?\u201dDamia asked seriously as she leaned forward, asked seriously.The day when Cecil\u2014 her most precious friend\u2014 was scheduled to drink tea with Louise Perria, was just around the corner.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What do you mean by \u2018thing\u2019?\u201dAkkard inquired, raising one eyebrow as if he was taken aback.Damia nodded with perplexed eyes.\u201cYes. I had only overheard a tiny bit.\u201dDamia then wondered why she had thought Akkard would know about the item Louise had talked about.Akkard\u2019s brow furrowed when he heard her answer. He remained silent for a while as if he were in a difficult situation, and then surprisingly explained further.\u201cThey were referring to a kind of drug that causes mental illness.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026What? Drugs?\u201dDamia asked, feeling like her throat was closing up. Herbs and ingredients for many drugs usually grew a lot in hot areas. Therefore, they were unfamiliar to those who lived in the cold, conservative, and barren north like Damia.\u201cI guess you don\u2019t know. It\u2019s a product that secretly has been circulating among the southern nobles recently, but I haven\u2019t heard about it being in the north.\u201dAs expected, the news was late to arrive here because the north was a remote place.Akkard clicked his tongue against his teeth in displeasure and put down the tableware in his hand. He added a brief explanation, And for the alarmed Damia.\u201cCompared to more commonplace drugs, this one is much more addictive and works quicker. It breaks down the mind, makes people anxious, and renders them unable to discern reality from hallucinations.\u201d\u201cOh my God! Why would people take such drugs?\u201dDamia was confused by the purpose of such unfamiliar narcotics.Her heart sank numbly upon contemplating Cecil might eat such a thing.Upon glimpsing Damia\u2019s feeble trembling fingertips, Akkard softened his tone.\u201cThe purpose is simple. After you\u2019ve broken the mind with drugs you can make them a desperate customer that clings to the supplier. That way, you can control people as you please.\u201dThere was a faint sense of resentment in Akkard\u2019s explanation. He had witnessed several people struggling with their drug addiction in the south.In the midst of the high, they had been full of confidence, morale and so they had looked more attractive.But it made them burn brightly before their flame was exhausted and the night consumed them.Having depleted their energy with drugs, they became frightened beasts. Illusions, hallucinations, and lifeless nightmares rushed in and ate away their reason. He witnessed people succumbing to endless seizures, panic attacks, crippling them and ruining any hope for a stable life.These were common symptoms of withdrawal, one couldn\u2019t even spend their day properly, only seeking the next hit. The only way to overcome these horrible symptoms was to take more drugs. So they did anything to get the medicine.Akkard knew of a man willing to sell his wife and daughter, and even his last dignity left as a human being in exchange for only a handful of narcotics.\u2018It\u2019s repulsive.\u2019From the \u2018pollution\u2019 to a growing drug epidemic. The current situation in the south was an increasingly unrelenting hellhole.Akkard\u2019s eyes clouded over.It struck him as suspicious. Just as many pro-temple aristocrats followed the High Temple in the north, there were usually many pro-king aristocrats who followed the royal family in the south.However, why are so many disasters concentrated only in the southern part of the country, which can be said to be the home of the pro-king faction?It was as if\u2026\u2026.. it was an elaborate plan to dismantle the supporting party of the royal family step by step.\u201cHow complicated,\u201dDamia muttered, shaken.She also had so many mysteries to solve. How Cesare got his hands on drugs this far north. And why would they want to feed it to Cecil?Fortunately, she now had a partner to solve these dilemmas together.\u201cWhat does Cecil Evergreen have?\u201dAkkard clenched his chin after he asked.Damia replied, stuttering as she tried to organize her racing thoughts.\u201cWell\u2026 um, the\u2026 Cecil\u2019s family\u2026 transports the mineral trade. It\u2019s a distribution business that transports minerals mined from northern mines to the capital.\u201d\u201cSo they work in the water transportation distribution network,\u201dAkkard mumbled his conclusion.In the northern parts, where there was barren farmland, instead, there were mines where precious metals and iron ore could be dug up.The north\u2019s geography was a hostile, rocky, mountainous area. The metals mined were extremely heavy.It was not easy to distribute them beyond the treacherous mountains to distant capitals.One of the few families that managed to do this stably was Cecil\u2019s family, Marquis Evergreen.\u201cPerhaps there are things they need to transport from the High Temple to the capital or vice versa.\u201dSecretly.A cold smile spread over Akkard\u2019s face.***Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She packed her luggage, preparing to go back home. Since she came unplanned she didn\u2019t have much to pack.\u201cAre you really departing now?\u201dasked Sebastian as the restless butler watched Damia.Damia replied with a smile.\u201cOf course. The carriage has also been repaired, so we have to go back quickly before sunset.\u201d\u201cStill\u2026\u2026. you\u2019re a valued guest, so why don\u2019t you have lunch?\u201dSebastian, who was regretful, was clingy. After so much time, patience, and effort, the young master\u2014no, master, had fallen in love for the first time, so he felt he couldn\u2019t let her go like this.Perhaps if Akkard\u2019s partner, Lessid, had witnessed this, he would have been stunned.He had been in and out of Akkard\u2019s residence a few times because of his status as a spy but had never been enthusiastically served by Sebastian.Damia, who had no inkling of Sebastian\u2019s favor, shook her head.\u201cOh, I ate too much breakfast, and I\u2019m still full.\u201dShe wasn\u2019t an angel smiling, saying thank you for caring. But it would be lacking to say she was pretty and had a good personality.She was a lady chosen by his picky owner.Sebastian focused and glanced at Damia.Even him, who had worked in the decadent and lavish high society in the capital for a long time had to admit she was a beauty worthy of praise.In particular, Damia\u2019s red hair hearkened to the rising sun. In the grey north, her bright hair was very lively.Sebastian, who had been studying her, opened his mouth impulsively.\u201cMay I ask you a rude question?\u201d\u201cUmm? What kind of question is it?\u201d\u201cAre you of pure northern descent, my lady?\u201dWhat did he mean? Damia blinked at the sudden question. Seeing her bewildered face, Sebastian quickly explained,\u201cI\u2019m sorry. It is rare for a northern nobleman to have such beautiful hair\u2026..\u201dDamia, who finally understood Sebastian\u2019s question, stroked her hair and answered demurely,\u201cWell\u2026.my late mother was from the South.\u201d\u201cOh, dear.\u201dSebastian let out a short sigh with a grim face. Embarrassed, he had unintentionally brought up Damia\u2019s painful family history.Naturally, he couldn\u2019t deter Damia from leaving anymore and could only follow her from behind.\u201cThen I\u2019ll get going.\u201dDamia, who was ready to leave, glanced back.Sebastian\u2019s disappointed expression when he saw her off to the front door was a little sad, but she couldn\u2019t help it. It was impossible to not return home.\u2018I have little to do with Sir Akkard in the first place.\u2019Damia thought brightly. Akkard had evolved from a \u2018one night\u2019s fling\u2019 to \u2018sex partner for the time being.\u2019 However, there was no significant relationship between the two.Damia was not a fool. Would she be special to a naughty and arrogant playboy whose rumours and drama even reached the north?She never had such expectations or questions\u2014it would be tantamount to torturing oneself.\u2018But thanks to our close physical relationship, I was lucky to be able to join hands with him.\u2019It would have been quite burdensome to deal with Cesare alone, especially with the Temple backing him up. She would have been no match. Damia had always been used to being alone since she had lost her mother. However, she was relieved that she gained an unexpected ally.Was it because of that? For now, Damia thought she could pretend to be ignorant of the mean and selfish things Akkard had done. It wasn\u2019t because he had looked down on her anyway but rather he had kept approaching her because of \u2018work.\u2019Damia, whose heart was naturally generous, decided to forgive him even if he didn\u2019t come to see her off. Perhaps, now that she was involved there was a lot to think about. Possibly he was reporting to the crown prince right now.\u201cThank you, Sebastian. If possible, I hope to see you again next time.\u201dDamia, whose heart grew even more generous, waved to Sebastian for the last time and hopped on the wagon.\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dShe looked back, unnerved, as she tried to sit down.Eerily, she felt a strong gaze that pierced the back of her head. But all Damia could see was Sebastian\u2019s disappointed expression.\u2018Was it because of your forlornness?\u2019Damia tilted her head and settled in the carriage. The coachman started their journey as the well-mended wheels rolled.Watching Damia\u2019s carriage disappear in the distance, Sebastian\u2019s shoulders slumped. Then he turned around and something pulled his eyes up.With a clear view, on the elegant balcony on the third floor, was his dishonest owner.\u201cTh\u2014 that gaze.\u201dAkkard\u2019s eyes that lingered on her disappearing figure were violently boiling. It was a pity she was gone but it was worse if his master was going to be like that\u2014he should have held on to her! Or at least see her off properly.Sebastian clicked his tongue. What was the point if his master finally fell in love? It would be meaningless if he acted as if his attitude towards her was the same as his other existing playmates.It was very apparent to Sebastian, who had accumulated quite a few years of experience. That his arrogant owner, who didn\u2019t know how to love, would be an utter fool in the future.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She did look good.\u201cThank you.\u201dDamia parted with the maids politely and left her room.She descended down the central staircase and arrived at the foyer. Through the glass on the front door, she saw a carriage that was waiting for her. The coachman, now well-rested after the debacle, looked better and welcomed her.\u201cCome on, milady. I\u2019ll escort you.\u201dDamia gently climbed the wagon with his help. The destination was obvious:\u201cThe Marquis of Evergreen.\u201dToday was the day that Cecil would drink tea with Louise. Even though she disliked Louise, due to their shared family business she was obligated to comply.It was of utmost importance to renew the contract between the noble families. For this reason, Cecil had to still meet with Louise. Even if she was planning on drugging her teacup.Damia was awfully distressed over her best friend and couldn\u2019t bear it.Although she knew what Louise had planned to feed Cecil, it didn\u2019t mean her worries were assuaged.\u2018I need to be by your side.\u2019Of course, it didn\u2019t mean that Damia would be an attendee at the scene of them renewing their contract.The business was very secretive and had many sensitive provisions, so a third party could not join.Therefore, Damia settled on waiting in the room next to the room where Cecil would renew the contract.With Cecil\u2019s permission, they had a small hole drilled through the wall adjoining the rooms. Damia would watch them through that hole and if Cecil was in a dangerous situation she would intervene.\u201cDamia! You came!\u201dAs soon as Damia reached the Marquis of Evergreen\u2019s estate, Cecil rushed out to greet her from the inside of the mansion.She was dressed elegantly for the event, her face donning suitable makeup and overwhelming anxiety.It was clear that Cecil hadn\u2019t slept last night, her eyes were puffy and the dark circles under her eyes peeked through her powder.\u201cOf course, I have to come, fool.\u201dDamia grinned, trying to ease her friend\u2019s tension. And she took the lead in finding the room she was supposed to wait in.If it had been a typical visit, tea and refreshments would have been set grandly for guests in the middle of the room, but today it was an unusual day.A comfortable wide chair lined with plenty of cushions was placed in front of the wall and adjacent to it was a small table with a silver tray with desserts.\u201cOh, my.\u201dDamia discreetly glanced back at Cecil, appreciating the arrangements she had made. It seemed Cecil was worried her friend would be hungry or bored while she waited in the room alone.\u201cHmm. No meringue cookies?\u201dDamia joked about her favorite snack. Cecil rolled her eyes and retorted.\u201cReally? You\u2019re going to munch and crunch on a loud cookie during this stealth spy mission?\u201d\u201cI could just melt it down with saliva.\u201dDamia took a once over the tray. Soft chocolate chip cookies, moist lemon madeleine, cheesecakes. All of them were foods that wouldn\u2019t make noise when consumed.\u2018As expected, Cecil is taking this seriously as well.\u2019For Cecil\u2019s sake, Damia had to watch Cecil carefully. Upon uttering the oath in her heart, Damia, who was now determined, sat in front of the wall. She repeated the plan to Cecil.\u201cIf you sense any danger, raise your hand. Then I\u2019ll run right in.\u201d\u201cYes. I took an antidote in advance just in case.\u201dShe didn\u2019t know if it would work because it\u2019s such an unfamiliar, new drug. Cecil murmured anxiously, pouting.Damia faintly smiled at the actions, words, and foods that reflected how thoroughly prepared she was.\u201cI\u2019m so glad, Cecil.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 what? Coming out of the blue.\u201d\u201cBecause you\u2019re a kid who takes care of my body like a master.\u201dIt was a compliment interlaced with strangely teasing abusive words. Cecil narrowed her eyes, not missing it.Damia, who saw this, promptly distracted her.\u201cGo now. Time is running out!\u201dCecil, who was being pushed out of the room, looked back. She finalized the plan with Damia.\u201cYou have to keep an eye on me and make sure I\u2019m alright. Okay? I trust and believe in you.\u201d\u201cOf course. I\u2019ll watch you without even blinking.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7No, blink\u2014that\u2019s too much.\u201dShe would have dry eyes. After Cecil bleakly replied, she turned around. Her face slipped into a subtly dismal expression as she went out to greet Louise. Nevertheless, her countenance was certainly more lively than before.\u2018Please, don\u2019t let anything happen to Cecil,\u2019Damia prayed earnestly inwardly. She pressed her body against the wall and peered into the hole.How many minutes have passed? From afar, Damia could hear the slapping sound of shoes and Louise\u2019s uniquely high and sharp laughter.Then the door creaked open, and finally, Cecil and Louise sat at a table.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

How long has it been since the two of us had an intimate conversation?\u201dWith both elbows on the table, Louise leaned forward and laughed. Then, she peeked at the teapot and teacup in front of her.\u2018Is this it?\u2019Damia was so anxious that she kept an eye on Louise\u2019s every move.Her eyes strained to see if she was putting anything in the tea.\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Oh, before we talk about business\u2026.\u201dSure enough, Louise\u2019s white and thin hands headed to the teapot.Seeing this, Damia reflexively rose her body halfway.But the next moment, Louise\u2019s actions were completely unexpected.Plop\u2014Louise\u2019s arms outstretched, pushed the teapot and teacup away without hesitation. And on the empty table, she spread out a plethora of documents she had brought with her.\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Miss Louise?\u201d\u201cOf course, it would be nice to talk leisurely over tea.\u201dLouise paused and smirked, one corner of her mouth lifted.As if Cecil\u2019s anxiety was amusing.\u201cI\u2019m a little busy today. I hope you can focus more on work than on tea. It\u2019s okay, right?\u201dLouise repeatedly urged her to finish it quickly. Dazed by this, Cecil was pushed back by her urgent impetus and accepted the task Louise gave her.\u201cWell, let\u2019s decide on this year\u2019s mineral delivery price first. According to this data, the recent mineral market price in the capital\u2026.\u201dLouise went straight into work. Cecil, who knew she planned to drug her, was dumbfounded. However, as Louise continued to discuss business, she began to concentrate on commerce at some point.\u201cWait! No matter how high inflation and prices in the capital have risen\u2014raising the delivery price by 15 percent is rubbish!!\u201dCecil was also serious about the family\u2019s business. She quickly went into negotiation mode, furious at the unit price Louise offered.It was clever of Louise to completely remove the teapot from the table. When the object of her fear disappeared, Cecil was no longer apprehensive.\u2018You can\u2019t do this.\u2019Meanwhile, Damia, who was watching the situation from the other room through the peephole, became uneasy. She stared at Louise\u2019s face.It was impossible to relax. If Louise didn\u2019t drug the tea she might try another tactic. Damia was scared to blink too much, so she kept her eyes wide on Louise until her dry eyes forced her eyelids to blink. But Louise really just kept talking about business. As if she was someone without ulterior motives.\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 Good. Let\u2019s do that then, this year.\u201dAfter two hours of bloody negotiations with Cecil, she finally agreed to a set price. Then she stamped a seal on the contract.\u201cIt\u2019s a good deal. I enjoyed it.\u201dLouise, who took a copy of the stamped contract, raised her body abruptly. Thanks to this, the table shook, and the teapot pushed into the corner rattled.Seeing this, Cecil\u2019s face belatedly showed signs of \u2018Oops! I was so absorbed in talking about the business that I forgot to be wary of Louise for a moment.\u2019Indeed, Louise didn\u2019t show any suspicious behavior.Just like now.\u201cThen I\u2019ll get going because I\u2019m busy. I look forward to our contract this year, Lady Cecil.\u201dWithout saying anything, Louise left. There was no hesitation in her departure.Cecil, left behind, stiffened with embarrassment.The Louise she knew wouldn\u2019t leave her alone and was always gossiping, making her sick and tired of people.However, today, when she had anticipated much to happen, other than work Louise had coolly left.\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7What is going on?\u201dCecil muttered as she looked at the cold teapot.Then Damia, who was rubbing her tired eyes over the wall, also agreed discreetly.\u201cRight?\u201dDid Cesare give Louise a suggestion in advance? If that were the case, only then could she understand this situation.Cesare had been hiding as if he had not returned from the High Temple. However, if Louise was on his side, she was more likely to have secretly contacted him.\u2018Yeah. Maybe that\u2019s it.\u2019Cesare was not a fool.If he realized Damia had discovered the cards he had prepared, he wouldn\u2019t have played his hand.\u201cHaaaaaa.\u201dOnly then did Damia release a deep breath, releasing the tension in her body, feeling deeply relieved. Her stiff shoulders dropped.She had made a mistake, this was all in vain but she didn\u2019t regret it. Thanks to this, she confirmed with her own eyes that Cecil was safe.\u2018I\u2019m glad nothing happened.\u2019However, Damia was ignorant of the fact that there was a \u2018real\u2019 gift awaiting her from Cesare.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Just in case, don\u2019t eat or drink anything that Louise brought as a gift, okay?\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 Yeah. \u201cCecil glanced at Louise\u2019s gift with an anxious look and pushed it away with her feet. Louise had brought something called \u2018red ginseng\u2019 imported from the East as a gift.It was a waste because it was precious, but there was nothing she could do. Even if the gift was innocent, there was no good feeling produced by the simple fact the giver was Louise.\u201cThank you for coming today. Goodbye, Damia.\u201dAfter Cecil saw her off, Damia departed for home.It was a sunny day. The clear wind carrying the scent of the forest blew through the carriage\u2019s window. The soothing rumble gently relaxed her nerves that had been on edge the whole morning.\u201cWe have arrived, miss.\u201dDid I doze off?Damia looked out, rubbing her eyes. Beyond the sky where the dim dusk fell, a familiar mansion was seen.Click-Outside, the coachman opened the door. Damia accepted the horseman\u2019s escort to get off the wagon with her skirt gathered as usual.Then, she was surprised.\u2018This feeling\u2026..\u2019It was not the usual feeling. The hand of the horseman in his 40s was very rough and hot. But instead the hand holding hers it was a cold and smooth hand.\u201cDamia.\u201dIt was as if she heard the coachman\u2019s panic behind her.A voice like frozen ice on a distant black lake.Damia recognized the owner of that voice before her eyes confirmed it. And in that moment she was so startled she lost her balance.\u201cOh!\u201dHer dress, like a white magnolia flower, fluttered in the air. If she fell from such a height off the carriage she would sprain her slender ankle.But before that, a hard arm and a wide chest grabbed and held her against them.The face reflected on Damie\u2019s big eyes was beautiful. A handsome young man with black hair and blue eyes with the cool impression unique to northerns was staring at her.\u201cYou almost fell down. You should be more careful.\u201dIt was an ominous warning. His lips as they addressed Damia made her think they were as red as poisonous apples.Damia clenched her teeth, suppressing her shuddering.\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Brother. Nice to see you\u00a0again.\u201dHe had been hiding as if he hadn\u2019t returned from the High Temple, and now she didn\u2019t know why he had appeared.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while, hasn\u2019t it?\u201dCesare did not easily fall for her provocation. As if he hadn\u2019t hid in her bedroom, it was despicable in her sight to see his eyes as clear and innocent as a young boy\u2019s.Also, the fact that she was in his arms was giving her goosebumps. Damia struggled to reduce their contact by even a tiny bit, pushing his shoulders away with both arms.\u201cGet off!\u201dBut Cesare was also a tall young man, so he easily overpowered her resistance.\u201cOh, my.\u201dCesare bitterly snickered, he subdued and pressed her waist and thighs tightly with both arms and clasped her even higher. It was high enough to break Damia\u2019s soft skull if she fell backwards. Damia, who felt a sense of crisis, stopped struggling for a moment.Her legs dangled in the air, and the hem of her white skirt floated. Seeing this, a smile bloomed across Cesare\u2019s face.\u201cIt looks like dandelions caught in the wind. How lovely.\u201dHow he wished he could encircle her like this. He wanted to take root down in her naval, wrap himself around her heart and suck on it until he drank up the last drop of blood.His feelings that were forced into her were so clingy that she was exhausted just by observing them. The pressure made her feel like she was suffocating and going to be swallowed up at any moment.Eventually, Damia, whose patience ran out, reached out and grabbed his hair.\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I asked you to let me down, brother.\u201dHer eyes on her opponent who was crushing her, burned blue with hostility. There was no reluctance in pulling Cesare\u2019s hair. If he dropped her to the ground, she would also make sure he fell down with her.\u201cAhh.\u201dAs Damia pulled Cesare\u2019s hair his tone was ambiguous, she wasn\u2019t sure if he was moaning in pleasure or exclaiming in pain.Then, he spoke quietly,\u201cThat\u2019s not enough. More, harder.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even though it must have been quite painful, Cesare did not grimace and twirled himself and her restrained body as if he was dancing.By this point, Damia began to feel more fear than hatred. Cesare was getting worse and worse. Fortunately, there was another unexpected person here to stop him.\u201cDamia!\u201dAs soon as she heard the voice, Damia doubted her ears.Her head snapped around automatically. As soon as she confirmed the owner of the voice, a teary voice popped out of her mouth.\u201cFather\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7!!!\u201d***It was very awkward to sit around with the \u201cfamily\u201d and drink tea.Noela was absent because Leon, Damia\u2019s younger half-brother, had a cold. Therefore, Damia and Cesare were the only people sitting around the tea table with Owen Primula, the head of the family.\u201cDoes the tea not suit your taste?\u201d\u201cOh, no.\u201dDamia shook her head at Owen\u2019s worried question. Perhaps because she was nervous, she couldn\u2019t even taste the tea. It was because Cesare was watching her from the other side of the table.\u201cYes, Damia. You\u2019re just as fragile as a young sprout. You have to eat well and get healthier.\u201dCesare was wearing the mask of her older \u2018brother\u2019 pretending to be friendly. Then, he proceeded to give Damia his share of dessert that came out with today\u2019s tea.\u201cEat mine, too. Isn\u2019t it your favorite?\u201dDamia looked down at the lemon cream cake he had pushed towards her. To be honest, she didn\u2019t want to eat anything Cesare gave her. However, her father, Owen, was looking at the scene with warm eyes on the other side, so it was too awkward and rude to openly refuse.\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Thank you. Brother,\u201dDamia, who smiled soullessly, replied pretentiously.Owen smiled tenderly as he saw this, the wrinkles around his eyes creasing with happiness.\u201cGood, Dami. Thanks to your brother, you can eat more cake.\u201dSince her father was away from home for a long time, he did not understand the relationship between Damia and Cesare well.\u00a0 However, he thought a brother with Damia would be much better than leaving his daughter alone in a large mansion everytime he traveled. It gave him comfort.\u201cHow have you been? Have you been healthy? Have you been eating well?\u201dWhen she heard her father\u2019s sweet question, Damia\u2019s nose tingled as if she was going to cry. Even if his body was away because of business, it was clear that her father\u2019s heart was always by her side.Just as parents had their duties to provide, Damia felt it was her duty as the child to bring comfort to her absent parent. Therefore, she pretended all was fine even if it wasn\u2019t fine and acted as if she was always happy even if she was lonely. It was his best thing she thought she could do for her father.\u201cOf course, father. I\u2019ve been eating too much.\u201dDamia smiled brightly and then took a few bites of the cake to show my father. Owen smiled happily when he saw his daughter eating something.\u2018It\u2019s so nice to have Father. How many months has it been?\u2019He had gone on a business trip shortly after Leon was born, so it was almost a year ago.Damia glanced at his father\u2019s face with nostalgic eyes. She felt bad for him because he seemed to have had a hard time at work and his face became paler, rousing her sympathy.\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7How is your business these days?\u201dDamia brought up the question she had been worried about. As she knew, Akkard and the royal family were suspicious of the \u2018Holy War\u2019 and in particular, he seemed to think that the High Temple was related to the \u201cpollution\u201d situation in the south.Damia had no choice but to worry about her father and family. Especially since he didn\u2019t know his adopted son, Cesare, was working with the High Temple and behind the \u2018Great War.\u2019\u201cAh, business. I was so busy recently that I even forgot to send you a letter. The whole kingdom is in turmoil because of pollution so everything is a mess.\u201dFortunately, Owen didn\u2019t consider his daughter\u2019s question to have any other intentions. He smiled calmly, trying to cover up his fatigue by rubbing his slightly swollen cheeks.\u201cBut thanks to Cesare coming and helping me, I was able to finish it earlier than scheduled and come back.\u201dContrary to Owen\u2019s words, Owen\u2019s gaze at his stepson was somehow hazy. Then Cesare, who had been sitting calmly all the time, replied meaningfully.\u201cNo, father. I was happy to have quality time amongst us men,\u201d Cesare, who finished his speech, gave Owen an incredulous look.The moment she saw this, Damie felt her heart throbbing in alarm.\u201cI\u2019ll take a moment to see how Leon\u2019s condition is. Take your time and talk.\u201dCesare, who smiled politely, left for a moment. As if he had planned something with Owen in advance.When he left, Owen wiped his face with a tired look. And he opened his mouth more carefully through his fingers.\u201cHey, Damia. I want to ask you something. \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d\u201cWhat is it, father?\u201dShe felt a little better as Cesare left. Damia asked her father back with a smile.\u201cRecently\u2026\u2026 It is said that you get along well with Lord Akkard of the Valerian Dukedom. Is that true?\u201dDamia\u2019s smile cracked.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Sir Akkard is just a friend,\u201dDamia hurriedly denied. Owen, who was staring at Damia, asked again, not believing her:\u201cReally?\u201dDamia smiled quietly.Akkard\u2019s magical charm didn\u2019t seem to work on her parents\u2019 generation.Owen\u2019s tone considered Akkard was nothing more than \u201ca fly flirting with my pretty daughter.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, father. Lord Akkard is\u2026\u2026. just friendly to all the ladies. It\u2019s not something important or anything like that.\u201dAs this was true Damia didn\u2019t have a shred of guilt. Owen let out a\u00a0 sigh of relief.\u201cI see. I guess I was worried for nothing.\u201dDamia laughed to reassure her father.Still, deep down inside a cool anger towards Cesare simmered.Owen was ignorant about high society news because he was so often away from home. He probably knew about Akkard because Cesare whispered about it next to him.\u201cOh, by the way, I almost forgot. I have something to deliver to you.\u201dOwen, who hit his forehead, took a letter out of his arms and handed it over.Since it is an envelope engraved with the pattern of the High Temple, Damia received it with a puzzled look.\u201cWhat is this?\u201d\u201cKael asked me to give it to him. I heard that he became a paladin? I was surprised when I bumped into him in the High Temple.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Ah.\u201dKael Roysten.Damia looked down at the letter in her hand as if it were poison.As if she touched the thorny splinter under her fingernail that she had forgotten, the pungent pain spread.She wondered when it would be okay to hear his name.Her remaining fragments of her unrequited love was not an emotion that she would show in front of her father. So Damia hurriedly folded the letter and covered her feelings.\u201cThank you. I\u2019ll read it later.\u201dOwen looked at his daughter smiling brightly at him. Her red rose-like hair and beautiful features that did not suit the barren north.The smile on her thick lips reminded him of her dead wife.\u201cYou\u2019ve grown up so well. Even under an ugly father like me, you grew up so pretty and nice.\u201dOwen muttered with a sad look on his face, forgetting himself.Damia quickly comforted him with an encouraging tone:\u201cDon\u2019t say that. Thanks to my father\u2019s presence, I\u2019ve always felt comfortable and safe.\u201dOwen smiled a little, but his expression itself didn\u2019t get any brighter. So Damia decided to quickly change the subject of the conversation.\u201cMore than that, my father.\u201d How long will you stay home this time?\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t be able to stay very long. Why?\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind\u2026\u2026 I\u2019d like to take a succession class soon. I\u2019d like to help you with my father\u2019s business in earnest.\u201dDamia spoke in a soft tone.She was nervous because Cesare kept attacking her but she was sincere in her desire to help out her father.Her father\u2019s face, which she saw briefly between months-long absentances, looked older and more tired every time he returned.Even though it was summer in the north his cravat and buttons were completely closed up to his neck and looked particularly suffocating.For this reason, whenever Owen bowed his head, more wrinkles were caught under his chin than necessary.Damia felt heartbroken about that. Nothing hurt more than seeing the rapid aging of her beloved parent. Therefore, she wanted to take over her father\u2019s business properly as soon as possible.\u2018I want to lessen my father\u2019s burden.\u2019In addition, if she participated in the business in earnest, she would find out more about the High Temple.It\u2019s been a while since Damia became an adult anyway. There was nothing wrong with taking succession education courses. Rather, it felt a little late compared to other families.Ordinary parents would be very happy to accept their children\u2019s growth. However, upon listening to Damia\u2019s words Owen\u2019s complexion darkened.\u201cThank you so much for saying that. However, Damia\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I may not have the right to say this, but this father wants you to always live a comfortable care-free life. I\u2019m being serious about this.\u201d [t1v: NOooooooo]Owen\u2019s lips seemed to become heavier. Damia looked at him with a strange look. The sight of her father frowning and taking a deep breath was as if he was gathering courage to bring up a difficult thing.\u201cI\u2019ve been watching over Cesare these past few years, and although he is my adopted son\u2026.he\u2019s quite smart and sincere. If he was my biological son, I would have made Cesare my successor. [t1v: Nooooox2]\u201cFather\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7? What are you saying?\u201d\u201cOf course, it is not impossible. Because he is the official son of the Primula family, who officially entered the country. I\u2019m no saint, but I\u2019m not narrow-minded enough to be prejudiced against a promising stepson.\u201d [t1v: ughhh.. i\u2019m ded.]Owen continued to speak as if he had memorized a prayer with a hazy look.As if they were words that he had prepared long before he came home.\u201cSo Damia\u2026\u2026I\u2019m sorry to ask\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, but do you have any thoughts of getting married?\u201d [t1v: ded x2]\u201cWhat?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Ahh, oh!\u201dHer body trembled as Lyle\u2019s fingers dug in trying to find her g-spot in her ass. Medea shook her head when his fingers stroked exactly where Medea enjoyed.\u201cAhh! Mm.. Ang! Your Majesty\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cLyle.\u201dHer reaction was as explicit as if the aphrodisiac used a long time ago also worked on her asshole. Lyle grinned when he saw Medea\u2019s eyes grow bigger.\u201cIt\u2019s here.\u201d\u201cOh my god!\u201dHer body jumped up as if it had been electrocuted.Lyle smiled and gently tapped on Medea\u2019s erotic place with his fingertips. Her eyes turned white as his oiled up fingers pushed against her inner tunnels.\u201cGasp! Ugh! At the same time..\u2026Ahhh!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s see how many times you can climax. After washing, I\u2019ll lick you up.\u2026 So that you can recall what you are experiencing now and I can ask you which one you like better.\u201d\u201cOh! Huh, no we can\u2019t.\u2026.\u201d\u2018You\u2019re going to lick me later after doing this?\u2019She shook her head with a bright red face of disbelief, but Lyle moved his fingers, enthralled by watching Medea as if she were adorable.\u201cAh! Oh! Umm\u2026unn\u2026.Ugh\u2026.Oh!\u201d***The bed sheets were wet. It might have been caused by lavender oil that Lyle used or liquid spilled from Medea.Lyle kissed Medea as he fondled her breast. She was half out of her mind. It was endearing to him that Medea trembled and twitched whenever his fingertips brushed her pointed nipples.\u201c\u2026 It wasn\u2019t bad. This kind of abstinence is good, too.\u201d [t1v: abstinence?!?!]While Medea climaxed 28 times, Lyle orgasmed six times. He climaxed from stroking it on Medea\u2019s ass, grinding against her pubic area without entering her or stroking his length between her closed thighs.\u201cHaaaa\u2026 ha\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dLyle licked her trembling lips and put his tongue back into Medea\u2019s mouth, Medea intertwined her tongue with Lyle\u2019s tongue. The sound of the water heated up his body, so Lyle kissed Medea for a long time while hugging her for a while.\u201cHaaa *sigh*\u2026\u201dLyle, who raised her head, carefully hugged Medea. It was a lovely sight to see Medea looking up at him with dreamy eyes. Lyle, who kissed her cheek, embraced Medea, lifted her and entered the bathroom together.If it was for a short time, this wouldn\u2019t be too bad either.\u2026. In the meantime, Lyle intended to discover all of Medea\u2019s erogenous zones.***\u201cAre these all gifts for the Empress from your Highness?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, the ducal heir.\u201d [Luke is confirming his identity]Typically, there was a person in the imperial palace who managed gifts. It would be problematic for officials to accept bribes in private, but it did not matter if they were for the Imperial family, so the nobles explicitly used to bribe the Imperial family.However, in the case of the Imperial family, bribery did not necessarily mean a request would be granted. The imperial family often considered it their natural right to receive such gifts.Lyle also put gifts in the national treasury, and there was no case of changing the policy just because he received a gift.\u2018But you\u2026\u2026.\u2019Medea also received many gifts during the time she became Empress. However, when it was revealed that she was not favored by the Emperor, the gifts dropped sharply to less than half.Until recently, only enough items came in to save face. But mainly gifts sent in consideration of the prestige of the Duke of Card.\u2018Is it different now?\u2019Medea wasn\u2019t one to be discouraged by the lack of gifts, but it was not being favored by the Emperor that pained her greatly.It was something to rejoice that her pain and weakness had been erased, but Luke was anxious because he was not sure if Medea was happy now.Just because the Emperor suddenly changed his mind and immersed himself in Medea like a boy experiencing his first love.\u2026. something felt suspicious and out of place to Luke.Most of the gifts sent to the Empress were gathered together and examined by wizards. It was their job to magically check whether the gifts were poisoned or bad for the fetus.Among them, the gifts of high-ranking aristocrats were separated and dealt with first. The same was true of Luke\u2019s gift. He was the younger brother of the Empress, so as soon as he arrived, his gifts were examined by magicians.Three carriages of gifts were carried into the Rose Hall of the Imperial Palace by the duke\u2019s servants.Officials who were classifying gifts that arrived for the Empress also looked at the incoming gifts as if they were surprised. Even if they were still in boxes, the boxes themselves were gorgeous and impressive enough to\u00a0 be considered a treasure on it\u2019s own.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Upon entering the Empress\u2019 palace, Luke glanced at the previous maid.\u201cIs his Majesty by the Empress\u2019s side?\u201d\u201cYes. Ever since his Majesty left the political affairs meeting.\u201dThe maid answered politely. Luke was lost in thought for a moment.\u201cHow is his Majesty? Does his Majesty care about her Majesty like the rumors say?\u201d\u201cHe cherishes her a lot. His Majesty is always by her Empress\u2019s side, except for when he steps aside to manage political affairs.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dIt was true then. Lyle didn\u2019t have a disposition where he could stay with someone he didn\u2019t like for a long time.\u201cWhat happened all of a sudden?\u2019It was good news for his sister, but Luke couldn\u2019t help but become worried because he knew that the Emperor was not a person who changed his mind so easily.Medea had long been the object of the Emperor\u2019s scorn and indifference. He couldn\u2019t imagine how hurt she would be if the Emperor rescinded his affection after she had tasted it\u2019s sweetness.\u2018I hope the Emperor is sincere.\u2019***\u201cYour Majesty the Emperor, your Majesty the Empress, the heir to the Duke of Card has arrived,\u201dannounced a handmaiden in front of the reception room of the Empress\u2019 palace. There seemed to be a drowsy voice from the inside, so the maids opened the door and stepped aside.\u201cYour Majesty the Emperor. Your Majesty the Empress. I greet you after a long time.\u201dAs the maid had told Luke, Lyle was next to Medea. He sat side by side with Medea and hugged her waist and made her lean on her. Luke was internally quite surprised by the unimaginable sight before him, but he greeted them as if he saw nothing.\u201cThis is a gift from the Duke of Card.\u201dWhen Medea beckoned with curiosity, Luke made the Duke\u2019s servants bring things.A box made of gold was first brought into the inside, and then a box made of platinum took over the room one after another. When Luke winked, the servants opened the box one by one.\u2018Oh my god\u2026 What\u2019s all this?\u2019Since morning, Medea had received gifts from high-ranking aristocrats. But none of them compared to the gifts from the Duke of Card.Luke watched with joy as Medea, who woke up from her seat, looked at the golden box with curious eyes.Lyle seemed to be vigilant. He hadn\u2019t even announced the pregnancy yet, but already they had found two gifts with poison. The \u2018gifters\u2019 had been caught. But Lyle was wary, he\u2019d rather be safe than sorry.Why had that happened?Lyle had never even been threatened since he had become Emperor.Medea had also an unshakable position because the Duke of Card was behind her. Trying to poison Medea now seemed to be a belated and poor attempt.Rather, it would have made more sense if the Medea had an assassination attempt against her after giving birth to a son. The Duke of Card could have come out as the guardian of the Crown Prince and it would have been a masterful maneuver to hold the empire in his hands.But it didn\u2019t make sense to kill Medea now. Why would he want to kill Medea now?\u2018Is it because you are favored by me?\u2019Until now, Medea had been wielding power in Card Duke\u2019s name, but had not the confident standing as an Empress. Of course, Medea had attempted to remedy that.\u201cRight\u2026 There were Medea\u2019s suicide attempts.\u201dThe first few accidents had vaguely raised his suspicions that someone might have been after her, as Medea had claimed.However, after that, it was revealed that Medea herself had fabericated those assassidenation threats, then she herself tried to commit suicide and made a fuss, so he had ignored it. Like the story of the boy who cried wolf.Lyle frowned at the sudden thought. Coincidentally, it was a story that could not be confirmed because Medea had amnesia.\u201cThank you for coming, Luke.\u201dAt Medea\u2019s word\u2019s, Luke\u2019s face flushed with joy.\u201cNo, thank you\u2014I\u2026 I wanted to see you again.\u201dMedea was relieved by Luke\u2019s response. After their last meeting she had guessed it would be right to address each other without titles and be on a first name basis. At least in the absence of other nobles.\u201cI heard that you have good news,\u201d he said, \u201cso I had come to convey my congratulations.\u201cOh. It\u2019s embarrassing to hear that from Luke.\u201d\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m still in the early stages, so I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s changed because I\u2019m slow.\u201dWhat was the only notable change was that she had not menstruated. It was the significant reason why she had called a doctor.\u201c\u2026 Are these the only gifts you have? I think the Duke sent something else,\u201dAfter Lyle\u2019s words, Luke winked at the servant with a nervous look. The servant returned with a box engraved with the Duke\u2019s coat of arms. When Luke opened the lid, a large necklace with quail-sized rubies appeared.\u201cIt\u2019s a congratulatory gift from my father to His Majesty.\u201d\u201cWow\u2026 It\u2019s big\u2026\u2026.\u201dIn fact, the Empress Palace had tons of jewelry received at the Imperial wedding or inherited from the predecessor Empresses, but the current Medea did not even know they existed. Medea\u2019s eyes widened when the large jewel-studded necklace that belonged in a movie suddenly appeared.\u2018It\u2019s pretty, but\u2026\u2026 Does this go around a person\u2019s neck? I think it\u2019s going to be heavy.\u2019\u201cWould you like to try it on?\u201dLuke asked Medea, who could not be touched easily. Medea hesitated for a moment and then reached out to the necklace.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If she got a glimpse at the family\u2019s insignia or portrait in the hallway, she could know where she was. Before going out, Damia studied the drawing room.\u2018I think I\u2019ve seen this before.\u2019There was Eastern-continental style pottery decorated in the middle of the drawing room. It was unique and familiar.But, in recent years, various items, including tea leaves from the Eastern Continent, had been very popular in the kingdom. So it was not unique anymore.Damia was unsure if the dreadful hunch she had was right.As she hesitated, the door to the drawing room suddenly opened.\u201cWhat? You were awake?\u201dThe man who slipped inside looked surprised. His face mixed with blood from the Eastern continent had a beautiful and unique atmosphere like a woman. Yet, the corners of his eyes and mouth looked rather apprehensive.Damia easily recognized him and frowned. She hadn\u2019t expected him but she knew him.\u201cKlaus?\u201dWhen Damia said his name inadvertently, Klaus exaggeratedly admired her.\u201cWow. You remember me? It\u2019s probably the first time we\u2019ve met since we were children.\u201d\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7It wasn\u2019t actually the first time.Damia had recently overheard his conversation with Louise. If she hadn\u2019t gotten a peek at his face at the time, Damia would have forgotten Klaus completely. It had been such a long time since they stopped interacting with each other.However, Klaus seemed surprisingly happy that Damia recognized him.Covering the tail of his slightly raised mouth with his hand, he approached as if he were indignant. Then, he sat down on the sofa, and he gestured towards Damia.\u201cCome sit down.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYou must have a lot of questions for me, right?\u201dFortunately, Klaus appeared very sympathetic.Of course, compared to others on Cesare\u2019s side.Damia hesitated for a while, but she had so few options.Holding the wrapped up sheet around her body tighter, she sat on the sofa opposite of him.After seeing this, Klaus\u2019 sharp eyes slightly bent in amusement.\u201cGreat. Nice to see you again, Lady Damia.\u201dHis voice was still friendly. It was as if he had playful and a little mischievously addressed her as he done when they were kids.It was as if a child had cornered a cat and was having fun.Damia was not a cat, so her displeasure quietly simmered inside.She asked in a calm voice without any signs of embarrassment,\u201cYou\u2019re the heir of Count Hwari, right?\u201d\u201cYes. Do you remember playing with me here when you were a kid? My mother is from the East continent, so she likes to have guests. Especially whenever my sister came, she was very happy. In the East, red means good luck.\u201dDamia nodded quietly.The drawing room had seemed unfamiliar but also felt familiar. However, after listening to Klaus, Damia was convinced that she was right.With her eyes down, she managed to recall her memories, pressing her throbbing temple in the aftermath of the sleeping pill.\u2018My father definitely asked me to meet a marriage suitor yesterday.\u2019And this must be the result of Cesare\u2019s manipulation.Considering his obsession with her, it was impossible for Cesare to actually let her marry another man.However, he was in a position that he could not officially marry Damia since he was her stepbrother.All these clues lead Damia to reach a conclusion immediately.\u2018You\u2019re planning a fake marriage for me.\u2019Cesare was going to tie her to Klaus just as someone leaves their valuables in the storage box for a while.Klaus was of his faction anyway. Considering that he was four years younger than Cesare, he was probably Cesare\u2019s subordinate.He was going to pair Klaus with Damia for now, and later take the position for himself. Damia concluded her thoughts and was amazed.She raised her head, feeling Klaus\u2019 gaze, watching her.\u201cSo. Are you ready?\u201dasked Klaus, languidly sitting on the sofa and propping his chin.Trying not to get caught up in his volatile pace, Damia asked back,\u201cReady for what?\u201d\u201cUmm, pretending not to know.\u201dKlaus rose slowly.Then he bent one knee in front of Damia, who was covering herself with a sheet, and stretched out his arm.Her white feet were held in Klaus\u2019 hands in no time.Klaus grasped her slender ankle like a shackle and playfully kissed her foot\u201cReady to be my fiance,\u201dhe said while looking up at Damia, the corner of his eyes smiling.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was apparent why Cesare would mobilize Klaus and undertake such a cumbersome play.\u2018Probably because of Lord Akkard.\u2019Damia knew him as well as he knew himself.No idiot would ignore a viper when you didn\u2019t know when it would strike and bite the back of one\u2019s neck. Instead, one would be hyper-aware, observing the serpent\u2019s every move without breathing.He pretended to be relaxed, but Cesare was nervous. Because an unexpected variable called Akkard Valerian appeared, he was afraid he would ruin all his plans, snatch Damia away and disappear.\u201c\u2026\u2026.Older Sister [Nuna] Damia,\u201dKlaus lifted himself from her feet.As a mature young man, he straightened his back, and a shadow fell over Damia, who was sitting on the sofa.\u201cKlaus?\u201dDamia pulled up the sheet and covered her chest a little more, and leaned back. Klaus bent down and grabbed both handles of the sofa where Damia sat. His face was hidden in the shadows against the sunlight.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while, but answer me.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cRemember, the letter I sent. Why\u2026.Did you ignore it?\u201d\u201cLetter? What letter?\u201dDamia blinked blankly as if she was unable to compute his words.Then Klaus got furious and raised his voice:\u201cDon\u2019t pretend you don\u2019t know!! The letter I sent you on New Year\u2019s Day last year!!\u201c\u2026.Do you mean a New Year\u2019s card?\u201d\u201cIt can\u2019t be like that. I asked you to come out to the vacant lot in front of the temple where we hung out often!!\u201dThe more she listened, the stranger it seemed. She couldn\u2019t be questioned for something she had no clue about.So Damia replied calmly:\u201cI\u2019ve never received such a letter.\u201d\u201cDo you swear?\u201d\u201cI swear under the name of the goddess.\u201dKlaus closed his mouth when Damia promptly answered under oath.A northerner never lied under the goddess\u2019s name.Knowing this, Klaus\u2019 fierce countenance softened.Watching him, Damia inquired carefully,\u201cBut why did you ask me to come out?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026You don\u2019t have to know.\u201dHe clenched his chin and replied coldly.Damia mind started to race. She looked around, trying to find an opportunity to escape, but it seemed hopeless.To make matters worse, Klaus saw her gaze, snickered, and asked cynically:\u201cWhy? Do you want to run away?\u201dThe desire to answer yes was burning her insides but knowing it wouldn\u2019t help, Damia asked for something else instead,\u201cAt least let me put on some clothes.\u201d\u201cNot allowed.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dKlaus didn\u2019t answer her question. He was already preoccupied with other thoughts.\u201cThe thing is\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 Damia nuna.\u201dKlaus\u2019s forehead had a deep frown as if he were contemplating something, slowly addressing her.\u201cThen\u2014nuna, what do you think of me?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t dislike you. We share fond childhood memories together.\u201dOf course, it was until Klaus got involved in this. However, there was no need to provoke Klaus by bringing it up.Not knowing the sentiments Damia swallowed, Klaus\u2019s expression became subtle.\u201cEven if I\u2019m a half-breed eastern? Don\u2019t you think I look weird?\u201d\u201cYou? No. I think your black eyes are pretty.\u201dSince this was her honest thought, Damia readily responded.Klaus shut his mouth and stared into her eyes.Damia did not avoid his gaze, but instead, he started to blush and lowered his eyes.\u201cThen I\u2019ll give you an option.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dDamia asked back without much expectation.Observing Klaus\u2019 tone was so intense, Damia thought he was probably offering a shit alternative.\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 Promise me that you will be mine.

At this stage of hopelessness, an uncaring, detached Damia began to reach a state of nirvana.\u00a0What nonsense are you spouting when we\u2019ve been estranged from each other all this time?\u201cDoes that mean you\u2019re going to betray Cesare? It will be hard to handle the aftermath,\u201dsolicited Damia calmly with a soulless smile.Flared up, Klaus retorted back with the temper of a young man.\u201cI don\u2019t care! After all, Cesare is nothing without the Great Temple backing him up\u2014!!\u201dKlaus seemed to have quite a lot of dissatisfaction with Cesare.Perhaps it was due to Cesare\u2019s insignificant origins and other reasons Damia didn\u2019t know.Anyway, it was a good omen that there was a division within the opposition. But when Damia thought about it, Klaus\u2019 proposal was utterly vain and immature.It was reasonable to be impulsive. But, even at a glance, Damia knew a kid like Klaus was no match for Cesare.Plus, Damia\u2019s situation was continuing to grow direr. Her beloved father was addicted to brainwashing drugs, and considering the threat of the High Temple behind Cesare\u2026\u2026.. certainly, Klaus would be of no help and couldn\u2019t protect her.\u201cDon\u2019t do this, Klaus.\u201dDamia, who was growing rapidly weary, sighed and addressed him as she had often done when they were young.\u201cStop this and bring me clothes. And let me leave here. Then I won\u2019t take issue with what happened today.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Do I still look like the same kid from our childhood?\u201dAs Klaus said this, he pushed Damia\u2019s shoulder and caused her to fall back on the sofa.\u201cI was going to be kind to you. But if Nuna comes out like that, I can\u2019t help it!\u201dKlaus climbed on top of her and roughly yanked off the cravat around his neck.Looking down at Damia, he roared:\u201cThis is because of Nuna!!\u201dDamia frowned without answering. That she was treated like this by a junior, who used to follow her around when they were young, hurt her pride and was more unpleasant than she imagined.Klaus raised his chin and began to unbutton his shirt. Damia took the opportunity to turn her body away, but it seemed difficult to escape this laid-down position. Instead, the sheet covering her flesh seemed precarious and slightly loosened around her due to her struggle.To make matters worse, the outside of the drawing-room, which had been quiet so far, became noisy. Perhaps this place was near the entrance because Damia could hear several noblewomen laughing while leaving their coats and belongings.When Damia glanced at the door at the commotion, Klaus stopped taking off his clothes and smirked.\u201cDo you remember? My mother liked to invite guests.\u201d\u201cKlaus, you can\u2019t be\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201dIt was only then that Damia realized why he approached her like this.Damia was not the type to meekly accept this forced marriage even through her father. Cesare planned this trick to corner her.In order to keep Damia and Klaus engaged, they decided to create a so-called \u201cestablished fact.\u201dOnly then did Damia feel a sense of crisis. She was now dressed in a sexy chemise and was lying under a half-naked Klaus.If she was seen by the noblewomen outside in this state\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7. The northern rumor mill will soon be in turmoil.\u2018No!\u2019Panicking, Damia struggled even more. Finally, the movement removed the sheet completely, revealing her luscious cleavage and scantily clad breasts. At this sight, Klaus\u2019 eyes became hazy.\u201cDamia nuna\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u201dKlaus pressed Damia\u2019s hands down and bent down. Right when his face was about to be buried between Damia\u2019s breasts. Damia looked up at him with no expression and kicked him between his legs with her knees as hard as possible.\u201cArgh!\u201dTo her surprise attack, Klaus was helpless. It was the first time that he, who was still young, had ever climbed on a woman.As a result, it was very clumsy, even if his momentum was good. Thanks to this, Damia, who spotted the opportunity, was able to kick her opponent properly in his crotch.She had barely been able to move due to their proximity, but her knees had been enough to hurt the man.ThudKlaus, who grabbed his groin, rolled off the sofa. Damia quickly got up and grabbed the straps of the chemise that had fallen off. Then, she ran to flee the drawing-room.But before she could reach the door, Klaus half-crawled and snatched Damia\u2019s ankle. Damia fell hard on the floor.\u201cAh!\u201dThere was a fluffy carpet on the floor, so she hadn\u2019t been seriously injured.Right away, Klaus climbed onto Damia\u2019s body and pressed his limbs down.\u201cHow dare you! I can\u2019t forgive you!!\u201dKlaus\u2019 boyish face was stained with pain, anger, and oddly enough\u2014betrayal.Just as he was about to grab Damia\u2019s camise and tear it apart\u2014 someone pulled Klaus\u2019 hair from behind.\u201cAaugh!!\u201dKlaus\u2019 head was tilted back and screamed. His head had been pulled so hard that he had thought his spine had broken for a moment.\u201cGet lost right now, you little brat.\u201dA very overbearing muscular man with silver hair and tanned skin growled.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Why are you here\u2026.\u201dAstonished, Damia\u2019s eyes widened in surprise as she looked up at him.She never thought in her wildest dreams she would see Akkard here. Seeing her dumbstruck face, Akkard clicked his tongue.\u201cI\u2019ll explain later. First, let\u2019s get out of this situation.\u201dOutside the room, one of the ladies that were chatting outside remarked, \u2018Huh? Didn\u2019t you hear something?\u2019 Followed by various speculations.\u2018I have to clean you up immediately,\u2019Akkard thought after seeing Damia\u2019s barely-there outfit.Klaus also struggled recklessly, pulling on Akkard\u2019s forearm, connected to the hand grabbing his hair. His plan seemed to be ruined.\u201cLet go of me! Let go! Who are you?!\u201d\u201cShut up.\u201dUnfortunately for him, Akkard didn\u2019t blink an eye and stuck Klaus\u2019 head on the sofa\u2019s armrest. With the sound of a ripe watermelon colliding with another melon, Klaus groaned.\u201cUgh!!\u201d\u201cHaven\u2019t fainted yet? Then one more time.\u201d\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 he is also bad-tempered.Damia tired gaze took in the image of Akkard almost smashing Klaus\u2019 head as he pounded it over and over again.Shortly, Klaus became kneaded as dough. The sight made the corners of Akkard\u2019s lips gradually soar up.\u201cUhh\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u201dFinally, after Klaus\u2019 painful groan, he passed out.Akkard threw the drooping Klaus randomly on the floor and kicked him with his foot.Crack\u2014It sounded strange as if a bone had broken. Damia\u2019s eyes shook, Akkard shrugged and added as an excuse:\u201cI wanted to make sure he had really fainted.\u201dEven so, it seemed a very emotional, impulsive action. Did Klaus offend and earn Akkard\u2019s ire and cause him to begrudge him? She didn\u2019t know.Damia glanced at the knocked out Klaus. Then Akkard\u2019s expression quickly showed his dissatisfaction.Sneakily blocking her view of Klaus with his body, he lifted Damia up with one arm.\u201cIt\u2019s not time to be idle, Damia. Hurry up and take off your clothes.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026What? Take off my clothes?\u201dWhat does he mean by this?Damia looked down at her thin camise, which was half ripped off. If she took even this merger covering off she would be completely naked.However, Akkard did not explain further. Turning around, he began to undress the unconscious Klaus. Damia, who was puzzled by what he was doing at first, soon realized his intention.\u2018Are you going to dress me in Klaus\u2019 clothes?\u2019She had never worn men\u2019s clothes before, but at least it was better than what she was currently wearing.Shy, Damia hesitated but took off her camise, waiting calmly,\u00a0 as she covered her breasts with her long hair and arms.After Akkard roughly took off Klaus\u2019 shirt and pants, he looked back at her. He was about to hand over the clothes, but faltered for a moment.Holding out her hand, Damia looked around, wondering what was wrong with him. Then, as if he was alarmed by his actions, Akkard quickly handed over the clothes.\u201cGet dressed, hurry!\u201d\u201cYes, yes.\u201dWas it her imagination? Akkard turned his back to her but the tips of his ears and the back of his neck looked more red than usual.Confused, Damia\u2019s head tilted while she began to dress.Although Klaus was slender for a man, his clothes were big on her as she had expected. While she was putting on the clothes, she could feel Akkard\u2019s stare on her. It was a threatening and intense glare as if he was about to attack her at any moment.Damia\u2019s hand slightly trembled, as she tried to hook the buttons. She willed her hands to stabilize with a sense of crisis and succeeded in putting on the man\u2019s clothes, albeit clumsy.\u201cWhoo,\u201d Damia let out a breath she had been holding in. \u201cWhat do you think? Did I put it on right?\u201dAkkard looked through Damia with disapproving eyes without an answer. He had handed the clothes to her himself, with his own hand, but it was very unpleasant to see her wearing another man\u2019s shirt.\u2018It even looks good on you.\u2019This is why beauty is unfair. How can you be so pretty with a bare face and in men\u2019s clothes too big for you?However, it was not time to leisurely appreciate Damia\u2019s beauty. Without any time for him to adjust her loose sleeves and pants, the murmur of the ladies grew near.I\u2019m done with my clothes, but what should I do next?Damia looked around the drawing room with alert eyes.Knocked out Klaus had only his underwear on, Damia had taken his clothes and tall, formidable Akkard emitted an overwhelming presence. If others saw this situation, she had no idea what they would think.Damia was restless, not knowing what to do. Seeing her anxious, Akkard unexpectedly laughed.\u201cPfft.\u201dAsking her what she was standing around for, Akkard pulled her away. He looked around and pushed her behind a long, splendid curtain that flowed out.\u201cDon\u2019t come out until I tell you to.\u201dHe closed the curtain.The curtains densely embroidered with bamboo, imported from the Eastern Continent, made it hard to see inside the room. However, if she put her eyes close from her side, she could peek into the drawing room through a tiny gap in the pattern.\u2018What the hell is he planning to do?\u2019Anxious, Damia watched Akkard. But his next action was beyond her expectations.Akkard picked up the torn camise, which Damia had taken off earlier, from the floor and he began to put on Klaus\u2019 nude body.\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7?!!\u201dDamia doubted her own eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It had a thin, light lace material and was decorated with cute pink ribbons.No matter how slim Klaus was, he was a man with vastly different proportions. The camise\u2019s boning looked disastrous as it was forced across his body.The chest and thighs were so tight against the clothes that they were on the verge of bursting, and under the tightly stretched lace his brown nipples\u2026\u2026 both were clearly visible.Even his bulging crotch protruding under the soft, flowy skirt\u2026. She couldn\u2019t look more. [t1v: I\u2019ll look for you]\u2018My eyes.\u2019Damia covered her face with both hands. Not in a physical sense, but mentally her eyes were burning.At this point, she was dying of curiosity. Why the hell did Akkard switch her clothes with Klaus\u2019?In the midst of this, the presence of the women continued to get closer. Now she could hear the sound right in front of the door, but Akkard didn\u2019t even seem nervous. Rather, as if to welcome them, he sat on the sofa as if he was in his own home and even looked majestic and dignified.\u201cI kept hearing strange noises from this drawing room. Is it just me?\u201d\u201cIs there someone inside?\u201d\u201cThat can\u2019t be.\u201dThe door suddenly opened, and the first person to enter was Countess Hwari, the mistress of the estate. She froze, flabbergasted by her son\u2019s ridiculous and humiliating appearance\u00a0 on the floor.\u201cKlaus? What\u2019s this\u2026..?\u201dUnfortunately, she was so embarrassed she couldn\u2019t close the door quickly. The curious ladies peered into the drawing room over her shoulder through the open door, and were taken aback.\u201cOh my, my oh my!!\u201d\u201cOh my goddess, what\u2019s going on?\u201dThe eyes of the ladies shook wildly when they saw Klaus\u2019 ghastly appearance on the floor. Among the frozen women, Countess Hwari was the first to come to her senses.\u201cOh my god, Klaus!! Sweetheart!!!\u201dTerrified, she ran to Klaus, who was unconscious, and shook his body. It was natural to be worried about her son, who had been fine this morning, was now on the floor. [t1v: that this is her first reaction makes me love her]But her technique was not particularly useful. As she shook Klaus\u2019 body, the skirt, which had been barely covering his crotch, slipped off. Thanks to this, something small and precious to Klaus was completely revealed through the well-ventilated summer underwear opening. [t1v: LMAO]\u201cAck!\u201d\u201cOh my goddess!!\u201dSuddenly, the ladies who suffered fatal eye damage were on the precipice of fainting\u2014stumbling as if they were about to collapse. Only then did the Countess realize what she had done and hurriedly lowered her son\u2019s skirt. She stared fiercely at Akkard sitting on the sofa.\u201cYou\u2014Who are you?! Did you make my son like this? How dare you in my house\u2014?\u201dHer accent mixed the inflection of the Eastern continent was sharp like a knife made of bones. However, Akkard was not at all intimated and expressed his displeasure.\u201cOye, this is what I wanted to ask.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about? What did you do to my son? What happened\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7?!!\u201dThe countess shouted fiercely with her eyes full of tears.Akkard frowned as if his ears hurt at her cry. Then, he pointed at Klaus in the explicit tight camise. Especially at his bulging groin.\u201cUgh, gosh. You don\u2019t know even after seeing that? The perv was about to attack, why wouldn\u2019t I hit him?!!\u201dHe shouted loudly as if he wanted the noblewomen gathered in the corner to hear.Of course, the one that Klaus had attacked hadn\u2019t been Akkard. Extremely vicious, he cleverly omitted the subject and announced it. The ripple effect that his words brought was beyond imagination.\u201cHyuk!!\u201d\u201cDid you just hear that?\u201d\u201cThis is ridiculous!\u201dThe trembling eyes of the ladies alternated between Klaus and Akkard\u2026. and, towards Countess Hwari, who was processing this tremendous news.The Countess\u2019 countenance turned pale upon feeling their curious eyes. She raised her trembling hand, pointing to Akkard, and asked back in disbelief:\u201cWhat\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7m\u2014my son just now\u2026 attacked you\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7?\u201d\u201cYes. He suddenly asked me to come because he had something to say, and when I arrived, he rushed at me like that. Well, it\u2019s nothing weird. My body is extraordinary even to men.\u201dAkkard raised his chin without blinking and slowly swept his hair over. Then, over the shirt, his thick forearms, hard chest, and a well-formed abdomen were emphasized.The eyes of the ladies who took in this sight became hazy. He was such an attractive man that no one could dare deny it if they had an ounce of discernment.Even Countess Hwari could not discount or disregard his beauty. She was often burdened with her son\u2019s sensitive temper, so they had not able to talk very often. Therefore, she didn\u2019t know who Klaus liked or what kind of taste he had.So she could not be sure that my son was not a pervert. As the Countess\u2019 teeth clenched and shook, a winning smile donned Akkard\u2019s mouth.\u201cI want to publicly sue your son immediately.\u201dShrugged Akkard as if he was disgusted and cut short the end of his speech [t1v: he is not tagging the \u2018yo\u2019 at the end of his words and so he is not bothering to show her respect]. Then he added, pretending to show tolerance:\u201cBut, I don\u2019t like it when things get bigger because I\u2019m lazy. So, choose. Whether to apologize to me here and quietly cover up this matter, or we can solve this in court.\u201d\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 He was really no different from the devil.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

May your anger be relieved.\u201dCountess Hwari lowered her metaphorical tail, helplessly. She had no choice but to do so.If only Akkard could testify here, she had to act more cautiously. At least until after waiting for the knocked out Klaus to wake up, she would decide after hearing her son\u2019s side what to do further.However, there were too many other witnesses here. Therefore, the Countess determined she had to conclude an agreement with Akkard as soon as possible to shut the mouths of other ladies.\u00a0 Otherwise, in practically no time rumors would spread all over northern society.\u201cFine. I\u2019ve received your apology, so I\u2019ll let it slide this time. From now on, take care of your son properly.

But since there were so many eyes she had no choice but to lower her head and accept the humiliation.\u201cHurry up and take Klaus to his room.\u201dThe Countess hurriedly ordered servants to remove her passed out son.

From now on, she had to gently coax them and conceive them to keep their mouths shut.Finally, Akkard, who was left alone in the drawing room, stretched out like a winner. He nodded and motioned towards the curtain.\u201cYou can come out now, Dami.\u201dDamia gingerly stepped out from behind her hiding spot. Despite being helped by Akkard, she looked exhausted. Just witnessing his tremendous personality with her own eyes was astonishing.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026 Thank you. Thanks to you, I was able to overcome this crisis.\u201dRegardless, she was polite and didn\u2019t forget to thank him. As a result, Akkard felt smug and quite pleased.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t difficult for me.\u201dThere was no man who was not interested in saving a beauty in distress. In particular, after being praised by the beauty he protected, his desire to show off as a man was bound to be thoroughly satisfied.However, Akkard\u2019s prideful smugness did not last long. Damia, who was rolling up her long trousers so she could escape, suddenly asked,\u201cHowever, Sir Akkard. How did you find me here?\u201dAkkard\u2019s proud shoulders stiffened at her question.In fact, the story of his arrival was quite long.* * *\u201cSomething big just happened,\u201dsaid Lessid Ferry, who suddenly visited his mansion.Of course, Akkard frowned because he didn\u2019t know what this entailed. He was in a bad mood, having his leisurely nap cut short.\u201cWhat?\u201dLessid didn\u2019t mind his blunt question. Gathering his delicate eyebrows on his forehead, he hurriedly opened his mouth.\u201cMiss Damia will soon be engaged to Klaus Hwari.\u201d\u201c\u2026 What? What the fuck are you talking about?\u201dAkkard, who had been drowsy stretching, froze and asked back. It was so sudden that he felt it absurd rather than irate.Then Lessid shouted, stomping his feet in frustration.\u201cThis is not the time to be like this! A few days ago, I witnessed Cesare Primula in the High Temple Hall. After following him I overheard him say he was going to have Damia engaged to Klaus.\u201dKlaus? He\u2019d heard this name before. Fervently, Akkard shook his head to shake off the remnants of his nap. He realized where he had heard that name. It was overheard in the conversation in the locker.\u2018That day, [she] was awfully pretty.\u2019Of course, Akkard wasn\u2019t praising Klaus. What Akkard recalled was the sight of an improper and elegant Damia that day.The memory was so intense that everytime he looked at a locker, his lower part became stiff. Thanks to this phenomenon, he felt dirty as if he had become a pervert lusting after lockers. It was all Damia Primula\u2019s fault that his body was like this.\u2018But you\u2019re getting engaged to another bastard?\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He didn\u2019t know what that madman, Damia\u2019s step older brother, was thinking when he was pushing for an engagement.The sleepiness disappeared from Akkard\u2019s purple eyes.It was only an hour later that he arrived at Count Primula\u2019s estate. Leon was the first to discover Akkard, who appeared on horseback like a thunderstorm.\u201cAbuu?\u201dLeon, the youngest member of the Primula family, was out in the garden and was practicing walking. As he waddled around holding a maid\u2019s hand, he glanced up at Akkard.Surprisingly, the young Leon remembered him. It was Leon who ate up all the southern macaroons that Akkard gave Damia during his first visit.\u201cAva!\u201dLeon, who recognized the visitor who brought delicious snacks, clapped his hand. And as a sign of welcome, he drooled on his bib.\u201cLeon, you\u2019re so\u2014Oh my!!\u201dNoela, who followed Leon later, found Akkard belatedly. She was of the timid-sort and was startled.Akkard delivered a formal greeting without getting off the horse.\u201cI\u2019m sorry to visit without prior notice. Rather, where is Damia?\u201dIt was a greeting that had excluded a lot. It was not that far from looking especially sorry.However, Noella was so flustered she did not notice it.\u201cDid you come to see Damia now?\u201dshe asked while hugging the young Leon, her eyes widening.As Akkard nodded, Noella\u2019s lips shut with a face that reflected how awkward she felt.She recalled Akkard visiting with flowers and gifts last time to court Damia. She couldn\u2019t bring herself to say that Damia went to meet her to-be-fiance in front of him.\u201cPlease tell me. Where is Damia?\u201dasked Akkard in a more stern tone.He had anticipated her so when he couldn\u2019t catch sight of her, his stomach started boiling like magma. Feeling as if his hot emotions were going to burst out like lava at any moment, Akkard clenched his teeth.Fortunately, someone stepped up on behalf of the frozen Noella. He was a middle-aged man with gray black hair and blue eyes.\u201cYoung man\u2026. Who are you to be looking for my daughter?\u201dIt was Owen Primula, the head of the family. Realizing who he was, Akkard immediately descended from his horse and bowed his head politely toward Damia\u2019s biological father.\u201cExcuse me. I\u2019m Akkard of the Duke of Valerian.\u201dIt was a polite greeting that even the Crown Prince Heinrich had rarely received.However, Owen, who had no clue of this, frowned and repeated his name,\u201cIf you are Akkard Valerian\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201dThat playboy?The gap between Owen\u2019s eyebrows became narrower due to his displeasure. Steadfastly ignoring this, Akkard reached out to Owen, as one was supposed to do in polite high society upon the first time one met someone.\u201cNice to meet you.\u201dAfter hesitating Owen clasped Akkard\u2019s outstretched hand. For the brief moment they shook hands, Akkard glanced at Owen with a sharp hawk-like gaze.\u2018His hands are cold even in the summer. His eyes are bloodshot, and his pupils are too big.\u2019Having encountered neurological-affecting drug addicts in the capital several times, Akkard quickly noticed that Owen took drugs.Of course, Lessid made a great contribution by noticing this:\u2018But it\u2019s unusual. The Count Primula I know is not one to force his daughter to marry. I don\u2019t know why he is suddenly moving as Cesare said,\u2019Lesid muttered, saying under his breath,\u00a0\u2018Does he have a weakness?\u2019That alone was enough for Akkard to piece together the puzzle.He had already heard from Damia that Cesare had a \u201cdrug.\u201d Now convinced of Owen\u2019s addiction, mentally Akkard clicked his tongue in displeasure.Ignorant of it all, Owen groaned gently pressing his temples as if he had a headache. Then he stuttered and spoke.\u201cI\u2019m not sure what kind of person sir is because this is our first time meeting\u2026.. but my daughter is not here. She is going to get married soon. So, she will live happily\u2026.. comfortably, and well.\u201dAt first glance, he seemed normal, but Owen\u2019s eyes were hazy with confusion and his tone was flat, dim and slurring. Akkard speculated his nervous and neurological system was confused by the drugs, and his mind had been fluctuating for a long time.Seeing that he was still able to endure this much, he was indeed Damia father. It seemed Damia\u2019s strong psyche was hereditary.However, it was not a time to leisurely admire. Having confirmed Damia\u2019s absence, there was no reason for him to linger with Count Primula.Akkard ascended back on his horse, assuring his would visit in the future.\u2018She\u2019s probably in Klaus\u2019 mansion.\u2019A memory flashed through his mind: Klaus\u2019 smooth face.He said he was of mixed heritage and had a pretty exotic and beautiful face.Some women preferred such a boyish, pretty face compared to a manly appearance. Maybe Damia did, too.Akkard was well aware of how sweet her gaze was. Those twinkling eyes that glistened in ecstasy. Any man would risk his life away to receive such attention.Has Damia ever looked at Klaus with those same sweet eyes that had looked at me?Imagining the scene, another black. muddy, sticky emotion boiled up in his stomach. It was a dirty feeling he had often these days.It suddenly occurred to Akkard:If I arrive at the Count\u2019s estate and see Damia is smiling happily, with my own two eyes\u2014I may go crazy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He felt apologetic, but Akkard became as pleased as she was displeased.Regardless, he couldn\u2019t stand the sight of a kid chasing her.He hadn\u2019t even had his fill of her, nor did he tire of her yet, so he found it annoying that all these flies were hovering around her, waiting for their chance with her if there was the slightest lapse in his vigilance.Because of this, for the first time in his life, Akkard was overwhelmed with a sense of crisis, worried she would be taken away from him. However, the moment he witnessed the scene that seemed to have turned his worries into reality, more violence than necessary had swelled in his body.That\u2019s why he had beaten Klaus recklessly. He even punched and crushed Klaus\u2019 pretty face with a fist full of emotion. So even if that face was to Damia\u2019s taste, now there was no reason for her to pay him any mind again.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026 Thank you so much for your help.\u201dDamia, ignorant of his insidious feelings, thanked him with a bare expression. Then suddenly, she tilted her head and asked:\u201cBut, Sir Akkard\u2026. How did you know I was here?\u201dAkkard flinched. He couldn\u2019t say that he had chased her all the way here when he heard she was engaged to another man. It was because Damia, who listened to this, was sure to ask questions such as, \u2018Why did you do that?\u2019Unfortunately, Akkard has yet to find the answer himself.Of course, he could come up with excuses. For example, information needed to be exchanged, how it was challenging to be involved in the conspiracy of the High Temple. Or that he was a possessive man; he couldn\u2019t allow someone else to steal her away from him before he threw her away.However, his body acted before he could think of all these rationales and excuses. Even before he could figure out these reasons, he had jumped on the horse and ran.And while he drove his horse the fastest it could go until they were both similarly panting, there was only one thought that came to mind:\u2018If anyone touches her, I will kill them.\u2019She\u2019s mine. So no one can dare touch her.Akkard could recall those thoughts clearly. The moment he saw Klaus pressing down on Damia\u2019s body that only he knew so far, his murderous intent took root in the depths of his heart.All the hairs all over his body were standing up, on edge. Akkard was very unfamiliar with these feelings, so he continued to try to find answers to Damia\u2019s questions.He was always indifferent outside of bed, and the one who cried and was clingy was always a woman. Their fierce jealousy and strong lingering feelings were as black and hot as melted tar. But even they often froze to pieces and broke when those feelings of theirs hit Akkard\u2019s cold heart.It was the first time. These ugly, wretched, and pathetic feelings that exposed his underside like this. That\u2019s why Akkard was even more confused.\u201cSir Akkard\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7?\u201dPuzzled, Damia stared at him when he didn\u2019t answer. She blinked a couple of times, spoke calmly:\u201cIf it\u2019s a difficult question to answer, you don\u2019t have to. I just asked because I was curious.\u201dDamia didn\u2019t want to trouble him. She didn\u2019t know how Akkard came all the way here, but all she knew was that he helped her regardless. It was not the right thing to question and embarrass her savior.\u201cShall we go now? We have to get out of here before Countess Hwari returns,\u201dDamia said as she grabbed Klaus\u2019 pants, which kept slipping off her waist.Only then did Akkard, who belatedly came to his senses, open the window of the drawing-room and help Damia escape through the window.It was fortunate that they got out safely, but there was one minor problem. Damia looked up at the \u201cmeans of transportation\u201d brought by Akkard with her eyes wide open.\u201cI couldn\u2019t bring the carriage because I was in a rush. Do you know how to ride a horse?\u201d\u201cAh, yes. I know how to ride, but\u2026\u201dDamia gawked at the black stallion, who was as big as a house. Its shiny eyes regarded Damia, who was much smaller than his owner as if she were insignificant.\u201cH-hi?\u201d\u201c[sfx] *Snort*!\u201dThe black steed rose his head and snorted at Damia\u2019s awkward greeting. It was a sign that he would not acknowledge a weakling like her. Damia, who is only accustomed to gentle and pretty white mares, became very embarrassed.\u201cCome on, get on.\u201dUnaware of this, Akkard casually lifted Damia by her waist to reach the saddle. It was fortunate that she wore men\u2019s clothing, even though the pants were loose. Thanks to this, it wasn\u2019t that difficult to ride a horse.Fortunately, perhaps because the owner, Akkard, was next to her, the black steed allowed Damia to mount easily.After putting her on the stallion, Akkard ascended his horse, sitting in front of her in one sleek movement like a leopard. He indifferently held the reins.\u201cI\u2019m going to start, so hold on to my waist.\u201dDamia hesitated but then wrapped her arms around his waist. Even though it was trivial contact, it felt strangely unfamiliar.Wondering why she realized he was always the one who touched her body. However, it was the first time Damia initiated contact and hugged Akkard\u2019s body first, so it felt bizarre.The large black horse showed no signs of difficulty though it carried two adults. Damia glanced down at the ground and was dizzy from the tremendous height.\u2018If I fall from here, at the very least, I\u2019ll have a fracture.\u2019Naturally, her arm tightened around Akkard\u2019s waist. Her movements made Akkard chuckle and tease her:\u201cOkay. Hold on tight like that.\u201dIt\u2019s even better if you wrap your legs around too.Damia sighed at his additional words.\u201cDon\u2019t say weird things. Let\u2019s just go.\u201dAkkard\u2019s back and waist under her arms were thick, with solid bumpy muscles moving under her hands. It was incredibly hard for her to believe that such a body belonged to a human.His body temperature was hot under the thin summer clothes, making Damia feel awkward.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Akkard and Damia were both lost in thought.Now out of a crisis, Damia\u2019s complicated situation that she had to deal with came to mind and confused her. In particular, Damia\u2019s father occupied her heart the most.Her father seemed very tired and distressed. After only a few months, he had aged rapidly, perhaps because his work was hard. Although he tried to marry Damia as Cesare wanted because of the influence of drugs\u2026..he was probably sincere when he said he wanted her to live in peace.When she thought of her father, the tip of my nose started to run. Damia tried not to sniffle and took a deep breath. She calmly opened her mouth.\u201cSir Akkard.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cRegarding our conversation the other day\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 I mean, when we were talking about drug addiction\u2014Is there an antidote?\u201dIt was dangerous\u2014such a question threatened the wall she built up to keep her emotions at bay. She almost cried, her voice almost cracking as she asked. Damia never wanted to show tears outside of bed. Especially in front of Akkard.Sometimes some things could be understood without words. Damia had slept with him only twice, but Damia had vaguely noticed such a fact in the back of her; the fact that many women\u2019s hearts must have broken and shattered before this man\u2019s beauty and indifference.Akkard Valerian was a man who seemed to have been molded from the tears of countless women. And Damia didn\u2019t want to be one of them.Fortunately, Akkard readily answered the question before she became more emotional.\u201cA cure? Of course there is.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026really? Then can I get some? How long do we have to wait to make it?\u201dAt the good news, Damia hung on to the hope without even realizing it.Since there weren\u2019t such drugs in the north, it\u2019s antidote and treatment was unfamiliar.Akkard, who had an idea why she was asking this question, inquired in a soft voice.\u201cIt seems Count Primula was drugged. Am I right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes.\u201dDamia choked up.In order not to shed tears, she stared up at the sky.Fortunately, Akkard did not notice her emotional change. It was because her answer was so short that it was hard to tell, and Damia was sitting behind him, so there was no way to know what expression she was making.\u201cIf it\u2019s the same thing as the neurological drugs that have recently spread to the South, it\u2019s not just a simple antidote. It has to be an antidote mixed with holy water made in the High Temple.\u201d\u201cMade in the High Temple\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cYes. Fortunately, Lessid Perry knows how to make it. If I contact him today, I\u2019ll bring it to you within a few days. Don\u2019t worry too much.\u201dDamia let out a sigh of deep relief. When the problem that had troubled her the most was solved, the tension all over her body was loosened.So she leaned her forehead, clinging more tightly to Akkard\u2019s back without realizing it.\u201cHmm.\u201dAkkard smiled with a satisfied countenance. Sometimes there are things that can be known through actions and facial expressions without words. He could feel Damia\u2019s vigilance against him gradually softening little by little from her trivial actions.\u201cUmm\u2026\u201dDamia felt her eyelids gradually getting heavier. The horse saddle, which swayed consistently, strangely resembled a cradle. Akkard\u2019s body, sitting in front of her, was very strong and warm, so against it her eyes started to close on their own.\u201cIf you\u2019re sleepy, take a nap. I\u2019ll wake you up when we arrive.\u201dJust as Akkard said that, Damia closed her eyes, losing the fight against her exhaustion. She fell asleep in less than a minute.\u201cDamia.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There were powerful gusts of wind sweeping the wildflower fields, but since it was summer, for the north, these gales were comparatively mild.Damia sat on the floor, brushing her frizzy hair behind her ears. The carpet and cushion laid out by the coachman were so thick that she sat on the ground with comfort.It was thirty minutes passed the agreed-upon appointment time, but the person she was waiting for did not come easily.However, Damia was not impatient or angry; because he was such an important person.\u201cLady Damia.\u201dFinally, the man she had been desperately waiting for had arrived.Damia\u2019s breathing quickened, and her heart pounded.She licked her parched lips, stood up and greeted him:\u201cPriest Lessid.\u201dThe young man in white looked just like a forest fairy. His long blonde hair fluttered in the wind as he approached and bowed his hair, as if highlighting his delicate beauty.\u201cForgive me for being late. It took longer than I thought to make an antidote.\u201dAt the same time his pleasant voice rang out, Lessid took out the antidote out of his chest pocket and held it out.Damia\u2019s eyes shook as if she was on the verge of crying.\u201c\u2026 Thank you so much. Thank you.\u201dWith both hands gingerly accepting the antidote, she hugged it tightly to her chest. It was the precious medicine that could save her drug-addicted father.Naturally, her eyes gazing at Lessid, who made it, were full of sincere gratitude.\u201cOh, no need for thanks, of course\u2014I just did what I had to do.\u201dUnhonest, Lessid laid his eyes down and waved his hands.However, his body was very honest, so when he was thanked by Damia, his ears slightly turned red.Since becoming a priest, Lessid developed a distaste for humans. People often judged each other by their profession and asked for something in their self-interest. For example, to the baker, \u2018How can I bake some snacks?\u2019 Or, to the doctor, \u2018I have a headache today, please look after me.\u2019It didn\u2019t matter if they were close. Yet, it was natural for people who only recognized their faces. To Lessid it was disgusting to ask for such services only by looking at their livelihood.Even if he refused to do such things, he was cursed, people saying he didn\u2019t even know the \u2018duty of the god\u2019 and predictably he earned the ire of his fellow humans.In particular, Lessid, who was sensitive and fussy naturally, did not deal with criticism well. Thanks to this, even though he was born with great holy healing powers he seriously contemplated resigning from his priesthood but\u2026.\u2018If it wasn\u2019t for Lady Damia I would have quit right away.\u2019It had been Damia who had saved his devastated and withering heart.Before, Lessid had no interest in her.Of course, Damia was as pretty as a doll when he was young, but so was Louise, his younger sister.Lessid disdained the selfish Louise that was only revealed to him. He assumed all young girls thought the world revolved around them.So, he had not bothered to get closer to Damia who was of a similar age. In turn, Lessid was always cold to her while they took a painting class together.Even if Damia spoke to him, he often responded with a short answer or ignored her all together.Then one day, Damia, while painting on an easel across from him, kept coughing.\u201cCough, cough,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ha*.\u201d [*laboured breathing]It was a pitiful and painful noise, like a young puppy vomiting up its mother\u2019s milk. Intent on ignoring her, Lessid\u2019s eyebrows furrowed and tried to focus on his painting.\u2018Annoying.\u2019At the time, he was already a new priestly disciple. Although he had not officially been inaugurated yet, he already knew how to handle his powers to some extent. He would be able to deal with a cold like that.\u2018Probably you\u2019re coughing in front of me for that.\u2019Wait and see. Damia would soon shamelessly ask him for a favor, too: \u2018Please cure my cold.\u2019Lessid waited silently, absentmindedly moving his brush irrelevantly on his nearly finished canvas.Yet, Damia had been quiet the entire three-hour painting class. Rather, even her usual light chatter was conspicuously absent, making Lessid even more uncomfortable.\u201c\u2026\u2026Coughing!\u201cAs Damia coughed loudly and painfully, her voice broke and she met his eyes.She looked reddish and flushed, perhaps with fever, and her eyes teared up and the tip of her nose was red and swollen.Taking in the sight Lessid frowned. Damia lowered her eyes and quietly apologized:\u201cI\u2019m sorry. My coughing was loud, wasn\u2019t it?\u201dSpeechless, Lessid looked at her in astonishment.Her apologetic face seemed sincere, as she mumbled she would be better by the next class.Was it because of that?Lessid felt like he could faithfully fulfill his \u2018priestly duties\u2019 for the first time in a long time.\u201cDo you have a cold? Let\u2019s see,\u201dLessid narrowed his forehead, stood up from his seat and approached her.Damia shook her head and stepped back. Then, her voice cracked from her illness as she said something extraordinary:\u201cDon\u2019t come too close. You could get sick.\u201dLessid was truly at a loss for words. He was familiar with humans asking to treat their dirty, bloody wounds and taking him for granted.But she was worried that he would get a measly cold!What a foolish and lovely girl she was.Perhaps that\u2019s why his heart suddenly began to beat loudly. To hide this, Lessid spoke out, flustered,\u201cDid you forget that I\u2019m going to be a priest soon? I\u2019ll do this for you today, so come here.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dOnly then did Damia\u2019s face flicker with a realization. It was a great honor in the North to work for the High Temple. Therefore, she was also aware that Lessid Ferra was training to become a priest. Nevertheless,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201cRegardless, it\u2019s okay. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll get better after a few days of rest.\u201dLessid stared blankly at Damia\u2019s smile. He couldn\u2019t hold back all the questions flooding his head, so he ended up spitting them out:\u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It\u2019s not a big deal for me, who will become a priest anyway, so why are you refusing?\u201dDamia blinked at his unexpected question.She had taken the same class with Lessid for months, but it was the first time he had spoken so many words to her.Damia carefully chose her words with her eyes cast down and finally opened her mouth:\u201cWell\u2026. I just need to take care of myself. I\u2019m definitely a nuisance.\u201d\u201cWhat? A nuisance?\u201d\u201cYes. No matter how much you want to be a priest, it\u2019s not natural to use your power for me. You\u2019re not obligated to do that in the first place,\u201dDamia said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d and blurred the end of her sentence.Strange, the words she said were thoughts that had been long buried deep in Lessid\u2019s heart.Why do they take my service for granted? Why do they feel entitled to me? It\u2019s not my fault that I was born with healing powers. Why do you feel permitted to my efforts when you didn\u2019t do anything for me?Lessid couldn\u2019t understand peoples\u2019 shamelessness and brazen way of thinking. Nonetheless, there were too many irregularities and hypocrisies in the world. Everytime, he bumped into them, Lessid felt his mind and heart slowly breaking down.At this point, when Lessid had doubted himself and thought he might be the insane one, Damia spoke his thoughts out loud. He was not going crazy.Lessid was touched by her words.But, being in the midst of puberty, overwhelmed with confusion, he masked his feelings with dishonesty, spoke in a sullen tone and reached out his hand.\u201c\u2026It\u2019s because I can\u2019t concentrate because of your loud coughing and wheezing. Don\u2019t you know it\u2019s more of an inconvenience to keep talking as you cough next to me? So keep still and let me treat you.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t deliberate, but what he said acutely pricked Damia\u2019s fear of being a burden to others.\u201cThen, excuse me.\u201dHesitant, Damia closed her eyes and let him put his hands on her face looking as pretty as a fairy.Lessid tried to defuse the heat in his red cheeks. He generously used his holy healing power on Damia.\u201cIt\u2019s done. You can now open your eyes.\u201dDamia, who opened her eyes, looked surprised. Until a while ago, her fever rose, her tonsils were swollen and now her sore throat was much more comfortable.Damia, who touched her neck absentmindedly smiled at Lessid.\u201cThank you so much. As expected, you\u2019re amazing as people say.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dLessid, who managed to arrange his facial expression, turned his head away. It was the most special and pleasant thank you he\u2019d ever heard.Thanks to this, he had grinned for a long time while recalling the memory, to Louise\u2019s ire.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on with you, brother? What\u2019s wrong with you these days? You keep bumping into things\u2014it\u2019s annoying!\u201dOf course, Lessid ignored his sister with a pathetic look.Damia, who was the same age, was so thoughtful and dwelled on subjects deeply.Anyway, it was thanks to Damia he had come to accept his healing abilities positively.\u2018And probably from then on\u2026. My heart, too\u2026\u2019Lessid stared at Damia, who held the antidote preciously in her arms. She looked much more mature and beautiful now, but her talent in thanking people was the same now as it was back then.\u201cI will never forget this grace. I hope you\u2019ll accept a small gift in return\u2026.\u201dMeeting his eyes, Damia spoke sincerely, her gaze full of emotion as if she were looking at her savior.Her moist blue eyes were too fatal. Lessid, who couldn\u2019t bear to look straight into her eyes, was embarrassed and quickly waved his hand.\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. I don\u2019t need that.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026. I\u2019m deeply indebted to you. Please let me express my thanks.\u201dDamia\u2019s hands came together and stepped towards him. Her hair flew in the wind and a sweet smell wafted towards him. Overwhelmed and short circuiting, Lessid uttered something in confusion before he could stop himself\u2014trying to stop her approach.\u201cI don\u2019t need a reward! If you must, please send it to Sir Akkard. He\u2019s the one who asked me to make an antidote as soon as possible.\u201dDamia\u2019s eyes grew at the same time as Lessid, who finished speaking, realized his mistake.\u201cWhat? Akkard\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Really?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Fortunately though, wherever he was, he wasn\u2019t in the mansion.Instead, what greeted her was Owen with hazy eyes, and asked:\u201cOh, my dear. Did you meet your fiance well? How was it?\u201d\u201cYes, father. It was a good time.\u201dDamia\u2019s smile was stretched too thin and about to crack as she suppressed her mournful desperation inside. Recalling the conspiracy she almost fell for at Klaus\u2019 hands a chill ran up her spin.However, she couldn\u2019t blame Owen for not being sound of mind. Aware her father fell victim and was suffering the most at the hands of Cesare, Damia unwound her coiled up emotions. Naturally, she recommended tea to Owen.\u201cThat\u2019s why, Father. I have something to say concerning my marriage. Would you like to have a cup of tea?\u201dIn the absence of Cesare, it was not difficult to feed Owen the antidote. He was so confused, he didn\u2019t even notice that something was mixed in his drink.\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m feeling a little weird, sweetheart. I have a headache and feel very drowsy. I need to get some rest.\u201dHaving sipped his tea to the last drop Owen stood up and massaged his temples. Taking in the sight, Damia was not alarmed and helped her father go to his room.\u201cGet some rest, father. You will get well soon.\u201dOwen, lying in bed, began perspiring profusely. They were symptoms of detoxification that Lessid had informed her in advance.Unperturbed, Damia was comforted by the fact the drugs in his system would flow out with that sweat.\u2018After two days of suffering, you\u2019ll be back to normal.\u2019Once Owen was detoxified from the drug and returned to his senses, she was going to reveal everything about Cesare. Then Cesare would be ousted out. She had no reluctance about it, indeed he was the cuckoo who entered the nest and the intruder one who tried to kick out the rightful owners of her family.If she didn\u2019t know anything else, she was sure that she could never forgive him for poisoning her father. Her sharp, cold glare glanced at Cesare\u2019s room and returned to her own bedroom.On the shelf there was the empty glass bottle that had originally held the antidote from Lessid.Damia threw it into the fireplace, worried that even the slightest evidence would indite Lessid and he would be punished by the High Temple.\u2018You shouldn\u2019t cause trouble to your savior.\u2019Shortly after, the glass bottle was crushed. Damia let out a long sigh.All that was left for her to do was to wait for her father to be healed. Until then, she had to keep watch and stay in the mansion; Cesare might take advantage of the gap in her vigilance and do something else.\u2018While we wait, should we think about a gift in return?\u2019She had to stay home for two days anyway. In order to spend the time as practically as possible, Damia made plans.She called the maid to bring her high-quality cloth, lace, and colored thread for embroidery. They were the essentials for making embroidered handkerchiefs. She received such precious help from Lessid, she couldn\u2019t simply utter a word of thanks.\u2018Afterall, a simple gift would be the best gift in return. Summer is just around the corner too.\u2019Damia cut a piece of fabric and began to make designs for handkerchiefs. Then her fingertips paused for a moment at the thought that suddenly came to mind.\u2018Should I\u2026\u2026 make one for Sir Akkard?\u2019It was her thought, but immediately she felt a sense of rejection from her heart. There were too many obstacles to convey such gratitude in return.\u2018Like what happened in the locker.\u2019When Damia thought of Akkard, treating her like a courtesan back then, the thought of giving him something disappeared. But, it was also true she kept receiving his aid.Had it not been for Akkard, she wouldn\u2019t have known what happened to her father and how to solve it.She hated to admit it, but it was entirely thanks to Akkard that she was able to save her father.\u2018And he even came to help me at the Hwari Count\u2019s estate.\u2019Thanks to this, she successfully evaded a crisis and dodged the engagement to Klaus.When she recalled the help she received from him one after another, Damia became uneasy. After a long period of intense consideration, she decided to only express her sincerity.\u2018\u2026\u2026haa\u2026indeed, I can\u2019t leave out Sir Akkard in return.\u2019At this time, she hated her unnecessarily sincere personality. Damia sighed and began to draw another design. Even if the handkerchief she gave was stuck in the corner of a drawer, she had to put in geninity in it.Contrary to her troubled mind, her hands and the designs fell out effortlessly. Rather, opposite from what she had originally intended, Akkard\u2019s came out much prettier than Lessid\u2019s, embarrassing her.\u2018It would be quite worth seeing if it was completed.\u2019By this point, Damia began to feel motivated and her enthusiasm soured. She jumped into the embroidery in earnest, tying up her hair so that it wouldn\u2019t get in her way.Two and a half days later, when Owen woke up, two handkerchiefs had already been completed.\u201cWhat? Caesar did such things?\u201dOwen, who had been standing up for the first time in a long time and receiving his meal, asked back in surprise. He was still not feeling well and was wearing indoor clothes that came up to his neck even though it was summer.\u201cYes. It\u2019s true.\u201dDamia nodded with a bitter look at her father, who couldn\u2019t believe it at all. Then Owen frowned and was lost in thought.\u201cRight. No wonder\u2026\u2026 I did think it was strange at the time. It wasn\u2019t like me.\u201dThere were definitely some strange memories left in his head. On a night when he was alone with Cesare, he had been commanding him. And he found himself bowing and listening helplessly in front of him.It was blurry as if he had been drunk, but it seemed that hazy moments like that had happened. When Owen acknowledged her explanation, Damia sighed in relief, mumbling:\u201cI knew it was the drugs talking. Otherwise, how could father appoint Cesare as his successor, not me.\u201dRight? Damia asked, her heart wanting an answer, but Owen stayed silent. When she raised her head in doubt, Owen, who had an unreadable and complicated expression, was looking at her.\u201cFather?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It\u2019s just I\u2019m sorry to you,\u201dsaid Owen, his shoulders dropping helplessly.Damia thought her father\u2019s attitude was strange, but she could not ask why because Owen spoke first.\u201cBefore sending out Cesare, I should consult Noela in advance. She\u2019ll be upset, but there\u2019s nothing that can be done. Cesare was on the wrong side.\u201dIt meant that they should have a so-called \u201cparent conversation time.\u201d Where the couple alone talked in a place where neither Cesare nor Damia existed.\u201cYes, father. Have a good conversation.\u201dDamia, who understood Owen\u2019s meaning and stood up from her chair. She called in the maids to get groomed. She thought to leave the mansion completely:\u2018I should hand over the handkerchiefs in the morning.\u2019Damia carefully packed the beautifully wrapped gifts. She went to see Lessid first.In fact, the easiest and simplest way was to visit Count Ferria but if she did it could have raised suspicions of the temple instead. It was the reason she had met Lessid in the deserted plains for their last meeting when she received the antidote.So Damia headed to a tea party where Lessid would be attending. And as expected, she ran into Lessid, while he was walking through the garden.\u201cLady Damia \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7?\u201dLessid, who found her, looked surprised.Damia smiled at his face, which looked like a fairy of the vegetation. She discreetly nodded, conscious of their surroundings.\u201cCould you spare me a moment? Priest Lessid.\u201dIndeed, Lessid was delighted to receive the gift in return and seemed quite happy. A precious perfume Damia\u2019s father brought from another country was to his liking. In addition, there was no better news that the medicine he made saved her father.\u201cI\u2019m so glad that the treatment worked well. But you don\u2019t need to do this\u2026\u2026\u2026. but since you gave it to me, I\u2019ll be grateful.\u201dIt was a signal that Lessid was about to leave after he accepted the gift. As she lowered her eyes shyly, Damia held out something else.\u201cUh, and this\u2026..\u201d\u201cWhat is\u2026?\u201dLessid\u2019s eyes held a strange look as he took the soft fabric and unfolded it. Then, with a subtle scent of perfume, a delicately embroidered handkerchief appeared.Lessid\u2019s eyes grew bigger when he saw the patterns of the lily, symbols of his house, Count Ferria, and a handkerchief with his name engraved meticulously.\u201cThis\u2014couldn\u2019t be\u2026.\u201d\u201cYes, it is lacking, but I made it myself. Could you please accept it?\u201dAt Damia\u2019s words, Lessid seemed to harden. With the handkerchief spread out in both hands, Lessid mouth was closed and stiff and at first glance looked angry.As she watched him Damia tilted her head and looked worried:\u2018Is he unhappy?\u2019Fortunately, Lessid soon came to his senses, began folding his handkerchief. The corners were accurately matched without an inch of error. His expression was grim and serious as a child learning how to fold a small cloth for the first time.Without a single smile, Lessid, who hugged the handkerchief to his chest and\u00a0 bowed his head while expressing his sincere gratitude:\u201cThis gift, thank you so much. I\u2019ll sincerely cherish it.\u201d\u201c\u2026 What? Oh\u2014Yes, yes. Thank you for accepting,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201dEven before Damia\u2019s words were over, Lessid turned around. It was to hide the tips of his mouth that kept soaring in overwhelming joy.Enjoying the soft feeling of the handkerchief in his hands, Lessid sincerely thought:\u2018I\u2019m glad I was born.\u2019Entirely clueless, Damia, looked at his back with round eyes like a rabbit. Lessid\u2019s steps, which elegantly extended as usual, but there was a strange feeling that he was hopping.\u2018Is it just my wishful thinking?\u2019Regardless, it was fortunate that Lessid didn\u2019t refuse. Damia smiled softly while stroking her cheek, turned around.Now it was time to go to give Akkard a gift.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
